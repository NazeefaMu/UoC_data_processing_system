SIA and Lufthansa Group launch joint venture for more flights

Singapore Airlines (SIA) and Lufthansa Group have entered into a joint venture co-operation covering flights between Singapore, Australia and Germany, Switzerland, Austria and Belgium, from October 1.
Customers can choose from a wider range of travel itineraries and fare products that will be progressively offered by the airlines under the joint venture agreement.
Since November 2015, when both airline groups signed the joint venture agreement, they have expanded capacity between Singapore and both Germany and Switzerland. This includes the introduction of new SIA-operated flights between Singapore and Dusseldorf in July 2016.
In March 2017, SWISS deployed its new Boeing 777-300ER aircraft on daily flights between Singapore and Zurich. Lufthansa has also announced plans to re-introduce services between Singapore and Munich from March 2018.
These benefits will further enhance existing Star Alliance arrangements that customers enjoy on SIA, Lufthansa, SWISS and Austrian Airlines. On the same date, flights operated by SIA, Lufthansa and SWISS between Singapore and Dusseldorf, Frankfurt, Munich and Zurich will be included in a revenue-sharing agreement between the two airline groups.
The two airline groups have also significantly increased codeshare ties, with over 130 city pairs now offered between key markets in Europe, Southeast Asia and Southwest Pacific.
“We are pleased to launch our joint venture with Lufthansa Group, which has provided a strong foundation for us to work together to enable more flight frequency and enhanced travel options for customers of both airline groups.
This joint venture demonstrates what we can achieve with the right partner, and we look forward to working even closer with Lufthansa Group,” said Tan Kai Ping, Singapore Airlines Senior Vice President Marketing Planning. Dieter Vranckx, Lufthansa Group Airlines Vice President Sales Asia Pacific, said, “This is a remarkable milestone for both Lufthansa Group and Singapore Airlines. With the launch of this joint venture, the two premium airline groups are jointly able to optimise the product offerings and high-quality services in a very competitive market throughout Europe, Southeast Asia and Southwest Pacific”.
