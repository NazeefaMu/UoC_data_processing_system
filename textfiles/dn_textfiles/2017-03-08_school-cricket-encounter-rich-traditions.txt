A school cricket encounter with rich traditions

The rich traditions of the world’s second oldest inter-school cricket encounter will continue for the 138th occasion when Royal takes on S.Thomas’ in their Battle of the Blues three-day cricket encounter which begins at SSC grounds on Thursday.
Even two world wars could not stop the Royal-Thomian encounter which had begun way back in 1879. Since then, the two leading cricket-playing schools have met each other every year - uninterrupted.
From its centenary encounter in 1979, the Battle of the Blues big match was upgraded to a three-day affair – another first in local school cricket.
Since then, the last 37 matches in the series have been three-day games, except in 1985.
The inaugural match between Colombo Academy (as Royal College was then called) and S. Thomas College, Mutwal (which later moved to Mt. Lavinia) had both students as well as teachers in their respective teams. Ashley Walker captained Colombo Academy while a staff member Rev. S.J. Meyrick led the Thomian team. However, this match is not considered in the Battle of the Blues series as both schools had several staff members in their teams.
But from the following year, only students represented the respective teams. Royal (then Colombo Academy) had the honour of winning the 1880 encounter by 62 runs at Galle Face grounds, which hosts Galle Face Hotel at present.
In its proud and rich cricket history, the Reid Avenue School has produced some top cricketers who had played for Sri Lanka with distinction. Heading that galaxy of world class players is former Royal, NCC and Sri Lanka captain Ranjan Madugalle, now the Chief ICC Match Referee.
Madugalle led Royal in the 100th Battle of the Blues encounter and in the same year, he was adjudged the Observer Schoolboy Cricketer of the Year.
The longest unbeaten run by the Reid Avenue boys in the Battle of the Blues series was from 1965 to 1987. During the 23-year period without a single big match defeat, Royal emerged victorious on two occasions (1969 and 1983) while the rest of the 21 games were drawn. Royal registered back-to-back victories in 1990 and 1991 under Udaya Lakmal Wijesena and Rohan Irriyagolla respectively.
Sumithra Warnakulasuriya’s marathon knock of 197 in the 1980 big match continues to be the highest individual innings in the series. Besides Warnakulasuriya, the only other Royalist to score a ‘big match century’ on debut was Jagath Pattiarachchi, who cracked an unbeaten 100 in 1974. Nigel Fernando is the youngest ever Royal captain in the series. He was only six days short of his 17th birthday when he led the Reid Avenue school in 1989.
Royal's Rochana Jayawardene produced the best all-round effort in the series with a blistering knock of 145 not out and a match bag of 9 for 97 (5 for 29 and 4 for 44) in 1983. Prior to that, Barney Gunasekera of Royal too, had an impressive match analysis a top score of 148 and 7 for 57 in 1930.
The Thomians are better known for their fighting qualities which have been evident in the series. Having lost the 2006 encounter, the Thomians came back fighting the following year (2007) under Ashan Peiris to beat the Royalists by an innings. Since then, there have been five consecutive drawn encounters.
The Thomian grit was once again evident when they escaped from the jaws of defeat as Royal came close of winning the 2009 match. But the Thomian second-wicket pair of Fahim Saleem (165) and the captain Ravichandra Niroshan (100) defied the Royal bowling for 10 hours and 44 minutes, adding 232 for the second wicket which virtually sealed the chances of a Royal win.
S.Thomas’ has an equally rich cricket history, producing several top Sri Lanka cricketers in the past. Heading that list of Thomian cricketing legends is former Sri Lanka captain and ex-chairman of selectors, Duleep Mendis. He represented S. Thomas’ from 1970 and 1972 scoring back to back centuries in 1971 and 1972, captaining his alma mater in the final year. He still accounts for the highest individual innings for S.Thomas’ (184).
His nephew B.C. M.S. Mendis represented College from 1991 to 1994 scoring two centuries and one half century. He too captained the side in 1994.
Duleep Mendis's son R.S Mendis (2003-2005) was the vice captain of the victorious 2005 team and also scored a half century.
M.O. Gunaratne’s superb all-round effort, scoring 107 and capturing 7 for 34 in 1935 is considered the best double by a Thomian. L.H.Arndt had an outstanding bowling figures of 6 for 26 and 8 for 28 in 1905 match for the Mount Lavinia school.
The Royal-Thomian is much more than a mere inter-school cricket match or just another big match. It has been the annual meeting place for thousands of old boys of the two schools and their supporters, maintaining high traditions of the two of the oldest cricket playing schools in the country.
Even the Heads of State, including the late President J.R. Jayewardene, and many Ministers and parliamentarians, made it a habit of taking time off their busy schedules to catch the excitement which is unique for the Royal-Thomian.
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe too has been a notable spectator at the series and was the proud chief guest when Royal beat S. Thomas’ by four wickets at last year’s encounter.
