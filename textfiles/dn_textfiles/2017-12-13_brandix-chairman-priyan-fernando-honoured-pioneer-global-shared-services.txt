Brandix Chairman Priyan Fernando honoured as pioneer in global shared services

Brandix Chairman Priyan Fernando has been felicitated with the prestigious Leadership Award by Shared Services Forum India (SSF) for his contribution as a pioneering business leader to global shared services during his tenure as Executive Vice President, Global Business Services of American Express.
The honour was bestowed on Fernando at the 2017 Global Shared Services Conclave held in New Delhi recently.
In its felicitation, Shared Services Forum stated that Fernando was recognised for pioneering financial shared servicing in India and for his creativity in leading global shared services and enterprise-wide transformation, delivering value and impact to business, industry and society.
The Forum noted that “in his most recent position as Executive Vice President, Global Business Services (GBS) of American Express, he was responsible for all internal servicing of this $32 billion payments and services company with a presence in over 130 markets.”
“This organisation, which he built from the ground up, today delivers all financial, procurement, real estate, human resources and business transformation support across the entire American Express enterprise. His pioneering work has sown the seeds of innovation and excellence for many shared services organisations,” SSF said.
In his acceptance message, Fernando said that setting up of shared services in an organisation can be done only with uncompromising grit and integrity. He recognised the footprints of all those professionals and leaders who have shaped the shared services industry to what it is today, and declared that “shared services are pivotal to transformation and winning in the market place.”
Priyan Fernando was appointed a non-executive director of the Brandix Group in 2011, and succeeded Deshamanya Ken Balendra as Chairman of the Group in May 2013, upon the latter's retirement. a
