‘Government adheres to legal framework regarding refugees’

The Government will never act outside the existing legal framework or the correct practice in connection with the refugee problem.
It has never decided to grant Sri Lanka citizenship or a resident visa to any refugee either, stated the Ministry of Law and Order and Southern Development in a press release, yesterday.
The release said people and organisations with narrow political objectives were trying to mislead the public through false information and threaten the country's communal and religious harmony by using the Rohingya refugee crisis created due to the internal political situation in Myanmar.
Therefore, we should express our regret about the illegal action taken on September 26 while a group of Rohingya refugees handed over to the UNHCR by the government were temporarily accommodated in Ratmalana held in detention by the UNHCR. Three police officers were also injured during this incident. After this dispute, the Rohingya people were sent to a detention camp in Boosa at the request of the UNHCR.
