Scan Technologies' airconditioners save over 50% of energy costs

In a bid to save energy in existing buildings Scan Technologies Global Private Limited, is introducing modern air conditional systems, thus helping to save over 50% of energy costs.
The company which has over ten years of experience in installing, maintaining and servicing elevators and escalators, has already installed a modem AC plant and new system to JAIC Hilton and this is helping to save the company over 55% of its energy costs, said Keerthi Abeynayake, Chairman, Scan Technologies Global Private Limited.
He said that doing away with traditional cooling methods and moving away from huge cooler and chiller rooms, they use copper wires and other new technology to reduce energy costs.
“Another unique feature of this system is that one area like a public area of a building could be selected and the air conditioning can be regulated to have more cooling. Similarly when under use, this area could be shut down from the control room.”
He said any existing building using the traditional cooling systems could be switched on to this new system by installing their systems which do not need huge changes to the infrastructure of a building.
He also said that they are into elevators and have introduced an elevator which could operate for 25 minutes even in a fire situation. “With the inflow of tourism, we see a large potential for the growth in the hospitality industry and our tie up with KONE, a world class brand, will strengthen our confidence in serving the market much better.” KONE, a global leader in the elevator and escalator industry, has expanded its operations in the Sri Lankan market and has entered into a distribution agreement with Scan Technologies Global Private Limited recently.
“This will also give us additional strength to expand our business and offer better technology for clients,” said Abeynayake.
He said that they have a strong after sales service and has a fleet of vehicles including two Mercedes Benz vans to provide mobile assistance.
KONE’s history of innovation is one of the company’s success factors. With the megatrends like urbanization and technological disruption driving growth all over the world, KONE will be able to provide advanced solutions to the market and customers. In 2016, KONE had annual net sales of EUR 8.8 billion, and at the end of the year close to 52,000 employees. KONE Class B shares are listed on the Nasdaq.
