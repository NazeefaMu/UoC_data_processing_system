Dwindling water levels spell disaster for paddy cultivation

As a result of insufficient rains, the 2018 Yala paddy cultivation in Anuradhapura is in a quite backward position according to the data of the Anuradhapura Assistant Agrarian Development Commissioner Asanka Somawansa.
The number of farmers that have obtained the Yala fertilizer subsidy is 27,146 where the landscape under paddy cultivation is just 50,125 hectares. The 2018 Yala cultivation season is now reaching its end.
The initial plan that 88,000 farmers to be facilitated to cultivate 78,000 hectares have been an utter failure, Fertilizer Secretariat’s Anuradhapura Assistant Director Ajith Kumara said. He mentioned that so far only 3,500 mt of MOP, TSP and Urea fertilizer have been issued out of the quantity envisaged to be sold at subsidized rate was 25000 mt.
Anuradhapura Agrarian Assistant Commissioner said further that only under 25 percent of the 3,400 minor irrigation tanks come under his department in the district.
Quoting an example, he pointed out that in Kebithigollewa agrarian development jurisdiction, the irrigable landscape was 16,500 acres and only 20 acres have been cultivated in current Yala.
Somawansa said that in majority of 42 agrarian development jurisdictions, there has no paddy or additional food crops cultivation realized at all.
In the meantime it is reported that the water levels in the 13 major tanks in the district have been fast dwindling and under these tanks, out of the total irrigable landscape only 25 percent have been under cultivation.
The Anuradhapura District Farmer Organization has shown their utter displeasure over the decreasing number of drought relief beneficiaries from 141,000 families down to 48,426.
