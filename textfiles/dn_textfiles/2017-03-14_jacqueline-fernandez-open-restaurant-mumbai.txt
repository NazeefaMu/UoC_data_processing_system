Jacqueline Fernandez to open a restaurant in Mumbai

 
Jacqueline Fernandez, who already owns a restaurant back home in Colombo, is all set to start one in Mumbai now.
Back in her hometown, the 31-year-old actress has teamed up with chef Dharshan Munidasa with her fine-dining restaurant, Kaema Sutra, which opened on July 14, 2014.
The furniture is colonial Lankan, its focal point is the authentic Sri Lankan Miris Gala or Grinding Stone, with the carefully designed Open Kitchen.
The cuisine draws inspiration from traditional local cuisine to dish out delicious street food.
 In Maximum City, she will be partnering with her bestie, Mishali Sanghani, who owns the popular Pali Village Café.
 A source close to the actress reveals that the new restaurant will be located in Bandra too, where the actress resides.
 "Jacqueline is known to be health conscious and a fitness freak. So the menu has been planned accordingly.
And even though she's in the midst of a hectic shoot for Tarun Mansukhani's Drive with Sushant Singh Rajput, she's taking time out to personally oversee the menu and décor," the source adds.
