Amended Establishment Code for better execution of RTI Act

The Establishment Code is to be amended to allow better execution of the Right to Information Act (RTI).
Public Administration,Management and Law and Order Minister Ranjith Madduma Bandara submitting a Cabinet proposal this week had pointed out that certain sections of the Establishment Code, namely Part II of the Code did not allow free access to government information.
Further, he asked that instructions be issued through a Circular to revise Part II of the Code. This was approved considering the advice of the Public Service Commission.
