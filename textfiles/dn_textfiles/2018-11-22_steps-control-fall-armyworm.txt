Steps to control Fall Armyworm

The Addalaichenai Agricultural Extension Centre took measures to control the spread of the invasive Fall Armyworm in the Ampara district.
The officials from the Agricultural Extension Centre conducted an awareness programme for farmers and warned them to be vigilant of the presence of the Fall Armyworm. Hand bills on crop protection against the Fall Armyworm, were also distributed among the participants.
Under this project, an awareness programme organised by Addalaichenai Agricultural Extension Centre Agricultural Instructor and Officer In-Charge A. H. A. Mubarak, was held at the Market Square in Addalaichenai recently.
The Fall Army worm caterpillar has migrated from foreign countries. It destroys hundreds of acres of cultivation overnight and could affect over 100 species of crops including paddy, maize, sugarcane, green gram, vegetables and fruits, sources said.
The Agriculture Ministry and the Agriculture Department are jointly implementing this scheme. Addalaichenai Agricultural Extension Centre Agricultural Instructor and Officer In-Charge A. H. A. Mubarak, Farm Manager M. Y. M. Niyas, Crop Protection Officer A. Jainulabdeen, Agriculture Department officials, Agricultural Instructors and farmers were also present.
