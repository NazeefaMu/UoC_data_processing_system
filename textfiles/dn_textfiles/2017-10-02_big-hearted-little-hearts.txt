It is estimated that there are about 3000 children born with heart diseases every year in Sri Lanka. These children deserve a chance to live. One cannot possibly comprehend the acute feeling of loss that a parent experience if one is not a parent. Only a mother or father can truly know the intense feeling of pain associated with the loss of their child. 1000 – 1500 children with heart diseases and critical illnesses are lost every year due to a lack of facilities for treatment in Sri Lanka. This is why our hearts need to beat for their hearts. This is where the ‘Little Hearts’ Project comes in.
This is a project to construct and commission a ten storey Cardiac and Critical Care Complex at the Lady Ridgeway Hospital (LRH) for Children. This Hospital LRH is the premier public children’s hospital which provides treatment to children from all districts of Sri Lanka completely free or charge. In that sense, it is a National Children’s Hospital.
“Even though we commonly simplify it as a hole in the heart, what is actually means is a structural abnormality in the heart. It may be a hole in the heart, a leaking or a narrow valve, a narrow blood vessel taking blood out of the heart or a combination of these defects,” said Consultant Pediatric Cardiologist at the Lady Ridgeway Hospital, Dr. Duminda Samarasinghe.
Compared to most of the countries in the region, we (Sri Lanka) are in a very much better position. We can treat approximately 50% of children with heart diseases in Sri Lanka totally free of charge. If you take India, it can treat only about 10-20% of its CHD burden and that is also mostly through private sector hospitals. All other SAARC countries have the same situation.
“Lady Ridgeway Hospital for Children (LRH) is the premier public children’s hospital which provides treatment to children from all corners of Sri Lanka, completely free of charge. It is in fact the largest Children’s Hospital in the world.
However, when it comes to heart diseases and critical illnesses, it is not in a position to provide timely and appropriate treatment to all children in need, unintentionally, and inadvertently endangering the lives of thousands of such children every year.
Out of 3000 children born every year with heart diseases it has facilities to treat only about 1500. In the Medical Intensive Care Unit (ICU), around 100 requests are made to admit critically ill children to the ICU every month, but sadly, it can accommodate only 30-40.
This clearly highlights the need for expansion in a formidable quest towards saving these children,” explained Dr. Samarasinghe.
The Sri Lanka Navy is involved with the construction of the building. HE the president has ordered the Sri Lanka Navy to takeover construction upon the request made by the Little Hearts team. The Navy is fully geared to do it and is doing a great job.
Everybody at LRH appreciate their work as they have seen the difference of what the Navy is doing compared to normal contractors. The entire cost is two billion LKR.
It is also heartening to note that DSL Enterprises has announced their participation in the Little Hearts Project.
DSL Enterprises together with its own subsidiary Bluminz (Pvt) Ltd, has introduced a new pen, ‘Speed Little Hearts’ as well as a new pencil named ‘Camlin Little Hearts’. The company has pledged to donate 20 percent and 13 percent of the proceeds earned from the sale of the pen and Pencil respectively to the ‘Little Hearts’ project.
“Since its inception, the company has focused on developing safe innovative ideas with the final aim of advancing the human life. With the recent restructuring process of the organization, the management wanted to participate in a CSR project and of the many options before us, we selected the ‘Little Hearts’ project, as we felt that it was the most deserving of our attention,” said Group CEO of DSL Enterprises Chamara Narangoda.
