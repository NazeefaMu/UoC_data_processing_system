Ministry procedures to be streamlined: Duminda

The present procedures of the Disaster Management Ministry would be streamlined in order to execute a wider range of services to disaster victims, Irrigation and Water Resources and Disaster Management Minister Duminda Dissanayake said recently.
Referring to the reforms intended to be introduced, the minister told the Daily News that the public had complained that the Disaster Management Ministry had so far only been functioning to address disasters when they struck, and had not taken the necessary steps to prevent them from occurring.
So far, affected persons had only been transported to emergency shelters. Under the second phase of traditional disaster relief services, housing compensations as well as gratuities for buying kitchen utensils are provided, leaving the victims satisfied only until the next disaster occurs, he said, adding that the said practice would be done away with.
Dissanayake said that the Disaster Management Ministry would aim to carry out anticipatory preparations in order to prevent or minimise the damage caused by disasters, adding that top-priority would be given to establish an information centre at which such improvements could be made to thwart any disaster.
It would include the evacuation of encroachers through provisions of alternative living facilities, broadening narrow culverts and minor bridges as well as the construction of new culverts and bridges, aside from educating those who live in areas prone to disaster, he said, adding that it seemed that the mentality of the majority of disaster officials was that their duty was only to offer relief.
“They have not been properly trained or briefed about disaster-prevention. Under these circumstances, the Disaster Management Centre (DMC) and the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC) would have to be amalgamated to strengthen disaster-management services,” Dissanayake said. He said that as an example, if 10,000 persons were at a temporary camp during the next disaster, with proper information-gathering and execution, that number could be halved if another disaster were to occur in the future.
The minister said that the lack of cooperation and coordination between the Disaster Management Ministry and its stakeholders had been a hindrance in the minimisation and prevention of disasters.
Healthcare services, insurance agencies and banks as well as irrigation, land, housing and social service bodies and divisional secretaries were required to work together, which was at present, not being practiced to a satisfactory level, he said, adding that officials should always be vigilant, while maintaining close ties with people living in disaster zones.
