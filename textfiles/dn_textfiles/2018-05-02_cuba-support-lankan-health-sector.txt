Cuba to support Lankan health sector

The Cuban government has extended its support towards developing the Sri Lankan health sector, a Health Ministry spokesman said.
According to the spokesman, Cuban Public Health Minister Dr. Roberto Morales Ojeda expressed support when Health Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne met him on an invitation extended to him by the Cuban Health Minister.
The meeting was held during the International Convention ‘Cuba Salud 2018’ held from April 23 to 27, at the Havana Convention Center, Cuba, recently.
During the discussions, the two Ministers decided to sign an agreement in connection with obtaining drugs and medical equipment manufactured in Cuba to Sri Lanka through the State Pharmaceuticals Corporation (SPC).
More discussions will be held between Sri Lankan and Cuban health authorities before signing the agreement, he added.
