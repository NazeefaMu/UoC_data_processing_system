Cattle transport licences suspended

President Maithripala Sirisena has instructed to temporarily suspend issuing licenses to transport cattle.
Incidents of illegal transporting of cattle are rapidly increasing, while these activities had a huge impact on the dairy industry as well as agricultural needs.
Accordingly, until an appropriate process is implemented, the issuing of licenses to transport cattle would be temporarily suspended. At present, the issuing of licenses to transport cattle is initiated by the District Secretary. Various serious accidents and incidents resulting in fatality have been reported from different parts of the country, when illegally transporting cattle and a tragic incident reported from Bulankulama Anuradhapura, where two young women died in an accident on Thursday.
