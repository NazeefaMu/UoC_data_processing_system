“Mud fever” : Leptospirosis in dogs

Leptospirosis is a bacterial infection in dogs coursed by organism called L. Pomona. This organism damages the organs in the entire body, reproducing in the liver, kidneys, central nervous system, eyes, and reproductive system. The extent to which this bacteria affects the organs will depend on your dog’s immune system and its ability to eradicate the infection fully.
The Leptospira spirochete bacteria is zoonotic, meaning that it can be transmitted to humans and other animals and it is lethal to human. Children are most at risk of acquiring the bacteria from an infected pet while they handle the pet dog.
Spread of organism
This bacterium has special characteristic as it can burrow through the skin of the dog. Leptospires are transmitted to cattle via maintenance hosts. Maintenance hosts are a constant source of infection and typically do not show clinical signs. As silent-carrier animals, they maintain the bacteria and transmit Leptospires to other animals.
Transmission is efficient, with incidence of infection relatively high. Maintenance hosts can be carriers for months, years or even a lifetime. In the case of L. canicola, the sole maintenance host is the dog. As such, only dogs transmit the bacteria, infecting each other and other animals (cattle and pigs)
Area the organism live
The Leptospira spirochete infection mainly occurs in subtropical, tropical, and wet environments. Leptospira spirochetes are more prevalent in marshy/muddy areas which have stagnant surface water and are frequented by wildlife. The Leptospira bacteria in infected water, soil, or mud, while swimming, passing through, or drinking contaminated water, or from coming into contact with urine from an infected animal.
Most susceptible animals
Younger animals with less developed immune systems are at the highest risk for severe complications.
Signs
The organism affect the whole body of the dog getting sudden fever, sore in muscles, reluctance to move, stiffness in muscles, legs, stiff gait, shivering, weakness, depression, lack of appetite, increased thirst and urination, may be indicative of chronic renal (kidney) failure, progressing to inability to urinate, rapid dehydration, vomiting, possibly with blood, diarrhea - with or without blood in stool, bloody vaginal discharge, dark red speckled gums, yellow skin and/or whites of eyes – anemic symptoms, spontaneous cough, difficulty breathing, fast breathing, irregular pulse, runny nose, swelling of the mucous membrane, mild swelling of the lymph nodes
Leptospira spirochetes can remain in the kidneys, reproducing there and infecting the urine. Infection of the liver or kidneys can be fatal for animals if the infection progresses, causing severe damage to these organs.
Diagnosis
In Sri Lanka most of the Veterinary clinics have facilities to diagnose Leptospirosis. Urine and blood cultures will also be used for examining the prevalence of the bacteria.
Treatment
There is no complete cure for the disease when the animal gets the disease. The supportive treatment such as fluid therapy, support for the affected organs, calm and quiet environment will help. Also it is advised to keep the dog in ICU under strict veterinary supervision.
Prevention of the disease
Vaccination is the prevention method practiced in Sri Lanka. The vaccine is a triple vaccine called as DHL where the “L” stands for Canine Leptospirosis. The vaccine should be given to all pet dogs as an initial vaccine, booster vaccine and annual vaccine. The vaccine present in Sri Lanka is against L. canicola. Strict kennel sanitation, rodent control, and strict isolation of infected animals are all appropriate to decrease exposure to and the spread of Leptospirosis
Vaccine schedule in Sri Lanka
The 1st vaccine for pet dogs is given at the age of 8 weeks and booster vaccine is at the age of 3 months. Thereafter annual vaccination is needed.
Handling Leptospirosis affected dogs
As all body systems damaged and the disease is fatal you should give maximum comfort to your animal.
Prevention of human infection
First and utmost important precautionary measure is the timely vaccination of your pet dog. Also protect your dog at young stage until the booster vaccine is given to maximize the immunity. You should not share the chairs, beds with your pet dogs. While cleaning the kennel you should wear protective gears. In order to minimize the human infection protective latex gloves must be worn at all times, and all body fluids will be treated as a biologically hazardous material. Urine, semen, post-abortion discharge, vomit, and any fluid that leaves the body will need to be handled with extreme caution.
