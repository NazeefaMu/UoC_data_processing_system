CIM Sri Lanka hosts inaugural Principals Forum on ‘The New Age Education’

Understanding the pivotal role school Principals play as decision makers in schools, the Chartered Institute of Marketing (CIM) Sri Lanka recently hosted its inaugural Principals’ Forum under the theme ‘The New Age Education’ in December at the Hilton Colombo Residences.
The forum provided a vibrant platform for Principals from leading National, International and Private Schools in Sri Lanka to congregate and share their experiences, ideas and gain positive insights on a wide range of topics related to school education.
The esteemed gathering was addressed by leading distinguished speakers associated with cutting-edge educational perspectives.
The speakers enlightened the participants on several timely topics with the importance of being responsive to the enormous challenges faced by schools due to an increasingly complex society and a rapidly changing technology-based education system.
The discussions also focused on child and adolescent development and how to support growth in various domains including the cognitive, social, physical, and emotional.
Dr. Udena Attygala, Consultant Child and Adolescent Psychiatrist, Teaching Hospital Karapitiya, Galle responded to questions put forward by participating Principals on the topic of ‘Emotional intelligence and the role it plays in the various stages of a child’s development processes’.
He said, “There are various means of development - cognitive and physical development, and social development. Emotional intelligence is the ability to recognize, understand emotions and regulate those emotions and express them in a productive way, to be able to handle emotions.
Children and sometimes even adults also struggle with emotions. In emotional intelligence there is a component of being able to adapt, use their emotions so they can create a positive outcome.”
Elaborating from a corporate perspective, Damitha Dharmasena, Group Director HR, MAS Active noted the importance of preparing students for the future. He urged participants to inculcate a work ethos in students.
“What students go through during their younger days has a lasting influence as they enter into adult life, in terms of how they think, behave and their emotions”.
Prof. Ajantha Dharmasiri, Director and the Chairman of the Board of Management of the Postgraduate Institute of Management (PIM), University of Sri Jayewardenepura, Sri Lanka addressed the participants on the components of leadership.
He said, “A Leader has to be a servant; leadership is an opportunity to serve. Leadership is nothing to do with going on others shoulders, it is to do with carrying others on your shoulders.”
Elaborating on other significant traits of a leader he noted, “You need to be a collective decision maker, participate with problem solving.
It’s all about character and how you get connected to others through your emotional caring nature and about being logical and analytical, ability in being focused and taking action.”
Commenting on the initiative, Onalie Dissanayake, Educational Services Manager, CIM Sri Lanka stated that,“it’s an opportune moment to discusstopics of this nature as it could help the primary decision makers in schools to adapt to the trends in new age education. We hope to continue this initiative and constantly support schools in fulfilling the educational aspirations of the society”.
