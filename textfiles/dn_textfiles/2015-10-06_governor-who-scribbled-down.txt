GOVERNOR TALES:
The Governor who scribbled down

According to author Arjuna Hulugalle, Hugh Clifford was governor of Ceylon 1925—1927.
Hugh Clifford‘s tenure of office as secretary to the governor, was even more successful than the latter. In the thirteen years interspersing the two posts, he served in many parts in the British Empire that kept on expanding at a stupendous rate.
According to his bio data, Hugh born in London in March 1866 belonged to a Roman Catholic family. His pedigree was very high, with his grandfather extolling it as the 7th baron of the line. . Once qualified in the military line at Sandhurst ., he found his niche in Pahang of Malaysian terrain, as GA finally peaking to the post of British resident, Pahang. Incidentally after Chalmers he was the second British governor here, to have his son sacrificed to the raging gun fires of the First World War.
The Federated Malay States came to fruition at the time Clifford ruled there despite a spate of rebellions against the foreigner. Clifford quelled these rebellions easily. These facts transpire a shared history between the two countries, though the rebels got active in Malay lands later than in Lanka. Clifford then went on to Trinidad and Tobago.
During sir Clifford’s tenure as colonial secretary of Ceylon, before coming here as governor, he is said to have dazzled , but the dazzle was staged among those inclined towards imperialism , for he stood by the thinking that those Ceylonese who clamoured for self –govt. and route to independence were not at all representative of the average citizen but were a product of British rule , anglophiles as they were. The unofficial members of the legislative council became the butt of his attacks, especially their leader, Ponnambalam Ramanathan.
Hugh Clifford was a writer too and relished the company of writers like Leonard Woolf, in whose memoirs , Clifford appears often in the company of strange characters as Euro empresses. Such writers take us back to strange days in colonial Ceylon, when an acting governor lodged often at the king’s pavilion in Kandy. . Clifford before he became governor had acted in Acting Capacity for governor making a bee line to Kandy whenever he desired it. Anyway with his appointment to Gold Coast as governor these trips ceased somewhat.
In 1925 he was appointed as permanent governor of Ceylon, but what he had opposed at the time he was colonial secretary had materialized . The governor’s control of the legislature had ceased to exist. However the Donoughmore commission was by now knocking at the door and sir Clifford had to attune himself to the new developments ,largely aimed at making the colony more educated politically and otherwise. . With his former partiality to Kandy he advocated the university as in or near Kandy , engendering many an opponent who wanted everything worthwhile to be Colombo centred.
Come here as a widower, the governor married again, this time to a novelist and playwright. Clifford himself was a writer of renown but he does not seem to have written a book on Ceylon. Favourite topic has been Malaya as the following names of these books reveal.
Studies in Brown Humanity
Bush whacking
Malayan monochromes
It is a wonder he never wrote any literature on Kandy, at least on the short Empress who had come to have a peep at Buddha’s tooth relic escorted by the six footed handsome governor himself who critics often describe as a lady’s man !
Married twice, second time to a famed novelist and playwright back home, named Rosabelle , he died in 1941 aged 75 years.
