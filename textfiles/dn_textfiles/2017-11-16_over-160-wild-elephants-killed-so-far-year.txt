Over 160 wild elephants killed so far this year

Over 160 wild elephants have died by electrocution, being knocked down by passenger trains, being shot and being caught in traps, during past ten months of this year.
The recent surveys conducted by the government have proved that these wild elephants have died in the Kurunegala, Polonnaruwa, Ampara, Anuradapura and Trincomalee districts within the wildlife zones of the Mahaweli, Northen, Western and Eastern regions.
S. M. Premaratne of the Kurunegala District Small Farmers’ Association revealed these facts speaking at a meeting of farmers of the Kurunegala district over the hardships and nuisances caused by wild jumbos towards paddy and chena cultivations of the North Western Province (NWP), held at the Youth Training Centre in Bingiriya, Kurunegala, on Monday.
He said the farmer community should extend their fullest support to the Ministry of Wildlife Conservation to protect the vanishing wild elephant population of Sri Lanka as elephants of our country are our pride and a cultural heritage of our motherland. He added that a sum of Rs. 34 million would be spent this year by the government for erecting electric fences to prevent wild elephants from entering inhabited villages and cultivated lands during night hours.
