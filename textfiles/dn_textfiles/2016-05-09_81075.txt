Giving electronic media the power with responsibility

A recent news item revealed that the Government is considering the establishment of an independent authority to regulate electronic media in the near future. A government official, commenting on the matter, stated that this authority will be established with the consent of all industry stakeholders.
Our Constitution provides for freedom of speech and expression, including for members of the media, and the government generally respected these rights. Today, our print media are self-regulated. The Internet has also gone unregulated, despite concerns about some controversial content. Electronic media, which mainly consist of radio and television broadcasters must obtain a license from the government because, according to our law, the public owns the airwaves. Other than that, they are also expected to regulate themselves.
Self-regulation in the press mainly takes the form of journalistic codes of practice for accuracy and fairness plus some procedures for implementation. Self-regulation also tends to deal with privacy issues, the protection of journalistic sources and standards in advertising.
The means of accountability are typically voluntary and non-punitive. They are 'policed’ either within and by the media organization itself or by some intermediate body representing public and industry interests.
The need
Given such a scenario, one might ask whether we really need a mechanism to regulate electronic media. Few questions have to be answered and sorted out first before we find out the answer.
According to some research sources, the key reason behind bringing an independent regulatory mechanism for electronic media derives from the claims made against them by the public and other critics on grounds of failing to meet expectations of the public and also actually causing various kinds of harm to the society. These claims are usually resisted by a section of electronic media because they interfere with their own claims to free expression and their commercial objectives.
At this point, it may be feasible for us to identify what exactly common citizens expect from the electronic media. In the opinion of the writer, the main issues of primarily public concern are, (1) maintaining respect for public values in matters of taste and decency, (2) achieving benefits for the public sphere in terms of balanced information flow, access, diversity and public participation, (3) maintaining cultural standards and supporting the national or regional culture and language, (4) respecting human rights of expression and protection from insult and prejudice, (5) preventing harm to society, especially by way of harm to children and young people from undesirable content.
Have the Sri Lankan electronic media managed to meet these aspirations during the past few decades It’s doubtful whether they did. This observation is not exclusive to Sri Lanka but prevails in many countries, even in the developed world.
Regulation
That is why, radio and television broadcasting are subject to certain levels of regulation, in over 150 countries, both developing and developed, have some type of electronic media regulatory mechanisms. In those countries, the general concept of social responsibility and public interest lies at the core of the broadcasting model, although there are several variants, such as weaker (as in the USA) or stronger forms (as in Europe).
The electronic media model covers two main types of system. One is the public service variant, the other consists of privately owned. In a fully developed form, public service broadcasting generally refers to five main features, which are supported by policy and regulation. One is the provision of a full service to all. A second is that the system should be financed by payments from all citizens or, as in the UK, all receiving households (not just the consumers of the service). Thirdly, there is public control of access to broadcasting channels, in greater or less detail, to ensure “fairness”, political neutrality, and independence from vested interests and from the state.
Fourthly, a public broadcasting service is democratically accountable to the nation. This is usually achieved by way of parliamentary control of financial allocations. Fifthly, a public broadcasting service seeks to achieve various goals of quality of service. The regulation of public broadcasting makes it accountable to the public and to society rather than to owners, or the market.
Privately owned commercial broadcasting systems, in contrast, are free to choose their own objectives, in the sense of whichever consumer audience or advertising market they want to serve. However, they are subject to licensing conditions and public scrutiny. Their primary accountability is to owners, investors and clients. Regulation in this case is essentially restrictive and is designed to establish the ground rules and set limits within which the systems operate. These ground rules mainly concern the matters such as: permitted amount and content of advertising; control of other means of finance (e.g. sponsorship); content potentially harmful to the young or causing offence to some value or group (e.g. in matters of racism, or religious blasphemy); procedures for complaints and rights of reply.
Privately owned commercial broadcasting systems often have to meet certain minimum standards as a condition of receiving a license or operating concession. These conditions often relate to such matters as provision for education, news and information, local language or culture, political or other access opportunities, minority needs.
Forms of regulation
In many developed countries, the forms of regulation are diverse, but there is a certain standard pattern. Such laws state broadly the goals of the system and who or what bodies are eligible to operate as broadcasters and under what conditions. For instance, some countries forbid or limit foreign ownership and, many have rules forbidding cross-ownership between press and broadcasting. In some European countries political or religious organizations are not allowed to own and operate broadcasting stations.
More detailed terms and conditions may also be set down in license and franchise agreements, which will be periodically renewed, revised and, if necessary, can be revoked. Broadcasting laws often contain content-related regulations, for instance requiring a balance between different kinds of content (especially information and entertainment) or requiring a certain amount of home production or transmission in the national language.
Laws of this kind are the province of parliaments. There will often be a Ministry or other Department of government which has the responsibility for their formulation - for example, the Department for Culture, Media and Sport (in Britain), or the Ministry of Communications (in France).
However, there is usually another thick layer of administrative machinery between government and the actual broadcasting organizations which can serve as a two-way link and, in certain cases, help to preserve the independence of broadcasting from direct government interference. This link is increasingly formed by powerful regulatory agencies which have an oversight over different media organisations. In Britain, for instance, we find the Office of Communications (Ofcom), in France the ConseilSuperieur de l'Audiovisuel (CSA), in Sweden the Broadcasting Commission, in Holland the Commissariat for the Media, in the USA the Federal Communication Commission (FCC).
There may also be a few additional bodies (both statutory and voluntary) that represent the interests of viewers and listeners, whether as consumers or citizens and keep up pressure for enforcement of rules and for expressing complaints.
Tiered and platform-specific
This writer believes that the need of the hour is to create a robust regulatory mechanism for electronic media that is two-tiered and platform-specific. The first tier should be within the media organisations -an ombudsman type to be appointed by the Government. This will give a chance for a listener or a viewer to get relief and recompense without going through the time and resource consuming legal path.
Tier two should be at the national level and be an independent regulatory authority that takes an active role in promoting high standards, including having the power to investigate serious breaches and slap sanctions. It should have a legal underpinning to make it binding.
The authority should come out with clear implementable and binding codes that provide an effective complaint redress mechanism and its enforcement. The first tier of regulations should focus on course correction rather than being punitive in its approach. There should also be space for arbitration to resolve most of the issues. The idea of arbitration is to make the redress system accessible to the general public both in terms of costs and time. The legal recourse, in the event of unsatisfactory outcome during the arbitration, should be at the level of the High Court.
The regulatory body should also be backed by systems designed to assess whether it is doing its job properly. Finally the authority must attempt an effective method to incorporate suggestions from different quarters and disciplines in order to come up with a set of rules that do not prioritise one element of freedom at the cost of others.
