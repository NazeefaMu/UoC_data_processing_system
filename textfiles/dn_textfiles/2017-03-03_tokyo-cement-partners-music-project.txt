Tokyo Cement partners The Music Project

Tokyo Cement has partnered with The Music Project, a non-profit initiative dedicated to empowering and uplifting the lives of children through music.
The partnership will see Tokyo Cement sponsoring three schools; two in Mullaitivu and another from Mawathagama, Kurunegala, to further their music education.
Nearly 140 students from Yohapuram MV and Therankandal MV of Mullaitivu, and 50 students from Gunananda MV of Kurunegala will benefit from this collaboration that will enhance their music education during the year 2017.
Speaking on the occasion of forming the funding partnership, S.R. Gnanam, Managing Director of Tokyo Cement Company (Lanka) PLC said, “The Music Project aims to unite communities through children who love to learn music. By working with farming communities in the North and South of Sri Lanka who come from similar backgrounds, the project links these families who unanimously want to create better opportunities for their children, regardless of their race or religion.”
At Therankandal MV in Mallavi, Mullaitivu currently 40 students practice during sessions conducted every Friday before the commencement of school. The heart-warming sight of young children accompanied by their parents from various walks of life, bustling to take their seats inside the meagre common room early morning is encouragement enough for the young teachers and volunteer instructors conducting the program.
“The Music Project, inspired by El Sisitema of Venezuela, aims to create opportunities for children to learn music through holistic teaching methods. We hope that the programme is a stepping stone for the children to be able to make choices or simply avail of a passion,” said Shalini Wickramasuriya, Trustee of The Music Project commenting on the benefits of the initiative.
Tokyo Cement comes forward as a sponsor this year, owing to their belief in building the foundation for tomorrow’s leaders through programs such as this that encourage children to explore the world using exciting new tools and not be limited by standardised education. Tokyo Cement has successfully integrated social welfare and environmental conservation into its corporate DNA and is on a continuous mission to enrich the country, its people and the environment.
