Former SLPA Chairman’s case trial on February 1

A case filed against former Sri Lanka Ports Authority (SLPA) Chairman Priyath Bandu Wickrama and two others was fixed for further trial on February 1 by the Colombo Additional Magistrate Priyantha Liyanage.
The Additional Magistrate made this order due to the absence of Colombo Chief Magistrate Ranga Dissanayake.
They are charged for allegedly causing a Rs.65 million loss to the government by employing 319 employees of the Ports Authority for election work during the 2015 Presidential Election.
The Commission to Investigate Allegations of Bribery or Corruption Director General filed this case against the former Ports Authority Chairman Priyath Bandu Wickrama, R.B.Sanjaya Kumara and Nihal Keppetipola under Section 70 of the Bribery Act on three charges.
The Bribery Commission alleged that the first accused Priyath Bandu Wickrama had unlawfully employed 319 employees for election work on or around October 20, 2014 to January 7, 2015, while he was serving as the Ports Authority Chairman.
