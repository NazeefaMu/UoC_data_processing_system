East school resource development expedited

Rural development activities are expedited in the Divisional Secretariat Division of Eastern Province. The physical resource development activities of schools have been given priority, Eastern Province Health, Indigenous Medicine, Social Services, Probation Child Care and Rural Electrification Minister A.L.M.Naseer said.
School Principals should take utmost care regarding the development of schools and curricular activities, he said.
The Provincial Minister was addressing a meeting of the development of Addalaichenai Al – Muneera Ladies High School at the school premises, recently.
The Addalaichenai Jummah Grand Mosque donated a plot of land to the Addalaichenai Al-Muneera Girls’ High School for its extension and development.
The land deed was handed over to the school principal M.H.M.Razmy and SDC Secretary A.B.Abdul Gaffoor by the Mosque President and Senior Lecturer of the South Eastern University of Sri Lanka A.L.Hanees and Trustee Board Senior Member A.B.M.A.Cader on the occasion.
The meeting was presided by school principal M.H.M.Razmy. Eastern Provincial Council Opposition Leader M.S.Udumalebbe, Akkaraipattu Zonal Education Director A.L.M.Cassim, Addalaichenai Divisional Education Officer M.A.C.Gassaly, Coordinating Secretary to the EP Chief Minister S.L.M.Faleel, Senior Lawyer S.M.A.Gaffoor, School Development Committee Secretary A.B.Abdul Gaffoor, School Management Board officials and Members of Board of Trustee participated.
Naseer said the principal and teaching staff of the schools may belong to different political parties, but they should not show any difference to their students. Otherwise, it will bring about the break – down of schools particularly in administration and academic activities, he said.
“We are allocating sufficient funds for the development of schools considering the urgent needs.
They include the reconstruction of old buildings, putting up school name boards, access gates, protective fences, construction of children’s activity rooms, children’s playground, doors and windows repairing, painting, pavement reconstruction and landscaping.
“We are politicians and we are not against educational programmes and development of schools,” he added.
He said the Akkaraipattu Zonal Education office is contributing largely towards the education development of the division which should be appreciated by everyone in this village.
