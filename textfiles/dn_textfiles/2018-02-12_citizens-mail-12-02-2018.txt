[CITIZENS' Mail - (12-02-2018)]

A great loss to the country
The passing away of the Most Ven. Bellanwila WImalarathana Nayake Thera is an irreparable loss to the country.
The Most Ven. Thera was a brilliant scholar and a highly respected Buddhist monk.
This noble Thera was a prolific writer who gained fame as a promoter of Buddhism not only in Sri Lanka but Carlson in UK, USA, Japan, Nepal, Myanmar, Thailand and Bhutan.
The Most Ven. Thera gave leadership and guidance to the multitude of activities of the temple.
The Venerable Thera had both traditional monastic learning and modern university education. He did a lot of social service work. He was a great teacher who has done a lot of academic research activities.
The Ven. Thera turned the monastery into a social service centre.
The Most Ven. Bellanwila Wimalarathana Nayake Thera retained his independence by not going after those in power to receive undue favours.
May the Nayake Thera attain the supreme bliss of nibbana.
D. Weeratunga
