Quest for excellence

Choreographer Janadhari Salgado brings a ground-shaking intensity to the odyssey of Sri Lankan dance through her academy Jayamini Janaranga Kala Nikethanaya. A lot of backstories has brought Salgado to this juncture, fragments of which she and her collaborators intermittently reveal. There are stories from the slow, steady and patient expedition.
Those fragments can be hard to piece together. Her academic credentials (Diploma in Dance Choreography from Sri Lanka Training Foundation, First Class Honours in Bharatha Natyam (Bhathkanda) from an Aesthetic Indian University, Bharatha, Kathak, Kathakali and Manipuri as Higher qualifications from Sri Lanka Forum of Dancing) speak a lot for her forbearance in the mushrooming unqualified fellowship.
Q: You are a much sought after dance teacher. What is your secret formula?
A: My childhood was spent with my mother’s sister Padmini Dahanayake and uncle Moris Dahanayake. My aunt was a Bharatha Natyam Dancer. She was the first Sri Lankan Bharatha Natyam Dancer who received a diploma. I used to observe her throughout the day as she practised. I joined her too. She willingly trained me in the Bharatha Natyam steps. These steps are so hard even for an adult. But my little feet grasped the rhythm. At eight, I could well manage the difficult poses like my aunt.
Q: How did you fare at school?
A: First I was admitted to Our Lady of Victories, Moratuwa. I kept my dancing ability as a secret there. Then I went to Princess of Wales. Like OLV they did not offer Buddhism as a subject. The Dancing teacher, Nelum Mendis, sensed my ability, though I selected oriental music under Aesthetic Studies. I just took part in all dancing concerts on stage. There onwards, whether it was eastern or western, the teachers used to comment on my features. I was selected to perform as well as sing. If that huge stage could speak it would say how it felt my little feet quite often. I could act too. When Dhamma Jagoda and Tissa Gunawardena were in the panel, I was chosen as the best actress of a competition.
Q: Most dancers tend to do away with academic credentials. But you have chosen the alternative path ?
A: I studied oriental dancing at the University of Kelaniya. Now I am reading for the PhD. It will be over most probably by the end of this year. I am patient. It offers such a mental relief. The university experience is unique. I remember most undergraduates used to quit the practical lessons. Our batch was 40, but sometimes only three students stayed for the practical sessions. But I had a deep down feeling that I should not follow their path.
Q: There are many dancing academies across the country. How do you assess your own academy?
A: We protect. I nurture my students with full might and ambition. Maybe we will have to close down this academy in a few years when my students become veterans in the field and no longer need any coaching. Once they become veterans they open their own academies. And they do well. I will tolerate that competition with a smile. I can actually be happy because they grew up in my shelter.
On the other hand, I never entrust the job of teaching to other instructors. However painful or however tired I am, I would still take pains to train them. I have been the only teacher in my academy for the last 20 years.
I teach them various elements separately. Singing, making notations and stage makeup, all that for a few rupees.
Q: What can dancing do to the humankind?
A: Unless it is a serious performance before a general public, I dare not become a media bug. The doors of my dance academy are close to media, especially the television channels. My students learn the value of life quality. They imbibe in the team spirit. They respect each other. My students are not into cruelty. I teach them discipline.
The patience makes them master the dance. I also teach time management. They must leave the stage on time. As for your question, I think any aesthetic art enhances the brain cells. Art balances a person’s lifestyle.
