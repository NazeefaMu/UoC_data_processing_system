Trump promises a ‘real book’ on his White House

US: US President Donald Trump says that he will write a “real book” about his time in the White House, as he continued to seek to discredit other efforts to chronicle his chaotic tenure.
In a morning tweet, Trump levelled his latest criticism against a forthcoming book by veteran journalist Bob Woodward, calling it “just another assault against me, in a barrage of assaults” and branding it “fiction.”
Woodward has said he stands by the reporting in his book, which offers a harrowing portrayal of Trump’s tenure, with aides seeking to curb his worst impulses, and Trump denigrating some of those who work around him, including Attorney General Jeff Sessions.
“Dems can’t stand losing. I’ll write the real book!” Trump said in his tweet.
During his business career, Trump wrote nearly 20 books, including “The Art of the Deal.” Most of the books had ghost writers. During the 2016 Republican primaries, Trump also released a book titled, “Crippled America: How to Make America Great Again.”
In recent days, Trump has accused Woodward of making up quotes and mused about changing US libel laws in an effort to better position himself to seek “retribution.”
As part Trump’s efforts to discredit Woodward on Monday, he wrote another tweet in which he quoted Washington Examiner reporter Katelyn Caralle as saying, “You cannot take this book too seriously.” Caralle’s Examiner biography notes that she first came to Washington as an intern for the conservative Heritage Foundation in 2016.
In other tweets Monday morning, Trump claimed that the White House, which has experienced significant staff turnover and other tumult, is a “smooth running machine” and touted economic figures under his leadership. - stuff.co.nz
