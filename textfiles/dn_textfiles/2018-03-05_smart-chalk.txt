Smart chalk

For many children who study in 65 schools across Sri Lanka, school life has become a digital adventure! Taxila Central College Horana and Dhammananda Maha Vidyalaya Moronthuduwa are using this technology and it has proved to be extremely successful. This vastly superior technology has revolutionized education in these schools and it is very likely that other schools in our island will follow suit.
Gone are the days of blackboards and chalk! They have been replaced by an interactive computer screen. Yes school life for them will never be the same again! It has become enjoyable, interesting and interactive. In fact, the future is already here in Sri Lanka. This is what is known as the Smart School Project.

A total of 97,500 students between Grades 6 – 13 currently benefit from the smart school project.
It is widely known that Commercial Bank has undertaken many CSR projects throughout Sri Lanka. Under its IT education program, Commercial Bank has donated computers, printers, furniture and other IT equipment to set up IT labs in 175 schools across Sri Lanka. These IT labs currently benefit more than 160,000 students, most of them from rural areas.
The smart schools project is its latest initiative. It is a collaboration of Headstart (Pvt) Ltd, Commercial Bank, Microsoft Sri Lanka and Dialog Axiata under the supervision of the Department of Education of the Western Province. The goal is to complete the transformation of 65 schools for digital learning.
Daily News was taken on a Media Tour by Commercial Bank and experienced firsthand how this education system is changing lives. The learning is taken place by teachers trained to use this technology.
Currently, there are 65 schools that are digital learning enabled. Each school has approximately 1500 students and employs teachers who are trained to digitally impart the curriculum and facilitate digital learning. Currently, there are 6,500 trained teachers spread across the 65 schools from the Western Province, with the ability to guide digitized learning.
Physics Teacher of Taxila Central College Horana, Deepika Karunarathna, said that from the 65 schools chosen from the Western Province, 25 were provided Learning Management Systems free of charge by Headstart.
“This learning management system really is beneficial to the student, in the sense that it helps the child adapt to this new system of learning. The child is able to absorb and take in the information. It allows us to evaluate the progress of the child and the child also is able to gauge his or her standard. It really makes learning a lot easier for the child.
Another feature of this learning method is the child himself or herself is able to prepare presentations. This is because the child has been able to familiarize himself or herself with these technological advancements. With this, the child can be proud that he or she has been able to do so independently. In a way the child becomes more knowledgeable than the teacher,” said Karunarathna. Karunarathna also mentioned that a select group of schools were taken to Malaysia on a tour for four days for the BETT Asia Summit.
“At the conference, we were lectured, but there was nothing new for us to learn, as Headstart had already taught us everything there was to know. Because of our knowledge, I must say that we were envied, and all who came into contact with us were amazed by our knowledge. I must say that some of the representatives from other countries were not as knowledgeable as us. This is why we are indebted to Headstart for all the help they have given us. I must say that the students and teachers have been greatly benefited, as I myself did not know how to create a Gmail account when I first started using this technology,” said Karunarathna.
Karunarathna also stated that with the advancements in the world, it is vital that rural schools keep up with the changing world and technology.
Principal A Y P Perera pointed out that what she sees as a plus point is the child’s attitude towards this form of learning and their understanding of the importance of learning.
“They really enjoy this form of learning and you can see that when you guide them. It is fun to learn and it is a pleasure to use such interactive technology. It is almost like watching television. Even I genuinely love it. However to get maximum use of this form of learning you need the facilities. Even I am amazed at how user-friendly it is. Even at their homes, these students do not possess computers, so it is only at school that they come into contact with this technology. So we are thankful to Commercial Bank and the other partners. We are a rural school and we are so fortunate that we have been gifted this technology,” said Perera.
* Responsibilities of Smart school principals include guiding and supporting e-learning teacher ambassadors and learning communities through training, monitoring the progress of the school, motivating and enabling all parties involved to work with technology and to finally ensure the expected transformation occurs in the school.
* Responsibilities of ambassador teachers include distributing knowledge gained from training among other teachers and students, encouraging teachers to develop their own e-learning material and to be innovative with new education solutions.
