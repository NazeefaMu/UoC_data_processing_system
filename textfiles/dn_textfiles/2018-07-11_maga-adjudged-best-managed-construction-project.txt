National Project Management Excellence Awards 2018
Maga adjudged Best Managed Construction Project

Maga Engineering emerged the category winner under Best Managed Project in Construction/Infrastructure Development Sector for the construction of 47-storey Clearpoint Residencies at the recently concluded National Project Management Excellence Awards 2018.
This award ceremony, organized by the Project Management Institute Sri Lanka Chapter was held for the second time in Sri Lanka to recognize complex projects that best deliver superior performance of project management practices, superior organizational results and positive impacts on the society.
At the same time, the award scheme recognizes project outcome, technologies, innovative functions and Sri Lankan content in the project prioritizing the value delivered by the project to its clients.
Known as the ‘tallest vertical garden in the world’, Clearpoint Residences is a joint venture between Milroy Perera Associates and Maga Engineering. A brainchild of renowned architect, Milroy Perera, the residential apartment tower is a holistic green building which accommodates 171 apartments across 47 floors.
The planted terraces offer the building a unique character while providing many benefits: Formation of a green cover provides a natural cooling system for the entire building, resulting not only in a fresher, more relaxing atmosphere, but also less energy consumption on air-conditioning.
This blanket of trees endows the building with an innate soundproofing system. It also provides shade and buffer radiant heat. Clearpoint is also the first high-rise building in Sri Lanka to contain fully-fledged rainwater harvesting, automated drip irrigation, grey water recycling and solid waste disposal systems, as well as solar panels that can power all its common areas.
Commenting on the award, Director Engineering of Maga Engineering and Project Director, Asoka de Silva said, “An exciting project from inception, Clearpoint offered us many unique design and construction challenges along the way. Some of these included the construction of cantilevered terraces on every floor, cantilevered private swimming pools on select floors, planting of endemic trees on terraces and the construction of a curved solar panel assembly on the rooftop. Our clear vision at the commencement of project and commitment from the project execution team, made this vision a reality and enabled us to complete the project on schedule and with budget. Designed and built by an entirely Sri Lankan group of professionals, the project is a testimony to the engineering and construction expertise held within the local construction industry.’’
Assistant General Manager and Project Manager, Saman Mahawatta said “Considering the nature and scale of this unique project, meticulous planning of all salient aspects of project management, covering quality, cost, time, safety and environment was carried out. This enabled us to anticipate the complex construction and operational challenges in advance, eventually resulting in the project’s timely completion and handover. Another the key challenge was to train, retain and manage the large workforce nearing 1000 to ensure smooth operations of work throughout the project. I convey my gratitude to the dedicated project team for the successful completion of this landmark building.”
This award also endorses Maga’s investments in leading the cause of promoting green buildings in Sri Lanka as the leader in the construction sector of the country.
The company remains focused on service and product excellence and is committed to its vision of creating lasting socio-economic value for all stakeholders.
