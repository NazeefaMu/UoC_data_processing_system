President clears the air

President Maithripala Sirisena has reiterated that attempts to form a government by manipulating numbers in parliament was but a pipe dream lived in by those currently out of power and that he, and he alone, would be the final arbiter as to who forms a government. The President was responding to a remark make by a former minister and another Joint Opposition stalwart that the unity government and the President himself will soon be history after they win over 113 members in parliament to form a government. The President's statement also comes in the wake of reports that 18 members of SLFP, which is part of the unity government, are to part ways and sit as Independents in parliament, thus shaking the government's two thirds majority in the House. Responding to this, SLFP General Secretary Minister Duminda Dissanayake said that disciplinary action would be taken by the party Central Committee, in the event of this happening, which, in all probability, would see the rebels being ousted from parliament.
Be that as it may, the President's statement was based on sound logic. To begin with, the UNP which is all for the continuation of the unity government is the party with the largest number of members (106) in parliament, though falling short of the magical 113 required for a simple majority. The Joint Opposition which is hoping to oust the government via the numbers game commands a mere 51 members (with two members on the fence). Even assuming that the 18 SLFP MPs quit the government and align themselves with the JO this hardly is going to shake the government's majority in parliament, although it may affect the two thirds majority. As the President has noted, it is he, and he alone, who is vested with the constitutional powers to decide which party rules. With the UNP commanding the majority in parliament and many SLFP stalwarts holding important ministerial posts, for all intents and purposes, the unity government is set for the long haul.
We say this because CBK had only a one member majority in parliament when she won in 1994 although she received support from outside the People's Alliance to cobble together a simple majority. The situation was the same after the PA won the 2000 General election as well and she went on to govern for two full terms commanding only a simple majority in parliament barring the 2001-2004 interregnum. Of course, she tried to engineer a two thirds majority by ‘buying over’ UNPers to get her new constitution passed, an exercise which however came a cropper.
Such a scenario certainly does not obtain in the current parliament, with a combined UNP-SLFP government in place, and over three dozen SLFP MPs well ensconced as ministers, deputy or state ministers, rendering any attempts by the JO to arrive at the 113 mark a dashed long shot. A dissolution of parliament too is out of the question given the constitutional bar placed on the President that permits him to dissolve parliament only after the expiry of four and a half years of its current term, dashing any hopes of the JO to go for an early election.
Therefore, those of the SLFP planning to defect are bound to be stranded in no man’s land. They will have to vegetate as Independent members in parliament (if that be their true intention) for another full three years when elections are due. Even then, providing they get nominations from the party under which the JO will contest, their success is very much in doubt after having already consorted with the ‘enemy’ and enjoyed ministerial office under a UNP led unity government.
This is of course assuming that they will survive an expulsion from parliament prior to that. But with Sarath Silva taken out of the equation there is no guarantee that the rebels will remain long enough in parliament to face another election. One recalls how four UNP stalwarts decamped on the eve of 1999 Presidential Election to throw in their lot with CBK. The stand taken by the foursome was that they were still members of the Grand Old Party and joined the other side to support the programmes of the President. Attempts to get them expelled from the party and therefore parliament by the UNP failed due to the Sarath Silva led Supreme Court holding with the renegades.
One fails to see a reenactment of such a scenario now, when the SLFP leader is President Sirisena. It is equally doubtful if the present Supreme Court will take a similar view of things.
A courageous call
The call by TNA and Opposition Leader R. Sampanthan for the arrest and imprisonment of unlawful elements in the North is to be commended in the context of criticism leveled against him for pursuing only a single issue agenda, namely federalism and for not performing the duties of a true Opposition leader that should encompass the entire country. It would have taken a lot of political courage for Sampanthan to make that call, given that it was made to the Sri Lanka Police, read Sinhala Police.
