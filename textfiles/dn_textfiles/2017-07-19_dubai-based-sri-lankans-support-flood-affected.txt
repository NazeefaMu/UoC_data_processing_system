Dubai-based Sri Lankans support flood affected

The Sri Lankan expatriate community in Dubai and the Northern Emirates and other well wishers donated AED 58,150 (Approximately SL Rs. 2,500,000) and four consignments of essential items to Sri Lanka for the people affected by the floods in May.
This initiative was mooted after a meeting convened in the Consulate General of Sri Lanka on June 1 with the presence of the representatives of the Sri Lankan Associations to streamline the donations routed to Sri Lanka in the aftermath of the floods in line with the requirements of the Government.
Oover 30 Sri Lankan formal and informal associations in Dubai and the Northern Emirates supported the distressed Sri Lankan citizens under the guidance of the Consulate General of Sri Lanka in Dubai and the Northern Emirates. The associations have divided the workload during the meeting convened in the Consulate to avoid duplication of collecting essential items and to determine the most needed items at the time of disaster.
The Sri Lankan community was able to deliver four consignments including a consignment of bedsheets and bath towels, a consignment of 866 nos of tarpaulin sheets weighing 2,838 kg each worth of AED 30 at the total cost of AED 26,000 (Approximately SL Rs. 1,118,000) and a consignment of 95 nos of tents each worth AED 500 at the total cost of AED 45,000 (Approximately SL Rs. 1,935,000) and a consignment of Sanitary pads, baby diapers and canned fish, much needed at the time of disaster.
The Marks and Spencer/Al Futtaim- Dubai offered over 9,000 pieces of clothes weighing over 4,300 kg and worth of AED 517,000 (Approximately SL Rs. 22,231,000 Sri) to be used by the flood victims.
The SriLankan, Emirates, and Flydubai Airlines and their management in Dubai assisted the Consulate General to air cargo the collected items from the Sri Lankan Community to the Disaster Management Ministry at the earliest free of charge and the Middle East based Sri Lankan company Frico International LLC assisted in packing and freight forwarding the items free of charge to Sri Lanka.
The Consulate General of Sri Lanka in Dubai and the Northern Emirates wishes to convey its appreciation and gratitude to all Sri Lankan Associations, individual donors, well wishers in Dubai and the Northern Emirates for gathering together as one nation to help the fellow Sri Lankan citizens at the hour of need.
