Ravana no more in hibernation

According to historical sources, our motherland was much bigger 5000 years back. The major portion of it is now buried at sea and only one eighth of the land is visible as Sri Lanka.
Rajawaliya says, due to misdeed committed by Ravana, his entire empire was buried at sea.
Is Atlantis… another name for Ravana’s land which now is concealed under the seabed? Had the tectonic plates of the Earth’s surface shifted that land to a distant place of the globe over the centuries?
Is Ravana’s Dandu Monara aka Pushpaka Vimana still in existence and kept safely in an isolated place, here in our country?
Some historians say Ravana being a member of the Galactic Federation had ruled 10 worlds in our galaxy which are depicted by the ten heads of his. They also opine galactic federation is keeping Rawana’s hibernated body hid in a place until the right time for making his comeback.
‘Ra’ means the Sun and it is said, the Sun induced energy (solar energy) to Dandu Monara to be airborne. In an Indian annual festival, Ravana’s effigies are burned even now as he was Rama’s arch-rival.
Ramayanaya Nurthi
The Indian hermit Valmiki in 500 BC wrote the poetic tale of Ramayana even before Mahabharata was written.
This mind blowing story provided many insights to artistes, especially to dramatists and filmmakers world over. Sri Lankan attorney and playwright John de Silva wrote the script and made Ramayanaya Nurthi in 1933. Film director Manik Sadrasagara casted Gamini Fonseka as Ravana in his film Sita Devi that was made based on Ramayanaya. The song Nimhim Sewwa in the film sung by maestro Amaradewa became an evergreen one.
The visionary, Kalasuri Arisen Ahubudu made his own version of Ramayanaya play as Sakvithi Ravana decades back. Its hit song was Pombule Mage Pombule.
The original Ramayanaya Nurthi based on John de Silva’s play has been reproduced now. Branded yet again as Ramayanaya Nurthi it is directed and edited this time around by Kalabhushana Lionel Gunatilleke. The play focuses on school children and the general public as its target viewer segments.
Nimal Jayasinghe is the assistant director of the Ramayanaya Nurthi and it is presented by the Tower Hall Theatre Foundation.Ramayanaya Nurthi’s second performance in 2017 presented by the Tower Hall Theatre Foundation in association with the education ministry was staged on October 31 at the Tower Hall. The occasion was graced by Education Minister Akila Viraj Kariyawasam and former state minister of child affairs and deputy head of the Prime Minister’s office, Rosy Senanayake.
“Since Ramayanaya is in the school curriculum now, it is very important for parents to come with their children and watch this Nurthi. School Principals could contribute by staging the play for the benefit of school children”, says Kalabhushana Gunatilleke.
“The essence of Valmiki’s Ramayanaya is in my Nurthi. Pandit Vishvanath Lauji who was an Indian music maestro had made music scores for John de Silva’s Ramayanaya Nurthi and we went by those scores”, he added.Nurthi is a form of Art that has a blend of dancing, music and singing embedded in it along with enhanced gestures and facial expressions of the performers. The original Ramayanaya has 54 songs although the newest creation has 34 inclusive of the evergreen Nurthi song, Amba Damba Naaran. Another object of making the new Ramayanaya Nurthi has been to preserve the diminishing art of Nurthi for posterity.
Folklore says Ravana had exceptional powers that astounded people of this world. Though he abducted Sita, the lady of Rama, he never intended to make Sita lose her chastity.
“In different time circles there would have been people with exceptional powers who inhabited this world. They would have had the power to be airborne and to interact with beings from other worlds. Ravana represented that clan of exceptional individuals who ruled this world and beyond. The weapon called Rama Sara used by Ravana is similar to a missile used in modern warfare. Rama in desperation would have sought help from Gods to win his final battle with the mighty Ravana,” said Gunatilleke.
He added, “All these factors being food for thought, I decided to stick to the original story of late John de Silva’s play when making the Ramayanaya Nurthi, since the core object was to revive this original Nurthi after decades”.
Ranga Weerkoon (late Quintus Weerakoon’s son), Sanka Jayalath and Iwanka Peiris portray Rama, Ravana and Sita in the Ramayanaya Nurthi.
Tower Hall Theatre Foundation’s assistant director programs, Chandana Wijesundera Bandara said Ramayanaya Nurthi will be staged again in January 2018.
