Army supports UN Vesak Day splendour and national Vesak festival

Sri Lanka Army is throwing their full weight behind the successful conduct of the forthcoming UN recognized island-wide Vesak commemoration, themed ‘Buddha’s Teachings for Sustainable Global Peace’ and the National Vesak festival at State and Army levels.
Security Force Headquarters-West (SFHQ-West), Adjutant General Branch, Army Headquarters and the Army Buddhist Association under the close supervision of the Army Commander Lieutenant General Crisanthe De Silva, have undertaken to commemorate the phenomenal Thrice-Blessed Day by staging elaborate arrangements across the country with special focus on full-day ‘sil’ programmes, Vesak decoration zones, concerts of devotional songs (Bakthi Gee), free eateries (Dansal), special religious programmes, etc, Sri Lanka Army said in a release.
The 14th United Nations Vesak Day, as well as Sri Lanka’s National Vesak festival, take place in Sri Lanka this year on a grand scale under the guidance of the President, Prime Minister and the Ministry of Buddhist Affairs, mustering the support from all state and private sector agencies.
State-sponsored main ceremonies and international conferences have also been scheduled to coincide with this commemorative event at Kegalle, Wattarama Raja Maha Vihara premises and the Bandaranaike Memorial International Conference Hall (BMICH) with the participation of a record number of foreign delegates and government leaders. Of 85 countries, representatives of 73 countries have already confirmed their participation in the 14th UN Vesak Day celebration in Sri Lanka. It had been held 11 times in Thailand and twice in Vietnam before the UN offered the opportunity to Sri Lanka.
Symbolising the initial commencement of this year’s national Vesak celebrations (May 7 - 14) in the country, Minister of Buddha Sasana, on Friday, ceremonially opened the Army-built new preaching hall (Dharmashalawa) at Wattarama Raja Maha Viharaya along Kegalle-Polgahawela road. SFHQ-West troops, under the directions of SF-West Commander Major General Sudantha Ranasinghe, brought the construction project to a successful completion with the blessings of the Commander of the Army, the release added.
The Army-built Rs. 50 m worth new Wattarama preaching hall that could accommodate 2,000 devotees, sponsored by the Ministry of Buddha Sasana, is 7,000 sq. ft. in extent and will be a monumental gesture to mark the phenomenon. Corps of Engineer Services (CES) troops, together with the support of 8 Gemunu Watch and 8 Sri Lanka Sinha Regiment troops, were behind the erection of the much-needed new preaching hall and the renovation of the ancestral ‘Pothgul’ octagon at Wattarama sacred premises on the advice of the Department of Archaeology. Troops continue to complete other preparations at this sacred temple, in which the last Arahant (perfected person) of Buddhist tradition in Sri Lanka resided centuries ago.
The state ceremony at Wattarama Raja Maha Viharaya, headed by Mahanayakes (prelates) of all three Nikayas (sectors), religious dignitaries, the President, Prime Minister, Ministers, Service Chiefs, foreign delegates and a large gathering of devotees, takes place today on a grand scale.
On Vesak Full Moon Day, Army troops of the SFHQ-West at Panagoda Army Cantonment, together with the members of the Army Buddhist Association, will hold a full-day 'sil' observance programme at Panagoda Sri Maha Bodhirajarama temple before the Vesak zone inside the Panagoda Army Cantonment is inaugurated at dusk, in which hundreds of Vesak lanterns and other decorations will remain on display to the public until Saturday.
The special Buddha Rashmi Vesak zone, surrounding the Gangarama temple in the heart of Colombo, will also be adorned by Army-crafted Vesak lanterns and decorations between May 11 - 14. Army troops and members of the cultural troupe would also co-operate with the conduct of the 'mal perahera' (flower procession) at Gangaramaya on Sunday.
Staging of the devotional song (Bethi Gee) concert by way of ballet performances, ‘Inginalu Samagin Vesak Bethi Gee’ at Nelum Pokuna theatre on May 16 will be a major spectacle organized by the Army on account of the Vesak festival.
