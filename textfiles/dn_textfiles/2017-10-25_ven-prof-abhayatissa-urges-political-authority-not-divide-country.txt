Ven. Prof Abhayatissa urges political authority not to divide country

Ven. Prof Medagoda Abhayatissa Thera yesterday urged the political authority not to divide the country seeking short term political benefits, adding that the government has no mandate to divide the country and that the mandate was given to form a strong unitary State.
He was speaking at a press briefing held in Colombo at the Eliya Foundation with regard to the proposals in the interim report of the Steering Committee of the Constitutional Assembly.
“The devolution of power will not address the immediate concerns of ordinary Tamil people in this country. They only want to fulfill their basic needs, housing, health, education, livelihood concerns, security and other social problems faced by them,” he said.
Prof. Abhayatissa Thera said all minorities in this country have the freedom of enjoying all benefits enjoyed by the Sinhalese.
“Any person from the minority community has the ability to become the President, Prime Minister or hold any top positions. We never oppose such matters. But we never support any attempt to divide the country,” said the Thera.
Ven. Abhayathissa Thera also charged that the government is attempting to use the word “unitary” to create a federal government in Sri Lanka through the new Constitution.
Addressing the occasion, former Northern Province Governor Major General G.A. Chandrasiri charged that the proposals for a new Constitution presented in Parliament has reduced the powers vested with the governors which will badly affect the country. Film Director Sudath Rohana also addressed the occasion.
