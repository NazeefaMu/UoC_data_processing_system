Enshrouded in mysticism

Having rejected the idea of a god and taking up Buddhism and the practice of Buddhism, a few years later as a monk in Thailand when I asked some senior monks or some teachers about this thing called Nibbana, what is it, they said, ‘well, just believe in it. It is very hard to know, you can’t really explain it’. Straight away I saw that there was a correspondence there, a similarity, a disturbing similarity with the way that God was described to me as a young man. There I was having abandoned one sort of theory or unattainable mystery and then put my life on the line for another mystery
It is an interesting subject, and one that I haven’t dealt with before, and it will give an insight into the way of Buddhism and how we deal with mysticism, what mysticism is, its dangers and also its benefits. It gives a nice framework for a talk on an aspect of Buddhism which is not so often talked about and also puts it into place with all the other religious experiences which one may come across throughout this world, the good ones and the bad ones.
One of the reasons for giving a talk on mysticism this evening is that I have only just returned from Sydney this afternoon. I was giving a retreat at a retreat centre outside Sydney and one of the talks I gave was a clear explanation of this thing we call Nibbana or Enlightenment and the question time which followed afterwards, one of the questions I received was from a person who preferred Nibbana to remain a little mysterious rather than something as clearly described as I gave. It brought me to a little discussion at question time about the nature of such things as Nibbana, Buddhist Enlightenment, this idea of a god and all these other little things which sometimes people can lump together as mystical experiences, is it just out of faith or what are these things anyway.
I started my answer to the question when I recalled the time when I was still a student investigating the different religions and paths of practice in this world and came to point where I rejected the idea of a god simply because whenever I asked anyone, whether it was a priest or a teacher of religion or anyone who was supposed to know, they could never give me a straight answer on what god was supposed to be or supposed to mean. They always say things like, ‘it is beyond your knowledge; something which cannot be expressed’, and to me that was never satisfactory. To me something which didn’t exist would also be something you can’t express or you can’t know. It seemed to be an excuse for believing in something which couldn’t exist. I always thought that if something does exist, if it’s something real then there must be some way for you to know about it.
Practice of meditation
However, having rejected the idea of a god and taking up Buddhism and the practice of Buddhism, a few years later as a monk in Thailand when I asked some senior monks or some teachers about this thing called Nibbana, what is it, they said, ‘well, just believe in it. It is very hard to know, you can’t really explain it’. Straight away I saw that there was a correspondence there, a similarity, a disturbing similarity with the way that God was described to me as a young man. There I was having abandoned one sort of theory or unattainable mystery and then put my life on the line for another mystery. Really, I wasn’t very satisfied with that, but thankfully there was a path of practice which kept me going as a monk. There was a path of practice of meditation which at least made me happy which gave some joy into my mind and into my life, and that was enough to keep me going until I got some deeper understanding of these things.
One of the important things which you do understand in this practice of Buddhism is that there is no mystery that you cannot see for yourselves through direct experience. The point of this practice of Buddhism from the beginnings of just being generous, being virtuous, being kind, meditating, becoming deeply peaceful in the mind, becoming wise, all these parts of the gradual training which we call the practice of Buddhism actually do lead to the wisdom, the direct experience, the insight which sees all of these things which can be seen, which knows all that can be known, and all of these things which the Buddha talked about, whether it is past lives, whether it is devas, divine beings, if you wish to call them that, and enlightenment itself. All of these things are something which can be known and experienced for yourself, clearly experienced, and not something which just has to be believed in or talked about in a very mysterious way. It is nice to be able to hear someone talk clearly about these things because very often a person talks in mysterious words when they are trying to cover up a lack of knowledge about the subject.
If they say that Nibbana, Enlightenment is like ineffable, indescribable, just beyond words, very often it means that they have no idea what it means anyway, so it is like an excuse to cover up some ignorance or lack of experience but the great monks which I eventually got to know could describe and explain. Obviously one had to have some experience of the mind of deep meditation before one could appreciate the words which the great teachers were using, but certainly all these things were explainable, were describable. And these experiences which the Buddha talked about, once they were experienced by these great monks, the whole of these teachings, the deep teachings the part of religion which the world calls mysterious or mystical, is all made very clear and very understandable and very reachable. That of course was immensely satisfying. One didn’t just have to believe as an act of faith or an act of trust, but one could see and hear and experience all these things.
Western culture
So let’s go back to the beginning of mysticism, and all the different experiences, which come under that heading of mysticism which you may have heard about, read about, or sometimes even experienced. You will find that in our western culture, mysticism always depends upon people not living as it were in the world and thinking about things, but the mystics were the people who removed themselves from the world for a time or for their whole life.
In Christianity, these were people who lived in mountains, in deserts usually; in Buddhism, in forests. But in any culture, people who wander alone live in solitary places. Of course what they would be developing in those places is a meditation of like letting go. This is why it is so important to understand these things, to develop some degree of deep meditation. Because all of that which is called mystical in our culture, is developed from a very peaceful and still mind. And it is there that one can start to understand where mysticism arises from, the experiences which are called mystical, and how they all fit together, as it were in the scheme of things. What happens for a person who is meditating, is that your goal is to let go of so much of the external world, which is so coarse and gross compared to the world of the mind.
I sometimes describe the world of the mind to the world outside like coarse signals on a radio frequency which block out the very fine and subtle signals. Therefore, if one wishes to see that which is subtle and refined, you have to filter out the coarse, the gross, and you do find this is the way of meditation. When you let go of the coarser things of the world, the busyness of life, then you are able to see that which is far more refined. Even on a small level, if you can just stop for a while thinking of all you have to do and the places you have to go and you can pause, then you can be able to appreciate the beauty of the tree in the park on the corner. You have time in your mind to look up at the stars, and just see the heavens. But so often it is the case that people are running around too fast, they are so engrossed with the coarse, that they never see that which is refined and very beautiful.
