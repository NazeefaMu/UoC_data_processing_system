Old car park turns into an underground farm

This is La Caverne, an old car park in Paris transformed into an underground farm! It is the French startup Cycloponics, launched by Théophile Champagnat and Jean-Noël Gertz, who had the idea to recycle these huge empty spaces to create a mushroom in the heart of Paris, Porte de la Chapelle. La Caverne is an urban and underground farm of more than 3500 m²!
La Caverne is the first organic farm in Paris, capable of producing mushrooms, endives, oyster mushrooms, shiitakes and young plants, and of course without GMO, without pesticides, and certified organic farming! This is an awesome concept that allows them to deliver by bike fresh products, harvested the same day, to many restaurants. More information is available on the website of La Caverne. Ufunk
