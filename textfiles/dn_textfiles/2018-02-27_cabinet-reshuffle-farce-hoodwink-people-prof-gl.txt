Cabinet reshuffle: Farce to hoodwink people: Prof. G.L.

The National Unity Government’s Cabinet reshuffle is a farce designed to hoodwink the people, Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) Chairman Prof. G.L.Peiris said yesterday
Addressing a press conference at SLPP head office at Nelum Mawatha, Battaramulla, Peiris said that although the Government promised a complete Cabinet overhaul, only a few individuals had swapped portfolios.
Peiris noted that the failure of the United People’s Freedom Alliance Ministers to take oaths was a clear sign of the divisions which exists between the two parties in the so-called unity government.
The former minister charged that appointing more ministers only meant that the cost of living burden on the people will be further increased.
He said the SLPP would launch a protest campaign demanding the government to hold a general election as the ruling party had been rejected by the people at the recent LG polls.
