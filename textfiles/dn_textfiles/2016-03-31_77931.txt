Left-wing parties May Day rally

 
The May Day rally jointly organized by Socialist People’s Front, Mahajana Eksath Peramuna and other left-wing parties with the Joint Trade Unions Movement will be held on May 1 at 3 p.m. at Kirulapone Grounds.
Addressing the media at the N.M. Perera Centre at Borella yesterday, Prof. Tissa Vitarana said the May Day rally organized by left-wing political parties will be held under the theme of the “Working People’s May Day Celebrations” and the main objective of organising the rally is to voice their opposition against the UNP policies of the present government.
“Through this rally we hope to urge the government to fulfill the pledges given to the people during the election campaign and to ensure the rights people.” said Prof Vitarana.
He also said that the SLFPers are also welcomed to join the rally since we only want to oppose the UNP’s Regaining Sri Lanka policies being implemented by the present government.
