Non-declaration of assets and liabilities
Five cases against Johnston taken up

The trial into five cases filed against former Minister Johnston Fernando over non-declaration of his assets and liabilities from 2010 to 2014, was yesterday taken up before the Colombo Chief Magistrate Ranga Dissanayake.
The former President’s Secretary P.B.Abeykoon was yesterday present in Court as a prosecution witness. P.B.Abeykoon while giving evidence admitted that he handed over a letter to the Bribery Commission regarding the non-declaration of the former Minister Johnston Fernando’s assets and liabilities.
President Counsel Kalinga Indatissa appearing on behalf of former Minister Johnston Fernando informed the Magistrate that earlier the Senior Assistant President’s Secretary, Chandima Wickramasinghe ascertained that there were no documents available at the Presidential Secretariat to prove the declaration of any assets and liabilities of the former Minister, according to her knowledge.
Former Colombo Chief Magistrate Lal Ranasinghe Bandara had earlier fixed the trial for yesterday. However, Chief Magistrate Ranga Dissanayake stated that he needs to study this case more.
