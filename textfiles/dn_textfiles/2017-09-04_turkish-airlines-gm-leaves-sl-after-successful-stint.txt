Turkish Airlines GM leaves SL after successful stint

Turkish Airlines General Manager, Sri Lanka, Ozgur Suucak handed over his duties to counterpart Murat Baydar on September 1.
After working in multiple departments in Turkish Airlines in many countries, Suucak who has been General Manager in Sri Lanka since 2013 has now been appointed as General Manager of Turkish Airlines in Bishkek, Kyrgyzstan, September 1.
Turkish Airlines’ Sri Lanka, established its office and started operations in 2013 with four flights a week.
Within a successful year of operations, the flights increased to daily flights. Since October 2016, Turkish Airlines further added a cargo freighter which operates once a week and has planned to increase to two cargo freighters per week within the coming months.
Suucak said, “I believe that the historic relationship between Sri Lanka and Turkey has been sealed with Turkish Airlines flying into Sri Lanka. Turkish Airlines has added more value to Sri Lanka tourism due to its vast network of 300 destinations around the globe. Being awarded ‘The Best Airline’ in four categories at the Skykrax Passengers Choice Awards 2017, Turkish Arline has given the Sri Lankan market an opportunity to choose flying with an award winning European carrier and experience the quality of the flying experience. They would also be able to have better connections with the rest of the world since Turkish Airlines flies to more counties than any other airline.”
“I like to thank Sri Lankan authorities, namely the Civil Aviation, the Government and all travel agents and staff for their support and hospitality given to me. As a stable European carrier which will continue to fly to Sri Lanka, I would like more and more Sri Lankans to come and experience flying with Turkish Airlines. I like to wish Murat Baydar all the very best on his new appointment.”
