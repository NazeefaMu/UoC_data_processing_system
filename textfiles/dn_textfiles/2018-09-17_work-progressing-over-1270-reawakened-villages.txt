Work progressing on over 1,270 reawakened villages

The Housing and Construction Ministry has begun construction on more than 1,270 reawakened villages throughout the country. Our target is to complete 2,500 reawakened villages by December, 31, 2019, Housing and Construction Minister Sajith Premadasa said.
“This is a big challenge. But, after completing 2,500 villages, we will begin work at another 5,000 model villages on January 1,2020. Without stopping at that, we will inaugurate work on another 10,000 model villages and thereafter on another 2,500 villages to ensure that each and every family in Sri Lanka has a roof over their heads by 2025,” Minister Premadasa said.
He was addressing a meeting after opening the Nadeejayagama reawakened villages in Paragoda west Bulathsinhala recently.
This was the 4th reawakened village opened in the Kalutara district by his ministry so far.
Minister Premadasa said the Yahapalana Government had ensured tangible development work throughout the country.
He said however, that he was not content with the 30 new village built in the Kalutara district. The target he gave the district manager was 50 villages. But he had decided to increase this to 100 villages by year end.
Minister Premadasa said the people elected them to power with immense hope sand expectations. Therefore, it is their duty to work around the clock to fulfil these expectations.
Commending NHDA officials in the Kalutara district for a job well done in bringing the reawakened village to fruition, he added that he would grant them promotions with attendant salary increments. He said India which was inspired by the housing development program undertaken by the government had extended a credit line of 600 million Indian rupees to boost Sri Lanka’s housing development programme. Thereafter, India granted another 600 million Indian rupees with Cabinet approval for the housing programme in response to a request made by him. In hindsight, he was wondering whether the Opposition would conduct an agitation against Indian assistance towards the housing programme alleging that the government was selling off assets to India.
Minister Premadasa said the Opposition also agitated against the 1990 Ambulance Service donated by India. So many innocent live had been saved in this country, thanks to this ambulance service.
He said the “Pohottuwa” party which was smarting under the failure of is ‘Janabalaya Colambata’ was trying to find a scape goat by bringing a false milk packet issue to hide its utter flop.
