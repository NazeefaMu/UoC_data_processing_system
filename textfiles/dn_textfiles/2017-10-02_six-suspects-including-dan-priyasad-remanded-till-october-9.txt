Six suspects including Dan Priyasad remanded till October 9

Six suspects who were arrested by police in connection with a mob attack on a group of Rohingya refugees who were seeking shelter at a United Nations High Commission for Refugees (UNHCR) safe house in Mount Lavinia on Tuesday (26), have been remanded until October 9 by the Mount Lavinia Magistrate.
The latest suspects arrested include Liyanage Abeyrathne and Suresh Priyasad alias Dan who goes by the moniker Dan Priyasad. Prior to his arrest Dan Priyasad had posted on this social media page saying that Police had visited his home to arrest him but he was in hiding.
Police have also arrested a 24-year-old woman, who has been identified as Kalyani Podi Menike, a resident of Ratmalana for taking part in the attack. The others who are in remand custody include Janitha Niroshana Deepagey, Nawalage Don Chinthaka Sanjeewa and Nanayakkara Godakanda Kankanamlage Gayan Madushanka Senevirathne.
Thirty-one Rohingya refugees, mostly women and children who were seeking shelter in a UNHCR safe house in Mount Lavinia came under an attack by a mob who stoned the shelter prompting the refugees to leave the premises. The refugees who were detained in April this year by the Navy are presently seeking shelter at the Boosa Detention Camp in Galle to ensure their security following this incident.
An order has also been issued by a court in Galle preventing any form of protests around the Boosa detention camp. The order was issued after threats by some groups who wanted to stage a protest against the Rohingya refugees being given protection at the camp.
