Special Determination petition filed challenging Registration of Electors Bill

 
A Special Determination petition challenging the bill titled “Registration of Electors (Special Provisions)" was filed before Supreme Court today by a former Member of Maharagama Urban Council, seeking a declaration that bill shall become law only through a two-third majority in Parliament and the approval of the people at a referendum.
The petitioner stated that a bill titled “Registration of Electors (Special Provisions)" was presented to the Parliament and placed on Order Paper of the Parliament on May 3, 2017.
The petitioner stated that the long title of the Bill provides it to pass a law to make special provisions to exempt internally displaced persons from certain requirements of the Registration of Electors Act, No. 44 of 1980; and to provide for matters connected therewith or incidental thereto.
The said Bill has been –prima facie – placed in Parliament violating the mandatory procedure as provided for in Article 78 of the Constitution as the Bill had not been published in the Government Gazette in terms of Article 78 of the Constitution, petitioner Nishantha Wimalachandra added.
The Petitioner states the clauses 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, of the Bill are inconsistent with Articles 3, 4, 12(1), 12(2), 78(1), 78(2) of the Constitution.
This special determination petition was filed through senior counsel Kanishka Vitharana and counsel H.M.Tillekaratne.
