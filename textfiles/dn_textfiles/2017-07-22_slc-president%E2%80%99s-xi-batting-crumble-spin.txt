SLC President’s XI batting crumble to spin

Gunathilaka, Thirimanne score half-centuries:
Sri Lanka Cricket President’s XI put up a feeble display of batting against Indian left-arm spinners Ravindra Jadeja and Kuldeep Yadav to collapse from 139-1 to 187 all out on the first day of the two-day practice match played at the CCC grounds yesterday.
By stumps India had replied with 135 for three wickets.
The President’s XI top order was bolstered by a 130-run stand between Danushka Gunathilaka and skipper Lahiru Thirimanne who both made half centuries.
Gunathilaka struck 11 fours in his 74 scored off 97 balls and Thirimanne a sedate 59 off 125 balls that included two sixes and five fours.
Jadeja broke through for India by dismissing Thirimanne and Dhananjaya de Silva (0) in one over and ran out Gunathilaka to affect the collapse. The rest of the President’s XI innings folded up tamely with Jadeja picking up four wickets and Yadav three with his left-arm chinaman.
Opener Lokesh Rahul struck a 58-ball half-century (7 fours) before being dismissed. Abhinav Mukund (0) and Cheteshwar Pujara (12) both fell cheaply to Vishwa Fernando but skipper Virat Kohli (34) and Ajinkya Rahane (30) saw India through without any further loss for the day.
