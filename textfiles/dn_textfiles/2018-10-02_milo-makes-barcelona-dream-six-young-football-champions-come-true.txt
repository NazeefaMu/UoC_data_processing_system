Milo makes the Barcelona dream of six young football champions come true

Six young talented Sri Lankan football players flew to Spain for a fully sponsored trip by Milo, to make their ultimate football fantasy come true. They will be attending a four day coaching camp run by FC Barcelona, where world class Football training will be offered by Milo’s “Road to Barcelona”, presenting the participants with a once in a lifetime experience.
Milo’s efforts to develop local football champions among school children kicked off with an All-Island under 12 Football tournament, where six best performed players were selected after an extensive training for an all-expense paid trip organised by Milo to a four day football coaching camp run by one of the leading professional football clubs in the world, FC Barcelona.
Partnering with the Ministry of Education and the Schools’ Football Association, “Road to Barcelona” is an initiative taken by Milo to develop local Football champions and give them a wholesome experience of the international football arena. The six lucky winners who embarked on this Barcelona mission are; M.I.M. Said of Hameed Al-Husainia College Colombo, M.A.A. Shan of Trinity College Kandy, K.M. Kalheem of Kinniya Al-Aqsa College, A. Simar of Pulawarmani Sherifudeen School, Dulani Sandeepani of Bendiwewa Maha Vidyalaya Polonnaruwa and WidushaVinodya of Kavisigamuwe Maha Vidyalaya.
The children will be accompanied by a teacher, President of the Sri Lanka Schools Football Association (SLSFA) and an employee of Nestlé Lanka.
They departed the country on the 29th of September and will witness the ultimate football experience of attending a training in Camp Nou, the home stadium of FCB. The coaching camp will be held from the 1st to 3rd of October inclusive of the ‘Escola’ football clinic, technical skills development on the pitch, ‘Camp Nou’ classroom sessions, museum visit, city tour, interact with FC Barcelona coaches and take part in many fun filled games while getting along with team members of participating Milo countries such as Trinidad & Tobago, Panama, Vietnam, Thailand, New Zealand, Indonesia, Australia, and Pakistan.
