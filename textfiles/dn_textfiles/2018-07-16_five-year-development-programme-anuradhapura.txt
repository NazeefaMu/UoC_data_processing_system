Five-year development programme for Anuradhapura

The government’s Gam Peraliya village development programme and Enterprise Sri Lanka programme would bring about the long-felt economical emancipation in Sri Lanka, emphasised Irrigation, Water Resources and Disaster Management Minister Duminda Dissanayake.
He said so following the launching of UNDP-funded five-year development plan for Anuradhapura (2018-22), held at Anuradhapura Kachcheri auditorium recently.
The minister stated that Gam Peraliya programme would be launched in Anuradhapura district next month. Under this revolutionary development programme, rural roads, tanks and schools would be upgraded and green parks equipped with jogging paths on the basis of one green park per DS division. Village temples including shrines belonging to other religions would be offered minimum Rs. 500,000 for repairs. The tourist industry would be promoted and aid granted for having permanent roofing for dwellings. In addition, a range of loan facilities, interest-free or on micro interest would be introduced under the Enterprise Sri Lanka scheme. A special loan amounting to Rs. 350,000 would be given for installation of solar panels and domestic electrification and a loan up to Rs. 1.5 million for graduates studying further, both interest-free. Businessman entrepreneurs and self-employment seekers would be granted loan facilities at six percent interest. All these projects are aimed in enhancing national production and alleviating poverty and bringing economic stability to the country, Dissanayake said.The minister said that there would be close coordination among ministries, departments and various other agencies working.
The minister requested the officials to study the five-year plan and come out with shortcomings and practical problems in implementation, suggestions for changes to be made in any particular component for betterment, and oversights if any. He pointed out the high importance of discussing with the grass root level rural organisations about the 2018 - 2022 five year development plan for enhancing the masses’ participation in it.
