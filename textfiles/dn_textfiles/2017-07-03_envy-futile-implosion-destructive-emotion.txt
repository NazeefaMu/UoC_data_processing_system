Envy a futile implosion of a destructive emotion

There’s a reason it’s called the green-eyed monster -- jealousy is ugly. And where did it ever get you, anyway? Whether you fear losing a relationship or wish you had things other people have, you need to let go. When it comes to your relationships, nothing is more attractive than genuine confidence. And as for having stuff, remember: You can’t take it with you, so why fret about what you’re supposedly missing?
A combination of emotions
Jealousy is possibly the most destructive emotion housed in the human brain. Jealousy is a complex emotion that encompasses many different kinds of feelings that range from fear of abandonment to rage to humiliation. Jealousy can strike both men and women when they perceive a third-party threat to a valued relationship, it can be a problem among siblings competing for parental attention, or envy for a wealthier more successful friend.
Conventional wisdom holds that jealousy is a necessary emotion because it preserves social bonds. But jealousy usually does more harm than good to relationships, and can create relationship conflict and violence. Jealousy is an emotion, and the word typically refers to the thoughts and feelings of insecurity, fear, concern, and anxiety over an anticipated loss of status or something of great personal value, particularly in reference to a human connection.

Jealousy often consists of a combination of emotions such as anger, resentment, inadequacy, helplessness and disgust. In its original meaning, jealousy is distinct from envy, though the two terms have popularly become synonymous in the English language, with jealousy now also taking on the definition originally used for envy alone. Jealousy is a typical experience in human relationships. It has been observed in infants five months and older. Some claim that jealousy is seen in every culture. However, others claim jealousy is a culture-specific phenomenon.
It’s no fun to feel envy or jealousy because both make you feel inadequate. Envy basically is when you want what someone else has, but jealousy is when you’re worried someone’s trying to take what you have. If you want your neighbour’s new swank vehicle, you feel envy. If she takes your husband for a ride, you feel jealousy.
Lovers’ triangles
Envy requires two parties, such as you and that neighbour, when you want her new car and you wish you were the one riding around town in real style. You feel envy when you want something someone else has. Jealousy requires three parties, like you, your neighbour, and your husband, when not only do you wish you had that cool car, but you’re worried your husband is going to ride off into the sunset in it without you. Jealousy is exciting theatre because it shows up in lovers’ triangles and Shakespeare’s plays:
Overcoming jealousy is like changing any emotional reaction or behaviour. It begins with awareness. Awareness allows you to see that the projected stories in your mind are not true. When you have this clarity you no longer react to the scenarios that your mind imagines. Jealousy and anger are emotional reactions to believing scenarios in your mind that are not true. By changing what you believe you change what your imagination is projecting and you can eliminate these destructive emotional reactions. Even when there is justification for the reaction, jealousy and anger are not beneficial ways to deal with the situation and get what we want.
A survey of therapists revealed that jealousy was the major problem in one-third of all clients seeking psychotherapy. Makes sense when you consider that it’s one of the most complex and intense human emotions. Born of a cocktail of frustration, suspicion, envy, and sadness, jealousy can tempt you into totally irrational behaviour, which you, in a better state of mind, would never consider or condone.
At the core, jealousy stems from insecurity. Talking about insecurity is one of the most vulnerable things a person can do. It’s admitting to a belief that you are inadequate. It is never easy. But within a loving, supportive relationship, it will only ever change things for the better. On the other hand, if the issue of jealousy isn’t resolved, your relationship will inevitably fail.
Primal emotions
Of all the emotions humans show, jealousy is one of the most common and unsettling. It tends to bring out the worst in us, even though most of us know better. It’s an age-old problem, having been recorded since biblical times, and no doubt experienced even before that. And it’s not limited to humans, either. Even wild animals like chimpanzees and elephants exhibit jealous tendencies.
We all feel jealous from time to time but admitting it is the first step to overcoming it. Jealousy is not limited solely to relationships. You can become jealous of your friends’ or associates’ good fortune. This also ties in to feelings of self-worth. A person who doesn’t have a strong self-image may feel that he’s not getting his “fair share” and that others always “get the breaks.”
Envy, jealousy, and shame are inextricably intertwined. Envy and jealousy are primal emotions that frequently overlap. They’re commonly first felt in the form of sibling rivalry and Oedipal longings. A child innately wants mommy and daddy all to him — or herself and feels ‘excluded’ from the marital bond, especially if there have been parenting deficits that have led to shame and emotional abandonment.
Children are frequently envious and jealous of the attention showered on a newborn sibling. Belief that a sibling is favoured can create lifelong feelings of shame and inadequacy. No one enjoys feeling jealous. Yet, jealousy is an inevitable emotion that pretty much every one of us will experience. The problem with jealousy isn’t that it comes up from time to time, but what it does to us when we don’t get a grip on it. It can be frightening to experience what happens when we allow our jealousy to overpower us or to shape the way we feel about ourselves and the world around us. That is why understanding where our jealous feelings actually come from and learning how to deal with jealousy in healthy, adaptive ways is key to so many areas of our lives from our interpersonal relationships to our careers to our personal goals.
Finally remember, there will always be someone out there who is more beautiful, more talented, and more successful. But so what?
