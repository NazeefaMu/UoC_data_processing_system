CR – Army game should be a close tussle for supremacy

CR and FC who lost to CH and FC 12-19 last time around will go all out to overcome the unpredictable Army sports club in their Dialog ‘A’ Division League rugby match at CR grounds in Longden Place today. Kick off will be at 4.00pm.
At Longden Place another terrific tussle for supremacy can be expected today. CR will miss the services of their second row forward Panduka Angammana who is on the injured list. Mean whil the red shirt Skipper Kavindu Perera who was suspended in the last match against the CH outfit will make a welcome return to the side.
Navy will go out favourites
The high-riding Navy sports Club will go out favourites against Police Sports Club in their Dialog ‘A’ Division League rugby match today at Welisara.
Match will commence at 4.00pm. The Navy Sports Club played a superb game against Havies Sports Club in their last game at Welisara to topple them 25-14 , will have to come up with another similar performance if they hope to overcome the Cops with a bonus point victory in the end.
The forte of the Navy side have been their power-packed forwards and they should come up with another superb display with skipper Roshan Ranasinghe, Supun Peiris along with ever green flanker and captain Danushka “Gertha” Perera are likely to give of their best in todays game.
