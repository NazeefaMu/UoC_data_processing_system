School to produce able politicians

A ‘Political education school’ aiming to produce educated and able politicians who are capable to bring the country forward will be started next month under the initiative of President Maithripala Sirisena, Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) Youth Front Chairman Shantha Bandara said.
The political education school, which is a brainchild of President Sirisena, will create highly capable politicians through its well organised political education procedure.
Students of the school will undergo lectures on various topics including local and international politics, economy, constitution, culture, history, international relations among others.
The lectures will be conducted by veterans in the respective fields, Bandara said.
