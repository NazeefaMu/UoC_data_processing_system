Law and Order and Southern Development Minister Sagala Ratnayaka has asked IGP Pujith Jayasundara for a report on the shooting of the officers from the Anti-Narcotics Unit in Piliyandala on Tuesday night.
The IGP is to submit a report within three days.
A group on motorbikes had opened fire at the Policemen while they were conducting a raid to seize 10 kg of drugs from drug dealers in the area.
At around 8.54 pm on Tuesday, a team from the Anti-Narcotics Unit were at the People’s Bank on Moratuwa road, Piliyandala when the Police were shot at by a group of unidentified men. A police officer was killed in the incident and one sustained serious injuries. The shooting had also injured four others which included an eight-year-old girl and a 15-year-old boy.
With policemen being shot at, the minister had asked for a report from the IGP as to why the team had undertaken the raid with little preparation and why they chose to go ahead with the raid under such circumstances.
The IGP has appointed Senior Deputy IGP M.R. Lathief on the case. The Police in the meantime, discovered an abandoned motorbike in the Maharagama Police Division but said they could not confirm whether it was linked to the shooting.
