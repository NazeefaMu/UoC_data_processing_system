Otara Foundation for Animal Welfare and Wildlife Conservation
Pursuing a childhood dream

Riding on the tides caused by the killing of the Galgamuwa tusker and the renewed interest in the ubiquitous Human-Elephant Conflict, the Daily News turned to one of Sri Lanka’s most successful and influential entrepreneurs, Otara Gunewardene for her perspectives on the matter. Her passion for wildlife and conservation is no secret and she believes that our wildlife is “one of our greatest assets.” Known particularly as being the founder of ODEL, Otara has now shifted her focus to her childhood dream which is focussing on animal welfare and wildlife conservation.
Could you please tell us a bit about the Otara Foundation?
After ODEL I decided to focus more on animal welfare and wildlife conservation through Embark and the Otara Foundation so that I could pursue my childhood dream which was to help animals. It was definitely one reason to leave business.
What inspired you to establish the Otara Foundation?
The desire to pursue my childhood dream of helping animals.
What are your thoughts on the Human Elephant Conflict?
It is an incredibly unfortunate situation, but it doesn’t need to be that way. Wildlife and forests are of utmost value. They are one of our greatest assets and it should be made possible for other things to function around it. Unplanned development is a key factor that escalates this issue. We have the knowledge to enable development and protecting our wildlife to go hand in hand and we must use that knowledge to protect our natural heritage. It should also be kept in mind that the Human-Elephant Conflict not only affects elephants but also the people, other wildlife and forests around. There are so many alternative options for development while ensuring the protection of elephant corridors and their homes. We have to understand that the elephants are just trying to survive and provide for their families when this “conflict” happens. We should be proud and understand the uniqueness of what we have with our elephants and wildlife. Something needs to be done to improve the management and enforce the laws to stop the poaching of all animals.
As an ambassador for wildlife and someone who promotes a world with animals and people, what are your thoughts on the shooting of the Galgamuwa tusker?
It’s incredibly sad and also frightening that a trend to kill our tuskers has started again. When you travel around Sri Lanka, you will understand how much poaching there is now of all animals. We need to do something about it, and it must be done now. I believe we are at the tipping point towards losing a lot of our wildlife forever. We should be doing everything possible to protect them for future generations.Animals are also affected by individuals who are poaching for the meat trade, when habitats are destroyed when trees are cut for timber or for ad hocdevelopment. The importance of protecting such an incredible natural heritage as the one we are blessed with is well known by many and they all hope that stronger action will be taken to protect it.
What do you think about the laws in Sri Lanka to do with the conservation of elephant and minimization of the Human Elephant Conflict?
I am not a lawyer and my legal know-how on the matter is limited, however while we have good fauna and flora protection laws, the animal welfare laws in this country are inadequate and extremely weak. The new animal welfare bill which was approved by the Cabinet 2 years ago is still pending approval by Parliament. For wildlife, what really needs to be focussed on is enforcement of the laws which will deter the escalating poaching, especially for elephants and tuskers, as we don’t have many left. Action needs to happen because there is no use in making arrests once the damage is done and the species are no more.Justice while rendering some satisfaction does not solve the problem.

Do you have any plans for elephant conservation?
The Otara Foundation supports some environmental organizations and groups and sometimes the government when possible. We do whatever we can to help various movements, but a lot to do with wildlife has to be done by the government, so it is not easy to help directly. They are the main stakeholders and guardians of our wildlife. An overall action plan is necessary.
What message would you like to give regarding the importance of  elephant conservation?
Elephants are one of our greatest assets. They are also a source of revenue through the tourism that we bring into the country. It would be an absolute shame to lose them. Killing off the males which roam out of protected areas will make the species unable to reproduce.
Translocating them too is making the gene pool weak. We can’t keep jumbling up a natural environment, at some point it’s going to give.
Waves of disappointment are apparent across social media as citizens too are realizing the gravity of the situation.
There are even murmurs and campaigns about voting only for those candidates who care for animals both domestic and wild and for those who understand the need to protect our last remaining forests and offer a solution for conservation. It is of utmost importance that we act now.
