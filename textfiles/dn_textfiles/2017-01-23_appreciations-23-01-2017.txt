[APPRECIATIONS - (23-01-2017)]

Justice C.G. Weeramantry
Jurist and advocate of highest calibre
My first contact with Justice C.G. Weeramantry goes back to 1956 when doing the final year of the Advocates course at the Law College. He was our lecturer in the Law of Contracts.
Although he and I are of the same vintage having reached our 90th year almost simultaneously, he had entered Law College much earlier than me and was now enjoying a lucrative civil practice at the Colombo Bar which demands for his services coming thick and fast from the outstations.
When I started practice in early 1958, I was not personally known to Justice Weeramantry, but following the stand I took when the independence of the Bar was threatened by certain events that took place that year, he invited me to work with him.
I did so for a short time till I ventured on my own and lawyers like the calibre of Nehru Goonatilake PC and others joined him forming a formidable group in the profession.
Two incidents that arose from the close association bring happy memories today. One was when he was retained by the Kandy Omni Bus Company for a case in the District Court Kandy, I had the pleasure of his company sharing a double bed room at Queens Hotel for an overnight stay.
At about this time, one of my brothers was the international manager of Ceylon Insurance Company stationed in Singapore handpicked by Justin Kotelawala.
However, the two of them fell out and the matter came up in the then Industrial Court where Justice Weeramantry appeared for my brother with me and E.G. Wickremanayake QC appeared for Justin Kotelawala.
Justice Weeramantry was so much feared as an opposing counsel, that Wickremanayake advised Justin Kotelawala to avoid any inquiry and settle the case.
Justice Weeramantry was keenly alive to the social and political changes taking place at this time. In the tussle raging between J.R. and Dudley, he was openly and fearlessly on Dudley’s side and organised meetings of lawyers at his home to evolve a strategy for Dudley to resume leadership of the UNP and stand as the Prime Ministerial candidate at the 1965 general election.
I was one of the invitees for this meeting. We had a pleasant time at the parties hosted by Justice Weeramantry and his wife, who hailed from the de Sampayo clan, at their Suleiman Avenue residence in this connection as well as when he took Silk and became a Supreme Court Judge.
Justice Weeramantry was a jurist and an advocate of the highest caliber.
He excelled in genuine research in producing his monumental work on the Law of Contacts which brought him plaudits and accolades from universities the world over.
Members of the Academia whose research is partly plagiaristic, will do well to emulate him when he developed the meanings of the concept in the law of contracts from their primeval sources giving worldwide references to case law as well.
Justice Weeramantry realised the need for a free and independent Bar as the surest guarantee for the preservation of democracy, the rule of law, human rights and judicial integrity.
In the year 1958, when the then minister of justice M.W.H.de Silva, QC, a known follower of Chairman Mao Tsetung’s politics wanted to socialise the legal profession by introducing the ‘college system’ as practiced in China, I with logistical support from advocate Ivon Perera of Gower Street took it upon ourselves to oppose it.
E.R.S.R.Coomarasamy PC was collecting counter signatures for a memorandum to be presented to the government. The threat to the independence of the Bar was imminent. But senior lawyers were slow to react. I prepared a memorandum and went about collecting counter signatures. The initial response was weak. For one thing, our memorandum contained only Platitudinous Statements but not a word about refuting the college system.
Justice Weeramantry not only singed our memorandum, but added a new paragraph in his own handwriting to our working paper rejecting the college system. In doing so he displayed his legal acumen and political philosophy in no small measure. His joining our movement resulted in an avalanche of support coming our way and we won the day.
Present day lawyers many not be aware of this episode in their history. When the present outgoing president of the Bar Association was asked to take official recognition of the matter because of the failure of its predecessor the General Council of Advocates to maintain records, he did not show any interest. At least for the part played by Justice Weeramantry in that controversy he should have responded positively.
Justice Weeramantry was a man apart. When compared with the general run of lawyers who have opted to take office judicial or otherwise one can only quote S.W.R.D. Bandaranaike who once said in Parliament "some people adorn the office, others the office adorns."
When Justice Weeramantry decided to assume Supreme Court Office and from there proceed to Monash University as Professor of Law and finally end up as vice president of the International Court of Justice, he was lost to his colleagues but the world gained him.
May his soul rest in peace.

Sunil Rodrigo
A true friend
It is with a sense of profound loss and sadness I write this appreciation of Sunil Rodrigo my friend and guru and former chairman of Lake House who passed away peacefully with his family at his bedside.
He was born 89 years ago in Paragastota, a village close to Horana and was named Sunil by Anagarika Dharmapala, a relative of his mother. He was educated at S. Thomas' College and graduated from University College, Colombo after which he proceeded to London to study law.
At the London School of Economics, he was active in student politics and was elected president of the student union known as the Majlis. There he made friends with Krishna Menon and Paul Robeson. At the first Commonwealth Prime Minister's Conference Krishna Menon introduced Sunil to then Prime Minister D.S. Senanayake as "a young man whom you should keep an eye on."
At this time Sunil had a regular weekly broadcast in English over the BBC overseas service regarding life in post-war England. After graduating in Political Science from LSC, he was called to the Bar from the Middle Temple in England.
Soon after, Shell Company recruited him in London and returned to Ceylon to join the Colombo Office. His stint at Shell Colombo did not last long as he could not put up with the obnoxious behaviour of other British executives. Sir UkwatteJayasundera invited him to join his Chambers for whom he had acted as an unofficial tour guide of London when Sir Ukwatte visited London as part of the Sri Lankan delegation to the first Commonwealth Prime Ministers' Conference. Soon he developed a lucrative law practice by dint of hard work and punctuality and treating his clients and opponents without denigrating or disparaging them.
Later he joined G. G. Ponnambalam's chambers. I met Sunil quite by accident when I was stranded at the Ratnapura bus stand on my way to the Rakwana Magistrate's Court to give medical evidence. I managed to hitch a ride to the Pelmadulla rest house where I met Sunil sipping a scotch. He invited me to have a drink with him and join him for dinner, both of which I demurred but he persuaded me to join him as I believe he guessed the reason for my hesitancy.
The next day when I went to check out, I found out that not only had Sunil paid my bill but he was offering a ride in his chauffeur driven Mercedes Benz to the courthouse in Rakwana. This event in the early 1960's was the beginning of a life-long friendship.
In spite of his short temper, he was a very generous man and always sided with the underdog. Thus when the Health Department declined to grant me leave of absence to accept a Fellowship at the Karolinska Institute in Stockholm, Sunil intervened pro-Bono on my behalf and obtained the leave. On most evenings his veranda was like a club house with clients and junior lawyers discussing various topics.
President Ranasinghe Premadasa on becoming president offered the Sri Lanka ambassadorship to London to Sunil which he declined, but as an appeasement to the president, he accepted the Chairmanship of Lake House for a short time.
Sunil had an extensive knowledge of the history, flora, and fauna of Sri Lanka. He collected old Sri Lanka books and coins. On our various trips to the National Parks, he always carried a pair of binoculars and his tattered book on birds of Ceylon.
We endlessly discussed various topics of Sri Lankan history such as urn burials practiced by the pre-Vijayan inhabitants of Thambapani or that Kudrimali the ancient port city in North Western Sri Lanka where horses were imported as Hippuros mentioned in Ptolemy's map of Taprobane.
I met him last in February 2016 when he offered me a second drink of his favourite single malt scotch. When I hesitated, he said that this would be the last drink we will be having together.
When I finally got up to leave Sunil and Tilaka his wife of 60 years they slowly walked me up to the door bade me good-bye saying that we would meet again somewhere in Samsara.

Terence Ashely Peiris and Leela Rosemund Peiris
Grandparents who cannot be forgotten
It is with deep sorrow and affection that I write this appreciation of my beloved maternal grand parents, Terence Ashely Peiris and Leela Rosemund Peiris whom I called Ber. Thaththa and Am Amma from my childhood.
While Ber Thaththa passed away on December 9, 2003 at the age of 77 , Am Amma went to be with Jesus just one year ago.
She passed away on January 21, 2016 at the age of 82. I was born on the same day of their 26th wedding anniversary and was lucky to get their love and affection as their first grand child.
They married on April 30, 1953 and with the strength and courage received from our Lord Almighty they lived an exemplary and happy wedded life together and even celebrated their Golden Wedding in April 2003, with a reception at Galle Face Hotel which was also the venue of their wedding reception. I too had the opportunity of celebrating my birthday jointly with them this day.
Am Amma was a loving wife to Ber Thaththa and was behind him in all what he did and looked after him well until his death.
Both were loving grand parents not only to me, but also to my two cousins Trishan and Shiran. We enjoyed every moment being together with them.
Even though Ber Thaththa could not see our own children, Am Amma was lucky enough to see five great grandchildren. She was a tower of strength to the family and was admired by all.
Dearest Ber Thaththa and Am Amma, you loved me so much and I always thank Jesus for giving me such loving grand parents. I thank you for all what you have done for me from the day I was born as your eldest grandchild. Both of you will always remain in my mind forever.
In God's care you rest above
while in our hearts you dwell with love
May God Almighty grant peace and eternal rest to their souls

He excelled in whatever he did
A light has gone out without so much as a flicker. All that is left is the precious memory how brightly it burnt and the warmth it gave us while it lasted.
My beloved brother fought a relentless battle for his life with courage and determination for five long years never showing a defeatist attitude but with the help of the medical specialists at his behest to finally succumb to his fate with a giving ministering angel his wife who stood to her task against all odds to see her man through the difficult times and such was her dedication for the cause.
Born on June 16, 1943, Bunny as he was fondly called, was the fifth in a line of siblings of five boys and three girls and the showed early brilliance in his studies and had the distinction of reading for his degree at the University of Peradeniya passing out as a Science Graduate much to our delight and little did he realise that his intended brother-in-law to be Anver Dole was also passing out with an Honours Degree in Chemistry adding more impetus to the families at large.
With a penchant for the uniform and now armed with Degree he then sought enlistment in the Sri Lanka Navy and was the first batch of Graduates to be commissioned as Cadet Officers and later to be commissioned Electrical Officers almost following in the foot steps of his late father who too identified himself as an engineer attached to the then Government Department of Electrical Undertakings.
He along with his batch mates were sent to India for advanced training and they covered themselves with distinction having left an indelible imprint at the Indian Naval Establishments as I.N.S. Shivaji and Lonovla.
A lieutenant by rank, wedding bells were to chime and the lot fell, on me do to the Honours and I stood to my task having first to find his partner and then to see through the ceremony which was to be a service wedding.
My proudest moment came when I had to lead him, keeping steps with him on his ‘Here comes the Groom” march played to the strains by the Navy band in attendance.
It was sheer joy to see the couple ultimately emerging out of a Guard of Honour arranged by his co-officers of the Navy.
With the passage of time with the new arrivals to form a happy family in the making initially with baby Nirfan to be followed with by a bundle of joy Imran brought them immense happiness.
He went on premature retirement and during this period he sought employment as an electrical officer in the distant Midway Islands which was a US Based establishment and was he delighted to be with the Goon Birds to keep him entertained. Indulging in sports to ward off the boredom he was crowned the undisputed Bowling Champ for two consecutive years.
Back to Welisara he had the distinction of establishing the first Naval Artificer Training Institute which today stands testimony to his dedication towards a worthy undertaking.
A voracious reader and a lover of classical music he thus spent his leisure hours most diligently.
He leaves his wife along with his sons and their extended families and the only grand daughter Alina.
Death is not the greatest loss in life the greatest loss in what dies inside us while we live.
Inna Lillahi Wa Inna Ellahi Rajioon.

Lalitha Pathiratne
Loving mother and friend, silent social worker
The second death anniversary of Lalitha Pathiratne fell on September 29, 2016 with much feelings.
Feelings of happiness for the beautiful memories we have of her. Feelings of sadness that she is no more with us to share life's joys and sorrows.
We miss her but we know that she is free from pain now. We remember her as a loving mother and friend and silent social worker with love and gratitude.
She hailed from a distinguished family from Matara. It could be said that there was a place in her magnanimous heart for every person she came in contact with.
She was also respected by one and all for her sympathy, affection and compassion. She was also one who walked among the cream of society but never lost the common touch.
She was of unique calibre. We loved her in life and we will not forget her in death.
Her passing away came as an irreparable loss to all. She was married to Wilmot Gamage of Galle who served in the ports of Colombo and Galle for nearly 30 years.
She was blessed with five children. He eldest son Indika is employed as a manager in Kalutara. He elder daughter Anuradha is married to a businessman of Matara and her younger son Buddhika is also employed as a manager.
I will be failing in my duty if I don't mention her cousin sister Indrani Senanayake who looked after he as a Florence Nightingale during her long illness at her home at Walgama Matara.
May she attain the supreme bliss of Nibbana
Cecil R. Senanayake
