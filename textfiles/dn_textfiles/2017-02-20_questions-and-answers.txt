Questions and answers

Obtaining a passport without Birth Certificate
Question:
My sister, 54, wishes to obtain a passport to go abroad on a pilgrimage. Yet, she doesn’t have a Birth Certificate although she has a valid National Identity Card. She tried to obtain the Birth Certificate by producing the date which appears in her NIC with other information. But she was informed by authorities that they couldn’t trace it after searching their records. What is the procedure to obtain a passport without a Birth Certificate?
M.A.H.M. Waffar
Answer
If your sister has the NIC, it means that she has a Birth Certificate as well. But we have a doubt as to how she prepared a valid NIC without the Birth Certificate. However, if there is no Birth Certificate, you can prepare a Birth Certificate by producing the below documents to the Additional District Registrar where your sister was born.
* Marriage certificate of parents if they are married
* Nil result sheets
* One of the following documents indicating the date and place of birth
o Hospital report or certified copy
o Grama Niladhari report or certified copy
o Estate birth report or certified copy
o Copy of the midwife’s birth register In case of non-possession of any of the above documents, you may produce
o Health development record
o Certificate of baptism
o Certified copy of the school admission register / pupil’s record sheet
o Estate welfare officer’s report
o Horoscope of the record of time prepared on a proximate date to the day on which the birth occurred
If she is unable to produce these documents, she can apply for a proposed age certificate consulting a judicial medical officer.
However, the Birth Certificate is necessary to prepare a Passport.
Information on NIC
Question
My brother filed a partition case in the District Court among family members. My brother has furnished a Transfer Deed executed in 2012 in his favor to the relevant case. The name, address and NIC number of the person who sold this land have been mentioned in the deed. When I searched for the person who sold the land through the GS electoral register, I was informed that no such person resided there since 2010. Is it possible to obtain all information from the Census and Statistics Board regarding this person using his NIC number?
A.C.A. Nisaya - Thulhiriya
Answer
We can’t guarantee that the said person resides at the same address mentioned in the NIC. However, if you think that this transaction is illegal, you can complain to the Fraud Bureau of the Police. You can check the validity of the NIC from the Department of Registration of Persons.
Sri Lankan Passport lost abroad
Question
I have a friend in Japan who is a Sri Lankan. He was planning to visit Sri Lanka this April. However, he had lost his Sri Lankan Passport in Japan. How can he obtain a new passport?
Nadeesha - Maharagama
Answer
Your friend can make a complaint to his local police station in Japan and obtain a police report. He can download a ‘stolen or lost passport complaint form’ from the Sri Lankan Immigration Department website. He has to submit the duly filled complaint form together with the police report to the nearest Sri Lanka Diplomatic or Consular office. The Sri Lankan Diplomatic Mission or Consulate will transmit the details of the stolen or lost passports to the Immigration Department in Sri Lanka. Upon receipt of such information, they will take steps to cancel the stolen, lost or missing passport.
A passport reported lost or stolen can no longer be used for travel. Your friend has to apply for a new passport.
