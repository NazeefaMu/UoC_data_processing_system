Hotel Asia 2017 kicks off in the Maldives

“Over 175 exhibitors are showcasing their products and portfolios covering aspects of the industry and modern security systems and a wide array of hotel supplies,” Chief Judge Alan Palmer said at the opening of Hotel Asia 2017 in the Maldives.
Maldivian Minister of Finance and Treasury Ahmed Munawar said that the event also helps the growth of the country's tourism sector.
He said that today 35% of GDP is generated from the tourism sector in the Maldives and tourism is the key driver of the archipelago's economy.
He said that they have recorded over 700,000 arrivals with over 35% from China and are hopeful to pass the 1.3 million mark by the end of the year. "We also hope for more arrivals from Europe in the future," he said.
“Hotels in Male have been sold out for this period due to the increasing number of visitors and exhibitors for the event and this too shows the potential of the industry. The event is also a meeting place for buyers and sellers to meet and is a very important show for the country's tourism sector development,” he said.
The overriding purpose of the show is to cultivate healthy relationships between hospitality providers, suppliers and the community,” explained Aasim Mukthar, CEO of MECS, the organizers of the event. “The only way to achieve any growth potential is through harmonious relationships in trade and services. Hotel Asia is a platform for counterparts to speak to each other. It is a one stop shop for anyone in the hospitality field.”
The three-day event will introduce a series of seminars and masterclasses in conjunction with the exhibition and culinary challenge.
Hotel Asia is organized by Maldives Exhibition and Conference Services. The event is endorsed and supported by the Ministry of Tourism and Ministry of Economic Development together with the support of the Maldives Chamber of Commerce and Industry, Liveaboard Association of Maldives. Bestbuy Maldives (BBM) continues its support as the main sponsor of the event since its inception.
The Hotel Asia International Culinary Challenge is the region's premier culinary competition which also obtained due recognition and endorsement from the World Association of Chefs’ Societies (Worldchefs - WACS).
The exhibition itself is a tremendous opportunity for resort owners to see new technology, products and services that are available in the market.
