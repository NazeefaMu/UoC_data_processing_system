Minister refutes media reports on shrimp species

Fisheries and Aquatic Resources Development Minister Mahinda Amaraweera yesterday advised the people not to panic over certain newspaper reports on the importation of disease spreading shrimp species.
Addressing the media at the Fisheries Ministry yesterday, Minister Amaraweera while totally refuting these media reports said that people have begun to panic due to some misleading media reports which has resulted in a drop in shrimp prices.
Minister Amaraweera said this situation has also had a drastic impact on shrimp exports. The National Aquaculture Development Authority (NAQDA) has taken measures to introduce a shrimp species, named Pacific White Legged Shrimp (Litopenaeus vannamei) for shrimp farming.
According to NAQDA Chairman Upali Mohotti, the reason for selecting this particular species is the high growth rate. The shrimp species currently used for aquaculture is the tiger shrimp (Penaeus monodon).
“This species had been imported after taking an International Medical Certificate which certified that these species is free from 10 types of diseases,” he added.
