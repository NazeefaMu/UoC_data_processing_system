Drink it straight! : Eternal elegance, contemporary touch

When the young rays of the sun seeps through the cypress leaves to flirt with the dew dappled marigolds, a new day dawns on Abbotsford division, Dessford Estate, Nanu Oya. The lithe, able feet of Lechumi, Mariamma, Laxshmi and Indira fall on the well-worn paths as they begin work on Abbotsford Division, situated a few meters away in the hills beside the Nuwara Eliya Hatton road. As the mist rises from the ground the newly plucked leaves undergo a unique manufacturing process which culminates into a new brand of tea described as a golden brew, a “gourmet-special, guaranteed to give you a taste of the rich heritage of the pioneer planters, taking you back to the peace and serenity of beautiful landscapes, horse-drawn carriages, and raindrops on English roses.’
The innovator of this unique tea, Nishantha Abeysinghe and his team on Dessford Estate, of Talawakelle Tea Estates Limited are the winners of the Hayley’s Chairman’s Award, - Plantation Sector, 2017. Aiming to transform the conventional process of manufacturing Ceylon tea - and then remake the existing tea culture of not only Sri Lanka but the whole world, one cup at a time, Nishantha Abeysinghe hopes to herald the beginning of a new era in this challenging times in the tea industry of Sri Lanka through his invention. Daily News joined the inventor in his office in the hills of Nanu Oya to discuss innovation, his hopes for the future and his favorite cup of tea.
Q: Most inventions are eureka moments. Even the very first cup of tea came about accidentally when some leaves fell into a pot of boiling water in ancient China. How did the discovery of Abbotsford Special happen?
A: Actually it wasn’t something that happened in a flash or accidentally. It wasn’t like the apple falling on Newton’s head. It was pure curiosity at first that led me to explore the possibilities of making a brand of tea that is different to what is available in the market. It all started in the kitchen of the planter’s bungalow I live in, where most of the trials were done using clay pots and pans and the oven hitherto used only for baking cakes. My intention was to try and make a sweeter tea than the world famous Darjeeling or Chinese Keemun.
Q: How long did it take to create the premium brew you were looking for?
A: I experimented for over three years. There was this old seedling tea plot close to my bungalow which apparently was planted by A. Ferguson in the 1870s. I selected this field because these tea bushes are about 140 years old and they produce some of the most flavoured buds ever known. Whenever I had some free time along with my wife and daughter we used to go to this field with a basket and pick the tiny buds. Then back home in our bungalow’s kitchen we carefully steam rolled the leaves and sun dried them. It took many trials and errors however, before we could come up with something that satisfied me. From the kitchen we progressed to the factory with a few miniature tea processing machines.
Q: What is unique about this new brand of tea?
A: What is amazing is the liqueur characteristics that developed from these ancient leaves subjected to a unique and modern manufacturing process. This tea is a marvelous blend of the 19th century and the present. It has a very smooth delicate floral taste that is different to any of the other brands of tea we have known till now.
Q: Can you explain the innovative method used in manufacturing this special brand?
A: The initial trials motivated me to explore the idea of producing tea that is different to black and green tea commonly available in the market. Black tea that all of us are familiar with, is fully fermented during the manufacturing process. When the tea is fully fermented the brew is reddish in color and strong in liqueur characteristics. Green tea which is fast becoming popular here in Sri Lanka is produced without any fermentation ‘light in the cup’. The tea I have called Abbotsford Special falls in between these two extremes.
Q: What is the motivation behind this invention and what are the challenges you see in the future?
A: This year we celebrate 150 years of Ceylon tea. But the industry has not changed much in terms of value creation. We have not moved beyond the traditional manufacturing processes. It is time to think beyond traditions and create tea products that appeal to the modern consumers who are ready for a new experience in tea.
Q: Who were the guiding force behind your new endeavor?
A: All this would not have been possible without the assistance of the Managing Director of Talawakelle tea estates Roshan Rajadurai, CEO, Dilantha Senevirantne and DCEO Lalith Munasinghe for taking the leadership in creating a culture of innovation at Talawakelle Tea Estates PLC. They have always encouraged, financed and recognized new ventures all in the name of preserving this cherished drink for generations to come. I must also thank my team on Dessford Estate, Dilory Manohar, Asaba Kodagoda, Mohamed Fawzer, Madhawa Wickramaratne and all the rest of my staff and workers who supported me in various ways.
Q: What advice would you give to other innovators, especially those in the tea sector?
A: If you truly want to make a contribution as a planter, you can’t sit on the sidelines waiting till the weather or the market prices change. It is still not too late to look beyond traditions in managing tea estates. There are plenty of opportunities on estates to be exploited. Believe in your dreams, believe in your ability to make them come true. If at first you fail, keep on trying. Success is always within your reach.
Q: Finally, what is the best way to get the most out of a cup of premium Ceylon tea?
A: Drink it straight. No sugar, no milk.
