Rs.14 m worth pure heroin seized from flight toilet

Customs Department Officials yesterday seized Rs.14 million worth pure heroin from a flight that stopped over at the Bandaranaike International Airport, Katunayake last morning. The heroin haul weighed 1.3 kg.
The detection helped to reveal an international drug trafficking scheme. The raid was carried out in Fly Dubai flight FZ 555, which was flying from Male to Dubai, when it stopped over at Katunayake.
Deputy Customs Director Parakrama Basnayake said four packets of heroin had been found inside the flight toilet and the flight crew informed about it to the Customs officers.
Preliminary investigations have found that an air hostess had first detected the suspicious parcel and informed the pilot.
The Deputy Customs Director said the flight crew members extended their full support to the investigations. The plane departed to its destination at around 6.51 a.m. after a five hour delay.
After the Customs investigations, the heroin haul is to be handed over to the Police Narcotics Bureau.
