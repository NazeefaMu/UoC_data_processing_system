‘Trafficker’ Brit woman had helped two Sri Lankan’s fly to UK with false passports

A British woman, arrested with three other UK nationals in a case of alleged human trafficking, had helped two Sri Lankans fly to the UK with fake passports in January.
Police said that Julie Ann Warner (36), a tourist guide, had confessed that she became a carrier after meeting a Sri Lankan agent, Logorajan, six months ago.
Warner and three other Britishers were arrested at Sahar airport on March 15 for allegedly helping four Lankans migrate to the UK, using forged passports.
Senior inspector of Sahar Police station, BT Mukhedkar, said that the UK nationals were "not cooperating" in the probe.
The police said that agents wanted in the case had demanded Rs17 lakhs each from the Lankans to help them reach the UK with fake passports which identified them as the four arrested UK nationals.
The Lankans, on reaching the UK, planned to surrender before the authorities and claim that they had flown there due to a threat to their lives from Lankan Tigers and hoped "to get political asylum there".
Public prosecutor Neeta Masarkar said that the fake Indian passports had fake immigration stamps. Counsel for the British nationals, Prabhakar Tripathi, said that his clients were victims as the agents had duped them.
