The Russian Centre in Colombo will present “Russian Classical Ballet in Colombo”- two days of dance-filled performances by an acclaimed troupe of Russian ballerinas- at Nelum Pokuna on March 30 and 31.
While engaging in enhancing the quality of society through cultural activities, the Cultural Section of the Embassy of the Russian Federation in Sri Lanka has been a well known organization of influence for the close-knit relationship between the two countries.
As a result, of this steady friendship, the Cultural Centre invites all citizens to join hands in celebrating the occasion of 60 Years of Diplomatic Relationship between Sri Lanka and Russia at Nelum Pokuna, in the midst of an array of performances that will be staged as fragments from some of the world famous Ballets; Swan Lake, Giselle, Corsair, Sylphide, Cinderella, along with romantic duets and choreographic miniatures like Sri Lanka has never witnessed before.
Dating back to the 18th century, Russia began to adapt to the art of Ballet with the formation of the Royal Danish Ballet and the Imperial Ballet of the Russian Empire. Since then, Ballet has been of paramount importance for Russian Culture.
While this form of dance entered Russia through the influence of Western culture, it was not until the realm of Empress Anna that Russian Ballet was founded by Jean-Baptiste Landé, who was the ballet master at a military academy founded by her.
Enriching its society with the finest of art, Russia became home to some of the most notable Ballerinas in the history of theatre. The Nutcracker, Swan Lake, Cinderella and the Sleeping Beauty are known to be some of the most momentous Russian Ballets in history.
Gaining an opportunity to witness the magical moves of these Ballerinas that leave you bewildered is an occasional fortuity, and Sri Lanka is once again fortunate to welcome the creative team of Russian Chamber Ballet under the direction of Natalia Permiakova to Colombo in the month of March.
Natalia Permiakova, the Head of the Classical Department of the Boris Eifman Academy of Dance in St. Petersburg is a graduate of the Academy of Russian Ballet and holds a Ph.D. in Pedagogical Sciences. She was the head choreographer of the classical Ballet, “Gzhel” at the Moscow State Academic Dance Theatre.
“Natalia Permiakova, her devoted troupe of youngsters along with the Russian Centre cordially invite all readers to become a part of an enchanting experience that can be cherished for a lifetime as the ballerinas begin to dream on their feet, defying gravity and lifting the art of ballet to a whole new level,” states the Russian Cultural Centre in a press release.
