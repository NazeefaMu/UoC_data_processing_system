All scoring for Sri Lanka was done by Kandy SC players Danushka Ranjan and Richard Dharmapala, a try each and Thilina Wijesinghe who made the conversions and put over the penalties.

Sri Lanka has lost once against the Philippines Volcanoes in 2012 in a crucial game that prevented them from gaining promotion to the top division.
