DHADAK cobwelebs of TRUTHS

The much speculated entrance of former Bollywood Superstar – the late Sridevi’s daughter Janhvi Kapoor’s film ‘Dhadak’ may not be a magnum opus but it does not fail to captivate hearts due it its vibe for innocence and freshness.
The film also brings one-film-old Ishaan Khatter to the limelight as Janhvi’s love interest. Ishaan had proven his potentials as an actor in ‘Beyond the Clouds’ and he is able to highlight his acting talents further through ‘Dhadak’.
Originally inspired by Nagraj Manjule’s ‘Sairat’ the story goes along the stereotype Bollywood storyline of boy meets girl, love blossoms and they have to be on the run to shield their love from the cruel world. However it takes a novel twist once the young couple has to settle down in an apartment with minimal facilities and have to work hard to make a living. Unlike Ishaan’s Madhukar, Janhvi’s Parthavi is from the elite class and used to having luxuries delivered to her doorstep. However unlike the typical spoilt brat, she is down to earth and though she faces many difficulties which are alien to her, she suffers silently but manages to win against the odds.
Though Parthavi and Madhukar encounter several instances in which they misunderstand each other, they manage to get over these instances and act like mature adults. They manage to save up for a decent living, have a child and even get promoted for their hard work. However unlike Madhukar, Parthavi still has an innocent outlook towards the world. She pines for her family and believes that all is forgotten and forgiven as time lapses. She does not heed Madhukar’s words when he says that he does not trust them and allows her bother and his friends to visit them in their housewarming ceremony to their new home. However she has to pay a bitter price for her naive quality. Shashank Khaitan has handled the ‘Dhadak’ storyline in the best possible manner. He has worked upon its strengths like playing upon the innocence of the lovers and making the best of the fresh pairing. This is his third film and there are instances which we can reflect back to his previous creations.
Touching upon the deep rooted prejudices in life ‘Dhadak’ brings forth several realities in life which has been camouflaged by wealth and status.
On the downside there are a few instances in which some scenes look unbelievable. For instance though the young couple is forced to work and live in situations while trying to make ends meet, they still manage to look their best.
Taking performances into consideration Ishaan seems like a beacon of hope for Bollywood. He displays the zest of a star in the making with his dramatic performances and expressive eyes. Janhvi looks beautiful and playful in the scenes. She has inherited her mother’s charm as a Bollywood heroine.
However the greatest strength of the film is probably in its climax. It is not only heart wrenching but also leaves many questions in the viewers minds as it leaves a big question mark towards the end of the story.
