Donna  star Streep reveals her reaction  to sequel

‘Mamma Mia: Here We Go Again’ features significantly less Meryl Streep than its predecessor - but it hasn’t stopped the actress enjoying every second of it.
Despite her character being killed-off off-screen, Streep revealed that she is a huge fan of the sequel.
Talking about her reaction to seeing the movie, she beamed that she hopes the audience has the exact same response.
“I just hope they [fans] get the feeling I got two nights ago, which is elated.
“I want them to come out as happy as I was when I saw it, because I think delivering happiness is something that’s very rare in this world.
“And the fact that this gang of people came together to do it…
“If we deliver joy, that’s all I ask.”
The multiple award-winner also heaped praise on co-star Amanda Seyfried, who plays her daughter Sophie.
“I think Amanda brings something to this particular incarnation of Mamma Mia that’s very special,” she said.
“She’s the heartbeat of the film. Her emotion carries the whole story forward and she really moved me.
“I think she’s magic. Plus, she’s got a cracking voice and she gets to use it more in this one.” One of the two songs Streep sings on in the sequel is Super Trouper - which, it has been revealed, was only added at the last minute.
Producer Judy Craymer explained that bosses were scrambling to figure out a song to serve as the finale, after ABBA vetoed another reprise of Dancing Queen.
