Aussies didn’t have  a plan against  spin – Herath

 
Man of the Match and Man of the Series Rangana Herath said that the Australians didn’t have a plan for the spinners in the series and that he was not surprised they lost.
“After 2011 this is the first time they have come here. They have played only ten Tests in Asia since then. They play a lot in their conditions. They have to have a better plan to play spin. I thought they didn't have a plan for the spinners in this series,” said Herath who bagged a mountain of wickets finishing with a rich haul of 28 at a cost of only 12.75.
“To take 28 wickets against the world's number one ranked team is a massive thing. The most wickets I have taken in a series as well. It feels great.
“I have played six series against Australia. Except for one series where I was a substitute, we have lost all other series. Even in this series they are the number one ranked team but we were confident about our ability. With the starts Kusal (Mendis) gave us we had our confidence sky high. This is a huge win. I don't think that we ever imagined that we could achieve a 3-0 whitewash,” he said.
Herath said that there was nothing special about his bowling that confused the Aussies.
“Because of the injury (groin), I had to vary a few things but nothing other than usual. The first two games I was going well but this game was tough. As Angelo said there are certain things you have to put through pain. All the players in the team contributed, that's the reason for us to win.” – ST
