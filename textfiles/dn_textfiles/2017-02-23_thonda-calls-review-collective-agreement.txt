Thonda calls for review of collective agreement

The collective agreement that was signed between the estate workers trade unions and the estate owners has to be reviewed, Ceylon Workers’ Congress Leader MP Arumugam Thondaman said. “The joint agreement has to be reviewed as the estate owners have failed to adhere to the terms and conditions of the agreement,”he said.
Addressing the media yesterday at the Ceylon Workers Congress(CWC) headquarters in Colombo, MP Thondman said that the estate workers do not receive the guaranteed wage according to the new agreement. “The estate owners have violated the collective agreement,” he claimed. He further said that they have written to the Labour and Trade Union Relations and added that the ministry responded that they will arrange a meeting after March 5. “While taking initiatives to have discussions with the ministry, we are also taking measures to take legal action against the estate owners for violating the terms and conditions of the agreement,” he said.
