Rice samples out of danger

Rumours on plastic rice:
The Rice Research and Development Institute (RRDI) in Bathalagoda and Industrial Technology Institute (ITI) in Colombo have certified that the rice samples checked by them were normal and safe for consumption, Consumer Affairs Authority (CAA) Director Chandrika Thilakaratne said.
The RRDI and ITI on Wednesday released the reports of the laboratory tests they carried out on the rice samples sent by the CAA in the wake of a plastic rice controversy.
Addressing the media in Colombo yesterday, she said the two prominent research institutes have certified that all the samples were “natural” and “do not contain any plastic or artificial grains”.
“As rumours on plastic rice spread in social media, the CAA received public complaints. We collected samples from each of them. The Disaster Management Ministry too requested to test the rice it received. All these samples were sent to laboratory tests,” the CAA Director said.
