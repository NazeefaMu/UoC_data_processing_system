Homemade Treatments  for Radiant Skin

Grape Anti-WrinkleCleanser 
Grapes have natural exfoliation benefits. Grapeseed oil can be found in many anti-aging skin care products.
The grape is also high in antioxidants and vitamins.The alpha-hydroxy acid (AHA) found in grapes and other acid fruits such as oranges, lemons, and strawberries, help to reduce wrinkles and sun damage.
Though the levels of AHA in natural fruits aren’t as high as in cosmetic products, if used regularly you should notice improvements in your skin.
The yogurt in the this recipe is a good source of vitamin A retinol and vitamin B5.
The olive oil is high in vitamin E and is great for moisturizing that results in soft and supple skin.
The baking soda adds a little extra exfoliation.
 
Grape Anti-Wrinkle Cleanser 
 
Blend 1/2 cup grapes, 1 tsp olive oil, 1/4 cup yogurt and 1 tbsp baking soda in a blender until smooth. Gently massage onto face and rinse with warm water.

You can also receive the anti-wrinkle benefits from grapes by slicing a few in half and then crushing them gently on your face. Leave on for about 20 minutes.

Avocado and Honey Face Mask 
Use this mask if you want soft, supple, moisturized, and glowing skin.
Avocado is truly a super-fruit. When you’re not wearing it, I highly recommend eating it. It is high in healthy fats, fiber, vitamins and antioxidants. There have been studies showing that people who eat avocado have lower cholesterol[1]. But, more specifically, how does it benefit your skin? Well, it’s high in vitamin E, which is great for softening, reducing wrinkles, and improving the appearance of stretch marks. It also has antioxidant properties. It boosts collagen (which maintains elasticity) and new skin growth. Along with vitamin E, avocado is also high in vitamin A and C.Avocado is also extremely high in omega fats, which improve dryness and firmness. All the oils and fat in avocados will provide your skin with natural moisture and elasticity.
Honey helps to absorb and retain moisture. Honey is naturally anti-microbial and also an antioxidant. It will help to absorb impurities.
How to make it: 
 
Mash 1 ripe avocado with 2 tbsp honey. Apply liberally to face and allow to sit for 20-30 minutes. Apply two cool cucumber slices to eyes, which help reduce redness and puffiness, if desired.
Use whenever you feel your skin is in need of replenishment and moisturization.
 
Honey and Cucuber Toner 
 
Cucumber helps to soothe and soften your skin. It is anti-inflammatory and naturally refreshing. It will reduce redness, puffiness, and help even out your skin tone.
Honey, again, is great for absorbing impurities from the pores. It also helps treat minor irritations and sun burns.
Use this toner twice daily to help clean and moisturize your skin.
 
How to make it: 
Peel 2 cucumbers.
Blend. Strain and collect the cucumber juice.
Mix 1 tbsp honey into the cucumber juice.
Apply small amount with fingers or dab with a cotton ball. Store up to a week in the refrigerator.
