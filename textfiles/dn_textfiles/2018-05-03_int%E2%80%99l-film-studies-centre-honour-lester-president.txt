Int’l film studies centre to honour Lester - President

The nation is in mourning for a great man who shaped an era, said President Maithripala Sirisena yesterday as he addressed the state funeral of late Dr Lester James Peries yesterday.
“I spoke to Dr. Lester James Peries last when I visited his house on his birthday two weeks ago”. He was a man who succeeded in portraying Sinhalese culture, society and the rural landscape of the country to the world through cinema,” the President said.
He added that whilst it was the norm for people to be known by their country, Sri Lanka came to be known through Dr. Peries.
“As a government we decided to have his final rites with state honours and declare today a day of mourning as an honour to his vision and humanitarianism”.
The President further said that the great artiste was a pioneer in teaching both local and international cinema ways of connecting the environment to the people.
As he expressed the government’s and the nations’ sympathies to Dr Peries’ wife and family, he asked that all in the field of local cinema come together to build on the vision and intelligence of the late Dr Peries to take Sri Lankan cinema forward. The President also heeded to the request made by Prof. Sunil Ariyaratne to help build an international film studies centre dedicated to the late veteran.
He added that while it was the norm for people to be known by their country, Sri Lanka came to be known through Dr Peries .
