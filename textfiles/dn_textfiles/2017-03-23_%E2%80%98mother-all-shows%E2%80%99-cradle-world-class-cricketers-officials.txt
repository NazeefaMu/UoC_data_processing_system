‘Mother of all Shows’, cradle of world class cricketers, officials

The Observer-Mobitel Schoolboy Cricketer of the Year mega event has not only produced champion cricketers but has also given birth to the top most officials in the game - ICC elite panel umpires, ICC match referees, including the chief match referee and even international level coaches.
Knowing how valuable this title is and its potential to produce legendary cricketers, the dream of every schoolboy cricketer is to win this prestigious award, if not any other major title at the mega show.
With the 2016/17 inter-school first X1 season gradually reaching towards its last few weeks, the race for the Observer-Mobitel Most Popular Schoolboy Cricketer of the Year titles has become extremely competitive. There has been heavy voting for the Observer-Mobitel Most Popular Schoolboy Cricketer of the Year contests, conducted under three divisions.
Old boys, present boys and their supporters have joined hands in voting for the outstanding schoolboy cricketers from their alma mater. That has made these contests extremely competitive and it’s hard to make any prediction at this stage.
Interestingly, two former Observer-Mobitel Schoolboy Cricketer of the Year award winners – Dinesh Chandimal and Kusal Mendis made Sri Lanka proud with two blistering centuries in the back to back Tests in the recent home series against Bangladesh.
Mendis, the winner of the prestigious Observer-Mobitel Schoolboy Cricketer of the Year title in 2013 as a star batsman from Prince of Wales College, Moratuwa, anchored Sri Lanka batting when the hosts won the first Test against Bangladesh by 256 runs in Galle. Mendis had a marathon innings of 194. In the second Test of the same series, another former Observer-Mobitel Schoolboy Cricketer of the Year award winner made his presence felt at Saravanamuttu Stadium. Vice aptain Dinesh Chandimal, who had won the Observer-Mobitel Schoolboy Cricketer of the Year ‘crown’ in 2009, regained his form with an exemplary century.
He walked into the middle when Sri Lanka was reeling at 24 for 2 after electing to bat first. Coming to bat at difficult time, Chandimal kept his cool and faced 300 balls in a courageous effort to give Sri Lanka a respectable total. Sri Lanka was reduced to 136 for 5 at one stage.
Although the wickets tumbled at the other end, Chandimal was a tower of strength, selecting only the bad deliveries to go for his strokes. He had one six and ten fours in a responsible innings that helped Sri Lanka to recover partially. It was one of his slowest innings in Tests with a strike rate of only 46.00.
Speaking after the match, Chandimal rated it as the best out of his eight Test centuries. He was the ninth batsman to depart in the home team’s first innings but by then, Sri Lanka had managed to go pass 300-run mark.
Chandimal’s return to form came at a crucial juncture - both to his team as well as for the stylist cricketer personally. Chandimal’s willow started talking again when his team desperately needed big contribution from him. He had a majestic knock of 138 runs scored through four sessions.
Chandimal is one of the several Sri Lanka star cricketers produced by Ananda College, Colombo which has been a breeding shade for outstanding young cricketers. The galaxy of the Sri Lanka national players produced by Ananda is headed by Sri Lanka’s world cup-winning captain Arjuna Ranatunga.
Incidentally, Ranatunga is also a proud recipient of the prestigious Observer Schoolboy Cricketer of the Year award, having won the title twice in 1980 and 1982. Beside Ranatunga and Chandimal, among the other notable Anandians who had won the Observer Schoolboy Cricketer of the Year title are former Sri Lanka captain Marvan Atapattu (1990), Sanjeewa Ranatunga (1988), former Sri Lanka cricketers Thilan Samaraweera (1994 and 1995) and Muthumudalige Pushpakumara (1999).
Interestingly, two former Observer Schoolboy Cricketer of the Year main title winners are playing key roles as officials in the respective sides during the current Sri Lanka-Bangladesh series. The winner of the coveted award in 1985, Asanga Gurusinha joined the Lankan team as cricket manager from early this month while another Lankan serving as the batting coach of the visiting Bangladesh team Thilan Samaraweera.
Samaraweera, who had the rare honour of winning the Observer Schoolboy Cricketer of the Year title twice, has sharpen the skills of the Bangladesh batsmen who gave a torrid time to the Lankan bowlers last Friday.
After making only 312 and 197 all out in the respective innings of the first Test, the Bangladesh batsmen came out with a vastly improved performance in the second Test to make 467 all out that enabled to win by four wickets – their first Test win ever against Sri Lanka. Full credit should go to former Observer Schoolboy Cricketer turned coach Samaraweera who has done a wonderful job.
The ‘Mother of all Shows’ has not only produced great cricketers who had conquered Mount Everest in world cricket but also engraved their names as great officials.
The first recipient of the prestigious Observer Schoolboy Cricketer of the Year award Ranjan Madugalle continues to play his key role as the Chief ICC Match Referee while another award winner Kumar Dharmasena went on to join the ICC’s elite panel of umpires.
Sri Lanka’s 1996 world cup star Roshan Mahanama, who had joined the select band of cricketers who had won the Observer Schoolboy Cricketer of the Year title twice (1983 and 1984) too had served as an ICC Match Referee.
Incidentally, current chairman of selectors Sanath Jayasuriya too had won the Observer Schoolboy Cricketer of the Year (Outstation) title in 1988 during his school career at St. Servetus College, Matara.
