KANDY SPORTS ROUND UP
74th Bradby 1st leg - who will emerge victorious?

The most sought after rugby possession in the school arena, the Bradby Shield encounter between Trinity College ‘Lions’ and Royal College ‘Elephants’ 1st leg is today in what promises to be an entertaining affair at Royal Complex. This is one of the most looked forward Schools rugby encounters, since 1920. The shield was introduced in 1945, and out of the 73 Bradby games Trinity has 39 wins, Royal 32 and 2 tied. Today much will depend on the performance of experienced players of the two teams, from whom much will be expected to take on a leading role from their starting line-up. Although this is not Trinity’s strongest side, they will not lack motivation for this match after they suffered two rare defeats.
They will also be keen to get the better of their opponents, which will be a difficult one. Royal is playing good quality rugby and playing as a team. They have become worthy winners against whomever they have played. The Bradby game however always turns out to be extraordinary as over the years these games have been very much a carnival atmosphere with both present and old boys gathering to rejoice and go down memory lane.
