My word! : They’re really walking their pet bird!

Walking the dog is a normal scene anywhere in the world. But when was the last time you saw a bird being taken for a stroll? And don’t dismiss my story by asking me to go tell it to the birds, because it’s true.
While you probably take your pet walking at least to relieve itself, you may have overlooked how valuable exercise can also be to your pet’s health. There are places where certain unusual pets taken for a constitutional are not the furry canines but those of the feathered kind.
In Hong Kong for instance, it’s not only the dogs that get aired and walked. It’s the birds! When I was new to the territory the sight of men walking their birds was so astonishing that you could have knocked me down with a feather when I first observed the phenomenon.
The owners themselves are queer birds of a feather, because they are all die-hard enthusiasts with one interest in common. Yet I may rightly describe myself as a bird of passage bearing in mind my many work experiences abroad as a scribbler in diverse capitals of the world. Yes, I concede I have been a sort of journeyman journalist in various parts of the Asian region, which makes me a migratory ‘bird’.
You see, the good thing about my wandering work experience had helped me adjust and adapt admirably to many unfamiliar customs and environments, where certain other expatriates have suffered anxiety that has led to culture shock. Personally speaking, I have found the situations adventuresome, funny and intriguing.
In Hong Kong and China, men are famous for walking their pet birds in the early morning. Men, both young and old - but mostly old - walk while gently swinging the birdcages, all covered with black or white cloth. Early in the morning on sunny days you’ll see them, flocks of geriatric men shuffling towards local parks and green spaces.
Sorry to disappoint you girls, but the avian aficionados and their charges are all of the masculine gender. Like their owners, all of the birds are male. That’s because they are the only ones who sing. In the wild, their voice helps them display bravado against their rivals as they hopefully serenade to win the heart of a prized mate.
Most of the birdmen are over 60 years of age carrying one or more cloth covered cages. A particularly large group converge like a secret club. With ritualistic intensity, each member carefully scans the tree branches, looking for a prime spot to hang their cage. Once hung, the man will uncover his ward and song immediately bursts forth. By 9 am, hundreds of bamboo cages clutter the trees, their trilling din reaching a cacophonous crescendo.
They may be pampered pets in beautifully gilded metal or ornate bamboo cages but the fact remains that they are jailbirds nonetheless. The hackneyed phrase ‘As free as a bird’ is not their lot, although they are cosseted with kindness and spoiled rotten. To earn their keep all they have to do is sing for their supper while their owners listen to their full-throated recital in mesmerised absorption. In birdmen’s lore to own a rara-avis is a badge of honour among the fraternity.
That is why these cage-swinging oldsters with their prized charges come into the birding rendezvous with a spring in their step and a hint of a swagger. Talk about fiercely proud bird owners being transformed from debilitated dodderers to animated cock-a-hoop showmen. It’s hard to imagine how a tiny feathered creature could turn a senile shuffler into an assertive strutting cock-of-the walk human.
Most of the birds you’ll see during these gatherings are Chinese thrush, or ‘Huamei’ which means blackened or painted eyebrows. They can’t be taught to speak, but their singing voice is considered the sweetest. A popular haunt for songbird supporters, the visually engaging Yuen Po Street Bird Garden is designed in the style of a traditional Chinese garden. The park has dozens of stalls selling exotic birds, beautifully crafted bamboo cages, porcelain water dishes and other bird-care paraphernalia.
While it’s unlikely that you’ll be purchasing a few Chinese thrushes or skylarks as mementos of your Hong Kong trip, the garden is a pleasant place to witness this age-old Chinese hobby in action, where birdmen feed and preen their feathered friends in exchange for sweet songs.
Their birds hop and chirp inside their decorative cages, some playing ‘beak-a-boo’ with their jailbird neighbours. However there is a unique pecking order in the choice of avian varieties among these enthusiasts. While their counterparts in the rest of the world would plump for attractive plumage the Chinese bird buffs are not usually enamoured by typical ornamental varieties.
They rather have their eyes peeled and ears tuned on songbirds which are the more highly prized for their vocal ability. Whether a songbird is good or not is decided by their song quality, not feather colour. Basically it’s the songbirds which actually rule the roost even though they might not be much to ogle at.
Further on, past the Flower Market, bird fanciers use chopsticks to feed live crickets to pets at the Bird Garden. Lovebirds and nightingales are among the many caged birds - some are for sale, others are along for a companionable squawk.
A newspaper I worked for in the then British territory carried some unusual footage of an elderly man walking down the street – with his pet bird. The man, who uses what looks like a folded-up chair for support, shuffles down the street with the little bird following closely behind. His feathered friend even stops with his owner at a crossing to wait for the pedestrian green light.
The peculiarity of the scene is not lost on other pedestrians, who watch in amazement as the elderly gentleman and his small companion amble along. At one point a woman even stops the man to take a picture. We even received a good many comments about the phenomenon such as: ‘‘What kind of a dog is that?’’ and ‘‘Must be his wing man!’’ And another witty one-liner: ‘‘The guy’s a chick magnet!’’
And I’m not squawking about that Brit slang term ‘Bird’ for a cute member of the human feminine species. Meaning the type of ‘bird’ you link arms with while taking a lovey-dovey moonlight walk. No, and it’s not the type of bird-watching that involves the use of binoculars or telescopes for prurient or non-ornithological purposes.
That, as you must be well aware, is a pastime which typically consists of men who take an inordinate delight in surreptitiously ogling women who are busy getting undressed, taking a shower or indulging in a bit of private hanky-panky.
