Kodak Alaris, Ninehearts  sponsor 4th CIO Forum

Computer Society of Sri Lanka (CSSL) and Federation of Information Technology Industry Sri Lanka (FITIS) will jointly host the 4th CIO Forum on the important topic of “Information Management”.
Kodak Alaris along with their local partner, Ninehearts Imaging, have stepped up to sponsor the event.
Information management concerns a cycle of organizational activity including acquisition, processing, storage and distribution of information.
The challenges that organizations face today ranges across the spectrum; from capturing the chaos of multiple information sources such as email, paper, social media feeds, mobile messaging apps, etc., to processing and deriving meaningful information, to ensuring that it is viewed and addressed by the right personnel within an acceptable timeframe.
By 2020, there will be enough data created each year to fill 11 trillion DVDs, with 90% of it being unstructured.
The struggle among businesses to extract meaningful information from this data is universal. The 4th CIO forum is expected to address the challenges of information management and discuss the possible solutions to tackle this scenario in the future.
The CIO Forum is a platform for CIO’s (or Head’ of IT) and relevant CXO's to deliberate these issues and offer insights with the help of expert practitioners. This dialogue will highlight innovations and disruptions taking place in business and elucidate how these trends will shape the future.
The CIO Forum is also a great networking platform for the CIO community and industry experts. The 4th CIO forum will be held on March 1, at the Kingsbury Hotel, Colombo and will be free of cost to participants. For more information and to register, please visit www.cio.lk
Kodak Alaris products sold through their Distributor Ninehearts Imaging are the market leader in Sri Lanka for high speed document scanners.
