Agriculture Sector Modernization Project to boost rural sector - PM

The government has initiated the Agriculture Sector Modernization Project which would develop the rural sector and modernise the country’s economy as a whole. The World Bank has granted USD 102 million for this purpose,Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said yesterday.
The Prime Minister made this observation at the agreement signing ceremony of the Agriculture Sector Modernization Project where 39 local entrepreneurs who were qualified to receive the matching grant scheme of the Value Chain Development Programme entered into agreements with the World Bank. The event was held at the Waters Edge in Battaramulla.
Prime Minister Wickremesinghe said this was just the beginning and their support would be extended to the development, manufacturing, service, agriculture and fisheries sectors etc.
He said that the rural economy has suffered a decline due to the fact that the youth have deviated from the agriculture sector.
The Premier also said that the agriculture sector has been modernised.
“For example, the United States, China, Thailand and Malaysia have modernised their agriculture sectors,” the Premier said.
“Hence, they had increased the harvest, reduced the cost while adding value,”the Prime Minister said.
He also said the government is taking measures to develop the rural sector in order to strengthen the economy as a whole.
“As a result, the exports have increased together with foreign investment,” Premier Wickremesinghe said.
“The country recorded its highest exports and foreign investment to the private sector in 2017,” the Prime Minister said.
He added that the country has to pay USD 2,500 million annually for the loans that were obtained by the previous regime. The Prime Minister also said that although the revenue of the country was not sufficiet to settle the loans when the Good Governance government came to power, it has been able to pay the loans and utilise money for the country’s development.
Prime Minister Wickremesinghe said that if the rural sector is not developed, the youth would leave the village and come to the City for better prospects.
“The Government plans to allocate a plot of land to the youth who are deprived of lands,” the Premier said. “The youth would then have the land as well as an income,” he said.
Social Welfare and Primary Industries Minister Daya Gamage also spoke on the occasion.
Minister Gayantha Karunathilake, Deputy Minister Anoma Gamage, World Bank Country Director Ms Idah Pswarayi-Riddihough, World Bank Program Leader and Task Leader Andrew D.Goodland were also present on the occasion.
