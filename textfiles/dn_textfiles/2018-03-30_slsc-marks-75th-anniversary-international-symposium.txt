SLSC marks 75th anniversary with international symposium

A multifaceted showpiece of advanced Information Communication Technology (ICT) and the professionalism on cyber space the Sri Lanka Signal Corps (SLSC) of the Army possesses, will remain open to the world when the SLSC marks its 75th anniversary with a well-timed international symposium, themed, 'Cyber Space; Perpetual Battlefront for Future' and the mega 'Wave' ICT Exhibition at the BMICH premises during November 28-29.
A media conference to announce the SLSC 75th anniversary commemoration arrangements, headed by Army Commander Lieutenant General Mahesh Senanayake, took place this afternoon (28) at Hotel Hilton, flanked by Director General, Directorate of Research Analysis Project and Development Major General Renuka Rowel (Rtd), Colonel Commandant SLSC Major General Ajith Wijesinghe, Director Information Technology Brigadier Prabath Dematampitiya and several other senior officers.
Making another distinguished landmark shift in the Army's stance from its conventional 'Threat-based' perception to that of a 'Capacity-based' one, Lieutenant General Mahesh Senanayake attending the media meet as the Chief Guest said that the SLSC could take the lead in propagating new innovative improvements to the cyber space as the latest technologically-advanced 6th dimension of war, unlike in past warfares with land, naval or air troops, etc.
"It is clear that changes in warfare are of different nature and Sri Lanka, though small in size should be prepared to take any challenge in cyber space which is also a form of soft power. Security to information, transmission of information, sensitive information is getting more and more prominence day by day. Hence unlike in the past we have to always mould an Army, based on 'capacity' rather than the 'threat' since Information Technology is ruling the day as the most powerful communicative tool. Media too can contribute to this awareness and the importance of technology," the Commander said.
Colonel Commandant, SLSC Major General Ajith Wijesinghe, making the inaugural contribution to the conference told that the SLSC as the IT and communication arm of the Army is now well structured and technologically poised to take on any future challenge in cyber space, warfare or IT as the country's trailblazer in the field of signals.
"As a descendent of the Royal Signals Corps under the British in 1943, the SLSC being one of the oldest regiments had done a landmark service to the nation very silently, particularly during the times of internal threats and insurgencies. It is now a highly intergrated organization extending from communication to IT, and then to cyber having seven Field Signal Regiments, two IT Regiments, one Repair and Maintenance Regiment, one Cyber Security Regiment, one Electronic Warfare Squadron and School of Signals Training. The SLSC is now poised to take on the challenges in Command, Control, Communication, Computer, Cyber and Intelligence (C51) in the new millennium since the cyber space is the perpetual battlefront for future", Major General Wijesinghe said.
Lieutenant General Mahesh Senanayake, on the same occasion launched the 75th anniversary official logo and the anniversary website. Special tokens of appreciations were also presented to the main sponsors of anniversary events, the symposium and the exhibition.
A considerable number of military and civil ICT professionals at international level have been invited to the ICT symposium and representatives from England, Russia, China, India, Pakistan and Bangladesh have already confirmed their participation, the media gathering was told.
This inaugural discourse for intellectual brainstorming, designed to discuss a diverse range of ICT issues, will pave the way for the Army to further enhance Army's ICT and Cyber capabilities, realizing the potentials at international levels.
The two-day symposium namely the: ‘WAVE’ would focus on "Cyber Space; Perpetual Battlefront for Future", and will consist of several sessions (November 28-29) at the BMICH.
