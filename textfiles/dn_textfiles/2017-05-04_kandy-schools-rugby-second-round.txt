Kandy schools rugby second round

What a weekend it was in the top Cup competition when unbeaten Trinity suffered their first defeat of the season when they were tamed by St. Peter’s at Bambalapitiya. In the other matches involving Kandy schools, Dharmaraja beat their arch rivals Kingswood in a Plate game, St. Anthony’s beat Vidyartha, St.Sylvester’s beat Piliyandala Central and Wariyapola Sri Sumangala (St.Paul’s) beat St.Thomas’ Matale in a Shield game.
TRINITY
Trinity which is a very exciting side and has some knowledgeable players, were very successful in winning all their first round matches and were the only school from Kandy to qualify for the Cup competition. But in their last outing they suffered a shocking defeat at the hands of St.Peter’s. They have a wealth of talent in their forwards and the back division too comprises some exciting players, but with all this they failed to do well due to a very poor display.
The side that played better rugby won. Trinity failed due to their own mistakes, the leadership had no control and lacked support, the three quarters combination of Boyagoda and Lashan failed to click and within 15 minutes of play Lashan was removed and replaced with another.
The Trinitians were over confident and did everything negative and this was capitalised by the Peterites. The rugby that was put on show by the Trinitians was not at all that enterprising. So, the four-year old Dennis Perera trophy was once again housed at Bambalapitiya which makes it three in a row for the Peterites. The rugby what the Peterites played in the second half was not a patch of the rugby that was shown in the first half. These two schools first met in 1933 and from 1943 to 1947 there was no fixture. This trophy was introduced in 2014.
DHARMARAJAH
Dharmarajah has a well balanced side and were able to beat their arch rivals Kingswood in the first second round match. The rugby that was played by the two schools in the first half was interesting. But in the second half the Kingswoodians were not that enterprising, they forgot the game. The Rajans halves combination made use of the good ball their forwards gave them and ran their three-quarters to earn tries.
Much was expected from Kingswood, but they failed to pocket the game. Kingswood, who were relegated last year were hoping to hit the top this season. For the Kingswoodians the result of this game was of utmost importance and they are expected to make every effort to win and gain promotion. Both teams played good rugby that was appreciated by the crowd. However after the final whistle some of the losing side’s supporters’ behavior was uncalled for.
ST. ANTHONY’S
St. Anthony’s with the schoolboy talent in their ranks beat Vidyartha in the second round Plate game. They did well in the first half and gave a dissapointing performance in the second half to their die hard supporters. They have the potential to perform well, but some “hoodoo” seems to be prevailing over them. It is time they settled down to some solid rugby to recapture the past. Antonian’s performance was good especially in the second half. Their next game is with Kingwood, and everyone hopes they will come out with some attacking rugby.
ST. SYLVESTER’S
St. Sylvester’s has very limited facilities but did well to beat Piliyandala Central in their first second round Bowl trophy match at Rajagiriya.
SRI SUMANAGALA
(ST. PAUL’S COLLEGE)
In the first second round game of the Shield competition Sri Sumangala (St. Paul’s) beat St. Thomas’ Matale in their second round game.
