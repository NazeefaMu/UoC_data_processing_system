Getting ready for the ballot box

If Sri Lankans watched the drama that preceded the local government elections with much amusement with major political parties jousting with each other to gain political advantage for the poll, they will be in for more of the same as the nation prepares for its first countrywide test of public opinion since this government came in to office almost three years ago.
The Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) is still coming to terms with its internal divisions, the United National Party (UNP) is saddled with the burdens of incumbency and mistakes for which it has only itself to blame and the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) is keen to create a significant impact on its first appearance as a major political force.
There was light relief for die-hard supporters of the SLFP when President Maithripala Sirisena and former President Mahinda Rajapaksa appeared together in public for the first time more than in two years. The occasion was the wedding of Pasanda Yapa Abeywardena, the son of State Minister Lakshman Yapa Abeywardena.
The two political rivals were not only the two attesting witnesses at the nuptials, they were seated at the same table making polite and convivial conversation, with Sports Minister Dayasiri Jaysasekara also in attendance. With photographers snapping away at this rare opportunity, Rajapaksa was to remark that there would now be stories of the SLPP and the SLFP uniting. However, any exchange the President and his predecessor had was limited to pleasantries and nothing political was discussed.
Local government elections
Politics was discussed however when President Sirisena telephoned another Rajapaksa sibling, SLPP stalwart and former Minister of Economic Affairs Basil Rajapaksa, following mediation from the Buddhist monk, Venerable Medagoda Abhayatissa Thera. When news of this appeared in the media, Rajapaksa himself offered an elaboration.
Rajapaksa was to say that this was his first contact with the President in several years but re-iterated that there should be an opposition to the government, hinting that any discussion he had about the two factions of the SLFP coming together would not bear fruit, at least in time for the local government elections. However, with the process of handing over nominations still underway, some SLFP old timers are hopeful that the two groups could still come to some understanding.
If there was any such agreement, none of that was evident on the ground with both the SLFP and the SLPP making hurried preparations for the poll, interviewing candidates. A further indication of this came when Minister Mahinda Amaraweera, a loyalist of President Sirisena, announced that the SLFP would be presenting candidates under not only its traditional ‘hand’ symbol but also the ‘betel leaf’ symbol. The ‘hand’ symbol has not been on the ballot paper since 1991, Amaraweera said.
The ‘betel leaf’ is the symbol of the United Peoples’ Freedom Alliance (UPFA) of which Amaraweera is now the General Secretary. It will be recalled that the SLFP contested under the banner of the UPFA at the August 2015 general elections. That the mainstream SLFP is fielding candidates under the UPFA symbol in some areas is yet another indication that it intends to hold its own against any attempts by the SLPP to usurp the UPFA symbol.
A blow to JO faction
A further blow to the Joint Opposition (JO) faction came in the form of defections from the ranks of the JO to the SLFP. The first to break ranks was Digamadulla district parliamentarian Sriyani Wijewickrema. Ms Wijewickrema, who is from the Mahajana Eksath Peramuna (MEP), met President Sirisena and pledged her support to the government, hours after voting against it in Parliament.
Following suit was Weerakumara Dissanayake. Dissanayake’s defection is politically more significant in many ways. An Anuradhapura district parliamentarian, Dissanayake has been in Parliament since 2004 and was from the Jathika Nidahas Peramuna (JNP), the faction led by Wimal Weerawansa that broke away from the Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP).
Dissanayake joined the government along with Piyasiri Wijenayake, the National Organiser of the JNP, with whom Weerawansa has been having differences of opinion, even publicly, for some time. The defections of both Dissanayake and Wijenayake to the SLFP is a bonus for President Sirisena and lays Weerawansa open to the criticism that his JNP is now reduced to a ‘one man show’.
Stalwarts from the JO have criticised these recent crossovers stating that Wijewickrema and Dissanayake crossed over to obtain deputy ministerial positions in the government. That may or may not eventuate but if anything, the defections highlight that it would not be plain sailing for the JO and that it does not enjoy a stranglehold on its parliamentarians. With several weeks more to go for the polls, more drama is likely.
While the SLFP and the SLPP are fighting it out to gain an advantage over each other, the UNP is also not without its share of difficulties. Having supported President Maithripala Sirisena in his presidential election campaign against Mahinda Rajapaksa and having become the party with the largest number of seats at the general election that followed, the UNP now has to fight problems of its own making.
At the top of that list is the beating its public image has taken following revelations made at the Presidential Commission of Inquiry into the sale of Central Bank bonds. Former Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayake has already become a casualty but now the UNP is finding that whenever it levels allegations of corruption against the Rajapaksa regime, its stalwarts are responding with counter allegations related to Central Bank bonds. Needless to say, the party’s reputation and integrity is not what it should be, just before an election.
This week, John Amaratunga, a senior UNPer and holding the portfolios of Tourism Development, Christian Religious Affairs and Land, generated more controversy by his remarks at a public meeting in Ja-Ela. “The government and the Police are ours this time. No one should be afraid. We will deal with anyone. What we want is your vote only,” Amaratunga told a UNP rally.
Rajapaksa regime
The opposition claims that the implied sentiment of these remarks is that the UNP will use the state resources and power to its advantage at the election- which is the kind of practice it accused the Rajapaksa regime of, when it was suffering for many years in the opposition and also the type of behaviour it pledged to stamp out when it came into office.
Already, the JO has complained about Amaratunga’s remarks and said that the Elections Commission should inquire into it. Amaratunga, now 77, completes forty years in Parliament next year and his remarks are unbecoming of a veteran politician and are unlikely to be helpful to the UNP.
Also, if the UNP believes that it can become victorious at the upcoming elections simply because the SLFP is divided into two camps, it needs to re-think its campaign strategy. The country has not seen a three cornered tussle between major parties since the 1993 provincial polls when the Democratic United National Front (DUNF) emerged as a breakaway faction of the UNP.
There might be a lull in campaigning during the Christmas and New Year season but tensions between the political parties and their leading personalities are likely to increase in the weeks to come. That is because the outcome will most certainly define the political direction of the nation for the next few years.
