Ditch traditional  fairy tales!

In these ultra PC days, telling someone how big their teeth are might have you done for body shaming…even if they’re a wolf dressed up in grandma clothing.
Sounds far-fetched?
Well, parents are apparently turning their backs on traditional fairy tales like Little Red Riding Hood these days for fear that they’re not politically correct.
Fables like The Gingerbread Man and The Three Little Pigs were deemed the worst offenders, with some mums and dads comparing them to horror films.
The poll, which was commissioned by musicMagpie, included 2,000 parents and revealed one in four parents improvised parts of storybooks as not to be politically incorrect.
Many felt that if you take a deeper look at some of the classics, they have some worrying messages that are not conducive to a progressive society.
In Cinderella, for example, parents felt it was inappropriate that she had to do all the cleaning in the home. Pinocchio encouraged lying, while The Ugly Duckling showed in order to be accepted, you have to be beautiful, some said.
Sleeping Beauty was also thought to be problematic as the prince kisses her when she’s asleep, bordering on necrophilia and issues of consent, with Beauty and the Beast posing bestiality issues.
A total of 16 percent found such fairy tales so violent or carrying the wrong message that they banned it from the home altogether.
Other reasons cited included violence.
In Little Red Riding Hood, for example, the child is eaten alive by a wolf, only to be saved by a hunter who cuts her out of the animal’s stomach with an axe.
The Three Little Pigs also depicts a violent ending with the three pigs killing the wolf and eating it. Similarly, in The Gingerbread Man, the protagonist is eaten by a fox.
“Some of these stories have been around for generations – many would have been read to mums and dads when they were children,” explained Liam Howley, marketing director at musicMagpie.
“But times have changed and there are many elements to these classic tales which for some don’t really fit into society as they once did. Not only that but when you think about the storylines, some can be considered very scary for little children.”
