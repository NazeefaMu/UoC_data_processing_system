Hard work  and planning

Every boy and girl is born with multiple talents but not every man and women can achieve success in life. The only factor which lies between talent and success is hard work and planning.
Michelangelo, one of the greatest artist who ever lived once said-‘If people knew how hard I worked to achieve my mastery, it wouldn’t seem so wonderful after all’. His words resonates how hard work played a part in defining the successes in his life. When Angelo Mathews hits a six or when Roger Federer wins a title, we will never see the years of hard work, efforts and sacrifices these people took to achieve that successful moment.
Life is always full of challenges. Failures are part of it. As a student, the difficult mathematics formula’s we have to crack, the length of historical dates we have to memorize, are all challenges and it’s normal that we struggle to master them. However persistence efforts and hard work along with little planning often pays off. Having said that it is also one of the most difficult things to master. Hard work is a quality which becomes part of your habit and is something we have to develop overtime. One of the secret formulas to this is planning. Students should always plan their next day and set targets on various activities they have to cover the next day including study time and home work. A detailed diary writing on your plans also will help. We should make conscious effort actively so that we always stick to the plan and execute them well. Practicing this over a period of time will make it a habit and part of your life and you will find the magic of success within your fingertips.
