From the day he could remember Wasantha Perera had a passion for the entertainment industry. His character was such that he always thought big and this may be the reason for him to take wing to Japan not only to pursue his studies but also to get employed. After being in Japan for three years he came back to unleash his dream.
Filled with ides and hungry for opportunities Wasantha stuck a right note when he decided to convert their family home (Mahagedara) in Nuwara Eliya to a star class hotel.

The quality of service that was offered at the hotel with the personal touch from Wasantha saw Sunhill gaining popularity and it soon became the talk of the town. With Sunhill maintaining high occupancy levels he decided to introduce excursion packages and bought a fleet of vehicles including jeeps.
Through his counter parts in Japan. Wasantha moved in to car sale and leasing business, becoming the first entrepreneur in the hill country to do so. He then diversified in to the real estate and even today he maintains his venture offering lands in prime locations for a competitive price.
