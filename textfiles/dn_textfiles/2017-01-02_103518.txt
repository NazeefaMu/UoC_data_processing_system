Traders at Panadura public market refuse to comply with UC orders

About 400 traders at the Panadura public market refused to obey orders of the Panadura Urban Council (UC) Secretary to leave their stalls at the market as the UC has not made alternative arrangements for them to continue their businesses. The Secretary had issued the order on December 16 after settling the due arrears to the UC.
The secretary had stated in the order that the Building Department engineers had condemned the building. The former Panadura Urban Councillor and the Panadura Public Market Traders' Association President told that 400 traders were at the market at present.
