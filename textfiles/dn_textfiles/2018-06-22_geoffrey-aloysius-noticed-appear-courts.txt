Geoffrey Aloysius noticed to appear in courts

Perpetual Treasuries Limited (PTL) Chairman Geoffrey Aloysius was yesterday noticed to appear before the Colombo Fort Magistrate on July 5 to inquire as to why he did not comply with a Court Order.
On a previous occasion, Fort Magistrate Lanka Jayaratne had issued an order directing Geoffrey Aloysius that a report pertaining to the direct and indirect assets belonging to PTL be provided for ongoing investigations.
The Court was informed through Senior Deputy Solicitor General Haripriya Jayasundara that PTL Chairman has failed to comply with this order and sought a suitable order in this regard.
Meanwhile, the court was informed that the Inland Revenue Department is yet to finalise the reports pertaining to the assets and liability statements regarding PTL.
Mrs. Jayasundara said a statement given by a witness by the name of Amal Ravindranath has confirmed the fact that a State Minister had received Rs.3 million from W.M.Mendis and Company. She further said the prosecution was conducting a complex investigation where the PTL had exchanged over 10,000 cheques among various third parties.
Meanwhile, Perpetual Treasuries Limited (PTL) beneficiary owner Arjun Aloysius and its Chief Executive Officer Kasun Palisena, arrested in connection with the controversial Central Bank Bond issue, were yesterday ordered to be further remanded till July 5 by the Colombo Fort Magistrate’s Court.
Defence Counsel Anil de Silva PC, Kalinga Indatissa PC appearing for the suspects informed court that they are expecting to file a fresh bail application on the next hearing date. Defence Counsel further said their clients were ready provide details pertaining to their assets and liabilities. The Magistrate ordered the suspects provide their assets and liability reports without any delay.
The Attorney General’s Department had informed Court that CID is in the process of initiating necessary legal action for the extradition of former Central Bank Governor Arjuna Mahendran.
The Colombo Fort Magistrate had issued a warrant written in English for the arrest of former Central Bank Governor Arjuna Mahendran, in connection with the controversial Central Bank Bond issue.
The court had issued a warrant against Arjuna Mahendran, the first suspect in the case, since he failed to comply with the court orders.
On February 16, Magistrate Lanka Jayaratne refused to release the two suspects on bail citing that reasons given by the defence were not sufficient enough to consider releasing the suspects on bail under exceptional circumstances.
The suspects have been charged under the Public Property Act, Penal Code, Registered Stocks and Securities Ordinance and Code of Conduct for Primary Dealers for illegal insider trading.
Filing a B report before the Colombo Fort Magistrate’s Court regarding the Central Bank Bond issuance on February 27, 2015, the CID had named former Central Bank Governor Arjuna Mahendran, Perpetual Treasuries Limited (PTL) beneficiary owner Arjun Aloysius, its Chief Executive Officer Kasun Palisena and the PTL as suspects in the case.
The prosecution maintained that there had been a direct loss to the government following the issuance of bonds on February 27, 2015.
The prosecution said that Arjuna Mahendran can be charged with criminal breach of trust, misappropriation of public funds and two others for aiding and abetting to commit this offence.
Senior Deputy Solicitor General Haripriya Jayasundara with Senior State Counsel Lakmini Girihagama appeared for the Attorney General. President’s Counsel Kalinga Indatissa with Anil Silva PC, and Jeewantha Jayatilleke appeared for the suspects.
