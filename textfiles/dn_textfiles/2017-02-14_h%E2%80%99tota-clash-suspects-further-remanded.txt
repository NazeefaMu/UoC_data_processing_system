H’tota clash suspects further remanded

Twenty-four suspects accused of violating court orders and damaging public property during a protest in Hambantota recently, were further remanded till February 27 by the Hambantota Magistrate’s Court yesterday.
One suspect was released with three sureties of Rs. 500,000 each to attend his sister’s wedding. Police arrested the suspects over the clash in Hambantota on January 7 when crowds gathered to protest the opening of the Sri Lanka – China Logistics and Industrial Zone (SLCLIZ).
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe and Chinese Ambassador Yi Xianliang opened the SLCLIZ on January 7 and security was stepped up in the area.
A court order too had been issued prior to the event barring demonstrations or protests in selected areas. Despite these measures, protestors converged in Hambantota and clashed with the police, hurling rocks and injuring over 20.
