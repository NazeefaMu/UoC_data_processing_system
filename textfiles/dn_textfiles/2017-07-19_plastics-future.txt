Plastics of future

Why do we need oxo-biodegradable plastic?
Because thousands of tons of plastic waste are entering the world’s environment every day, and will remain there for hundreds of years, unless collected for incineration.
How does it work?
A very small amount of pro-degradant additive is put into the manufacturing process. This breaks the molecular chains in the polymer, and at the end of its useful life the product falls apart. The plastic does not just fragment, but will be consumed by bacteria and fungi after the additive has reduced the molecular weight to a level which permits micro-organisms access to the carbon and hydrogen.
Does it really biodegrade, or does it just fragment?
When the material has reached the fragmentation stage it is no longer a plastic, and is “biodegradable” in the same way as nature’s wastes such as straw and twigs. The process continues until the material has biodegraded to nothing more than CO2, water, and humus, and it does not leave fragments of petro-polymers in the soil.
What does it cost?
Very little, because the additive represents less than 3% of the product, and because the products can be made with the same machines and workforce as ordinary plastic.
Won’t it put existing factories out of business, with loss of jobs?
No, because customers can still use the factories which supply them with ordinary plastic products.
What types of biodegradable plastics exist?
The two main types are oxo-biodegradable and hydro-biodegradable. In both cases degradation begins with a chemical process (oxidation or hydrolysis), followed by a biological process. Both types emit CO2 as they degrade, but hydro-biodegradables (usually starch-based) can also emit methane. Both types are compostable, but only oxo-biodegradable can be economically recycled.
Surely education is the way to solve the litter problem?
Hopefully education will reduce the litter problem over several generations, but there is a lot of litter today and there will always be some litter. Action needs to be taken today to switch to oxo-biodegradable before millions more tons of plastic waste accumulate in the environment.
Isn’t it better to recycle than to let it biodegrade?
Yes, and one of the benefits of oxo-biodegradable plastic is that it can be recycled as part of a normal plastic waste stream However, if the plastic is not collected it cannot be recycled, so it needs to biodegrade instead of accumulating in the environment.
What about energy recovery?
In some countries incineration is popular, and modern equipment is in place. Oxo-biodegradable plastic can be incinerated with energy recovery in the same way as conventional plastic, and has a higher calorific value than the hydro-biodegradable alternative.
Can it be composted?
Oxo-biodegradable plastic does not degrade quickly in low temperature “windrow” composting, but it is suitable for “in-vessel” composting at the higher temperatures required by the new EU animal by-products regulations. Indeed it is likely that windrow composting will soon have to be phased out.
What happens to it in a landfill?
Oxo-biodegradable plastics fragment and partially biodegrade to CO2 and water in the parts of the landfill where oxygen is present, but the residues are completely inert deeper in the landfill in the absence of oxygen. They do not emit any significant amounts of methane.
By contrast, hydro-biodegradable (starch-based) plastics will degrade and emit CO2 in a landfill if there is enough microbial activity. However, in the depths of a landfill, in the absence of air, hydro-biodegradable plastics generate copious quantities of methane, which is a powerful greenhouse gas.
Does it contain “heavy metals”?
No. It contains transition metal ions of Cobalt or Iron or Manganese, which are trace elements required in the human diet. They should not be confused with toxic heavy metals such as Lead, Mercury, Cadmium and Chromium, which are never used in oxo-biodegradable plastics.
Isn’t it made from oil?
Yes. Oxo-biodegradable plastics are currently made from a by-product of oil or natural gas. These are of course finite resources, but the by-product arises because the world needs fuels, and would arise whether or not the by-product were used to make plastic goods.
Until other fuels and lubricants have been developed for engines, it makes good environmental sense to use the by-product, instead of wasting it by “flare-off” at the refinery and using scarce agricultural resources to make plastics. In fact plastics could reduce the amount of oil and gas imported because after their useful life they can be incinerated to release the stored energy, which can be used to generate electricity or to heat buildings.
Recently, interest has been shown in manufacturing sugar-derived polyethylenes. These, like oil-derived PE, are not biodegradable, but they can be made oxo-biodegradable in the same way as the latter, by the addition of a pro-degradant additive.
Does it leave any harmful residues?
No. Oxo-biodegradable plastic passes all the usual ecotoxicity tests, including seed germination, plant growth and organism survival (daphnia, earthworms) tests carried out in accordance with international standards.
