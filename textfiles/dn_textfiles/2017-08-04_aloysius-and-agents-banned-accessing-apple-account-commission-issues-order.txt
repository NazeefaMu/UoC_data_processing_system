Aloysius and Agents Banned From Accessing Apple Account : Commission Issues Order

The Bond Commission yesterday issuing an order barred Arjun Aloysius or his agents from either accessing or tampering with information contained in his Apple electronic devices.
The Commission said that any violation of the order would amount to an offense under the Penal Code.
Earlier the Attorney Generals department sought an order barring Aloysius from accessing the accounts after it was revealed that there was an attempt to log into the account using Aloysius’ wife's phone.
Aloysius had previously informed the Commission that he had forgotten the password of his Apple account.
However, the Criminal Investigations Department had conducted a digital forensic audit and accessed the account, from which 8,600 pages of information was derived. The Commission said that it was making the order under the inherent powers vested in the Commission.
