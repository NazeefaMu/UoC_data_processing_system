Formation of SLFP Govt. difficult without MS-MR consensus: Sumedha

Sustainable Development and Wildlife Deputy Minister Sumedha G.Jayasena yesterday stressed that unless President Maithreepala Sirisena and former President Mahinda Rajapaksa leagued together, forming an SLFP government would be difficult for the Sri Lanka Freedom Party in the forthcoming General Election.
Deputy Minister Jayasena was speaking at a rally held in the Monaragala electorate to set up SLFP youth and women Balamandala units.
“The time has come to fortify the party’s (SLFP’s) preparations without delay,” she said.
“Many discussions take place taking into account the importance of the party’s interests. There have been disagreements and criticism,” she said.
“For all that, it is my firm belief that both President Maithripala Sirisena and former President Mahinda Rajapaksa will come together to secure victory of the Sri Lanka Freedom Party in the end,” she added.
