Elephant House and Keells Food refresh 138th ‘Battle of the Blues’

Elephant House and Keells Foods have, in 2017, continued their longstanding partnerships with the “Battle of the Blues”, the historic cricketing rivalry between Royal College and S. Thomas’ College, in its 138th year. This year’s “Royal-Thomian” cricket match reached its exciting conclusion on March 11 at the iconic Sinhalese Sports Club (SSC) grounds.
Every year, as the official “Food, Ice Cream and Beverage” sponsor of the “Royal-Thomian”, Elephant House and Keells Foods took it upon themselves to roll-out an extensive and diverse range of treats and eats at Sri Lanka’s most exclusive ‘big match’.
