JO rally begins from Shalika grounds as planned

 
 The Joint Opposition May Day rally will start from Shalika grounds as planned, leader of the Joint Opposition and Mahajana Eksath Peramuna Dinesh Gunawardena said.
While vehemently condemning the cancellation of the permit issued to use Shalika Grounds as the commencement point of the Joint Opposition May Day rally, the MP said: “This is the work of an invisible hand to scuttle the efforts of the Joint Opposition.”
Addressing a media briefing at N.M.Perera Auditorium yesterday, he said the rally faced such a hindrance because it is the only anti-UNP May Day Rally that is being organised.
“The democratic mask of the Yahapalana government was detached with this anti-democratic action taken by them. We are saddened that the Joint Opposition had been denied the right to use Shalika Grounds at the last minute although prior reservations had been made,” Gunawardena said.
He noted that Field Marshal Sarath Fonseka’s party was allowed to use Shalika Grounds last year for their May Day Rally although the government claims that it is the first time that a party had requested to use the ground for a May Day Rally.
However, the May Day procession of the Joint Opposition would commence at Shalika Grounds as previously planned and end with a rally in Kirulopane Grounds despite the cancellation of the reservation of Shalika Grounds in Narahenpita, Gunawardena said.
He also condemned the cancellation of the May Day rally of the Samurdi Association which itself proves the cowardliness of the government by trying to suppress the voice of the public worker.
While stressing the fact that the Kirulapona May Day rally would be one of the most successful rallies held in history so far, Gunawardene said the public burdened by the excessive taxation by the government, along with a number of professionals who are against the ETCA agreement would mass at the Joint Opposition May Day Rally signifying the highest participation. When questioned whether President Maithripala Sirisena had been invited for the rally, Gunawardena said that since it is an anti-UNP rally they are not expecting to put anyone in trouble.
