Toddy and beedi – cottage industries no more?

Sri Lanka is home to several cottage industries that villagers all over the island have engaged in for time immemorial.
Although some of these may be deemed controversial in nature, like the toddy trade and beedi, their scale and purpose warranted little or no action against them. For instance, both these domestic industries enjoy the lowest tax bracket in Sri Lanka’s excise regime and a blind eye is often turned on these meagre income owners.
A toddy tapper simply needs to pay Rs. 250 per tree for a year and is permitted to sell the produce at his or her own premises.

The Tobacco Tax Act states that no product is to be removed from any factory it is made at until the payable tax has been paid. However, for beedi, there is no real manufacturing or consumption data and production is estimated purely by the quantity of tendu leaf which is imported into the country. As per official estimates, the numbers have hardly changed over 25 years.
Accordingly, little or no attention has been paid to these segments as they have historically been tagged cottage industries that serve microeconomies, with production numbers that hardly nudge the needle. During an ongoing islandwide economic and social survey, details are emerging that suggest the need to possibly reconsider our stance.
During our visit to the Northern and Eastern provinces including the Jaffna, Kodikamam, Vadamaarachchi and Kilinochchi districts, we were impressed to note that shops and outlets in rural areas were devoid of tobacco or alcohol products as government and non-governmental agencies prohibit their sale with the objective of preventing social degradation.
But these cottage industries persist and serve local consumers with ample volumes laying waste to the objectives of fighting intoxication. In one village of 400 families, we estimated daily consumption of toddy and beedi at 220 litres and 700 sticks – all of it off the grid.
In addition to the harmful social and health implications of both, the revenue loss to government when extrapolated islandwide is more than significant, with guesstimates at over Rs. 100 million a day.
We have confidence in stating this is an islandwide problem, as we encountered families rolling beedi all over Sri Lanka including the Galle, Matara, Negombo, Colombo, Kandy, Anuradhapura, Nuwara Eliya and Badulla districts.
In some instances, these domestic producers served small batches of consumers in their vicinity, but with others we found them producing and packaging beedis for mass distribution and sale sometimes through intermediaries – intermediaries that they did not know were in fact large-scale businessmen.
Priced as low as Rs. 5 a stick at times, consumers can buy beedi in large volumes, encouraging increased consumption. One ailing consumer from Nawalapitiya said he smokes a stack of 20 in two days, as beedi was easily available and far cheaper than a cigarette.
When questioned on his ill health and the impacts of smoking, he added that he was aware of its outcomes but that beedi 'is safer because as it is a natural product'.
It is difficult to place a finger on the exact extent of beedi production and consumption in Sri Lanka, but given the feedback we received from consumers and producers all over the island the number has surely grown.
The North, North Central, Central and Southern provinces yielded some answers as to why this increase is not reflected in tendu leaf imports, as manufacturers were using local leaf alternatives which some of them identified as 'paan'.
There are two facets of concern here. On one side is the serious revenue loss to government, as consumption grows unregulated also spawning illegal businesses. Whilst it is difficult to state a conclusive figure, it is safe to estimate that the government loses over Rs. 8 billion annually from the beedi trade due to the industry being undertaxed.
On the other hand, there are the multiple health issues: that consumers think and traders promote beedi as a ‘safer natural product’ presents one extremity of the problem, whilst health costs to treat consumers impacted by consumption would no doubt heap further burden on the administration.
Of toddy and beedi, I am of the opinion that beedi is a far more serious concern. I say so because toddy is a far more visible trade and one that is difficult to conduct indiscernibly as a cottage trade or otherwise.
Trees need to be tapped, there is a fermentation process involved and it is difficult to miss a trail of intoxicated individuals if the authorities were to crack down on any illicit or licensed liquor dens.
In addition, almost all domestic producers were paying excise fees to government, though admittedly and by our own estimation over 50 percent of total produce remains undisclosed.
The potential loss to government from the cottage toddy trade was an estimated Rs. 900 million, with a cup of fresh unaltered toddy going for low as Rs. 75 in some places.
In most parts of the country, local authorities seemed aware of local toddy tappers and consumers, but there was a great lack of awareness with respect to beedi, which often happened behind closed doors.
In Negombo and Anuradhapura, it was evident that this was part of a large well-organised racket and that we were in fact just skimming the tip of a very large iceberg, with respondents choosing to answer very carefully.
In a milieu of growth and development and a want for revenue, I believe it is imperative that we revisit our approach towards some of our very traditional industries – to promote them, to safeguard them, and where necessary… to further regulate them in order to ensure law and order and due returns and revenue to government. The beedi and toddy trade are top of mind for the latter. Revenue aside, if left unregulated they will spawn - and likely have already spawned – a number of undesirable elements which can spiral out of control at national level. Accordingly, it could become prudent and timely for the government to empower and set up ground level enforcement via the police, excise and security forces to ensure controls.
