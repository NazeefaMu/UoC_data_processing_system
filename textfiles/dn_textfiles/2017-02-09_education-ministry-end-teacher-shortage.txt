Education Ministry to end teacher shortage

The Education Ministry will recruit teachers to end the teacher shortage in schools, Education Minister Akila Viraj Kariyawasam said.
About 3,868 Physical Training Instructors will be recruited to end the shortage of PTIs in schools.
Meanwhile, 1,732 assistant teachers who are serving in rural schools will be recruited to the teachers’ service as Grade 3-11 teachers. As a remedy to end the Tamil medium teacher shortage, 3,202 retired teachers will be recruited on contract basis. About 1,093 graduates will be recruited to teach science and mathematics streams in Advanced Levels in National Schools. They will be recruited as Graduate Teachers to Grade 3-1 (A) of the teachers’ service.
Meanwhile, applications will be called from diploma holders and advanced level passed applicants to fill the teacher shortage in primary and secondary schools. Once the Education Ministry receives the approval of the State Services Commission, application process will be carried out. These teachers will be recruited on provincial basis.
Minister Kariyawasan said attention has been drawn on amending the teachers’ service minute after discussing with teachers' unions. He said assistant teachers' allowance will be increased from Rs. 6,000 to Rs. 10,000 aiming to evaluate their service, while obtaining the best outcome.
When the Minister was questioned by the media as to why the ministry does not concentrate on streamlining the school sport sector, he said the ministry has taken measures to streamline the school sport sector.
“That is why we are going to recruit 3,868 PTIs to schools. Regional wise and zonal wise sport meets will be carried out again,” he said.
The minister said teachers who are serving more than 10 years in the same national school will be transferred. Speaking on the SAITM issue, he said he is not against the private universities, but those universities should maintain quality standards. It is better to establish private universities in the country since it keeps billions of money in the country as students need not go abroad for higher education.
He said two more medical faculties will be established in Wayamba and Sabaragamuwa universities.
