Police to take action against ‘police brutality’

Police condemns all forms of police brutality and we will take the sternest action to stop such acts recurring, said Police Spokesman, DIG Priyantha Jayakody yesterday, as he explained that it was necessary to make the stance of the police clear in such cases.
DIG Jayakody was referring to an incident where two traffic police officers in Dodangoda mercilessly beat a 16-year-old on April 1, over a traffic offence. The incident which was caught on video was published on many media outlets. The student, according to DIG Jayakody, was driving a motorcycle without a valid licence and when asked to stop, he had sped away and thereafter collided with an oncoming three wheeler. The police had then caught him and beaten him up. “As soon as the incident was known, we launched an investigation and produced the two officers in court. Given the public outcry over the incident, we asked that they be remanded, but the judge released them on Rs 200,000 surety bail each,” he said as he addressed a media briefing held at Police Headquarters.
The suspects however, were not tried under the Torture Act but on assault charges and the DIG said they would refer to the AG’s advice on how they would proceed further. “We do not want this incident to damage the image of the Police. We have 84,000 police officers working with us under various circumstances and there are bound to be a few undisciplined individuals in the group. But, the Police is more than capable of dealing with them,” said the Police Spokesperson.
