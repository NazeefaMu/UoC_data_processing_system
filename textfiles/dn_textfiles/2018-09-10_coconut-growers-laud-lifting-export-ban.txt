Coconut growers laud  lifting of export ban

The government has lifted the ban imposed on exporting fresh coconuts responding favourably, to the appeal made by the Coconut Growers Association Sri Lanka, (CGASL).
A former President of the CGASL Ranjith Dias, said with the lifting of the ban imposed on the export of fresh coconut, members and exporters were in a position to utilize the opportunity to their benefit.
Dias said that the Coconut Cultivation Board (CCB) has allowed the exporters to make use of the export license issued for the year 2017, until the end of this year. He said this was a result of the efforts on the part of the CGASL, who made representations to the authorities. The coconut industry in Sri Lanka was in crisis in the recent past, and the industry along with the CGASL had been concerned over the farm gate price coming down to the range of Rs. 23 to 25. This was around Rs 45 in July this year.
The CGASL had requested the authorities to intervene to revive the farm-gate price, as it was a necessity with the coconut growers could not even meet the cost of production per nut, which was around Rs 30 to 45, at the time the association made the request.
Dias said the association was happy with the government’s decision to impose Rs. 20 as duty on imported palm oil per each kg which in turn stabilize the farm-gate price of coconuts and help those involved in coconut growing industry.
