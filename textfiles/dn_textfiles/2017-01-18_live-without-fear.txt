Live without fear

Fear. Biya. Bhayam. I am afraid it is a frightful word. Its meaning is known to man, beast and even plants, say scientists. Fear has a string of adverbs and adjectives attached to it. Also words that are close to it which gives a narration more flavour. But fear is fear. Fear is also called phobia. It is one sensation that revolves round all the sensations that are a part of man and beast.
The frightful message is sent to the brain by the sense of touch, sight, hearing, smell and taste. Ones reflexes could respond at lightning speed because of fear. Starting with animals. Fear controls them. It makes rats to flee from cats. Fear keep birds away from scarecrows, in plantations. The hungry crow will give a wide berth to a black feather or cloth. The millipede will curl up when disturbed. Dogs bark. It is fear or aggressiveness. Bend down to pick up a stone. It runs away. Begins to bark at a sale distance away. It is mainly fear that cause our friends in the lower rungs of the evolutionary ladder to attack or show aggression. Should a very knowing human disturb a hornets’ nest or bee hive, the results are obvious. They are afraid. Fear travels with man from infancy to grave. Why does a new born babe cry? Is it joy or fear? It must surely be fear. Because the new one will sense that he is entering a world full of fear, from its cozy 360 odd day sojourn in the mother’s water bag. Then comes the grave. Many around the serene body are thoughtful. Fear. When will this happen to me? He died of a heart attack. I don’t want to die young. Fear haunts the mourner.
A human being encounters fear more than any other feeling like guilt, joy, laughter, hatred or sorrow. Always a feeling of what will happen next? If nature goes berserk, a demonstration on the road, fear engulfs you. Fear is a very active partner in all actions of man. Also, when fear is active, depression creeps in. Fear engulfs tears and joy during childbirth, at home, in office, in a hospital and fear accompanies us during our travels. Thoughts are marred by fear. ‘My hair stood on end’, got goose pimples, numb with fear ‘petrified with fear’ are common descriptions of fear. They say that Adrenaline is copiously secreted in times of fear. Animals can sense it. There are times when fear is warranted. There are times when we have to take precautions – against infectious diseases, natural calamities hydrophobia and the fear of heights – vertigo and the common fear of enclosed places like elevators. Fear makes a ‘drowning man to grails a straw”.
