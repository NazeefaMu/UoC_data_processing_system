TNA BLASTS NEW SYSTEM AFTER COUNCIL DEFEAT

The Tamil National Alliance (TNA) this week came out strongly against the new mixed electoral system as they failed to gain control of their first urban council after the last local government elections.
The Vavuniya Urban Council on Monday (16) went to the TULF. The TNA had the majority number of eight members being elected to the Council of 21. But the TULF managed to form a coalition of UNPers, SLFPers, SLPP and EPRLF to gain control of the council.
EPRLF’s R. Gowthaman was elected as Chairman with 11 votes. TNA Vanni district MP Dr S. Sivamohan yesterday criticised the new mixed electoral system for their defeat and blamed it for allowing a party with just three members elected to gain power in the council.
“This new system is very wrong. A person who gets 150 votes can get elected to the council whilst someone who gets 1,500 votes can be left out”, he said.
The MP also added that it had allowed for people to bribe their way into power and position.
When asked why the TNA did not resort to alliances rather than criticise the system, Dr Sivamohan pointed out that it was not the policy of the TNA to go for alliances.
In the North the party had worked with other Tamil political parties to gain power in the local government bodies, but Dr Sivamohan insisted that these parties supported the TNA without any favour promised,
“It was their choice to support us. We did not promise to appoint a vice chairman or share terms with them”.
At the conclusion of Monday’s election however, a fight broke out between UNP Vavuniya Organizer, P Karunadasa and Northern Provincial Councillor and brother of Minister Rishard Bathuideen, Rifkaan Bathuideen. The former alleged that Bathuideen had intervened in the election to bribe the four of the UNP members to vote on behalf of the TULF.
