Bracing for food scarcity: Drive to cultivate subsidiary crops in Anuradhapura

The Agriculture Department has embarked on a programme to cultivate 3,700 acres with subsidiary food crops under 10,000 cultivation wells in the Anuradhapura district as a crash programme.
Presidential Secretariat's Nonpoisonous Food Crops Project District Coordinator and Assistant District Agriculture Director Sirisena Herath told the Daily News that 10,000 farmer families are selected for the cultivation programme of maize, kurakkan, ground nuts, big onions, undhu, green gram, cowpee and and yams. He said the main objective of the programme is to avoid any possible food scarcity in the rural areas due to the drought.
The programme is implemented in 22 Divisional Secretariat divisions at the Grama Niladhari division level.
The Agriculture Department has made arrangements to secure 50,000 kilograms from the Palwehera government farm and distribute them among selected farmer families. The distribution programme will commence from March 15. Another programme is implemented to rehabilitate dilapidated cultivation wells. Herath said maize will be cultivated in 1,000 acres. About 7,000 kilograms of maize seeds will be distributed among farmers, he said.
A project is in progress to dig 700 new cultivation wells in rural areas. Selected farmers are granted Rs. 100,000 to construct a cultivation well, Herath said.
