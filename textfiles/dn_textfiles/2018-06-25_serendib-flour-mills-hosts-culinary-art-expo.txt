Serendib Flour Mills hosts the Culinary Art Expo

Serendib Flour Mills was the main sponsor of the Culinary Art Food Expo 2018 - Sri Lanka’s largest showcase of brands and businesses in the hospitality and food and beverage industries. The highly anticipated exhibition was held from June 1 to 3 at the BMICH and was attended by the country’s top chefs and representatives from leading hotels and restaurants from across the island. Partnering with the event for the first time, SFML also conducted the ‘7 Star Master Baker of the Year’ award and showcased an array of its 7 Star wheat flour products at two dedicated stalls.
Organized by the Chefs Guild of Lanka and the World Association of Chefs’ Societies, the Culinary Art Food Exhibition is the largest and most comprehensive food and beverage exhibition in Sri Lanka, with over 2000 culinary professionals gathering under one roof each year. Now in its 18th edition, the exhibition attracts over 30,000 visitors from all over the world, including hoteliers, chefs, homemakers and avid food lovers.
Attended by both local and foreign buyers from the food and beverage and hospitality industries, the event also serves as a prominent platform for exhibitors to showcase their products, expand their networks, as well as connect with existing and potential customers. Over 45 chefs from renowned hotels participated at the ‘7 Star Master Baker of the Year’ competition. The competition attracted representatives from hotels such as Cinnamon Lakeside, Heritance Kandalama, Club Hotel Dolphin, Hilton Colombo, Grand Hotel Nuwara Eliya and many more. After a close competition, where all the participants demonstrated a wide range of skills and their creative baking talents, the Shangri La Hambantota team headed by Chef Ruwan Madushanka was named the second runner up and the Blackpool Hotel team headed by Chef P Madushanka Jayawickrama emerged as the first runner up.
Securing the top spot, the Cinnamon Bey Beruwala team, which was headed by Chef Gayan Sadaruwan emerged as the champions and bagged the prestigious ‘7 Star Master Baker of the Year’ award.
The competition proved to be a novel and innovative initiative which encouraged the bakers and culinary professionals to showcase their expertise whilst enabling them to engage with and learn from their peers and colleagues in the industry.
