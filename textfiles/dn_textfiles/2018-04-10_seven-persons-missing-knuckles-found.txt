Seven persons missing in Knuckles found

The seven persons who were reported missing in the Knuckles range having gone on an expedition were found, police said. Three of them had returned to their homes. The other four were found by search teams last afternoon, the Police Media Spokesman’s Office told the Daily News.
The group was unable to find their way because they did not receive mobile signal in the area, police said.
Panvila Police had commenced an operation to search seven persons after receiving a 119 emergency call. They were reported missing having gone on an expedition on Sunday around 11.10 pm. They are residents of the Homagama area.
They had informed their homes that they were lost on April 8, Police Media Spokesman SP Ruwan Gunasekara said.
A police team from the Panwila Police was dispatched in search of the group. Several search teams were deployed for the task by the Rangala, Ududumbara, Laggala and Rattota police stations as well to locate the missing.
Military Spokesman Brigadier Sumith Atapattu said four army teams of around 50 personnel were also deployed to search the areas not covered by the police.
