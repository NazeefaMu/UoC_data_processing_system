Liver transplants  at NHSL, Ragama  after 4 pm considered

Health Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne is considering the possibility of facilitating liver transplant surgeries at the Colombo National Hospital and Ragama Teaching Hospital after 4 pm, a Health Ministry spokesman said.
According to the spokesman, Minister Senaratne had stated that if doctors are willing to perform liver transplant surgeries after 4 pm, he is ready to facilitate payments for their service.
The minister took this decision after considering the possibility of cutting down long waiting lists for liver transplant surgeries.
The minister informed his stand to Consultant Surgeons of the two hospitals.
He has already discussed with the Air Force Commander about obtaining facilities to airlift organs when required and a Cabinet paper is to be presented soon regarding this, he said.
