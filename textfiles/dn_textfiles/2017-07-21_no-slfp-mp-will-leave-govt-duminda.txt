No SLFP MP will leave govt.- Duminda

Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) General Secretary and Agriculture Minister Duminda Dissanayake yesterday said he was certain that no SLFP Parliamentarian will leave the Government.
Dissanayake was responding to a question from a journalist at a press briefing in Colombo, about speculation that 18 SLFP Parliamentarians are planning to leave the government shortly.
Dissanayake went on to say that there is no need to panic and take a decision on whether to leave the Government at this juncture as the bipartite agreement between the UNP and SLFP will go till December.
“However, it can be considered whether to leave by December when reaching the end of the bipartite agreement,” he added..
He noted that the political stability of any country is a key factor for attracting foreign investments.
“It is natural to have disputes within any political party. The SLFP is not an exception. It doesn’t mean that the Government is unstable,” he said.
Minister Dissanayake pointed out that the media should act in a responsible manner when reporting disputes as such reporting may convey a wrong picture that there is no political stability in the country. This wrong image may be a hindrance to attract foreign investment.
