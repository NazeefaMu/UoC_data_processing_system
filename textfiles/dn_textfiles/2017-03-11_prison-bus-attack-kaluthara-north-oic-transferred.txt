Prison bus attack: Kaluthara North OIC transferred

 

 

Kalutara North Police OIC Ananda De Silva was transferred to Colombo North Division on disciplinary grounds after the prison bus carrying underworld figures including Aruna Shantha alias “Samayan” came under attack in Kalutara on February 27. Seven people were killed when unidentified gunmen opened fire at the bus carrying these prisoners to the Kaduwela Magistrate’s Courts from Kalutara.
They also attacked a van with prison officials who were providing security, killing two.
The IGP has transferred the OIC on the recommendation of National Police Commission (NPC) yesterday. IGP Pujith Jayasundera who participated in an event in Killinochchi last week had said that there was a lapse from the part of Kalutara North Police OIC for not providing security to the prison  bus even after a request was made
IGP Pujith Jayasundara has admitted to a shortcoming by police to some extent in the Kalutara Jayasundara made the observation while speaking at an event held in Kilinochchi on Monday. Jayasundara also said that it would be not enough to point finger at both police and prison authorities over the incident.
