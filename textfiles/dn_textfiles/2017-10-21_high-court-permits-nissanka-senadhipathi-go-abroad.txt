High Court permits Nissanka Senadhipathi to go abroad

Avant-Garde Maritime Services (Pvt) Ltd Chairman Nissanka Senadhipathi whose passport was impounded by Court as a part of the Court inquiry for allegedly offering a bribe of Rs. 35.5 million regarding the Avant-Garde floating armory transaction, was yesterday permitted to travel abroad until March 1 by the Colombo High Court.
While permitting Nissanka Senadhipathi to travel abroad, Colombo High Court Judge R. Gurusinghe ordered to temporarily release his passport and directed him to be present in Court on the next trial dates.
The High Court made this order pursuant to a request made by the defence counsel that his client be permitted to go abroad for medical treatment and business activities.
The prosecution did not raise any objection for this request.
At a previous occasion, the Colombo High Court served indictments on Avant-Garde Maritime Services (Pvt) Ltd Chairman Nissanka Senadhipathi and Major General Palitha Fernando who headed the state-owned Rakna Lanka company for allegedly offering and accepting a bribe of Rs.35.5 million regarding the Avant-Garde floating armory transaction.
The case was fixed for trial on March 19, 20, 21 and 22.

The two accused were arrested by the Bribery Commission on September 6, 2016 for offering a bribe of Rs.35.5 million to Major General Palitha Fernando by Avant-Garde Chairman Nissanka Senadhipathi consequent to the Avant-Garde floating armory transaction between 2012 and 2014.
