Why we need professional voters

The green signal has been given to the Local Government Elections by the Election Commission Chairman Mahinda Deshapriya by announcing the date. All the political parties are busy with nominating the right candidates to contest in their respective parties. Once the selection is over, the politicians will begin their election propaganda by generously throwing broken promises in a way to convince the prospective voters. It is an acceptable custom in our country that the politicians do make seasonal visits to the homes of innocent voters and mesmerise them to vote.
That will fulfil their needs but not of the people. Once again the good samaritans will forget the people’s grievances. In practical terms, people go in search of politicians to remind and request them to fulfil their promises made during the election. Having unfulfilled the pledges and promises of the previous elections, the politicians once again give numerous unrealistic promises. Finally they will be the winners and the innocent voters, the losers.
This is a usual and recurrent event in Sri Lankan politics. The voters are also somewhat responsible for their own grievances. Once the politicians cheated them, they should wake up and should teach them a good lesson in the next election. On contrary, they re-elect the person who cheated them in the previous election.
When the politicians are in power, the ball is in their hands. But now, during the election, the ball is absolutely in the voter's custody. They must use the ball to bolt the person who kept the promises unfulfilled. The voters are the powerful crowd blessed with the power to use their valuable franchise to change the fate of the politicians as well as the democratic socialist republic.
Thus, every single voter in the country shall know the value of their votes and shall cast votes to elect the right representative who will do a yeoman service following the election. The voter's power is the supreme power in a democratic country and the real sovereignty rests in the people’s hands.
Real democracy
Refer to the US President Abraham Lincoln's definition for democracy: Democracy is a government of the people, by the people, and for the people. His definition clearly tells us that we must elect the right person among the mass so as to rule our people. This fact is of course forgotten by most of the voters in our country. They cast the votes for the sake of casting votes.
This attitude should be changed and we should realise the blunder we have had committed and the punishments given for our ignorance. Every citizen of this country should use their franchise to change the history of country. We must be the contributor and the partner to create genuine democracy in the country and thereby enjoy the benefits of real democracy.
A large portion of people do not use their valuable votes on various grounds. They loathe politics, politicians, or the prevailing political trend of the country. This could be due to corruptions and violence during the elections.
Whatever the reason, we must remember that voting is our inalienable right which we should exercise in order to protect and preserve democracy in the country. To insist on the same matter, Additional Elections Commissioner M M Mohammed has proposed to impose a penalty on the person who does not cast his vote.
A similar system is in operation in countries like Australia. Of course no need to impose a fine on them, if the voters really understand the value of their votes. Rather than imposing fines, we should educate them through conducting awareness programmes across the country. I had a privilege to attend such an awareness workshop conducted by Election Commissioner Mahinda Deshapriya educating the people on the value of their votes and why we should use our vote in election. He provided a clear picture about democracy, sovereignty of the people and the country. Once the mass understand the value and the power of their franchise, they will never misuse or abuse their voting rights.
Local Government elections
The general public should be vigilant about the candidates who are going to contest and represent our society after the election. The political leaders select candidates without any educational and moral background for their personal gains. But this is our responsibility to accept such a person or reject them in the upcoming Local Government elections.
This is our time and we must make use of our rare and golden opportunity. If we miss this valuable opportunity we will have to wait for another four years to change the situation. As the proverb advises, make hay while the sun shines for opportunity neglected seldom returns.
There is an unfamiliar and ugly culture prevailing in our country that politicians distribute money and utility goods among innocent, poor laymen targeting their valuable votes. This is not at all a healthy or acceptable culture for the country or people.
The general public earnestly request the politicians to try to form a decent political culture in the country where our future generation will ride their horses without showing them the bad examples and the improper or nasty culture. Therefore it is our duty to form a good political culture where everyone’s right is respected and protected and try to bring back the real democracy in the country so as to reap benefits ourselves first and the country at large.
