Case against Tawheed Jamath referred to AG

The case against six members of Sri Lanka Tawheed Jamath (SLTJ) for allegedly making derogatory remarks on the Buddha and hurting the sentiments of the Sinhala-Buddhist community, has been referred to the Attorney General for advice.
The Colombo Crimes Division (CCD) conducting investigations into the incident informed Colombo Chief Magistrate Lal Ranasinghe Bandara that the extracts of the investigations have been forwarded to the Attorney General.
Meanwhile, the Chief Magistrate directed the CCD to file a report in Court explaining whether the Secretary to Sri Lanka Thowheed Jamath Abdul Razik has violated the bail order after making a derogatory statement against buddhist monks. At a previous occasion, the Department of Buddhist Affairs in a report informed Court that alleged derogatory remarks made by the SLTJ through a video has caused damage to the country’s religious harmony.
In this case, six members of the SLTJ are being prosecuted for making derogatory remarks on the Buddha and hurting the sentiments of the Sinhala-Buddhist community. Ven. Soranathota Chandrarathana Thera had lodged a complaint with CCD alleging that a video footage released by the SLTJ has insulted the Buddha and Sinhala community. The complainant alleged that the SLTJ Secretary Abdul Razik had deliberately made derogatory remarks on the Buddha on April 13, 2013 citing that the Buddha had eaten human flesh and ‘triple gem’ means just stones.
Further Magisterial inquiry into the incident was fixed for July 19.
Counsel Darshana Ranmuthuge appeared for the complainant while Counsel Maithri Gunaratne with Shiraz Noordeen appeared for the suspects.
