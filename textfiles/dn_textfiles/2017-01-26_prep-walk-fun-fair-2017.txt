Prep Walk & Fun Fair 2017

The community at S. Thomas’ Preparatory School, Kollupitiya consisting of boys, teachers, parents, old boys and well wishers will meet on the January 28 (Saturday), in an effort to strengthen their bonds of camaraderie with a walk and fun together.
The basic idea of this exercise is to collect funds to renovate, “Fortrose”, the first building put up when the school was first started in 1938. It was also the home to all those who became hostellers in the School.
The walk is meant to be a “walk together” and show the oneness and what has grown to be.
The walk will commence from the Hotel Taj Samudra car park and proceed past the School along Galle Road to Kollupitiya junction and along Dharmapala Mawatha.It will then turn left at ‘Piththala Junction’and proceed along James Peiris Mawatha to the final stretch along Perahera Mawatha through Rotunda Gardens and back to the school. The evening will be full of fun and frolic where around 3,000 people are expected to participate.
Students,old boys, parents and those associated with the school in whatever manner will indeed walk hand in hand and together take a positive step in an effort to see the Prep School through to the future.
A large number of past students of Prep School from all walks of life will join the present students to make this event which is organised by the Parent-Teacher Association and the Old Boys Union an unforgettable one.
