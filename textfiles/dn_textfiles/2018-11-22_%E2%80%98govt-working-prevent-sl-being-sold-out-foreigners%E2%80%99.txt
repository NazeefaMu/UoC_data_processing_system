‘Govt working to prevent SL being sold out to foreigners’

“We are now struggling to save Sri Lanka and its citizens from being sold out to foreigners and to safeguard the democratic rights of the common people of this country, said State Finance Minister Anura Priyadarshana Yapa.
He was speaking at a public meeting in Pannala for voters of the Katugampola electorate of the Kurunegala district on Tuesday.
There has been a severe betrayal of our country by the UNP in the recent past. The UNP was selling national assets to foreign countries and hence, President Maithripala Sirisena was compelled, even reluctantly, to look for a patriotic PM for Sri Lanka, he said.
That is why President Sirisena ultimately chose former President Mahinda Rajapaksa as the new PM, because he was a patriotic leader of Sri Lanka who saved this country from the brutal LTTE a few years ago, ending 30 years of terrorism, the State Minister said.
Anti-democratic elements of this country have joined hands with Western anti-Sri Lankan elements to ruin this noble country. Patriotic Sri Lankans should not allow that type of conspiracy in the country, he said.
“Let’s work in unity to defeat the anti-Sri Lankan forces and anti-democratic elements that haunt Sri Lanka by holding a General Election soon to test the will of the common people of this country,” the State Minister said. “We should do everything possible to solve the existing political issues in a friendly, democratic and peaceful manner, and that is what both President Sirisena and new Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa aspire to at this critical hour.”
“All political leaders and Parliamentarians have a duty to the country and its people to ensure the democratic rights of the citizens of this country.”
“All religious dignitaries belonging to all faiths in this country have requested political leaders to work and act in peace at this moment, for the welfare of this country,” he said.
