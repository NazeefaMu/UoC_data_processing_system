No shortage of  Dextran 40 drug: DG

There is no shortage of the drug Dextran 40 prescribed to dengue patients at present. Adequate stocks of the drug have been distributed among government hospitals,Acting Health Services Director General Dr. Sarath Amunugama said.
He refuted GMOA claims that there is a shortage of the drug.
“The GMOA in a media statement had alleged that there is currently a shortage of Dextran 40. This is completely false and incorrect,”the Acting Health Services Director General said, adding that there is no sign of dengue fever spreading in flood affected areas at present.
“However, since the disease could appear in such areas after the floods recede, a decision to keep adequate stocks of the Dextran 40 drug was taken at a special disaster management meeting held at the Health Ministry recently.
At this meeting, a decision was taken to urgently import 5,000 vials of Dextran from Thailand through the World Health Organisation. “Steps had also been taken to import further stocks of Dextran through the State Pharmaceuticals Cooperation,” he said.
