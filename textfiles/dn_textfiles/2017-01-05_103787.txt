Timely solutions

Architecture addresses life. It engages with the mind. Most importantly, it deals with human beings and their inconsistencies which are a part of life. Humans mature differently and their personalities are diverse which ultimately affect the rest of their lives and the environment around them. An architect needs to understand this wide and inconsistent spectrum and provide answers and solutions to lifestyles. Arch World met up with Architect Palinda Kannangara to find out how creative you need to be to provide answers to this grey area in life.
“I like to have open houses with no hidden corners or isolated areas. When you have more open spaces, there is more interaction and visual connections. I also try to play with light and shadows and try and get some ventilation into the house,” said Kannangara.
Knowing a client’s occupation, number of kids, their background and social systems is necessary for Kannangara.
“Some clients say, ‘I don’t want to have a TV, I just want to read’. You need to create spaces that are more into reading and writing with little disturbance. I have to understand their lifestyles, their budgets and the context. When I consider all these aspects, I get a tailor-made, unique solution,” stated Kannangara.
Kannangara relishes in challenges. This is because they ultimately result in answers.
“I am not afraid of challenges. It is an answer to my next project. If you do not have challenges, it is difficult to design. If you just have an open canvas without any input from clients or from the site, you may not know what to do. So you need challenges to design. Challenges help you to be more creative and think out of the box. The more challenges the better as they give better solutions to designs,” pointed out Kannangara.
Kannangara feels that if you are true to your designs, you can go a long way.
“My designs are consistent with the people’s understanding of the world. In that respect, Sri Lankans are unique architecturally and admired by many people. In Sri Lanka, clients are advanced and knowledgeable. They can understand architects and architecture. This is a plus point for Sri Lankan architects,” explained Kannangara.
Kannangara feels that his architecture strives to give identity, simplicity and a connection to nature.
“Architects have to advise clients if they are going beyond the budget. Addressing deep human needs such as rest and relaxation, belonging, identity and security are part and parcel of the architectural service. I am always trying to give that to the client, in a way that matches their requirements but also giving value added things. When you understand their background, you can give them a personalized solution or answer,” elucidated Kannangara.
The project stems from the client’s requirements. Clients have different ways of looking at things.
“They may want to have a rooftop because they want to entertain people. But the way a rooftop is used is different from person to person. Sometimes they may ask for things that are not within their culture. They may have seen a rooftop somewhere and they want it. The lifestyle must match requirements. Then you can deliver a unique design,” added Kannangara.
The client should be open to the architect. You cannot hide things about your lifestyle. It is a bit psychological because you have to be frank and honest with each other. The only way you can come up with answers is by talking about it.
“The consumerist culture is good in a way. The Sri Lankan consumer is family-oriented. They consider their parents. So we want to have a room at ground level. You need to consider culture, values and religion,” informed Kannangara.
According to Kannangara, Sri Lankan architects have always been minimal.
“We never had clutter. We never collect a lot of stuff. Contemporary architecture is the same,” said Kannangara.
True architecture is timeless. It is not copied. Your answer to the client and context makes it true. Fake is doing something without knowing why you are doing it. If you are answering the context and client requirements, that makes it true and you have to be involved in that project. Then it becomes a timeless project,” expressed Kannangara.
An architect needs to be open to new ideas because there has to be a next generation. You need to do new things creatively. Otherwise, you tend to repeat the past.
“In other countries, Sri Lankan architects are greatly respected. We try to do something different always. But you still need to keep in mind where you live and to whom you are designing. You can’t copy. That won’t work here,” clarified Kannangara.
It is not Kannangara’s policy to negotiate or challenge tradition.
“You need to understand how important your tradition is. I love my tradition and I love my past. But we still have to live in our present. I always believe that architecture should represent the times. But you have to respect the past. Some of them are masterpieces. We need to understand how it has evolved from then to now. We can’t forget our roots. You have to cater to your needs, climate and context. That is how age old architecture has become masterpieces and timeless projects. If you consider all of this, then you are doing something unique and relevant to Sri Lanka,” explained Kannangara.
If you try to follow styles and trends all the time, you won’t be at peace. “They come and go. Being open to new things is good, but you should not do this blindly. You can’t be a follower without knowing what you are doing. New technologies or elements in the market are fine but we must not be a slave to it. If you know what you are doing, no one can take you for a ride. You must control your architecture,” summed up Kannangara.
