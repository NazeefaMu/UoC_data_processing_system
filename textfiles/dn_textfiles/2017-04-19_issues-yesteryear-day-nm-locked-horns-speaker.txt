Issues of yesteryear : Day that N.M. locked horns with the Speaker

Fifty eight years ago, on Feb 13, 1959, House of Representatives of the sixth Parliament assembled at the house to debate on the amended Public Security Bill presented by the Prime Minister S.W.R.D. Bandaranaike, who lead the MEP.
Several days before, at a news conference, LSSP Leader Dr. N.M. Perera and the Leader of the opposition in the House has told that there was a big hubbub and large scale objection in the country against the above bill. Almost all trade unions and a number of social organizations had rallied against this cruel piece of legislation. But the then government was in great hurry, and it wanted to finish off the debate and get the bill passed on the very same day it was taken up for debating.
The amended bill was hotly debated at the House. The intensity of the debating took turns from proponents to opponents. It was around 7:00 pm, and the Maturata UNP MP M.D. Banda was on his feet. Prime Minister Bandaranaike intervened and wanted the debating to be wound up immediately. Speaker at the Chair H.S. Ismail, the MP for Puttalam, concurred with the PM.
The LSSP MP for Kotte Robert Gunawardena and his Party Leader Dr N.M. Perera took to their feet almost simultaneously. Gunawardena confined himself back to his seat, leaving his leader to take charge. N.M. quoted from the rules and regulations applicable to parliamentary proceedings, provided examples from debates in the past, and explained that PM’s intervention and his intentions contravened established norms. N.M. was vociferous, and other MPs in the house who opposed the bill followed N.M. and pandemonium reigned supreme in the house. He roared and thundered that the government cannot impose its will on the house. The Speaker had no alternative; he was compelled to suspend sitting.

On resumption, around 7:15 pm, Colvin R. de Silva, the LSSP, MP for Wellawatte/Galkissa, rose to his feet and raised a point of order. He argued that the Speaker had breached standing orders by re-convening the house, as he has failed to indicate the duration for which the sitting had been suspended at the onset. But speaker ruled against Dr. de Silva’s objection and the proceedings were continued.
Around 7:30 pm, police officers entered the parliamentary public gallery and forced the occupants to vacate the chamber. Some objected and arguments erupted. But by force or persuasion, all occupants were made to vacate, and the gallery looked like a cemetery. The Police entered the press gallery and tried to evict the reporters, but the reporters stood their ground and refused to leave. If not for the fearless stand of those reporters, what’s being published through this article would not have seen the light of the day.
As the clock struck 8:00 pm, a peon entered the house and started removing the red-ink bottles attached to the tables of the members in the opposition. Who ordered the removal of ink pots? Was it the PM who was well aware of the unruly behaviour of the leftists in the opposition, who were once his buddies. Nothing extraordinary or eventful took place, even though some red ink bottles were left behind the tables. Robert, the renown revolutionary, the ‘Kotte Sinhaya,’ heaved a sigh of relief as nothing harmful took place.
By 8:15 pm, N.M. was on his feet and wanted to speak. The speaker cut him short and cried ‘Order Please’. N.M. was unmoved; he continued his errand. PM intervened and proposed that N.M. should be evicted from the house. A proposal was adopted, and the Speaker Ismail ordered the sergeant in arms to evict N.M.. The sergeant approached N.M. and he asked him politely to leave the chamber; N.M. remained unmoved. Speaker was compelled again to suspend sitting. On this occasion, he ensured that duration of the suspension was announced properly. It was for 15 minutes.
Soon after, police officers exhibiting the precision and speed of the Nazi armies when they invaded the French borders during the Second World War, entered the House of Parliament with helmets on heads and battons in their hands. N.M. was their target, and he had to be carried out of the chamber. Dehiowita MP Dr. Colvin, Edmund Samarakkody, Kotte MP Robert Gunawardena, and Moratuwa MP Merril Fernando, hastened to the defense of N.M., surrounding him as protective wall. ‘We won’t allow you to remove our leader,’ they protested with clenched fists. But in spite of their fervent pleas and violent outbursts, the Police prevailed; N.M. was moved forcibly out of Parliament.
Following this incident, LSSP MPs took to disobeying the orders of the Speaker as a habbit, and a number of dramatic episodes in the caliber of ‘Vinoda Samya’ crept into the parliamentary chambers. Revolutionary slogans like ‘Unnath dhahai, merunath dhahai’ and ‘Api katadha baya’ were aired out by the LSSP members. A jovial atmosphere prevailed in the House, and the Government MPs kept their mouth shut and were in a very apprehensive mood in face of the heroic-like behaviour of the LSSP members.
LSSP members continued with their protest campaign and paid no respect to the orders of the Speaker. In the process, Samarakkody met the same fate as that of his leader—he was forcibly evicted from the house by 8:30 pm. Forcible evictions followed one after another, and almost all LSSP MPs were forcibly evicted. Agalawatta MP Anil Munasinghe met his fate by 8:40 pm; 8:45 pm signalled the expulsion of Badulla MP J.C.T. Kotalawela. Bandarawala MP Y.G. Jayasinghe’s turn came next, and he was ousted by 9:00 pm, Moratuwa MP Merril Fernando, Negombo MP Dr. Hector Fernando, and Balangoda MP Jothipala, were evicted out of the house in quick succession at 9:10 pm and 0:20 am. Last to be moved out were Dr. Colvin and Panadura MP Leslie Gunawardena.
By 9:35 pm, the procession of forced evictions and bodily removals were completed, and the government benchers had the whole House for them and them alone.
Gunawardena, who remained un-evicted, resorted to some new antics. He jumped on to his chair and began to deliver a speech in loud voice. But he was silenced immediately and was made to march out of the chamber, of course under force and duress. All those tantrums and comical antics of the LSSPers made the Speaker’s tasks impossible, and he had to suspend sittings again and again.
LSSP MPs for Colombo South and Colombo North, Bernard Soysa and Vivien Gunawardena, respectively, left the House in protest along with the Leader of the Federal Party who was the MP for KKS, S.J.V. Chelvanayagam. UNPers and also Mawanella MP C.R. Beligammana and Dandagamuwa MP I.M.R.A. Iriyagolla joined the protests. By the time woman constables entered the house to evict Gunawardena, she had already left the house.
Gampaha MP S.D. Bandaranaike, Potuwil MP M M Mustapa, and Kalkuda MP A.H. Marcan Maker, remained in the House and participated in the deliberations, but they voted against the Bill when it was taken for voting. The Bill was passed with majority of 47 votes.
Dr. N.M. Perera, who was a veteran politician, counting over 42 years of service as a Member of the State Council and Member of Parliament, had never disobeyed the orders of Speaker, However, he made history on Feb 13, 1959, as the first and only time a MP disobeyed the Speaker.
