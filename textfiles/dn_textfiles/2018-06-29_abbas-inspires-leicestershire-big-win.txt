Abbas inspires Leicestershire to big win

LONDON, Wednesday – Six second-innings wickets from Mohammad Abbas helped Leicestershire ease to a six-wicket victory over Derbyshire go third in the Division Two of the County Championship.
Having taken two wickets late on day two to leave Derbyshire on 43-3 at stumps, the Pakistan bowler ripped through Derbyshire’s top order. Matt Critchley’s 86 was the only score of note in a total of 186 all out.
Abbas took 6-54 before Leicestershire made their target of 133 in 29.4 overs.
Middlesex were bowled out cheaply for a second time in the match as they were thrashed by 342 runs by new Division Two leaders Kent at Canterbury.
The visitors were all out for 56 on day one, with most of the damage done with the pink ball under floodlights.
Chasing 467 to win, Middlesex lost their last eight wickets in the first session of the third day - six of them to catches behind the wicket. Harry Podmore took a career-best 6-36 as Middlesex subsided to 124 all out.
Essex and Somerset seem set for a draw despite the hosts losing two late wickets at Chelmsford in Division One.
Resuming on 140-2, all of Somerset’s top-eight batsmen passed 20, but only James Hildreth (78) and opener Eddie Byrom (54) made half-centuries. Essex’s bowlers steadily made their way through Somerset’s order - Neil Wagner taking 3-122 as they were dismissed for 407 with nine overs left in the day. The hosts closed on 17-2 to lead by 127 going into the final day.
Alex Davies and Dane Vilas both scored centuries for Lancashire as they moved towards a high-scoring draw on a batsmen-friendly wicket against fellow Division One strugglers Hampshire.
Davies scored 115 and Vilas hit a fine 134 as the hosts reached 411 to trail by 40 runs after the first innings.
Hampshire ended day three on 66-2 to take a lead of 106 runs.
Warwickshire appear best placed to force victory on an intriguing final day of their match against Durham.
The visitors ended day three on 152-5 in their second innings to lead by 279.
Durham were in danger of following on in reply to Warwickshire’s 424, but Gareth Harte and Nathan Rimmington added 54 for the eighth wicket to help the hosts to 297 all out, 127 behind.
Warwicks looked in good shape with Jonathan Trott going well, but he fell for 53, keeping the hosts in touch.
The ex-England batsman, who scored 170 not out in Warwickshire’s first innings, passed the milestone of 500 County Championship runs this season. Division One leaders Surrey need 139 more runs to beat Yorkshire with all 10 second-innings wickets remaining after a Morne Morkel-inspired comeback.
Surrey trailed by 75 after the first innings despite Ollie Pope’s unbeaten 69 helping them take their overnight total from 219-7 to 267 all out. Morkel scored 29 and then took 5-39 as Yorkshire collapsed to 152 all out.
Chasing 228 to win, unbeaten duo Rory Burns (55) and Mark Stoneman (32) guided Surrey to 89-0 at the close.
Worcestershire survived a tricky 19 overs to reach 43-0 in their second innings as they chased a tough victory target of 462 against Nottinghamshire. Worcestershire took their overnight total of 215-7 to 287, meaning the hosts had a first-innings lead of 212.
Notts decided against enforcing the follow-on and piled on the runs through Jake Libby (100 not out), Samit Patel (71) and Riki Wessels (55 not out).But unbeaten openers Daryl Mitchell (19) and Martin Guptill (18) held firm.
Glamorgan go into day four staring at defeat on a precarious 121-4, after being set a mammoth 434 to win or four sessions to survive by Northants. Ricardo Vasconcelos (79) and Steven Crook (73) combined in a sixth-wicket stand of 147 in their 406-9 declared. Earlier, Ben Duckett (133) and Luke Procter (70) set a new record opening stand of 208 for Northants against Glamorgan. Ruaidhri Smith, with a career-best 4-75, helped to check their momentum.
The visitors struck a key blow late in the final session when Vasconcelos took a superb reflex catch at short-leg to dismiss Glamorgan’s in-form Australia Test batsman Usman Khawaja for 38, caught off Sri Lankan spinner Seekkuge Prasanna.
