Parliamentary Act on Dr. Neville Fernando Hospital

An Act to be presented to Parliament soon in connection with the Dr. Neville Fernando Hospital, Health Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne had stated. It is similar to the Act that brought in to establish Sri Jayewardenepura General Hospital, he had stated.
Minister Senaratne had stated that the act would be presented once the descriptive agreement on the hospital signed. “The Attorney General is now formulating the agreement. It will be signed thereafter,” he said.
Minister Senaratne had stated that a tri-party Letter of Intent was signed among the Health Ministry, Management of South Asian Institute of Technology and Medicine (SAITM) and the Bank of Ceylon. The hospital was taken over by the Government on August 1 on a Cabinet decision.
Once the descriptive agreement was formulated by the Legal Draftsman’s Department, it would be gazetted, the Minister had stated.
