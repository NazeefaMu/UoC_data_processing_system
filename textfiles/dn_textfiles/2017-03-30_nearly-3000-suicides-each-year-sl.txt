Nearly 3,000 suicides each year in SL

Each year nearly 3,000 persons commit suicide in Sri Lanka and 40 percent of them are men and 24 percent of them are women. They are above the age of 15. Two percent among them are those who suffer from serious mental diseases, Director of the Mental Health Directorate Dr.Chinthamali De Silva said.
Addressing a press conference at the Media Ministry Auditorium in Colombo yesterday she said that there are 800,000 persons in Sri Lanka who suffer from depression. Alcohol abuse is one of the main reasons for developing mental diseases.
WHO Mental Health Officer Suveen Thirapathy said that one out of every eight Sri Lankans suffer from some sort of mental illness but only 40 percent of them receive medical treatment. More women are victims of mental diseases than men and the most affected age group is 50 to 69.
Consultant Psychiatrist Dr. Neil Fernando said that talking itself is a relief for a person who suffer from depression. Depression is based on sadness and pregnant mothers, mothers who just delivered babies, persons suffering from various chronic disease, the elderly, students etc. are at risk of developing depression.
