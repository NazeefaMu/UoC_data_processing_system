JCB launches in Sri Lanka with partner United Motors

JCB, the World’s Leading Manufacturer of Construction Equipment, and United Motors Lanka PLC (UML), the 70-year old distributor of world-renowned passenger and commercial vehicle brands, announced a strategic partnership on Thursday (14) to further consolidate JCB’s extensive range of machines for Sri Lanka.
The announcement was made at the press conference held at its newly built state of the art 3S facility located at Peliyagoda, which will cater to customers of JCB machines for all their equipment related requirements including Sales, Service and JCB Genuine Parts.
The product portfolio will cover excavators, compactors, wheeled loaders, telescopic handlers and power generators for Sri Lanka and the Maldivian markets.
“We are delighted to announce our partnership with United Motors Lanka PLC. JCB is committed to providing world-class products and services for its customers. Through this partnership, we look forward to contributing towards the building of Infrastructure in Sri Lanka” said Vipin Sondhi, Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer, JCB India.
Chanaka Yatawara, UML Group Chief Executive Officer / Executive Director stated that the main focus will be to ensure that customers will have minimum down time of their machines by adopting JCB’s latest telematics technology, JCB Livelink, which enables us to monitor the performance of each machine. This technology will help in carrying out preventive maintenance and improve productivity.
This exclusive centre will offer services such as sales of the JCB product range, mechanical repairs, painting, welding, servicing and maintenance. The company’s mobile service units are well equipped with sophisticated tools and skilled staff who will respond immediately to urgent breakdowns throughout the country.
UML will also use “JCB Livelink”, a ground breaking technology that is used at the new service facility, which will remotely monitor the performance of all machinery. This will identify and alert the JCB users of any urgent issues or a decrease in efficiency of the machine early and will provide the necessary details for servicing and product support.
