KANDY SPORTS ROUND UP : 26th Vidyartha-Sylvester’s l/o today

Interesting cricket is in store when traditional rivals St. Sylvester's College takes on Vidyartha College in the 27th limited overs cricket encounter at the Asgiriya Stadium. At the same venue on Sunday they will play their 5th T20 match. Their inaugural limited-over game was played in 1989, where the two schools had to share the trophy in a rain washed out game.
This game is played for a trophy in memory of S. Mediwake, the person who introduced cricket to Vidyartha. In the series two games were not played and a few games ended in no- decisions. Sylvestrians have won it the most. St. Sylvester's led by Manjula Perera should have the edge over Vidyartha College led by Ravishka Upananda.

Football, hockey clubs to meet Sports Minister
Some of the football and hockey lovers are to meet the Sports Minister and request him to give a helping hand to uplift the sport in Kandy. Football and hockey first saw the light of day in Kandy in the nineteenth century. Football was first played in Kandy among clubs in the 1930’s. Today organized football is neglected at club level, the 2015 and 2016 inter-club tournaments are still to be completed.
Hockey in Kandy dates far back to 1907, when the Indian Rajput Regiment occupied the Kandy Military Barracks, the present Police grounds where St. Anthony’s College students use to play with the Indians.
The first "bully-off" in Kandy was in 1907 at the Bogambara grounds when Kandy Sports Club and Industrial Schools team met. Hockey 'died' in 1909 and it was revived in the 1930s when P.T. Rajan stepped in to introduce the game to the schools and later clubs took it seriously. Today how the game is run in Kandy is unacceptable. They don’t organize club tournaments but only get active a few months before the AGM.
5th week of schools rugby
Trinity won their fourth match of the season when they beat S.Thomas’ and brought back the Canon de Saram shield to Kandy. They remain unbeaten in the competition. Their next game is with Prince of Wales at Pallekele, which is going to be the last league game. Dharmaraja went down badly to St. Joseph's and will be playing Vidyartha the date of which has still not been fixed. St Anthony’s who had no game last week will play St. Joseph's in Kandy on Sunday. Vidyartha thrashed St. Sylvester's with a half century score to win the Banda/Nilagoda trophy. Sri Sumangala who went down to Nalanda in their last game will play Royal Panadura this week.
Mahanuwara and Colombo at snooker
With the cue sport in the dustbin in Kandy at club level, it was good to see Mahanuwara and Colombo YMBA playing six snooker and three billiard matches. It was a good evening of cue sport and a large crowd was there to enjoy it.
All matches went in favour of the Colombo YMBA. Today only the YMBA is active in cue sport, clubs like Garden Club, Kandy Club have tables but no tournaments whatsoever.
Today in some clubs the cue room has become the store room to stuff empty liquor bottles and bill books. Who is to blame? They become active only when it is time to renew liquor licenses.
Kandy’s rugby lovers say well done to the ladies
