‘Attempts to bribe journalists bared’

A journalist who is now a coordinating secretary to a deputy minister had tried to deposit money in journalists’ accounts to make them publish pro-SAITM news and features in Sunday newspapers, Government Medical Officers Association (GMOA) Secretary Dr. Navin De Zoysa said.
Addressing a press conference held at the GMOA Head Quarters in Colombo yesterday, he said the GMOA will not stop its struggle until the government take over the SAITM. The responsibility of the strike directly goes to the Health Minister and the Higher Education Minister.
GMOA Editor Dr. Nalinda Herath said the people are losing confidence in the country’s law and judiciary because two ministers violate law by breaching the Medical Ordinance and the University Act in broad daylight.
No decision will be made according to the requirements of politicians, he said. GMOA Media Spokesman Dr. Samantha Ananda said poor patients in Sri Lanka cannot seek medical treatment from the Mount Elizabeth Hospital, Singapore.
Therefore, the safety of patients should be ensured within Sri Lanka.
