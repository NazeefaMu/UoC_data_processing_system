Kuda Wewel Dalaya detected with gunshot injury

The baby elephant known as Kuda Wewel Dalaya frequenting the main road bordering the Digampathaha reserve in Dambulla has sustained a gunshot injury in one of its legs. Officers attached to the Sigiriya Wildlife Office noticed it during an inspection tour conducted on April 20 following a tip off.
After close observation the wildlife officers noticed that the wound had festered. As the elephant attempted to pounce on the officers, they had to drive it away into the jungle by firing an Ali Wedi.
Wildlife officer W.M. Bandaranaike said the baby elephant and six other elephants who come to the reserve to feed on the garbage collected from Dambulla and dumped there have received gun shot wounds mostly caused by trap guns.
