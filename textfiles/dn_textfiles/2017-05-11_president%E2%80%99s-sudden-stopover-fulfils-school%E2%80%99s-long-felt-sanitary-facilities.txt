President’s sudden stopover fulfils school’s long-felt sanitary facilities

The sudden stopover of the President Maithripala Sirisena at Talawakele en route to Nuwara Eliya resulted in the construction of a new set of wash-rooms for students at the Kotagala Tamil Maha Vidyalaya by the Army and donation of an ambulance to a rural hospital in the Kotagala area.
The President took time off to mingle with members of the public during his tour to Nuwara Eliya who rushed to the location in Talawakele on hearing the news of the President’s arrival there. Among them was the principal at the Kotagala Tamil Maha Vidyalaya. The President, who had a friendly word with the principal and others at that point, inquired into shortcomings in the school and the area.
The principal promptly requested the President to get some new wash-rooms done for his school students as wash-rooms available in the school are not at all adequate for so many students.
On being informed of the President’s pledge, the Commander of the Army, Lieutenant General Crisanthe De Silva instructed the Security Force Headquarters - Central (SFHQ-C) to undertake the construction of six more new wash-rooms as early as possible to fulfil the President’s assurances given to the principal.
On May 6, the Army-built six new wash-rooms at the Kotagala Tamil Maha Vidyalaya were vested in students during a brief ceremony attended by Brigadier Administration and Quartering (BAQ) of the SFHQ-C on behalf of Major General Upul Vithanage, Commander, Security Forces - Central.
Army troops under the SFHQ-C comprised of Corps of Engineer Services (CES) and 19 Sri Lanka National Guard (SLNG) completed the construction project at a cost of Rs 5 lakhs. The troops laid a new water supply pipeline directly to the new wash-room complex by bringing it to match with necessary hygienic standards.
The principal, teachers, students, several army officers and civilians participated in the brief ceremony.
