Egg prices drop, poultry farmers in trouble

Prasad Poornamal,
Puttalama District Group Corr.
Wholesale price of an egg drops down further to Rs. 10.
Farmers point out the wholesale price of an egg must be at least Rs. 12.
Many people in the Wayamba Province including Hettipola, Bingiriya, Bowatta and Weerapokuna engage in poultry farming.
A farmer said he sold eggs at Rs. 9 each.
However, other essential items for poultry farming have increased, the farmers lamented.
