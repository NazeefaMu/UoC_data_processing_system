New dairy products to nourish the nation

Pelwatte Dairy Industries will launch a range of new dairy based products. Utilizing factories and facilities in Buttala and Moneragala the company will make new products such as Drinking Yoghurt, UHT Milk, Flavoured UHT Milk, Infant Milk Powder and a collection of novel ice-cream flavours.
“We have an ambitious plan for this year. We aim to release a number of new product ranges, some with flavours that have not been seen in the Sri Lankan market before. Extensive market research has been conducted over what is lacking in the dairy market in Sri Lanka, and will fill those gaps with quality assured products,” said Pelwatte Dairy’s Managing Director, Akmal Wickramanayake.
Using only 100 per cent locally sourced milk, Pelwatte Dairy will launch a range of completely new drinking yoghurts for the Sri Lankan market. The product will provide consumers with a completely natural and organic product range.
Meanwhile the launch of unflavoured and flavoured UHT Milk is also on the cards. The re-launch will see fresh liquid milk sourced from farmers around the country reaching consumers in ready-to-use packaging. The existing flavoured milk line will also be revamped to provide consumers with a range of classic and new flavours of liquid milk. These will be a much-needed nutrition addition to children’s diets.
Also catering to the growing need of locally produced infant milk, Pelwatte Dairy will also take on the challenge of providing a quality assured and reasonable alternative to a market that is made up of predominantly foreign products.
The Pelwatte Ice-Cream range will be expanded with an exciting range of flavours. Once again no artificial colours and flavours will be used in these products to ensure highest quality. In addition to the new range of products Pelwatte Dairy also have plans to increase their production capacity for full cream milk powder by 50 per cent.
