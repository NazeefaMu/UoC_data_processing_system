Golden Key Hospital  celebrates 10 years of Eye, ENT care

The Golden Key Hospital celebrates its 10th anniversary in August 2017, marking a decade in which it performed more than 40,000 cataract and other eye surgeries and over 5000 ENT surgeries.
Sri Lanka’s super specialty hospital for Eye and ENT care said it will offer a 10 per cent discount on all Eye and ENT investigations throughout August to commemorate this milestone anniversary.
The hospital will also present cash rewards to staff members who have completed ten years with the institution or have more than five years of uninterrupted service, as a token of appreciation for their contribution to its growth.
The only private hospital exclusively dedicated to Eye and ENT care in Sri Lanka, the 44-bed Golden Key Hospital claims to have the most number of visiting doctors in its areas of specialisation - 25 eye consultants and 14 ENT consultants.
A spokesperson for the hospital said it had acquired new eye sub-specialties such as cornea as well as plastic and reconstructive surgeries over the past few years to be able to provide a better service to its patients. The recent addition of surgical microscopy, Angioplex OCT angiography,corneal transplant and combined cataract surgery and corneal transplantation reflect the hospital’s commitment to offering the complete range of services with state-of-the-art equipment, the spokesperson said.
The hospital’s operating theatres are constructed according to the latest high tech modular concepts that in turn result in zero contamination and zero complications.
The Golden Key Hospital is the only private sector hospital in Sri Lanka that is a centre of excellence dedicated and equipped for all Eye and ENT related investigations, treatment and surgery. The hospital is backed by a team of experts and nursing staff with specialised training in Eye and ENT.
The hospital features a 24 hour general OPD, a laboratory, pharmacy and ample parking for up to 80 vehicles at a time. It is managed by an Advisory Committee comprising of Vidya Jyothi Professor Rohan W. Jayasekera, Emeritus Professor and former Dean of the Faculty of Medicine, University of Colombo (Chairman), Dr Saliya Pathirana, Senior Consultant Eye Surgeon, Dr Saumya Paranawithana, Consultant Eye Surgeon, Dr Dilruwani Aryasingha, Consultant Eye Surgeon and Niranjan Silva (Chief Operating Officer).
