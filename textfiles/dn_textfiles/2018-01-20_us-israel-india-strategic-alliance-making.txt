US-Israel-India strategic alliance in the making

Israel Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu visited India from January 14-18. Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi went to the airport to personally greet him. Netanyahu’s visit reciprocated the visit of Modi to Israel last year.
The reception Netanyahu received in New Delhi is also exceptionally warm as the one Modi received in Tel Aviv. This shows the importance attached by both countries to their mutual relations. The Bharatiya Janata Party has been agitating for full diplomatic relations between India and Israel since 1991. The Congress Government subsequently established full diplomatic relations in 1992. It is a consequence of India embracing neo-liberal ideology under which it sought investments from Israeli corporate interests.
It is no secret that the United States was pressurizing India to do so. The fact that it was during the visit of Prime Minister Narasimha Rao to the United States that he announced India’s decision to establish full diplomatic relations with Israel, cannot be a mere coincidence.
Israel has strong economic relations with India, especially in the fields of agriculture and defense. Nearly 300 Israeli corporations are active in India at present. Israel is the third largest seller of arms to India after Russia and the United States. India has the largest fleet of Israeli drones, even larger than that of Israel itself. Netanyahu was pressing for a speedy finalization of an FTA with India besides promoting further arms deals.
However, the significance of the visit is more political than economic. Politically, the purpose and result of the visit is to consolidate a new strategic Axis comprising the United States, Israel and India in the Asia Pacific region, particularly in its maritime space. Needless to say that such an axis would be a threat to peace (perhaps an “Axis of Evil”!) in the littoral states in the Indian and Pacific oceans as well as to security of navigation in international waters.
Washington has never denied its intention of forming a strategic alliance to counter China which it considers its rival and challenger. It has been supporting India and pushing it to become the regional super power to counter China. While Israel has been a traditional US ally, India has not yet been fully accommodated in the United States partnership. There is no doubt that the warming up of Indo-Israel ties has Uncle Sam’s blessings. With all its military and economic strength Israel cannot advance without the assistance and protection of the United States. The latter has always defended Israel saved it in many a crisis. The United States has vetoed almost all (perhaps barring one) UN Security Council resolutions that either criticized Israel or tried to impose sanctions on it.
Earth faces existential threat
“A three-year streak of record hot years (2015-17), each above 1° Celsius, combined with record-breaking economic losses from disasters in 2017 should tell us all that we are facing an existential threat to the planet which requires a drastic response,” according to the United Nations Secretary-General’s Special Representative for Disaster Risk Reduction, Robert Glasser.
Petteri Taalas, Secretary-General of the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) said that “Seventeen of the 18 warmest years on record have all been during this century, and the degree of warming during the past three years has been exceptional”.
Warming has consequences that are even more harmful high temperatures. They include adverse weather conditions such as cyclones, floods, melting of Arctic and Antarctic ice causing rise in sea-levels and ocean acidifications.
Experts cast doubt whether the Paris Climate Accord goal of reducing global temperature by 1.50 C could be achieved at all. The decision of the United States to withdraw from the Accord is also seen as a negative development contributing to such failure.
US strangle Palestine refugees
United States Department of State announced on Tuesday that it was withholding $65m out of a $125m aid package earmarked for the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestinian Refugees (UNRWA). Earlier on January 3rd President Trump had threatened to cut aid to Palestinians.
For nearly 70 years, UNRWA has been the lifeline to the more than five million registered Palestinian refugees in the occupied territories and Lebanon, Jordan and Syria. It offers support in food supply, access to education, healthcare, social services and employment.
UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres expressed his deep "concern" about the move.
Meanwhile, Belgium has pledged to donate 19 m euro ($23m) to UNRWA for Palestinian refugees, after the US government announced it would slash its funding to the agency by half.
UNRWA was established in 1949 in order to provide assistance to Palestinian refugees, who in the aftermath of the 1948 Arab-Israeli War numbered about 700,000.
The agency now offers support to approximately five million Palestinians in education, healthcare and housing.
