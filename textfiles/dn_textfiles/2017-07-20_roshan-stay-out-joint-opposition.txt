Roshan to stay out of Joint Opposition

UPFA MP Roshan Ranasinghe has decided to keep away from Joint Opposition political activities for some time.
MP Ranasinghe said he will not be taking part in any of the gatherings, media briefings and all other programs organised by the Joint Opposition Party.
Asked as to what the immediate cause for the decision was, Ranasinghe said certain grievances related to decision making of certain Joint Opposition leaders have been the main cause.
