Boy drowns in Kelani Ganga

A 13-year-old schoolboy was drowned when he ventured into the Kelani Ganga banks with his father on a fishing expedition from a location in Nugewela around 4 pm on March 20.
He was identified as Vijayakumara Kalairama, a Grade 7 student of the Maskeliya Lakambe Tamil Vidyalaya, Police said.
Investigations revealed that Vijayakumar and his father had engaged in fishing from two locations on the river bank when Vijayakumar had slipped and fallen into a deep water hole in the river. As he raised cries, the father who rushed to his aid too had fallen into difficulties.
Thereafter, neighbours who rushed to the scene, had saved the father by getting him to climb up to the bank by hanging on to the branch of a tree they had held out to him. However, Vijayakumar had drowned and disappeared into the deep waters.
Maskeliya Police had summoned the Navy to help locate and retrieve his body. Maskeliya Police are investigating.
