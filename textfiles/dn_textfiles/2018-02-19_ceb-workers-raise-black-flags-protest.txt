CEB workers raise black flags in protest

 
Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) workers this morning raised black flags in front of the CEB head office in protest against the CEB management.
Convener of the CEB Joint Trade Union Ranjan Jayalal said they would launch an island wide protest if a viable solution to their grievances was not provided.
