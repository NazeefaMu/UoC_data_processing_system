Canadian delegation here to strengthen ties

A delegation from the Canadian branch of the Commonwealth Parliamentary Association met Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe while on a three-day tour in Sri Lanka.
The multiparty delegation’s presence will strengthen bonds with an important Commonwealth partner with which Canada has deep and longstanding, economic, social and people-to-people ties, the Canadian High Commission said in a release.
The delegation is led by Yasmin Ratansi, MP. She is accompanied by Matthew Jeneroux, MP, Thomas Mulcair MP, Sen. Salma Ataullahjan and Sen. Marilou McPhedran. In welcoming the delegation, the High Commissioner of Canada David McKinnon stated: “the Government of Canada believes that the Commonwealth plays an important role in promoting and upholding its core values of respect for democracy, human rights and the rule of law, which are critical for the development, prosperity and well-being of all countries.
This visit will reinforce the historic ties between our two countries and their national parliaments, and allow for an exchange of views on the progress on peace and reconciliation, which is crucial to Sri Lanka’s future. ”
In that regard, the Chair of the Canadian Branch of the Commonwealth Parliamentary Association, Yasmin Ratansi MP, stated: “I am pleased to be leading another delegation of Canadian parliamentarians to Sri Lanka. This will be my second visit in 2017 and I look forward to another opportunity to advance economic and political ties, discuss the role of the Commonwealth in today’s world, and to see first-hand the progress being made in reconciliation.
The delegation will meet with a range of senior ministers, officials, civil society leaders and the Canada-Sri Lanka business community. The delegation will also visit a Canadian-funded International Organization for Migration (IOM) project in Ratnapura, providing humanitarian and reconstruction support to those most affected by the devastating floods earlier this year.
