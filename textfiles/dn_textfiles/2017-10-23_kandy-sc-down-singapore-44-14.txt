Kandy SC down Singapore 44-14

Kandy Sports Club pulled off a creditable 44 points to 14 win over Singapore before a poor crowd at Nittawela on Saturday. At half time the winners led 27-7. The 44 points for Kandy came off 4 goals, 2 tries and 2 penalty kicks at goal to 14 points (2 goals).
The Singapore team had more overseas players than locals. Fazil Marija and the rest of the three-quarters did well to keep a hand on the ball and put the Singaporeans on the back foot. What the Kandy SC side did in this game was superb, they stuck to their plan, playing brilliant rugby.
Scorers for Kandy were Fazil Marija (two) and one each from Richard Dharmapala, Anurudda Wilwara, Dhanushka Ranjan and Nigel Ratwatte. Of four goals Ratwatte and Arshad Jamaldeen kicked one each. For the losers Johnson Darber and Peter Williams scored a try each and the goal kicking came off the boot of Johnson Darber.
Referee: Priyantha Gunaratne
