Metropolitan Telecom services launches feature phone Micromax X1i 2017

Metropolitan Telecom Services, the fastest growing communications and handset distributors in Sri Lanka, unveiled the new Micromax X1i 2017, catering to the surge in demand for feature phones.
Introduced at an attractive price point, the phone is getting the attention of a new generation of consumers who opt for a feature phone as their second phone as well as among budget conscious consumers who want a sleek and sturdy phone with minimum investment.
The device has a 2.4-inch colour screen and an alphanumeric keypad, featuring a 11 Hour battery life on standby and 8 hours of talk-time on a single charge depending on the network conditions. In terms of storage, the device has 32MB of internal storage that can be expanded up to 8GB.
Sanjeev Ariaratnam, Director for Metropolitan Telecom Services, said, “in spite of tremendous growth in smartphone sales in Sri Lanka, feature phones continue to represent a large opportunity for mobile handset makers like Micromax. And despite the array of smartphones available in the market, functional benefits are still making the conventional feature phone an attractive alternative.”
With two colour options available, blue or black, the phone also contains a headphone jack, SD card slot, VGA camera, FM radio, Bluetooth and Dual SIM. All of which are packed into a small handset.
E.M Tharindra Niroshan, Brand Manager for Metropolitan Telecom Services, said, “the Micromax Xi1 2017 reflects our ambition and commitment towards honouring the hallmarks of the true Micromax feature phone experience. Sri Lanka is one of the top emerging markets when it comes to mobile phones, and we are experiencing on-going demand for durable and easy-to-use feature phones.”
The Micromax Xi1-2017 is available islandwide through the Metropolitan dealer network.
