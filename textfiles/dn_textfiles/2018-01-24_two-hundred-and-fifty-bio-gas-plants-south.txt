Two hundred and fifty bio-gas plants for the South

Two hundred and fifty bio-gas plants would be set up in the Southern region to encourage house owners, industrialists and others, to use bio-gas energy instead of electricity.
Fifty percent of the cost of setting up of the bio-gas plants would be borne by the Electricity and Power Ministry, while the balance 50 percent would be borne by those who obtain bio-gas benefits.
Sources at the Southern region electricity board said funds have currently been given to set up 35 bio-gas plants by the private sector, while arrangements to set up another 95 bio-gas plants have been made. The project would reach its climax within a period of three years.
