Where Shakespeare abides today

People were tired and somewhat disappointed watching touring company of Shakespeare on the roadside, in the open countryside, vacant spots in around Shakespeare country and the patronage was dropping fast.
Something had to be done.
Growing interest of audience, actors, directors etc; frustrated their desire The identity of a national theatre became an obsession. The fate of arts and acting on improvised theatre needed a plush setting as well as the properly lit stage to support various scenes with props on which popularity would blossom and enhance the story and dialogue value.
Thus began the road to stardom.
Gone were the days of bare stages and travelling theatre with intensity cast overacting which were to produce thespians in near future. Theatre had to be part of their culture that would earn its place in British history, eventually.
THE GLOBE
The most popular of all theatres especially with today's audience, the Globe theatre in 1599 where Shakespeare had a share. This is sited in Southwark on the south bank of Thames. It burnt down accidentally during a performance of HENRY 111, rebuilt and opened again in 1641. Thirty years later the Puritans pulled it down for no reason.
Then came the saviour in the form of Sam Wanamaker, the Hollywood actor and director who was a passionate devotee of Shakespeare and his plays. Arriving in England, he started looking over the original site of the Globe in 1940 but the locals knew little about its history. However, he found a plaque that indicated the site and went about in determination to rebuild the Globe that was a going to be his tribute to the Bard whose works fascinated him. The Shakespeare Globe Trust was set up with Prince Phillip as Patron and Wanamaker as Chief Executive. Fundraising Committees were set up in the United States, Canada, New Zealand, Australia, Japan, India and Germany with Friends of Shakespeare's Globe. All financial hurdles were overcome and the final phase of the building started in June 1922. Tragically, Wanamaker died in 1993 deprived of seeing his dream reaching the last brick but the whole world knows that The Globe is his beautiful dream come true.
THE OLD VIC
In 1818 a theatre named Royal Cobourg was built at the Junction of Waterloo Road and Cut south of Thames and later renamed the Royal Victoria and in its place stand The Old. Vic. This theatre had a turbulent early history but under the guidance of Emma Cons, it modulated in 1880 to the Royal Victoria Hall. Con's niece, Lillian Bails volunteered to help. She was just twenty-three years of age and in 1914, chose to present Shakespeare as well as popular operas in the theatre with its gaslit stage. This went well under such directors like Ben Grist and Robert Atkins. By autumn of 1923 the tercentenary year of the First Folio, every play the canon had been performed by such actors like Sybil Thorndyke, Ion Swinley, Edith Evans etc. The new director, Harcourt Williams in 1929 commissioned the young John Gielgud as the leading man during two renowned seasons, with the help of such big names as that of Peggy Ashcroft, Tyrone Gutheri, Charles Laughton, Flora Robson and many others. The theatre established itself in 1930. In 1937 Laurence Olivier's HAMNET and Henry V announced the emergence of a major Shakespeare theatre. After so much of dedication and perseverance to promote theatre to the vibrant image, Lilian Baylis died later the same year but not before she saw the Vic become in effect a National Theatre. Then came the devastation; the theatre was bombed and the company moved to the New Theatre (known as Albery today) from 1944 to the spring of 1950. Later under the direction of Olivier, Richardson, and director John Burrell were the years of Olivier's famous RICHARD III (1944) the two Henry IV chronicles (1945). Steadily Shakespeare characters emerged gloriously to capture the imagination of the audiences. In 1949 another old Vic sprang up at the Theatre Royal in Bristol and HAMLET was directed by Michael Redgrave.
This was followed by the opening of the Waterloo Road theatre under Hugh Hunt. With the passing of many summers, The Old Vic was the monument for other subsidiary theatres, some of which survived while the others faded away. The National Company left for its new theatre while the Prospect Company appeared under The Old Vic. PROSPECT became known officially as The Old Vic Company in 1979.
THE NATIONAL THEATRE
Until the completion of their own theatre which took nearly thirteen years from 1963, the National Theatre put up with the OLD VIC in readiness at the South Bank. Despite the National Theatre being suggested as far back as 1848, the work did not commence until 1969, after a false start in 1951. The first Chairman of the South Bank Theatre Board, set up in 1962 to oversee the building of the theatre. The three theatres in all contained nearly 2500 seats. Lord Oliver Littleton was a director from 1963 - 1973 followed by Sir Peter Hall who took over until 1988. It was also in 1988 that the National Theatre gained a Royal charter.
OPEN AIR FESTIVAL
Twelfth Night was the first play to be launched at the OPEN AIR FESTIVAL at Regent's Park by Australian actor who masterminded the idea, Sydney Carrol along with director, Robert Atkins. This was in 1932 and despite the losses of £560, Carrol was given the opportunity to establish a theatre in the Inner Circle adjoining Queen Mary's Garden. As it is presently, the open air stage was backed by a screen of poplar with a marquee on hand for inclement weather. Carrol who reshaped the stage planted trees and hired deckchairs along with long benches that drew the first audience of nearly 2500 people. He lost £3000 but he was not disappointed. Determine to secure a financial future, sought funding from the Arts Council. A year later, the Company had its first overseas tour. Director, David Conville associated with theatre for more than thirty years featuring some of the world's leading thespians.
Established in 1986 by the director, Michael Bogdanov, the ESC along with actor, Michael Pennington, their inaugural production was Henry IV. They toured throughout the world to great success and acclaim and added four new productions to form the WAR OF ROSES which is Shakespeare's complete history cycle and for which Michael Bondanov won the Olivier award as Best Producer. Over fifteen plays were performed in the next six years including a tour of four African countries. This included a special adaption of Macbeth along with Coriolanus and The Winter's Tale.
STRATFORD- ONTAAIO
One of the greatest tributes paying homage to non-Canadian William Shakespeare is the Stratford- Ontario that fired the imagination of local journalist, Tom Patterson, the possibility of an annual Shakespeare Festival in the Canadian Stratford, took place at small Ontario town by the Canadian Avon.
Tyrone Gaucherie tempted by unexpected ideas agreed immediately to come down from England to direct an Elizabethan play evolved by Tanya Moiseiwitch. Originally the festivals were held in a large tent but summer 1953, Alec Guinness acted Richard 111 with Irene as Helena in Allswell That Ends Well which were Guthrie's favourite plays. It was a beginning of a dream to all Shakespeare-loving Canadians and became the home all North American audiences. There were a variety of administrators of high profile like Tyrone, Gutherie, Michael Laughton, Jean Gascon and Robin Phillips. The stage remained in its original form as a Stratford creation and during its thirty years, the Shakespeare Folio was very consistent. The summer festival was given international fame to its inconspicuous town and is still under director Phillips.
SAM WANAMAKER CBE 1919 - 1993
The new Globe in Southwark is the work of many people and the dream of one man.
When the young American actor came to London in 1949, he set out to visit the site of Shakespeare's Globe and was amazed to find that the only testimony to its existence was a blackened bronze plaque on the wall of a brewery. He conceived of a fitter memorial to the great playwright, a replica of the Globe itself.
Sam Wanamaker's enthusiasm, tenacity and energy inspired a worldwide effort to rebuild the Globe as faithfully as scholarship and craftsmanship could achieve, only a few hundred yards from where Shakespeare's original stood. As you visit the new Globe you are witnessing the fulfilment of Sam's dream.
