Rooted  in emotions

The two collections of varying types of narratives written by Jhumpa Lahiri, namely Interpreter of Maladies (first published in India and later in the USA) and the Unaccustomed Earth take me as a reader to a world of pathos and excitement that makes a moment of palpitations culminating in a vision beyond mere storytelling.
Out of the two narratives, I began reading the Interpreter that contains nine long stories that encompass the lives of many an Indians settled either in the UK or the USA. Jhumpa Lahiri who was born in London to Bengali parents was raised in Rhode Island, USA. She narrates episodes from the lives of Indians in exile. Some returning to the native soil from time to time, sometimes featured as alien perhaps uprooted and in search of their roots. One fascinating experience unfolds in the narrative titled as ‘Interpreter of Maladies’ in the collection of the same title.
Sandwiched cultures
Here the same reader encounters the delicate experiences of Mr and Mrs Das who visit India with their children grown up in the US. Though the children are depicted as alien, seeing monkey roaming around, the parents are sandwiched between two cultures. They are on their way to see the Sun Temple at Konark. They are taken to see the place by one driver cum guide named Mr Kapasi.
It is more or less the dialogue between Mrs Das and Mr Kapasi that matters. Mr Kapasi seems to reveal his other profession such as working with a medical doctor. He reveals the fact that he is an interpreter. Mrs Das wants to know more and more about this profession instead of enjoying her visit. This paved the way to reveal whether it is fact or fiction these innermost feelings of both of them. A reader may find that the inner layer in the fairly long narrative makes a palpitating effect rather than a track-ending storyline.
The narrative encourages the reader to know which one desired rather than what is forcefully suppressed by restraint. In this same collection, the opening narrative titled ‘A Temporary Matter’ revolves around a newly married Indian couple who live presumably in a foreign strand facing day to day encumbrances while the wife is expecting a child. It is the episodic narrative of Shaba and Shukumar. A notice reached them to know that for five days their electricity would be cut off for one hour, beginning at 8 pm. A line had gone down in the last snowstorm and the repairmen were going to take advantage of the milder evenings to set it right.
Inner feelings
The work would affect only the houses on the quiet tree-lined street, within walking distance of a row of brick-faced stores and a trolley shop, where Shoba and Shukumar had lived for three years. The narrative of Lahiri revolves around the issues faced by them in order to make their lives happy and content. They at times engage in seated discussions or trying to devise a game of revealing their inner feelings to each other. They engage in cooking, drinking and flashing back to their own lives. They too are like the characters in most other stories. They are either uprooted or disturbed. The culmination and the high point in the narrative are that Shoba gives birth to a dead child about whom they take the least.
Moving on to the other collection of Lahiri’s narratives, I found the title story, Unaccustomed Earth, as one of the most sensitive, enlightening and humane narratives that had been gifted to the world of English readers around the world. The narrative rests on the life of a young Indian woman, Ruma, living with her husband who moves from place to place as his profession demands. Ruma is visited by her father who teaches various types of activities to her little son. The link that exists between the grandfather and the grandson develops into a world of vision that cannot be explained in the definition and/or concepts. This could only be perceived as a testament of emotional wisdom.
On reading the narrative, I constantly remembered the dictum of Mark: wherever the man goes, he is bound by chains. In the narrative, the protagonist, Ruma, is featured as a woman bound by chains. One sensitive factor is laid in the following words:
In New York, after Akash [her son] was born, she had negotiated a part-time schedule at her law firm, spending Thursdays and Fridays at home in Park Slope and this had seemed like the perfect balance. The firm had been tolerant at first, but it had not been so easy, dealing with her mother’s death, just as an important case was about to go to trial. She [mother] had died on the operating table of heart failure. Ruma faces the bereavement but tries to overcome.
In this narrative, the side of her father too is brought to the forefront as a person who lives alone. But Ruma and her father who lives miles away talk on the phone. This temporary relief is eased off more when the father arrives to share the living conditions of Ruma and her son. I felt that Lahiri never attempts to sentimentalise or create overemotional situations in her narratives. Instead, she creates lasting simple episodes of living conditions, where the inner layer is much more important than the outer layer. As such, these narratives in the two collections are good examples of a creative process, possessive of a sensitive expression of human experiences.
