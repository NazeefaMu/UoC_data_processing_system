HMD Global wins ‘Consumer Smartphone of the Year’ award

Finnish smartphone brand HMD Global was recently awarded the EISA Consumer Smartphone 2018-2019 by Expert Imaging and Sound Association (EISA), a group comprising 53 of the world’s most respected consumer electronics magazines from 25 countries.
The jury chose HMD Global’s Nokia 7 Plus for its striking design, powerful performance and impressive imaging capabilities, after testing it against stiff competition in one of the most sought-after categories at the awards. The brand was also recognised for its commitment to quality, design and performance.
In a statement, EISA said that “by ensuring all its components work in perfect harmony with the Android One software platform, HMD Global [had] created a smartphone that users will surely recommend to friends for its incredible reliability.”
“We are thrilled to receive this year’s ‘EISA Consumer Smartphone Award,” said Gayan Wijethilaka, Head of Marketing at HMD Sri Lanka. “This prestigious accolade represents a solid recognition from the industrynot only for the Nokia 7 Plus but also for the entire suite of HMD mobile devices.”
“Despite the competitive smartphone market space, the Nokia 7 Plus has been well-received, which has reinforced our confidence to develop further trend-setting devices which excel in design and performance for people in Sri Lanka and around the globe,” Wijethilaka added.
The award will be formally presented to HMD Global during IFA, the world’s largest consumer electronics fair, at the EISA Awards ceremony on August 31 in Berlin.
