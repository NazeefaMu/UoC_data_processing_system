Death of two-year-old: Homicide verdict returned; four suspects arrested

The Maligawatte Police had commenced an investigation into information received that the parents of a small boy who had died under mysterious circumstances at the flats located on Hijjra Mawatha, Colombo 10 were preparing to hold the funeral at around 5 pm yesterday.
Colombo City Coroner Iresha Deshani Samaraweera who conducted the post mortem investigations into the death returned a verdict of homicide.
She ordered the Maligawatte Police to file action against the suspects before the Magistrate’s Courts.
Earlier yesterday, when a group of police officers had visited the house, the parents of two-year-old Mohammed Ali Mohammed Usman Ikam, had told police that the child had died due to high blood sugar levels.
However, investigations had revealed that there was a burn wound on the left foot of the deceased child while the police had notified the Akluthkade Number 04 Court about the suspicious circumstances regarding the death of this child and the court had issued an order to conduct the post-mortem examinations.
Examinations at the Coroner’s Court revealed that the Ikam was adopted by the two individuals in whose house the child was found dead. In the wake of the Coroner’s report, the police arrested the couple who had adopted the child as well as his biological parents. They are to be produced before the Aluthkade court today (16).
Police investigations revealed that with the death of the child, the adopted parents had tried to bury him but the neighbours in the area had suspected a crime and they had immediately notified the police emergency hotline of the death. As a result the Maligawatte police had come to the home of the suspects.
Colombo Judicial Medical Officer, S.D. Wasantha Perera who conducted the post-mortem examination on the child ruled the cause of death to be a blow to his head with a blunt weapon. It was this report that he presented before the Coroners’ Court.
Ikam had been adopted by the suspects two years ago from a couple living in Kahawatte.
The adopted mother, Mohamed Fathima Safana (30), giving evidence before the Colombo Coroner stated that she had two other children and that she had a letter from his biological parents stating that they have given custody of the child to them.
On 11 April 2018, the child had fainted and they had taken him to a private hospital, where the doctors said that he had high blood sugar levels. They had admitted the child in hospital and later when he had vomited, she had taken him to wash his legs.
“He cried out and it is then I noticed that the water was hot”, she said explaining the burn injuries on the child’s foot.
Thereafter on May 14 once again, the child had fainted and the couple stated that, the second time they found him dead. They had tried to get death certificates from two doctors in a private hospital but they had refused.So they tried to bury him in secret. It is then that the Police arrived in their home.
When the Coroner asked if any of them had previous cases against them, Safana said that her husband had a case lodged against him in 2013, for having assaulted his two children from a previous marriage. The two children are currently in probationary care.
