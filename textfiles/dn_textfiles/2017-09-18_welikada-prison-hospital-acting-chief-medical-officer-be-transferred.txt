Welikada Prison Hospital Acting Chief Medical Officer to be transferred

 
Welikada Prison Hospital Acting Chief Medical Officer Dr. N. Thenuwara who is alleged to have approved to give preferential treatment to politicians, was advised to be transferred to the National Hospital by Health Minister Rajitha Senaratne.
The Health Minister gave instructions today in response to the request made by nineteen Welikada Prison Hospital Medical Officers.
On September 11, Prison Reforms, Rehabilitation Resettlement and Hindu Religious Affairs Minister D. M. Swaminathan said that he decided to make a ‘three doctor’ consent mandatory for prison inmate hospitalization after considering numerous complaints received by him from various sections of society that the prison inmate hospitalisation process is flawed.
