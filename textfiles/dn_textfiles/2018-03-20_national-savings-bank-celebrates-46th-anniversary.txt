Marking 46 years of financial strength and stability, a series of events has been organised to commemorate the 46th anniversary of National Savings Bank (NSB), with the main event at the Head Office premises held on March 16, with a number of programs held at Branch level.

National Savings Bank was mandated to inculcate the virtue of saving among the people; especially among the rural sector. Today, the Bank celebrates the achievements of the past 46 years as an institution which has created a solid savings base for the country and made the people the partners in the country’s development agenda.
The success of the Bank is attributed to its prompt response, innovative measures, trust, mutual respect and integrity extended to the different classes of depositors, particularly those in the rural sector. Millions of people of this country who have chosen NSB as their savings and banking partner confirm that we have acted in line with our vision and the interests of our valued customers and all the other stakeholders.
