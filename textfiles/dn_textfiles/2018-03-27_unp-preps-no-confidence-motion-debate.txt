UNP preps for No-confidence motion debate

 
The Prime Minister has requested United National Party MPs who are in China as part of parliamentary delegation to cut short their visit and return to the country before April 1 so that the party may focus its attention on the non-confidence motion which is expected to be taken up for debate in the house on April 4.
The Daily News reliably learns that the Working Committee meeting scheduled for Thursday this week would also focus on the non-confidence motion and internal changes with the party. It is also believed that the selection of office bearers maybe be discussed.
UNP MPs including Ranjan Ramanayake, Dr Kavindu Jayawardene, Dr Tusitha Wijemanne and Rohini Kumari Wijeratne are currently in China as part of a delegation headed by Speaker Karu Jayasuriya.
The delegation was originally expected to return to the country on April 3.
