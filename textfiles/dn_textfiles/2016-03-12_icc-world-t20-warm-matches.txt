ICC World T20 warm-up matches

[Sri Lanka men lose, women win]
Sri Lanka once again suffered at the hands of Colin Munro who already hit the second fastest fifty in Twenty20 against them when he clobbered a 21-ball fifty (inclusive of six sixes) as New Zealand won their ICC World T20 warm-up match by 74 runs at Mumbai.
New Zealand batting first rattled up 226-4 and Sri Lanka replied with 152-7.
Tim Southee and Anderson displayed seam and swing at good pace to make the opening combination of Tillakaratne Dilshan and Dinesh Chandimal more circumspect.
Dilshan had his leg stump pushed back after he was trumped by a perfect late and quick inswinger from Anderson.
Chandimal, who admitted he takes his time to get settled, was beaten by the extreme pace and movement of Adam Milne, who replaced Southee in the fourth over. The rest of the Sri Lankan batsmen, too, failed to make any impact.
Scores: New Zealand 226-4 in 20 overs (M Guptill 41, C Munro 67, C Anderson 60 rtd out, G Elliott 36 n.o., D Shanaka 2/48)
Sri Lanka 152-7 in 20 overs (L Thirimanne 41, C Kapugedera 38, A Mathews 25 n.o., A Milne 3/26, I Sodhi 2/19)
[Women’s match]
In Bengaluru, Sri Lanka skittled Bangladesh for 95 with one ball to spare after electing to field and then surpassed the modest target in 18.1 overs.
Nigar Sultana played a lone hand for Bangladesh with 33 as seamer Oshadi Ranasinghe claimed three wickets for 14 runs and Eshani Lokusuriyage took two for 17.
Sri Lanka was coasting at 49 for one when Bangladesh fought back with three wickets in the space of eight runs, but Ranasinghe and Lokusuriyage teamed up again to steer their side home.
Ranasinghe returned unbeaten on 18 and Lokusuriyage made 16 not out after leg-spinner Rumana Ahmed claimed three wickets for nine runs in four overs.
