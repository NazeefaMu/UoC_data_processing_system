KANDY SPORTS ROUND UP:
Kandy SC take on CR at Nittawela

Kandy Sports Club will take on CR & FC at Nittawela today in what promises to be a good game for the defending champions who have won all their matches in the inter league competition. Kandy SC are technically capable of winning the game at home and are at virtual full strength with a pack and half backs that will put the opponents to the test. Kandy SC plans to name a strong side and a more experimental line-up at home. The play of the forwards has been particularly impressive. These forwards have delivered arguably their best performance in the last eight games.

The Red shirts will struggle to give their best in this game as it will be a tough one against a Kandy SC side who are an extremely strong physically.

Billiards and Snooker not promoted the correct way
Billiards and Snooker a onetime popular sport in Kandy is now in the doldrums with no one showing any interest. The game is not promoted in the way it should be. At one time the game of Billiards and Snooker was the number one recreational sport for many people here, but has sadly declined in recent times. Today at club level, the game is dead. Kandy YMMA one time a leading cue club does not seem to be interested. Kings Cue Club which earned a name through cue sport is no more. In the good old days every hotel which had a public bar had tables like Royal, Castle, Victory, but no longer. Today the game is popular only at parlours. Only clubs like Mahanuwara YMBA the most active club in the game and Public Services Club are active. Other clubs like University Recreation Club, Kandy Club, and Kandy Garden Club have tables for their members to play the game but surprisingly there are no tournaments. Some clubs use the cue room as their store room and play billiards and snooker to get the liquor permit. This is cue sport in Kandy.
