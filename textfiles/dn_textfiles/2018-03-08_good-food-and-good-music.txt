Good food and good music!

The Waters Edge Brew and Grub Fest was held on February 23, 24 and 25 at the Grand Lawn. Thousands gathered on the three days for evenings of good food, music courtesy of Magic Box Mix-Up, Infinity and Monkey Wings, and lots of good times. Here are some highlights from the first day of the event.
