Peradeniya university re-opens

The University of Peradeniya which was shut down on April 3 following a viral flu outbreak, will re-open today, Vice Chancellor Prof. Upul Dissanayake said.
Following the outbreak of the viral flu in early April, over 3,000 students had sought treatment from the university medical unit as well as nearby government hospitals prompting the university administration to go for a temporary closure of the institution.
Vice Chancellor of the University, Upul Dissanayake earlier said he had taken the decision to close the university following recommendations by an advisory committee comprising all the Deans at the university.
On that occasion he had explained that the measure had been taken to control the spread of the viral flu.The University administration was planning to close the University for the Sinhala and Tamil New Year from April 9, but had to close earlier given the grave health situation.
