INCREASE OF STATE BANK PENSION
As a Bank of Ceylon pensioner I wish to express my utmost gratitude to the bank and its General Manager for the increase of our members' pensions with effect from January this year. It was done by the bank in an unexpected manner especially, at a time when we are facing many financial difficulties due to high cost of living.
Generally, the bank increases staff salaries every three years according to the collective agreement that had been signed by the bank with the Ceylon Bank Employees’ Union. Accordingly, the last salary increase was granted to them in January 2016. But pensioners have been granted their respective increase after and year and half later. Even though, bank employees had received their full arrears since the date there salary was increased pensioners have not been given their full arrears. Instead the bank paid them only six months arrears even though they are entitled to one year arrears. It is very regrettable to state that many of our members die every year without enjoying their salary increases due to this reason.
Therefore, I earnestly request from the authorities concern to look in to this matter on the ground of humanitarian level since other pensioners like government and Central Bank get their pension increased on the same day without any time differences.
I wish to state that increasing of salaries to the pensioners has to be done without considering their grade in the bank they held. If the pensioners had been granted same amount without a grade bank could have saved it money in the Pension Trust Fund.
