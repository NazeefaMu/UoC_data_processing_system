Thyroxine for life?
When I asked the panel of doctors, chaired by Dr. Amal Harsha De Silva, Deputy Director General for Health Services, at the Medicare exhibition held recently at the BMICH, inter alia, whether there is any permanent cure for hyper-thyroidism, the learned doctor/pediatrician Prof Sanath Lamabadusuriya said in response that it is Thyroxine for life and that there is no permanent cure as such and also mentioned that the drug prescribed for this hormone deficiency is very cheap. He also went on to say that all the babies, about 360,000 born annually (if I remember right) will have to undergo the relevant test for thyroid issues in the near future.
Maybe, that is true for Allopathy about the non-availability of a permanent cure but I am writing this letter to know whether there is any permanent cure in Homeopathy or Ayurveda or any other native medical practice.
