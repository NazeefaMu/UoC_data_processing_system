Nestlé Lanka celebrates Avurudu with employees

Nestlé recently celebrated Avurudu at its head office, with the participation of the company’s Managing Director, Shivani Hegde, and employees. The Avurudu activities commenced with a traditional Avurudu breakfast followed by the lighting of the oil lamp, ‘kiri ithireema’, ‘ganu denu’ at the ‘gemi gedara’, and a mix of traditional and non-traditional Avurudu games, such as, ‘kana mutti’, ‘kotta pora’, ‘keta geheema’, pinning the eye on the elephant, coconut scraping contest, lime and spoon race, Nestomalt drinking contest, and ‘onchili pedima’.
Nestlé also celebrated Avurudu with millions of consumers across the country with more than 150 Avurudu festivals (Bakmahé Ran Kedella) through its flagship brand Nestomalt, which has consistently been a powerful part of the Avurudu celebrations in Sri Lanka.
