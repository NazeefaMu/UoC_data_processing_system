Special programmes to suppress underworld

The government has implemented special programmes to suppress the underworld,the Department of Government Information said in a release yesterday.
They asked that the public not get carried away with reports that there was a breakdown of law and order in the country due to actions of a few individuals connected to the underworld.
Maithripala Sirisena and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe have paid special attention to this, and a special committee appointed on it has instructed the police on action that needs to be taken to arrest the situation in the underworld, they added further.
One of the recommendations implemented was to strengthen the Police Intelligence Unit further to gather information on the underworld better.
Accordingly, special Police teams consisting of members from the Organized Crime Division and Special Task Force have been deployed to monitor areas such as Colombo and surrounding areas which have high rates of crime.
Enforcement teams have also been established in all 10 divisions in the Western Province and officers in civil as well as in uniform will be operating in these areas. They have been allowed to set up instant police checkpoints to conduct investigations.
Through these operations, the Police in the past few days were able to arrest several major underworld criminals along with their weapons. Police Intelligence is also investigating into information that a Sri Lankan national attached to the underworld is running criminal activities in the country from abroad and the police is to take action in the near future to arrest these individuals abroad with the assistance of Interpol.
The government has also taken measures to control the illegal drug trade in the country and a Special Drugs and Organised Crime Division has been set up to prosecute these individuals.
