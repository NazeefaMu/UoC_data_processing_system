One-stop-shop for health and beauty

People from all walks of life and age groups are now highly concerned of their beauty and physique today. Beauty salons and gyms have mushroomed everywhere to cater to these needs. They are found in every nook and corner in the country.
Many beauty salons in Sri Lanka, being me-too products, are very western oriented. They stick to common marketing tactics to serve their customers.
It is true that the local consumer segment that represents the masses could be enticed by a westernized approach since their aspirations are such. Yet exclusive up market clienteles and niche markets always yearn for factors such as emotional or intangible benefits a product or a service offers in addition to tangible benefits or physical product attributes.
‘Beauty Zone’ Salon situated in the heart of Kadawatha has a different approach towards its clients. It adheres to Sri Lankan traditions paying emphasis on hospitality that leads to lifelong relationships.
Sri Lanka is a country that has a lineage for the best traditions and hospitality bestowed upon it by its rich culture. The Buddhist culture has imparted us with qualities to make humble and honest relationships with people. The Seri Vaanija Jathaka story sheds light on a door-to-door seller called Kachchaputa who had practiced Relationship Marketing.
Beauty Zone has grasped that tradition to treat its patrons cordially as guests.
“Beauty especially in women is not skin deep. Beauty comes from within. We at Beauty Zone treat our visitors as guests thus we educate them on many factors that contribute towards maintaining beauty”, says Beauty Zone Director Indika De Silva who has been a professional architect. Sanjaya Alahakoon is the co-director.
“Architecture is a subject that harmonizes with aesthetics. After indulging in it for many years I wanted to diversify into the salon business which too goes hand-in-hand with aesthetics. Similar to architecture the salon industry too is a scientific art. In Sri Lankan history, the barbers used to come to Walawwas to do haircuts. I was inspired by this concept to start Beauty Zone. Our customers whom we treat as guests should feel at home and have a special feeling once they step into our premises. Physical evidence, procedures and service providers play a vital role here”, says Indika.
There is no cash counter to be seen at Beauty Zone. Ample space and homely atmosphere prevails. The soothing ambience is in abundance with greenery. Cosmetics kept on a canoe at the midst of the salon are the centre of attraction. Visitors feel they are in a user-friendly domestic environment.
Fashion cuts, fashion colours, hair treatments, facials, clean ups, manicures/pedicures, threading and waxing, face lifting treatments, whitening treatments, pimple treatments, makeup, hair styles and many more services are on offer for the guests who visit Beauty Zone seeking for exclusiveness.
“Unlike in earlier decades people are now self-educated on the subject of beauty. Social media has done this revolution. When they visit us with this knowledge, we must have the capacity to captivate them with our services. Newcomers often come with pre-decided products to be used on them.
Yet we always guide them to use the right product that best suits his/her personality, skin colour and habits”, Indika stressed. Beauty Zone does not rely on branding or pamphlets to promote its business. Their loyal customers are their promoters.
“We use a top Italian brand of cosmetics which is a world top brand with international green standards coupled with specialized services that do no harm to the skin. Ours is the only salon that uses this brand in Kadawatha. Hence our guests get value for their money and gain exclusiveness while enjoying peace in mind. Contented customers become our ambassadors by spreading positive word-of-mouth,” he added.
Beauty Zone benchmarks with latest global trends to maintain uniqueness. Nail art is a brand new service that is on offer. Neon-Coloured Hair Colouring which is visible only in the dark is in store for early adopters.
According to Indika ‘phase two’ of his venture is to unveil a Slimming and Skin Toning section with an in-house dietician.
“Personality development has a big market potential now. More than ladies, gents will be lured towards this in future.
People who have obesity will be guided to reduce their ‘body fat’ not only by adhering to plug and burn methods but also by practicing better food habits and water intake,” he said.
Also, world famous beauty products from Italy and Australia will be introduced to up market clients via Beauty Zone.
Thus Beauty Zone is poised to offer a complete solution under one roof to its guests as a one-stop-shop in Kadawatha.
“While promoting green habits, we work towards achieving the US Green Building certificate for Beauty Zone”, Indika concluded.
