Rapid agriculture revolution from October: President

President Maithripala Sirisena said the entire country will be subjected to a rapid agriculture revolution from October to gain significant progress in the agricultural sector.
The President asked all to get ready for this giant leap and to contribute to the national drive. Accordingly, the first week of October will be named as the Jathika Govi Sathiya. All Ministries will be a part of this national move.
“With the onset of rain, a programme under the theme Waga Sangramaya will be launched countrywide aiming to cultivate 800,000 hectares of lands.”
The President made these observations after commissioning an Agriculture In Service Training Institute (ISTI) at Karadiyanaru, Batticaloa yesterday.
The ISTI in Karadiyanaru was first established in 1980 by the Agriculture Department aiming to provide specialized training to agriculture extension officers in the Eastern Province, practically oriented residential training for officers as well as farmers.
However, with the terror attack on the ISTI in 1986, the institute was dilapidated. The ISTI has been reconstructed at a cost of Rs 103 million allocated jointly by the European Union and the Sri Lankan Government.
When the President was requested by the political leadership of the area to allocate Rs 90 million for further development of the institute, the President said that he will take immediate measures to allocate Rs 25 million of the Rs 90 million this week itself. He promised to allocate the rest when the process is being carried out for the further development of the institute.
Addressing a large gathering, the President said the ISTI is important to agriculture areas such as Batticaloa. As an agriculture country, it is important to strengthen every aspect of the agriculture sector.
The President noted that the Government will provide the entire requirement of seed paddy. “The country needs 4,000,000 bushels per year and moves have already been taken to meet the entire requirement,” he added.
“We all are here to work for the development of the agriculture sector,” he noted while stating that he firmly believes that the future prosperity of the country depends mainly on agricultural developments.
“We are proud to mention that we have inherited an agricultural history. Therefore, more attention is needed towards agriculture development and the betterment of the people involved in the agriculture sector.”
The President noted that the farmer community is always ridden with various issues relating to agriculture such as water scarcity, lack of technology, financial burdens, land issues and more. It is important to increase the productivity of agricultural crops to ease the farmer community, who are ridden with those issues.
The Provincial Agriculture Ministries and the Agriculture Ministry of the Government are mainly responsible to take measures to increase the productivity of crops aiming to ease the burdens of the farmer community.
The farmers are among the main forces that contribute to the country’s economy and therefore the government takes the responsibility of safeguarding farmers while uplifting them, President Sirisena said.
The Government has paid more attention on the development of the Eastern Province.
The Presidential Secretariat has launched a programme to renovate 100 irrigation tanks in the Trincomalee district and of them 40 tanks have been renovated by now. He said he hopes to allocate funds for the renovation of tanks of the Batticaloa district.
A national agriculture action plan was prepared by this Government after coming to power. However, the plan could not be properly carried out due to the prevailing drought situation experienced by millions of people.
“We spend over Rs 3,100 millions monthly for providing facilities for 800,000 drought affected families. Agriculture production has reduced by 50 per cent due to the severe drought.”
The President said he is familiar with agriculture being a son of a farmer.
The President added that a friendly country will grant 250,000 MT of rice to be distributed among drought affected families by next month. The President said the country cannot depend on others and rice cannot be imported as it is a disgrace to the country.
