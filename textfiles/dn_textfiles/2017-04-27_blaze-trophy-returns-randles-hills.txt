Blaze trophy returns to Randles Hills

It was an amazing rugby encounter when two brother schools Kingswood College, Kandy and Wesley College met each other last Saturday at Bogambara Stadium. It was a brilliant encounter with both teams playing some excellent rugby to the excitement of the spectators where the Kingswoodians regained the trophy.
Kingswood was able to take back the trophy with just a one point win (40-39). It was nice to see their former sports master Ruben Wijayawardene gracing the occasion as the chief guest and handing over the trophy. He was 15 years as MIC of rugger, and 2 years POG and was also the Tournament Secretary of Sri Lanka School Rugby and Central Province Schools Rugby secretary.
This trophy means a lot as it was introduced in 1986, where the old Kingswoodian late Roy de Silva, a well-known sporting figure when he was the president of the Kingswood OBA donated it. The inaugural game for the trophy took place on 17 July 1986 and it was won by Kingwood who was led by Ronnie Ibrahim. Wesley was led by Sumedha Kuruppu.
Thereafter it became an annual fixture and two games were played except for the period between 2006 and 2012, when the series was interrupted due to unwanted incident at a match, and thus it was made one leg.
Lewis Edmund Blaze was a product of Trinity College, the founder of Kingswood College on 4 May 1891. At that time the school was named Kandy Boys High School and he was the founder principal. Wesley College was founded on 2 March 1874 by Rev. Daniel Henry Pereira, with Rev. Samuel Rose Wilkin as its founder Principal. Kingswood was the first school to play rugby in 1893 during that time there was no school involved in the game and after Trinity College took up the game the first inter school game was between Kingswood and Trinity in 1906 which ended in a six-all draw. Wesley started rugby in 1955 with Eddie Buell as captain.
So, in last Saturday’s game Kingswood and Wesley were equally superior in their type of play. Both schools, surprised everybody with their excellent display of run and passes rugby.
The Blaze trophy wining Kingswood team consisted of Heshan Jansen (captain), Lakshitha Ranaweera, Tharindu Oshada, Dimantha Weerasekara, Thavindu Siriwardana, Milan Weerasingha, Rimzan Alith, Rashmika Chandaratna, Shanuka Gedaragoda, Tharindu Waligampola, Hirushan Anuranga, Sachintha Seneviratne, Asiri Seneviratne, Sachintha Abeyratna, Ruchira Ekanayaka, Chathura Soysa, Thuwan Dilshan, Janitha Rajanayaka, Amantha Alwis, Dinesh Gamage - Coach and Indunil Wickramasinghe - trainer.
