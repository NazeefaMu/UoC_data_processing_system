THE COURT, A LEARNING PLACE

In my unending quench of searching for solutions to country’s ills, I thought to turn to my muse WILLIAM SHAKESPEARE. All of a sudden, it came to my mind from nowhere very unexpectedly, my favourite play in his oeuvre, “All’s well that ends well’’, my good professor of English Literature at the University of Sri Jayewardenepura Dr. A.J. Gunawardene once quipped us to dig out the priceless gems in it to serve the nation on a more academic vein. Therefore, I thought of paying a posthumous tribute to him by writing this article in one way and to throw some light on the status quo with regard to the judicial landscape in Sri Lanka in particular and in the world in general. On the other hand, how this great playwright has viewed the human behaviour on planet earth is veritably thought provoking that the whole world ought to harness his explanations to make a brand new world for the people to live in.
The present regime headed by President Maithripala Sirisena seems to be exploiting the great oeuvre by Shakespeare for the future well-being of our sacred land ransacked by fraudsters who say that if they would return to power once again they would revert to the same game, not all but some insane dunder heads.
True to my conscience, the court has been one of my fruitful places of learning since my formative years. My harmless madness to improve my English and knowledge about the world put me on a good stead.
Legal education
As an avid reader of English, I surveyed almost all the aspects of reading news and articles written by learned scholars related to legal education. It made me aware of most of the acts, laws, rules and regulations pertaining to ordinary living. The growing interest in this regard and my desire to appease my hunger made a magnetic effect on me to visit the nearby magistrate court to listen to the court proceedings.
Now I wonder many a time why I didn’t become a lawyer rather than a teacher and a writer. Thus, the court became my favorite learning place and I was able to garner a vast wealth of knowledge and a welter of information with regard to litigation and the delivery of judgment. Once a judge told a thief, “I hope you won’t see my face here again.” It is said that the thieves have a divinity for quick quips and he respectfully asked the judge, “Oh, my lord, are you going on transfer or retirement.”
This very incident enlightened my wits. By listening to much planed out arguments of the then lawyers, I learned many a legal term and improved my vocabulary. It is very poignant that I very recently witnessed that the standard of English of most of the lawyers is below the zero level. I hope that my opinion would be taken as solid rock truth but not contempt to the bench or bar. Once I asked from a leading lawyer at a magistrate court if he would not ‘Take Silk’. He promptly answered that he had no time on Poya day as his clients come to meet him. I couldn’t help laughing, yet managed to control my emotions.
I have been sitting on the benches at the back of the court listening to court cases for many hours. My favourite cases were murders. My unquenchable thirst made me a member of the jury later in my life and I enjoyed by giving my judgements on critical and complicated cases that were caught in law’s delays. To be brief on this count, the hours I spent at court houses rewarded me a lot to argue with police officers and escape punishment.
The recent scenario regarding fraudsters and politicians on the judicial landscape is of paramount importance. The heavy fines meted out to them at the public courts and a dozen of commissions could serve as deterrent if they take them in the right sense. The callous disregard to law and order of the country has dragged them into a treacherous bog of utter disgrace. Their political life is ruined.
Public officials
The million dollar question is that how they could appear before their voters again? Seemingly guarding angels of democracy and public interest have turned the foes of the nation. The Swords of Damocles are hanging over them. Least said sooner mended. Yet, the legal eagles of JAGGERS CALIBRE are having a field day in the absence of such as our legal luminary Dr. Colvin. Ill-gotten money is in rotation, from the purse of the politicians to the shrewd legal eagle.
The court is a good training ground for public officials and the police officers who take the rules unto themselves and harass the innocent public. In the recent past, very many public servants learnt bitter lessons for the crimes they had done being arrogant to the general public. Long years of imprisonment away from their near and dear ones would open the eyes of the arrogant bureaucracy.
The officers who are the guardians of the long arm of law almost get their careers terminated for authoritative manner of carrying out of their entrusted duties. It is heard that, at present, from top to bottom of the bureaucratic hierarchy give a second thought before stamping their great seal below the signature. That’s enough for the people from GOOD GOVERNANCE.
The general public is greatly benefited by the court as a learning place. Their legal education takes place there. Some litigants who came out from a magistrate court told me that they had learnt a lot from their cases, but economically ruined due to exorbitant charges the lawyers maintain. In a sense that is also reasonable because the lawyers are not benefited by EPF or any gratuity. They also have to spend a lot to become a lawyer and should have the creativity to fabricate untruth. In my presence one lawyer, now dead and gone told a criminal to tell him the truth that he would fabricate the lie on his behalf to win the case. Even one visit to a court could give you dividends. But many a tube light is also in the profession.
Court proceedings
To those whose wish is to become a lawyer one day, the court is an ideal learning place. The arguments of the veteran lawyers could widen the horizon of the listeners, but the poor performance of some lawyers made me discouraged. Teachers can garner much knowledge from the court if they at least step into a court once in a way. The recent court case before the Indian judiciary with regard to a child marriage is thought provoking.
Editors and news reporters gather a lot of information regarding the legality of their careers and improve the power of expression through court proceedings. I myself was profusely benefited by a case heard at a magistrate court to write a short story titled ‘JAILBIRD’ in this newspaper itself. The jailbird told the magistrate that it was the society that made him a criminal, and so he was innocent. For the enthusiastic language learner, the value of the court is immeasurable.
Even the judges and moreover even a retired chief justice, the court be a sacred learning place to reflect on his previous judgements to rejoice or lament as the case may be. Helping an accused is undone by using the great seal. Lawyers themselves could sharpen their teeth at the court in this learning process. The poets, the playwrights, writers and short story writers and also the cartoonists could gather authentic sources for writing.
To clinch over, the writer would like to bow down his head to the great playwright WILLIAM SHAKESPEARE for leaving behind this great utterance for us to see the world from a different angle.
The relevance of this great utterance is felt more at this juncture as the country is passing through a very crucial period of jurisdiction involving heavy weights in the sphere, veritably battle hardened with their wits.
