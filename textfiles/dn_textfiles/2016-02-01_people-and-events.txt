Holy Cross 1953/54 classmates celebrate 60th anniversary
The 1953/54 group of classmates of Holy Cross College, Kalutara, celebrated their 60th anniversary with a get-together at Panorama Hotel, Kalutara recently.
The Chief Guest was LLRC member and Missing Persons Commission head Maxwell Paranagama who is an old boy of Holy Cross College, Kalutara.
Holy Cross College, Kalutara Rector Rev. Fr. Carlton de Silva and Vice Rector Rev. Fr. Chrisantha Kumara also graced the occasion.
The meeting commenced with the singing of the college anthem and the observance of two minutes silence in remembrance of the departed classmates.
The Chief Guest was welcomed by Dr. Lucian Jayasuriya who garlanded him. In his address, Dr. Jayasuriya thanked the Chief Guest and his wife for accepting the invitation and attending the function.
He also thanked the organisers for keeping in touch with all classmates and organising these get-togethers continuously for six decades. He also noted the dwindling numbers in later years, - particularly Deshabandu Dr. Reggie Seimon, Rex de Silva and Evans Cooray who passed away last year - as all classmates are now Octogenarians or thereabouts.
The Chief Guest recalled his days spent at Holy Cross College along with his brothers.
Rev. Fr. de Silva said he was delighted to be in a group where classmates meet annually. He also said that he has never come across such a meeting of zealous classmates holding meetings continuously for such a long period.
Subsequently, singing of Christmas Carols and songs of yore were presented by the Group with music provided by an organist and a guitarist.
The Vote of Thanks was delivered by the chief organiser Percy de Silva. He also mentioned the past teachers who moulded the group for what they are today and mentioned that among the group are eminent doctors, lawyers, engineers, journalists, Members of Parliament, and even a Professor and a High Court Judge who all performed a yeoman service to the country during their hay days and brought honour to their Alma Mater!
The meeting culminated with lunch and all the members of the Group vowed to meet next year as well.
