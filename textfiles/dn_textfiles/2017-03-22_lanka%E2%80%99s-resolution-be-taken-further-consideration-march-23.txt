Lanka’s resolution to be taken up for further consideration on March 23

The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFA) does not anticipate there being any amendments to the United Nations Human Rights Council (UNHRC) resolution on Sri Lanka. The resolution, which has already been tabled, will be taken up for further consideration on March 23.
Tomorrow, the UNHRC will consider the report of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights on the promotion of reconciliation, accountability, and human rights in Sri Lanka. This will be the first complete evaluation of the country’s progress in improving its human rights record since Zeid Ra’ad Al Hussein, the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, visited the country in February 2016.
Hussein’s report will be taken up at the 34th Session of the UNHRC alongside those of the two UN Special Rapporteurs who visited the country last year.
