Corruption case against Kumara Welgama:
CIABOC to submit Commission’s written approval

Colombo Chief Magistrate Ranga Dissanayake yesterday ordered the Commission to Investigate Allegations of Bribery or Corruption (CIABOC) to submit the written approval of the Commission pertaining to the corruption case filed against former Transport Minister Kumara Welgama.
The Commission to Investigate Allegations of Bribery or Corruption charged that former Minister caused a loss to the government by appointing a Deputy Chairman to the Sri Lanka Transport Board (SLTB) contrary to the Transport Act.
The Bribery Commission alleged that the former Minister had unlawfully appointed L.A. Wimalaratne as the Deputy Chairman of the SLTB on June 23, 2010 when he was the Transport Minister.
The Bribery Commission further alleged that the former minister had paved the way to confer a payment of Rs.3.2 million to the Deputy Chairman as his salary and other benefits, causing a loss to the Government.
Attorneys appearing on behalf of former Minister Welgama stated that the Bribery Commission had filed action against their client without any written approval.
The Attorneys also pleaded to release their client from this corruption case. The Commission to Investigate Allegations of Bribery or Corruption had filed this case against former Minister Welgama under Section 70 of the Bribery Act under three charges. After taking the relevant facts into consideration, the Magistrate ordered the Bribery Commission to hand over the written approval before September 19.
