From crisis to sustenance – Part 20:The ‘Five practices of exemplary leadership’

Leadership does not just happen. Leaders are made, not born. Leadership is a set of skills and abilities that anyone can learn. Some may take a little more time than others. That is the only difference. Those skills can be strengthened, honed, and enhanced.
No one has said leadership is easy, but the rewards are great! In making the commitment to be a role model for our groups, to look positively at the future, to encourage our team members to be the best that they can be and then thank them for their efforts, we are fostering not only their development as leaders, but our own, while positively moving our team into the future.
In the past few weeks we have discussed the “Five Practices of Exemplary Leadership” which can make better leaders of us all. To recap, the Five Practices are:
1. Model the Way
2. Inspire a Shared Vision
3. Challenge the Process
4. Enable Others to Act
5. Encourage the Heart
Leaders who use these practices create higher-performing teams, increase sales and customer satisfaction levels, and foster renewed loyalty and greater organizational commitment.
We also considered each of the four attributes that compel people to follow a leader, including that the leader be honest, forward-looking, inspiring and competent. People who work with such leaders are significantly more satisfied, committed, energized, and productive.
Ten commitments
Today, we will begin exploring each of the 10 commitments of leadership. the commitments mapped to the practices:
These ten commitments are:
* Search out challenging opportunities to change, grow, innovate, and improve. (for Practice 1)
* Experiment, take risks, and learn from mistakes. (for Practice 1)
* Envision an uplifting and enabling future. (for Practice 2)
* Enlist others in a common vision by appealing to their interests, hopes, and dreams. (for Practice 2)
* Foster collaboration by promoting cooperative goals and building trust. (for Practice 3)
* Strengthen people by giving power away, providing choice, developing competence,
assigning critical tasks, and offering visible support (for Practice 3)
* Set the example by behaving in ways that are consistent with shared values. (for Practice 4)
* Achieve small wins that promote consistent progress and build commitment. (for Practice 4)
* Recognize individual contributions to the success of every effort. (for Practice 5)
* Celebrate team accomplishments regularly. (for Practice 5)
If you want to make a significant impact on people, on communities, and on organizations, you can do so by making the most important commitment: the commitment to become the very best leader you can be.

Let us go through these Ten Leadership Commitments this week and next week.
Search out challenging opportunities –
Leaders venture out. Those who lead others to greatness seek and accept challenge. Every single personal-best leadership case we collected involved some kind of challenge. Not one person said he or she achieved a personal best by keeping things the same.
The work of leaders is change, and the status quo is unacceptable to them. They search for opportunities to innovate, grow, and improve. But leaders need not always be the creators or originators. In fact, it’s just as likely that they’re not.
Sometimes a dramatic external event thrusts an organization into a radically new condition. Therefore, leaders must remain open to receiving ideas from anyone and anywhere. The leader’s primary contribution is in recognizing and supporting good ideas and in being willing to challenge the system to get new products, processes, services, and systems adopted.
Leaders are early supporters and adopters of innovation. Leaders know well that innovation and challenge involve experimentation, risk, and even failure. Experiments don’t always work out as planned. People often make mistakes when they try something new.
Instead of trying to fix blame for mistakes, leaders learn from them and encourage others to do the same. Leaders understand that the key that unlocks the door to opportunity is learning, especially in the face of obstacles. As weather shapes mountains, problems shape leaders. Leaders are learners.
Experiment, take risks, and learn from mistakes
In these highly competitive and fast-moving times pushing the boundaries — personal, team, and organization — is not an option, but a necessity. Leaders who want to achieve success understand that taking risk is an essential part of achieving results. Leaders must discover their ‘risk tolerance’ by stepping-out of the comfort zone and engage with these four things in mind:
* Do not let limited thinking stop you.
* Focus on the outcome and the rewards.
* Learn from mistakes.
Recognize that success and failure are connected and are necessary for growth.But, let’s be clear: Risk taking by itself without understanding the nuances of the challenge is reckless, and it will doom any project to failure. Finding the creative edges is both art and science. The best leaders have figured out how to do that. With that in mind, let me give you, a five-step process to help you as a leader as you step out of your comfort zone:
Step One: Listen to your intuition
First, there is no perfection in risk taking. It really is a gut reaction, an instinct if you will. Allow yourself the pleasure of following it. Quite often people overthink things; they come up with reasons “not to” and only end up coming back to their first thought anyway. Believe in that first thought. Listen carefully to it, and don’t be afraid to follow it — nine times out of ten, it will prove to be worth-while.
Step Two: Be careful of analysis paralysis
Great leaders don’t become great by being predictable and playing it safe. There is merit in being consistent, and all risks should have some level of consideration — but, don’t over-analyse. People can talk themselves out of anything and in risk taking you can’t let yourself get paralyzed in the details. It might never be the perfect time, with the perfect set of circumstances, but at some point, you just have to do it. Take the risk, make the move. People will respect you for it.
Step Three: Don’t let “What you think you know” guide all of your actions
We are all creatures of habit - to some extent - but also have minds like sponges. As professionals, we need to be open to learning, exploring and not believing that we have all of the answers. Because, let’s be honest, we never really do. It’s important to realize that the world is changing - and it’s changing quickly. Sometimes what worked before will never work again. The best thing we can do as a professional is be open to exploring the new options that come our way and implement a trial-and-error mentality.
Step Four: Try starting with baby steps
If risks aren’t for you, try them in small doses. Try a pilot or test before taking the big leap. This method will allow you to see the outcome before the impact is too grand.
Step Five: Be ready to make mistakes
You’ll find out that with risk taking you won’t win every time. Be sure to minimize the fallout whenever possible and plan to re-execute with necessary changes should a risk not pan out. They are called risks for a reason, but don’t be afraid to make a mistake. Mistakes are the best way people learn and develop into the best kind of professionals.
In summary, risks are all about encouraging your own development into the best person and professional you can be. If the word “risk” is too strong a word, try instead “thinking outside the box” or “being innovative.”
Envision an uplifting and enabling future.
Having foresight and considering the points mentioned will allow you to envision the future of your organization. By envisioning your future and communicating these plans to your team, you will be significantly ahead of most of your competitors. Keep in mind, a vision and strategic plan is not just a set of numbers. For example, a spreadsheet with sales and profit numbers is not a strategic plan.
You need a detailed plan on how you are going to get there. This should include goals, actions, due dates and responsibilities. You should also be sure that part of this future vision includes what skills or types of people you need your team to grow into. Then, get help from the outside to develop your human capital.
You also need to consider if the future will require any changes in your corporate culture. A culture is like a strong gravitational force - extremely hard to overcome. It will take work and often help from the outside. Any culture shift will require a charismatic and experienced team made up of both internal and external representatives. Don't minimize the challenge in changing cultures - most executives fail doing so. Even though what you are doing may be good for the company, possibly saving it, we are all human, and change is tough.
When we get stressed, most of us want to go back to the familiar. This will include your managers and your employees. Don't forget, people respond better when you tell them why and when they feel ownership.
Yes, planning for the future is challenging, but providing foresight is one of the most important aspects of what senior executives do for an organization. Ensure you are spending enough time to envision your company’s future and make it a continuous process. Foresight requires analytical and creative thinking, and it requires experience.
Although we cannot predict the future precisely, we can envision scenarios and plan for the future. Remember, failing to plan is planning to fail.
