AG says there is a possibility of arresting Prof. Samarasekara

The Attorney General yesterday informed the Colombo High Court there is a possibility of arresting former Colombo Chief Medical Officer Prof.Ananda Samarasekara over the alleged loss of body parts of rugby player Wasim Thajudeen.
Deputy Solicitor General Dilan Ratnayake appearing for the Attorney General made this observation when a revision application filed by Prof. Samarasekara was taken up before High Court Judge R. Gurusinghe.
Meanwhile, the inquiry into a revision application filed by former Colombo Chief Medical Officer Prof.Ananda Samarasekara challenging the Colombo Magistrate’s Court order to reject anticipatory bail for him over the alleged loss of body parts of rugby player Wasim Thajudeen was yesterday re-fixed for August 24 by Colombo High Court.
President’s Counsel Shavindra Fernando appearing for Prof. Samarasekara informed court that his client has undergone heart surgery.
In his revision application, Prof. Samarasekara had cited CID Homicide Investigations Unit OIC and the Attorney General as the respondents.
At a previous occasion, former Colombo chief JMO and Vice Chancellor of the South Asian Institute of Technology and Medicine (SAITM) Prof. Ananda Samarasekara had filed an anticipatory bail application in Court to pre-empt the possibility of his arrest on charges of a non-bailable offence relating to the alleged loss of body parts of Thajudeen.
On September 15, 2016 Colombo Additional Magistrate Dulani Amarasinghe refused to grant anticipatory bail on the former JMO, citing that the investigation pertaining to the loss of body parts of Thajudeen could be hampered if the petitioner was granted anticipatory bail.
However, through his revision application Prof. Samarasekara sought an order to revise Colombo Magistrate’s Court order to refuse him with anticipatory bail.
Prof.Samarasekara denied allegations leveled against him and maintained that he had not committed any offence.
President’s Counsel Shavindra Fernando with Counsel Iresh Seneviratne appeared for the former JMO.
Deputy Solicitor General Dilan Ratnayake appeared for the Attorney General.
