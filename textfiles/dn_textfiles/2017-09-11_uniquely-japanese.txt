Uniquely Japanese

There is a certain singularity when it comes to our two cultures: Sri Lanka and Japan. We have inevitably fallen in love with each other. What we have in common is this richness of culture. There is a certain distinctiveness and originality about our cultures. There is a certain element of wonder when it comes to our cultures. The Daily News visited the Japanese Cultural Exhibition 2017 celebrating the bicultural relations.
The value of learning Japanese in this day and age, has become invaluable. Japan and Sri Lanka have joined hands. Japan is becoming very involved with Sri Lanka.
“The Japanese cultural exhibition 2017 is under the support of the Embassy of Japan in association with the Japanese Language Teachers’ Association of Sri Lanka. Diplomatic ties between Sri Lanka and Japan have exceeded over 65 years. This annual event from the people of Japan and Sri Lanka is an opportunity to exchange love and respect. Our organisation is dedicated to teaching the Japanese Language to Sri Lankan students so that they can communicate with the Japanese people and come closer to each other,” said the Japanese Language Teachers’ Association President Anju Hewage.
The Japanese culture is extensive. It is a lifelong pursuit for academics. We all know that Japan has a culture which spans over hundreds of years through economic and technological changes. Its architecture, art, animation, music, literature, cuisine and philosophy are very diverse. According to many sources, the contemporary culture combines influences from Asia, Europe and North America. The Japanese philosophy has historically been a fusion of Chinese, the Western, and uniquely its own elements. The Japanese philosophy could be traced about fourteen centuries ago.
“We would also like to thank the members of the embassy of Japan and the participating cultural organizations for helping us to facilitate this event giving Sri Lankans the opportunity to learn more about Japan and Japanese culture,” said Hewage.
Japanese Ambassador Kenichi Suganuma stated that learning Japanese can open many doors. With Japan’s influence in Sri Lanka, the Japanese Language Teachers’ Association plays a commendable role.
“I would especially like to thank the Japanese Language Teachers’ Association because of their efforts. They have worked hard to find this venue and arrange this cultural exhibition for the pleasure of all visitors. I am sure that arranging the logistics would not have been very easy,” said Ambassador Suganuma.
The exhibition featured the uniqueness of Japanese Culture: Bonsai and Ikebana. The entire exhibition was no doubt fascinating to those who may not have been familiar with Japanese Culture. The Daily News was told that the intricacy of the Bonsai was a result of extreme patience and hard work. These Bonsai can last almost 100 years. It is a labor of great love and commitment.
“I would like to thank all the participating cultural organizations who have worked very hard, collaborating to make this exhibition a reality. This event is meant to introduce Japanese Culture to as many people as possible,” added Ambassador Suganuma.
The exhibits on display have been arranged by the Sri Lankan cultural organisations. That simply shows how the Japanese culture has been embraced and welcomed by Sri Lankans.
Ikebana, Bonsai and Origami have all expanded into so many countries. These arts are now world famous and were featured in a big way at the exhibition.
“This is a great joy and a matter of pride for us. It is a way that our ancestors are being honored. These arts are enriching. Relations between Japan and Sri Lanka have always been very good. And now it is being promoted further in many areas,” pointed out Ambassador Suganuma.
We can see many Japanese offices open up in Sri Lanka. Plus, they look for people who can speak Japanese. The prospects are becoming extremely lucrative in terms of business opportunities.
But the Japanese are not only into business. Many young people enjoy understanding and studying Japanese. Studying Japanese introduces people to a whole new world. Any Japanese visitor might find Sri Lanka a second home in conversation. It is good for pleasure and intellectual stimulation.
That momentum is now being put together.
