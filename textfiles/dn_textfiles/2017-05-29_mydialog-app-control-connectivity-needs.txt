MyDialog, an app  to control  connectivity needs

Have you ever wished that you could control all your connectivity needs through one app?
That you could check your phone bill, your internet bill, your rewards points, your mobile wallet, your television channels, news and a whole lot of other services in just one place?
That you could transfer funds and make appointments, all starting from one central location?
If you have, your wishes have just been granted—Dialog has launched a ‘master app’ called MyDialog hat helps you do just that.
Dialog offers a very large number of services to its customers, ranging from cellular, to mobile broadband, fixed broadband, television, and even the sale of hardware devices, just to name a few.
That is quite a lot to keep track of, especially if you have bought into the whole Dialog ecosystem and use a number of their services together.
Keeping an eye on your mobile bill, as well as your home broadband bill, television connection, EZ cash, and Star Points can involve switching between many different apps and services, signing in separately to each of them. This can take up a lot of time.
But the new MyDialog app brings all Dialog services together in one central application. Available on the Google Play Store, all you have to do is download the app, enter your phone number and a few basic details, and the app automatically brings together all the services you have registered for.
You can think of it as a master control room for all your Dialog needs.
The app lets you see everything you need at a single glance. It has no need for complicated interfaces.
The top of the screen will be populated by all your Dialog accounts. You will have your
phone number as well as the outstanding balance displayed.
Followed by any other mobile connections, home broadband connections, current outstanding balance and your remaining data allocation displayed in percentages.
If you have more than two accounts, you may swipe right to access the information pertaining to these accounts. Clicking on any account will allow you to see your bill details, such as the current outstanding amount and the date of your last payment.
Further on in the app, you will come across a list of the latest TV programmes currently being streamed through Dialog’s ViU mobile entertainment app.
Clicking on any of the programme thumbnails will take you straight to the ViU app where you can watch the programme on the go.
But that is not all—there are even more services listed. You can click on the eZ Cash icon, enter your pin, and view your balance, or you could see how many Star Points you have accumulated. You can even browse the Future Today magazine or set bill reminders on the calendar app so you won’t forget to pay your bill on time. You also access a newsfeed, or watch a curated playlist of videos. Through MyDialog, you can even channel doctors at leading private hospitals through the Doc 990 service. The possibilities are endless.
In addition, with this app you will be able to access a number of special deals on D-App such as
restaurant and hotel discounts, or shopping online via wow.lk. Check back with the app before
planning your next weekend getaway or shopping spree.
The MyDialog app makes it much easier to be in control of all your Dialog services, whether it be tracking usage, entertainment, managing your money, or rewarding yourself with special offers.
The app is easy to set up, quick to load, and pretty smooth to interact with. It is a great way to take control of all your connectivity and entertainment needs.
MyDialog is another first from the telco giant and represents a huge step forward in giving customers better control over their services.
