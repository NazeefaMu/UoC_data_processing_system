Eid-ul-Fitr Greetings

A month of goodwill and tolerance
“I am pleased to express my sincere greetings to all Muslims in Sri Lanka who had completed their fasting during the Holy month of Ramadan, while celebrating Eid ul Fithr with full satisfaction,” expressed Minister of Posts, Postal Services & Muslim Religious & Cultural Affairs M H A Haleem. In his message, the Minister further said that the fasting month was a great month for tolerance, while taking note of the sufferings of the underprivileged people. Muslims take this opportunity to spend the month with charity and prayers.
We have spent our time in prayers which would be answered, while our hearts are with the people who have suffered during the recent calamities and let Allah answer our prayers regarding them too. Patience is not only a part of the humanity of life, but also a month to demonstrate the necessity to succeed in mental satisfaction and determination. Lessons learnt during this period are necessary for every Muslim in our country to go forward not only with their community, but also satisfaction with all communities with love and tolerance. We need determination and changes in our thinking and lifestyle, such as relationships between communities for mutual unity and reconciliation. I would wish to express my greetings to all Muslims globally and not only to the Muslim people living in Sri Lanka.
