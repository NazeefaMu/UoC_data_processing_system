‘Unprecedented crowd expected at Kirulapona rally’

 
 Parliamentarian Prasanna Ranatunga yesterday said that an unprecedented crowd will participate in the May Day rally organised by the Joint Opposition in Kirulapona. He said the May Day should not be used for political purposes.
“It is a day in which the working masses demand their rights from the government,” he said. Ranatunga said they will support if an UPFA government is formed after May Day as announced by the UPFA General Secretary.
He was speaking at a press conference held at former President Mahinda Rajapaksa’s Office in Battaramulla yesterday
He said the government has curtailed facilities provided to the public service. The forces that brought this government into power are not happy with what the government is doing now, Ranatunga added.
He said doctors, farmers, police and and tri forces personnel are disappointed over the government’s activities. Ranatunga said the working masses’ masses can only be won through struggle.
