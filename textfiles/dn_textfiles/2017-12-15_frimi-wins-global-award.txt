FriMi wins Global Award

FriMi, the Digital Bank & Lifestyle Partner powered by Nations Trust Bank has won the award for Emerging Technologies Led Innovation at the recently concluded Infosys Client Innovation Awards, which was held in Mysore, India.
FriMi is the first digital bank in Sri Lanka and allows new users to open interest earning accounts directly from their smartphones, with no visit to a bank. It is also a digital payments and marketing platform, allowing users to pay for products and services at merchants and receive special offers.
Finacle is a Core Banking Product developed by Infosys Limited of India and serves diverse clients all over the world. The Infosys Client Innovation Awards, now in its fourth year running, seeks to recognize and celebrate the most innovative uses of the FinacleCore Banking solution by clients across eight categories.
Tilak Piyadigama and Nisala Kodippili the COO and CIO of Nations Trust Bank, respectively and two of the key personalities behind the development of FriMi said they were thrilled and feel a real sense of accomplishment for the bank.
‘Winning this global award from InfoSys is a significant achievement because they are known amongst senior banking circles for their attention to detail and high standards. To have won means that we really impressed the selection panels and came out ahead of the competition, which is something we strive for.’
The Infosys Finacle Client Innovation Awards is a massive event involving 350 participants from all over the world.
Speaking about Nations Trust Bank’s view on the future of digital banking they added, ‘The future of banking is digital, that much is clear. Therefore, the potential for expansion and innovation in this space is virtually limitless and we are working to capitalize on that. We see regulators now taking a keen interest and even the government working to provide the legal framework necessary, through legislation, to promote the digitalization of banking and financial services. So our view on the future of digital banking is that it is bright and one in which we are working to shine bright in.’
In response to being asked why Nations Trust Bank chose to pioneer in this field and launch Sri Lanka’s First Digital Bank, FriMi they said, ‘Nations Trust Bank has always been a pioneer in many things. We pioneered 365 day banking, extended banking and other things which have been widely adopted.”
‘This journey has not been without challenges, in fact we’ve faced them right along. The most significant one was how to fulfil the KYC (Know Your Customer) requirements of the regulator.
Discussing FriMi’s vision for the future and what was immediately next on the cards they said, ‘We want FriMi to be a household name when you talk about financial and lifestyle services and cashless and cardless transactions. Basically we want FriMi to be your lifestyle partner, a one-stop shop for banking andfinancial services and build an eco-system around it.
Soon we will also have full support for all three languages to aid this process. We are planning of taking FriMi internationally and this global scalability means that our growth potential is astronomical.
