EU funds Rs 29 mn to help flood, lanslide victims

Following the devastating floods and landslides which have struck Sri Lanka over the last weeks, the European Commission gave €160,000 (around Rs 29 million) in humanitarian funding to bring emergency assistance to the communities affected by the recent floods.
Some 17,500 people in the seven most affected districts of the country will benefit from the aid. Priority will be given to those who have been displaced. This EU funding supports the Sri Lanka Red Cross Society in delivering relief assistance to those families who are currently living in temporary shelters or evacuation centres.They will receive cash grants which will enable them to purchase essential household items.Priority will be given to access to clean water and sanitation, particularly through the cleaning of wells with contaminated water. First aid and medical services will also be provided, together with hygiene awareness sessions to avoid the spread of waterborne diseases.
The funding is part of the EU’s overall contribution to the Disaster Relief Emergency Fund (DREF) of the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC).
Since May 19, the southwest monsoon weather conditions have caused heavy rainfalls in the southwest parts, triggering floods and landslides in various locations. According to information released by the national Disaster Management Center, close to 175,000 people have been affected across 19 districts, and 26 people killed. Puttalam, Gampaha, Ratnapura, Colombo, Kurunegala, Kalutara and Kegalle are among the worst affected districts.
