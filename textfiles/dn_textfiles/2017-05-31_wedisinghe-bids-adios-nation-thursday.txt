Wedisinghe bids adios to nation on Thursday

One of Sri Lanka’s finest racing riders, Ananda Wedisinghe’s demise came as a shock to the local motor sports fraternity and is considered as an irreparable loss for motor sports.
Wedisinghe who had an illustrious racing career died on May 29 at the age of 47 following a tragic crash at the Group SM 450cc class event of 2017 Nuwara Eliya Road Races.
The riding ace was on life support for nearly a month at the Kandy General Hospital ICU before he breathed his last on Monday.
Wedisinghe is an old boy of St. Anne’s College, Kurunegala and stepped into Motorbike Racing by competing in Nuwara Eliya Motocross, 25 years ago.
Since then he has won many accolades and stamped his class by winning the prestigious Fox Hill Supercross Best Rider title eight times.
He was a friend to all and a true gentleman. Wedisinghe’s funeral will take place on Thursday (June 1), at 4.30pm at the Malkaduwawa cemetery, Kurunegala.
