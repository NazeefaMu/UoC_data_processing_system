My security axed seeing massive crowd at JO May Day rally: MR

“The government got terribly upset over the massive turnout of people at the Galle Face Joint Opposition May Day rally and withdrew 47 officers from my security detail, Kurunegala District Parliamentarian and Former President Mahinda Rajapaksa said.
No one will be able to halt my march with the people even if my security detail is withdrawn in its entirety,” he said.
He was addressing a meeting after unveiling the pinnacle of a new chaitiya at the Welgala Sri Moroththarama Viharaya in the Hiriyala electorate on Saturday.
Mahinda Rajapaksa said people had become helpless and engage in a struggle to survive. The government was fleecing the public by introducing new taxes.
“All democratic rights had been usurped and elections were being constantly postponed, he said.
“Our next struggle will be to push the government to hold elections. No country had been able to scuttle people’s struggles for liberty.” he said.
Rajapaksa said people should rally round to defeat the governing robbers and protect national assets.
They must rally round to steer the country towards unity and harmony by defeating separatism and betrayal of war heroes.
Viharadhipati Ven Hataraliyaddde Narada Nayake Thera, Parliamentarians Salinda Dissanayake and Johnston Fernando and artiste Bandula Wijeweera spoke at the meeting.
