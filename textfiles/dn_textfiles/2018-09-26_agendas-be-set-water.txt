IWA Congress in Sri Lanka next year:
Agendas to be set on water

The objectives of the International Water Association (IWA) Congress and Exhibition to be held in Colombo next year is to set agendas on water and sustainable development, and to form a platform to enhance sector policies, good practices and appropriate technologies to manage water related issues, Urban Development and Water Supply State Minister Lucky Jayawardena said.
He was addressing the IWA World Congress – 2018 held in Tokyo, Japan, recently.
“The National Water Supply and Drainage Board (NWSDB) conducts a research and development symposium every year along with the World Water Day events in March.
“As we are now planning the IWA Congress and an exhibition in August next year, we will hold the research and development symposium of NWSDB as a side event of the Congress,” he said.
The minister said: “with this we are planning to enhance the quality and standard of our research and development symposium.
It will also give an opportunity for NWSDB professionals to expand their horizons by taking part in the symposium which will be a part of the IWA conference.”
The conference will also include an industrial exhibition with over 100 stalls for local industries and partners to promote their business with local and foreign participants to help the local industry to secure more business.
The IWA Congress and exhibition will be organised in collaboration with the City Planning and Water Supply Ministry.
The conference will give an opportunity to showcase the work being undertaken in Sri Lanka in water and wastewater fields. Furthermore, the conference would attract high-level representatives from the water sector, funding institutions, regulators, operators and specialized companies involved in the sector, the State Minister said.
“By providing learning and international networking opportunities, the IWA Congress would benefit the professional development of Sri Lankan water and environmental professionals, engineers, chemists, regulators, and policymakers,” he said.
It will provide Sri Lankan institutions an opportunity to negotiate with international partners, and could create potential business opportunities. The event will also provide exposure to young professionals, as well as training, he added. “The most contemporary challenge faced by us is the water resources constraints and integrated water management challenges. We have adapted the desalination option and developed dedicated storage reservoirs for drinking water purposes. In this context, we suggest that the theme of next year’s IWA conference in Sri Lanka should be in line with water resource allocation, sharing, reservation and integrated management,” the State Minister said.
