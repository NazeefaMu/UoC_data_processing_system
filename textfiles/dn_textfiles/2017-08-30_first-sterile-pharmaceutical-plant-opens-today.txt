First sterile pharmaceutical plant opens today

Navesta Pharmaceuticals Private Ltd will open Sri Lanka’s first ever sterile pharmaceutical manufacturing plant in Horana today.
In September 2015, Navesta Pharmaceuticals headed by its Chairman, Sanjaya Jayaratne, officially acquired Board of Investments (BOI) Corporation standards to set up a project to manufacture pharmaceutical products for the local market. President Maithripala Sirisena and Minister of Health Dr. Rajitha Senaratne will open the factory today at 3 30 p.m.
