Tangalle Public play ground in ruins

The public playground at Tangalle is on the verge of destruction due to lack of renovations and non-maintenance.It was declared open by the former President Mahinda Rajapaksa in 2001 when he was the Minister of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources Development.
A part of the playground remains overgrown with shrub jungle.The area where the sports lovers have to sit and witness matches and other events is also dilapidated to a large extent.
The spectators get wet when it rains because the roofing sheets in certain areas of the roof remain broken. The playground is haunted by crows and doves and doves nets are seen all over the roof of the playground.
