‘Era of political influence for jobs over’

Finance and Mass Media Minister Mangala Samaraweera says the present government has ended the era when the country’s youth had to seek political influence for employment.
The Minister, speaking at a ceremony to hand over appointment letters to a newly-recruited batch of Customs officers last Friday, said the government has introduced an impartial programme to provide jobs solely based on qualifications.
“Sri Lanka Customs is the main income source of the country. The Customs, Excise, and Inland Revenue Departments are the three main revenue generators for the government,” the Minister said.
“Free education from Grade One to university level and also free health services are provided by utilising this income.”
“Therefore, today you are joining a field which is economically very important for the government.”
He also told the 77 new officers that they had been selected out of 7,400 applicants following a very competitive exam and interview process. Treasury Secretary R.H.S. Samaratunga and Customs Director General P.S.M. Charles were also present on the occasion.
