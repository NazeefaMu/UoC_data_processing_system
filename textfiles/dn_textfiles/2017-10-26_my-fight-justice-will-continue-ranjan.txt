My fight for justice will continue - Ranjan

Deputy Minister Ranjan Ramanayake yesterday stressed that his endeavour is to create a clean judiciary and ensure justice for all.
Speaking to the media after appearing before the Supreme Court over the contempt of court case, when it was taken up yesterday, the Deputy Minister said he will continue his struggle to condemn judges and lawyers who protect rogues, drug barons and thugs.
The case is to be taken again on November 21.
“I was not summoned to appear before the court today, but I voluntarily came as I am not a coward.
The rich who had committed grave offences get off the hook by taking legal aid from the highest paid President’s Counsels, while the poor who commit minor offences such as stealing three mangoes get convicted. The ordinary people cannot afford to take the legal assistance of those lawyers,” he commented.
“Law should not be practiced with a money oriented mind. My crusade was to expose the corrupt judges such as Sarath N Silva, Mohan Peiris, Lenin Rathnayake and Sarath de Abrew. We need to save people from the mafia in the court. Do not try to intimidate us. There is freedom of speech in this country. Nobody should be above the law may they be war heroes, politicians or religious leaders,” he added.
