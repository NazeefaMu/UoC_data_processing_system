COMBANK announces special ‘Leasing Vaaré’

The Commercial Bank of Ceylon has declared September to November ‘leasing season’ and will help customers celebrate by offering extra special interest rates during these three months.
Designated ‘Leasing Vaaré’ these three months will see a series of branch level activities and campaigns as well as joint promotions with reputed vendors. This is the second such seasonal leasing promotion conducted by the Bank.
The Bank said a monthly rental of just Rs 2,034/- per Rs 100,000 would be available on a five-year Super Lease, where the customer pays lower monthly rentals and makes a lump sum payment at the end of the lease.
On standard leasing, the Bank will offer a monthly rental on a five-year lease, also lower than prevailing rates in the market.
These special rates will be available on leases entered into before 30th November 2017, the Bank said.
Commercial Bank has already commenced a joint promotion with DIMO for the full range of Tata commercial vehicles sold by the latter in Sri Lanka.

The Bank won 10 major international awards in 2016 and has over the years won multiple awards as Sri Lanka’s Best Bank, Best Trade Bank, Strongest Bank and Most Respected Bank from a number of local and international institutions and publications.
It has also been adjudged one of Sri Lanka’s 10 best corporate citizens by the Ceylon Chamber of Commerce for several years.
