Amana Takaful introduces novel products to industry

 
Amana Takaful revolutionised the insurance industry with the introduction of ‘Takaful’ Insurance, which shifted the focus of ‘benefits’ from the company to the customer and has introduced several other new features to their product.
These products have helped Amana Takaful to make a considerable impact on the industry.
Within the principles of Takaful (Mutuality), Amana Takaful has offered a range of solutions to their customers, fulfilling the entire gamut of insurance needs, from ‘Motor’ (Total Drive), ‘Business’ (Business Cover), ‘Travel’ (Travel Pal), ‘Education’ (Adhyapana) and even an exclusive solution for ‘Ladies’ (Crystalline), to name a few.
Living up to their standard of Mutuality and reaffirming their attitude of Equality (‘Open to All’), Amana Takaful has revamped and relaunched their solutions for Motor Bikes (Smart Rider Cover) and Three Wheelers (Tuk Tuk Full) under the theme ‘The Revolution on Wheels’, providing unprecedented benefits and considerable relief to Motorcycle Riders and Three Wheel Drivers.
“We are pleased to fulfil our promise to our customers, by offering comprehensive solutions which provide significant relief to every single citizen of this country, from any accident or mishap that may occur on the road. These policies are intended to function as a ‘safety net’ in case of tragedy, for Motorcycle Riders and Threewheel Drivers, an objective we are faithfully committed to, as a Protection and Indemnity Solutions Provider in Sri Lanka”, said Fazal Gaffoor, CEO of Amana Takaful.
