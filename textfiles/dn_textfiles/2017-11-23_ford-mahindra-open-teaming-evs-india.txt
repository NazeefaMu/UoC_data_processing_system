Ford, Mahindra open to teaming up on EVs in India

Ford Motor Co. and its Indian partner Mahindra and Mahindra Ltd. could create their own electric car line in India to help battle pollution from the vehicles clogging the nation's roads, Chairman Anand Mahindra said.
Mahindra & Mahindra, which already sells the e2o micro electric car, would be open to creating a new electric vehicle line in India with Ford, Mahindra said following the opening of a factory in suburban Detroit to produce an off-road vehicle for the U.S. market. Ford said earlier this month it will create a new electric car line in China with its partner there, Anhui Zotye Automobile Co.
“India could be the other location for doing that,” Mahindra said Monday when asked if Ford's plan to create an EV lineup with its Chinese partner could be replicated in India. “In India, it may just happen because of a crisis of congestion and pollution, which is why the government there said we want every car to be electric by 2030, which is outrageously ambitious.”
Ford and Mahindra rekindled a partnership in September to work together on electric cars, connected vehicles and distribution in India, where the U.S. automaker struggles to make money. India is set to become the world's third-largest auto market and both companies have strengths in light trucks. As part of a three-year alliance, the two automakers are looking for ways to cut costs and boost profits by jointly purchasing parts and developing new models
