MR’s outstanding dues to SriLankan Airlines to be forwarded to COPE

A report will be forwarded to COPE on payments due to SriLankan Airlines by former President Mahinda Rajapaksa, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said.
“The COPE Committee will then decide on the further measures that should be taken in this regard,” Premier Wickremesinghe said.
The Prime Minister was replying to a question posed by UNP MP S. M. Marrikkar whether the government is planning to recover the money owed by the ex-President for his air travels, which allegedly amounts to eleven hundred thousand rupees.
PM Wickremesinghe said the government should first settle the payments due. “Only then we can forward a report in this regard to the COPE committee.The real problem is that the ex-president has not just booked tickets for his travels.
He has just gone an reserved whole planes for his travels,” Premier Wickremesinghe said.
MP S.M.Marrikkar also questioned PM Wickremesinghe on the steps taken by the government to expedite the rural development activities.
“The government has implemented 28,649 projects concerning rural development within the year 2016.We have allocated Rs. 708 billion for this year for rural development and infrastructure facilities,” the Prime Minister said.
The Premier pointed out,even though the present government is not holding media displays on its development projects,a number of initiatives has been taken regarding rural development.
“The government is to start the ‘Swashakthi’ program together with the Central Bank and 17 more merchant banks, as an important step in rural development.” the PM Wickremesighe noted.
He also said, the government is requesting the regional banks to allocate a certain amount of money to provide loan facilities to their regional small scale traders at village levels.
MP Marrikkar also pointed out to the Prime Minister that the government is not doing a proper awareness campaign targeting the public, on the programs carried out by it.
