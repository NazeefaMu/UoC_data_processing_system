‘New Constitution will fulfill people’s mandate’

It is the responsibility of the government to fulfil the people’s mandate and even the Mahanayake Theras are a part of it, Cabinet Spokesperson and Health and Indigenous Medicine Minister Dr.Rajitha Senarathne said.
He made this observation yesterday at the cabinet press conference when asked about the Maha Sangha led by the Mahanayake Theras of three Nikayas’ decision that there is no need to bring in a new Constitution as it will create more conflicts in the country.
“The final decision has to be made by Parliament. Six committees have been appointed in which some secretaries are from the Opposition.The Parliament now sits in as a Constitution Assembly like in 1972. The reports formulated by these six committees will be submitted to Parliament. If it is passed by a two thirds majority and if the Supreme Court orders to go for a referendum, people can come up with their opinions”, he said.
Minister Senaratne said that before objecting to the drafting of the new constitution, they should understand the real objectives and questioned for how long the country can run without a new constitution. “We are formulating the new constitution to implement it and not just to keep watching. People can express their views and opinions when it is completed. We cannot come to a final decision based on opinions forwarded by some organisations. It has been clearly stated that the new constitution would be implemented only if the Sinhala majority agrees to it”, he said. Minister Senaratne pointed out that even in the past important decisions like making the Tamil language one of the national languages and devolving the power were opposed initially but later they were introduced.
Sports Minister Dayasiri Jayasekara said still the final draft of the constitution has not been made and it is being discussed.
“Many have expressed their opinions individually as well as a party. Some agree to the proposals made at the committee meeting but will go out and object it”, he said. He said the people need to understand the real objectives behind the need for a new constitution for the betterment of the country.
