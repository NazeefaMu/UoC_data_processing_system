India miss Champions Trophy squad submission deadline

India have missed the April 25 deadline to submit their Champions Trophy squad to the ICC and it is understood the BCCI told the ICC that it could not submit the squad for "operational" reasons.
The other seven countries have all announced their squads.
According to a BCCI official, the delay was inevitable. With the BCCI secretary Amitabh Choudhury and CEO Rahul Johri attending the ICC meetings this week, and captain Virat Kohli playing the IPL, all concerned parties couldn't be in one place at the same time to pick the squad.
"We have told the ICC the reason behind the delay," the official said. "We have told them we will announce it soon."
However, the delay is being seen as a message from the BCCI to the ICC that it can still withdraw from the Champions Trophy should its demand to retain its share of revenue not be met. The ICC had earlier initiated reforms to undo the big-three revenue model, which could have brought the BCCI's share down from $570 million to $290 million.
