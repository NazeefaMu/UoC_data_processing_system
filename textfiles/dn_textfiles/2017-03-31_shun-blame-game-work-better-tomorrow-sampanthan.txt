Shun blame game, work for better tomorrow: Sampanthan

Sri Lanka has a peaceful environment devoid of war. The time has come for the people to buckle down to work to develop the country without engaging in blame games for the war which is a thing of the past, Opposition Leader R. Sampanthan said.
The Opposition Leader expressed these sentiments when he inaugurated the 8th National Youth camp ‘Yovun Pura’ at Trincomalee on Wednesday.
He said the contribution of the youth generation is vital to achieve development objectives. Sampanthan said educational and technological development has become the need of the hour as they create jobs. Since youth are the future leaders of the country, they should be led on the proper path. At a time when people of three main communities belonging to four religions live in peace and harmony, all should march together to build a new Sri Lanka, he said.
The Opposition Leader said when Sri Lanka attained independence in 1948, the country was so developed that Singapore's Prime Minister at the time said Singapore too should follow Sri Lanka's example in development. But today Singapore has overtaken Sri Lanka in the sphere of development leaving us far behind, he said. National Policy and Economic Affairs State Minister Niroshan Perera said youth had assembled at the ‘Yovun Puraya’ to shoulder the responsibility of creating a country where all could live in friendship, amity and brotherhood. Those participating in the camp should take the message to their villages to muster their brethren at village level to the task of building the country and giving them the leadership.
National Youth Services Council (NYSC) Chairman and Director General Erandika Weliange said Sri Lanka remained a third world country as certain past leaders did not place confidence in youth. He said Rs. 120 million was distributed among youth attending the ‘Yovun Pura’ under the ‘Gamata Kotiyak’ programme.
Eastern Province Chief Minister Hafeez Nazeer Ahmed also spoke.
Eastern Province Governor Austin Fernando, Provincial Ministers, A L Mohamed Nazeer and Ariyawatie Galappeththy and Trincomalee District Secretary N. A. A. Pushpakumara were also present. The Yovun Pura attended by 6,000 youths and 110 foreign youth delegates will conclude on April 2.
