PTL CEO hands over his mobile phone to investigators

PTL CEO Kasun Palisena handed over his mobile phone to the forensic investigators attached to the Treasury Bond Commission yesterday.
However, Perpetual Capital Holdings' attorney Kalinga Indatissa questioned the Attorney General’s directive to PTL CEO Kasun Palisena to hand over all his digital communication devices, at the Treasury Bond Commission yesterday.
PTL CEO Kasun Palisena will testify before the Treasury Bond Commission on August 8, 2017.
Indatissa PC said the Presidential Commission of Inquiry Act does not provide the Attorney General such powers.
Indatissa also requested a ruling from the Treasury Bond Commission to treat Palisena’s mobile phone the same way the PCoI has treated former Governor Arjun Mahendran’s phone after surrendering to the CID led forensic examination.
