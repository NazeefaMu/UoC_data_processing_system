ACC Emerging Team Cup 2018 cricket tournament:
Lanka play Oman in opening match today

Former U-19 skipper Charith Asalanka will lead Sri Lanka’s strong Emerging Squad at the ACC Emerging Team Cup 2018 cricket tournament in the first match against Oman at the R.Premadasa Stadium today.
Group A of this tournament comprises India U23, Sri Lanka U23, Afghanistan U23 and Oman. All Groups A fixtures are scheduled to take place in Sri Lanka.
The Sri Lanka U23 has a few players who have the experience of playing international cricket in the likes of Kamindu Mendis, Sandun Weerakkody, Jeffrey Vandersay and Asela Gunaratne, who returns to competitive cricket after injury.
Oman has had a successful run this year. They finished the ICC World Cricket League Division 3 with a 100% record. However, they will have their task cut out against the hosts who go into the clash as favourites.
Teams:
Sri Lanka U23: Charith Asalanka (c), Shammu Ashan, Sandun Weerakkody (wk), Kamindu Mendis, Asela Gunaratne, Nishan Madushka, Jeffrey Vandersay, Lasith Ambuldeniya, Nishan Peiris, Shehan Madushanka, Asitha Fernando
