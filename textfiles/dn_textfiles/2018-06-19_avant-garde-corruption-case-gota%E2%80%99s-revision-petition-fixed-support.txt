Avant-Garde corruption case: Gota’s revision petition fixed for support

 
A revision application filed by Former Defence Secretary Gotabhaya Rajapaksa seeking an order to stay the Colombo Chief Magistrate’s Court proceedings pertaining to Avant-Garde corruption case was fixed for support on July 2 by Court of Appeal today.Through this petition, Gotabaya Rajapaksa also challenged Colombo Chief Magistrate's decision to refuse preliminary objections raised by him regarding the Avant-Garde corruption case. The Bribery Commission filed a corruption case against former Defence Secretary Gotabhaya Rajapaksa and seven others for allegedly causing a Rs.11.4 billion unlawful loss to the government by giving permission to Avant-Garde Maritime Services (Pvt) Ltd to operate a floating armory. 
In his revision petition, Gotabaya Rajapaksa challenged Chief Magistrate's decision to refuse preliminary objections raised by him and Chief Magistrate's decision to fix the matter for trial.
