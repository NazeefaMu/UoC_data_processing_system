Making peace with  problems

The world is full frailties and Head Boy of Gateway Yeran Karunanayake knows that compassion can make the difference. Yet he also understands that compassion itself will not create positive change unless proper leadership is given. Perfect Prefects features Karunanayake who feels the need to get organized and get a team together.
The first step towards getting organized is diplomacy. You can’t show attitude to people and get things done. You need to get them on to your side. You need to have a winning personality and for that, you need to work on your personality.
Simple accomplishments
“One thing I have learnt in my tenure as Head Boy of Gateway is the importance of being diplomatic. In other words, you need to be a people person. Because different people behave in different ways and something you might say or do to some person, might rub another person in the wrong direction. Understanding how people tick and how to get someone on to your side is part of being a leader. As a head prefect, you don’t need to be haughty or arrogant. You’ll be amazed at what can be accomplished simply by being nice to people.
If you see something wrong you should be able to tackle it in a diplomatic way by being tactful, so your relationship with the person will not be tarnished. Bossing them around can actually work against you. That and leading by example are two of the most important characteristics when becoming a leader,” said Karunanayake.
When encountering a problem you need the proper mentality. You need to think the right way. You need the correct attitude.
“When you have a problem you shouldn’t get stressed out. You need to understand that there is always a solution to every problem. If you tackle a problem with that mentality you are sure to come up with a solution. If you worry, fret and think too much about the issue then it will work against you. So you should have a positive and optimistic attitude. Then you should also be determined. If there is a problem you need to tackle it head-on. You cannot shy away from it, you need to meet it head-on,” stated Karunanayake.
Ideology of hope
Karunanayake has with him the team – his Prefect Guild. They are a group of young people who believe in action.
“When dealing with issues in life you need to be positive and optimistic, and one thing about our Prefects Guild is, we believe we can bring about positive change. This is not only in our school but outside. We do a lot of projects like a flood donation campaign. We try and install solar panels in houses that do not have electricity. So we try and come up with a collective solution. That itself promotes the ideology of there being hope. So definitely I feel hope is greater and stronger than fear,” pointed out Karunanayake.
Karunanayake believes in speaking his mind. He is straightforward and does not fear the consequences. He is spontaneous and bold.
“Being courageous also involves having an optimistic attitude. You need to tackle every problem head-on. You don’t shy away from anything and you do not shy away from anyone. If there is someone you have to talk against, you have to do it, and you have to speak your mind at that moment without thinking about it. Because I feel that one mistake we make, is we do not speak our minds at that moment, so we shy away from facing the consequences. Being courageous is calling stuff as we see it,” explained Karunanayake.
Working with people
Being intelligent is also being diplomatic says Karunanayake. He knows that each situation varies in its own context. Knowing how to handle each situation is being intelligent. Being intelligent is not only being good in your studies, it is understanding how life works, how the world works and how people work.
“I am studying Math, Physics and Economics. But I am more towards the field of physics so I will probably take up environmental engineering. These goals are there because again I want to bring a positive change in this world. I am very serious about trying to bring a positive change in this world. I feel that this is my calling. I want to be a humanitarian and the projects I mentioned before done by myself and my Prefect’s Guild are also humanitarian projects,” shared Karunanayake.
Thinking about others is a value that Karunanayake prizes. This is vital for positive change.
“I speak very genuinely when I say that I want to help other people. Some time ago, I thought that one person cannot change this world, purely because the attitudes of people today are very self-centred. But over the years my ideas changed and I became more positive and optimistic and more defiant. Now I believe that one person can make a change, you just need to surround yourself with the right people. No one can bring change on their own, there will always be people who will want to support you. You are not alone in this world at all when trying to make a positive change. We tend to look away from those who are suffering. Some people actually need help even though there are some fakes,” emphasizes Karunanayake
Global Warming, Sexual Abuse, Domestic Abuse and Animal Abuse affect him. An animal lover he feels for animals as well. It is no secret that there has been a flood of emails from animal organizations highlighting the terrible abuses and cruelties of animals.
“There is so much of animal abuse in this world. I have seen graphic images of pets being abused. I have seen dogs beaten up and it goes on and on. Why would they have pets if they are doing this? There is definitely a lack of compassion in this world when it comes to animals,” said Karunanayake.
Plight and despair
One only needs to travel by bus in Colombo to hear the sad tales recounted by people who get into the buses. They speak of their plight and despair, tales about their nightmarish lives.
“Some parents try to shield their kids from the harsh realities of life outside. So they live in their little bubble, and they don’t know what is actually happening. International school children rarely go on the bus. Some of them do not understand what goes around. They do not open their eyes. Unless it happens to you, you will not understand. When it happens to you then you will have that compassion,” said Karunanayake
Karunanayake pointed out that the education system at Gateway is incredible. They follow the British Curriculum which he sees as a plus point. The education and the understanding is great. And their teachers make a big difference. Karunanayake’s hero is his father and he feels that one reason the youth go wrong is because they surround themselves with the wrong people.
He has been part of the Model United Nations and was the Finance Director for the Interact Club, as well as being the President of the History Society. He has done a little bit of Athletics and is the Vice Captain of the Basket Ball team.
“My family and my school have been very supportive of me. They have encouraged me to become a more balanced person excelling academically and also in extra-curricular activities. The values and ideologies I possess have been inculcated in me by my family. When I thanked them at the speech I made as Head Prefect, that was a very emotional moment for me. They mean the whole world to me because of everything that they have done for me,” summed up Karunanayake.
