Big in talent!

The Girls of Hillwood College Kandy are some of the most accomplished Thespians when it comes to school drama. Dramatic Moves features Hillwood College, Kandy where confidence and charisma are generated under one roof and then successfully enacted on stage.
Teacher in charge of Drama Thilini Wijeratne feels that it is really this charisma the girls have developed that helps them.
Passion for drama
“Drama society of Hillwood College Kandy is one of the oldest societies in school. I too was a member of it when I was a student of HCK. However, I was made the teacher in charge from 2010 onwards,” said Wijeratne.
Throughout the years Hillwood has maintained an excellent track record and have a reputation for top quality plays.
“We got selected to perform at the final round many times at Shakespeare Drama Competitions organized by Colombo Rotary club and have won the Best Outstation Production award many times and the Best Outstation Actress and Supporting Actress awards. Last year, at the Kandy Shakespeare festival, we won the Best Girls’ production award and Keshala Perera was adjudged the Best Actress. Apart from that, we have won zonal and provincial level in drama organized by the Ministry of Education,” said Wijeratne.
The girls are definitely passionate about drama and enjoy it thoroughly.
“Our main strength is the passion for drama. Girls love taking part in Shakespeare dramas and they are thrilled to do musicals. They acquire a lot through drama, especially self-confidence, they get rid of stage-fright and develop understanding and respect for another person. Stage acting makes a person very charismatic and at the same time makes her sensitive towards others’ emotions,” explained Wijeratne.
Talent is there from the nursery to Advance Level. They take part in performances at an early age of five until they become eighteen. So HCK is big in talent.
“They become charismatic and socialized individuals. They have a better understanding and broader approach towards issues in life. They have explored and seen the world before others in their own class. They do not stick only to the school syllabus. We have worked with experts like late professor Ashley Halpe and Bridget Halpe when it comes to Shakespeare and Lakshmi Wickramaratne and Radhika Jayathilake for musicals. So, their readings of the texts are of a very high level and their expertises are immensely valuable for the students. Simply this is the springboard for young talent to come out or identified,” elucidated Wijeratne.
Working with the girls is a special experience.
“I think I am lucky to work with young, energetic students like them as I learn a lot from them. They are more modern and technical. So my theories are better practiced with their technical competency. Irangani Serasinghe is my personal favorite on stage and in screen. I like to see at least one or two girls from HCK to come up to that level so HCK Drama Society can be proud of creating the platform for young actresses who are culturally rich to emerge,” shared Wijeratne.
Humorous acts
Vice President Saadia Jameel, chose the correct word – ‘Unleash’ “Last year the drama that we performed on our English Day we took it to the Zonal level and we were placed third. The talents of the committee members are definitely strength to us. One of the skills we have acquired is stage presence, clarity and audibility, everything a thespian and an individual should possess. We had one girl in Grade 11 who was scared to talk out loud, but then when she started acting, she overcame that inhibition,” said Jameel. Drama starts at a very young age at Hillwood.
“Our Primary Drama Circle is going for the all island competition next week. They won zonal and provincial and they are going to the all island,” stated Jameel.
Unlike in speeches where you need to know grammar, drama is nothing like that because you can memorize a script and you just come forward and show your skills and presence and you get the opportunity to unleash yourselves.
“Playing a boy’s role is not difficult for me because I always end up playing boys roles. I feel more confident playing boys’ roles than girls’ roles. Humorous acts are really famous in our school as well as Shakespeare. Over the years the numbers of students taking part in drama has really increased. And now it is going strong and it is fun. Practices are in the night after all the other activities are over. We come in at around 7pm and we finish practices by 9pm,” pointed out Jameel.
Manageable
Secretary Purni Godahenage, feels that drama puts you at ease with anyone you meet and gives you the ability to go up and talk to anyone.
“All our girls are very talented. Drama helps you speak freely to people openly. Drama can instill confidence in a person by speaking and standing in front of a crowd and reciting your lines. I think playing a boys role largely depends on the movements that you make. It is a little different than the girls. It is a little hard but it is manageable,” said Godahena.
Hidden talents

Committee Member, Lasni Rajapaksha, voiced a similar opinion
“What I have received from drama are the speaking skills and ability to face a big crowd and talking to people without fear. I feel drama can bring out your hidden talents,” said Rajapaksha.
Tomboyish
Committee Member, Minna Azmy said she definitely enjoys doing drama.
“One memorable play we have done is ‘Anne Arky’ by Lindsay Price and it was one of the best plays we have done. That drama was so good. It was a parody of Anne of Green Gables. Drama is the best way to develop self -confidence. It helps us get rid of stage fear. It gives us the opportunity to improve language. It is something that we enjoy doing. In addition to our studies it is a good extra-curricular activity to have.
Maybe because I am tomboyish, I prefer acting as a boy, it is easier for me to get into a role as a boy,” said Azmy.
Make a small twist
Committee member Salomi Navamani, said drama is all about old friends.
“Even on school basis and even when we go out and we are asked to act, we can do it because we have developed that skill in school. More importantly it gives confidence. All of us bond really well. We have been together from Grade 6 doing dramas. The chemistry from that young age has been developing up to date. It is so good to get to work with them. The younger girls have the potential and the capability to take drama forwards when we leave. They are very responsible. The inter-house competition held the year before from last year was really competitive. It benefited the actresses,” said Navamani.
Navamani feels that when stepping into the skin of a character it is mainly research and the expert guidance of the teachers.
If you are someone who is scared to present yourself, it is a good start for you. Everything is prepared all you have to do is make a small twist on your side, perform and just enjoy yourself and stick to the fact that you have to entertain the audience,” said Navamani.
The girls all unanimously agreed that drama will thrive at Hillwood College in the future because of the dedication from the students and the teachers. The girls they say are very enthusiastic. As Godahenage said the talent at Hillwood is really big!
At inter-house level they need to make their own scripts and are given a prize for the best script. It is not only for the acting. They give points for the script, dedication and the acting. The girls are all from different streams (Arts, Math, Science and Commerce) but they come together when doing drama. They are now good friends having met through drama.
Daily News also spoke to the Intermediate level dramatists at Hillwood College Kandy.
Definitely interested
For Dhamindi Senarathne the field of drama is nothing new to her.
“I do English Literature so it helps me to get to know more about the subject. You get a lot of new experiences doing drama. I want to get into the drama field because I have always been able to act. I am definitely interested in it. Doing drama you learn to cope with everybody and work for the drama and not for yourself,” said Senarathne.
A very good way
Anuththara Elpitiya feels drama builds character. “Drama is a very good way to develop your personality such as public speaking. You get to know the ways of speaking to the audience. When we were in the Middle School we did a production of ‘Sound of Music.’ I got to play the part of Captain Von Trapp. So that was a very good way to get over the fears of speaking. Coordination is also really important when you do drama. Drama is a very good thing for your future. It supports you to build as a person,” said Elpitiya.
Very different
Lavanya De Mel, showed much resilience and adaptability.
“I first got into drama when we did ‘Sound of Music.’ I was Maria. Before that we had only done Shakespeare competitions and Shakespeare was very different from ‘Sound of Music.’ Drama teaches you to do a lot of hard work. We practice very hard. Because of our dedication, we became better each day and you could see the progress. This year lots of new personalities came onto the stage, before it was only a small group of people. Their hidden talents all surfaced. We learnt a lot about each other,” said De Mel.
Need to adapt
Kanjini Dissanayake went from a nun to Caesar!
“When you act you get to be a wide variety of personalities. So you are a completely different person. When I did ‘Sound of Music’ I was a Nun. When we did Shakespeare’s Antony and Cleopatra last year, I was Caesar. It is crazy how you have to change your personality! So you really need to adapt to the role and to the environment. It was hard getting into ‘Caesar’s skin.’ You really need to practice and deepen your voice and walk properly. But towards the end it was okay. I was also motivated by everyone. All the teachers were helping,” said Dissanayake.
Really productive
Hiruni Hitihamu spoke about looking at things from different perspectives. “Drama helps you and gives you the opportunity to express yourself in a different way. In drama you get different characters and you have to think from their perspective. That is very helpful in developing their confidence to go out there and speak to the audience. That helps you develop your personality. So I think it is really productive,” said Hitihamu.
Confidence
Rachel Sun felt that she got a lot of strength from her cast members. “When we did ‘Macbeth,’and I was really nervous to be honest to be in front of people! But when I was with my friends they gave me confidence. So I think drama gives you a lot of confidence,” said Sun.
Daily News also met the Primary School Girls who were especially adorable and sweet. They were very precocious and talkative. They excitedly spoke about their achievements. At the Zonal level they won the first place. They won first place at the provincial level as well. And now they are getting ready for the all island.
