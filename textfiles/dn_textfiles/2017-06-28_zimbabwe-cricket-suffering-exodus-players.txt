Zimbabwe cricket suffering from exodus of players

Lack of playing opportunities leads to top cricketers going overseas:
The state of Zimbabwe cricket today is a sad story. When they were granted Test status in 1992 Zimbabwe were looked as one of the top contenders in world cricket with a galaxy of cricketers of the calibre of Dave Houghton, Andy Pycroft, the Flower brothers Andy and Grant, Eddo Brandes, Heath Streak, Alastair Campbell, Neil Johnson and Murray Goodwin to name a few.
But over the years Zimbabwe cricket has deteriorated to the extent that they are no longer the cricketing force they were once in the world, but just another team making the numbers with countries like Bangladesh, Afghanistan and Ireland who were granted Test status after them forging ahead.
At present Zimbabwe is ranked tenth and last in the Test standings and 11th out of 12 in ODIs.
Fast bowling all-rounder Heath Streak who was part of the Zimbabwe team when it was at the zenith of its powers and who is currently their head coach described the decline as the lack of international cricket that Zimbabwe plays today that have made players seek greener pastures.
“It’s well documented there’s been a lot of players who have left and are playing around the world who come from Zimbabwe,” said Streak at the media conference held at Movenpick Hotel yesterday after the Zimbabwe cricketers arrived for a five-match one-day international series and a one-off Test against Sri Lanka.
“It’s been tough for Zimbabwe to retain some of these players and hence we are constantly rebuilding. As we speak now we got a lot of young guys in our team. If you look round the world and look at Zimbabweans internationally we got the likes of Gary Ballance, the Curran boys (Sam and Tom) who just started playing for England, Kyle Jarvis playing county cricket successfully.
“We got a lot of these guys out there whom we are trying to lure back. Part of their problem is that the volume of cricket that Zimbabwe plays, that’s something that we can’t address, obviously it’s a catch 22 situation. We’ve got to play good competitive cricket for other country’s to give matches for us and that’s something we are really targeting and hopefully get some of those players to return to Zimbabwe and complement a talented group of players that we have brought to the shores of Sri Lanka,” he said.
Having to coach a team that is constantly losing some of its best players Streak described as ‘a big challenge to any coach’.
“You inherit the players and your job is to try and get the best out of them. I certainly think that the team we’ve got here has got the ability to win against any side,” said Streak.
“It’s going to be a challenge because of the lack of cricket. We have these big gaps in between series and that’s probably our biggest challenge to get the guys to get used to playing at elite level. We had some good preparation coming into the series and I am looking forward to a lot of guys who can pull around. The future of Zimbabwe cricket is brighter if we keep doing the right things,” he said.
Streak and the team manager represented Zimbabwe at the press conference as Graeme Cremer the captain was indisposed.
Sri Lanka captain Angelo Mathews said that the off-field incidents that had taken place ahead of the series would not affect his team when they take on Zimbabwe in the first of five ODIs starting at Galle on June 30.
The team has been in the limelight after the cricketers were accused of being unfit by the Sports Minister following their dismal performance in the recently concluded Champions Trophy in England, the resignation of coach Graham Ford and the comments made by fast bowler Lasith Malinga against the Minister.
“What happens outside the cricket field we don’t think a lot about it. Our job is to concentrate on our cricket. As players we always look to perform well,” said Mathews.
“It’s beyond our control (Graham) Ford leaving. Our job is to go out there and perform at our very best. Fordy has been fantastic, one of the best in the business but we’ve got to move on and look ahead towards this series.”
