Champion swimmer, SLIIT student understands importance of balance

SLIIT Student Shehan Kaushalya understands the importance in finding the proper balance between pursuing swimming at the highest level and studying Information Technology.
Swimming, like any sport, consumes an enormous amount of time. When one reaches a certain level balancing swimming activities with academics and a social life can be even harder to manage.
Participating in the sport since he was young, Shehan represented his alma mater Royal College bringing home many accolades and medals. He was adjudged the Champion swimmer at the Inter-house Aquatic Championships 2013 at Royal College and his school swimming tenure culminated in being elected as the school Swimming Captain in 2014.
Shehan has performed exceptionally well at many local and international meets including the 9th Asian Swimming Championships 2012, Dubai (UAE), the 4th Asian Schools Swimming Championships 2013, Macau (China), he was the Runner-up Champion at the National Swimming Championships 2013, placed 3rd in the 100m and 200m backstroke at the Tri-Nation swimming championships in Karnataka, India 2011 and broke records in 100m and 200m backstroke events at the Sri Lanka Schools Aquatic Championships, 2013.
Winning and participating in local and international swimming events helps he says to, “Inculcate a disciplined routine that is manageable helping me compete at the highest levels.”
However, for a young, aspiring swimmer/university student Shehan has also learnt that using strong time-management skills help him excel both in the classroom and in the pool.
Despite walking a tightrope of balancing athletics and undergraduate academics, Shehan continues to showcase his prowess in the pool.
Participating in the Short-Course National Aquatic Championships 2016, Shehan was placed second in the 50m Backstroke and third in the 100m and 200m Backstroke andhis team emerged first in4x100m Relay.
When it comes to balancing studies and sports, Shehan gives credit to his lecturers and coaches. “They understand what drives me and that I came to SLIIT to get an education,” he said.
SLIIT recognised his achievements by awarding him the Most Outstanding Sportsman for Year 2016 at the recent SLIIT Colours Awards Ceremony.
However, he notes, “Juggling the classroom and the pool can have its benefits. One activity can relieve the stress from the other.”
