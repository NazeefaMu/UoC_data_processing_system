Maithri Panagoda conferred with  Order of Australia
Lyrical lawyer

Since leaving Sri Lanka in 1975, he spent all my energy in raising a family and building a career in law. It was not an easy task, first in England, and then in Australia. He neglected what he enjoyed most as a teenager, creative writing. By the time the children had grown up, and he had managed to find his place in the world, he was in his late fifties. He wanted to get back into creative writing but felt that he had left it for too long. His Sinhalese vocabulary was almost empty. “I had difficulty in expressing in poetic Sinhala the thoughts and feelings that came to mind. It was a frustrating experience and I was ashamed of myself. However, my determination was stronger than my ability at that time,” muses Maithri Panagoda, who teaches law as an adjunct professor at the University of Notre Dame in Sydney. Panagoda is also one of the few Lankan born Australians bestowed with Australia's Highest Award Order for Citizens and Professionals.
His poetry collection titled Hada Mumunana Handa and CDs titled Mahamera Se and La Hiru Res will be launched at Sri Lanka Foundation Institute on July 11 at 4 pm. Saman Athavudahetti will compere the event while Tillakaratne Kuruvitabandara and Sunil Sarath Perera will deliver the speeches. The vocalists who will sing Panagoda’s lyrics include Professor Sanath Nandasiri, Jagath Wickramasinghe, Rohana Siriwardana, Chamika Sirimanna and Sachintha Panagoda.
Q: You have been writing and publishing poetry and lyrics since the 1970s. Some of your early lyrics have been sung by prominent Sri Lankan artists such as late Maestro Amaradeva, and Pandith Sanath Nandasiri. Some of your lyrics/songs with patriotic themes were playing in the SLBC's morning show in the 70s. Then why did you leave your native country and settled down in Australia, and why Australia and why not UK where you had your postgraduate work or USA?
A: I entered Colombo University in 1969. During my undergraduate days, I used to contribute to Sinhalese Sunday newspapers and various magazines. I took part in radio programmes. I was among the young crowd that responded to the appeal for patriotic lyrics that came from the SLBC. I was fortunate that late Premasiri Khemadasa, the musical genius took a liking to my lyrics and arranged for young artists such as TM Jayarathna, Visharada Neela Wickramasinghe, HR Jothipala, Niranjala Sarojini, late Abeywardene Balasuriya to sing my songs. Although I studied law and was admitted to practise law in Sri Lanka, my ambition was to be a journalist. It was to follow a course in Journalism that I left for England in 1975. However, the realities of life meant that I was destined to be a lawyer first and a writer second.
Q: Since you settled down in Australia I understand that you have been heavily involved and continued your lyric-writing in addition to your contribution to community work in Sydney. Could you provide information on some of your work with the Sri Lankan community in Sydney?
A: After six years in England, during which time I learnt the facts of life the hard way, and collected postgraduate qualifications and experience, entered married life and welcomed a baby son, I migrated to Australia in 1981. I worked as a lawyer for indigenous Australians which taught me a lot about the inherent unfairness in the legal system, racism, and the need to do more for the disadvantaged and marginalised members of the society. I was also privileged to be able to serve the Sri Lankan community in New South Wales.
Q: Why are you still writing in Sinhala and how do you find time as you are a very busy legal professional?
A: I believe that I have gained "lost ground" and that I am almost back to where I would be had I not taken a break from writing following my departure from Sri Lanka in 1975. However, time remains my biggest obstacle in getting back into serious writing. My natural inclination is to write poetry and songs in Sinhalese. However, I have started jotting down some autobiographical notes in English. I do want to attempt to engage in creative writing in English at some future time.
Q: Perth-based poet Sunil Govinnage opines that you are one of most successful Sri Lankan domiciled in Australia. Plus, you are one of the few Sri Lankan born Australians bestowed with Australia's Highest Award Order for Citizens and Professionals. In which areas of work have you contributed to Australian society? Do you have a plan to serve either literary or community work in Sri Lanka?
A: I guess success is a matter of opinion and a subjective point of view. I am happy about my work in the legal field in Australia. I have had the privilege of being involved in some landmark cases. I was probably in the right place at the right time. I have every intention to continue my work in Australia while trying to spend more time in Sri Lanka.
Q: I understand that Sydney is the most vibrant Sri Lankan cultural centres compared to other States and Territories. It is home to well-known and talented writes such as Yasmine Goonaratne, Sunil Govinnage, Palitha Ganewatta, Laxman Koddituwakku, Saman Dissanayake and Michelle de Kretser writing and publishing in Sinhala and English from Sydney. Would you please share your thoughts on the literary activities in Sydney?
A: Melbourne is a place of high volume Sri Lankan cultural activities. Other states produce a sprinkle of creative from Sri Lankan expats. Sunil Govinnage from Perth is a giant among us minions. I think he has produced more publications than any other Sri Lankan living in Australia. Sydney has a number of notable writers who are a better-organised group. The Writers’ Guild is an active group who meet regularly and make a significant contribution to the maintaining and harnessing of the available talent pool.
Q: Do you think that both Sri Lankan and Australian governments should look into the cultural exchange programs through a formal policy benefiting both countries?
A: This is an issue that needs to be taken up at ministerial and diplomatic levels in the two countries. It will definitely be beneficial to the expats, their children and of course the writers living in Sri Lanka.
Q: What are your literary plans or work in progress?
A: I am still a practising lawyer and there are constraints in my time. On the plus side, my children have grown up and my family responsibilities are much less. While experiencing the joy of spending time with my four grandchildren, I intend to attempt at some serious writing in both languages. I have had the privilege of representing litigants in some landmark Australian cases. The Kuru V State of NSW is one such case that went all the way to the High Court (which is the highest court in Australia, similar to the Supreme Court in Sri Lanka). I represented a person who was a victim of police brutality. We were successful and the client received a substantial amount of damages/compensation. The case is being studied in law schools and it defines certain police powers in the State of New South Wales. I have also represented indigenous people in a number of “deaths in custody” matters. The most significant area is “Stolen Generation Litigation” where I have successfully represented over 200 Aboriginal people. This has never been achieved in Australia before.
