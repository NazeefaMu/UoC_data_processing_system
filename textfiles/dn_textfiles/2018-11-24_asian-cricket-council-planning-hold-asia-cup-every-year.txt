Asian Cricket Council planning to hold Asia Cup every year

Asia Cup, this year, was a huge hit despite it was played in the United Arab Emirates. India emerged as the winners of the tournament edging Bangladesh out in a thrilling final. The Asia Cricket Council (ACC) seems to be delighted with the success of the tournament as it is now planning to stage the competition every year. The same was discussed during the annual meeting in Lahore.
Bangladesh Cricket Board’s President Nazmul Hasan who is also the newly elected President of the ACC, returned to the country after chairing the meeting and fronted the reporters. He informed during the interaction that the ACC is moving the right direction and the decisions were taken with everyone’s consent during the meeting.
“The ACC is moving towards the right direction. We don’t have anything special to do here. All the decisions we have made here were taken unanonimously, and they were really for the betterment of cricket,” he was quoted as saying by bdcrictime.
“We have several tournaments (under ACC’s banner). We are planinng to hold the Asia Cup every year. Then we are organizing in the Under-19 level as well. We also have the Emerging Asia Cup. We are doing all these for the development of Asia cricket. Keeping that in mind, we have taken so many steps, and still we are making some more. So we definitely are in the right direction,” Nazmul further added.
It will be interesting to see when the final decision will be taken about arranging Asia’s top tournament every year as it will need to find a window for the scheduling of the competition. - crictracker
