Dry rations for drought hit families in Anuradhapura this week

The distribution of dry food rations among the drought hit families in the Anuradhapura district will commence this week.
President Maithripala Sirisena, who was in Anuradhapura yesterday (12), instructed Anuradhapura Government Agent R.M. Wanninayake to accelerate the drought relief programme.
Wanninayake said a dry food ration pack is worth about Rs. 5000. A packet contains dhal, wheat flour, cow pea, sugar, canned fish, dry fish, potatoes and big onions.
He said 1,50000 families would receive dry rations in the district. Sathosa and district cooperative authorities will distribute the dry rations under the supervision of 22 divisional secretariats.
President Maithripala Sirisena also participated a ceremony held at the Thalawa Mahaweli Grounds to grant land deeds to 6,000 Mahaweli farmers yesterday.
He said at the occasion that natural disasters not confined only to Sri Lanka. India, China, and Japan face more severe natural tragedies, he said.
President Sirisena said every drought affected family would be provided with sufficient relief and compensation.
