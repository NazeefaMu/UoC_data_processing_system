Emirates A380 makes smooth take off from BIA

An Emirates A380 Aircraft landed at Bandaranaike International Airport (BIA) Katunayake, helping Sri Lanka and the airport achieve an aviation milestone.
Take off and landing on the Emirates’ one-off Airbus A380 Dubai-bound flight EK 655 from Colombo’s Bandaranaike International Airport (BIA) was smooth.
The BIA runway was recently upgraded by extending its ‘shoulders’ on either side by 7.5 metres which enables larger plans to land and take off smoothly.
Emirates flew its third-generation A380-800 aircraft bearing registration A6-EUB which is relatively new – just 12-18 months old with 5,000 flying hours.
Sri Lankan Captain Udaya Tillekeratne and Emirati First Officer, Saeed Almheiri led the Emirates A380 one-off flight to Colombo   
Flight EK 654 from Dubai touched down at BIA early evening on August 14. The aircraft returned to Dubai as flight EK 655 at 10.10 pm with smooth take off.The aircraft carried a full load of passengers in all three classes: 14 in First Class, 76 in Business Class and 429 in Economy Class.
Flight deck crew were Captain William James and First Officer Marcelo Lobato.
Commenting on the runway and take off, Captain James said, “Nice new runway. A complete retrofit. Good conditions for take off.”
Emirates hopes to deploy the A380 on scheduled services from Dubai to Colombo and beyond to Singapore which has easy connections to Melbourne with just a hour’s transit at Changi Airport.
Sri Lanka’s Minister of Transport and Aviation, Nimal Siripala de Silva MP was at the airport to greet Abdul Hameed Abdul Fattah Kazhim Al-Mulla, UAE Ambassador to Sri Lanka and Emirates' Senior Vice President Commercial (West Asia & Indian Ocean), Ahmed Khoory who were among the VIPs on the flight, the first A380 commercial flight to the country.
Welcoming guests Ahmed Khoory said, “This one-off flight reflects the strong relationship we have with the market and our commitment to the destination. It signifies that, when demand for the destination grows, as it definitely will, to the point that scheduled A380 flights are feasible, Emirates will be ready to operate one.”
“For the BIA, this event signals that it is ‘A380 ready,’ and that the world’s largest A380 operator – Emirates – has already operated a commercial flight. Given the Sri Lanka government’s focus on developing tourism, this is an important development.
For local aviation enthusiasts it is a matter of pride that their airport has joined the ranks of leading international airports in the A380 league,” he added. 
Abdul Hameed Abdul Fattah Kazhim Al-Mulla, Ahmed Khoory, Minister of Transport and Aviation,Nimal Siripala de Silva MP and senior officials exchange gifts.
