HealthNetBuy brings  convenience to online shopping for medical needs

Shopping for all your medical needs has now become a breeze as HealthNetBuy.com launches in Colombo offering a safe, secure and hassle free method of purchasing prescribed medication at an affordable price.
The process is quite simple as all you need to do is place your order either via their call centre hotline, website, WhatsApp or Viber. Their team of certified pharmacists will fill out your prescription and deliver it to your doorstep within 24 hours of order.
Introducing this novel concept to Sri Lanka are two professionals from the pharmaceutical industry Deeshana Basnayake and Rangika Wijesinghe. 
Deeshana Basnayake, Director and CEO, HealthNetBuy.com speaking about the launch of the online facility said, “We started the online pharmacy in 2016, with a soft launch, seeing the positive response over a course of ten months we have now officially launched in Colombo. With a current reach of a 20km radius from Colombo 05, we intend to expand this distance within the year to other main cities outside of Colombo.
Deeshana further added, “We are always mindful of the fact that, as an online pharmacy, our job involves many complexities and sensitivities. This is why we put in that extra effort and care into our work and assure the highest level of discretion in our services.”
Rangika Wijesinghe, Director and COO at HealthNetBuy.com added, “One of our main plus points is the fact that you can buy all your medical needs in one place from prescribed medication, over-the-counter medication, vitamins, nutritional supplements, surgical equipment and devices. This would largely avoid the hassle of having to go from one pharmacy to another fulfilling the prescription. We pride ourselves on the fact that we do not substitute the prescription given by the medical consultant at HealthNetBuy.com; which means we fulfil the prescriptions only with what is been prescribed.”
HealthNetBuy.com has a dedicated in-house team of pharmacist that you can communicate with via their hotline, WhatsApp, Viber or email to clarify any queries you may have with regards to your prescriptions.
They can work with your primary health care provider to make sure you obtain the medication that is right for you.
