Pattinson ready to seize Test chance

Melbourne, Thursday : Australian paceman James Pattinson said Thursday he was ready to seize his unexpected chance in next week's historic New Zealand third Test following the retirement of Mitchell Johnson.
The 25-year-old played the last of his 13 Tests against South Africa in March 2014 with his career stalled by chronic back and hamstring issues.
Pattinson said he was surprised to be added to Australia's 13-man squad for the first-ever day-night Test in Adelaide, but with the sudden retirement of Johnson he is vying with Peter Siddle for a spot in the bowling attack.
"People who know me know that I go 100 miles an hour all the time... if I get injured I get injured," he told reporters. AFP
