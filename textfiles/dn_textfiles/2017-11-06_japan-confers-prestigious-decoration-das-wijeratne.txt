Japan confers prestigious decoration on Das Wijeratne

The Government of Japan announced the conferment of ‘The Order of the Rising Sun, Gold Rays with Neck Ribbon’ upon Das Wijeratne, past President of the Sri Lanka – Japan Business Co-operation Committee, in recognition of his significant contribution to strengthening economic relations between Japan and Sri Lanka, on November 3.
A congratulatory message was sent by Japanese Foreign Affairs Minister Taro Kono, on November 3 upon the announcement, stating “Please accept my sincerest congratulations on the conferment of the Order of the Rising Sun, Gold Rays with Neck Ribbon, in recognition of your outstanding contribution and my best wishes for your continued good health and happiness.”
Wijeratne held executive posts at several reputed companies in Sri Lanka, while serving as a senior member of the Executive Committee of the Ceylon Chamber of Commerce. He was a founder member of the Sri Lanka – Japan Business Co-operation Committee (SLJBCC), which was the first Bilateral Business Council formed by the Ceylon Chamber of Commerce in 1979. He served as the Vice President of SLJBCC since its inception and went on to be the President from 1992 to 2009.
During his presidency for almost two decades, in cooperation with the SLJBCC’s counterpart, the Japan – Sri Lanka Business Co-operation Committee (JSLBCC) of the Japan Chamber of Commerce and Industry, Wijeratne repeatedly led many Sri Lankan business delegations to Japan and hosted many Japanese business delegations in Sri Lanka.
