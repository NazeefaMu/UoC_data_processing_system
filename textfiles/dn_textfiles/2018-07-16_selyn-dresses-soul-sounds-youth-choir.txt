Selyn dresses Soul Sounds Youth Choir

The Soul Sounds Academy Children's Choir were proudly adorned in the Sri Lankan Ethical brand, Selyn at the prestigious World Choir Games in Tshwane, South Africa. Winning the Silver Medal in the Children's Category and a Bronze Medal in the Folk Music Category, the young champions represented Sri Lanka in a range of Selyn’s handloom sarongs and jewellery made by traditional weavers based across the Selyn handloom villages which are located in the rural outskirts of the North-Western, Eastern and Southern provinces of Sri Lanka. Founded in 1991, Selyn is the only Fair Trade guaranteed handloom company in Sri Lanka that engages the traditional Sri Lankan community of handloom weavers and other rural women artisans.
