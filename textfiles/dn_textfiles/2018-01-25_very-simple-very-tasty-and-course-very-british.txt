The Taste of Britain Curry Festival at Hilton Colombo
Very Simple, Very Tasty and of Course Very British!

A team of British chefs are here in Colombo to showcase their talent at this British food promotion, which is organised by the UK trade magazine, Curry Life.
Hot, mild, creamy or dry, any way you like it, the fact still remains: CURRY has come to be the UK’s number one national food. The curry, which originates from the Indian Sub-Continent, now outsells even fish and chips. Some twelve thousand curry restaurants in the UK cater to ever-increasing love of British curry cuisine.
“In the UK We have a well established National Curry Week which is celebrated in October each year, “ said British High Commissioner James Dauris at the media launch held on Tuesday.
Curry powder started to become available in the UK in the 1700s and the first curry powder recipes were published in 1780.
The taste of Britain Curry Festival, is indeed a celebration of a branch of British cooking which has its roots in the historical relationship between Britain and the Asian region, the High Commissioner noted.
Speaking at the media launch Festival Director & Organizer Syed Belal Ahmed said that the British Cuisine is doing fantastically well.
“The aim of the festival is to showcase the best of British Cuisine and the work of some of the UK's most creative chefs. The festival team will also be going on a food trail to taste local cuisine in Colombo and get inspiration from the famous Sri Lankan dishes for their menu back home in Britain,” he added.
Rupert Rowley, one of the most experienced and celebrated Michelin Starred chefs in the UK, heads the Taste of Britain team to Colombo. The other award winning chefs are Vijay Singh Panwar from London, AbulMonsur from Chatham, Kent and Syeduz Zaman Kamran from Warrington, Cheshire and Shamsul Islam, Food Hygiene Specialist, who provides food safety and quality compliance. They are here to produce a range of new dishes giving a spicy twist to traditional British meals as well as classic high street favourites like Chicken Tikka Masala, Balti and Ceylon dishes.
“British food for me is a passion. My hobby is cooking. Every day we see new things, so many new ingredients, so many new ways of cooking. It is not only about cooking, but also about trying new things,” said Michelin Star Chef Rupert Rowley at the media launch.
Rupert will be showcasing Sri Lankan seafood inspired British menu, while his curry chef colleagues will offer a classic British curry menu during the festival.
