Perpetual CEO’s opposition to phone and laptop, struck down

The Treasury Bond Commission yesterday rejected a submission made on behalf of Perpetual Treasuries CEO Kasun Palisena questioning the power of Commission of Inquiry on making an order to handover communication devices belonging to him.
Kalinga Indathissa PC made the submission on behalf of Palisena.
The PCoI issued an order on August 01, under section 7 of the Commission of Inquiry Act, directing PTL CEO Kasun Palisena to produce his mobile communication devices and laptop computers and also to submit an affidavit containing information relating to the use of these devices other than at the stage of Palisena giving evidence.
Indatissa PC made a submission on August 3, that the Presidential Commission of Inquiry investigating into the treasury bond issue, has no power to require Palisena to produce his mobile communication devices and laptop computers.
The Commission notes that there is “no merit or substance in Indatissa’s submission that, this Commission of Inquiry has no power to require Mr. Palisena to produce his mobnile communication devices and his mobile computer devices other than at the stage of Mr. Palisena giving evidence”.
Issuing an order yesterday (14) PCoI observes that such submissions were not made when Arjun Aloysius and Arjun Mahendran were ordered to hand over their mobile communication devices and laptop computers. On August 4, Palisena produced two mobile phones to the PCoI which were kept under sealed cover in the custody of Secretary of the PCoI.
Palisena was permitted by the PCoI to retain his mobile computer device until he complete his evidence. Palisena is testifying before the PCoI at present. The Attorney General will be cross examining Palisena then.
The PCoI also disagreed with Indatissa PC’s submission that procedure followed by the Commission of Inquiry up to now is flawed as a result of the PCoI not having formulated Rules. It also did not agree with another submission made by Indatissa PC stating that it is only the PCoI which may determine the witnesses to be called and when they are to be called and record statements of witness, instead of the Attorney General’s Department summon, determine to summon or record statements from witnesses.
The minister made special mention about the delays in hearing court cases and added that steps have to be taken to rectify anomalies.
He went on to say that files on 80 cases related to corruption and fraud committed during the past regime have been handed over to the Attorney Generals department about one year back after completing investigations.
The minister lamented the delay in taking legal action against those responsible for the malpractices and added that in this backdrop it was natural for one to feel whether such delays were intentional.
