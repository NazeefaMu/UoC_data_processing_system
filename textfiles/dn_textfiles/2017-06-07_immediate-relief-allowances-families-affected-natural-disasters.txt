Immediate relief allowances for families affected by natural disasters

 
Minister of Disaster Management Anura Priyadarshana Yapa said that the families, which were affected by natural disasters, will be paid an immediate relief allowance of Rs.10, 000/- until a proper estimation of their damages are calculated.
The Disaster Management Centre in its latest report says that about 2,789 houses have been totally ruined while 18,420 houses are partly damaged.
“Every house that is damaged due to this flooding and landslides will be compensated and that amount of compensation would be limited to a maximum of Rs. 2.5 million rupees,” said the Minister.
