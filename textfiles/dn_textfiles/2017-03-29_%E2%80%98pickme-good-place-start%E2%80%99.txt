‘PickMe, Good Place to Start’

PickMe; Sri Lanka’s home grown technology based taxi hailing service is well into its second successful year of operations. Whilst they have expanded their network and introduced more user friendly features to their app, their success story lies not just in their daily increasing fleet but their young and dynamic staff. PickMe is the ideal place for techno geeks i.e. app developers to let loose their skills.
The Company is constantly on the lookout for talented young people who can find ways to make their App even smarter. As a tech based operation PickMe, gives priority to young people who are skilled in developing software.
When the Company first launched the hailing service with their app, there had been only 15 people on their staff and they achieved the goal of becoming a credible, established service in a very short time.
Another significant aspect about PickMe is that they are not looking for highly qualified app developers when they are looking to recruit. According to CEO, Zulfer Jiffrey all comers are welcome provided they make the cut.
Some of the PickMe staffers were eager to speak about the opportunities they had to advance themselves within the Company. Rishoban Jeevamohan, who started out as a beta passenger, joined PickMe as a Customer Communications Executive.
According to Keshan Fernando who is a software engineer, PickMe for a one year old start-up has grown rapidly. “We keep working towards taking the Company to the next level. We are given many opportunities to grow with the company. Regular appraisals and the training we get help us to succeed in our career. Zulfer says that there is a common misconception that PickMe is a place for tech-wiz’s and IT professionals. “That is far from the truth, technology plays only a 50% role in the business. Operational activities are of equal importance.”
This is further confirmed by staff members who say that company operations are a ‘nice mix.’ They believe that the success of their app is due to giving the operations side of the business equal importance, as the satisfaction of their passengers and drivers has helped the PickMe’s rapid growth.
Given the relaxed yet lively office atmosphere, all of PickMe’s employees seem to love their jobs. “I want to work here for as long as I can,” says Neerja Vimaleswaran, a Software Quality Assurance Engineer. She says as a woman in what is considered a male dominated industry; she does not feel unequal to her male co-workers. “I don’t feel any gender inequality here; everyone is just equal.”
