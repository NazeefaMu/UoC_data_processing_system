Five instances when cricketers were fined for the most bizarre reasons

The game of cricket requires “gentlemanly” conduct from all its players. The Code of Conduct is written and enforced by the ICC (International Cricket Council), which is to be followed by all cricketers. On going against the rule, the punishment may vary from a fine, ban of few matches or even a lifetime ban.
The match referee, appointed by the ICC, holds the power to set penalties for the offences. Not just offences pertaining to cricket, there have also been instances when cricketers were fined for surprising off-field offences.
Here we take a look at 5 instances when cricketers were fined (match fee or personal) for reasons both bizarre and funny.
5 GAUTAM GAMBHIR – FOR KICKING A CHAIR
Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR) skipper Gautam Gambhir was fined 15 percent of his match fee for breaching the Indian Premier League (IPL) Code of Conduct in 2016. Gambhir’s offence was kicking a chair in the dugout after his side beat Royal Challengers Bangalore in a league match at the M. Chinnaswamy Stadium.
It was widely assumed that Gambhir, who is always high on emotions on the field, kicked the chair out of the excitement of winning.
“Gambhir admitted the Level 1 offence (Article 2.1.8) of abuse of cricket equipment or clothing, ground equipment or fixtures and fittings during a match. For Level 1 breaches of the IPL Code of Conduct, the Match Referee’s decision is final and binding,” a statement from the IPL read.
#4 MATHEW HAYDEN – FOR BREAKING A GLASS DOOR
Former Australian opening batsman Mathew Hayden was reprimanded and fined by the ICC after he smashed a glass panel in his team’s dressing room. Hayden’s rage was a result of his LBW dismissal for just two runs in the fifth Ashes Test at the Sydney Cricket Ground in 2003.
Match referee Wasim Raja fined Hayden 20 percent of his match fee, around $2200 after the Australian was found guilty of the charges levied upon him.
“At the hearing, Matthew Hayden admitted the offence and apologised for his action,” Raja had said in a statement.
Like Gambhir, Hayden too was charged with a level one offence of the code of conduct, in “abuse of cricket equipment or clothing, ground equipment or fixtures and fittings”.
#3 DALE STEYN FOR SPITTING ON SULIEMAN BENN
South African pacer Dale Steyn’s entire match fee was fined by the ICC for spitting at West Indian all-rounder Sulieman Benn during the third Test of a three-match series in Barbados.
“South Africa fast bowler Dale Steyn has been fined 100 percent of his match fee for breaching the ICC Code of Conduct during his country’s third Test match against the West Indies,” the ICC said in a statement.
On being bowled by Kemar Roach in the 132nd over of South Africa’s first innings, an agitated Steyn spit in the direction of Benn, a charge which was brought up by on-field umpires Steve Davis and Simon Taufel, third umpire Asad Rauf and fourth official Clyde Duncan.
“Dale’s behaviour was entirely unacceptable and he knows that,” said match referee Jeff Crowe.
#2 VIRENDER SEHWAG AND HARBHAJAN SINGH – FOR ENTERING NEW ZEALAND WEARING DIRTY SHOES
Although this fine was not levied for offensive actions pertaining to the 22 yards, it still remains Indian cricket’s one of the most interesting stories of cricketers being fined. Spinner Harbhajan Singh and batsman Virender Sehwag were fined by New Zealand`s Ministry of Agriculture for arriving in the country with dirty shoes in 2002.
The two were fined 200 NZ dollars ($100) at the airport for their dirty footwear.
New Zealand boasts of bio-security laws which are designed to safeguard the country from several imported diseases like foot and mouth diseases among others. If the two cricketers had declared their shoes, they would have been cleaned at New Zealand taxpayers’ expense and handed back to them.
#1 RAVINDRA JADEJA – FOR CLICKING SELFIE WITH A LION
Indian cricketer was fined 20,000 rupees for posting photos of him and his wife posing in front of endangered Asiatic lions at the Gir National Park. Officials at the park said they imposed a fine as “the cricketer flouted the rules”, according to which no visitor in the park is allowed to leave their vehicles and step down.
Coincidentally, Jadeja posted those photos only a few days after Gujarat forestry officials had warned of the dangers that can be caused by taking selfies with lions. The Gir National Park, on the western side of Gujarat, is the only place where Asiatic lions remain in the wild. - SK
