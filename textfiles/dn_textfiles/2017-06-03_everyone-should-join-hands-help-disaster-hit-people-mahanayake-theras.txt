Everyone should join hands to help disaster hit people: Mahanayake Theras

Everyone should join hands to rebuild the lives of the community affected by the recent national disaster, the Mahanayake Theras of the Three Nikayas said in a statement issued yesterday.
Relief efforts should continue until the lives of the people affected by landslides and floods are re-established, they said.
The statement was issued by Most Ven. Tibbotuwawe Sri Siddhartha Sumangala Mahanayake Thera of the Malwatte Chapter, Most Ven. Warakagoda Gnanaratana Mahanayake Thera of the Asgiriya Chapter, Most Ven. Napane Pemasiri Mahanayake Thera of the Sri Lanka Ramanne Maha Nikaya and Most Ven. Kotugoda Dhammavasa Mahanayake Thera.
The statement added that the devastation caused by the floods and landslides which followed the heavy deluge was immense. A lot of lives were lost, several others gone missing and hundreds of thousands of people were displaced. We should resolve to continue relief efforts without disruption until people's lifestyles were re-established, the statement said.
The prelates said they would conduct ‘Punyanumodana’ to invoke blessings on the government, electronic and print media institutions, state and business institutions, the public and the Maha Sangha engaged in providing assistance to the distressed people.
It would also be pertinent to apportion part of the funds earmarked for Poson festivals and decorations towards relief work, the Theras said.
At the conclusion of Poson pinkam, it would also be appropriate to share a thought about the people who lost their lives and transfer merit on them, they said.
The Prelates said they would invoke the blessings of the Trividha Ratna and the sacred Tooth Relic on the flood affected people to enable them restore their lives speedily.
They would transfer merit on those who lost their lives, they said.
