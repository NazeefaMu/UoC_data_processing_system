Second U19 four-day test at Hambantota:
Sooriyabandara scores fighting century but Lanka follow-on

Royal College cricketer Pasindu Sooriyabandara stroked a fine century but Sri Lanka was forced to follow-on in the second U19 four-day test against India played at Mahinda Rajapaksa Stadium, Hambantota yesterday.
Facing a huge Indian total of 613-8 declared, Sri Lanka replied with 316 with Sooriyabandara hitting 17 fours in his 236-balls knock of 115.
With Sonal Dinusha who scored a half century off 144 balls (8 fours), Sooriyabandara added 128 for the fifth wicket, but apart from their stand only Sandun Mendis made any sort of worthwhile contribution with 49 off 109 balls (8 fours).
Left-arm medium-pacer Mohit Jangra claimed the lion’s share with four wickets. Forced to follow-on Sri Lanka slumped to 47-3 by the close of the third day, still trailing by 250 runs with seven wickets in hand to avoid back to back innings defeats. Today is the final day.
