Further trial against Dhammaloka thera fixed for October 15

The case filed against Ven.Uduwe Dhammaloka Thera for keeping a baby elephant without a valid licence was yesterday fixed for further trial by the Colombo High Court.
When the case came up before High Court Judge Sampath Wijeratne, the defence sought a further date for defence evidence.Accordingly, the case was fixed for further trial on October 15.
The Attorney General (AG) had filed indictment against Ven.Uduwe Dhammaloka Thera on two counts for allegedly possessing a baby elephant without a valid licence.
This is the first time in Sri Lanka an accused had been indicted in the High Court by Attorney General over an offence of possessing an elephant without valid licence following amendments to the Fauna and Flora Protection Ordinance in 2009.
The indictment has been filed over two counts come under section 22 (12) of the Fauna and Flora Protection (Amendment) Act, No.22 of 2009 and section 5(3) (a) of Public Property Act. The Attorney General had named 19 persons as witnesses in the case and three documents as production items in the case.
Wildlife Department officials took into their custody a two and half year-old elephant calf which was found inside the Alan Mathiniyaramaya Temple in Polhengoda on January 28, 2015.
The Attorney General maintained that Dhammaloka Thera had illegally possessed a stolen property, a baby elephant without a valid licence, an offence under the Fauna and Flora Act. The Attorney General further alleged that the accused had also committed a punishable offence under the Public Property Act since he had intentionally kept a baby elephant without a valid licence. The Attorney General alleged that the accused had committed this offence around January 28, 2015 within the Colombo High Court’s jurisdiction.
