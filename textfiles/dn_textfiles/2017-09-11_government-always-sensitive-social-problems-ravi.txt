Government always sensitive to social problems: Ravi

“The National Consensus Government is always sensitive to social problems. It is prepared to resolve any issue by discussing it with the people,” Parliamentarian Ravi Karunanayake said. He called on Ven. Elle Gunawansa Thera at the Dharmaramaya, Colombo 7 and received his blessings on September 8.
He said that if recent statements made by Minister Sarath Fonseka had caused a problem, what ought to be done was to discuss and resolve it without dragging it further. Ven. Elle Gunawansa Thera in his anusasana described Ravi Karunanayake as a leader greatly needed by the country and advised him to continue his efforts to strengthen the UNP.
The Thera said he regretted the statements made against him by Minister Sarath Fonseka. He said the Government became unpopular due to such statements.
Ven. Gunawansa said he always stood for the interests of the country and its people. He said he was against the sale of country’s resources to foreigners and wished to raise his voice against such moves at the next elections.
