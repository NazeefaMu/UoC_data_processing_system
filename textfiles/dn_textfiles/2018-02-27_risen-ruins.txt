Risen from ruins

Once a verdant land, it has now become a ground scattered with battle-hardened corpses. Blood oozing from lethal wounds, these lifeless bodies feed the videographer. The videographer is surrounded by men in amber green uniforms with light green stripes treading the ruins.
With that masterful visual portrayal of postwar Sri Lanka, Prasanna Vithanage begins the country’s latest cinematic experiment: an anthology film by Prasanna Vithanage, Vimukthi Jayasundara and Ashoka Handagama with their relatively shorter films titled as Her, Him and The Other.
Surrounded by men in striped uniforms, Keshavarajan’s job was videoing the dead bodies of Sinhala soldiers to produce propaganda films. Kesa himself was present when the filmed version of his story was shown before a sect of the Colombo crowd. Vithanage, Jayasundara and Handagama are known for their controversial manipulation of the Sri Lankan war in their cinematic works. Roaming in different paths of imagination, the trio assembled in one place to formulate the cinematic anthology.
War is over. But does that mean that every worry is over as well?
Not quite so, as Prasanna Vithanage believes.
Isolated humans
“We have to admit that the ethnic problem has not been solved yet in this country. We have not been able to build one Sri Lankan nation. No, we have not reached that level as yet. Guns are silent. But mistrust among each other still prevails. The political leaders did spread this mistrust in order to establish their own power in their territories. That drove me to make this film,” Vithanage mused.
A Sinhalese sees a Muslim or a Tamil as an ‘other’, and vice versa. That should never be the case, Vithanage believes. You need to look closely into the other to find out yourself. Prasanna Vithanage had the common man in his mind when he made the first film of the anthology, Her. The film has a simple outline. Anyone can delve into deep readings if necessary. Vithanage has chosen an alternative route as well. The speed is much faster than the rest of his films. The shutter speed is also relatively slower.
Her introduces two real-life persons as leading actors: Keshavarajan a propaganda videographer pouring his heart out to Ashoka Handagama in the outskirts of Jaffna. Already burdened with no suitable actress who doesn’t mind being touched by an actor, Handagama nevertheless settles down to lend an ear to the stranger.
Why Ashoka Handagama?
“My story is based on a true event, though some events are dramatised. This is Kesa’s story. He met me following the war and related the whole story. He burst into tears while narrating the story.”
Perpetuity of humanity
Kesha has seen wounds in the war. He has seen death. He has seen violence. How can he be so emotional then? This dilemma has made a splash on Vithanage. War can amputate and even annihilate one whole ethnic race, but it cannot destroy humanity.
“I wanted Ashoka Handagama in the cast to build up the story. He has been to Jaffna and produced films such as Ini Avan. Plus, Kesa has met him before. Handagama actually had to face a problem of finding an actress who would not mind being touched by an actor. I merged these events to breathe in drama.”
Suppose it was a commercial film director and Kesa would not have been able to be much honest. Sri Lanka’s commercial film directors have made no connection with the northern hemisphere. Hardly speaking a word, Handagama opts to be a listener attentive to details. In the end, Kesa’s story influences Handagama. He decides that Kesa is the best person to make the film. Handagama accepts that the Tamil filmmakers should be given a chance to make their voice heard.
“What we have right now is a Sinhala cinema. That should become the local cinema. The Tamil-speaking people should be given chance to express cinema in their language. We should absorb them into the local cinema.”
Creative comfort
Every film has been a challenge for Vithanage. Yet this particular film has been a good opportunity for him to visit Jaffna and share Kesa’s story with the aspiring scriptwriters and filmmakers. Her is an offshoot of a workshop held with them in Jaffna.
“That is what I see as the biggest achievement. We built up this story. This was not something planted from above. We had a discourse with them as to how this could happen. We didn’t recruit a single actor from Colombo. Every actor was from Jaffna.”
Following the end of war, Prasanna Vithanage held numerous workshops in areas such as Jaffna, Batticaloa, Trincomalee. As a result, the northern hemisphere has now become a breeding ground for budding filmmakers. Short films are the trending phenomenon like in any other area. Quantity is increasing, though the quality is always a question.
“When I sit on a jury of short films, I grow frustrated. We have to watch about 50 films. Most of the films are closer to teledramas. They are not creatively rich. But we come across one or two best productions. Really, we get to see about 25 in the great cinema. Only two or three films are better. And those few are a cut above the rest.”
Whenever he is into making a film, Vithanage’s concerns lie with the probable outcasts of the society. The outcasts have to grapple with the social influences and various other vices. Wannihami of much noted Purahanda Kaluwara is such an outcast who had an eternal struggle. Vithanage claims to have never been driven by the urge to make money out of films. Sitting before a blank piece of paper, he takes time to reflect on the feelings of a particular character.
For instance, how would someone feel when seeing a picture of a recently deceased beloved one?
“I have never thought of making a blockbuster movie through such situations. I am concentrating on the human feelings. I believe that I genuinely try to understand their feelings. My aesthetics are based on the visual expression of that concentration. It should be a cinematic expression. The aesthetics are formed by a coherence and clarity.”
If Lester James Peries wanted to make a blockbuster when he made Gamperaliya, Delovak Athara and Nidanaya, Vithanage elaborates, we would not be able to see characters similar to Jinadasa and Kaisaruwatte in our surrounding. Vithanage’s aim is to empathise with the character. The beat of the character and the beat of the audience will then coalesce.
“That curiosity of searching for truth leads me. For instance the external elements of this conversation of ours matter much lesser than the truth that comes out of it. Every artiste creates from his subjective truth and that leads to the objective reality. The subjective reality I see becomes an objective reality. The human nature doesn’t come out simply when people talk sitting. But it comes to the fore when people behave. That’s what I call arts.”
Opportunities misused
The younger generation has ample opportunities to make films thanks to the sophisticated digital environment. But the doors of the traditional entertainment are not open to most of them. Even though a young filmmaker wins an award, the private sector is reluctant to offer sponsorship because films do not generate much money in this country. On the contrary, the younger generation has other avenues open in YouTube, Netflix and Amazon for online streaming.
“The people go to theatres only to watch blockbusters. Even there you see lights blink with people constantly checking the updates on their smartphones. To enter this region, you need to have good stories and experiences which should be expressed in a novel manner. This is the challenge before us now.”
That is where the script matters.
Adds Vithanage: “When we read scripts, we come to realise that these writers have distanced themselves from both English and Sinhala. As a tip to budding filmmakers, Akira Kurasowa instructed to read widely. A filmmaker should be well read. Kurasowa used to say how he was influenced rereading Leo Tolstoy. Every time you reread, you see something you had not seen before.”
So learn from the masters, Prasanna Vithanage offers advice to any would-be filmmaker. Literary masters offer lessons on how to express a rounded experience. Without literature, we cannot look forward to good cinematic works.
“Most young filmmakers tend to be lazy because now everyone can make a film and somehow upload it to the Youtube. Uploading is not what matters. How far can you address the audience? For that, you need to build the trust. How do you maintain the story? There are people who do not go the cinema. You need to win them. If not, then the foreign films will take that place. The audience does not care whether it is a foreign film or not,” Vithanage elaborated.
