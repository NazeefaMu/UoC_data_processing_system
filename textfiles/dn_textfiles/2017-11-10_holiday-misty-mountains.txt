Holiday in misty mountains

Hotel Secret is a beautiful little boutique hotel situated in the picturesque mountains of Ella. It is an unforgettable destination. The backdrop of the misty mountains, the warm hospitality of the staff and the cozy bungalow create the perfect environment for rest and relaxation. The Motto of the hotel is to give a value added service by providing the best from all aspects.

The ownership of the Bungalow passed into the hands of the well- known Gardiner family in Sri Lanka. In 2014 it was bought over by our company - the UHE Group family business and we transformed it into a boutique hotel. Now it is open to foreign and local clientele. This is an ideal destination for families to come relax and enjoy,” said Founder Chairman and CEO of the UHE Group, A.P.D. Abeyrathne.

The Sutherland Suite and the Planters Suite are also very spacious rooms which can be converted to triples. Sutherland suite has its historical image of an English living room with a fire place (Mantelpiece) and a design embossed brass ceiling. Garden chalets are individual wooden bungalows with a balcony overlooking the beautiful valley and mountain views. The interiors of the rooms must be seen for one to believe. They really are of a class of their own,” stated Abeyrathne.
