Arjuna refutes Namal’s allegations

Ports and Shipping Minister Arjuna Ranatunga yesterday said that neither the President nor the Prime Minister requested him to sack employees attached to the Hambantota Port.
Refuting allegations by Hambantota district parliamentarian Namal Rajapaksa that the Prime Minister has given instructions to sack employees attached to the port, Ranatunga said the government has not taken any decision to terminate their services.
“We could have sacked more than 500 port employees who canvassed for the former President during the last presidential election. But the President or the Prime Minister has never taken such a decision.”He said Rajapaksa had enrolled over 200 employees to the port but no one was sacked.
