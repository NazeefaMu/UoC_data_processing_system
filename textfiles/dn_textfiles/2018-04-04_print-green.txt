Print  GREEN

Printing soil, water and seeds with a 3D printer to draw miniature gardens, it is the goal of the Print GREEN project, started in 2013 and designed by students from the University of Maribor in Slovenia. By modifying a traditional 3D printer, the students designed a printer that works with a paste made of soil, loam, water and seeds, allowing the printing of objects ready to grow!
