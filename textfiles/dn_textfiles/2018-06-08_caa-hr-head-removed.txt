CAA HR head removed

An acting Human Resources head has been appointed to the Consumer Affairs Authority (CAA).
CAA sources said the former head has been sent on compulsory leave and a committee appointed to conduct a full investigation into allegations levelled against him in connection with serious corruption and malpractices.
The CAA Chairman, Director General and several senior officials were taken ‘hostage’ yesterday evening by employees demanding the removal of the CAA human resources head.
