Soil shortage delays Southern Expressway extension

Construction activities of the Southern Expressway extension project were delayed due to the soil shortage, Road Development Authority Chairman Nihal Sooriyarachchi said.
The chairman said the country has a shortage of soil caused by the regulations imposed on soil mining and transportation. Many other construction activities in the country were also delayed due to this situation, he said.
He said measures were taken under the guidance of the President and the Prime Minister to resolve the issue. The government imposed new regulations on soil mining since permit holders violated regulations, he said.
