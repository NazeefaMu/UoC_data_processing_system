Samarawickrema calls for probe into pepper fiasco

 
Development Strategies and International Trade Minister Malik Samarawickrama requested State Minister for International Trade Sujeeva Senasinghe to appoint an independent committee to probe into allegations made against Board of Investments (BOI).
Justice and Buddhasasana Minister Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe, at a conference last week alleged that the BOI is selling pepper imported from Vietnam in the local market, causing a drop in prices of locally produced pepper.
Minister Malik Samarawickrama said that the committee should also probe whether other goods brought in by BOI companies are sold illegally to the local market, without paying the required duty.
