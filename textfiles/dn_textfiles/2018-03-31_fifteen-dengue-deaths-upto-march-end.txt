Meanwhile, medical experts and consultants advise the public to seek medical treatment without delay for any type of fever without applying home remedies. All fever patients need rest and they should not attend work or school.
“All patients with a fever should take only Paracetamol. All the other medications, especially Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs (NSAID) such as Ibuprofen cause Dengue Haemorrhagic Fever (DHF) which can become fatal, medical experts added.
