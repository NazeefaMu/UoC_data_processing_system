69th National Day celebrated in Netherlands

The National Day, marking the 69th Anniversary of the Independence of Sri Lanka was celebrated at the Embassy on February 4 in The Hague.
The National Flag was hoisted by the Ambassador of Sri Lanka, A.M.J. Sadiq to the accompaniment of ‘ Magul Bera ‘, in the presence of a large number of Sri Lankans, Dutch friends and well-wishers. The National Anthem was sung in Sinhala and Tamil, followed by the observance of 2 minutes silence in remembrance of all Sri Lankans who had sacrificed their lives for the country. The lighting of the oil lamp by the Ambassador, Second Secretary and the Attaché followed.
Religious observances were conducted by 4 religious dignitaries representing Buddhist, Hindu, Christian and Islamic faiths.
Children from all four communities represented in Sri Lanka, lit the oil lamp, symbolic of the ardent desire and aspiration of all peace loving Sri Lankans for national unity and genuine reconciliation. The Ambassador highlighted the need for all Sri Lankans to acquire at least conversational ability in the three languages of Sri Lanka, namely Sinhala, Tamil & English, which would help create a new society in which people would be able to truly appreciate the value and benefit of life in a multi-cultural, multi-faith and multi-linguistic environment. In this manner, it would be possible for all communities to embrace and cherish the rainbow diversity of the nation.
