Four more nabbed in leopard killing

Four more suspects were arrested by Kilinochchi Police on Sunday for the brutal killing of a leopard at Ambalakulam in Kilinochchi on Thursday.
The police arrested the suspects by reviewing the pictures and video footage released after the Kilinochchi Magistrate’s Court ordered the arrest of the suspects.
The suspects are aged between 22 and 24 years and are residents of Krishnapuram and Pirimandanaru.
They were scheduled to be produced before the Kilinochchi Magistrate’s Court, yesterday. Earlier, two suspects were arrested on Sunday regarding the killing of the leopard. A total of six suspects were arrested and Kilinochchi Police are conducting further investigations.
The villagers of Ambalakulam, last Thursday (21), complaining that the wildlife officers were not able to control the leopard which they claim to have attacked several people including a wildlife officer while hunting their cattle and goats, had beaten the animal to death with clubs.
