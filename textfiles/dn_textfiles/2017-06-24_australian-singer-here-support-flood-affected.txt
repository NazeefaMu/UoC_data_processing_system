Australian singer here to support flood-affected

An Australian singer, songwriter and music composer Tamara St. John will be in Sri Lanka today to help victims who lost their family, home and belongings during the recent floods.
Tamara will be in Sri Lanka for a week to meet some of the victims and lend a helping hand. During her stay, she will meet with her fans and local artistes to ascertain potential collaborations and also she will take part in television and radio interviews.
Tamara will be visiting some of the rural areas in Sri Lanka to meet victims of the flood tragedy including children in Poogoda. She had raised a considerable amount of funds from her latest music video ‘Rain’ featuring Gershom Moses for this charity work. Some of her family members too had given their contributions in this regard. The donations will include providing basic necessities for pre-school education for children such as drawing books, exercise books, pencils, pastels, cutters, lunch boxes, water bottles and other stationery.
Tamara had engaged in charity work for Sri Lanka on previous occasions too.
She had helped raise funds for children receiving treatment at Maharagama Cancer Hospital. She had also built a special wing for children at Maharagama Cancer Hospital.
Tamara had even helped victims of the Tsunami in 2004. During the time, she had coordinated a disaster recovery plan with the management of a hotel to provide food and beverages, medical treatment, clothing, phone lines, rest area and a shower for victims.
