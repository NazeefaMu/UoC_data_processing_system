CEA raids Pettah, Dematagoda for banned polythene

The Central Environment Authority (CEA) Waste Management Unit carried out the first raid regarding the newly imposed ban on polythene on Wednesday at Pettah and Dematagoda, jointly with the Environmental Police Unit.
CEA Waste Management Unit Deputy General Manager Upali Indraratne said raids on banned polythene items would be carried out throughout the country this month.
The government imposed a blanket ban on shopping bags, lunch sheets and regifoam lunch boxes throughout the country from September 1, 2017. Following a grace period of four months, the CEA announced that the law would be strictly enacted from January.
Accordingly, manufacture, sale and use of polythene or any polythene product that are 20 microns and below, lunch sheets, grocery bags, food containers (lunch boxes), plates, cups, and spoons from expanded polystyrene have been prohibited. Indraratne said attention has been directed to raid manufacture and sale of banned polythene items in the first stage. He said several offenders were nabbed during the CEA raids on Wednesday at Dam Street and People’s Park Shopping Complex in Pettah and shops and factories in Dematagoda.
The items had been taken into custody and legal action had been initiated against the offenders. However, Indraratne expressed his satisfaction that most shopkeepers and factories had shifted to bio-degradable polythene related products.
