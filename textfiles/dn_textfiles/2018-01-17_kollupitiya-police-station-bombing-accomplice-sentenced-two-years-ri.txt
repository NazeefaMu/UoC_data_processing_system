Kollupitiya Police Station bombing: Accomplice sentenced  to two years RI

A female accomplice of the LTTE woman suicide bomber who attacked the Kollupitiya Police Station premises to assassinate Eelam People’s Democratic Party (EPDP) Leader Douglas Devananda, was yesterday sentenced to suspended-imprisonment by the Colombo High Court.
The accused, 43-year-old Selvakumari Sathyaseelan, a resident of Jaffna, was sentenced to two years Rigorous Imprisonment (RI) suspended for 15 years, for aiding and abetting charges. The accused was further ordered to pay a fine of Rs. 25,000 by High Court Judge Vikum Kaluarachchi. She was released from the first count owing to a discrepancy in the indictment.
The High Court Judge said he was compelled to pass a lenient sentence against the accused, since she was kept in remand custody since 2004; a period of 13 years.
It was revealed during the trial that the LTTE had forcibly selected the accused to accompany the woman suicide bomber, as she had access to Minister Devananda’s office.
The Attorney General had filed indictments regarding the LTTE suicide bomb attack incident at the Kollupitiya Police Station on July 7, 2004, where four police personnel were killed.
