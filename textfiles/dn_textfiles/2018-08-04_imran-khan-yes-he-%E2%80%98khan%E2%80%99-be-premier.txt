IMRAN KHAN - Yes he ‘Khan’ be the Premier!

Memories of IMRAN KHAN that excellent all round cricketer who will be Pakistan's next Prime Minister remain vivid. When Sri Lanka made its first Test tour to Pakistan in 1982, I was the first journalist to accompany the Sri Lanka team and describe the Three Test series as Sports Editor of the ‘Times’ Group. And what a delight it was to meet the handsome IMRAN KHAN! who is our ‘SPORTS LEGEND’ today.
During that series, I first met the dashing, debonaire and handsome KHAN when he played in the Second Test in Lahore. I was introduced to the likeable IMRAN by Pakistani journalists Qamar Ahmed, Chisty Mujahid, Salahuddin and Ali Baig. And while waiting for a taxi at the Hilton Hotel, KHAN gave us a lift to the Lahore Cricket Ground in his vehicle where the Second Test between Sri Lanka and Pakistan was to begin.
KHAN came into this Test after refusing to play in the First owing to some controversy. Pakistan won the First Test in Karachi. In the Second Test the Sri Lankan batsmen were given a baptism of fire by KHAN who bowled beautifully with speed, late both way swing and accuracy to instill fear and bundle out the Lankans to easily win that Test.
Vicious inswinger
One incident that is vivid in my mind was the vicious inswinger he delivered to send batsman Rohan Jayasekera’s middle stump cart wheeling to wicket keeper Wasim Bari. That delivery cut in like a vicious off spinner bowled by former England great Jim Laker.
KHAN from the time he took to the game as a little kid, showed great promise of becoming one, if not the greatest cricketers the game and the world was going to see as in later years his career began to zoom.
Growing up and sporting film star looks, the tall and handsome IMRAN KHAN not only began to take by storm the cricket scenes he played in, not only in Pakistan but in all international venues .
Expert comments
Incidentally on that tour and in that particular Test I was asked to give expert comments on Pakistan Radio which was broadcasting the Test, by Wasim Tariq one of the top cricket commentators of that era. And of course my comments were all about KHAN!
With the home grown umpires tending to be unreliable and questionable with their controversial umpiring, it was KHAN who first mentioned the concept of neutral umpires that later came into vogue and still persists thanks to the sponsorship of EMIRATES AIRLINES who sponsored this concept and still do.
Ball tampering
With ball tampering now rampant in the international cricket scene, the latest offender to be found guilty being captain Dinesh Chandimal of Sri Lanka, KHAN once admitted that he used to scratch the ball with a bottle top to gain unfair advantage and swing the ball that batsmen found unplayable and being dismissed inexplicably.
KHAN attraction was not only his cricketing prowess but being handsome to a fault he got the ‘glad eye’ from the beauties!
The Oxford educated Pathan was bracketed with Sir Garfield Sobers of the West Indies as the greatest all rounders that the game of cricket has seen.
That was because as a new ball bowler, he bowled every conceivable swing and vicious bouncers, could take apart any penetrative and damage causing bowling attack with his bat that he used like a rapier and could field equally well.. As captain he was a marvel
As captain he was a marvel. With an extraordinary cricket brain, he would quickly spot the weakness of a batsman and instruct his bowler showing him how to knock a batsman out.
Cricketers of the brand of KHAN are not on the scene now and not likely to be born. His crowning moment in the game that he adorned with aplomb and great respect was leading Pakistan to victory against England in the World Cup in Australia in the 1992 final beating the country that gave the game to the world.
No Pakistan team has since laid its hand on the World Cup. It was not a great team that KHAN led, but with clever captaincy he turned them into world beaters. KHAN suffered a terrible blow in his career that was heart rending when he lost his beloved mother to the terminal illness.
Having watched his mother suffer, he realized the suffering others suffer with this dreaded illness and set about building a Cancer Hospital which is a reality now.
Biggest heartthrob
KHAN the charismatic aristocrat has been described has being one of the biggest heartthrobs. Suave, erudite and monstrously talented living cricketer in the subcontinent, real sex appeal in the 1970s and 1980s.
KHAN who played most of his cricket in England, first at Oxford University rarely showcased his talents in Pakistan, was a regular for English counties Worcestershire, known as the sauce county and Sussex for which country former South African and England captain Tony Greig and Sri Lanka’s Gehan Mendis played.
‘You must go when everyone is asking why and why not’, was KHAN'S reply when questioned on retirement. KHAN also created a sensation when after three drawn series against England he led the team to a series victory against the opponents in 1987 when with explosive spell of fast bowling he took a match bag of 10 for 77 at Headingly on which venue Sri Lanka scored its first historic Test series win against England.
Test cricket in Pakistan again?
It would be interesting to wait and watch with keen interest whether KHAN can use his influence to bring back international cricket to the cricket starved fireball that is Pakistan. International cricket was called full stop after the attempted bombing of the Sri Lanka cricket team and its miraculous escape.
KHAN was born on October 5, 1952 in Lahore, Punjab and the teams he played for were –Pakistan, Dawood Club, Lahore, New South Wales, Oxford University, Pakistan International Airways, Sussex and Worcestershire.
KHAN’S cousins were former Pakistan captains Javed Burki and Majid Khan. KHAN made his Test debut against England at Birmingham on June 3, 1971 and figured in his final Test vs Sri Lanka in Faisalabad on January 2,1992. His ODI debut was when he fronted up to England at Nottingham on August 3, 1974 and quit against England at Melbourne on March 25, 1992.
Played in 88 Test matches
KHAN played in 88 Tests, playing 126 innings with 25 not outs scoring 3807 runs with a highest score of 136. He made six three figure scores, 18 half tons. In ODI cricket he played 175 games batting 151 times with 40 not outs making 3709 runs with a highest score of an unbeaten 102 with one century and 18 fifties.
His Test bowling figures were – 362 wickets and best match bag of 14 scalps. Best figures in ODIS 182 wickets and best figures in a match 6 for 14. After quitting the game, he plunged into the highly volatile political scene in Pakistan and all countries will be watching whether he has the political acumen to lead Pakistan to use a biblical term into the promised land.
We here at ‘T’N’C’ of the leading morning daily the ‘DAILY NEWS’ wish IMRAN KHAN well in his new game POLITICS.
