A proposal in this regard, would be submitted for Cabinet approval, next month, he said, adding that a welfare scheme for SLTB employees had been planned for the purpose.
A sum of Rs.200 million had been disbursed for the purpose, the deputy minister added.
“The SLTB had earned a profit of Rs.1.618 million this year, after 48 years. All EPF and ETF amounts would be settled accordingly, in future,” Deputy Minister Abeysinghe said.
