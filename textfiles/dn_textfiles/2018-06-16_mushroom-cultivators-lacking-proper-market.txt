Mushroom cultivators lacking proper market

It is harvesting time for farmers who engage in mushroom cultivation in the Ampara district. However, mushroom farmers in the Ampara district currently face hardships as there is no proper market for their produce. Mushrooms can be cultivated and harvested within a month, Akkaraipattu resident and mushroom cultivator S. L. M. Naasir said.
It can be cultivated in small areas without any difficulties.
With the increase in the number of diabetic patients, the demand for mushroom is increasing, he said.
At present, a kilo of mushroom is sold at Rs. 350.
