Responding to UNHRC resolution
Japan to extend fullest cooperation to Lanka

Japan will extend its fullest cooperation to Sri Lanka in responding to the UNHCR resolution through a domestic mechanism, said Japan’s Foreign Minister Fumio Kishida when he met Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe at the Imperial Hotel in Tokyo yesterday morning.
He said the efforts taken by the present government of Sri Lanka to rebuild and regain local and international confidence lost during the past is most commendable and praiseworthy.
Kishida said as a close friend Japan would assist the new Sri Lankan government of good governance with all possible assistance towards its efforts to build a new country.
The Japanese Foreign Minister also commended Prime Minister Wickremesinghe for steering Sri Lanka towards a non aligned foreign policy breaking off from the past decade.
Kishida said he firmly believed that the mutual discussions between the two countries in the next few days would help further cement mutual relations between Sri Lanka and Japan.
Japan, he said, was paying constant attention towards attempts made by the National Unity government to create an environment conducive for investments in state and private sectors.
Prime Minister Wickremesinghe said Japan was one of the five countries Sri Lanka established relations after gaining independence.
The foundation for Sri Lanka-Japan friendship and relations was laid by late President J.R. Jayewardene. It was taken forward by subsequent leaders of Sri Lanka, he said.
The Prime minister said the two main parties in Sri Lanka had come together to establish a national unity government after six decades.
The new government under the leadership of President Maithripala Sirisena was striving to take the country forward by stabilising good governance, democracy and human rights. Sri Lanka had dedicated itself for the cause of peace in the region and help and assistance from Japan was vital in promoting peace and development in the Asia Pacific region, he said.
Since Asian representation in the UN Security Council was insufficient Sri Lanka would lend its full support to Japan in seeking a seat in the Security Council, the Prime Minister said. Ministers Ravi Karunanayake and Susil Premajayantha, Secretary to the Prime Minister Saman Ekanayake, Sri Lanka Ambassador in Japan Prof. Dhammika Ganganath Dissanayake, Assistant Secretary to the Prime Minister Saman Athaudahetty, Senior Advisor to the Prime Minister Prof. Monty Cassim, Advisor to the Ministry of National Policy and Economic Affairs R. Paskaralingam were also associated with Prime Minister Wickremesinghe at the discussion.
Japanese Ambassador in Sri Lanka Kenichii Suganuma, Director General South Western and Eastern Asian Division of the Japanese Foreign Ministry Takio Yamada and Takashi Ariyoshi were among the Japanese delegation present.
