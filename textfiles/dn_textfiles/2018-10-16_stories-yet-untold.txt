Stories, yet untold

First, there was nothing. She had hardly anything to write down. But she never gave up doodling and squiggling. Perched on the ground, the little girl would watch over her author-parents. In a little while, she finds herself ambling along the rivers and lakes where the willows grow, naturally looking for inspiration.
Growing up, she stumbled upon thoughts, words and stories. Then there was everything.
Charulatha Abeysekara Thewarathanthri entered the literary limelight when her manuscript, Stories, won the Gratiaen Prize in 2017. Later released as a Sarasavi publication, her work caught the attention of both Godage National Literary Awards Ceremony and State Literary Awards Ceremony to be chosen as the Best Novel in English medium. More meaning was added when her father was posthumously honoured at the State Lit Fest with the award for the Best Screenplay in Sinhala (Welikathara). If only those in attendance knew the father-daughter relationship, Charulatha would have received a well-deserving standing ovation on that special day.
As the daughter of Tissa Abeysekara, a cinema czar of his generation and Pushpa Meewella, a veteran writer, linguistic excellence seems bequeathed to her. Charulatha’s story is simple but not without marvel.
For Charulatha, no novel must be published without a proper editing process. Now, that is something quite unheard of in this part of the world. Yet Charulatha chose to be among the few even following the Gratiaen accomplishment. She submitted her work to two literary editors.
“Chapter by chapter they sent in the comments. I agreed with most comments. A few comments I did not quite agree with and left it at that. I made the changes accordingly. The comments were mostly centred on how certain ideas could be presented in a better manner. In certain instances, they suggested different wording. They noted how some of the words did not carry the meaning in its entirety. Restructuring certain paragraphs was another suggestion. In another instance, I was asked to provide background information,” Charulatha goes into details of her editing process.

She received a constructive feedback from the Gratiaen judging panel as well. Professor Sasanka Perera, the chair of the panel, for instance, elaborated how he felt the book could be improved. He recommends a more informative and descriptive narrative form to make the plot more picturesque for the readership.
All this sharpened her tools of the trade. It brought out the story.
Although editing is alien to Sri Lanka, Charulatha insists on editing without which publishing should never take place.
“There is an always editing process involved. Usually, the publisher provides the editor. The editor works closely with the writer to improve on the story being told. The idea is to tell the story in every possible way that it can be told,” Charulatha explains.
And she adds the problem as well. If an editor offers a comment, the writer feels obliged. Which is not necessary. Finally, the option is solely yours. It is your story. Your write it. You work on it. That gives you full authority over what you need to change or not. Easier said than done, however, as the writers usually approach someone with authoritative seniority to get the editing done. When they put forward a suggestion, their seniority or the authoritative scholarship compels you to oblige.
“It is a delicate balance. You have to strike a balance of not offending your editor and working closely with them. My editors were marvellous that way. They sent the comments but gave me the option. They never forced me to accept their comments and work on them. If you feel like resubmitting the work, then you shall do it by all means. But remember every submission has an editor’s fee involved. The editor decides on the price. They have a look at the story first. Sometimes it is the word-count. Sometimes the page-count. If you can come to terms with the fee, then go ahead,” Charulatha sheds some light on the editorial enigma.
On a different note, Charulatha quotes Madubhashini Disanayaka Ratnayake who is on record as saying that the Sinhala writers are light years ahead of the English writers. The English writers in Sri Lanka have so much to mature in terms of language command and how they present their stories.
“The Sinhala writers are far ahead of the English writers, true. But they could also have been benefitted more with an editing process. If you have someone with an authoritative scholarship you can iron out the wrinkles in your book. It is definitely a benefit,” Charulatha puts forward her observation.
The biggest obstacle for the local English writer emerges when they deal with a Sri Lankan story which could have been felt much better in the native tongue.
“Suppose you have been speaking English all your life and suddenly start speaking in Sinhala. The words don’t come out quite well. It applies to writing as well. English is not capable of fully captivating everything that goes in Sinhala, Tamil, Buddhist, Hindu and Catholic lives of Sri Lanka. It takes a great amount of language to bring out the essence in a way to suit the readership. There is a lot to learn, I guess.”
The best source is your mother tongue, Charulatha concludes. But then why did she choose English as her medium? The language came to her as a medium of convenience.
Writing in Sinhala means longhand for Charulatha. That exercise hurts her wrists in the long run. So she chose the writer’s best ally, the laptop, to assemble the wandering thoughts of a nostalgic realm into a proper narrative. Her mother calls the longhand-deviation laziness. Whatever it is, Charulatha cannot turn back now. She has built her literary fortress from stone. Stepping out of that comfort zone requires great effort or exertion – which might not be worth the effort.
