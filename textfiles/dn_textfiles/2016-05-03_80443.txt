Prince’s vault drilled opened

Underneath Prince’s Paisley Park estate is a bank vault full of unreleased music. Now, according to ABC News, the vault has been opened by Bremer Trust, who was appointed administrator of the estate following the musician’s death.
ABC News notes that Bremer Trust was forced to drill open the vault as only Prince knew the key code. Inside they discovered enough unreleased music to release a new album every year for the next century.
According to Prince’s former sound engineer, Susan Rodgers, the vault pre-dates the release of 1984’s Purple Rain. “When I left in 87, it was nearly full,” she explained in an interview with the Guardian. “Row after row of everything we’d done. I can’t imagine what they’ve done since then.”
It remains to be seen whether the music will ever be released. Prince had no will at the time of his death, and already his family members are fighting over his assets.
