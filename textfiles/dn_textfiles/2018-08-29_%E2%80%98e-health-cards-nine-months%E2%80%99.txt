‘e-Health cards in nine months’

A foreign company will invest in E-Health system and issue E-Health cards for Sri Lankans in nine months, Health Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne said.
The Minister was speaking at the 61st Annual General Meeting of the College of Medical Laboratory Science in Colombo recently.
The Minister said the company will include all State hospitals in the E-Health system in four months. It has provided E-Health cards for 40 million people in Andra Pradesh in India, he said. Services should be delivered sans files and documents. Everything should be done through computers. The Medical Science will change when the medical gene technology popularize by 2030. It is in the US now.
The health science service needs Medical Laboratory Technicians (MLTs). The government has provided automated machines (analyzers) for State hospitals and one machine issues 16 blood reports per second. Rs. 2.6 billion was spent on the machines, the Minister said.
