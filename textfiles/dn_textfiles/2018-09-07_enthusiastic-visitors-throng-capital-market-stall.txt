Enterprise SriLanka’ Exhibition in Monaragala
enthusiastic visitors throng Capital Market stall

The government launched the “Enterprise Sri Lanka” exhibition, the first in the series in Monaragala from August 29 to 31, 2018 to enlighten the public on its recently launched Vision 2025 Strategy and to take the message of Enterprise Sri Lanka and Gamperaliya to the people.
The exhibition was held in the District Secretariat premises and was open to the public from 10 a.m. to 12 midnight.
This objective of the exhibition was to empower entrepreneurs throughout the country and was organised by the Ministry of Finance and Mass Media and declared open by Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe.
Over 600,000 entrepreneurs and investors participated at the exhibition. The three-day exhibition included 12 zones and over 500 stalls representing the government, semi-government and private sectors. In addition the exhibition provided the necessary knowledge and training to aspiring entrepreneurs.
The Securities and Exchange Commission of Sri Lanka (SEC) along with the Colombo Stock Exchange (CSE) organised a stall at the exhibition to educate the general public on the benefits of investing and raising capital from the market. Officials of the SEC and CSE were present at the stall to explain the opportunities available in the stock market.
In addition, to cater to the needs of both investors and entrepreneurs, two counters were set up with resource material and continuous presentations showcased the various aspects of investing and listing on the CSE.
Moreover, Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) were able to obtain information and knowledge on the newly launched “Empower” - SME Board which will provide an opportunity for this sector to access capital through the stock market.
The stall generated keen interest amongst the community and participants including professionals, self employed, school children, teachers, undergraduates and farmers.
