Wattala PS Budget  proposal rejected

The Wattala Pradeshiya Sabha’s Budget proposal for 2019, presented by PS Chairman Theyagarathne de Alwis during a meeting held yesterday, was defeated by three votes.
While the governing party’s [Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP)] 16 members voted in favour, the United National Party-led (UNP) Opposition cast 19 votes against the Budget proposals.
Of the four SLFP members who had been supportive of the SLPP, three members voted against the Budget proposals along with the Opposition members, which consist of two Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna members and 14 UNP members.
