Assault on neurosurgeon :
GMOA threatens union action

The government should take immediate steps to arrest the persons who attacked the neurosurgeon of the Anuradhapura Teaching Hospital, Dr. Yohan Koralage, the Government Medical Officers’ Association (GMOA) spokesman Dr. Samantha Ananda told the Daily News yesterday.
If the police and the government fail to implement the law properly against all the attackers, it is possible for the Anuradhapura branch of the GMOA to take trade union action. The law should be implemented against all the attackers without further delay, Dr. Ananda said.
The law has not yet been implemented against the attackers. Ten students of the Peradeniya University Arts Faculty were responsible for brutally assaulting Dr. Koralage near the University’s Obeysekera Hall on August 3 (12 days ago), he said.
Dr. Koralage was admitted to the Kandy Hospital and later transferred to the National Hospital of Sri Lanka. He was in charge of the neurosurgery unit of the hospital and now the service of the unit is at a standstill.
This unit covers the North Central Province, Northern Province and a part of the Eastern Province, amounting to one-third of the country, he added.
