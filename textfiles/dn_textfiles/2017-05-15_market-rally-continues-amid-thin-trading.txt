Point of view
Benchmark Price Index which rallied since late- March continued with its uptrend for the 7th consecutive week amid thin trading on account of the holiday season this week.
The Bourse gained 31 points since last Friday, hitting one year closing high to end at 6671.98 points - helped gaining a 7.1% Y-T-D. Average turnover levels meanwhile were hovering around LKR 0.67Bn during the holiday shortened week (9% decline W-o-W) as investors were relatively muted during this week. Large parcels in Teejay Lanka (22% of the total crossings), DFCC (18% of the total crossings), Hemas Holdings (16% of the total crossings) helped extend the HNI and Institutional contribution to turnover as total crossings accounted for 33% of total market turnover.

Foreign investors continued to remain net buyers for the 14th consecutive week as net inflows increased by 18% W-o-W to LKR 0.21Bn bringing the total net inflows for the year to LKR 16.21Bn.
Similar market momentum is likely in the week ahead and could to be influenced by the direction of Mar’17 corporate earnings.
May policy rates held steady
The Central Bank at its May policy meeting held policy rates steady citing a deceleration of both inflation and private sector credit and improved balance of payment.
(Repo: 7.25%, Reverse Repo: 8.75%). Despite NCPI edging up to 8.6% in March ’17 (cf.2.2% in Mar’16) which was largely due to drought and VAT impact, CBSL projects the inflation to remain in the desired mid-single digit levels by end of 2017 supported mainly by the Monitory policy adjustments which was followed since end 2015 (policy rates were increased by 125bps since Feb’16 to date while the SRR was increased to 7.5% from 6%).
Conversely CBSL also estimate the private sector credit to slow down by end of 2017 to the envisaged levels, as the credit levels showed signs of deceleration from its peak in July’16 of 28.5% Y-o-Y to 21.9% in Dec’16, and further declining to 20.4% in Mar’17 with the upward adjustment in rates.
The monetary authority also added that its policy stance was supported by projected inflows from both government securities market and CSE in addition to the 11th International Sovereign Bond issued worth US$ 1.5Bn. Further disbursement of the 3rd tranche under IMF Extended Fund Facility too is expected to support the BOP and reserve position of Sri Lanka.
