Trinity goes out favourites but Royal can surprise

Rugby fans could expect to witness a tremendously exciting game when underdogs Royal College Colombo, come up against firm favourites Trinity College Kandy, in the first leg of the Singer Sri Lanka sponsored 72nd Bradby Shield rugby encounter which will be played at the Royal College Sports Complex at Reid Avenue commencing 4.30 p.m.
Playing on their home turf should give Royal the advantage yet, the outcome of a Trinity-Royal Bradby game is most unpredictable. The Simithrarachchci Trophy for the juniors will precede the big event and take place at 3.30 p.m.
Royal has a strong, mobile, pack of forwards, while Trinity’s strength lies in their versatile, fleet footed three-quarter line. Possession and handling of the ball will be key factors and to what good purpose they use it, will surely determine the outcome of this game.
Trinity College will be led by fly half and stand in skipper Thisila Perera due to the suspension of their appointed captain and durable Sri Lanka under 19 Junior National second row forward Rahul Karunatilaka, who has led the Lions from the front this season.
Trinity have played four matches so far, winning three and losing their unbeaten run last week to S Thomas’ College Mount Lavinia, where they lost by 23 points to 20 at Pallekelle after a thrilling encounter. Their wins have been over Wesley College Colombo 7-5, St. Joseph’s College Maradana 40-14 and they put up their best performance for the season by virtually thrashing hapless D.S. Senanayake College 65-0.
Meanwhile the Royal outfit beat D.S. Senanayake 36-10, Wesley 17-14 and their only loss was against arch rivals S. Thomas’ College, Mount Lavinia by 21 points to 15, a match they should have won if not for complacency getting the better of them and then coming from behind 10-24 down to hold the fighting St. Joseph’s team to a spectacular 27-all draw last week.
Royal will be led by that hard working Sri Lanka under 19 Junior National prop forward Nikila Gunadheera, a fine leader who led the side in an exemplary manner. In full back Ovin Askey they have a fine place kicker who could tilt the game in their favour with his spot-on kicking. Royal’s only blemish is their defence which has been suspect many times this season.
72nd Bradby
This is the 72nd year since the Bradby started in 1945, when Royal was led by Dr. C.D.L. Fernando and Trinity by Dr. Robert Sourjah. Royal won the 1st Leg 3-nil in Colombo and in the 2nd Leg up in Kandy, Trinity clinched the Shield with a 6–nil victory.
Trinity has won the Bradby 39 times and Royal 31 – but in 1992 it was a tie with a nil-all result in the first leg and a 3-all draw in the second leg. Trinity was led by a cricketer turn rugby player skipper Himesh Goonetilleke and Royal were led Harindu Wijesinghe, now a specialist orthopedic doctor.
Royal highest aggregate score was 83 points in 2002, spearheaded by Zulkie Hameed; while Trinity’s highest aggregate was obtained in 2012 with 70 points. They were led by that brilliant centre three quarter Kaneel Seneviratne who has won two ‘Lions.’
Royal is the present custodian of the Bradby Shield having won it last year under the captaincy of centre Bhanuka Gamage by an aggregate of 72–22. The first leg played at Trinity grounds in Pallekelle saw the Royalists earn a hard fought 23–22 win but they crushed the Lions by the biggest margin of 49-nil in the second leg played at Royal Sports Complex, Colombo.
Trinity won the Bradby for six years in a row, from 1952 captained by Mervyn Panditharatne to 1957 captained by Ken de Joodt, while in 1971, Royal under the captaincy of F.R. Perera, won the first leg by 22 points to 3 but due to civil disturbances in the country, the second leg was not played. Trinity’s Principal Lionel Fernando magnanimously decided that he would award the Bradby Shield to Royal and it was accepted as one of the finest sporting gestures. The Principal of Trinity travelled down to Colombo and awarded the Bradby Shield to the Royal captain at the school’s General Assembly.
Father and son as captain
It may be a matter of interest, to know that Ashan Ratwatte was the Captain and “Lion”, an outstanding scrum-half of Trinity in 1983 (100th encounter between both schools), when they won the “Bradby”, winning 14-6 and losing 6-10 with an aggregate score of 20 points to16. He later went on to represent the Sri Lanka national team as a scrum half. Ashan is the proud father of Tarinda Ratwatte, Trinity’s outstanding fly-half cum skipper of 2014 who went on to equal his father’s record by winning 37-25 and losing 9-13 with an aggregate score of 46-38 to win the Bradby as well as the “Lion”. Incidentally they are todate remain as the only father and son ever to captain and win the Bradby Shield for their respective schools.
It’s a great joy
Any young or old Royalist or Trinitian, who took to the game of rugby in school would always say that it was their boyhood ‘dream’ to wear the school rugby jersey and one day play in the “Bradby Shield” encounter!
It’s a great joy to know that both the present Principals of these two great institutions share the same views on maintaining its past glory, befitting the schools that they love. It is not only important to win but to also focus on fair play and good sportsmanship. It is these qualities that ensure the spirit of the game and cherished, now and for future generations.
In today’s game it is hoped that Rugby will be the Victor of this great “Bradby battle”.
May it also be a memorable match for all rugby fans irrespective of which school they come from that they may all say “None can match the Bradby.”
Royal College’s unbeaten 1978 rugby captain, former CR & FC skipper and Sri Lanka national rugby player Rohantha Peiris will be the chief guest and will be introduced to the two teams before the commencement of the match. (WAI)
