SLFP is not anyone’s property: Musthapha

The SLFP is not anyone’s property. The party belongs to the party men, Provincial Councils and Local Government Minister Faiszer Musthapha said.
He was delivering a speech at a ceremony at Seethawaka in Avissawella to open the railroad crossing gate constructed Rs. 2.6 million from the ministerial decentralised funds. The Salawa Road in Ihala Mambula was rehabilitated Rs. 1.2 million and vested with the people the same day.
“The Provincial Councils and Local Government Ministry focused specially on developing the country. As a government, priority is given for public needs. We won’t change public needs to achieve political goals,” he said
“Each development programme implemented under various administrative areas all over the country comes under my ministry. The railroad crossing gate opened today is essential for the security of the public in this area,” the minister said.
Musthapha said the country has only two main political parties and these two parties cannot be destroyed. “Several individuals tried to destroy these parties, but they failed. People are deceived saying that the SLFP will split and some will join the Joint Opposition. The JO leader had done nothing for the politics of this country. Can someone, who has no voter base, split a main political party like the SLFP? The public, especially party men of the SLFP, has no belief in him,” the minister said.
Western Province Chief Minister Isuru Devapriya, Provincial Councillors Sumith Wijithamuni Soyza, Mahesh Almeda, and Lenard Karunarathna also participated. Seethawaka Pradeshiya Sabha former Chairman Ananda Roopasingha organised the ceremony.
