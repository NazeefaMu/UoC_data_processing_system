Kandy SC to play Clifford Cup k/o quarters at Pallekele

The Clifford Cup quarter-final rugby match between Kandy Sports Club and Air Force SC will be played on Saturday February 17 at Trinity College rugby grounds at Pallekelle.
Earlier plans were to play this match at Bogambara Stadium, but the ground is in a poor state and they have decided to play the match at Pallekelle.
If Kandy SC enters the semi-finals, this match will be played at Pallekelle on January 21 Wednesday against the winners of the CR & FC and CH & FC match.
The final are fixed for February 25 Sunday at Racecourse grounds.
The Clifford Cup is the most prestigious club rugby knockout tournament and arguably the oldest rugby tournament in Asia. The Clifford Cup commenced in 1911 and has been played continuously since 1950.
