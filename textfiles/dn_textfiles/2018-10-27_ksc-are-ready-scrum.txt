Kandy badly in need of grounds
Kandy schools are finding it difficult to play their cricket matches, due to the bad weather and lack of venues. What Kandy needs today are playgrounds. Pallekelle ground was made for cricket but today only international games are played. At one time there was a Sylvestrian serving in the grounds committee and his school managed to get the grounds for matches. Today only Trinity, St. Anthony’s, Sri Rahula and Dharmaraja have their own grounds. Kingwood grounds is still not suitable for senior matches.
In the good old days it was the Police grounds and Campus grounds which helped these schools. Today the Police grounds still remain a matting wicket, and campus grounds have various problems. Today some schools go out of Kandy to play cricket. It is high time the politicians who talk big before the elections help schools to get grounds. A school has to spend a lot on ground fees for every sport. All cricket lovers in Kandy hope that their immediate needs be met by the present President and Prime Minister which will help the young sportsmen in a big way for their future.
Bogambara needs a face lift
Historic Bogambara playing field needs a face lift. Today the ground is so hard that most of the participants get injured. It is a ground with a long history. It was in 1897 the ground was converted from a lake to a playing field. A number of sporting clubs including Kandy Sports Club, Young Stars SC, Young Wanders SC, Green Field SC and schools including St. Anthony’s, Trinity College, Sri Rahula College, St. Paul’s (now known as Sri Sumangala College), Dharmaraja College and Kingswood College used the venue to conduct cricket, football, rugby, hockey and athletics. Bogambara was renovated into a stadium in 1972, thanks to the Kandy Municipal Council Special Commissioner of that time M. B. Samarakoon, who initiated the renovation work with support from local politicians such as E. L. Senanayake, Noel Wimalasena, Shelton Ranaraja, and E. W. Balasuriya, a local sports promoter and philanthropist, who assisted in raising donations. In 1997 Amnurudha Ratwatte upgraded the grounds with government funds at a cost of Rs. 89 million. It was re-developed under the patronage of the municipal council and after the redevelopment the Sports Ministry took over the premises, from that day the ground is in a mess The ground fees are on the high side and the less affluent football and hockey clubs are finding it difficult to make use of it.
