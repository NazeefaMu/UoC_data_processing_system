World Bank representatives praised Parliament Reforms and Mass Media Minister Gayantha Karunathilaka and officials of the Right to Information Commission for implementing the Right to Information Laws and appointing the Right to Information Commission within a very short period in Sri Lanka.
World Bank’s Vice President for Equitable Growth, Finance and Institutions Jan Walliser who was in Colombo last Thursday for a two-day official visit with his delegation met officials of the Right to Information Commission led by Minister Gayantha Karunathilaka at the Water’s Edge.
Measures taken up by the Sri Lankan government for the implementation of the Right To Information(RTI) laws and the support given by the World Bank in this regard were highlighted during the discussion.
