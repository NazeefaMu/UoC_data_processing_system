Harry Potter inspired engagement ring

A Harry Potter superfan was given a very special engagement ring that her fiancé had designed to pop the question. Reddit user Katiemack777 took to the online community this week to post a picture of her new jewelry.
The engagement ring features a diamond, but also has small gemstones, in red, green, blue and yellow, each representing the four Hogwarts houses.
Taking to Reddit, she wrote, “My (now) fiancé knows that I love Harry Potter almost as much as I love him, so he designed a pretty special ring for me.”
The ring, which in reality is three rings fused together, features a gold center band with a round diamond in the center.
The two outer bands have smaller diamonds, as well as a quartet of precious stones in the colors of Gryffindor, Slytherin, Ravenclaw, and Hufflepuff.
She explained that the blue and yellow are both sapphires, the red stone is a ruby, and the green is tsavorite.
Her husband designed it himself, and went to Shane Co. to have it made. Other Redditors loved it as much as her, and the post earned thousands of upvotes and hundreds of comments.
Her fiancé even chimed in too, explaining, “I knew I needed to have an extraordinary ring for such an extraordinary girl. It turned out better than I ever could imagine. The ring is definitely enchanted.” IANS
