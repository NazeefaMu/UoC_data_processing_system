Let life begin…

Part 1 of this text was carried in Daily News of March 14 and here, it, predominantly is further intended, to continue the insight-oriented and discernment-directed analysis of the NGO global use and the abuse of indigenous law and international bilateral and unilateral conventions, in order to confuse the clarity and blemish the purity of the minds and justify the virtual criminality of forced abortion and birth-control.
Compromise on every point is the foundation of misery. Those who compromise will not be able to forgive themselves. There, where one could have dared, compromises and compromising proves him to be a coward. In the cowardice, one falls before his own eyes and further loses the self-respect as well. Hence, the compromise with the forced abortion and birth control would not help Sri Lankans to have a better fate than disgraceful cowardice, falling before one’s own eyes and total loss of self-respect.
The truth is, there is a sense of urgency. Of what? Of conscious awareness. Once again, of what? Of the threat and the danger of the destruction, cessation and disappearance of a community in the years to come, in a slow, non-discernible and clandestine agenda of the vested interest. Some would certainly oppose this as an impractical and racist statement.
Nonetheless, real racists are those, who conspire to democratically and peacefully end an innocent and existential nation, through the virtual criminality of forced birth control and abortion. The more so it would be, when the abortion and birth-control-compulsion-criminality is brutalized against all fertile women and men of a nation, for whom, no such requirement, as a medical measure, has been prescribed by doctors and no physical and/or death threat has been dashed against the life of the woman. This situation denotes only one destination – vested interest, conspiracy, deception, taking for a ride and causation of cessation of a nation in to total democratic and seeming-to-be non-violent disappearance.
Muslim example
With all the lamentational polemics of women’s rights violations and cries of human rights transgression, being yelled by NGOs, the Muslim community, with their patriotic women of absolute majesty, have firmly shown the world that there is a community, the members of which cannot be fooled in to the deception of the criminality of converting their innocent God-gifted wombs in to killing fields with oozing out blood of the conceived fetus.
The deceitful propaganda of mind obfuscation, greed-generating financial help and aids, the real-intension-masqueraded women’s rights violation slogan and the rock-cracking palpable lie of the lifelessness of the conceived fetus, have been kicked off as their community-destroying threaty conspiracies of vested interest and the Muslim women, respecting and admiring their religion, the Islam and what is domestically ethical and also not embracing all what is exported from the West, continue to produce their children with courage, perseverance and pride. A vivid example to learn, understand and empirically observe.
Silence of chief incumbents
Whatever is yelled and lamented by NGOs of vested interest, the original name of Sri Lanka is Heladiva and the original community, whom the land belongs to, is Sinhala Buddhist, with the rights of other communities to co-exist with, with the beauty of peace, depth of understanding and the splendor of mutual help. Besides, Sri Lanka is the only country in the globe, wherein, the Buddhism has received the official and contitutionalized state patronage.
In such a situation, the number of Sinhala Buddhist heads, which determines the existential stability of the fate of Buddhism, is a central factor, the Buddhist clergy should be very much vigilant of, careful about and pay attention for. Yet, it is so unfortunate, no Buddhist monk of the higher order, including the Chief Incumbents of main denominations, appear to be resorting to any objection, protest or agitation, in regard to the forced abortion and birth control in Sri Lanka. Here, one may argue that such protest would be against the ethical principles of Buddhism and would end up not in renunciation, but in craving and grasping.
Now, what is the point of renouncing covetousness and grasp, if the Buddhism, as the religion of the original majority community disappears in to total extinction? Indeed, the NGOs of vested interest would be pleased with the Buddhist priesthood, if they would plead silence, conducing the cessation of the Doctrine of the Buddha, by means of the diminution of the number of Buddhist heads. Therefore, the burning span of time has dawned for Buddhists priests and particularly, for the Chief Incumbents of the Order, to temporarily keep the attainment of Nirvana aside, march forward, unite the Sinhala, Tamil and Muslim communities, members of the justice administration mechanism, Army, Police and compel the elected governing politicians to have recourse to drastic measures to chase away the NGOs, who violate the human rights of the men and women of Sri Lanka, by forced abortion and birth control. Now, let’s come back to the original script orientation of the text – the loop holes of international and domestic law.
Right to life standards
Some Courts refute the proposition that international human rights conventions and declarations protect the right to life prior to birth, finding that such documents, including the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and many other international legal instruments do not provide any evidence to substantiate the notion that the embryo could be considered “a person.”
Hence, finally, in addressing the issue of when life begins, the Justice administrators reason that since there is no an agreed definition of when life begins, adopting one such definition “would imply imposing specific types of beliefs on others who do not share them”. In this approach of ignorance, it must be illustrated that what is significant is, “not when life begins”, but the actual fact that “life begins”.
If someone is not sure of the moment of life inception or believes that the human life begins not from the conceived embryo in the mother’s womb, but, from a heap of bones bundled in a grave, then, to consider that the recognition of the rights of the life-potential fetus would be tantamount to the “imposition of a belief type on others, who do not share them” should not and cannot serve as a basis for not recognizing the rights of the fetus. The artificial, mind fabricated gap between the born human and the conceived fetus does not dispel the rights of the embryo to grow in to the state of fetus and the rights of the fetus to be transformed in a human-being.
A subjective opinion, held by a tiny group of individuals, self-declared to be luminaries of a legal community, cannot betray the objective reality, well beyond and above human conceptualization domain, however metaphysical it may seem to be. These people must not be allowed to threaten the very survival of humanity. Thus, the protection of the rights of the life potential fetus is a must.
If a cancer treatment to a pregnant woman could cause an abortion, finding that the State could not deny her life- and health-saving care, the doctors must provide the patient, the necessary medical treatment.
There is no frustrating issue at all. If the life of a woman, whose pregnancy placed her life in grave danger, which under the existing circumstances required termination of the pregnancy, the presence of the embryo can be caused to be ceased. No one would argue about the infraction of the embryo rights. In such extraordinary circumstances, no legal luminary would and cannot prioritize the health or well-being of the fetus over the pregnant woman’s rights. Indisputable indeed. No court would grant to a fetus, the recognition of an absolute right to its life before the birth, if it constitutes a threat to the mother.
Real problem
Now, the real problem of the NGO abortion and birth control contention is problemlessness and their ceaseless endeavours to engender a non-existential doctrinal chaos, in order to perpetuate the continuity of abortion and birth control, in relation to certain especially selected communities, while, certainly proclaiming the principle of the application of universality. Hence, it is high time for all the communities of Sri Lanka to gather together, generate an empirical awareness and pressurize the Good Governance Government to crush all and every nation-destroying attempts, structured with the criminality of forced abortion and birth control.
