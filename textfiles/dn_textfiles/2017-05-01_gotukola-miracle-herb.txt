Gotukola, a miracle herb

 Gotukola also known as Centella Asiatica is one of the most popular plants in Sri Lanka which is highly valued for its nutritional value. Garden Talk speaks to Deputy Provincial Director of Agriculture, District Agriculture Instructor K.N.K Jayathilake, about this leafy vegetable , a must have when it comes to a well- balanced meal.
“Vegetables are an important part of a daily meal. It is important for a person to consume at least 200g – 250g of vegetables daily. These Leafy vegetables have a high concentration of Vitamins such as Vitamin A and C. When you take leafy vegetables it comes in many varieties and is diverse. They are healthy and nutritious. From this Gotukola is one of the most important,” said Jayathilake

Gotukola has been part of Sri Lankan cuisine throughout its history and is a part of the food tradition. It is one of the most popular vegetables when it comes to Sri Lankan food.
“It has Ayurvedic properties and is immensely valuable in that respect. When it comes to nutrition it is a vegetable that is indispensable when it comes to our health,” stated Jayathilake
“When it comes to leafy vegetables Gotukola has the highest iron concentration. Iron is an important protein that is essential to the human body and Gotukola can deliver this protein. That is why it is highly recommended that we grow Gotukola in our garden,” pointed out Jayathilake
Gotukola grows in two ways – Bush and Creepers.
“A bush contains 100 – 150 plants. Once one plant is planted it creates a whole bunch of plants creating a bush. Then there is the creeper variety. This variety grows like a creeper on the ground parallel to the ground. It is not vertical. It is horizontal. There are nodes in these creepers and from those nodes plants and roots appear,” explained Jayathilake
Jayathilake pointed out that some Gotukola plants have large leaves. These can be seen in Creeper plants, producing a good harvest. There are also Gotukola plants with medium sized leaves. They are called “Meerigama”. This is because they are commonly seen in Meerigama.
“Meerigama is also seen in Creeper varieties. It can be exported and the taste is very good. The quality is very good. There is also another Gotukola plant with small leaves. This is Wel- Gotukola. This too grows as a creeper,” said Jayathilake.
Jayathilake stated that Wel-Gotukola is normally grown in low lands. But there should be a good drainage system. It can be grown in Coconut and Banana plantations as an intercrop. This is done to make maximum use of the soil. So while awaiting the harvest of Bananas if you grow Gotukola in the spaces in-between you can get an added income.
“It is important to select plant material that are not affected by Nematodes that cause the plant to become deformed, stunting the growth and causing the leaves to become yellow. They attack the roots causing the roots to swell up,” warned Jayathilake.
CLIMATIC CONDITIONS
FOR GOTUKOLA
· Most suitable to the wet zone.
· Rainfall should be spread out over the land
· PH should be 6.0 – 7.0
· The soil should have a good drainage system
· Before planting organic manure (cow dung, poultry manure, compost) must be added to the soil and water must be administered by the hose after planting to prevent plants drying up.
· If the heat is too much coconut leaves can be used over the plants
“When growing bush plants the distance between two plants should be 20cm. When growing creepers it should be 15cm. After planting the plants grow naturally. In 100 square meters you can grow 9000 – 10,000 creeper plants. In 100 square meters you can grow 5000 – 7500 bush plants,” informed Jayathilake
