‘Thirasara Lanka’ to usher sustainable development: Rathana Thera: From today to April 4 BMICH

The ‘Thirasara Lanka’ national programme could be interpreted as a referendum to identify the public’s view on leading the country towards sustainable development, Presidential Adviser Ven. Athuraliye Rathana Thera said.
Addressing the media at the BMICH yesterday, Ven. Rathana Thera said the ‘Thirasara Lanka’ national programme organised by the Presidential Secretariat Office jointly with the Strategic Enterprise Management Agency (SEMA) will be conducted at the BMICH from today to April 4 under the patronage of President Maithripala Sirisena.
The programme will be conducted in line with the sustainable development goals declared by the United Nations (UN) and ‘Wasa Wisa Nethi Ratak’ national programme.
The UN sustainable development goals covered by the programme will be a world without poor, toxin free food, a healthy populace, an educated moral society, an equitable place for women, clean drinking water, green energy, green jobs for all, sustainable industries, a just society, sustainable cities and communities, conscious consumers, a path to protecting the climate, a toxin free ocean, equity for all life, peace, justice and strong institutions and partnerships for the goals, the Thera said.
He said days from today to April 4 would be themed as a quality life, sustainable livelihoods, a space for the environment, a sound foundation and a quality society. The Thera said happiness could only be attained through achieving sustainable development. SEMA Chairman Ashoka Abeygunawardhena said around 1,000 stalls will be established for the national programme.
