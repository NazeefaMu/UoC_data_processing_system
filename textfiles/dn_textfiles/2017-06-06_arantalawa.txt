Arantalawa

The horrendous massacre of a group of novice Bikkhus at Arantalawa by the LTTE exactly three decades ago has all but faded from the memory of the local populous in typical Sri Lankan fashion. Over 30 Samaneras were brutally hacked and butchered to death by a band of blood thirsty terrorists while travelling in a bus to partake of a dana at another temple.
Former civil servant Austin Fernando now Governor of the Eastern Province who was called upon to deal with the disturbing aftermath of the gruesome episode recounted his experience in an article in an English daily on Friday (June 2) to mark 30 years of the tragedy. In chilling detail he recounted the horror he encountered at the scene where the bodies were laid out and how he only barely succeeded in preventing the inevitable backlash on the Tamils living in the Ampara town.
This perhaps was the single incident anywhere in the world in known history where members of the clergy were singled out for massacre and in such bestial manner (some of the novice monks were as young as 8 years). There was no international outcry at the time against this mind boggling crime while human rights organisations such as Amnesty International were conspicuous by their silence. Worse, the self appointed local patriots who now make a big hue and cry about the arrest of Buddhist monks did not so much as care to commemorate the 25th ‘anniversary’ of the Arantalwa massacre at a time the great patriot of them all was at the helm of affairs. On the contrary, the individual whose hands were bloodied by the mass massacre of Buddhist monks was rewarded with ministerial office and made a vice president of the political party of the great patriot .What is more, this worthy was seen at the Galle Face May Day rally the other day singing the praises of his benefactor.
It is not the just the monks. Innocent villagers, who formed a ‘buffer’ against the rest were mercilessly butchered with even pregnant mothers, and suckling infants not spared. Like Governor Fernando said only a very few ventured out to these vulnerable villages to provide solace to these hapless beings who were sitting ducks to terror strikes, among them Ravi Jayewardene, S.L. Gunasekera, Dr. A.T. Ariyaratne. One cannot recall any member of the National Movement Against Terrorism (NMAT) who are today holding media conferences ad nauseam on alleged unpatriotic and “unBudhhist” acts of the government ever going to the assistance of these villagers at their time of peril. Where were the likes of Dr. Gunadasa Amarasekera when the Sri Dalada Maligawa was bombed and why was no investigation demanded into the Arantalawa massacre and the gunning down in cold blood 600 policemen in the East? Was it because those responsible for these acts were in the bosom of their leader? Why are people like Udaya Gammanpila and Wimal Weerawansa silent on Arantalawa? They certainly could have made ample political capital out of the massacre of the Buddhist monks with the incident taking place under a UNP government. Were they embarrassed to rake up the matter for obvious reasons?
True, reconciliation demands the burying of the past and starting anew. But it must also be ensured that whatever mechanism that is being contemplated in regard to transitional justice and reparation, the above atrocities committed by the LTTE too be taken into account. A “Truth Commission” has to be just that. Laying down things just as they happened. There cannot be one way traffic. The crimes committed by both sides should be documented and the truth arrived at if justice is to be meted out in an even handed manner.
President Sirisena’s attendance at the Arantalawa Memorial to pay tribute to the slain monks at the 30th year commemoration of Arantalawa is a clear indication that although there is a will to forgive in the name of reconciliation there is no way such atrocities could be forgotten.
The best and the worst
The flood disaster and its aftermath, while no doubt bringing the best out of most Sri Lankans who rushed to the assistance of victims have also exposed the other side of the picture where elements bent on exploiting the situation are making hay. We say this because in most areas today, flood relief collecting centres have mushroomed overnight with some even erecting make shift shelters in street corners “to collect flood relief”. Of course one could argue that anything will be welcome at present to alleviate the condition of the victims, whatever the means adopted, given the gravity of the situation. It could also be said that not all these “collecting centres” are phony and that the relief collected will go to the right destinations. However the public cannot be faulted for entertaining suspicions, given the past experience where relief collected at times of national calamities found their way to the homes of the collectors which even included local politicians. Hence steps should be taken by the authorities to look into this aspect.
