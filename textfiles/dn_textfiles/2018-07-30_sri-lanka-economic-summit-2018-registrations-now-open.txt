Sri Lanka Economic Summit 2018 Registrations now open

The country’s foremost economic event – Sri Lanka Economic Summit 2018 will be held for the 18th time on the theme, ‘On the Fast Track to a Turnaround”.
This event organized by the Ceylon Chamber of Commerce, is to take place on September 13 – 14, 2018 at Cinnamon Grand Colombo.
Sri Lanka’s economy is once again at a crucial juncture in need of a swift and well strategized turnaround to bring about economic stability and development. This is in the backdrop of domestic and global concerns that can affect Sri Lanka’s businesses.
The sessions are designed on understanding the need for a turnaround, how it can be achieved and accelerating future outcomes related to trade, investment and services.
The latter session will build on some of the developments over the last 12 months with the signing of the Singapore- Sri Lanka FTA, launching of initiatives such as the National Export Strategy, Single Window Investment Facilitation Task force (SWIFT) and the Trade Information Portal.
There will also be a knowledge sharing session on Sri Lanka INC; transforming into the digital economy which will look at both powerhouses and new business models in the digital era, discussing challenges and opportunities. As such, the summit will provide a learning platform to hear from successful companies with takeaways for implementation in your organization.
The summit will also have a session to explore ways of steering the bureaucracy to work more effectively, thus meeting the emerging challenges. There will be a joint chamber plenary which brings together different Chambers in Sri Lanka to address some of the common issues impacting their members, and rectifying issues with policy adjustments, and deliberating on a common national agenda.
The summit will conclude with a presentation on the findings of the summit with a high-level panel discussion on how to build on findings and carry Sri Lanka’s economy to greater heights, in effort of fulfilling its potential as a remarkable global trade hub.
The two-day summit will be a wholesome opportunity to learn about government plans to develop the Sri Lankan economy (as well as the progress in implementation of plans), to improve business through knowledge enhancement pertaining to relevant sectors, to identify potential sectors and projects for investment in Sri Lanka, to clarify concerns with key government officials/industry leaders, and also to meet and network.
