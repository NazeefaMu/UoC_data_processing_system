School buses, vans allowed to use priority bus lanes

Buses and vans transporting schoolchildren could use priority bus lanes introduced to reduce traffic congestion in Colombo with effect from today, Megapolis and Western Development Ministry said.
Schools for the third term will start today following August holidays.
Recently the Government successfully introduced a separate lane for buses with other motorists being advised to desist from driving in the bus lanes during rush hours.
After successful implementation of a priority bus lane to reduce traffic congestion at Rajagiriya, the initiative later spread to several other areas of Colombo and suburbs.
