Vasantha Gamage succumbs to sudden heart attack

Former Embilipitiya Pradeshiya Sabha Member Vasantha Gamage (38) died of a heart attack on Monday, shortly after making the welcome speech at a meeting organized by the newly formed Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna at a hotel in Udawalawe. Gamage fell ill when leaving the hotel to attend another meeting organized by members of the Joint Opposition and the newly formed Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna, a party under the Chairmanship of former minister G.L. Peiris. Gamage had been rushed to the Embilipitiya hospital but had been pronounced dead upon admittance.
The meeting reportedly had been held to recruit members to the SLPP.
It had been attended by former minister Pavithra Wanniarachchi and Ranjith Zoysa.
Gamage leaves his wife and four children. His remains will be placed at his residence in Nindagam Pelessa in Embilipitiya and the funeral will take place at the family burial grounds on August 31.
