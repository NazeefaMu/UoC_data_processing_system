‘Markets not  significantly dented’

The Colombo Bourse saw the secondary market yield curve shifting slightly upwards with ultra-thin volumes as market participants continued to remain on the sideline. The emergency regulations have been promulgated in Sri Lanka after 7 years. Despite this, the markets were not significantly dented-in fact, foreign purchases almost doubled on 7 March, according to a market analyst. Compared to March 6, ASPI has declined yesterday (7) only by 29.6 points to 6503.86. The S&P SL index 20 too showed almost similar decline and not more--a decline of only 29.56 points to 3681.26. “Foreign purchases have almost doubled on 7 March to 101 Million shares from the 55.5 million of 6th March. Foreign sales, at 27.5 million on 6 March strongly increased to 66.88 million on 7 March. The 4464 trades on 6 March increased to 4714 on 7th.” Of this, foreign trades declined but domestic trades increased on 7 March to 4443.
