Lankan music lovers get once in a lifetime opportunity

The 59th Annual Grammy Awards will soon get underway in LA and two lucky HSBC Premier Customers together with their companions will make their way down the red carpet alongside music’s biggest stars.
Ranil De Silva and Shalika Samayadasa will both get the chance to experience a once in a lifetime opportunity, with complimentary VIP tickets to an awe-inspiring night at the Staples Center in Los Angeles on February 12. This will be further complemented with business class airfares and hotel accommodation, as well as receive a complete makeover to dazzle with the stars, all made possible by Mastercard - 'Priceless Surprises'.
Being overjoyed on hearing the news of winning, Ranil De Silva, said “Going to the Grammy’s is definitely a once in a lifetime opportunity. As a keen follower of music, I love traveling around the world to watch musical concerts. Winning this opportunity to attend the Grammy’s is simply putting the icing on the cake. From the moment I heard about the promotion, I really wanted to win it, as it is something that would be very special for me. I am very grateful to HSBC Premier and Mastercard for making this once in a lifetime opportunity real.”
“I would like to thank HSBC Premier for giving me this opportunity to witness the GRAMMY Awards in LA. I am very excited and extremely happy to be able to see all the superstars in the international music industry and I am really looking forward to the event.” said Shalika Samayadasa.
The HSBC Premier and Mastercard promotion held from October 1 to December 31, 2016, was another initiative to support the personal economy of Premier customers who share a personal interest for lifestyle events both locally and globally.
HSBC Premier continues to support the personal economy of customers through events that encompass culinary, photography, fashion, lifestyle, sports and others that compliment life with new and exciting experiences.
