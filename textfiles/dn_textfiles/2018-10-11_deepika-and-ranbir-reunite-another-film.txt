Deepika  and  Ranbir to reunite for  another film?

The dazzling duo, Ranbir Kapoor and Deepika Padukone is loved by the audience. Every film they do together ends up being remembered for their fabulous performances. Though they were once in a relationship, the two continue to be friends.
It has been three years since ‘Tamasha’ released, which was their last project together. But, now the hot onscreen couple will apparently reunite for another project.
Reportedly, Ranbir is already on board for the project, which is Luv Ranjan’s next. It also stars Ajay Devgn and Tabu. Latest reports suggest that Deepika is showing a keen interest in taking it up.
A source told a leading daily, “Deepika just heard the synopsis. Nothing is finalised till now. But it’s an exciting project and the fact that she has shown interest is a good sign.”
Hopefully, we’ll get to see their crackling chemistry on screen once again playing different characters yet recreating that infectious vibe. Ranbir and Deepika recently also met at the former’s residence along with a few of other friends from the industry including their respective partners Alia Bhatt and Ranveer Singh.
