NFF never a part of UPFA: Dayasiri

The National Freedom Front (NFF) of MP Wimal Weerawansa was never a part of the UPFA, said SLFP MP and Sports Minister Dayasiri Jayasekara yesterday as he explained that the Alliance had no agreement with the party.
Addressing a media briefing at SLFP Headquarters on Darley Road, the minister explained that only three main parties had official agreements with the UPFA. They were the Mahajana Eksath Peramuna (MEP) of Dinesh Gunawardena, Ceylon Worker’s Congress (CWC) with Armugam Thondaman and the Desha Vimukthi Janatha Party.
“They cannot leave the UPFA if they were never a part of it,” stressed Jayasekara and added that the five members of NFF simply contested as independent UPFA candidates and not as a separate party.
“If they are to be independent, they have to do what UPFA MP Chandrasiri Gajadeera did; be an independent UPFA MP within Parliament and not as a separate party,” he explained.
According to Jayasekara, Weerawansa had taken such a decision as he was not being given due prominence to speak in Parliament as a party leader under Parliamentary Standing Orders 23/2. “We have so many party leaders now that he doesn’t get to speak much. I suspect that’s the reason,” he said.
With MP Weerawansa deciding to be independent, Jayasekara pointed out that he would simply now be considered as any other member and be sent to the backbenches of Parliament.
The SLFP Minister said Weerawansa and his four supporters needed to also formally write to UPFA General Secretary Mahinda Amaraweera to declare that they would sit independently in Parliament. “They cannot say that to the Speaker. It is the UPFA General Secretary that they need to write to,” said Jayasekara.
On Wednesday, Weerawansa and four others from the NFF declared that they would sit independently of the UPFA and asked that the Speaker recognize them as an independent party in Parliament.
