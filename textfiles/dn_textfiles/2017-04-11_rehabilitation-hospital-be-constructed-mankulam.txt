Rehabilitation hospital to be constructed at Mankulam

A new rehabilitation hospital will be constructed at Mankulam in Vanni to rehabilitate around 45,000 disabled persons living in Vanni, Health Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne said.
According to Minister Senaratne, there are around 1,600 kidney patients in Vavuniya and 60 percent of them are from the Southern part of Vavuniya. During the previous regime, people had been re-settled in Mamaduwa in Vavuniya without providing them basic facilities.
He was addressing the gathering after opening the newly constructed kidney care centre at Mamaduwa recently.
Dr. Senaratne pointed out that the Northern Province Health Minister made a request to develop health facilities in the area. Sri Lanka was destroyed due to racism and the war was a temporary solution. The good governance government will ensure the rights of all.
When all required facilities are provided for the disabled, they will understand the bitterness of war. The rehabilitation hospital is to be built with the support of the Northern Provincial Council. A research centre will be constructed with the assistance of the European Union (EU) to find out the reason for the Chronic Kidney Disease of Unknown Origin (CKDU). When the reason is revealed, it will be much easier to treat the patients, he added.
