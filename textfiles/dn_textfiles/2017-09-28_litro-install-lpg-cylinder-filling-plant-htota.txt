Litro to install LPG cylinder-filling plant in H'tota

The national liquid petroleum gas (LPG) provider, Litro Gas, is to install a LPG cylinder-filling plant at its LPG Tank complex in Hambantota.
Cabinet this week granted approval for Litro Gas to go ahead with the project and award the contract to Dockyard General Engineering Services (Pvt) Ltd. at a cost of Rs 647.2 million.
The decision to build the plant was made on the justification that it would be an efficient way to fully utilize the 3,000 MT Tank Farm complex while also being able to provide easy distribution to customers in the districts of Hambantota, Ampara, Monaragala, Batticaloa, Matara and Ratnapura. Litro also has an 8,000 MT import and storage facility in Kerawalapitiya.
