Fifth and final ODI at Sharjah today
Lanka hopes to avoid whitewash by arresting run famine

SHARJAH, Sunday:<U+0B9A> Sri Lanka will attempt to arrest the run famine by their batsmen that has placed them in a position for another 5-0 whitewash of a one-day series when they face Pakistan in the fifth and final match at the Sharjah Cricket Stadium on Monday.
The failure of the batsmen to regulate the strike constantly and build up partnerships has been the biggest problem facing Sri Lanka in the second shortest format and seen them commit the cardinal sin (in ODI cricket) of not lasting their quota of fifty overs.
“It is pretty obvious. It is not rocket science. We just want the batters to be a little more positive about the way they go about things. We also understand we need to be in the right mental frame of mind to be there. So our job is to try and give the players the freedom to be able to play their way,” said interim head coach Nic Pothas as the pre-match press conference.
“It is going to be a very good wicket again and it is not the biggest boundary in the world. So we are always looking to just improving. From the batting point of view there’s nothing different to what we have been saying all along. Batters always play better when it is positive. Their decision making is better, feet movement will be better and there will be intent to score if you stay in a positive mind. It has been the same message all the way through. Execution is the toughest part so hopefully we can go and execute that a little bit better,” he said.
In each of the previous four ODIs only one batsman has stood out alone with no support from the rest of the batters. In the first and fourth ODIs it was Lahiru Thirimanne who scored a fifty apiece and in the second and third ODIs skipper Upul Tharanga with a century and a half century. The rest of the batsmen have hardly done any justice to their positions although the line up consists of potential scorers like Dinesh Chandimal the Test captain, Niroshan Dickwella and Kusal Mendis who has lost his place in the side to newcomer Sadeera Samarawickrama.
“It is disappointing but we are also playing a different Pakistan team. You have to take that into account. Their Test squad is in transition as they lost three legends of the game. We certainly know what that feels like,” said Pothas.
“We are building a Test team so we are very happy with the result of the Test team but the One day team - the Pakistan team are Champions trophy winners, they are on a roll. They are playing good one-day cricket and they got their formula down. So they can wake up at 3’o clock in the morning and their team and go and execute their roles and execute their skills. They are in a very good place. We probably know we are in different place. As much as it is disappointing it is also unstable.
“I don’t think we can call this a young team. We have some very senior guys in the side who have handled a lot of one-day cricket. It is a tough chance to go back and reflect on the last two ODI series the Indian one and this one here. When you keep losing something has to change,” he said.
Pothas agreed with Pakistan captain Sarfraz Ahmed’s view that Pakistan has the best bowling attack in the world.
“Hundred per cent I agree with that. As I say you can put new guys on the field and they know what they are doing. When a team is winning, it’s pretty easy to bring new players into their team because there is a good culture, there is a confident culture,” said Pothas.
“It is pretty easy to just drop people into that kind of environment. It is not easy when you are not winning. So they certainly do have one of the best bowling line-ups in the world. You can’t argue with results and argue with numbers.”
POTHAS JUSTIFIES DECISION TO SKIP LAHORE
Pothas said that his decision not to travel to Lahore for the third T20I against Pakistan was based on a family decision.
“It was a family decision. My family is not very happy about me going. For me my family comes first,” said Pothas. “Everyone gets a chance to make their own decisions. No one should be forced to do anything that they are not comfortable with. It was not an easy decision to make. It has to be respected,” he added.
“Some Pakistani media earlier today reminded me that several South Africans had gone to Lahore last month for the World XI games. It was their decision. Their decision doesn’t influence my decision. Ideally the Board wanted everyone to go. But no one pressurised me to do anything,” said Pothas.
Pothas, however, is expected to stay behind with the team for the first two T20Is in Abu Dhabi and someone within the coaching staff is expected to take charge for the final game.
Fast bowling coach Rumesh Ratnayake who had a brief stint as Sri Lanka’s head coach in 2011 and former captain and current batting coach Hashan Tillakaratne are the front runners for the post.
DISAPPOINTED IF WE DON’T WIN 5-0 - ARTHUR
Pakistan’s South African coach Mickey Arthur said that he would be disappointed if Pakistan didn’t make a clean 5-0 sweep of the series.
“The guys are hungry and the guys want to definitely do that,” said Arthur who is thrilled by the performance the Pakistani youngsters have come up with.
“When we are winning and winning well and we get a young guy who a year ago wasn’t in our team and is suddenly the No.1 bowler in the world (Hasan Ali) and also Babar Azam has moved to No. 4 in the world. (Mohammad) Hafeez has gone back to No.1 in the brisk form of the game. That is a great compliment to those players. That also shows we have started to gel as a really good one-day unit,” said Arthur.
The Pakistani coach expressed disappointment that Hafeez has been reported for his bowling action but was confident that he will come through.
“That is disappointing because he is such an integral part of this one-day side going forward in terms of what he brings with the ball particularly in these conditions. We spent the last couple of days going back on few videos and the stuff when he came back and we are confident that he is fine. I am pretty sure he is going get through that problem,” said Arthur.
