‘Mr. Chandramouli’ is special

It is a CEL release
Gautham Karthik, who has been facing a lot of flak for his appearance in a number of movies featuring adult content, including Hara Hara Mahadevaki and Iruttu Arayil Murattu Kutthu, has resolved not to be a part of such flicks any more.
Talking about his upcoming film Mr. Chandramouli, a commercial entertainer in which he shares screen space with his father, veteran actor Karthik, Gautham tells DC in an exclusive chat,“Mr. Chandramouli is a special movie because I have acted alongside my appa. When I was young, I studied at a convent in Ooty, and appa was busy with his films. I hardly ever met him all those years. It was only after my debut with Mani Ratnam sir’s Kadal that I started interacting with appa. Now, having shared screen space with him, I have learnt more about him — how creative he is, and the speed at which he comprehends things. It’s all thanks to my director Thiru and my producer Dhananjayan.” Deccan Chronicle
