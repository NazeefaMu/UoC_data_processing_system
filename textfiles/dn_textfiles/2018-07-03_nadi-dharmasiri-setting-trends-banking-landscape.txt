Nadi Dharmasiri setting trends in banking landscape

Sri Lankan marketing professionals are progressing along the right direction by reinventing themselves and the brands they manage to suit the changing times. The iconic status enjoyed by some of the country’s most respected brands and the entry of ever more international brands in to the market is a testament to this, says a senior marketing professional and current Head of Marketing, Sampath Bank, Nadi B. Dharmasiri.
“While Sri Lanka offers world-class marketing education, I believe we need greater focus on practice over theory, offering students more hands-on learning opportunities. We also need to go beyond core marketing principles and expose students to other disciplines such as finance and strategic planning. This will help us shape well-rounded marketing professionals who have an added edge when they enter the job market,” she said in an interview with the Daily News Business.
Excerpts;
1. Tell us about your current role:What do you enjoy most about your career?
I joined as the Head of Marketing at Sampath Bank, one of the leading national banks in the country, in July 2016. There is never a dull moment in this role. Given the level of disruption taking place in the financial services sector, both globally and locally, I encounter different sets of challenges every day. My marketing teamand I work with colleagues from across the bank as well as a host of other partners and stakeholdersto come up with fresh approaches to overcome them. Keeping me on my toes, it drives me to stay abreast of the changes happening in both financial services and marketing. This opportunity to continue to learn and grow is what I cherish the most about my career.
I also have held and currently hold few other voluntary and elected board positions during my career spanning 20+ years; the Chairperson of The CIM Sri Lanka Region in 2013/2014 being one of them; during which period the much-awaited constitutional revision and along with that the introduction of new business model took place.
Currently I am an elected member of the Board of Trustees of The Chartered Institute of Marketing UK, occupying one of the two international seats in the board room; responsible for governance of the Institute. The foreign exposure and decision making along with different cultural backgrounds poses a significant positive challenge and has addedcolour to my career over the years.
2. How challenging is this position - to be the Head of marketing of a local bank?
Sri Lanka’s financial services sector is intensely competitive and dynamic. All players are striving to gain an edge over the other by securing the first mover advantage. Despite being one of the relatively younger entities in this segment, having been founded in 1987, Sampath Bank has been the first to leverage severalemerging technologies to add greater value and convenienceto consumers and businesses whist setting trends in the banking landscape.Given this backdrop, we cannot afford to rest on our laurels but need to continue to keep up this pace of innovation. As the Head of Marketing, it is my responsibility to ensure that we engage the right target audiences on each of these innovative solutions with the right messaging.
3. As a person with wide experience in the marketing profession- how do you see the current trends in the industry?
Marketing communications, as a sector, has been one of the key drivers of disruption across industries around the world. And it is no different in Sri Lanka. While we are a developing market, itgives me pride to note that our marketing professionals continue todo groundbreaking work, especially on the newer media platforms. This has been aided in part by the country’s literacy as well as mobile and internet penetration levels. As digital and social mediums take center stage, we have more opportunities to engage larger audiences with tailored messaging much more efficiently and effectively at a lower cost vs cost of traditional media. This has also brought with it the need for brands and their custodians to stay alert, responding rapidly to evolving consumer preferences and sentiments.
4. Have Sri Lankan marketing professionals moved in the right direction?
I firmly believe that, while there is always room to learn, our marketing professionals are on par with, if not ahead of, our peers in the region. We are progressing along the right direction since we continue to reinvent ourselves and the brands we manage to suit the changing times. The iconic status enjoyed by some of the country’s most respected brands and the entry of ever more international brands in to the market is a testament to this. I am also delighted to note that a growing number of senior marketers in the country are getting actively involved in nurturing the next generation of talent.
5. How challenging is the marketing professionals’ role in an era run by millennial gen and social media?
The role of a marketing professional has always been challenging. The advent of the millennial consumer together with the rise of social media and globalization has brought an added set of opportunities and challenges with it. While the primary objective of engaging the consumer to create a positive impression about the brand remains, the way we need to go about it is different now. The freedom, convenience and speed to interact and express are much greater both positively and negatively.
6. How should the concepts be changed/and marketing education be changed?
Sri Lanka has always held the position of largest region outside UK for The Chartered Institute of Marketing, the most recognized global marketing qualification. While Sri Lanka offers world-class marketing education, I believe we need greater focus on practice over theory, offering students more hands-on learning opportunities. We also need to go beyond core marketing principles and expose students to other disciplines such as finance, strategic planning, etc. This will help us shape well-rounded marketing professionals who have an added edge when they enter the job market. I strongly believe that marketing should evolve to be a mandatory board position to drive the businesses forward in today’s challenging environment.
7. Tell us about some of your past experiences in the profession? Some of the best events in your profession?
I have had the opportunity to work in a diverse set of industries including advertising and communications, banking, insurance and finance, FMCG and telecommunications. My days in advertising have helped me gain a firm understanding ofthe requirements and constraints of both the brand and creative teams. This continues to help me in my work relationships with our creative partners, allowing me to comprehend genuine issues and limitations. I have also had the privilege of steering the marketing team that helped build Asian Alliance Insurance to one of the most respected insurance brands in the country at the time I exited the insurance industry. During my eight-year tenure with the company, the brand rose to become one of the top five most recalled brand names in insurance.
8. You have consistently been recognized as a top performer throughout your career. What is your personal key to success?
From a very early age I have been someone who will never give up. Whatever the task I set my mind to I have always strived to see it to fruition. Even when faced with seemingly unsurmountable hurdles, I have tried to find a way to reach my goals. And I have been blessed with family, friends, teachers, mentors and colleagues who continue to support me every step of the way. Above all I have a very strong will power coupled with divine guidance and intervention. I am who I am and what I am thanks to all this.
9. What are some of your personal and/or professional goals for the future?
On the professional front, while I would actively seek to learn and hone my own skills, I would like to share my accumulated learnings with the next generation and do my bit to groom marketers with integrity and commitment. Personally, I would like to be a responsible citizen of the nation, someone my parents can take pride in. Professionally I wish to secure a doctorate before I retire.
10. How do you like to see the next gen to take the marketing profession forward?
With the world in the palm of their hands, the current generation of digital natives has been very effective in learning about the world around them. However, they seem to be missing out on real world interactions. I firmly believe that as marketers, we need to be in touch with consumers, their pulse and society at large to be able to fully appreciate their needs and wants. Therefore, I would like to encourage the younger gento focus a bit more on real world engagements.
11. What are the best ways to get a job in the marketing field? How available are internships?
Young marketers need work on building a network of friends and mentors within the industry well before they hit the job market. In today’s world, paper qualifications are no longer sufficient to secure a job. Employers are looking for street smart, go getters who can do whatever it takes to achieve the task at hand; ability to work as a team player and adopt to prevailing organizational culture too are key. Internships are a great way to learn more about the ways of the industry while also proving one’s merits to prospective employers. And there are abundant internship opportunities available in the market for candidates with the right skills and mindset.Sampath Bank too has an internship program that continues to nurture thousands of young talents. My internship at Ceylon Tourist Board shadows me positively even to date.
12. What are some of the top challenges in facing marketing professionals over the next decade?
As with any other industry, we too need to embrace change and adapt ourselves to the new lines of thinking; primarily in today’s digital marketplace. We need to seek to disrupt the way we think and work or face the threat of being disrupted by new entrants.
