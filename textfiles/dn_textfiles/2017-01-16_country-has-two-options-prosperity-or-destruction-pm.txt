Country has two options, prosperity or destruction: PM

The country is now between two alternative options. One is to unite and follow the concept of the consensus government of good governance and work united until 2020 to achieve the prosperity of the country, and the other is to enter into old politics of discord and sabotage the whole mission and end up in disasters as a nation, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said in Galle.
He was addressing the concluding ceremony at Siridhamma Maha Vidyalaya of Nilamehevara Janapathy Janatha Sewaya national programme on Saturday. The programme was initiated under the patronage of President Maithripala Sirisena.
“We have to decide whether we continue with the same made-up development projects that the media displays or to engage in finding true solutions to the country problems and assure a sustainable future for the people. If we choose the second option, our country will prosper. People’s incomes will be raised. Education will be promoted. Good jobs will be created. We can step up to the world without fear,” he said.
If we follow the other way, he said, country’s debt burden will be amplified. We will fall into further trouble. We will have no good future. Poverty will be intensified. So we have to select one of the two paths. We have to face severe challenges as a nation. If we become united, we can march forward with confidence.
“When I arrived, I saw members of the two parties were present and collectively working towards one goal. I was delighted to see the unity and cooperation among them. They were prospective rival candidates at the forth coming Local Government, and Provincial Council elections.
They have no tug of war with their collective effort. In the past, we did not see such unity among politicians with different visions. Dividends of this harmony go to the public.
We have displayed that political accord of our two parties with the start of the third year of sustainable development of consensus government,” the Prime Minister said.
A new industry at Koggala FTZ was established and a new housing scheme in Hambantota was initiated. Last week the work on Ruhunu Economic Zone commenced. Foreign investment of Rs. 5000 million will be used for the economic zone.
The Galle district would be immensely benefited with it. Galle is between two zones where rapid industrialisation is taking place. On one side of it is the Colombo-Gampaha and Kaatunaayake industrial zone and on the other, is the Ruhunu Economic Zone. Hence Galle has a potential of emerging as a highly developed region, the Prime Minister said.
“We have selected one area of Galle for tourism promotion and a specific region had allocated for ICT development. We have a separate area as well for commercial housing. We will further develop the Koggala Free Trade Zone. We are going to start new industries at Charly Mount estate, he said.
The Prime Minister said more lands for cinnamon cultivation will be allocated and more higher educational institutions will be established in Galle.
“Minister Vajira is efficient and is supported by a clever Chief Minister. Minister Vajira with others’ support can develop Galle. We will make it the South Asian chief tourist destination, the Prime Minister said.
