‘Good Governance Government continues to uplift livelihoods’

The Good Governance Government had implemented many development projects to improve the livelihood of the underprivileged, All Ceylon Makkal Congress (ACMC) Deputy Leader and Parliamentarian M. H. M. Navavi said.
He made this statement while attending as the chief guest to a programme which was held to distribute equipment for self-employed residents in the Puttalam district, which was held at the Puttalam Divisional Secretariat auditorium, recently.
During the event, industrial goods valued at Rs. 2 million, which had been allocated by ACMC Leader and Commerce and Industries Minister Rishad Bathiudeen, were distributed among the participants.
Each beneficiary received equipment worth Rs. 50,000 under the said Diviyata Udana self-employment project.
Around 86 beneficiaries from the Puttalam, Kalpitiya, Mundal, Vanathavillu, Chilaw and Madampe divisions, participated in the programme.
Further, Parliamentarian Navavi said, "With the efforts of ACMC Leader Rishad Bathiudeen, the self-employed and underprivileged families within the Puttalam district currently receive aid to carry out their work. Last year, a sum of Rs. 50 million per head, was provided by the Commerce and Industries Ministry, which enabled the uplifting of many self-employed residents."
"This year, each parliamentarian had been provided with Rs. 2 million in order to meet the necessary requirements for such programmes," he added.
The Puttalam District Industrial Development Authority Deputy Director and Assistant Planning Director, ACMC Youth Organiser Iflal Ameen, Puttalam Urban Council members, the Kalpitiya Electorate ACMC organiser and others participated in the event.
