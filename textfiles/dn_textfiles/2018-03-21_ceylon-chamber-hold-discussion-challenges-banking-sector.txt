Ceylon Chamber to hold discussion on challenges in banking sector

“Overcoming the Regulatory and Compliance Challenges in the Banking Sector” will be the point of discussion at the latest Public – Private Policy Dialogue that is to take place on March 26 from 2.30pm to 5.00pm at the Ceylon Chamber of Commerce.(CCC)
The Public – Private Policy Dialogue of the Ceylon Chamber is a format in which it brings together its members and the relevant policy makers to have an open discussion, in being apprised of any issues the businesses may have.
This serves as a valuable opportunity for businesses to discuss with policy makers on the capital challenges for the sector, the changes on the IFRS Accounting Standards, the impact of Sri Lanka being labelled as a money laundering risk country, and the new forex act implementation.
The keynote address will be delivered by Reyaz Mihular, Managing Partner of KPMG Sri Lanka, and the panel discussion will be moderated by Rajendra Theagarajah, Chairman of the Ceylon Chamber of Commerce and Managing Director/Chief Executive Officer Cargills Bank.
Reyaz Mihular, Summaiya Macan Marker (Head of Compliance, Cargills Bank), Sanjiva Senanayake (Senior Director/Non-Executive Director, Sampath Bank PLC), Nandika Buddhipala (CFO, Commercial Bank of Ceylon PLC), and Yvette Fernando (Assistant Governor, Central Bank of Sri Lanka) constitute the panel for the discussion.
