Low income families refuse to move from shanties to apartments

The 500-unit condominium apartment complex in Angoda built for low income families in Colombo has been put up for sale as the families have refused to move from their shanties in Colombo to condominiums in Angoda.
The ‘Urban Regeneration Project’ under the Ministry of Megapolis and Western Development had proposed to build a five-storeyed condominium apartment complex on five acres in the Angoda Hospital premises. The Ministry had proposed this as a solution to remove undeserving settlements from the heart of Colombo.
The overall goal of the Urban Regeneration Project was to build 70,000 housing units to resettle the low income families.
The low income families, however, have stated that they were not willing to move to Angoda, given their children’s education, access to work and other amenities and facilities.
Megapolis and Western Development Minister Champika Ranawaka this week submitted a Cabinet proposal to sell these flats to members of the tri-forces, lower middle income government servants, artistes, small and medium scale businessmen, and women and civil activists.
