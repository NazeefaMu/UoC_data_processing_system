Team leaves for U19 Cricket World Cup to NZ:
Lanka determined to learn from past mistakes

The Sri Lanka team is determined to resolve their past mistakes and give a better performance in the ICC under 19 Youth World Cup which begins in New Zealand next month. The squad is grouped in Group D with Pakistan, Afghanistan and Ireland.
Their first encounter will be against Ireland on January 14.
The 15-member squad along with the standby players trained in Pallekelle throughout the ten days under the watchful eyes of head coach Roy Dias, a former Sri Lanka cricketer.
Sri Lanka have played against Afghanistan and Ireland in the Asian Cup recently and Dias said, “We are not fully aware of what may be the weaker and stronger points of both teams (Afghanistan and Ireland), but we have been observing via video analysis our mistakes when we were playing against the Pakistan side in the Asian Cup. We realize lack in batting depth but hope to display the right set of skills in the World Cup”
“Also being very supportive and motivating the players were Chaminda Vaas and Upul Chandana. With their help we are hoping to bring nothing but the best the players are willing to offer,” he said.
The coach also said that they had a well balanced side with ten batsmen including Jehan Daniel (all-rounder), six well trained fast bowlers three of whom are well recognized and two left-arm spinners in Praveen Jayawickrama and Hareen Buddhila who are in peak form.
The Lankan under 19 squad: Kamindu Mendis (captain), Dhananjaya Lakshan, Santhush Gunathilaka, Hasitha Boyagoda, Nawanidu Fernando, Nipun Dananjaya, Ashen Bandara, Kishan Sanjula, Nishan Madushka, Jehan Daniel, Praveen Jayawickrama, Haren Buddila, Thisaru Rashmika, Kalana Perera, Nipun Malinga.
