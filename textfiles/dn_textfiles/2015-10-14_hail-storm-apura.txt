Hail storm in A'pura

Ice particles fell in certain parts of Anuradhapura along with the heavy downpour experienced in the area on October 13. Ice cubes which fell in areas such as New town, Freeman Mawatha, Alankulama and Tissawewa were about 2 inches wide residents said.
Several areas were also water logged following the rain and the flood waters took about an hour to drain off. Branches of trees also had fallen in the heavy gale accompanying the rain blocking transport along certain roads.
