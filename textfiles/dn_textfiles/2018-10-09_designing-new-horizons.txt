Designing new horizons

House of Fashion has risen again. It is back! House of Fashion has been created in the image of what owners Preethi Jayawardena and Neela Jayawardena think fashion is. It has been made in the image of what these two owners want fashion to be. They cater to all forms of masculinity and what it means to be a woman in all forms. In addition to all of this they also cater to children. There was a time when House of Fashion Duplication road ceased to be. But there was a clamor for its return. And now it is back bigger and better!
Preethi and Neela Jayawardena are always concerned about this friendship they have their clients and their clients are their top priority. The clients comes first in their minds. They are extremely sensitive to the desires of their clients.
House of Fashion the trendy clothing store re-opened its branch at the original location in Bambalapitiya on September 29. The fashion store now opened for business at their store in No. 28, R. A. De Mel Mawatha (Duplication Road) is equipped with the latest trends in fashion in the world. The store is one of the largest such fashion stores to be operated in South Asia as a sole proprietorship, and is unchallenged leading clothing store in Sri Lanka.
At the opening there was a large number of customers and well-wishers and one had to push his or her way through the throng to see the opening of this fashion store.
Daily News spoke to Chief Operation Manager, Prabath Kulatunga, called House of Fashion the Home of Fashion!
“The Opening of House of Fashion was a humble request of our Sri Lankan customers. We also have a branch in Borella of considerable size which is bigger than the Duplication road branch. House of Fashion is always sensitive to how its clientele thinks and want. There has been a huge push by our clientele to re-open this branch. One reason why there are now VIPs is because the customers are our VIP! We want them at this opening because of the fond memories they have of us,” said Kulatunga
The first House of Fashion outlet was opened in Wellawatte around 27 years ago. And they have come a long way since those times when they operated in a location small in size.
“But because of our desire, dedication and discipline and our passion to serve our customers House of Fashion started to grow in size and popularity. As you can see from the crowd gathered here with or without advertising people, they have not forgotten us. After Wellawatte, House of Fashion moved to the Duplication road premises. We offer quality at reasonable prices,” said Kulatunga.
The vision of HOF is to give quality service to the customers.
“This branch was closed four and half years ago and now has been reopened because of popular request. Now in this reopened branch there are new variations. There is a lot of innovative and fashionable items.
There are different choices which will create more customer satisfaction. Earlier House of Fashion Duplication road was closed because we wanted to go to a better place. And that as Borella. Borella is running smoothly very well. But the customers implored us to reopen duplication road. We cannot ignore our customers.
Our clientele is local and foreign. The House of Fashion brand is known internationally. We are now going the extra mile,” explained Kulatunga.
