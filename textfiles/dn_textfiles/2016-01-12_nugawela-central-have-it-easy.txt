Nugawela Central have it easy

 
Nugawela Central College scored a 95 run win over Peradeniya Central College in their girls schools under 19 limited over cricket tournament match organised by the Sri Lanka Schools cricket Association and played at Nugawela Central grounds, Nugawela.
Nugawela's skipper Madara Samarakoon scored a hard hit 47 not out with 4 fours and 2 sixers and was unfortunate to miss a well deserved half century when they ran short of overs. She also bowled well to capture 2 for 6 and was well supported by skipper Piumi Somaratne who took 3 for 26.
Nugawela Central College - 147 for 3 wickets in 25 overs (Madara Samarakoon 47 not out, Piumi Somaratne 23, Tharushi Rajakaruna 23, Lakmali Rajapakse 26 not out).
Peradeniya Central College - 51 in 14.2 overs (Lakmali Wijeratne 16, Madara Samarakoon 2 for 6, Piumi Somaratne 3 for 26, Tharushi Rajapakse 2 for 8, Lakmali Rajapakse 2 for 9).
