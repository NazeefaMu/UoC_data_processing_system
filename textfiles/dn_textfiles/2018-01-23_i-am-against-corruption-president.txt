I am against corruption - President

President Maithripala Sirisena requested Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe to support him to bring culprits of the bond issue to book.
He was addressing a United People’s Freedom Alliance (UPFA) rally in Kandy on Tuesday.
The President said those members of the G L Peiris’ party were saying that the scam has happened from 2015 to 2016, but he knew what those members did then and asked the Premier and his party members not to weaken him in the move to take measures against those who had misappropriated public money.
President Sirisena said the G L Peiris’ party members should not forget that the Supreme Court judges had clearly stated in the report that the fraud had been committed since 2008. He said that a forensic and audit reports had been called for this reason. He said what is needed at the moment was to punish all those involved in the racket.
The President said it was fair to follow lions rather than leading a pack of dogs. He said all who defrauded public money should be penalised.
“That money should have been used to facilitate the poor. Although Mahinda Rajapaksa had requested people to join him as the government and opposition has proved a failure, he himself had failed at three occasions,” the President said.
He said Mahinda Rajapaksa held the Presidential Election two years earlier since he failed to run the economy. “He lost the election and the August election as well,” President Sirisena said.
“The people supported me against the corruption and I won on January 8,” the President said.
President Sirisena said Mahinda Rajapaksa did not vote for the no faith motion against Ravi Karunanayake brought by the Joint Opposition, but he congratulated Ravi when he won it.
