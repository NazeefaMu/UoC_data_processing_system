The Sports Law will be amended shortly according to the principles of the International Olympic Charter, Sports Minister Dayasiri Jayasekara said.
He was participating in the debate in Parliament yesterday on several regulations under the Sports Law. The minister said the Sports Law which is in force since 1973 would be revised in order to make it compatible with the basic principles laid out by the International Olympic Committee (IOC).
He said the draft amendments have been presently referred to the Attorney General and it would be presented in Parliament soon. He said the amendments have been necessary to prevent the risk of Sri Lanka getting disqualified to participate in the Olympics.
He said a special island wide test would be conducted to select 50,000 children who have talent in various sports to support them to improve their talents. He said the test would be carried out among 375,000 children.
“After selecting 50,000 children under 13 years, they would be grouped in zonal levels and given necessary assistance to improve their sporting activities” he said.
