Clossing date for Grade One application extended

The closing date for accepting applications for Grade One admission for 2018 has been extended until July 10 by the Education Ministry.
Considering many requests made by various parties and the consequences of the bad weather situation the country experienced a few weeks ago, the Education Ministry has extended the closing date. The parents sending their applications to schools by hand are requested to obtain a confirmation letter from principals of relevant schools.
