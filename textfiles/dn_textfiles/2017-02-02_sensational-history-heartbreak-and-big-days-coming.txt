Sensational history, heartbreak and the big days coming up

February is upon us and a glance or two at the Coliseum program in Rome would feature the Gauls at pains to defy, their rulers...and win their freedom throughout the empire - this weekend on the 5th day of February, traditional rivals invoke similar sensations as Kandy line up to defend their league title against the might of Havelocks under lights...On paper its a league match that will decide the champions 2017.
Blessings and considerations for all our resident experts, especially those who predicted and prognosticated a titanic clash for the crown.
I am equally impressed and sufficiently inspired by the script for this final, most significantly the current form of the key factors on both sides that will keep that scoreline ticking. Dulaj Perera, Sharo Fernando, Hirantha Perera, Muthuthantri, Rahul de Silva, Niroshan, Chamara Dabare, Kevin Dixon ...will certainly be contemplating how to dismantle Havies in the sets and in the loose.... They will want to strike faster to the breakdowns and focus on turnovers, causing as much disruption to Kandy having the slightest chance of clean ball to activate their threes. The plan would be for Muthu to antagonize his opposite number and hit that loose ball at pace ...rip their ball and hunt the shape all game tackling with force to knock the ball carrier behind his gain line each time the opportunity presents itself.
Kandy will present their calmest face but harbour a few shudders playing under lights in Colombo ...as the defending champions and given their second round consistency in winning all the battles, the odds favour them.
Roshan Weeraratne at the base, Fazil if fit, will be the critical combination to secure good direction and a steady ship all thru the 80 mins ...but vital support from Danushka Ranjan, Gayan Weeraratne, Richie Dharmapala, Nigel Ratwatte and Vishwamithra Jayasinghe both in attack is oxygen for their survival. Coach Sean needs to hype his forwards boiler house so they break the Havies pack, out scrum them, out think and out wrestle them as well, just to ensure a result they can celebrate. Shehan Pathirana, Soyuru Anthony and Udangamuwa will have to up their work rate and clatter into the Havies at each turn not letting them get their breath or settle under the floodlights.
I imagine a heap of percentage high balls, some rib bruising impact tackling to thrill the fans in their thousands, who will be screaming for justice after their trek from the hills to sea level oxygen in the city by the sea.
All in all a battle of epic proportion and much significance to energise the most sedate of citizens to adrenaline charged super-fan kitted up and ready to rock!
Equal the sensational line up on the 5th at Havelock Park is the RBS 6 Nations starting on the 4th, with England hosting the traditional channel partner France @ Twickenham. France will adopt a hungry wolves stance and hope to please their fans who make the short trip across the channel with heavy heats and extra plonck.
England vs France for very little ....else apart from wishes and a fabulously full house to absorb an injury riddled England against an unpredictable French team, whose exploits off the field have coloured ardent judgement for the clash.
Can Dylan Hartley see the sense in not becoming a mugger, retain his captaincy and last the pace after his red card ban?
Eddie Jones will be glum faced till the final whistle, knowing deep within the confines of his well travelled Aussie heart, that despite them being unbeaten in 2016..injury replacements are a shade shy on substitutes skill levels. how does one match the quality and impact of the Vunipolas and the Tuilangi, a Robshaw, and Haskell ...?
Jones will look to Farrell, Hartley, Launchbury, Itoje Youngs and Daley to secure the reputation and get past this first outing.
The schools season just weeks from kickoff and unprecedented anticipation bubbling over among parents, Old Boys Associations, players and schoolboys ....it's going to be an absolutely huge requirement to survive the intensity and injury, manage the kids performance levels right through...
Adrenaline weekends at home all around the Singer league families warming up for this complex season...
I trust the the Schools Association will spend their most attention and budget on educating the dangerous use of steroids, supplements, creatine etc....so parents, players, school staff etc...Doctor Seevali Jayasinghe, Director General WADA will be happy to help and update the anti doping list which is comprehensive and vital to athletes surviving longer than the trainers or tennis shoes.
Responsible adults need to police this and control the presence of these horrid individuals and their links to create dependency among our children.
It's February and the last post of January all done ...my task is to thank all the rugby hearts for their support and interest.
Thank you for the time spent strolling through my yards.. and the confidence to share my 'rugbyisms’ ...hoping it all goes well and results step up as predicted.
The time has flown with determined purpose ...lets hope the rugby weekend sensations, both here and in Europe, have equal pace on the wings.
Cheers islanders ....!
