ITAK marking time: Sangaree

Tamil United Liberation Front Leader V. Anandasangaree yesterday said Opposition Leader R. Sampanathan and the ITAK were not concerned about the situation of the Tamil people adding that they were just marking time.
Anandasangaree said Sampanthan convinced the Tamils as their saviour.
“But you have now left in the lurch both the Tamil people and the LTTE. They were made use of by you to enter Parliament," he said.
Anandasangaree said the Opposition Leader is ungratefully and unreasonably now demanding that the LTTE should be tried for their war crimes, when they should be treated as minors.
“I wish to remind you that the TULF took up the position that the LTTE cadres was made use of like weapons to fight the war which most of them joined innocently voluntarily and under compulsion," he said.
He was of the opinion that they should not be treated as conventional army.
Excerpts from the letter: "I am not at all interested in gaining power and position but only interested in finding early solutions for our ethnic problem and for some other complicated issues. As a first step I request you to drop the TNA garb that is causing much confusion, and come to the ring, with clean hands.
The TNA has lost its credibility due to frequent misuse of that term. It brought much luck to you and to some others but certainly not at all to the common people. They are now beginning to think that they are being cheated, after your admission to the media that the LTTE had nothing to do with the formation of the TNA. You are not unaware that the TNA was the creation of the TULF, of which you and I were Secretary General and President respectively. I alert you that the new development about the origin of the TNA, will cause damage to the very existence of the so called Good Governance.
It is a pity that you and the ITAK members of the Alliance are not taking seriously, the pathetic situation our poor people are facing and just marking time. You convinced the people that you are their saviors representing the LTTE but you have now left in the lurch both the Tamil people and the LTTE. They were made use of by you to enter Parliament. Now ungratefully and unreasonably you are demanding that the LTTE should be tried for their war crimes, when they should be treated as minors.
I wish to remind you that right from the beginning the TULF took up the position that the LTTE cadre was made use of like weapons to fight the war which most of them joined innocently, voluntarily and under compulsion. They should not be treated as a conventional army.
All these years the TULF was compelled to remain silent on some of these matters fearing repercussions from your group and to avoid getting branded as a traitor to the Tamil cause when in fact all 60 years of my political carrier was devoted for the welfare of our people and the country. Things are now going out of control.
The people who had full faith in you have lost their faith. The most honorable thing for you all to do, is to resign the membership of the ITAK members in the TNA, handover the TNA back to the TULF and to leave the issues facing the Tamils in the hands of the TULF that never failed in its duty to the Tamil people."
