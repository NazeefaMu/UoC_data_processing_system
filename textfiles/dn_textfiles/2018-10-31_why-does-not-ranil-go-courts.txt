Why does not Ranil go to Courts?

Why does not former Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe go before the Supreme Court if his removal is illegal, asked Pivithuru Hela Urumaya General Secretary and Parliamentarian Udaya Gammanpila yesterday.
The former Prime Minister and the United National Party (UNP) will not petition the Supreme Court because they know very well that removing the PM is legal and and in accordance with the Constitution, MP Gammanpila said.
Addressing a press conference held at the JHU headquarters in Colombo yesterday, he said only the Supreme Court has the power to interpret the constitution.
“Only the Supreme Court can interpret the constitution. But still no one has sought a ruling from the Supreme Court,” Gammanpila said.
Gammanpila said the former PM should follow the ‘comply and complain’ in the law.
He should comply and vacate Temple Trees after handing over all state properties and then leave and after that make a formal complaint to the Supreme Court. The Supreme Court accepts the Sinhala translation of the constitution as the final and not the English translation which is always used by the former PM, he said.
“If he does not like to go and file a plaint in the Supreme Court, he can get the signatures of 113 MPs and hand it over to the Speaker in order to table a no confidence motion against Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa and oust him,”he said.
The former ministers can enter their former offices during official working hours after informing the acting Secretary of the relevant Ministry and take their personal belongings back under the supervision of the acting Secretary.They cannot enter their former offices after hours informing the former secretaries of ministries like the former Petroleum Resources Development Minister did, he added.
