The benefits of playing in England

Touring is all about learning and educating oneself on the pitches, conditions and culture of the people in the country. It is an education in itself and there is no better place to learn them than in England.
Many past cricketers have confirmed that no international cricket career is complete without a tour of England.
So the 17 players selected to represent Sri Lanka in the three-match Test series of the upcoming tour to England should consider themselves lucky to be a part of that elite lot.
It is not everyone that gets a chance to be picked for a tour of England. There have been many international cricketers who have shone on the field but were extremely unlucky not to make a tour to England.
Why the experts insist that a tour of England is a must is because of the challenges it throws up for every batsman and bowler due to the constant change in the climate and subsequently the pitches.
In the subcontinent once you have got your ‘eye in’ and settled down you know the ball will not do anything unusual unless there is something wrong with the pitch. You can be certain that unless you make a mistake there is a hundred for yours for the taking. Similarly the bowlers know after a few overs how best to bowl on the surface and what it offers for them.
But in England even after you have settled in and have set yourself up for a hundred the next ball can either beat you or get you out. The batsmen could suddenly be wondering whether he has just walked into bat because even after spending hours in the middle and having got on top of the bowling you will still be open to the elements that could get you out.
That is why playing cricket in England is an education in itself because it teaches you to discipline yourself and test your concentration to the limit.
A good example of how a season in England could tighten your technique and make you a prolific run-getter is Aravinda de Silva, arguably the best batsman produced by Sri Lanka thus far.
De Silva had all shots in the book including the hook shot which one rarely sees batsmen play in modern day cricket. The problem with De Silva was his temperament and his shot selection. He was referred to as ‘Mad Max’ because he used to tear the bowlers to pieces in the initial part of his innings and then throw his wicket away when a hundred beckoned him.
A full season with English county side Kent made a world of difference to De Silva’s approach to the game. He had turned himself into a disciplined cricketer knowing which balls to hit and which balls to leave alone. Gone were those rash shots that had led to his downfall. The transformation in his batting was immense.
He scored 13 of his 20 Test centuries after his stint with Kent and that included two instances of scoring three consecutive centuries in a Test series against Pakistan and against India. He signed off his career with a double century against Bangladesh. However the high point of De Silva’s career was playing two classic knocks in the semi-final against India at Kolkata and in the final against Australia at Lahore that helped his country win the Cricket World Cup in 1996.
If you are a bowler the conditions and pitches teaches you how to swing the ball in the air and to get your line and length right, if not the batsmen could hurt you. It has always been advisable to bowl a fuller length in England where the bowler gets the opportunity to make the batsman to edge the ball into the slips cordon. English conditions have always encouraged swing bowling especially in the early part of the summer where Sri Lanka are touring.
At times even the England captain can get flummoxed by his own weather. In 1984 when Sri Lanka made their maiden Test appearance at Lord’s, David Gower, the English skipper called correctly and invited Sri Lanka, then the minnows of Test cricket to bat first.
Gower had his reasons for inserting the inexperienced opponents in for when he went out for the toss there was a heavy cloud cover that would encourage swing bowling and England had in their ranks the likes of Jonathan Agnew, Ian Botham, Richard Ellison and Paul Allott. But two days later Gower’s team was still on the field chasing down boundaries as Sri Lanka rattled up an impressive 491-7 declared.
Paul Downton the England wicket-keeper summed the situation up nicely when he said, “It was a classic London morning: overcast, a patchy forecast and the pitch looked a little green.
If things went right they could have been four or five down by lunchtime. But we were fooled by the conditions.
Literally as we walked out, the clouds parted and the sun shone. There was no swing and the ball wouldn't go past the bat.” The rest is history.
