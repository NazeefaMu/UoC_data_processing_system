World Bank’s Vice President reviews Sri Lanka’s reform agenda

Jan Walliser, the World Bank’s Vice President for Equitable Growth, Finance, and Institutions, arrived in Colombo on an official two-day visit. He gained understanding of Sri Lanka’s reform agenda, key to the country’s transition to upper-middle income status and to increasing its shared prosperity.
“Sri Lanka has made a commitment to implement comprehensive fiscal, economic and governance reforms. I look forward to my meetings with the government to understand how the World Bank Group can further strengthen its ongoing support for these initiatives, Walliser said.
Walliser also met senior government officials.
He said: “RTI law is a game changer in Sri Lanka’s path to prosperity if used with a focus on development effectiveness. It is a tool for all citizens – especially, the economically weak, the private/non-government sector and the media to play a key role in the decision making process of the public sector."
He reiterated the Bank’s commitment to support the implementation of the law together with other development partners and key stakeholders.
