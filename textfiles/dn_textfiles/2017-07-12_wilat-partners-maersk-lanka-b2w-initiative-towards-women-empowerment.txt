WiLAT partners with Maersk Lanka B2W initiative towards Women Empowerment

Maersk Line has initiated “Back2Work (B2W)” a career transition programme for women who have taken a career break of more than six months and wish to re-enter the professional work space.
After a successful round of discussions with Country Head, Maersk Sri Lanka Zeeshan Mukhi and Regional HR Team of Maersk, WiLAT SL and Maersk Sri Lanka agreed to partner on this great initiative to empower women.
Speaking of this partnership, WiLAT Sri Lanka Chairperson, Dhashma Karunaratne commended the B2W program of Maersk Group, which is designed with value drivers such as flexi-hours, refresher courses, mentoring, fair pay that enables women to overcome the hurdles that prevent them from re-entering the corporate world.
WiLAT SL is indeed encouraged by such initiatives that are developed with the underlying core belief that Gender diverse organisations surge in creativity, innovation and growth; resulting in Sustainable Growth.
