Adrift
Sea-worthy see!

Our union with her happens suddenly. The opening scenes link us with her trapped under debris. We need not be told what has struck. The torn mast sail and the rest of the ship wreckage say it all. A catastrophic event has happened, for sure. Hurricane? Probably. But we are not privy to the details yet. Not yet until we are more than halfway through the movie’s running time.
If Baltasar Kormakur’s ‘Adrift’ is ever to hold a special place in our hearts that should be because of his directorial excellence – of course, together with the dextrous cooperation of his cinematographer. Kormakur has no respect for (or maybe has no faith in) the established norms of filmmaking. He deconstructs the plot and gives prominence to the core theme – suffering, that is – over overreaching climax effect.
Where a conventional filmmaker or a movie buff would consider it most ideal to have the story flown from a proper beginning to an end, Kormakur harbours a different design. He thrusts the roles of the scriptwriter and his own to the dimness and pulls the cinematographer out into the daylight. And yes, Robert Richardson deserves mention in this essay for that matter.
Richardson’s distant shots of the yacht made small in the almost ripple-less aquamarine vast ocean recede the soul of the audience into a philosophical plain. He syringes new emotions to the true story that happened in Tami Oldham Ashcraft’s life. The vast blue ocean is not as sweet as it seems for a solitary female with no sign of human civilisation in sight. The frequent camera moves from distance in slightly different angles makes us not bored at all. Reminiscent of Vincent Van Gough’s ‘The Starry Night’ painting, the ocean shots surge emotions in the viewer. Those emotions may need fresh definitions.
‘Adrift’ belongs to the adventure genre. But it is not some childish cowboy type adventure, thankfully. It is the real-life adventure. Many reviewers of ‘Adrift’ make reference to ‘All Is Lost’ (2013). On the surface level, both films could be similar. But on a philosophical terrain, it bears more similarities with ‘Life of Pi’, where spirituality and the real-life adventure go hand in hand. Like Pi Patel, Tami Ashcraft (starred by Shailene Woodley) is a vegetarian. But how far can she sustain her philosophy – especially in the middle of a struggle for life in a 40-day expedition amid a yacht rubble? She finally swims down under the ocean to pierce a fish and eats it raw – an eerie scene even for non-vegetarian. Many more experiences of such weight are inevitable when you are struggling for life at sea for over a month.
The alternation between the past and present scenes is confusing. The story demands that confusion in order for the viewer to empathise with the core theme of the story. Halfway through, the genesis of the tragedy unravels.
Tami Oldham Ashcraft’s partner Richard Sharp is entrusted with a tempting job: taking a 44-foot yacht on a 4000-mile expedition from Tahiti to San Diego. The job is tempting because Sharp is a sailor and both are adventure-freaks. Everything is calm before the storm, the Hurricane Raymond taking charge of the yacht reducing it to almost debris. With Sharp washed overboard, the audience calls up for a moment how Tami was trying to rise over the wreckage in the opening sequence of scenes.
The love between them develops in the alternation of the scenes from past and present. The mutual interests nurture the love. So to say, we share her heartbreak and anguish over losing her fiancé. That figure – 41 days – is a go figure best believed in the widescreen plots centred on a sea adventure. But it is an actual figure. Tami Oldham Ashcraft actually struggled for survival for 41 days at sea. Kormakur’s film is an adaptation of her memoir: Red Sky in Mourning: A True Story of Love, Loss and Survival at Sea. In conventional terms, the closing scenes of the film recede into anti-climax. But then again, the story does not cry out for the climax. It is a story of true-to-life adventure, love and above all a titanic tragedy.
Could Tami actually save her partner? Or was it her hallucination, a probable condition caused by the tragedy? We are in the dark. But that is not important either. What matters most is that one courageous woman weathered a storm. She did that against all the odds, living off peanut butter and water running out fast!
Robert Richardson (cinematographer) and Shailene Woodley (Tami) together weave that epic poem of the 41-day tragedy. How could one woman survive for 41 days? Writing down the emotions is not that easy. Capturing it on the camera is even more difficult. Playing it out could be the toughest job.
Over the first 10 days, she had the physical courage to go through the trauma of her forehead bruise stitch. But that physical courage gradually ebbs away as food, dry clothes, usable water and other supplies run down. Her facial skin shrinks and once-rosy lips darken. She has to wear the same garment for days (sans upper undergarments) and given to nudity at one point. She runs into sudden hopes but very soon becomes a victim of dashed hopes. Worse still, she has to look after her partner whose leg injury may turn out to be lethal at some point. But her feelings for her partner are hardly a diminishing factor. The meagre leftover of food supplies, she feeds her partner (however hungry she looks in eyes) first.
Maybe you don’t want to read her story in black and white. Many viewers might not, after being made awaken to a widescreen ordeal. At any rate, ‘Adrift’ is a classic requiem for all what Tami Oldham Ashcraft underwent in 1983.
