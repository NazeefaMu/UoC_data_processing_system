Politicians should not denigrate Maha Sangha: President

Politicians should not disparage or blaspheme the most venerable Maha Sangha in making various statements on political, social or religious issues. Politicians should uphold the august dignity and veneration of the Maha Sangha, President Maithripala Sirisena said in Galle.
He was addressing a gathering that followed the religious events in inaugurating the golden fence around the Bo Tree abode and the unveiling of newly constructed 12-cubit Standing Buddha Statue at Dangedara Jayawardenaarama Ancient Temple in Galle on Sunday.
The religious festival was held under the patronage of the Maha Nayake of the Supreme Sangha Sabha of Sri Lanka Amarapura Maha Nikaya Most Venerable Kotogoda Dhammawasa Thera.
“Owing to some belligerent and pugnacious conduct of a few Bikkhus, no one should degrade the venerable Maha Sangha as a whole. I would never condone or encourage
such confrontational statements of some of our politicians and civilians,” the President said.
“I believe that our culture is more supreme than the law and the Constitution of the country. We have diverse cultures in our country. We have the Sri Lankan culture.
Then we have Sinhala, Tamil and Muslim cultures. In the same way, we can observe different provincial cultures.
The Northern Province culture is dissimilar to that of the Southern and the Central Province culture has different features in comparison to Western or North Central cultures and other provinces. Although our country is small geographically, it is a glorious nation gifted with rich and diverse cultures,” the President added.
“We have to study comprehensively and cautiously about the country’s past, present and future. In the study of our history, we can observe that it was a struggle-filled past. In any state we see various internal conflicts throughout their histories.
“Due to the geographical location of our country as an island, we have many advantages as well as disadvantages. Making the utmost use of the geography, we have to initiate new ventures, making use of potential for tourism, resources for agriculture and marine resources for the fishery industry. We can develop our country by improving our agriculture,” President Sirisena said.
“We have many social, political and economic problems in the country. The draught prevailed in five districts and a number of districts were severely affected with floods for over one and half years. Owing to these natural calamities, our agricultural output declined by 50 percent.
On the other hand a vast potion of our crops is destroyed by monkeys, apes and elephants. At a recent economic forum, the Kegalle District Secretary revealed that in the Kegalle district alone, over 75,000 monkeys threaten cultivations. We cannot advocate the killing of these wild animals as we are a Buddhist country. We have to consult the Wild Life Department and formulate a suitable scheme to address this wild animal menace,” the President said.
Various allegations are leveled against contemporary economic, social and political issues. Anyone can criticize our work and further, protest against the government. However, such moves should be taken after correctly analyzing the issues, he said.
Several Mahanayaka Theras including Most Venerable Kotuwegoda Dhammawasa Thera, Ven. Ittepane Dhammalankara Thera and Ven. Bellanwila Wimalarathana Nayaka Thera wrote to me recently about some vital issues including the long-standing Sangha Kathikavatha (Ecclesiastical Code). Our government on a number of occasions tried to rectify the issue.
We moved it in Parliament too. However, due to various obstacles, our effort became unproductive. I am greatly concerned about all matters raised by the Venerable Maha Sangha. I promise that I will fulfill all your sincere aspirations for the country, the President affirmed.
The importance and dignity of a person is measured by his deeds and behaviour in society.
The Buddhist ideology and tradition has guided us in this respect. Since the era of ancient kings, our Maha Sangha has led our nation in making it a glorious State. In the same manner, the Mahna Sangha has come to the rescue of our country at all times of national crises and foreign invasions. Hence, our veneration for the Maha Sangha remains in our hearts forever, the President said.
Amarapura Maha Nikaya Maha Nayaka Most Ven. Kotagoda Dhammawasa Thera delivered an anusasana while administrative Viharadhipathi of Dangedara Jayawardenaraamaya Ven. Pallawela Sumedhawansa Thera proposed the vote of thanks. Southern Province Governor Dr. Hema Kumara Nanayakkara also spoke. Southern Province Chief Minister Shan Wijayalal de Silva, and Ministers Wajira Abewardana, Gayantha Karunathilake, Chandima Weerakkodi, former Minister Anura Batian and Deputy Ministers Nishantha Muthettigama and Manusha Nanayakkara, Provincial Minister U. G. D. Ariyathilake, Galle District Parliamentarian Wijepala Hettiarachchi, Provincial Councillor Jayantha Jayaweera, politicians and others were present.
