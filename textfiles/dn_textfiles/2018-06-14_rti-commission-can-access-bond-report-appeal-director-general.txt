RTI Commission can access Bond Report  on appeal- Director General

 
The Right to Information (RTI) Commission can access the Bond Commission Report at the National Archives Department if it receives an appeal and determines whether it can be released or not, Commission’s Director General Piyathissa Ranasinghe said.
The DG was responding to a question by a journalist at a panel discussion organised by the USAID and Internews at the Lakshman Kadirgamar Institute in Colombo yesterday.
The DG said Secretary to the President Austin Fernando is bound to release the report sans any confidential information if an RTI application is filed. If such a request is denied, anybody can appeal to the Commission and the Commission has the power to open the report now with the Archives Department and determine whether it is of national importance and if so to release it.
The report at the Archives Department has an embargo for the next thirty years.
“You don’t have to wait 30 years to simply file an appeal,” Ranasinghe said.
