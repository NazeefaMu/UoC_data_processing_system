A Cabinet reshuffle was made to march forward as a country with new hopes and aspirations, President Maithripala Sirisena said yesterday.
Nine new ministers and one new state minister took oaths before him at the reshuffle held at the Presidential Secretariat yesterday. He requested ministers who took over the new ministries to dedicate themselves for the welfare of the country and nation.
President Maithripala Sirisena said that the Deputy Ministerial Portfolios and State Ministerial portfolios will also be changed in due course, Social Empowerment and Welfare Deputy Minister Ranjan Ramanayake said.
He told Daily News that the President also said that there will be a few changes of subjects coming under the Deputy Ministers.
 
“The President also said that the reshuffle does not imply that those ministers or the deputies’ had underperformed but it was aimed at more effective service to the public,” Deputy Minister Ramanayake added.
