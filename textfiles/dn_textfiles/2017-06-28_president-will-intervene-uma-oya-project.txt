President will intervene in Uma Oya project

President Maithripala Sirisena will meet the protestors of the Uma Oya Multipurpose Project on Friday evening, Digital Infrastructure Development Minister Harin Fernando said.
Addressing a press conference at his Ministry today, Fernando said the President has decided to intervene to resolve the problems faced by the people affected by the above project.
He said ten persons representing the protesting mass have been invited by the President for a discussion tomorrow.
He said a Norwegian company has been requested to look into the shortfalls of the Uma Oya project and propose solutions.
Observing that the public agitation over the project was fair, the Minister said the Government should be sensitive to the concerns raised.
“Many asked me why I did not join the public protest. As a public representative, I cannot go to them without a solution to the problem,” he said.
