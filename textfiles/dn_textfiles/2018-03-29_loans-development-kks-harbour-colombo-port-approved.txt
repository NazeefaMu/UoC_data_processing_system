The Government of India agreed to provide a line of credit amounting to US$ 45.27 million for financing the rehabilitation of the KKS Harbour, which is to be turned into a self-sustainable, commercial harbour, in line with the North East Economic Corridor concept.
The Sri Lanka Ports Authority (SLPA), will undertake the work and the new jetty along with the rehabilitation of the existing one is expected.
