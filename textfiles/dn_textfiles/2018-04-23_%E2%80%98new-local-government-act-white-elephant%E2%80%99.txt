‘New Local Government Act, a white elephant’

It is a crime that the number of councillors of local bodies countrywide, had increased unnecessarily by the recently-introduced Local Government Act. The Act is no doubt a white elephant, Ajith Wijewardena, a UNP councillor attached to the Polgahawela Pradeshiya Sabha of the Kurunegala district said.
He was addressing the pradehsiya sabha's inaugural meeting, recently.
A large sum of public funds are required to maintain these councillors. The government should take immediate steps to rectify this blunder as the country is already facing other hindrances such as the ones experienced with the economy. All politicians, government officials and party leaders are answerable for this plight, he added.
"Councillors, parliamentarians and ministers enjoy their large salaries and privileges at the expense of the public people; it is a burden especially to low-income families," Wijewardena said, adding that the population of the country is around 20 million, but that there are more than 8,000 councillors for local bodies alone.
