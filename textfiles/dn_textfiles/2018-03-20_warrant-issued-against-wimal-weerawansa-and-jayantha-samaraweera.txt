Warrant issued against Wimal Weerawansa and Jayantha Samaraweera

 
A warrant was issued against National Freedom Front (NFF) Leader Wimal Weerawansa and NFF General Secretary Jayantha Samaraweera by the Colombo Fort Chief Magistrate a short while ago.
The warrant was issued after they failed to appear before courts.
The two Parliamentarians were alleged to have initiated a protest against the arrival of Prince Al-Hussein to Sri Lanka in 2016, violating traffic laws at Bauddhaloka Mawatha, Colombo 7.
