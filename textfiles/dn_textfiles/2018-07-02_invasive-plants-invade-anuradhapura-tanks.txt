Invasive plants invade Anuradhapura tanks

Invasive aquatic plants have invaded major irrigation tanks and canals in the Anuradhapura District.
Nijas Marina, Japan Jabara, Salvinia, and Diya Habarala among others have spread in the Mahakanadarawa reservoir and Wildlife Conservation Officers are opposing any attempt taken by any other sources to remove the plants saying that such attempts would harm the wildlife and plants.
The Irrigation Department brought a German made high-tech machine valued at Rs. 57 million to remove the plants in the Mahakanadarawa tank but they cannot use it amidst the objection raised by the wildlife preservation officers.
Anuradhapura Government Agent R,M, Wanninayake said the Mahakanadarawa reservoir lies in the wildlife conservation reservation.
“I have requested the Wildlife Conservation Director General to grant the permission to remove invasive plants in the Mahakanadarawa tank,” Wanninayake said.
The Government Agent has submitted his request in writing on May 31 but he has not received a reply yet.
