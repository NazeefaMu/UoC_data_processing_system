SC notices on COPE members: Speaker’s ruling after studying legal background

Speaker Karu Jayasuriya yesterday said in Parliament that he would study the legal background and make an announcement over the Supreme Court notices sent to the COPE members.
JVP MP Bimal Rathnayake brought to the attention of the House that the COPE members who participated in the Treasury bonds investigations have received notices summoning them to court.
“I raise this issue on behalf of all COPE members. We in the COPE execute the duties of Parliament. If the court intervenes into our role in the COPE, then it is a breach of our Parliamentary privileges. The Speaker has to look into it. However, we are not afraid to go before any courts of law for our contributions in the investigations on the bond scam,” MP Rathnayake said.
Opposition MP Vasudeva Nanayakkara also urged the Speaker to give a clear ruling in this regard. “When an MP has been summoned to court as a respondent because of his role as a Parliamentarian should he comply with that? If not can we maintain the previous stance that the court cannot middle into the affairs coming under Parliament powers and privileges even in this instance? That is the problem before us,” he said.
Former President and MP Mahinda Rajapaksa said studying the previous ruling made by former Speaker Anura Bandaranaike at a similar instance in the past would be helpful for the Speaker to arrive at a decision in this regard.
The Speaker said that he would obtain legal advice and make an announcement in the House later.
