‘Govt. won’t privatise Mattala, but will make it a profit earning venture’

The government will not privatise the Mattala International Airport, but there is a burning need to convert it as a profit earning venture as it had already become a burden on the economy of the country, Transport and Civil Aviation Minister Nimal Siripala de Silva said.
The Minister said so, addressing a gathering at the Bandaranaike International Airport (BIA) yesterday after commissioning the renovated runway for 24 hour air traffic operations.
The Minister added that the country’s resources cannot be offered to other countries and it cannot be accepted.
Under the project, the runway has been relayed so as to meet international standards and moreover to handle all sizes of aircraft ever built in the world including A380 Airbus.
The rehabilitated runway, was opened yesterday at 12.37 p.m. with the arrival of a new SriLankan flight UL-1162 from Trivandrum.
“The construction of the overlay work commenced on schedule on January 6, 2017 and had been scheduled to be completed on April 6. The daunting task of operations during this period was managed while ensuring the right level of security and safety within the airport premises with the least hassle to the passengers, airlines and cargo operations. The rehabilitated runway is able to accommodate A380s Airbus as the width of the runway has been increased to 75 metres from 60 metres,” the Minister noted.
The Netherlands Airport Consultants (NACO) has carried out the design and supervision consultancy while the overlaying was carried out by a Chinese company named CATIC at a cost of Rs.7.2 billion.
Minister de Silva added that the officials of the International Civil Aviation Organisation recommended an overlaying of the runway to improve runway surface condition for safe operations of aircraft since no major rehabilitation work had been carried out on the runway after the airport was commissioned in 1985.
The runway of BIA is upgraded to modified Code ‘F’ compliance, aerodrome Ground Lighting of the Runway and Taxiway system of BIA upgraded to CAT II as per ICAO, all of the new installation will be energy efficiency LED Light system, surface movement guidance system to the Runway and taxiway systems, new airfield light control and monitoring system, all Runway markings as per ACI new addition, and capacity of Runway system will be enhanced to meet the next 20 year growth.
Addressing the gathering the minister said that yesterday was a red letter day in aviation history of the country as it is was a major step taken towards the aviation sector development.
Minister de Silva said that he joined this good governance government not to lick bones but to work for the country and the people.
