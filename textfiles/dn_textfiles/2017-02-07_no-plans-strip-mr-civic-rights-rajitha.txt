No plans to strip MR of civic rights: Rajitha

The government has not taken a decision to strip former President Mahinda Rajapaksa of his civil rights, Health Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne said.
According to the minister's media secretary, the minister had said rumours that circulate in connection with the topic has no base. He expressed those views during a meeting at the Health Ministry.
Minister Dr. Senaratne stated that the delay in conducting investigations on large scale corruptions such as the MiG deal, Dubai bank accounts and the Wasim Thajudeen murder is an issue. The government had been criticised for conducting investigations on minor issues, while ignoring the major ones. Some officials do not do their duty and the law cannot be implemented against them, he said.
“My son, MP Chathura Senaratne and I will extend our fullest support to the strike launched by the Manpower workers attached to Sri Lanka Telecom and will provide legal aid. It is because they dedicated themselves to create this good governance Government,” the minister said.
