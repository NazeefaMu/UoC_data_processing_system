Budgeting and Forecasting for  Non-Finance Managers  programme on August 1

Acclivity Training will carry out a one-day seminar on Budgeting and Forecasting for Non- Finance Managers on August 1, 2018 at Renuka City Hotel.
This seminar will not only cover the technical aspects of budgeting, required by non-finance managers, but will wrapped up with a discussion on the practical aspects of budgeting. Non- finance managers need to participate effectively in the decision-making process and recognise how their decisions and their business unit’s performance impact the performance of their organization.
In order to do so they need to understand the budgeting process. For this reason, Acclivity Training considers knowledge of budgeting essential for any manager who needs to manage a budget.
A spokesman for Acclivity Training said that the seminar will focus on budgeting skills and the elements of a budget. Participants will learn budgeting concepts, how to assess revenue and costs, forecasting techniques and justification of expenditure. The contents will be illustrated by a case study.
Upendra Wijesinghe, a well known speaker in the accounting field will lead the seminar. Wijesinghe is currently the Chief Executive of Excellence Business School and Managing Partner of W&J Associates. Lalith Yatiwella, Finance Director of Singer Sri Lanka PLC, will join in the discussion and share his practical experience.
