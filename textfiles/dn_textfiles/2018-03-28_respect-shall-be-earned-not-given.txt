Respect shall be earned, not given!

The Colombo Zonal Education Office has issued a letter instructing the school principals to invite MPs and Provincial Councillors to important school functions and to treat them with due respect. The Zonal Education Director is instructing the principals that it is the duty of any government official to respect politicians.
This letter is an insult to government servants.
That should not be the case.
Now the principals are instructed to invite politicians to attend school functions and treat them respectfully. This move only encourages, and motivates the politicians to interfere with school administration. They will try to control principal and staff. This will cause the quality of education to drop.
If a politician wants to approach the principal, there is an accepted protocol.
They have to consult the relevant director and then meet the principal. If all the politicians begin approaching the principal straight away, there will be confusion.
This letter aptly raises the question of the dignity and esteem of the state officials.
There is harassment already happening to teachers and principals on the part of certain politicians. The letter issued by the Colombo Zonal Education Office, no doubt, will make things worse paving the way for unwarranted political influence and interferences.
