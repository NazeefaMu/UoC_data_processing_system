Absence of SLC domestic inquiry rather intriguing – former SLC official

“Whilst we have all seen the ICC verdict on the ball tampering incident and with regards to the Spirit of Cricket that took place in the Caribbean last month, it is indeed intriguing to note that SLC has not initiated a domestic inquiry of its own to ascertain the facts of the case,” observed a former Sri Lanka Cricket official.
“The harshness of the punishment imposed by ICC only goes to show how seriously the International body has viewed the conduct of our team Management and the Captain. It will therefore be in the best interest of SLC’s future Cricket Management and the cricketers, if the SLC like in the case of Cricket Australia who initiated their own inquiry irrespective of
the ICC ruling, get to the bottom of why this should have taken place at all,” stated Nuski Mohamed, a former Sri Lanka Cricket secretary and treasurer. “Not so long ago in 2013, we were the recipient of the ICC Spirit of Cricket Award,” he noted and added: “A domestic inquiry is a sine qua non to incidents of this nature and magnitude. Let us hope that SLC even at this late stage will initiate an inquiry not only to implement the ICC punishment on the Cricket Management and Captain, but also to have their own findings on record.”
