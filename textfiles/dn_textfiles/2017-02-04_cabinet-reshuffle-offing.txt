Cabinet reshuffle in the offing

President will decide the date:
Section of public sees need for reshuffle:
A Cabinet reshuffle is in the offing but the date will depend on the President, Fisheries and Aquatic Resources Minister Mahinda Amaraweera said yesterday.
“There is a certain opinion among the public that there needs to be a Cabinet reshuffle. A similar view exists within the party,” Minister Amaraweera who also holds the position of UPFA General Secretary said. The minister was addressing a media briefing at the Fisheries and Aquatic Resources Ministry yesterday.
He however added that the government would not be toppled anytime soon. “It is a joke to think that a government can be toppled in two years,” he said even though this is the very claim the opposition continues to make.
“The opposition always protests. The people have become desensitised to it. When the UNP was in power, we would say that we were going to topple the government that year, but the UNP stayed in power for 17 years. When UNP was in opposition, they did the same but nothing happened for 20 years!” remarked Amaraweera.
“The Joint Opposition is trying to create a split within the SLFP and this has been blamed for the continued postponement of the Local Government elections.
“We are trying our best to unite the party but that does not mean that certain factions can take advantage of our good intentions. We need to conduct the Local Government elections soon. If a certain faction is trying to break away they can do so.We can then rebuild the party,”Amaraweera said when asked about the delay in elections.
In answer to reports that former President Mahinda Rajapaksa would contest through a separate party, he said, “if he goes out on his own, he will remain on his own.
No breakaway group has succeeded in history.They always return to the party in the end,”he said.
