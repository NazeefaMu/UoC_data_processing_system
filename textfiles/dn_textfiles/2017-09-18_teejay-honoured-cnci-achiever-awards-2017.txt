Teejay Lanka, a multinational textile manufacturer, was honoured at the recently concluded CNCI Achiever Awards 2017, organised by the Ceylon National Chamber of Industries. President Maithripala Sirisena was Chief Guest.
The company established its position among the Top 10 Corporates by winning the CNCI Top ten Special Achiever Award for industrial excellence and also became the National Level Bronze Award winner in the Extra-Large Category of the manufacturing sector.
These awards reinforce Teejay’s standing as one of the nation’s top corporate and business powerhouses of today and recognise continual achievements on both global and national platforms during past few years, in manufacturing and industrial excellence.

Commenting on the awards won, the company’s Chief Operating Officer Pubudu De Silva said, “These awards acknowledge Teejay’s contribution to the national economy and are a testament to our aspiration to become an innovative world-class knit fabric solutions provider in the region.
The performance of our employees, combined with our commitment to quality, speed, productivity and innovation have earned us these important accolades.”
Teejay is listed on the Colombo Stock Exchange and last year entered the S&P Top 20 Index in Sri Lanka.
The Company was also named among the Forbes “200 Best under a Billion in Asia.”
Teejay recently invested approximately US$ 15 million to double capacity in India in preparation for future growth through GSP and also invested in synthetic manufacture in Sri Lanka.
