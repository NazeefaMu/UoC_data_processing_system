Power of a speech

Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe has intervened to bring sense to the debate created by the recent speech of the President. One Maha Nayaka Thera has said it is very sensible the way Prime Minister advised his followers. The best possible response under the circumstances. Apparently he had told the party’s ministers and MPs not to respond to the President but should resolve the problems faced by the people.
As a liberal he is governed by empirical and pragmatic vision. One analyst said “That’s the wisdom of a man who understands the gravity of the situation faced by the Government and by his party. It is an acknowledgment of failure; he’s essentially saying “we haven’t solved the problems of the party and exchanging barbs with the President is not going to boost our chances at the next election.”
The problem is that Yahapalanaya has not satisfied the expectation of the people who put them to power. For that neither President nor Prime Minister can pass the buck to the other. In all this Prime Minister Wickremesinghe has more to lose than President Sirisena.
‘Sinhala Only’ agitation
Actually President Maithripala Sirisena made a fine speech. It was a surprise to many though it is not. I would say it is well prepared and it is well grinded populist speech. Sarcasm created is well in the tradition of Bandaranaike. SWRD also made such speeches suitable to the occasion. In that period, first he roused the crowd with ardent ‘Sinhala Only’ agitation, then truly to balance by defending devolution with sober thinking. That was after Bandaranaike-Chelva Pact.
100-Day Programme
Finally it was a failure; because his rule was discredited by the ’57 riots followed then by state repression. Thereafter, with the elapse of some tense period, Bandaranaike senior was knocked down by a monk who complained about Bandaranaike for his betrayal of ‘Sinhala Only’ promises. In his speech made recently the President said that he didn’t know who drafted the ‘100-Day Programme’. He, with a pleasant smile hinted that Ranil Wickremesinghe had without his knowledge, asked the Air Force Commander to release helicopters to transport Mahinda Rajapaksa (who had lost the presidential election the previous day) to Hambantota.
In that delivery President also made a stern comment on media responsibility, of course with a knowing humble smile. Again he surprised everybody a few days later by proclaiming that he would not hesitate to ban social media if there’s no self-regulation.
These statements raise interesting questions. He is in fact claiming that he was a presidential candidate, who participated in all discussions that took place with all Yahapalanaya -common front leaders, has no clue who drafted the key programmatic content of his manifesto. I can remember well, President Sirisena participating seriously in all discussions that concluded before elections.
Clearly it shows like SWRD, President Sirisena too wants to play a Bonapartist role by balancing above contending forces. Can this smaller actor compared to either Napoleon or Bismarck achieve more than Bandaranaike, to bypass both Rajapaksa and Wickremesinghe and resolve the Tamil national problem with the principal of equality alone?
On the other hand the statement regarding social media is not just a joke. The warning is directed at social media but it demonstrates scant regard for the freedom of expression and a willingness to throw babies along with the bathwater among other things. Of course it does not make him a sinister President, following the example of former President Mahinda Rajapaksa.
Yahapalanaya political campaign
In the midst of all this, President Sirisena, speaking at same speech commemorating the late Venerable Maduluwawe Sobitha Thera, said that the Venerable Thera had not wanted the Central Bank robbed, a clear reference to the Bond scam issue and another hint at the complicity of his Yahapalanaya partner, Ranil Wickremesinghe. This is very interesting. When they made accusations against Wickremesinghe in the first place, I said that if he has raised a fund by this means it should be for a valid political reason, hence he should be absolved as end justifies the means. Many contested this moral principle. Today it is exposed 118 politicians have been given money for the political campaign of Yahapalanaya against fascistic politics of the combine opposition. Unfortunately the setback of Yahapalanaya in the last local government shows that money has not been used properly, or money did not come in time.
