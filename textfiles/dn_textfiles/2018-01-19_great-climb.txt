The great Climb!

The “Climb Everest with Johann” Campaign was launched at the Hilton Colombo on January 17, 2018 and was graced by the Prime Minister, Ranil Wickremasinghe and Prof. Maithree Wickremasinghe.
Conquering Mount Everest is a dream of many but a feat completed by few. The accomplishment of this great challenge brings great prestige to those who succeed. Having reached the height of 8400m, a mere 448m shy of the peak, Johann Peries made the wise decision to turn back owing to a technical malfunction however nothing seems to be keeping this man down. Resilient, passionate and beaming with positivity, Johann Peries is ready to take a second crack at the great Everest and this time, every Sri Lankan can partake of the exertion.
The “Climb Everest with Johann” Campaign was launched on January 17 so that every Sri Lankan can be a part of his great journey. For Rs. 100/= every Sri Lankan can sponsor a step that Johann takes on his ascent and descent of Mount Everest. The total cost of the expedition amounts to USD 58,600 and all contributions made, go towards financing the journey and all the associated costs. Technically equipped and heart ablaze for the journey ahead Johann, who has been training since December 2016, is to commence his second attempt in April 2018.
Johann is no stranger to the tedious excursion ahead. In April 2016, Johan Peries and Jayanthi Kuru-Utumpala were the first Sri Lankans to attempt to summit the peak of 8,848m above sea level. Owing to a technical malfunction with his oxygen cylinder, Johann Peries was forced to refrain from proceeding to the peak and Jayanthi Kuru-Utumpala became the first Sri Lankan to scale the summit.
This time around Johann will not have the companionship of Jayanthi but he is by no means alone. He will be a part of a larger team led by International Mountain Guides (IMG), a globally renowned mountaineering company and will have the support of every Sri Lankan who wishes to share steps in his journey.
The website for this campaign is www.johanneverest2018.com and the trending hashtag via which to follow Johann’s journey is #climbeverestwithjohann
Jayanthi Kuru-Utumpala addressed the crowd describing the tremendous excursion undertaken by both her and Johann in 2016 explaining the misfortune faced by Johann at the malfunction of his oxygen cylinder and his wise decision to descend rather than risk his life any further. Detailing the gravity of the situation especially in the Death Zone area of Mount Everest, she described the harsh conditions that even resulted in the deterioration of their bodies. Explaining that she would not be accompanying Johann on his expedition, she wished him more and more strength and courage, hoping that he would finally be able to fulfil his dream and finish what he started. She would remain with him in spirit and support him from Colombo – her base camp.
Johann Peries then addressed the press and guests regarding his decision to reattempt the conquering of Mount Everest. Explaining that he was filled with a multitude of sentiments as he set about fulfilling his goal and finishing what he started. More than anything else he emphasized the strength he draws from his spiritual beliefs and is confident that this time he will succeed. Laughing he assured his audience that he would continue to make the right decisions. Thanking the press for their continued support, he urged the public to join him on his expedition. He then invited the Prime Minister, Ranil Wickremasinghe to sponsor his first step.
The Prime Minister, Ranil Wickremasinghe placed a pin at the top of the picture of Mount Everest to symbolize his donation and then addressed the gathering. He explained that he had position his pin at the peak in the hopes that Johann will get to the top this time round. Laughingly he asked Johann, “Why on earth would you want to do it again?” He encouraged Johann to overcome the challenge and urged him to become the 2nd Sri Lankan to conquer Mount Everest and make it to the top. Professor Maithree Wickremasinghe too made a donation and placed a pin at the bottom of the picture of Everest at Johann’s first step up the mountain.
Among those who attended the press conference were current Prime Minister's Spokesperson, Rosy Senanayake, renowned hairdresser Ramani Fernando and Managing Director of Hameedia, Fouzul Hameed.

In a brief Q&A session following the Press Conference, Johann Peries and Jayanthi Kuru-Utumpala fielded questions from the audience. Addressing a question on the loneliness that one feels hiking up a lonely mountain, Jayanthi responded saying that they had each other’s company to tide them over the first time. Johann agreed that this would be one of the obstacles that he’d face but acknowledged that the loneliness would be easier to bear with the presence of his team.
Responding to questions regarding the physical demands of the journey, Johann explained that he would have to repeat the to and fro process of ascending and descending the mountain multiple times before he finally reaches the peak. He pointed out that under such punitive conditions, even putting on one’s shows takes 15-20 minutes. The geological changes and changes in weather patterns would be a concern and he emphasized that merely because he has been through it before, it is by no means any easier. Jayanthi pointed out that Johann’s preparation for his second attempt had commenced a mere couple of months after their return and he was definitely ready for another crack at it.
Their message to anyone who wishes to attempt conquering Mount Everest is train as much as possible, preferably in the Himalayas as conditions from mountain to mountain are incredibly diverse. They commented on their happiness at the levels of interest towards mountaineering that they have witnessed in the youth of Sri Lanka. Education is the key, being versed in the rules and getting accustomed to the conditions that one has to be face.
Johann’s primary focus will be on the victory. He is not dwelling on the possibility of failure. Having seen four people die, on his previous trek, the experience shattered him. He is aware of the mental and physical strain that the journey will bring but relies on his positivity and spiritual beliefs to see him through and knowing that Sri Lanka will be walking with him through his campaign is of great encouragement to him.
“Make the Right Decision”
When asked what she believed would be Johann’s greatest concern by the Daily News, Jayanthi Kuru-Utumpala commented that she felt that he should most definitely double check his oxygen cylinder. The first time, fatigue had caused them to skim over the checking of their cylinders and it was misfortunate that Johann was forced to turn back. He had made the wise decision and as a result was quite lucky and hopes he will continue to make the right decision. She will continue to support him and stressed that the priority is his safe return.
Passion and Positivity
Being a hairdresser by profession and an adventurer by choice Johann is driven by his passions. Having successfully climbed Island Peak in Nepal and Mt. Kilimanjaro, the highest mountain in Africa, Johann is certainly prepared for another go at Mount Everest.
Johann explained the source of his inspiration to pursue mountaineering was his father who took him on regular explorations of the Knuckles Mountain range in Sri Lanka. He is happy to say that he lives life to the fullest, driven by his passion and has his eye focussed on reaching the peak. His message to the younger generations who would be inspired by him is to follow one’s dreams. Everyone faces hardships. The key is to remain passionate and positive.
