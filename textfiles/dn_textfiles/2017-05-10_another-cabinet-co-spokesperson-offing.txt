Another Cabinet Co-Spokesperson in the offing

A third Cabinet Co-Spokesperson to represent the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) is to be appointed to deal with the media.
This would be in addition to the current Cabinet Spokesperson, Parliamentary Reforms and Mass Media Minister Gayantha Karunathilake and Co-Cabinet Spokesperson Health and Nutrition and Indigenous Medicine Minister Rajitha Senaratne, Fisheries and Aquatic Resources and UPFA General Secretary Minister Mahinda Amaraweera said at a media briefing at the SLFP Headquarters yesterday.
He added, the appointment would be made in the next few days and that several SLMP Ministers have been nominated for the post. A special meeting had been held between President Maithripala Sirisena and the SLFP ministers on the night of 4 May and they had discussed in detail the arguments which had taken place between Minister John Seneviratne and Minister Rajitha Senaratne.
“The matter had been taken up once again at the Cabinet meeting held yesterday morning and both ministers had apologised for the disagreements and regretted that they had taken place,”Amaraweera said.
The minister further stressed that at Cabinet Media briefings, journalists posed various questions at the spokespersons and that it was necessary to have the SLFP viewpoints presented in such instances.
He added that there was no issue with the delivery of Cabinet decisions but through certain wrong statements, various wrong messages were being sent to the people. The SLFP appointment, he said would help counter this and that all three spokespersons would then work in accordance with each other to express the views of the government.
