Weathering the clutches of calamity

Each year brings more hurricanes, tornadoes, earthquakes, and other natural disasters to the world. Although some parts of the world are impacted more often by these natural disasters than others, the majority of people around the world have come to face more frequent extreme weather events. Therefore, it is vital to better identify, prepare for and find ways to recover from natural and man-made disasters.
Experts from Japan, Indonesia, the Philippines, and Bangladesh joined Sri Lankan experts from different fields to share their experiences in and views on natural and man-made disasters at an international symposium organized by the Asia Pacific Alliance for Disaster Management (A-PAD SL), recently at Hilton, Colombo.
The focus of the symposium was on Urban Resilience: Building competitive cities amidst disasters. The experts emphasized the need for increased cooperation, regular dialogue and strong involvement among the government bodies, civil society, the private sector, Information Technology and disaster management experts, the Tri-Forces, and the media.
They stressed on the need for proper preparedness, mitigation, and management of disasters.
It was highlighted that as droughts and heavy rains have become a norm in Sri Lanka, in order to minimise the damage arising out of these disasters, there was a need to formulate a national policy on disaster reduction with effective and coordinated efforts of all agencies, as well as the central and local government authorities.
Government's approach to mitigate natural disaster
Sri Lanka lacks a proper mechanism when it comes to mitigating disasters, and if no effective mechanism is formulated as a matter of urgency, the cycles of floods and drought would recur annually, resulting in environmental disasters which lead to loss of lives, property, and infrastructure.
National Policies and Economic Affairs Deputy Minister Harsha de Silva delivering the keynote address at the international symposium, said the present government had formulated policies and advocated good governance approaches to prevent and mitigate disasters in Sri Lanka.
The Minister also noted that corruption among local politicians who approved illegal and unauthorised constructions needed to be eliminated.
“If you take the homes that went under water in the recent floods in Colombo and its suburbs, those houses had been built in unsuitable areas. The authorities found that houses had been built on river banks and canal reservations,” he said.
Minister de Silva alleged that local government politicians helped the settlers get approval to build houses on unauthorized lands so that they garner more votes, and added that the issue needed to be addressed from a good governance perspective. Overcoming issues pertaining to corruption, he said, would help overcome issues leading to man-made calamities in future.
In the short term, Colombo was looking at investing in flood control with dams and other structures to help avoid mass flooding, and in the longer term, the city would create large multiple reservoirs on the Kelani River to contain water before it reaches the downstream under a comprehensive programme on flood control, explained the Minister.
He was of the view that “usually, our focus was on post-disaster activities, but we also equally need to prevent the probability of people being subjected to disaster.”
“Measures to combat issues related to climate change is one of the primary objectives of the government, and to include it in the national policies,” he said.
The National Policies and Economic Affairs Deputy Minister further observed the need to invest in flood control mechanisms to reduce the probability of floods in the country.
He assured that the good governance government and the recent blue green economy concept presented by Finance Minister Mangala Samaraweera, aims to address many issues pertaining to climate change and natural disaster.
Smart cities and urban resilience
Despite unauthorized settlements leading to a greater impact on people during disasters, the Megapolis and Western Development Ministry's Western Region Megapolis Master Plan Project's Project Director Lakshman Jayasekara explained that relocation was a sensitive issue and it needed to be dealt properly sans political and other aspirations, taking an upper hand in the project formulation and implementation process.
“A project formulated to relocate people and industries prone to flood, was called off due to want of funds with international agencies failing to commit funds as they were now sensitive to issues related to relocation,” he said.
According to the experts present, studies showed that more than half of the world’s human population (approximately 3.5 billion people) live in cities. By 2030, almost 60 percent of the world’s population would live in urban areas, and it was expected to rise to 80 percent in 2050. Moreover, nearly 828 million people live in slums today and the number is expected to rise further.
Disaster Management Minister Anura Priyadarshana Yapa informed the symposium that Sri Lanka too was urbanising rapidly, and urban resilience in times of disasters was a major challenge.
He added that failure to invest in city resilience would threaten the progress being made with economic growth.
The panel noted that in the construction of buildings, industries or houses, it was vital that every aspect of life be aligned according to disaster risk reduction and management in order to develop Sri Lanka and other countries in the region to be inclusive and competitive cities amidst disasters.
According to Jayasekara, Sri Lanka was prone to many disasters and it is expected to worsen in future. This however, did not stop houses being built in inappropriate locations.
“Houses have been built on wetlands, and now people complain about floods,’’ said Jayasekara.
He mentioned that 20 percent of the western region comprised of environmentally-sensitive areas, but many people had chosen to live on these floodplains.
Sri Lanka has a poor history of implementing housing plans. The plans have been made, but they have simply remained as plans due to political interventions, said Jayasekara.
He noted that there were many shortcomings in the implementation process that took place in the past and as a result, today, they were having difficulties in finding out solutions to many of the issues that have cropped up.
Jayasekara noted that the pressure of finding a solution was going to be high, as the population in urban areas was increasing rapidly.
Role of innovation in building resilient cities
Consecutive governments have raised concerns over the increasing importance of urban resilience, which enables cities to prepare for, respond to, and recover from natural and man-made crises with minimum damage to the public and economy. But no adequate measures have been been taken as yet to combat the rising problems caused by urbanization.
The delegates at the symposium spoke of various sub themes varying from the role of private sector in the development of urban resilience, climate resilient urban planning, and business continuity.
The United Nations’ report on sustainable urbanization strategy states that cities’ vulnerability went beyond exposure to climate change impacts and extreme events. It further explained that millennials in their 20s and 30s were moving into cities at an astounding rate, attracted by the concentration and density of people that they can connect with.
At the same time, companies including startups were increasing and moving into dense, dynamic, and energetic urban centres where talented entrepreneurs, infrastructure, knowledge, and capital were clustered. These two mutually reinforcing dynamics were shifting and shaping the way cities are developed, spurring innovation and revitalization, creating new relationships between local residents, companies, and local governments, as well as exposing underlying challenges in cities.
The city is the hotbed of innovation, said Development Strategies and International Trade Ministry's Trade, Competitiveness and Innovation Programme Director Anushka Wijesingha, as he added that it needed to be made more resilient.
According to Wijesigha, we need to establish an innovative system of knowledge. This mainly translated for the requirement of better data for effective decision-making.
“We should expand the number of people who use data and there is a lot to gain in doing that. Open up spaces and data to find common solutions. Collaborative innovation needs to be encouraged whilst improving institution capacity and resilient system’, he said.
Wijesingha highlighted the importance of an open innovation challenge to enhance urban resilience.
Some natural disasters are unpredictable and the more prepared the government is, the better we mitigate disasters. This also have to be followed with a constant search for innovative solutions to prevent, mitigate, and manage disasters.
