Entries for the 2016 CEAT Mahagastota Festival of Speed are now open at the Club office. For more information competitors are requested to write to [email protected]
Participation at Mahagastota is limited to 100 entries as the fickle weather in the hills means that the event has to be concluded by early afternoon.
The serious racing happens on April 10, but as has become the practice, the CMSC partners with a number of other clubs such as the Classic Car Club of Ceylon, the Italian Car Club, the Mighty Mini Club, VW Owners Club and the Retro Car Club to conduct the Saturday 'Parade' of classic and historic cars.
The timed events on April 10 will see the CMSC's latest timekeeping equipment in action. The advent of technology has helped the event hugely from the days of stringing a copper telephone wire between the start and the finish.
Defending course record holders Nishan Weerasooriya (cars) and Ananda Sampath (Motorbike) are bound to take part in protecting their titles, while Others in the fray are Rohan de Silva, Darin Weerasinghe, Aravinda Premadsa to name a few who would strive to get the fastest time for the day.
A brand indelibly linked with motor racing in Sri Lanka, CEAT is also the title sponsor of the 2016 motor racing championship conducted by the Sri Lanka Auto-sports Drivers Association (SLADA). This is the seventh year that CEAT has played this crucial role.
CEAT also supports the race meets conducted by the Sri Lanka Army and the Sri Lanka Air Force, as well as the sport's governing body Sri Lanka Automobile Sports (SLAS).
As part of its partnership with SLAS, CEAT Kelani Holdings is the principal sponsor of all Ford Laser/Mazda 1300cc and 1500cc and Nissan March 1000 cc 'one-make' racing events conducted during the year, at which all competing drivers race on CEAT radial tyres.
