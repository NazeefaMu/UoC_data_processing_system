Kindling the artist in every child

The word, innovation is vastly used in the modern world, may it be in the business sector, corporate sector or in the art sphere. Innovators emerge via freedom of thought, freedom of expression and by engaging in joyful creative activity, a process that is followed from the childhood without hindrances. Rabindranath Tagore, in his autobiography says, freedom he was given as a child, made him the thinker he became.

Late Cora Abraham, who firmly believed in this philosophy, pioneered Melbourne Art Classes in 1949 which became Cora Abraham Art Classes after her demise in 1979.
Cora Abraham Art Classes, now held at a quiet and green environment in Thimbirigasyaya, Colombo are for children with or without inborn artistic talents, who yearn for freedom of expression.
The present Chairperson of the entity, Chandramani Thenuwara is a well versed academic with a great philosophy in life and beyond. She is assisted by the Principal of the school, Nirmala Riza.
Thenuwara said, late Cora Abraham was not only an artist but a super teacher who would encourage students to be self-confident. Her objective had been to make a breed of sensitive and self confident children who will become prudent adults.
“Cora Abraham wanted to offer little children with time and space to enjoy creative activity with the least amount of instructions. Her motto was that, we must not destroy the integrated world the little child strives to build up in his own mind,” said Thenuwara.
The Cora Abraham Art class caters to children of all ages, all ethnic groups including the differently-abled.
The entity has a scholarship programme to finance children of not-well-to-do families to attend the classes as well.
“Sri Lanka is a beautiful country with diverse religions. We encourage children to respond to every religious festival in town and bring out the beauty and significance of them,” said the Principal, Nirmala Riza.
She also said the annual exhibition of the school has a ‘Festival Corner’ where all the works of children on festivals are exhibited.
Cora Abraham art classes conduct a six-month intensive teacher-training programme for which, teachers of Colombo schools attend. “We want them to take the Cora Abraham message to their schools,” said Riza.
“We call our method, ‘expression through art’ hence the value of a particular picture is when the child has expressed himself freely. Children must be sensitive to the beauty around them and also to tragedies, people, animals and the environment. Our teachers are trained towards fulfilling this somewhat unusual objective and schools that value our service invite us to educate their Art teachers and conduct programmes for children,” said the Chairperson.
The teachers would share diverse experiences with children they have constantly. Once a child who had drawn a green elephant had told the teachers, he had seen such a picture displaced on a roadside billboard.
Cora Abraham art class does not have art competitions and neither does it conduct exams to judge the ability of children to draw. “A child sees the world differently from the way he draws hence it is ridiculous to grade talent.
Judging is very damaging for a child because if his picture is selected as the best one in a competition, he may think he is greater than his peers,” said the Chairperson. She urged the parents to refrain from imposing sophisticated ideas on their children.
“Do not let computers and phones dominate children. Personalities developed via freedom of thought and creative activity sheds light on emergence of flexible individuals and good leaders,” she stressed.
