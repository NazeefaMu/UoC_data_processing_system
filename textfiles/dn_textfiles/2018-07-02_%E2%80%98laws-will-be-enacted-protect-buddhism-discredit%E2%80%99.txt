‘Laws will be enacted to protect Buddhism from discredit’

Laws will be enacted soon to prevent the discredit and dishonour made to Buddhism by distorting the Tripitaka, Buddha Sasana Minister Gamini Jayawickreme Perera said.
An Advisory Committee with the participation of the Justice Minister is now meeting and discussing measures to be taken in this direction on the advice of the Mahanayake Theras, he said.
The Minister was speaking to the Media after he called on the Malwatte and Asgiriya Prelates at their Aramayas in Kandy and received their blessings on June 30.
The Minister said the majority of the Maha Sangha including the Mahanayake Theras have paid strict attention towards Bhikkhu Vinaya (Code of Conduct) and introducing stiff legislation to control activities of immoral sections causing harm to the Sambuddha Sasana. He briefed them on the programme proposed for the progress and welfare of the Buddha Sasana.
All the steps in this direction would be taken with the advice and blessings of the Maha Sangha.
The Minister said that some groups had distorted the Tripitake for their own benefit, and the Advisory Committee would take these matters into cognizance before making decisions.
Minister Perera said he would discuss the possibility of extending the student insurance scheme to pirivena students too with the Education Minister. He was planning to introduce an insurance scheme for pirivena teachers and a health insurance scheme for elderly bhikkhus, so that they could claim insurance cover during illnesses.
Buddha Sasana Ministry Secretary Chandraprema Gamage and Kandy Regional Commissioner of Buddhist Affairs Parakrama Jayawardene were present.
