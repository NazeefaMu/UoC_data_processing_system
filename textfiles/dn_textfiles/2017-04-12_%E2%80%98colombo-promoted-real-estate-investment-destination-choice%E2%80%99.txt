‘Colombo promoted as Real Estate Investment Destination of choice’

At an Investor Forum in Hong Kong, and in Colombo Stock Exchange / Securities Exchange roadshows in Sydney and Melbourne, Indocean Developers Director, Pradeep Moraes focused on the combination of factors that are uniquely offered by Sri Lanka to international investors in the high end real estate market.
Revealing little known or not often recognized market features, Moraes convincingly presented a case for International investment in a market that is robust, has high upside, is 90% equity funded, locally fuelled by 60% of purchases, as attracted large investment from multinationals, and has all demand drivers on the rise.
All three events were very well attended both in terms of numbers and profile, and interest was keen and serious.
Moraes also stressed that hi end apartments are well poised to play a significant role as high value contributors to FDI in Sri Lanka, with the added advantage that the asset is as tangible as it gets and remains anchored in Sri Lanka.
