Inland Revenue Bill for debate next week

The Inland Revenue Bill is scheduled to be taken up for debate in Parliament next week. A full day debate has been facilitated on the bill on August 25 from 11.30 am to 7.30 pm. Finance and Mass Media Minister Mangala Samaraweera said the Government would move a series of amendments to the Bill at its committee stage.
“We will have the debate on August 25 and put off the vote till the next session, as we have a series of Amendments that will take about half a day to move in the house. The Amendments will be moved next month,” the Minister said.
The Supreme Court determined that several Clauses in the Inland Revenue Bill are inconsistent with the Constitution. The Government said it would duly amend the problematic clauses by following the Supreme Court order.
The Government presented the Bill in Parliament for the first reading on July 5. The Bill is to provide for the imposition of Income Tax for any year of assessment commencing on or after April 1, 2017. The Bill, among other things, introduces a new income tax structure and is aimed at closing existing loopholes in revenue collection.
