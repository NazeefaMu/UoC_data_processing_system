We will cooperate with UNP chairman for Mahiyangana’s benefit - SLFP

Fostering transparency and accountability and team spirit will be vital for our success, chief SLFP organizer for Mahiyangana K.P. Gunawardhana said, at a meeting of the Mahiyangana Pradeshiya Sabha recently.
Gunawardhana, who is also a local government member in the Badulla district, said that those who were in power and have now been in the political wilderness for their wrongdoings do not seem to repent, much less learn from their blunders.
“It is our duty to work for the benefit of the local public, ensuring transparency and accountability in the projects carried out by us. The politicians who are shedding copious tears for the people of Mahiyangana should answer the question as to why they abused power and earned unconscionably high profits by utilising community properties unlawfully, if their concerns about Mahiyangana are genuine.”
“As Sri Lanka is an established democracy, everybody should stick to the law, not merely to the letter of the law, but also through concrete action of the judiciary,” he said.
“And the yahapaalana government has done a lot of work toward this end.” He said that the wrongdoers of Mahiyangana wouldn’t have had to swallow their pride and grovel before an independent group which entered the fray during the February 10 polls, if they had done their duties properly while compiling the list of nominations for the local government elections. As well as at the poll, they had to feel frustrated at their lack of progress at the inaugural meeting of the new Mahiyangana Pradeshiya Sabha where they failed to grab the much expected ‘first seat’ there - it went to an eligible person.
R. M. Karu Weeraratna who was appointed to the chairmanship of the 6th Mahiyangana Pradeshiya Sabha, was the chairman of the local government body of Rideemaaliyadda Pradeshiya Sabha in the Mahiyangana electorate previously, Gunawardhana said.
Although he is from the United National Party (UNP), the four of us from SLFP will cooperate with him for the benefit of Mahiyangana, he said.
