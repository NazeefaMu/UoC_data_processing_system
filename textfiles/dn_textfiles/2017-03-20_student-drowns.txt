Student drowns

A 17-year-old boy who told his parents that he was going to watch the ‘Battle of the Maroons’, the big match between Dharmaraja vs Kingswood, but instead went for a swim in the Mahaweli River with friends, was drowned on Friday.
The boy, a student of Dharmaraja College, Kandy, had gone for a swim in the Mahaweli River near Seemamalakaya, Halloluwa on Friday afternoon.
Navy divers had recovered the body on Saturday. Police had found that the student had gone to the Pallekelle grounds to watch the big match in the morning, but had left shortly with his friends to have a bath in the river.
Nearly 50 deaths have been reported by drowning in the Mahaweli River in the Halloluwa area and several warning signs had been put up warning the people to avoid bathing in the river near the Seemamalakaya, Police said.
