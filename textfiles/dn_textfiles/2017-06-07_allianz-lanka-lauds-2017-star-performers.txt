Allianz Lanka lauds 2017 star performers

Allianz Lanka celebrated the achievements of its team members at its annual sales convention, the Allianz Awards 2017, held at the Cinnamon Lakeside recently.
Allan Smee, Head of Property and Casualty, Allianz Asia Pacific, was the chief guest of the evening and Allianz Lanka’s Chief Executive Officer Surekha Alles was the guest of honour.
Held annually to nurture the performance culture that Allianz is renowned for around the world, the Allianz Awards seek to recognise and reward individual successes, outstanding team effort and effective partnerships.
Eighty-eight star performers were recognised for their stellar performance during 2016 in the presence of the extended Allianz Lanka team.
Vasugi Mohanaruban from the Thurunalveli branch, Salman Cassim from the Galle branch and Sameera Kaluperuma from the Colombo Metro branch were adjudged the overall best performers in the Life and Non-Life companies and walked away with the grand Champion of Champions trophies.
Ruchera Perera, Senior Manager – Technical (Life), bagged the Director’s Award. Upul Dissanayake, Assistant General Manager - Information Technology and Indika Kumarasinghe, Senior Manager - Information Technology were the joint runners up for the Directors' Award.
The seven qualifiers for membership of the insurance industry’s coveted Million Dollar Round Table (MDRT) produced by Allianz Life Insurance Lanka in 2016, the largest ever contingent to represent the company, were also felicitated with special awards at the event.
Congratulating the winners, Surekha Alles, Chief Executive Officer - Allianz Lanka, said,“Since our inception in 2005, Allianz Lanka has grown into a formidable player in Sri Lanka’s insurance industry. 2016 was a year of exponential growth for the company and that was made possible only by the steadfast commitment and relentless efforts of all members of the Allianz Lanka team. Continuing to question the status quo and drive change, they help us strengthen our position as one of the strongest insurance companies in the market. And we are delighted to recognise and reward their spirit of excellence at the annual Allianz Awards.”
With customers at the heart of everything it does, Allianz Lanka’s business is based on the four pillars of customer centricity, digital and technical excellence, stronger growth and employees.
In line with this, the company stepped up its efforts to provide customers with a service that exceeds their expectations through digitisation. With 2016 having been declared as the ‘Year of Mobility’, sales teams were equipped with necessary tools to provide customers with speedy quotes.
The company also introduced a ‘roaming office’ facility to enable teams to work from anywhere, anytime.
The above initiatives together with the phenomenal performance of teams across the company helped Allianz Lanka register outstanding growth in 2016.
