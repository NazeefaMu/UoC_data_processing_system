Padmaavat: Stroke of visual brilliance

Formerly titled ‘Padmavathi’ Sanjay Leela Bhansali’s ‘Padmaavat’ has been much hyped about mainly due to the controversy surrounding the movie. Movie buffs might have ventured to theaters mainly out of curiosity. However they will not be disappointed because the veteran filmmaker had created a spectacle of visual brilliance.
Based on a Sufi poem of the same name written in 1540 by Malik Muhammad Jayasi, ‘Padmaavat’ has its own uniqueness. It is Bansali’s interpretation of the tale. Another factor which might arouse interest among the Sri Lankan movie enthusiasts is that Padmavathi is actually of Sri Lankan origin. Maharawal Ratan Singh, the ruler of Mewar, encounters her as he visits Sri Lanka to get pearls from the isle to take back to his queen. When Padmavathi and Ratan fall in love with each other he marries her and takes her back to India. This fairytale like atmosphere is brought out brilliantly in the deer hunting scene when we encounter Padmavathi for the first time. She is like a nymph in her glowing white attire as she leaps over the shrubs in pursuit of her prey.
Deepika Padukone plays her character to a tee. She delivers what could probably be the best performance in her career so far as she uses her words, gestures and eyes to express her emotions. She manages to carry the weight of the movie on her shoulders with ease with her beauty, brains and valour.
Shahid Kapoor who has taken critics by surprise due to the recent display of his acting prowess in ‘Haider’n and ‘Udta Punjab’, further proves his mettle by getting into Ratan’s shoes. He is a vision of regal glory and Rajput pride. Ranveer Singh as Alauddin Khilji is seen as a barbaric Sultan, is consumed with a ravenous libido for power and flesh. He is obsessed with Padmavathi to the point of madness. The scenes between him and Shahid are some of the most engrossing as there is a chilling quality of good vs evil in them. The trio together makes a package of commendable acting talent. Aditi Rao Hydari too stands her ground in the supporting role as the naive Mehrunissa who discovers her husband’s true identity too late. Each and every member in the cast is spot on with their roles. The costumes are breath taking and the dialogues are effective. There is not a dull moment in this larger-than-life retelling.
The only minus point probably lies in the effects in the action/ war scenes. These do not meet the expectations raised by a film of this standard. The songs too could have been more infectious but provide visual delight.
