IATA agents fear other airlines may zero-rate commission like SriLankan

Airline ticketing agents are in a quandary after the national carrier SriLankan Airlines cut commission on air tickets to zero on July 1.
“Zero commission will be very tough on agencies, big and small,” said IATA (International Air Transport Association) Sri Lanka President and George Steuarts Travels Director/CEO Channa Wijemanne.
About 90% of SriLankan’s business is driven through agents whose income is derived from the commission they receive.
IATA agents fear other airlines may adopt SriLankan’s new policy of zero-rating commission. “I only hope and pray other airlines don’t follow suit,” said Wijemanne.
He said agents don’t just sell tickets. They also assist passengers with passport and visa formalities, the latter a particular hassle for Sri Lankan citizens. Meeting these overheads minus the income from commission will be a tough call.
“We do all the spadework for SriLankan; we contribute a lot to the national carrier. Where do we earn the money for these services? How are we to pay staff and meet other expenditure,” asked Wijemmane.
Thai Airways, Qatar Airways and Etihad Airways have also zero-rated commissions. Emirates has slashed commissions from 7% to 3%.
SriLankan steadily decreased the commission on air tickets from 7% to 5% to 2% and finally to zero.
The zero-rating was to happen in April but was postponed after IATA agents negotiated with the airline. A second meeting last June proved unfruitful for agents with the airline determined to enforce zero-rating from July 1.
The silver lining in the cloud is that the flag carrier has promised agents to look at alternatives like performance-based incentives to offset the loss of commission. Airlines like Qatar Airways and Etihad do offer such incentives.
“We are confident that the airline will recognize our contribution and offer suitable incentives. The national carrier and agents must work hand-in-hand in this matter,” said Wijemanne.
Agents will also obviously look at promoting airlines that offer commission instead of SriLankan, Wijemanne said.
He however conceded that SriLankan is the largest airline operating out of the island, particularly to regional giants India and China to which the island is looking to grow its economy; that in effect means SriLankan constitutes the agents’ bottomline. How matters will pan out remains to be seen, particularly in face of the government’s intention to make an announcement about the proposed privatization of SriLankan.
