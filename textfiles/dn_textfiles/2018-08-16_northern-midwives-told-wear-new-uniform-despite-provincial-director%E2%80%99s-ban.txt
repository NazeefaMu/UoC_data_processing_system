Northern midwives told to wear new uniform despite Provincial Director’s ban

All circulars issued by the Health Ministry are valid for the entire country. Accordingly, midwives serving in the Northern Province should wear their new uniform, despite the order given to them by the Provincial Director of Health Services not to wear it, Health Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne said.
Minister Senaratne was addressing a meeting at the Health Ministry with the Midwives Association, recently.
The midwives expressed their satisfaction over the new uniform introduced to them. However, midwives serving in the Northern Province had informed the minister that they are unable to wear it due to the ban imposed by the Provincial Director of Health Services.
Minister Senaratne said all midwives must adhere to the rules and regulations of the Health Ministry.
“A new training school for midwives will be opened at Yatadolawatte in the Kalutara district soon. A building complex at Yatadolawatte is now being used to train midwives.
“A total of 1,300 new midwives will be recruited soon to end the shortage of midwives in the country. A total of 473 midwives are now being trained at Nurses Training Schools. They will be given appointments once they complete their training,” the minister said.
