COPE report on 19 public enterprises: UNP backbenchers disappointed at pace of FCID, BC probes

The UNP backbenchers yesterday expressed their dissatisfaction at the pace with which investigations are carried on by the Financial Crimes Investigation Division (FCID) and the Bribery Commission (BC) on the COPE report on 19 public enterprises tabled in Parliament last August 9, 2016.
They also demanded swift investigations into these public enterprises, while questioning the autonomy of the independent bodies responsible to conduct investigations in this regard.
The 19 public enterprises in the report include the Bank of Ceylon, Ceylon Electricity Board, LTL Holdings, Rakna Arakshaka Lanka, SriLankan Airlines, State Pharmaceuticals Corporation, Central Bank, Sri Lanka Cricket, Janata Estate Development Board, Agriculture and Agrarian Insurance Board, Lankaputra Development Bank and Ceylon Petroleum Corporation among others.
“The COPE committee tabled this report in Parliament last August for a debate. The Speaker of Parliament then forwarded the report to the investigating bodies for which the investigation had not been expedited. They are still carrying out the investigations,” UNP MP Harshana Rajakaruna complained.
Rajakaruna pointed out that the COPE report on 19 public enterprises should receive equal attention that the report on Central Bank Bond issue scam did.
“None of these cases should be probed after they are debated in Parliament. Investigations on all these cases must be hastened,” Rajakaruna said. The UNP backbenches are actively involved in discussing problems as these, Rajakaruna also said.
“We are not like the former MPs who minded their own business. We positively communicate with the government and with our party, while steering hard to right the issues we have. We do not hold media displays. But, our struggle for the best might grow into a visible one,”he said.”As the government, we are unable to influence the investigating institutes to accelerate the inquiries because they are independent bodies,” he also pointed out. .
“We urge President Maithripala Sirisena, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe and these responsible institutes to quicken these investigations.” Rajakaruna said.
MP Rajakaruna also said they are feeling skeptical whether the institutes responsible for investigations are genuinely impartial.
“These institutions do not seem to give priority to large scale scams but keep focusing too much attention on less significant ones,” he said.
Speaking on the Joint Opposition’s claims on the national carrier’s aircraft order controversy, MP Rajakaruna said the allegations made by the JO are made of old cloth.
“The JO is trying to make the present government look guilty over the wrongs they had committed,” he said.
“The contract to order these aircraft was singed even without Cabinet approval. The former SriLankan Airlines Chairman was a relative of ex-President Rajapaksa who allegedly reacted these like their own private property. It is their fault that a profitable company like the national carrier faced a disaster like this,” Rajakaruna continued.
He pointed out the government’s decision to cancel the contract after discussing with the Cabinet was the best option.
“We were able to cancel this order by paying only 98 million dollars. If we did, we would have to pay 604 million dollars instead.” he said.
Rajakaruna also said it was the Rajapaksa regime that challenged the Emirates Airlines owner’s visa and cancelled the contract with the Emirates which resulted in the national carrier which recorded a profit of Rs.4.4 billion in 2008, ended up incurring an alleged loss amounting to Rs. 107 billion.
UNP MP Harshana Rajakaruna was speaking at a media brief held at Department of Government Information. UNP MP Wijepala Hettiarachchi also spoke.
