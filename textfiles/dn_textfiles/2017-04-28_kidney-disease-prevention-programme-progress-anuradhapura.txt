Kidney disease prevention programme in progress in Anuradhapura

A kidney disease prevention programme jointly launched by western and ayurvedic doctors is in progress in the Anuradhapura district.
Kotalawala Defence University Senior Lecturer Dr. Nishantha Kumarasinghe who pioneered the kidney disease treatment integrated module said a clinic in the integrated module has been started in Kebithigollewa in collaboration with the provincial Ayurvedic Department.
He said patients treated continuously for 6 - 9 months have shown signs of recovering from the disease.
At a recently held Anuradhapura District Agricultural Committee Meeting, it was disclosed that the disease had expanded to 22 Divisional Secretariat divisions in the Anuradhapura district.
