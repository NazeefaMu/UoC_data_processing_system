‘Disaster responsibility does not lie solely on govt’

The opposition cannot say that the responsibility for disasters lies only on the ruling party. The opposition also has a role to play in disastrous situations, said Fisheries and Aquatic Resources Minister Mahinda Amaraweera, addressing a meeting at Hambantota.
The minister said, the opposition, as the representative of the people, must bear a portion of the burden.
The ruling party and the opposition must join hands with each other in providing relief to the drought-stricken people. The minister further said that half the population in Sri Lanka is suffering today due to these disasters. We now bear the responsibility of raising the living, financial and social conditions of such people.
