Cruise has fallen for Vanessa Kirby

Tom Cruise hasn’t been in a serious relationship since his divorce from Katie Holmes back in 2012. But according to InTouch Weekly, the Mission: Impossible 6 actor has fallen for his co-star in the movie Vanessa Kirby. Cruise cast Kirby in the movie after he was impressed with her performance in the TV series The Crown.
“Tom flipped for her work. He told the other M:I producers that he had to have Vanessa for a crucial role in the franchise’s sixth installment. He’s blown away by her endless charm and energy,” a source told DailyMail.co.uk. According to the website, the source also claimed that Cruise, 54, wants to get married to the 28-year-old actress, as he thinks it’s time for him to get settled down again.
