Polly Pocket makes a comeback


Barbie may be one of the top dogs when it comes to toys, but those of us over a certain age will remember another Mattel favourite - Polly Pocket.
Your poor parents may also remember all the times they trod on your dinky Polly Pocket pieces with less fondness. Polly Pocket was launched in 1989, originally under Bluebird toys until 1998, when it was taken over by toy-giant Mattel.
Sadly, despite its early nineties success (over 10 million compacts were sold overall), and despite a make-over, Polly Pocket was eventually discontinued.
But not for much longer.
According to Buzzfeed , Polly Pocket is getting a relaunch and they’ll be hitting shelves this June. They’ve also been given a new look, with the updated dolls now slightly bigger than the ones of the late eighties.
Polly Pocket was the brainchild of Chris Wiggs, who designed them in 1983 for his daughter, using a powder compact to house the dolls at the start. For now, the re-launch is in the US, where the toy will be rolled out nationwide.
If you’ve been diligently hanging on to your original Polly Pocket compacts, then they could be worth a lot of money. Rare versions of the toys, which went out of production in 2015, are are being sold on eBay.co.uk for huge sums.
