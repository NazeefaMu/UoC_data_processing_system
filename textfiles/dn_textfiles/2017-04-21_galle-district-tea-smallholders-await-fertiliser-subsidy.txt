Galle district tea smallholders await fertiliser subsidy

Seventy two tea smallholders’ societies in the Galle district have not received fertiliser subsidies so far. This was revealed during the District Agriculture Committee meeting held at the Galle District Secretariat yesterday presided over by Galle District Secretary S. Kodikara.
The Galle district boasts 205 tea smallholders’ societies with 81,225 members. It cost Rs. 532 million to pay the subsidy for the membership, sources said. By April this year, Rs. 287.5 million was paid to 47,416 tea smallholders for the subsidy and an additional Rs. 244.3 million is needed to fully address the issue, Tea Small Holders Authority Galle Regional Manager Indika Mohetti said.
