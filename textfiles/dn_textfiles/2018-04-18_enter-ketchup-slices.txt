Enter ketchup slices!

Tomato ketchup just got the make-over no one asked for. American company Bo’s Fine Foods has created a solid version of the perennially popular condiment which comes in individual packets.
They are perfect for carrying around with you, in case of a soggy burger emergency. There’s more good news. While the slices may look a little odd, they come with the bonus of being all-natural and preservative free.
So how did it come to exist?
Bo’s Fine Foods co-founder Emily stumbled across the idea while working with one of her restaurateur father’s recipes for barbecue sauce.
The recipe required braising lots of vegetables but then throwing them away
Wanting to avoid that amount of waste, Emily then mixed them, ground them, and dried them out, with the accidental end-result being her slices.
Emily also decided to do away with the preservatives and high fructose corn syrup typically used in ketchup, instead using healthier ingredients.
The finished product is eight slices per packet - which don’t need to be kept in the fridge.
They’re now trying to raise money on Kickstarter , with the creators saying:
“Bo’s Original Slice of Sauce is an individual slice of flavour-packed condiment offering a portable, convenient, clean label experience.”
