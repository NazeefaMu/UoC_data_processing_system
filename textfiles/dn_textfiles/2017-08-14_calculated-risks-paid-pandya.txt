Calculated risks paid off - Pandya

PALLEKELE: India’s man of the hour Hardik Pandya said that he took a calculated risk when he saw that Sri Lanka had spread the field for him and it paid off handsomely as he lifted his team to a position from which they could pressure on the Sri Lankan batsmen.
Pandya scored a calculated century off 86 balls pummelling the Lankan bowlers for seven sixes and equal number of fours to lift India from 339-7 to 487 all out.
“Could there have been a bigger opportunity than that? Nine wickets were already down and I knew, if stay in the crease and connect the ball well, it would go for six. Even if I were to mishit, I had to. I had no choice,” said Pandya at the end of the second day. “It was an ideal opportunity and obviously there was a team’s goal which was a 400-run target and we scored close to 490.”
In one over of Malinda Pushpakumara, Pandya slammed him for 26 runs the most by an Indian in the Test cricket.
“It just happened, honestly I didn’t want to go all over in that over but I don’t know what happened. Maybe I was connecting pretty well, let me try this over and scored 26 runs, feels obviously good,” said Pandya. “From there I saw the scoreboard and I was batting on 80 and I was like, wow! Then I noticed I was in the zone, I don’t usually look at the scoreboard, I don’t want to know what’s happening around. I just focus on how I can help the innings progress.”
Pandya said that he learnt from MS Dhoni the former Indian captain was to play for the team.
“When I bat, I don’t think about my personal scores and achievements. It has helped me enough. One thing I learned from Mahi bhai is that you always put your team ahead, see the scoreboard and play accordingly. That has helped me throughout.”
Recognised for his talent as a T20 cricketer Pandya said that he was lucky to get a break in Test cricket. “God has been pretty kind to me. I am pretty lucky I got things pretty quickly in life. I am just happy that way. I have worked hard enough and I am getting whatever I have worked hard for. It is not easy but I don’t mind it.” - ST
