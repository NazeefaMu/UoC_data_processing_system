Lankasoy enters European Market

Convenience Foods (Lanka) PLC, market leader in the manufacture and marketing of textured soy protein products under the Lankasoy brand in Sri Lanka, recently announced that it has successful entered into the European market. Being a subsidiary of the country’s premier food manufacturer – Ceylon Biscuits Limited (CBL), Convenience Foods recently tied up with a leading Dutch dealer, securing a supply of consignment to Netherlands.
Convenience Foods delivers a range of innovative and high quality textured soy protein (TSP) products under household brand name Lankasoy. Being the pioneer in introducing soy nuggets to the Sri Lankan consumers, Lankasoy has been instrumental in developing and shaping the soy food market by introducing an exciting range of flavours for vegetarian and non-vegetarian consumers. This in turn has made Lankasoy a trendsetter for its counterparts and even inspired a number of new brands to enter the local market. Elevating its standards and heightening its product innovation, Lankasoy has delivered a host of shapes and revolutionary flavours to suit the taste spectrum of its discerning consumers. And over the years the brand has steadily grown, spreading its foot print in both local and overseas markets. At present, Lankasoy products thrive in Middle Eastern and Maldivian markets, thereby making the entry to European market yet another iconic achievement for Lankasoy.
Commenting on the occasion, Thilanka De Soyza, Managing Director of Convenience Foods (Lanka) PLC noted, “We are the pioneers in soy manufacturing and marketing in Sri Lanka, and our products have been accredited both locally and internationally with ISO 22000, HACCP, ISO 9001, OHSAS 18001 and GMP certification in addition to SLS.”
“Garnering these certifications have given the edge to Lankasoy as a brand on par with the global food quality standards. European food standards are one of the highest in the world, and our partnership with the Dutch market clearly testifies the superior quality of Lankasoy products. We believe that the new synergy will not only help us establish a strong footprint in Dutch market, but also open new avenues to effectively penetrate the rest of the European market.”
