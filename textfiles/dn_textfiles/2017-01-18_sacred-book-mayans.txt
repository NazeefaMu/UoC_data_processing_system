Sacred book of the Mayans

Maya Civilization expanded towards a massive area covering all the Yucatan peninsula, modern day Guatemala, Belize, Mexico states of Tabasco, Chiapas and the western parts of Honduras and El Salvador.
The area covered by Maya civilization was divided into three zones of Southern Maya Highlands, Central Maya Lowlands and Northern Maya Lowlands.
Southern Maya Highlands comprised of all the elevated terrain of Guatemala and Chiapas Unlike other segregated societies in Mesoamerica, the Maya civilization emerged most dominant due to its topography. The Mayan Civilization maintained a prominent place as the founders and domesticators of agricultural products, hieroglyph writers, calendar makers, mathematicians and astronomers.
The staple food crops cultivated by Maya comprised of Maize, Beans, Squashes, Chilli Pepers, Avocados and Gourds. The Maya society was comprised of kings, ruling families, and a large class of priests who maintained a very complex calendar and transmitting knowledge of writing, astronomy and mathematics. The Maya merchants in addition to be engaged in trade deals, played the roles of ambassadors of neighbouring lands and allies. In addition, there were professional architects and sculptors who supervised the construction of huge monuments, temples, pyramids, the palaces and other public buildings and infrastructure development.
The Maya artisans had been employed in the production of pottery, tools, and elaborate cotton textiles. Physical labour had been provided by the peasants and slaves in all the construction sites.
The Maya invented the concept of Zero represented by a stylized symbol of a sea shell and their mathematical notation enabled them to write very large numbers in their carved inscriptions and codices.
The Decimal System based on 10 was not found to be used by the mathematicians of the Maya civilization. Instead a counting system based on 20 known as ‘ Vigesimal ’ was used. According to scholars the unit 20 had been used because it matched with the number of fingers and the toes of a human being.
Maya mathematicians and scribes used ‘dots’ and ‘bars’ in their writings. In writing 4 they used only simple dots.
The Maya calendar was interlinked the Solar year of 365 days and dealt on Agricultural Circle and the Ritual year of 260 days dealt on daily affairs by organizing time into twenty months having 13 days per month.
In addition to the 260 day calendar and 365 day calendar the Maya developed a much longer measuring system known as ‘ Long Count.’. This Long Count system was in existence in many parts of Mesoamerica at the beginning of the first millennium B.C.
The calendar of 260 day is still used by the Quiche Maya people living in the tropical mountains ranges of Southern Guatemala. During the classical period of 250 B.C. -900 A.D. the Maya used the Long Count system in recording births, deaths, important dates of the Royalty, anniversary celebrations, dates of ritual practices and war victories.
Combining astronomical observations and knowledge of mathematics Maya priests calculated. The length of the Solar Year at 365.242 days about seventeen seconds shorter than the figure reached by the modern astronomers. .
Ruins of Maya Civilization could be found in Beilze, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, and in Mexico and some of the Monumental Architecture and Sculptor sites are Chichen Itza, Palenque, Uxal, Yaxchilan in Mexico, Tikal in Guatemala and Copan in Honduras.
Maya inherited a unique type of a ball game and the ball courts are found scattered throughout the Maya empire. High ranking captives were found taking part in the ball game and losers become sacrificial victims.
Popol Vuh, according to its translator Dennis Tedlock who was also a shaman –priest of Maya in Guatemala was a store house rich in stories on Creation, Ancestry, History, Cosmology, Noble Mayan Families of Quiche and the Maya Dynasties. Popol Vuh highlights the traditional Views of Mayas on the creation of the universe and human beings. The Creation Myth in Popol Vuh narrates how the gods attempted to create intelligent human beings that would recognize and praise them.
“Before time began, the waters stretched out endlessly in all directions beneath a blank sky and nothing existed in the universe. There were no animals or fish, no birds or plants, no rocks or people.
There was only the Sea God known as Sovereign Plumed Serpent having some other names such as Quetzalcoatl, Gucumatz and Kukulcan feared and worshipped across Mesoamerica.
The Sky God Huracan felt the presence of the Sky God Plumed Serpent. Huracan the Sky God came down to meet the Sovereign Plumed Serpent the Sea God. Both of them were great intellectuals and during their deep conversation they had a vision how life should be in the world.
They discussed how to introduce vegetation, how to create human beings and other forms of life on the earth. First they decided that the waters should be cleared for the earth to rise up.
