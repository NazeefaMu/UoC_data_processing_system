Status of faith

Ganas are the common decorative elements seen in most of the Indian and Sri Lankan historical archaeological sites. Gana figures are common decorative elements found in most of the ancient architectural and archaeological sites of India and Sri Lanka.
Most of the common masses consider the Gana figures were only used for decorative purposes in ancient times to adhere to the beauty of the ancient constructions. Many times the common masses fail to understand the rhythmic beauty of the body movements and beautiful body positions of these decorative Ganas. But today instead of the decorative elements, animal and bird figures like elephants, lions and swans are often depicted to decorate the outer wall constructions.
The decorative elements of Ganas are often called “Puthams” in Tamil. The Ganas are depicted with numerous body positions. The decorative Gana sculptures are beautifully exhibited with different body positions and stances along with limited ornamental decorations.
Polonnaruwa constructions
Gana figures are common features in Sri Lanka and India during the 10th and 12th centuries. In India, many of the South Indian Hindu temples and cultural chambers were decorated with Gana figures. In Sri Lanka, similar Gana figure decorations are common features during the Polonnaruwa period constructions and afterwards. In Sri Lankan history the late Anuradhapura period and Polonnaruwa period sculptures have very close links and resemblance with the contemporary Indian Chola period sculptures.
Many of the Chola period Indian Hindu temples and cultural chambers were exquisitely decorated with numerous Ganas with different stances. Still, these decorative sculptures are well preserved in numerous ancient archaeological sites of India and Sri Lanka.
Similarly, the Sri Lankan Gana figures were used to decorate ancient Buddhist temples and Buddhist constructional places. The body structure of the Ganas is quite different from that of the general human body. The physical body structure of the Ganas resembles dwarfs. They are short in size, but the body positions resemble the beautiful rhythmic dance postures.
Most of the body positions, stances, and ornamental decorations of Sri Lankan Ganas resemble Indian dances. Even after the Chola period Gana sculptural decorations continued in the Hindu religious places and cultural chambers in India and Sri Lanka. Many decorative Ganas adopted numerous body positions which are deeply rooted in the typical Natya Sastra traditions.
Limited edition
The Ganas are always adorned with selective ornamental decorations. Normally ears of the Ganas are adorned with ring type of ear ornaments, a simple one or two necklaces decorate their necks and a very limited number of bangles adorns the hands and anklets adorn the legs. Ornamental decorations and decorative Ganas are generally considered as decorative elements in the ancient archaeological constructions. Generally, most of the masses consider Ganas as only decorative elements, but a few only appreciate the aesthetic values of the Gana decorative elements. Indeed the Gana figures have numerous excellent aesthetic values.
Different body and foot positions, glances and head positions are very well seen in the Ganas. Different rhythmic dance movements are well depicted through numerous body positions, head positions, neck positions and eye glances of the Ganas, resemble the dance postures and dance stances. The majority of the poses have close links with typical Bharata Natya Isthana (position) such as the body poses.
