Iswan heads CPRFU

Former Trinity College ruggerite Iswan Omar who won his colors in 1967 and the Lion in 1969 was elected the new president of the CPRFU (Central Province Rugby Football Union) at the AGM held at the Kandy Sports Club house on Sunday.
As a schoolboy he played for Kandy S.C. in 1969. Later he sported the Kandy Lake Club, Kandy RFC, Uva, Dimbulla A & CC, Dickoya MCC and Up-Country colors and was in the National pool but had to step out of the scrum due to a knee injury. Kandy's ruggerites are happy over his appointment. As in the past as secretary and the first time as president he did a good job and so the same can be expected from him this time too.
The two best ever presidents CPRFU were fortunate to have seen in rugby promotion was none other than Iswan Omar who returns and late Maurice Perera.

Samarawickrema made it all possible
Malik Samarawickrema like good wine needs no bush. With his expertise in all forms of the game of rugby he expertly piloted the Kandy rugby ship to sink other rugby ships and be the rugby ship of all. Today rugby is the biggest spectator sport in Kandy and this game has become the city's national game and everyone appreciates it very much.
It shows the love and interest for the game. Many remember the glorious moments of the club and off all the names, the one that readily comes to mind is the man who promoted the game, to achieve great heights not seen in the long history of the club and he is none other than former Royal, CR and FC and Sri Lanka scrumhalf Malik Samarawickrema who with his onerous duties as Minister took time to steer the club to its present status at rugby.
This season in the league Kandy SC became unbeaten champions. When the history of rugby is written at Nittawela and the controlling body, the name of Malik Samarawickrema will be written in letters of gold and will stand out as one if not the greatest administrator the sport has had.
Today

Musical chairs at KDCA elections
Kandy District Cricket Association (KDCA) came alive after three long years. Yes at last they were able to hold their AGM at Hotel Amaya Hills, however most of the representatives were not happy that they were not informed about the meeting in time, and had to go to collect the AGM notice. It is said by the club representatives that since last year there had been no AGM or committee meetings. So, the two factions who were two different groups at the Sri Lanka Cricket AGM were seen together at this 'musical chairs' that has been going on for the 18 years or so. At the AGM the previous vice president Janaka Pathirana was elected president and former president Thilina Tennakoon became vice president. The secretary was previous vice president Tissa Jayasinghe and former secretary Roland Perera came one of the vice presidents. Now the question among the cricket lovers is will club tournaments be revived? Today there are no club tournaments whatsoever. Will KDCA be back and kicking like in the good old days when people like the late Dr. VHL Anthonisz as secretary Dr. C.D.L. Fernando, late Dr. A. S. Uduwella, Harindra Dunuwille were presidents and helped in the game's progress and took it to great heights.
