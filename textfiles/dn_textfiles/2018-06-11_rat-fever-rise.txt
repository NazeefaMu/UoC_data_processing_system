Rat fever on the rise

HPB Director Dr. Palihawadana informs the public that all information about Leptospirosis, about the drug used to prevent it (Doxycycline) and other details can be obtained by dialing the hot line 0710107107. The service is free of charge and available during 24 hours. Well qualified doctors and Consultants will reply all inquiries.
Health Promotion Bureau (HPB) warns the public on possible outbreak of Rat Fever (Letospirosis) in the flood affected areas. The public should be vigilant on any type of fever. Around 1400 Leptospirosis patients have already been reported from all over the country since January this year.
According to the Epidemiologists, vulnerable people such as farmers, persons who clean drains, persons who work in mines, marsh lands, canals and persons who swim or play in contaminated water should contact the nearest PHI or MOH office and obtain Doxycycline tablets free of charge and they should take two tablets before they start their work. They should drink plenty of water while working. The tablets give around 90 percent protection for a period
of one week. Then they should take two tablets again after they finish their work.
The public should avoid contaminated water such as flood water. Paddy fields and places with still water should be kept clean without garbage. The persons who have cuts and wounds (open injuries) in their legs should cover them properly before stepping into paddy fields. The persons engaged in paddy cultivation are advised to keep the area around the paddy fields clean, ensure the existing water is flushed prior to cultivation and the ‘Niyara’ is kept narrow and free of rat burrows.
The main symptoms of rat fever are abrupt onset of high fever, mild flu, chills, conjunctival suffusion, muscle tenderness (notable in calf and lumber areas), intense headache, jaundice area and decrease of passing urine. The symptoms arise after 5 to 14 days of infection.
It is very important to seek medical treatment as early as possible from a Government hospital without applying home remedies.
The disease can be completely cured if medical treatment given on time but it is difficult to save the life of a patient who seeks medical treatment when the disease comes to later stages where renal failure, heart failure and other symptoms appear.
Wild rats who live in open environment are more dangerous than the domestic rats. Rat Fever is an infectious disease caused by pathogenic bacteria and lives in the kidneys of animals such as rats, pigs, cattle, rodents, canines and wild mammals. It comes to soil, water or food through their urine and enters into human body through cuts, wounds, nasal, oral, eye or mucous membranes. The bacteria live in the environment over a period of one month.
