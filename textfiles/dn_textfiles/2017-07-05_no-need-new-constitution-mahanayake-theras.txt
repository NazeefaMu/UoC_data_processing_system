No need for new Constitution: Mahanayake Theras

The Mahanayake Theras of three Nikayas yesterday decided that there is no need to bring in new Constitution. The Maha Sangha led by the Mahanayake Theras of three Nikayas were of the view that a new Constitution will create more conflicts in the country.
They proposed that the government bring in an amendment to the Constitution changing the existing electoral system.
The Maha Sangha opined that the existing electoral system has led to create division among the politicians of same party. They viewed that the electoral system which creates divisions among the members of same party needs to be changed immediately.
The Mahanayake Theras of the Three Nikayas made these decisions following a discussion held at the auditorium of Palipana Sri Chandrananda School of the Asgiriya Maha viharaya in Kandy.
The Mahanayake of Asgiriya Chapter Most Ven.Warakagoda Gnanarathana Thera, Mahanayake of Ramannya Maha Nikaya Most Ven. Napane Premasiri Thera,
Mahanayake of Amarapura Maha Nikaya and Chief incumbent of Dharmapalaramaya, Mount Lavinia Most Ven Kotugoda Dhammawasa Thera and the Anunayake Thera of Malwathu Asgiriya Chapters were present.
The Mahanayake Theras also decided to hand over a letter to the President urging the government to provide early to the SAITM issue and prevent sacrilege of archeological monuments of national and cultural and religious interests on July 6.
Anunayake of the Asgiriya Chapter Most Ven.Anamaduwe Dhammadassi Thera said that the International Convention for the Protection of All Persons from the Enforced Disappearance Bill should not be brought before Parliament as it would create an atmoshphere through which the service personnel who liberated the country from the clutches of terrorism could be prosecuted and punished.
