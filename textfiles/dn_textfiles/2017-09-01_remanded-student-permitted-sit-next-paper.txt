Remanded student permitted to sit for next paper

Chemistry paper leak:
The student who was remanded for allegedly leaking the 2017 GCE Advanced Level Chemistry paper using technical devices has sought court permission to sit the examination paper scheduled on September 4.
The lawyers appearing for the student in a motion pleaded that their client needs to sit for another paper which is scheduled on September 4. Gampaha Magistrate D. A. Ruwanpathirana ordered the court registrar to make the Mahara prisons superintendant aware of this request in writing.
As the case is fixed for hearing on September 4, the Magistrate ordered the suspect be produced in court on the same day after the examination. Five persons including a tuition master are in custody in connection with printing and distributing a part of Chemistry paper in a form of a handbill while students around the country were answering the paper in examination halls.
