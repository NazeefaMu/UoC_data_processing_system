Rising from the ashes

Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe who was sworn in as Prime Minister for a record fifth time on Sunday lost no time in getting down to business. Addressing the nation immediately after taking oaths, Premier Wickremesinghe flagged off the single most important task confronting them -that of pulling the nation out of the ashes of the political conflagration of the last 50 days.
In a brief address delivered from Temple Tress, Prime Minister Wickremesinghe said their first task will be to bring the country back to normalcy and establish the status quo. He did not fail to express his gratitude to all citizens who voiced their unequivocal demand for the restoration of democracy at the height of the political crisis, including protestors, social activists and UNP supporters who carried out their struggle to all parts of the country. He also expressed his gratitude to the Supreme Court, Speaker Karu Jayasuriya and Parliament for their steadfastness in protecting democracy. He said the first thing they want to achieve is to restore normalcy and kick start development. He also promised to provide better living conditions and to create a prosperous economy for the people despite the serious economic setback that the country had to face due to the political crisis.
The Premier noted that development activities in the country came to a standstill during the last few weeks. They had come to a stage where the Government was in a position to grant the people the dividends for their labour of having to endure hardships during the past three years to bring the country to a stable level. "This was very unfortunate. We all want to lead normal lives. We want development”.
Of course, like the Prime Minister implied, this was not a time to have recriminations. True, a grave mistake was committed that placed the country in peril, both in terms of its democratic future and the repercussions on the economy (the cost to the country as result of the crisis has been estimated at over Rs 220 billion). The blow suffered to the image of the country internationally has not been quantified in economic terms but certainly the cost in terms of goodwill will be difficult to shake off. We say this because soon after the advent of the Yahapalanaya Government, Sri Lanka was hailed in the most flattering terms by nations that had hitherto spurned us. The reception accorded to President Maithripala Sirisena at the G20 meeting in Japan where President Barack Obama, it was said, broke way from a meeting of world leaders to come up to President Sirisena to greet the latter was testament to this. So was the visit to the country of a US Secretary of State for the first time in four decades. Why this goodwill was sullied by such a rash decision taken by the President all of a sudden on October 26 is indeed difficult to comprehend.
But now that the status quo has been restored, there is no purpose served in apportioning blame. The nation has to pick up the pieces and move on. The President has expressed his willingness to work with the current dispensation. Premier Wickremesinghe, for his part, showed no hint of the acrimony that existed between them post-October 26. Senior UNPers returning after the swearing, in their limousines, responding to the media, said the parties decided to bury the hatchet while reiterating the hackneyed phrases of there no being permanent friends or enemies in politics.
Of course Premier Wickremesinghe is too mature a politician to allow petty differences stand in the way of seizing on the larger picture. His priority now is to get the country going. No time should be lost in appointing the new Cabinet of Ministers to catch up on the backlog. A backlog there certainly was, what with the entire state machinery semi-paralyzed and senior officials not committing themselves to their tasks fearing repercussions.
The first task of the new Cabinet should be to get the wheels of administration moving and all services hitherto lying in abeyance fully restored.
It is not clear at this stage if the UNF is planning to go it alone or there will another coalition in store. The Greens, at least the young Turks in the party, are determined that they won't have any more alliances. The UPFA/SLFP pohottuwa combine too are not enamoured by such a prospect although UPFA General Secretary MP Mahinda Amaraweera said a final decision will be taken by the President.
Whatever may be the final decision, it is incumbent for both camps to work towards bringing the country back to normalcy. It goes without saying that the economy had been dealt a body blow by the crisis, with the rupee in a runway downward spiral against the dollar and foreign capital fleeing from the country going by the massive pullout by foreigners from the bourse.
This, therefore, is not the time for political games and both parties should declare a truce, at least until such time the country can afford the luxury of divisive party politics.
