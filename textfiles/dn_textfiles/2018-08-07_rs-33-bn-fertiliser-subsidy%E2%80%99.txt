Rs. 33 bn for fertiliser subsidy’

The government has allocated Rs. 33 billion for the fertiliser subsidy this year, Agriculture State Minister Wasantha Aluvihare said.
The State minister was speaking at a ceremony to inaugurate an irrigation development project in the Galewela Pradeshiya Sabha in Matale under the government’s initiative to develop 1,000 irrigation tanks covering 1,000 villages.
The State minister said it was a weakness of the government that it could not effectively communicate to the people the positive work the government has undertaken for the people’s welfare over the past three and half years.
“This government initiated an insurance scheme for all farmers in the country.
This is a huge achievement for the farming community. No former government had come up with such a scheme,” he said.
The State minister said paddy will be purchased at a stable price during the Yala season.
