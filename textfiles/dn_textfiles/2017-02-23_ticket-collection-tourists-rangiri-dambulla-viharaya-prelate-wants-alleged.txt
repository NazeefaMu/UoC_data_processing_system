Ticket collection from tourists at Rangiri Dambulla Viharaya: Prelate wants alleged misappropriation probed

If a sum of Rs. 7,300 million to Rs. 10,950 million accrued from the sale of tickets to visitors at the Rangiri Dambulla Viharaya over the past two decades have been misappropriated as alleged, an immediate investigation should be conducted into it and legal action taken against those responsible, irrespective of their status or position,
Viharadhipathi and member the Asgiriya Chapter Karaka Sangha Sabha Ven. Dr. Godagama Mangala Thera said. The Thera said if the temple had suffered neglect, the responsibility for it should be borne by the Commissioner of Buddhist Affairs, Archaeological Department and the Culture Triangle Project which were responsible for its consecration work. The Thera said the Rangiri Dambulla Viharaya was proclaimed a world heritage site very recently. But, earlier this historic place of workshop was maintained by the Maha Sangha of the Asgiriya Maha Viharaya without any problem.
