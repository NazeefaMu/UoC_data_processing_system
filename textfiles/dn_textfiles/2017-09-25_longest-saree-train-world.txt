Longest saree train in the world

A Sri Lankan bride set the world record of carrying the longest saree train in the world on September 22. Sajini Priyangika who wed Ruwan Pushpakumara wore a Kandyan style saree (Osariya) which had a 3200 meter long train. Around 250 school children from a state owned school carried the train as the couple walked down a main road in the central district of Kandy.
The bride’s saree train was perceived by the Guinness team as it was spread from Gatambe junction to Iriyagama junction along the Gannoruwa road. Indramala Rajapaksa has dressed the bride while the saree was provided by Manjula Tilakaratne of Mala Saree Centre. Central Province chief Minister Sarath Ekanayake was a guest at the event. Around 40 flower girls too took part in the wedding ceremony.
The previous record for the longest saree train was held by an Indian woman. It was 2800 meters long.
