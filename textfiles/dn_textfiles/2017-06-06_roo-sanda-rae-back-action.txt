Roo Sanda Rae back in action

Musical duo Rookantha Gunatileke and Chandralekha Perera will be holding the Roo Sanda Rae concert once again this year in Australia and New Zealand. The concert will feature their two daughters Raini and Windy. It is after two years that all four members of the family will take to the stage.
Concerts will be held in Melbourne on June 10, Adelaid on June 11, Brisbane on June 17 and Perth on 24. All the tickets to the concert were sold out within 12 days after they were made available to the public.
Therefore there is talk of holding two concerts in Melbourne. Kelum Srimal will compere the events. Suresh Maliyadde and team will provide the music. Malaka Yapa had coordinated the events.
