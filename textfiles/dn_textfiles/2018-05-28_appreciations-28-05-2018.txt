[APPRECIATIONS - (28-05-2018)]

I. M. R. Wijetunge
True gentleman
Ivor Malcolm Reginald Wijetunge was born on June 1, 1918, at Turret Road, (currently known as Srimath Anagarika Dharmapala Mawatha), Colombo 3. His father was Edmund Perera Wijetunge of Gandara Walawwa; C. B. E. Crown Proctor, J. P. U. M. Solicitor and Dondra Vishnu Devale Basnayake Nilame, while his mother was Lilian Adeline Winifred De Fonseka Pieris (granddaughter of Hannadige Jeronis Pieris and Warusahannadige Carolina Francisca Soysa). He spent his childhood with two brothers, Percival and Ronald and sister Mahanil at Brown’s Hill, Matara; a colonial residence built by his father in the early 1900’s.
Educated at Royal College, Colombo, from 1928 to 1937, Ivor was an ardent philatelist, having one of the best stamp collections in Sri Lanka consisting of many rare first edition stamps. Ivor also engaged in playing table tennis and participated in athletics during his college days.
He read for his BA through the University of London External Programme from 1937 to 1941 and was called to the Bar on April 5, 1944, following the family tradition of practicing law as done by his father and brother Percival. He had a thriving practice at the Matara, Tangalle and Hambantota courts and also appeared before the Colombo Court of Appeal and the Supreme Court on Civil Matters.
He married Lois De Silva and was blessed with five children; Krishanthi, Samanthi, Sharmini, Rajiva and Newaree. Carrying on her father’s legacy, Krishanthi also chose law as her profession, achieving first place in the Attorney-At-Law Final Examination in 1977. She practised as an Attorney-At-Law and was a lecturer in the Law Faculty of the University of Colombo.
Ivor was appointed the first President’s Counsel for the Southern Province on October 20, 1983; his proudest achievement. Having practiced at the Bar for a period of 49 years, he passed away on June 12, 1993.
As a way to honour Ivor and his legacy in the field of law, four of his grandchildren, Arvin, Shevanti (Shevy), Dilhara (Dilly) and Janani chose law as their profession. Other noteworthy lawyers in the family include Vernon Wijetunge QC, Justice Ninian Jayasuriya and Percival Wijetunge.
Grandpapa, as we all called him, was a true gentleman, a devout husband and father to his wife and children and doted on all his grandchildren equally. He selflessly gave his time to clients on a pro-bono basis and always had a patient ear for anyone’s problems. He would let me sit in during his consultations with clients during my younger days, which initated my love for law and the desire to be like him when I grew up. He was a great influence in the lives of his children and grandchildren and we all miss him dearly each and every day.
Granpappa, May you attain the Supreme Bliss of Nibbana!

Prof. Samantha Hettiarachchi
Devout Buddhist
Just a month has passed by since the demise of Professor Samantha Hettiarachchi. Having been a pioneer in teaching coastal engineering in Sri Lanka both at undergraduate and postgraduate levels, in the early 1980’s, Professor Samantha Hettiarchchi carried out an extensive project on the behaviour of the Kalu ganga outfall, which traversed from one end of the sand bar to the other regularly, causing certain resistance to the river’s flow.
His observations were made known in one of his first research papers presented jointly with me in 1983 at the International Coastal Engineering Conference.
A past president of the Institution of Civil Engineers in London, on receiving the sad news, sent a message stating “...I see Sam as a young and energetic man with many years left in him. What a tragedy for Sri Lanka...”
His interests and entry into the field of coastal engineering has been memorable, with its summit being him holding the position of Acting Vice Chairman of the Steering Group of the Indian Ocean Tsunami Warning and Mitigation System under the auspices of the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation (UNESCO).Samantha was a devout Buddhist, while respecting all other religions.
His late mother and wife were faithful Christians and he had a solid background in a leading Christian school by the sea, being its Head Prefect as well.
During the initial stages of his postgraduate Coastal Engineering career, he carried out a survey of the performance of the fisheries harbours around the island.
He had a liking for all sorts of fountain pens from various countries. A couple of years ago, when I complained about the difficulties I faced in finding a replacement for a matching silver-plated pencil, it did not take much time for him to get me an identical replacement which since then, I carry with me always; it serves as a remembrance of him. May he rest from his devoted invaluable contributions to the academic and professional fields and above all, to the development of youth.

Chandra Lal De Alwis
Excellent entrepreneur
I was saddened to learn of the passing away of Chandra Lal De Alwis, former Managing Director/CEO of Chemanex Ltd and one of the most successful entrepreneurs/technocrats that I had ever come across. Lal departed from the world, leaving a permanent void in the hearts of everyone associated with the rubber and chemical industries in Sri Lanka. His demise marks the end of an era of 40 years as a high-profile entrepreneur, encompassing the rubber and agro-based industry in the country.
My association with Lal commenced in the late 1970’s, when the sole supplier of the bleaching agent namely RPA 3 that was used to make water-white latex crepe rubber, the Du Pont Company, a leading chemical manufacturer in USA, suddenly announced its withdrawal from the market owing to health and safety reasons. This announcement was a bolt which posed a threat to the rubber estates in the country who were the sole suppliers of this premium-grade rubber to the whole world. There was no alternate chemical available to be used for this purpose.
The Plantation Industries Minister at that time gave a deadline to scientists attached to the Rubber Research Institute (RRI), to discover an alternate chemical to be used for this purpose within three months. Even though this directive was an impossible task to be accomplished within three months, we the scientists of the RRI, took this challenge with a grit of determination and invented a chemical which is now available in the market to be used in the printing ink manufacturing industry, capable of bleaching pigments in rubber latex, thereby making the rubber produced a pure white colour.
However, this new product had inherent drawbacks at the time of its introduction to the market. It was available as a solution in petroleum oil and it also had an foul smell, exposing the workers handling the chemical to giddiness and other health hazards. According to the World Health Organisation, it was carcinogenic. Hence, the scientific community at the RRI worked to resolve this challenge and convert the new chemical to a water-soluble form, which was easy to handle and free of health hazards.
Lal De Alwis, who was the General Manager of Chemanex Ltd at the time, took a decision to help the RRI implement the new chemical to the crepe rubber industry, facing various challenges by the distributors of oil-based chemicals. Thanks to his efforts, the RRI was able to substitute this new safe chemical manufactured by Chemanex Ltd in the crepe industry, paving the way for the RRI to win the Institute of Chemistry Gold Medal in 1985 and later, the Presidential Award for Research.
He was a devout Buddhist who held numerous positions at temples and other social organisations. I had the privilege of learning the rudiments of facing challenges in marketing, thanks to the support and advice I received from him.
Lal was honest and also courageous and objective in his endeavours.
His death is an irreplaceable loss to the rubber industry and to all Sri Lankans as well.
May he attain the Supreme Bliss of Nirvana.
Dr. L. M. K. Tillekaratna, Former RRI Director

Kumari Rambodagalle
A wonderful individual
I came to know Kumari when our children went abroad for their studies. We met often and soon, became good friends. Kumari was a wonderful person; helpful and kind. she was a faithful wife to her husband, Upali and a loving mother to her two children Malinka and Savinki, who later became doctors.
When Kumari, on that fateful day, called me early morning to ask my son to book an angiogram for her, little did I know that it would be the last call I would receive from her.
I miss you very much.

Kusumsiri Gunawardena
She was courageous
I remember a person who had never changed her rightful decisions as her decisions were always rational. Where she saw injustice, she was rough as a storm; and before justice, she was a lioness. Not considering whether she would win a person’s vote, she would be outspoken of her decisions, clearly justifying them in front of anyone.
Kusumsiri Gunawardena was born the youngest of eight children for Magalle Kachchiyawatte Sopinona and Don David Amarasinghe (who was a pioneer in civil contracts.
She had a warm and an understanding heart towards the poor. Kusumsiri was educated at Sri Rahula Buddhist School, but since it was considered as an incomplete education without English, her parents decided her to be educated at the Matara Convent. After four years, as her parents were not satisfied with her education, she was educated later at Musaeus College in Colombo.
Vivianne Gunawardena (niece of late Phillip Gunawardena) and Caroline (Sister of Phillip Gunawardena), were her schoolmates. The straightforward ideas of hers infused with the both of them and they were at in their senior years when the Buddhist nationalist agitation intensified; this was in the early 1930’s.
Ex-serviceman Aelien Perera, encouraged by Terrance N. De Zylva who foresaw the invasion of the imperialists, set in motion a crusade to sell sooriyamal flowers in commemoration of the veterans who lost their lives in redeeming the country from its invaders, in opposition to the sale of poppy flowers as in western customs.
Young Kusuma, always seen with plaited hair and seated with a smart outlook, won the hearts of her friends as well as her teachers. Her brother Dr. C. D. Amarasinghe was responsible in her affairs with the passing away of her beloved father in 1920.
With the birth of the Sama Samaja Party in 1935, the three ladies Caroline, Kusuma and Vivianne were seen at anti-imperialist rallies. At most meetings, unlike Robert Gunawardena, Phillip Gunawardena’s speeches were fiery and bright, with flares of power being one of the most powerful speakers in the country’s history. He, who spoke last at times, transformed the minds of the public.
On June 30, 1939, she took Phillip Gunawardena’s hand, witnessed by Susantha de Fonseka and Dr. Colvin R. de Silva. She extended her fullest support to her husband in numerous ways, be it political, domestic or otherwise since then. On June 18, 1940, when Phillip Gunawardena along with Dr. N. M. Perera and the others, were incarcerated without trial or questioning for campaigning against the British, young Kusuma was a frequent visitor to the Weilikada Prison to encourage her husband.
When they broke out of jail and went into hiding in India, she too joined them, disguised as a student with Sam Silva by the Talaimannar train. They were arrested on July 15, 1943, by Indian Police and she was later deported to Sri Lanka with her eldest son Indika. Phillip Gunawardena, deprived of his seat at Avissawella due to an incident in Mount Lavinia, was sentenced to a six-month imprisonment.
In 1947, under the Soulbury government, Phillip Gunawardena lost seat in Parliament and Kusumsiri was elected to parliament. She was the first parliamentarian to deliver a speech in Sinhala. In 1952, she won the Avissawella seat and in 1956, while Phillip Gunawardena won the seat with over 22,000 votes, she won the Kiriella seat with over 9,000 votes against her opponent. In 1960, she lost her seat at Kiriella. Later, she gave up her political career after she lost in 1956, 1967 and 1970, while contesting for the Kolonnawa seat.
I could remember her strong image dressed always in a white saree. I believe as a mother, she brought up her children to an incompatible, rebellious migration for a precise, socialist environment. She was a sincere revolutionary who argued for just cause of the legitimate workers’ rights.
Though never advertised, she would always use all Sri Lankan products and prepare food with her own hands, sans aid from servants. She involved herself in politics and all home chores were handled by her herself. She possessed stormy and straightforward personality who opened herself to anyone genuinely.
This was my effort in making aware of her story in short to younger generations; to let them know who she was and the courageous heart and patriotic blood she possessed.
May she attain the Supreme Bliss of Nirvana!
