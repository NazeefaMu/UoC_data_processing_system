Crop damage due to rains:
Compensation for big onion farmers

Agriculture Minister Mahinda Amaraweera had instructed Agrarian Insurance Board (AIB) officials to grant compensation for big onion farmers in Dambulla who lost their cultivation due to heavy rains.
The minister also instructed AIB officials to submit a comprehensive report on this within a week. Heavy rains started a few days before harvesting which ruined big onion harvests in Dambulla.
With the new crop insurance scheme implemented under the guidance of President Maithripala Sirisena, the AIB has decided to pay a compensation of Rs. 100,000 per hectare of big onion cultivated lands.
The new insurance scheme has been introduced for six varieties of crops including paddy, from Maha season 2018, without a premium from farmers.
Under the new crop insurance system introduced by the AIB, farmers can claim up to Rs. 40,000 for one acre or Rs. 100,000 per hectare of paddy, maize, big onion, potato, soya bean and green chili cultivations. The government has allocated funds totaling Rs. 5.228 billion to the respective banks.
The minister encourages farmers to grow the listed crops without fear of crop damage.
He assured that the government will take steps to protect the farmer community when the harvest is not sold or damaged.
