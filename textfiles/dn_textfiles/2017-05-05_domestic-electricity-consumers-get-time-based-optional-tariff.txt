Domestic electricity consumers to get time based optional tariff

The Public Utilities Commission of Sri Lanka (PUCSL), the electricity sector regulator, approved a time based, optional tariff, for the single phase domestic consumers, which was earlier limited only for the consumers who have three phase connections and consuming 30A or above, PUCSL said issuing release yesterday.
The release adds: "The time of use (TOU) tariff was identified as it would benefit for the domestic users and aims to demote power usage during the peak time and promote power usage during the off peak time. "The decision came into light sighting the observation of an increasing fleet of electric vehicles (EV) in Sri Lanka and the increase of the peak demand on account of their charging load.
"Proposing the tariff change, Ceylon Electricity Board said, the studies undertaken by western utilities have found that uncontrolled natural consumer behaviour for vehicle charging invariably contributes to the evening peak.
“The world is driving towards more clean and efficient use of energy and most of the countries are in the process of electrifying the transport sector encouraging the energy efficiency. Considering the facts of energy efficiency and environmentally friendliness, a big wave has been created by people in moving towards electric vehicles around the world.
The extension of ToU tariff to the single phase domestic users plans to encourage energy efficiency and will benefit by the EV users in Sri Lanka, where they can charge their vehicles at a lower cost,” PUCSL Director General Damitha Kumarasinghe said."
