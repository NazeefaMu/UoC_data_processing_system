Most sixes conceded by a bowler in a Twenty20 International

No bowler wants to watch his deliveries sent out of the fence but Yuzvendra Chahal was hit for as many as seven sixes in the 2nd T20I game in Centurion. The leg-spinner took the trashing from the South African batsmen as he conceded 64 runs in his four overs without any success.
Chahal, who is known for his braveness in bowling attacking line, was hit for as many as 41 runs in 12 balls by Heinrich Klaasen in the game. The home team chased down 189 banking on fifties from Klaasen and JP Duminy to level the series.
Beginning from the last year’s ‘A’ team triangular series in South Africa, Klaasen made 110 runs against Chahal in 74 balls with six fours and eight sixes. The Indian bowler claimed the wicket of Klaasen only once in seven innings they faced off.
The South African wicket-keeper hit three sixes in Chahal’s first two overs and two in a row in the 3rd over. JP Duminy hit one more six in that over which yielded them 23 runs while Farhaan Behardien hit one in the final over of the leg-spinner. With those seven sixes, Chahal became the first Indian to conceded seven sixes in a T20I game.
Ravindra Jadeja conceded six sixes in the 2010 WT20 game against Australia despite bowling only two overs. He was taken on for three consecutive sixes on the last three balls of his first over and three more maximums on the first three deliveries of his second over which turned out to his last as well. Jadeja and Chahal conceded five sixes in a T20I innings during last year’s matches while Stuart Binny was hit for five sixes in the record high-scoring game in Lauderhill in 2016.
Chahal’s seven sixes in this game are also the joint-most number of sixes conceded by a bowler in a T20I match. Four players other than Chahal have achieved this unwanted feat with the last one being Andrew Tye during the recent high-scorer against New Zealand at the Eden Park in Auckland. Stuart Broad was the first player to enter the list after being hit for sixes in an over he bowled to Yuvraj Singh in the 2007 WT20 match in Durban. - CT
