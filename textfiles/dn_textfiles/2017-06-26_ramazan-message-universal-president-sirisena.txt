Ramazan message is universal: President Sirisena

 
The contemporary human being suffering from limitless greed, is engaged in a journey of unending desire for material wealth. This devastating behaviour has influenced to create disunity and mistrust among people and spread unease among them, states President Maithripala Sirisena in a Ramazan message.
Mutual respect, equality, sacrifice and helping the poor which are practiced in society during the month of Ramalan, which is practiced by the entire Muslim community with utmost devotion, shows that the emancipation of humans depends not on self-interest, but on the feeling of the others’ welfare.
“Accordingly, the message conveyed to humanity through Ramalan or Eid-ul-fitr celebration is universal in its manifest. It expects everybody to be fair to all, based on religious, spiritual and social ideals. The rituals of Ramalan remind us that humanity can be improved by being sensitive to the others’ sentiments, while being honest to ourselves. “I extend my best wishes to all Islam devotees who celebrate the Eid-ul-fitr, which has such meaningful vision that addresses the common humanity by exceeding religious limitations.
