OL exam impersonator caught on ninth attempt

Examination Department sources said a person was arrested while sitting the Ordinary Level examination with a forged identity card at an examination centre in Piliyandala.
The person was answering the Geography examination papers after impersonating a student when arrested.
Police sources revealed that the suspect had pasted his picture on the National Identity Card (NIC) belonging to the student he was impersonating. At a first glance the bogus identity card cannot be identified as it has been much similar to a normal identity card. However, he has managed to answer eight examination papers using this bogus identity card until he was arrested yesterday.
Invigilators on duty took the 25-year-old suspect into their custody and later handed him over to the Piliyandala Police. The Examinations Department will conduct an inquiry in this regard.
