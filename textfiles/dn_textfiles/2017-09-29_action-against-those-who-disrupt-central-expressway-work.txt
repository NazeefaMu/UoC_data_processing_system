Action against those who disrupt Central Expressway work

 
The Road Development Authority (RDA) stated that legal action would be taken against the protestors who disrupt the work of the Central Expressway.
 RDA Chairman Nihal Suriyarachchi in a press statement said today that a protest campaign has been orchestrated by a small group with the motivation to disrupt the work of the Expressway from Meerigama to Kurunegala.  
He observed that even the people who received compensation by the Government have involved in the protests and have become political lackeys.
 He said the RDA lodged a complaint at the Kurunegala Police on Wednesday over these protests organized with vested interests and a court order has been issued on Thursday to take legal action against any obstructer.
He added the RDA would strictly follow this order. 
 The RDA, pointing out that the Central Expressway is an important development project of the Government that gives multiple benefits to the people in the area, requested the full support of the people to continue its work.
