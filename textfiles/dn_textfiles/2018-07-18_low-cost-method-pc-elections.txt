Low-cost method for PC Elections

A senior retired engineer friend of mine has raised a few concerns on my proposal on the above subject that appeared in the press recently. I take the liberty to enlist my responses to him for the benefit of the readers and the authorities concerned?
The proposal, in fact, calls for a robust selection procedure for preparing a ‘District Party Merit List’ for each District, based on a set of compulsory eligibility criteria laid down by the Election Commission itself followed by a scientifically structured interview process for eligible applicants by a special interview panel of the parties concerned.
This procedure should automatically make lobbying and favouritism a disqualification.
Also, any application that doesn’t meet any one of the eligibility criteria will get rejected by the returning officer during nomination time, ensuring a viable choice for the voter. A comprehensive article by the writer on the said selection procedure was also published in the press both in Sinhala and English.
It is pertinent to repeat that at much larger Provincial and National level, voters have proved to be poor electors when it comes to the election of individual candidates, as they are swayed by the offer of various goodies and wide-ranging bribes by unscrupulous candidates. Besides, voters have no thorough knowledge of the core competencies of the candidates even if they are from the electorate.
However, voter decision on which party to vote has been more rational throughout the past.
Instability in Provincial Councils
This parochial concept founded on maintaining an absolute majority in the Council for all purposes is not in keeping with the principles of a liberal democracy where a healthy debate is always welcome. ‘Hung’ or ‘unstable Councils’ will become misnomers when professionals with the country at heart deliberate and decide on the best-fine-tuned options for the Council/Parliament/country.
Campaign funding by individual candidates
Since the parties will do the selection and election of candidates (District party merit list), the entire campaign expenditure should be borne by a Centralized Party Campaign Fund (CPCF) through which ‘accountable funds’ shall be allocated to each candidate based on rational criteria evolved by the parties themselves. As a result, the contesting candidates will not be required to spend their own money. However, they can assist to raise funds which have to be channelled through the CPCF. This will also enable the Election Commission to monitor the campaign expenditure of parties methodically. The introduction of ‘District Party merit list’ will not only attract genuine contestants who are not financially strong but will also enable the Elections Department to save substantial time, money and human effort by doing away with the cumbersome counting of preference votes.
The similarity with ‘Mixed Voting system’
Even under the Mixed System, it is the party that selects the candidate for the area.
Further, in a small country saturated with a 4 tiered (Exe. President, National Parliament, 9 Provincial Councils with 9 mini-Parliaments and 9,000 strong Local Government members) political administration pyramid, the tiers can be easily charged with specific role responsibilities to avoid duplication of functions and make the system more efficient and productive. As a result, it is not compulsory for PC members to visit the local areas to identify and solve local level problems.
In such a scenario, Provincial Councillors can be confined to their roles as ‘Provincial Law/Policymakers’/monitors/implementers while the Local Govt. members would identify and feed the higher level with their necessary budgetary requirements to solve local level problems. The huge network of 14,000 strong Grama Niladaris combined with the 9,000 strong Local Govt. members is more than ample to identify and cater to the local needs which are any way declining due to advances in communication technology, systems, procedures and transport. Moreover, the print and electronic media and the NGOs have already become positive agents in identifying and in many instances even solving local level issues.
Ad hoc ratios and bonus seats
At PC and National level elections, all votes should be considered as cast by ‘Sri-Lankans’. In our view, only this concept can iron out the elusive issue of voting based on ethnicity, religion, cast etc. The application of proportionate arithmetic in a ‘cut and dry’ scientific manner, to determine the no. of seats won in a District by each party, will ensure an ‘equal value’ for each Sri Lankan vote in a District. The delimitation exercise should generate the pre-determined number of seats allocated to each District. Thus, formulae such as ad-hoc Ratios and bonus seats not scientifically founded on empirical evidence and research being mere ‘trial and error’ mechanisms, should not be used to strike a balance in a liberal democratic process of exercising voter franchise.
