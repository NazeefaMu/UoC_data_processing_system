Japan grants Rs 90 mn for de-mining

Japan’s Amabassador in Sri Lanka Kenichi Suganuma said Sri Lanka is keen to achieve its target as a landmine free country by 2020.
He praised government for efforts taken to make Sri Lanka a landmine free nation.
The Ambassador said ample opportunities have been provided for the people in conflict affected areas to start a new life.
Japan extended Rs 90 million (US$ 604,731), in grant aid for humanitarian demining in Northern Sri Lanka, under its Grant Assistance for Grassroots Human Security Project (GGP).
The project for demining in the Northern Province of Sri Lanka in Assistance of Peace Building, rehabilitation and reconciliation will be implemented by Devlon Assistance for Social Harmony (DASH) and the grant was signed between Ambassador Kenichi Suganuma and DASH Programme Manager Ananda Chandrasiri at the Embassy in Colombo.
It is expected that this project will contribute to facilitating the efforts of the Government of Sri Lanka to make mine contaminated areas safe lands for internally displaced people to return and resume their livelihood activities.
Japan, welcoming Sri Lanka’s accession to the mine - ban treaty, has decided to extend this grant to contribute to its effort for being mine-impact free by the year 2020. Being the sole donor supporting all demining NGOs in Sri Lanka, the government of Japan has provided US$ 32 million for demining activities in the North and the East under its Grant Assistance schemes since 2003.
Chandrasiri appreciated the assistance extended by Japan to Sri Lankan mine action program MW, where DASH has been continuously funded by Japan since 2010.
“Our government has further consolidated its commitment to the interminable peace in our country and in the entire world by having recently acceded to the Ottawa Treaty to ban landmines,” he said.
He further said that the Sri Lankan programmer is one of the most successful mine action stories in the world. Chandrasiri noted that DASH believes that the most important factor contributing to the peace building process of our country is the availability of livelihood opportunities to the young people, who were directly or indirectly affected by the conflict, for them to have not only a source of income but most importantly the recognition in our society is vital.
