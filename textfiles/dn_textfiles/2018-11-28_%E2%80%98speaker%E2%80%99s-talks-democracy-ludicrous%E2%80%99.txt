‘Speaker’s talks on democracy, ludicrous’

Speaker Karu Jayasuriya talking about democracy is ludicrous, former MP Dullas Alahapperuma said.
Addressing a press conference at the Prime Minister’s Office in Colombo yesterday, Alahapperuma said that only November 21 was listed on the Parliament calendar as a regular sitting day. Parliament was not scheduled to sit on any other day.
According to Alahapperuma, the people’s sovereignty has been dangerously challenged. There is no Order Paper for Parliament now and the contents of all court cases are severely distorted due to the activities of the Speaker and Parliament.
“In 2004, a similar situation arose but UNP Speaker W.J.M. Lokubandara appointed the Parliament Business Committee without being biased. In 2015, UPFA Speaker Chamal Rajapaksa appointed the Parliament Business Committee without being biased. The people should be reminded about this past history,” he said.
Alahapperuma pointed out that although the Executive President, Parliament and the country’s judiciary have 561 heads, the people are still supreme and their head count is 16 million. The people do not know about their power. The mass media should educate them about it.
MP Arundika Fernando said that the Government will ask the people of Sri Lanka for a mandate and the people will definitely give it to the Government. The people were eagerly waited to get rid of the UNP regime which made their lives very difficult.
“Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa began providing relief to the people shortly after his appointment,” he said.
MP Indika Anuruddha said that Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa did not come from the back door and the UPFA did not snatch anybody’s Government. Everything started to unfold with the publication of the COPE Report and President Maithripala Sirisena had forgiven the former Prime Minister on a number of occasions.
President Sirisena dissolved Parliament to provide an opportunity to the people to elect Mahinda Rajapaksa. Now the UNP is planning to hold rallies on ‘democracy’ at every junction spending Rs.200 million. The Government did not send any MP to Singapore to obtain money. The UNP Government robbed the Central Bank in February 2015, a month after its election to office and brought in the 19th Amendment in April in order to boost the Sirikotha Account and prevent the Rajapaksa family from contesting elections.
