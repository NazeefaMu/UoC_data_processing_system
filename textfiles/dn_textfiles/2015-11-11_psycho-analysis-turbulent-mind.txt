PSYCHO-ANALYSIS OF A TURBULENT MIND

If this is a mind gripped in moral sin, (so says the puritans) then it is a life imbibed in the intensity of ardour to oneself. Or to put it across more meaningfully; the one who is in love with him self that led Dorian Gray not as much to assess to what the end would be.
Look at it more positively;
When a strong evil power force him to be in full control of his life and transit his soul to a 'living' picture where it would take on years he leave behind. The story dose not indicate how he manipulates such a miracle.
Was it a turbulent mind or mesmerizing effects that confronting him as found in the pages. From the offset, the story looks simple but the deep dark secret that lay is incredibly challenging. Whatever the reason is, it is best left for a psychologist to determine the process of a vibrating restless mind; resplendent with the most beautiful physique and charm a man could wish for which a modern psychologist might find incapable of disentangling unless he puts his subjects under hypnotism.
But then what happens when he wakes up ?
Much of the story is drawn from ambition to challenge or 'best' life and declare his power above God or Creator or fall partly in line with the theory of evolution as discovered by Darwin that leads to cases like these even if they are fiction in the eyes of psychologists. The story begins in the raw expansive world of tension, chroniclyising the tragedy of young Dorian Gray born a scion to a riches who taste luxury at its best but left with few friends for company. But the vitality and strength of character makes him the ruler of his fate as well as that of a painter and scientist. with telling account of his momentous decisions and growing menace, he becomes a threat to those who love him. Dorian Gray rise to be the man of the moment and the citizen of the world. The confronting years under terrible pressures defining the course of his life, this 'drama' baffles science with his retaining power of age.
How ruthfully he kills ' his love.............. so akine to Hamlet who ruthfully 'drives' Ophelia to her death even though under different circumstances, is a matter of comparison.
Building his personality on the foundation of fantasy, Dorian Gray's story can be anyone's story in different shapes and male ego. With great psychological perception, one can examine the milieu in which he was shrouded, ambition to stay young on borrowed time. The volatile force that scourged his mind was his own seeking in which he wallowed. No where does it state that he attempted to peep deep into the insights that he struggled to achieve, ultimately. He was the architect of his own doing. Many who read his classic will tend to dismiss this as an agonistic visionary in today's context of literary concept that are realistic than those that emerged from perceptive power of idealism contrary to philosophers who cease to believe that this could be achieved during phase of time.
Would you?
The greatness they look forward to that Oscar Wilde experienced, never for a moment imagining to what heights this classic would impact the reader with the story he leave behind.
This study of a very normal man in turmoil with his soul given to the devil to dissect while in control of his senses with a magnificent body for post-mortem, and who had the ability to flaunt to incredible imagination which stunned his readers. With a 'Narisscian' quality to wade through life and dominate the few who rotated around his life to what he wanted to be; the people who loved him, became the very people whom he destroyed at the end both physically and mentally.
Dorian Gray is the dream of any young girl but he remained the youth he fell in love with himself and tried in vain to cheat life at its own game at the marathon end and who literary acceded with a grotesque finale.
Ever since I read The Picture Of Dorian Gray I was intrigued by human behavior.....to what extent a little mind could cope with and end in explosion. I am still at loss as to how Oscar Wilde handled a repulsive mind seeped in human drama; the pathose, anguish, passion, ardour and intensity imbibed in a painting that he presumed would never grow with age while the rest of the world around his idol, remained blossoming manhood. But the frustration it caused its creator, never did explain to me when I read the book over and over again in the decades that followed.
However, my curiosity did not kill the cat when I re-read it once again a few weeks back after brushing away the dust it had collected on its cover, staring at me, the face could well have been my dream man.
My persuit did not end there but continued to stretch over years to nose-dive into what 'gay' meant that surrounds people, celebrities and in the case of Oscar Wilde, there is a hint of it attached to Dorian Gray who falls in love with himself and reflected in the painting. Later, we were to learn about Oscar Wilde's gay activities that miserably led to his death. I was able to view these bearings more dispassionately. Some where in the recess of my mind I had an abhorance for gay people, especially the famous guys I met globe-trotting officially. I could never open up to them on their subjects. There was always the withdrawing point from where I had to cease even from a world renown literati.
After reading it again just few days ago, I felt miserable at my inability to understand why they are so near but faraway. Oscar Wilde needs to be looked upon as a wondrous human though lost at crossroads of human passion. If he was alive and kicking today and wrote his classics, he would have been hailed in higher esteem as the genius whose texts could have been sold in million because it is the fashion of the day for celebrities to be gay. He was born far behind time.
Dorian Gray was the son of love and death.
The end.
'Francis was pale as a ghost. Still, the coachman and the footman crept upstairs. The policeman and other servants followed. They knocked on the door but there was no reply.... Finally they got on the roof and dropped on to the balcony and kicked in the windows.
When they entered, they found a splendid portrait of the 20-year-old Dorian Gray with all his youth and handsome features intact. Lying on the floor was dead man with a knife in his heart. He was wrinkled and horrible to look at. It was not until the servants examined the rings on his aged fingers that they realized it was their employer.
Dorian Gray had changed places with his own painting (exits the enigma)
