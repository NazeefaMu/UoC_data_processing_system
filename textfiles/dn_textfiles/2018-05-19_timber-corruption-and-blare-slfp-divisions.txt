Timber of corruption and blare of SLFP divisions

For a government with a declared commitment to fighting corruption, the recent developments, especially with regard to the State Timber Corporation, are in no way supportive of its anti-corruption pledges and responsibilities. There are two former chairmen of the State Timber Corporation, now in remand prison, which does not speak of any teak wood strength in fighting corruption, but that of very weak timber.
The new remandee is former JVP MP Anuruddha Polgampola, who was appointed chairman of the Timber Corporation after the arrest and judicial detention of its former chairman, P. Dissanayake. Polgampola, a former JVP member, later a supporter of President Mahinda Rajapaksa, and still later, current President Maithripala Sirisena, was appointed chairman of the Timber Corporation after its previous head was swiftly interdicted, following his involvement in the huge corruption scandal of the former Chief of Staff of the President’s Office. The issue here is that Polgampola succeeding Dissanayake was due to an appointment by the President. He too was removed from that office no sooner the allegations about his corrupt activities involving immigration went public. Very timely indeed. But it is now known he was involved in a serious case of corruption, before the Courts, and had avoided the Courts on two occasions.
What is most regrettable here is that amidst policy declarations of fighting corruption, the current situations are pointing fingers at the President, who is the Head of State and Government, giving ample opportunities for critics of both him and the government to make charges on the lack of a serious commitment to fight corruption, and even worse that this government is closely associated with the corrupt. If you look at the longer record, it is seen that three successive Chiefs of Staff of the President’s Office – under three presidents - have been remanded for alleged corruption charges. It seems a continuing record of corruption, which certainly needs a stronger fight. What is of more importance now is to make sure that the Office of the President, pays more and serious attention to knowing the background of people who are recommended or seek important appointments in the State sector; and bring the necessary information to the notice of the President, before any appointments are made. The background checks on appointees to higher positions than routine office and management duties, should be certainly deeper, sharper and swifter, to prevent the President from making such appointments, that could be disastrous to the image of the government and its leadership.
SLFP clamour
Being part of the government, part of the Joint Opposition and ‘independents’ in the Opposition benches, has led to a cacophony of demands by the new SLFP independent group. The Central Committee of the SLFP will begin discussions on party reforms this week. The 16 member independent group has tabled a proposal for the SLFP to leave the ‘unity government’ and be part of the Opposition, which their own members know will not be decided very soon, as S. B. Dissanayake has told the Daily Mirror this week. They are keen to get the other members of the party, still in the government, and holding ministerial office too, to quit with speed and join their ranks in the Opposition benches. But, this too seems a lot of noise just now, with little signs of realization.
The SLFP’s dissonance has much to do with the next presidential election and the candidate for the Executive Presidency. The ‘Opposition Bench 16’ remain supportive of President Sirisena being the SLFP’s candidate of the next presidential poll. It is certainly difficult for them to say anything else, especially after President Sirisena said he does not intend to retire from politics by 2020.
Their major concern is to bring about unity within the party, which they see as a necessity to bring about a ‘left wing progressive’ presidency, or such a candidacy, at the next presidential poll. They certainly see the strength of the SLPP led by Mahinda Rajapaksa, but are worried by the divisions within the party, especially the absence of support from Maithripala Sirisena, which may not give it the majority of the Sinhala votes the party needs, for a presidential victory. A key part of their campaigning is to overcome the differences between President Sirisena and Mahinda Rajapaksa, for a stronger and wider unity, not yet an easy task.
Sibling saga
They are aware of the huge victory the SLPP and Mahinda Rajapaksa obtained at the February 10 Local Government Poll. But, also aware that it would not be repeated in the next presidential poll because Mahinda Rajapaksa will not be a candidate, prevented by law from seeking another presidential term.
The increasing babble within the SLFP has much to do with the choice of the next presidential candidate - and especially which sibling of Mahinda Rajapaksa it will be – Gotabhaya, Basil or Chamal. Gotabhaya, the former Secretary of Defence, did make a strong case in the recent Viyathmaga Convention at the Shangri-la, where a near manifesto of the next presidential poll was presented, under the theme – An Intellectually Inspired Sri Lanka. Intellectual inspiration or not, the draw remains his role in the defeat of the LTTE. There are concerns whether he would be able to last the non-arrest capability for as long as the next presidential poll by 2020.
Basil, who is mainly responsible for the organisation of the SLPP – Pohottuva, is seen as a distant call, with questionable issues of popularity. Chamal, the elder of the three, has an increasing following among the SLFP organisers and the allied parties of the Joint Opposition, due to his quiet nature and the absence of any allegations of corruption. The SLFP will certainly move into more and stronger debate over the candidate, with background doubts about the consequences of the possible candidacy of Maithripala Sirisena, although considered very much in the doubt. A party that has moved very much from the policies of its founder SWRD Bandaranaike, still has voices that seek a ‘left wing progressive’ policies, underscored by opposition to the UNP, World Bank, IMF, the Western world, and free market economics. In the continuing contentions within the party, are increasing voices of concern about ‘family dominance’. They do not oppose the Mahinda Rajapaksa leadership, but the possibility of a sibling being Executive President, when he is prime minister, as widely expected, does raise issues, whether such family dominance would be acceptable to the voters, especially with a Viyathmaga package. There are also quiet expressions that Mahinda Rajapaksa himself may not be too happy with such a situation, in the context of the constitutional controls of the 19th Amendment.
The SLFP will certainly move on to wider and deeper debate on the politics and personalities of the executive presidency in the coming weeks.
Issue of 19A
As the discussion over the JVP’s proposal to bring in a 20th Amendment to the Constitution moves on, with increasing doubts about the ability to obtain a two-thirds majority, after the 16 SLFPers went to opposition benches, there are also increasing discussions, especially among SLFP and SLPP politicians and strategists of the need to do away with the 19th Amendment. SB Dissanayake has in fact accused Jayampathy Wickremaratne, who is involved with the constitutional amendments process, of being supportive of a dictatorial Prime Minister through the 19A.
The issue here is the necessity for clear unity between the SLFP and SLPP, or the coming together of both parties, at the next General Election in 2020, to get a sufficiently large majority in Parliament, to do away with 19A. Some strategists and academics supportive of doing away with the policies of January 2015, see in such a majority, the possibility to remove the two term limit for the Executive President, go back to the Mahinda Rajapaksa’s 18th Amendment, and even give bigger and wider powers to the Executive President, leading to a major shift in the political process in the country. The concern of those who are thinking of making this a rallying call in the next presidential poll, is the need for minority votes in substantial numbers to have such an amendment adopted. Current trends show that a majority Sinhala-Buddhist vote alone would not see the success of such a move. But, some of the strategists and academics do think that if situations with regard to ethnic relations could be moved away from the polices or talk of reconciliation, and more keener differences with the minorities encouraged, it could lead to a situation where a bigger Sinhala-Buddhist support could be obtained to carry out the necessary constitutional changes.
The differences within the SLFP, and the not so concealed differences within the UNP, with questions of leadership and party organisational changes gaining importance in both parties, the political planning and debates are fast moving to the next presidential election, with the possibility of constitutional changes that may take the country back from 2015 and not forward from 2020.
