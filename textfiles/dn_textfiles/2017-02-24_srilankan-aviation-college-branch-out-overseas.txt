We want to bring in more quality to our aircraft maintenance course and not many people know about our aircraft maintenance training course which is a two year course in which we also specialize and is the only one in the region accredited by EASA,” he said. De Silva said they have come to an agreement with the national carrier to provide two years on the job training which was never heard in any part of the world where a student who does an aircraft maintenance basic course is given the opportunity to get a two year on the job training which leads to the student’s automatic license.
After obtaining that experience the world opens up to them, De Silva said.
