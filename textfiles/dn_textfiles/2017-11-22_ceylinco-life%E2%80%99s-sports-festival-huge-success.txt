Ceylinco Life’s Sports Festival, a huge success

Sporting prowess came to the fore recently when 3,200 employees and sales officers of Ceylinco Life took to the field at the 2017 edition of the company’s sports festival.
The athletics segment of the festival was worked out at the Mahinda Rajapaksa International Stadium in Diyagama, after the life insurance leader’s cricket, volleyball and netball tournaments were concluded a few days before the main event.
The 11th in the series of Ceylinco Life Sports Festivals conducted for staff and sales teams from every district of Sri Lanka, this year’s event saw competitors from eight groups vying for track and field honours.
The competion events included 100m, 200m, 400m, 800m and 1500m races for men and women, 100x4 and 400x4 relays, a 800m walking race, as well as a tug-o-war and a 100x4 relay for heads of branches.
At the end of a day of spirited competition, the ‘JJ’ and ‘RU’ groups shared honours as joint champions for 2017. Teams from the ‘JJ’ group won the volleyball and the netball tournaments, while the ‘ST’ and ‘LB’ groups won the Men’s and the Women’s cricket tournaments.
