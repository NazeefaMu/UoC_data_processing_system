Favoured flavours

The Galadari Hotel will celebrate its 33rd anniversary on October 6. The hotel has organized many special events and celebrations to coincide with this date. The management of the hotel has taken this special opportunity to organize an all-night ‘Pirith’ on October 8 for staff and their family members in remembrance of colleagues who lost their lives in the October 15, 1997 WTC attack as well as those colleagues who departed under other tragic circumstances. In addition to this a special multi religious service will be organized on October 9.
The hotel hopes to celebrate its anniversary in style this year with a special anniversary cake being on offer at the Café 64 until October 31. A grand “Anniversary Dinner Buffet” will take place on October 6 at the Coffee Shop from 7 pm to 11 pm. On the same day the California Grill will be offering a spectacular anniversary set menu for dinner. The Indian restaurant Flavours has a special dinner offer and the hotel’s popular pub the Margarita Blue has organised an anniversary weekend from October 6 to 8 as it too celebrates 13 fabulous years of operations to further heighten the celebrations.
