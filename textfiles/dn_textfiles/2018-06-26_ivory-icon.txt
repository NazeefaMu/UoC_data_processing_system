Ivory Icon

Pasquelge Don Augustine Ivor Dennis made his radio debut in the 1950s. Dennis took part in a song competition of the then Radio Ceylon. He sang one of the famous notes of the time: Sunil Santha’s Waren Heen Sare. No one dared challenge Sunil Santha who was a living legend in his own time. The maestro was confused this time. He could not make out whether it is his voice or not. If not for a small variation, the maestro would have dismissed what he heard over the radio as his own.
Once he detected that the voice does not belong to him, Sunil Santha wanted to discover and explore the origin. He discovered the Romen Catholic singer hailing from Seeduwa. That discovery led to a budding relationship between a master and a disciple.
The 1950s was an amazing decade. It was the decade that introduced originality to the rising national identity. The Bandaranaike government introduced the Sinhala-only policy. Dr Lester James Peries made an attempt to Sinhalise the cinema. Rekhava and Sandesaya are an offshoot of that attempt. In parallel with Lester James Peries, we cannot forget Sunil Santha. And in parallel with Sunil Santha, we cannot forget Ivor Dennis, for he carried on the former’s legacy this far.
On various occasions, Sunil Santha recommended his disciple. In such a backdrop, Ivor Dennis had the rare opportunity to come forward. He stood for Sunil Santha on numerous occasions. He travelled overseas (such as Japan, India, Indonesia, Italy, England and New Zealand) as well representing the leading singer of Sri Lanka. He was recognised for his vocalist capacity in a singing competition at the Asian Broadcasting Union in New Zealand in 1986. Yet he never overlooked the nitty-gritty of the career. Dennis received training as a playback singer.
Come 1958, and Ivor Dennis received his appointment as an A grade singer. As the recipient of the Best Singer for ‘Hima Kathara’ film, Dennis made a lasting impression in the film music industry with his contributions to cinematic works such as Madhura Madhu, Pancha Madhura, Ran Walawa and Seegiri Gee.
Dennis is well known for his music composed to Kurulu Paradiseye written by Thilak Sudharman Silva. Leslie Boteju’s Abhimananeeyavoo Navodeye Hiru also elevated Dennis to an upper echelon. With that fame, Dennis launched his cassette titled ‘Abhmana Gee’ in 1984.
Dennis was now gathering momentum in the industry. He was made Consultant to the Government College of Music. That position enabled him to work with another batch of greats such as WD Makuloluwa and Premasiri Khemadasa. His association with Khemadasa is noteworthy for any student of the Khemadasa chapter of Sri Lankan musicology. Dennis was often a standalone voice of the Khemadasa musicals. A number of notable works include Raja Weda, Pirinivan Mangallaya and Manasawila. Both Khemadasa and Dennis illumed beyond horizons thanks to each other.
If Sunil Santha played a pivotal role in bringing Ivor Dennis out, Fr Marcelline Jayakody did an equally instrumental role. Dennis stepped into the vocalist’s pedestal with the church music. He sang the songs of Fr Marcelline Jayakody and Fr Moses Perera (whose nephew happened to be Sunil Santha).
Ivor remained faithful to Sunil Santha as his ever obedient disciple. Dennis could be deemed as the leading Catholic singer of the country owing to his immense contribution. Following his music composition to Fr Moses’ lyrics, Dennis then went on to join the Pubuduwa in 1974 in order to syringe a new episode to the musical prayers. Two cassettes, Ape Pavulen Oba Mahimaya and Obe Wethi Rajindo, were launched as a result. Dennis shouldered the challenging task of composing music to all the tunes. All this paved the way for him to be the recipient of the OCIC award in recognition of his service to the Catholic music.
The Rasanjalie Kala Kavaya, an art circle, is a brainchild of Ivor Dennis. The art circle flourished with the participation of several leading figures such as Jackson Anthony, Ralex Ranasinghe, Leslie Boteju, Tony Ranasinghe, Kumarie Munasinghe, Malkanthie Pieris, Joe Dambulugala, K Francis, Alexis Fernando, Francis Horana and Anthony Molligoda. Dennis also sang for the songs of Fr Cyril Gamini.
Ageing did not distract him. He was very much involved in his territory. Like he was an obedient disciple to Gurudev Sunil Santha, Dennis could also produce a generation of skilled disciples.
He will be etched in our memories not only as the most outstanding disciple of Sunil Santha but also the leading vocalist of an unusual combination (patriotic songs and hymns).
“Ever thought of how you could get rich and famous in a fortnight? Play cricket? No. For that, you have to be a male and have a hair-do similar to a crow’s nest made of pieces of straw. The easiest way to become a demi god these days is to get selected as a superstar, singing other people’s songs. Is this plagiarism? Is this wrong? No. Not when it happened in the past.” Aditha Dissanayake penned these sentiments a few years ago.
Her opinion is noteworthy given the fact that most upcoming singers choose the songs of the veterans to climb the ladder of success. With Dennis, the story is different. As Dissanayake places on record, most of the incumbent generation would not have been familiar with Sunil Santha’s famous notes of the 1950s if not for Ivor Dennis.
Ivor Dennis was not into plagiarism. He was the godsend to carry on the Sunil Santha legacy for posterity.
