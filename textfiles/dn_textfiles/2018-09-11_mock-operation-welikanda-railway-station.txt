Mock operation at Welikanda Railway Station

The 4th day of the mock Field Training Exercise (FTX), 'Cormorant Strike' was held on Sunday at Welikanda Railway Station.
A mock operation was launched to demonstrate how two insurgents hiding in a train compartment can be apprehended following intelligence received by the troops under training from an informant. Two Special Forces rider teams responded in support of four urban fighting teams including foreign troops. During the mock operation, troops arrested two insurgents with minimum force but with a manoeuvrist approach.
