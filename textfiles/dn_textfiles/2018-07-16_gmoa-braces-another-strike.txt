GMOA braces for another strike

An emergency meeting of the Government Medical Officers’ Association (GMOA) Executive Committee will take place today (16) and an emergency meeting of the GMOA’s General Committee will be held on Thursday (19) to make the final decision on strike, GMOA Secretary Dr. Haritha Aluthge said.
He was addressing a press conference held at the GMOA Head Quarters in Colombo yesterday.
He said the GMOA did not receive any response for the demands they presented to the President. Dr. Aluthge said they presented their demands to the officials on several occasionsverbally and in writing. But they did not receive any response.
Not issuing the gazette notification on the minimum standards of medical education recommended by the SLMC, not responding to the proposals presented by doctors to amend tax policy, violating the National Wages Policy are some of the reasons that will led the GMOA to a strike, he said.
Signing of the Singapore FTA, delaying election for the four vacancies in the SLMC and interrupting SLMC’s functions, not solving grade promotions, not granting schools for doctors’ children and intervening in appointments and transfers in the medical administrative service and ignoring rules and regulations are the other reasons, he said.
