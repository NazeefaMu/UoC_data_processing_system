Talks between India, Lanka to finalise ETCA

The fourth round of talks between India and Sri Lanka to finalise the proposed Economic and Technical Cooperation Agreement (ETCA) began yesterday in New Delhi.
An official delegation from Sri Lanka is in Delhi to have talks with their counterparts in the Commerce and Industry Ministry in India. The three-day talks will take forward the negotiations held in the earlier rounds towards the finalisation of the agreement.
ETCA seeks to expand the scope of trade to services and technology sectors with a Free Trade Agreement (FTA) existing between the two countries.
The talks took place a day before Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe is scheduled to visit India on a working visit from today. The Prime Minister will meet his Indian counterpart Narendra Modi on Wednesday.
The progress on ETCA is likely to figure during the meeting.
