Ingiriya residents want Sathosa reopened

The Ingiriya Sathosa has been closed over a month after it was shifted to a new place.
The Sathosa outlet was shifted to a new place almost a one month ago and the customers are deprived of its service because it is close since then.
Reportedly, the monthly rental of the new place is Rs. 120,000 and the electricity bill is around Rs. 100,000. The Sathosa branch has five employees and all these together, the loss is huge.
The opening of the Sathosa branch is delayed because of its so far incomplete name board.
