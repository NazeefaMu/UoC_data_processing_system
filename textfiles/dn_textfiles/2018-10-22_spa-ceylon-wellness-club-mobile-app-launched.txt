Spa Ceylon Wellness Club  Mobile App Launched

Spa Ceylon, the World’s largest luxury Ayurveda chain, has launched their Spa Ceylon Wellness Club mobile App, offering members the convenience of fast, easy access to a world of wellness information.
The App will also provide information about Spa Ceylon’s vast portfolio of products and services, in-app spa reservations, in-app product purchases, details of spa and store locations internationally, plus access to the brand’s revamped customer rewards program as well.
Dedicated to providing “Everyday wellness, everywhere”, the app will also feature regular wellness tips and guides, special offers, online wellness consultations, invites to special wellness events and a host of other features to help enhance the well-being of the members.
“Being Sri Lanka’s foremost wellness brand we look at every possible way to integrate wellness into the lives of our customers. The app will no doubt further enhance this by providing a host of wellness benefits right at their fingertips even to the extent of customizing information and services to their specific wellness needs,” said co-founder and CEO, Shiwantha Dias.
“The app will also serve as a valuable tool to tourists as well, providing information on Sri Lanka’s heritage of Ayurveda, wellness tips when travelling and access to Spa Ceylon’s network of boutiques and Spas internationally. The second phase of the app implementation will add on multilingual communication that will no doubt make the interaction that much more user friendly across nationalities,” said co-founder, Shalin Balasuriya.
This app can be downloaded now from the App store and Google play store.
Spa Ceylon is poised to further expand its European footprint with many new locations scheduled to be opened soon, including Paris, France; Poland, Germany and more locations in Bulgaria and Eastern Europe. They expect to firmly establish their position as the ‘World’s largest Luxury Ayurveda chain’ by reaching the milestone of 100 branded outlets internationally, by mid 2019.
