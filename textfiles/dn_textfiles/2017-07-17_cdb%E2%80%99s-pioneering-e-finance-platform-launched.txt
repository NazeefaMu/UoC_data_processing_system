CDB’s pioneering e-finance platform launched

In its constant quest to reach customer service excellence, Citizens Development Business Finance PLC (CDB) launched CDBiNet, a revolutionary customer transaction online portal that takes customer convenience to higher realms.
CDBiNet, a true reflection of CDB’s continuous pursuit for convenience is an online finance platform that offers an expansive range of facilities with the simple click of a button or via your smartphone, for the very first time in Sri Lanka’s finance industry.
From enabling the opening of savings accounts and fixed deposits to utility bill payments, application for VISA debit cards, fund transfers, information on leases and loans and online payments of these instalments, CDBiNET’s augments this expansive range of innovative facilities by adding the FB Friends transfer facility which is a first for the finance industry in the country.
With this focus on constantly pushing boundaries in technologically driven customer solutions, CDB has added another exciting dimension into this equation by having a weekly draw for customers who register with CDBiNet, offering an iPhone7 as the coveted prize.
In fact, the accessibility presented by CDBiNet through smartphones is well entrenched into the platform’s revolutionary persona, as it enables the download of the mobile app onto any smartphone via the Apple App Store or Android Google Play.
MD/CEO of CDB Mahesh Nanayakkara explains that CDB’s over 20-year history has been one constructed around meeting and exceeding stakeholder expectations.
“Our customers are integral to our success and in this era of intense competition, it has been stimulating to see our team use cutting edge technology to develop products that take us towards that constantly improving bar of customer service excellence.”
With the CDBiNet registration process simplified where both existing customers and new customers can become registered users with minimum hassle, General Manager - IT and e-commerce Imdad Naguib says, “Existing CDB savings account customers simply log onto www.cdbinet.lk or visit the nearest branch and activate their online account, while a new customer opens a new CDB savings account with a minimum deposit of Rs 500. Very simple, convenient and time saving.”
“FB Friends account holders have the additional convenience of logging onto the website through Facebook to effect fund transfers using this revolutionary technology.”
“What we give our customers through CDBiNet is a very secure, frictionless, seamless experience across all channels that collate 60+ readily available apps. Being CDB’s digital face, CDBiNet, with its built-in segmentation features, enables us to promote the right product to the right customer at the quickest time possible, while notably reducing our Total Cost Ownership (TCO) with unified digital channel solutions.”
