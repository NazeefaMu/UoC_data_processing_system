Forbidden art

In Sri Lanka the role of temple dancers did not carry any particular ritual purpose in the Sri Lankan Hindu temple traditions. Yet during the temple festivals these professional temple dancers performed dances in the temple premises as well as in the outer verandahs of the temples. Women of a particular caste were only supposed to perform this type of dance in the temples. The male members of this particular traditional class are still known Periyamelakarar because they play the large temple traditional musical instruments called Natheswaram or Nageswaram and Thavil.
Temple functions
Among all the traditional Tamil musical instruments, Natheswaram and Thavil are the biggest musical instruments. That’s why those who handle or play these instruments are often referred to as Periyamelakarar (that means the players of the big musical instruments). And the female members of this clan were known as Devaradiyarkal or Sinnamelakaries.
These female dancers were supposed to dance at the temple functions. With the passage of time, in Tamil Nadu practising and performing dances at the temples were banned by the State Legislative Assembly. Similarly, the moderate Hindu Tamil community and several social reformers of Sri Lanka also opposed the practice of dancing at the Hindu temples due to the malpractices of these temple dancers. And very often these dance programmes ended with disturbances.
The research studies on this subject reveal that first of all, the temple dance performances were stopped at the Arali Muttu Mari Amman temple in the Jaffna district by the bold action of the temple manager. This action caused vigilance among all the temple administrators in the island especially in the northern Sri Lanka. Gradually other temple authorities also tried to ban the dance performances at the Hindu temples in Sri Lanka. Similarly, many big temples like Nallur Kandaswamy temple, Jaffna and Mavidapuram Kandaswamy temple, Kankesanthurai also slowly discontinued and abandoned this tradition. Many of these temple dancers never adhered to the basic Hindu traditional norms or moral codes. They ate meat and danced at the temples.
Custom continued
Still reliable oral evidence reveals that most of these dancers drank and danced at the temples. All these incidents were the main causes to abandon these dance performances at the temples. When the big temples abandoned the temple dances, yet for a long time, village temples and small temples continued this custom. They arranged such programmes mainly to attract the crowd despite the fact that severe social stigma was strongly attached to this tradition.
During the British era the temple dancers were called Nautch girls. These temple dances were not considered as a part of temple rituals in Sri Lanka. But it was considered more or less as a social practice at the temples by the average people. However, in India dancing at temples was considered as a part of temple rituals.
According to Sri Lankan historical evidence of 1946, at one temple in Mallakam in the Jaffna district a large crowd was overwhelmed at a temple premises including, elderly people and small children irrespective of their age differences to view the dance performances of four Nautch girls in the temple premises.
Systematic refinement
This entertainment event normally started late in the nights and continued till the early hours of the following day. Those dancers dressed themselves with beautiful saris and heavy makeup. It was generally said that these dances of the Nautch girls were not either refined or systematically structured. No proper or well defined repertoire was adopted for their dances. Despite all these drawbacks certain temple authorities arranged these shows at their temples until the last quarter of the 20th century.
They arranged these shows just for entertainment especially during the festival time. Normally these dancers also started their dance with the invocation song on Lord Ganesha as usual in the Hindu tradition. In other words, the ancient temple dancers of Sri Lanka always dedicated the very first dance item to Lord Ganesha. In Hinduism Lord Ganesha is supposed to be the God of success, God of worldly wisdom and remover of obstacles, and later they switched on to some other songs of their own choice.
Hence the approach and practice of Hindu temple dance tradition in Sri Lanka was entirely different from the Indian Hindu temple dance traditions.
