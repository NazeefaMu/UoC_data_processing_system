Lanka tour will showcase how far we have progressed – BD captain and coach

Captain Mushfiqur Rahim and coach Chandika Hathurusingha both expressed the view that the upcoming tour of Sri Lanka by Bangladesh was another opportunity for them to show the world how far they have progressed in international cricket.
Of late Bangladesh widely regarded as the minnows and as easy beats in international cricket has made vast strides towards erasing that title bestowed on them by opposing teams.
Former Sri Lanka cricketer Chandika Hathurusingha now coach of Bangladesh addressing the press conference held at Taj Samudra yesterday.     
However in the past three years under the guidance of Hathurusingha Bangladesh have proved more than a handful for any side especially in their own conditions.
The conditions in Sri Lanka are not going to be any different to what they experience at home and with the know-how of Hathurusingha as head coach and a few other past Sri Lankans in the team’s support staff that includes Thilan Samaraweera (batting coach) and Mario Villavarayen (trainer) Bangladesh can fancy their chances on recording their maiden Test win over Sri Lanka.
“You can have all the support staff you want and the knowledge of the opposition. It also brings a lot of pressure because what is important is that the players must take that to the middle and perform,” said Mushfiqur at the media conference held at Taj Samudra yesterday.
“You could say that we have a better chance of winning on this occasion than in the past because some of Sri Lanka’s top batsmen have retired and they are somewhat an inexperienced side going through a period of team rebuilding. We know beating Sri Lanka in their conditions is not easy. They showed that against the Australians recently,” he said.
Hathurusingha, a former Sri Lanka cricketer and coach said that Sri Lanka has helped Bangladesh cricket progress in various ways. “We have played more Test matches against Sri Lanka than against any other country. Bangladesh is today in the same position as Sri Lanka was when I was playing. This tour will give us a chance to show how far we have come in cricket.
“Our preparations are no different to any other team. If we play to our potential we should have a very good chance. We are not taking Sri Lanka lightly,” he said.
Hathurusingha said that he held no grudges against Sri Lanka for being ditched as coach six years ago. “I have no regrets for what happened a long time ago. I am disappointed that I couldn’t help my country but I am happy with what I am doing now.”
Sri Lanka captain Rangana Herath said the Bangladesh series was another challenge against a team that is in the stages of rebuilding.
“If we perform to our potential we will win. I have the utmost confidence in my batsmen that they will deliver,” said Herath who led an inexperienced Sri Lanka side to a 2-0 win in Zimbabwe in his first stint as Test captain in November last year.
Commenting on the inclusion of left-arm spinner Malinda Pushpakumara in the Sri Lanka Test squad for the series, Herath said that any bowler taking over 50 wickets a season regularly has to be good.
“He has come a long way and he deserves to be included. Whether he will play in the series I cannot say. I am also a left-arm spinner like him and we have to strike a balance in the team. If he doesn’t play in this series I am sure he will get an opportunity in the next,” said Herath.
Sri Lanka coach Graham Ford said that one of the key areas that had affected the team’s performance has been fielding and every effort is being made to address that shortcoming. “We have a program in place where the boys are taught the basics in fielding techniques from the under 19 age group so that they will ready when they reach the senior level.
There is no quick fix to it. Fielding also includes speed, agility and fitness,” said Ford.
Bangladesh open their tour with a two-day warm-up game at Moratuwa on March 2 and 3 before moving to the first Test against Sri Lanka at Galle starting on March 7.
