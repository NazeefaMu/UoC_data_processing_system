Doublespeak dip and roll

Reply to Dr Senarath Tennakoon :
I refer to the article by Dr Senarath Tennakoon titled “Heathcare Doublespeak” in the Opinion page of September 19. In particular I refer to the paragraph which states thus “A democratic government is determined to uphold safeguard and develop free public education at all levels including university education to ensure that national education would not be left to the mercy of market forces and the privileged class”.
I am afraid he betrays a gross ignorance of the free market. It is the outcome of the free decisions of the individuals. Of course, the decisions to be effective in the market must be backed by the financial power for it is only through spending decisions that the resources provided by the suppliers are allocated. The usual criticism of the free market is that those who are wealthy exercise more market power.
True but there is another factor in the issue. The rich do not exercise such market power on the same essential goods but go for less essential or luxury goods. They do not spend money on a particular good but spread their spending on a multitude of goods and so they exercise a limit to their spending on the essential goods since spending on such goods is based on the need and once the needs are satisfied they do not accumulate more of such goods for consumption. Once they buy the required quantity of essential goods they do not accumulate such goods but go for less essential or luxury goods.
University education
The free market economy is the only resource allocation system that is impersonal and does not require a government controlling body to allocate resources. The communists thought economic planning and allocation of resources through central planning could be more rational and desirable to fulfil the needs of the less well off.
But they found that there is no substitute for a market price system and Lenin restored the free market using the war as an excuse for the failure of central planning through directives of the government.
It is true that there is inequality so that the outcome of the market may be distorted by the power of the better off who have more market power. But there is a limit to their spending on essential goods.
In any case there is no better alternative to the free market as a mechanism for the allocation of scarce goods and scarce resources.
As for free education it is free only in the sense that the receiver of the education is not called upon to pay for it. It does not mean there is no cost and the cost is borne by the society at large and in the case of university education the large mass of people are not gifted enough to take advantage of it.
Higher paying jobs
It is a small minority of persons who are sufficiently gifted with the brains to benefit from higher education. Once they finish such higher education they get jobs which pay far higher remuneration than those without such university education. It is true however that only a very small percentage of the students who are capable and fit for university education are admitted because of the limitation in the number of places in the universities.
But this is part of the problem of scarcity of resources in an economy to fulfil all the aspirations of people which among other things manifest as the demand for university placements.
Free education does not mean there is no cost to education. It only means such cost is borne by the people at large and not be beneficiaries.
Since all the people are not capable of receiving such education because of their limitations of intellect, the numbers entering the universities and passing out are limited.
But if and when even such numbers exceed the available vacancies for the higher paying jobs then there will be some unemployment even among the. Supply and Demand are the catchwords which explain the situation.
