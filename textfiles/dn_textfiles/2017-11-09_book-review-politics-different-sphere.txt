book review: Politics in a different sphere

Title: Mind Politics in Buddhism: Struggle for Power and Peace Author: Professor Ananda Welihena
The term politics can be defined as a struggle for power and peace. This definition was introduction by none other than the American political scientist. Hans Morgenthau, in his work, Polities among Nations: Struggle for Power and Peace.
This concept of politics reveals how nations, or states, are engaged in the pursuit of power and peace. Their principal aim is to seek power, and in effect, achieve peace for progress. Power is also being used in order to wage war and to do evil to nature. Everyone's wish is that power must be used to do service and achieve peace. Acquired power must be retained, expanded and reinforced. The state, or the polity, is eager to become an empowered by using the acquired power.
Religions, in the past and in the present, have waged war and also done service. They have struggled to preserve their position and power. Currently, people are behaving violently in the name of religion. Race is one other factor which has contributed to violent uprisings. Ethnic groups have struggled to defend their specific culture and identity. These three groups, for an example, have the potential to purify and cultivates noble values, and in effect, become empowered in order to be of service to the world.
As states, religion and ethnic groups struggle for power and peace, the human mind equally struggles for power and peace. It is engaged in politics. It is engaged in a political task. Its aim is to be powerful and peaceful, despite many difficulties and problems. Its desire is to proceed from impurity to cultivation of noble values. A state struggles to achieve power and peace by resorting to economic, social and cultural development. A state that has struggled and gained power is called politically developed country. A politically developed state has power, which implies that in is valuable and beautiful. It becomes the cynosure on the people.
How does a mind strive to become powerful and peaceful? How does it achieve value and beauty? It can become powerful and peaceful by resorting two strategies. They are: 1) Purification and 2) Cultivation, Purification implies that negative values, thoughts and beliefs must be noted and uprooted by using the tool of mindfulness. One has to be liberal and equanimous. Cultivation implies that he purified mind is used as the soil to cultivate. When weeds of negative thoughts and feelings are uprooted, purity arises in the mind. It is not easy to purity the mind and cultivate noble values in the purified mind soil. There are obstacles cultivated. Purity and cultivation are the hidden potentials of the empowered entity. A developed and empowered mind is charged with power, value and beauty. Mind has to struggle hard to gain like the State, religion and race is become developed and empowered. It must struggle to achieve this wish.
It is not facile to uproot weeds of negative thoughts and values and cultivate seeds of noble values. One has to struggle hard. It means that one has to engage in mind politics. This struggle will produce the favourable results of power, value and beauty at the level of the mind.
A farmer concentrates on a piece of land, uproots weeds, removes its stone,s thorns and roots. A mind developer, or mind fornicator purifies and cultivates the mind by uprooting negative thoughts and cultivating positive values. The land becomes .......and contributory the cultivated mind too become cultivate, innovative and contributory. The cultivated mind. Like a cultivated land, can be called empowered. It can be called a work of art.
Mind struggles to become a work of art. This struggle is political, because it has conflicts and difficulties. Lord Buddha is one who was involved in the work of mind struggle or mind politics. He was initially involved in state politics at the royal palace of his father, who was the King of a region in India. He decided to involve in mind politics by choosing a forest life initially. His findings are recorded in the Dhammapada verses.
There are 423 verses in the Dhammapada; they reveal how one can be trained and formed to struggle for power and peace.
“Just as an arrow maker straightens an arrow shaft, even so the discerning person straightens his mind, so fickle and unsteady, so difficult to guard and control” (Dh. Verse No. 33).
A politician's mission is to purify and cultivate the polity, and in effect, empower it with value and beauty. A mind developer's task is to purify the mind and cultivate it with seeds of noble values.
Both are engaged in the struggle for power and peace. Plato, the Greek philosopher, wrote in his work Republic that kings must be philosophers. And philosopher must be kings. A mind developer's role is to struggle and lead the mind from impurity to purity and from purity to cultivation of noble values. As the state, or the polity, desires to bloom where it is planted with the help of the politicians, the mind too wishes to boom where it is planted, with the assistance, of the human being. Mind politics is about how the mind struggle to achieve and acquire power and peace through a process purification and cultivation, Meditation (Bhavana) is the most popular strategy that the Buddhas had taught his disciple to practice. “Wisdom springs from meditation” (Dh Verse No. 282).
In this direction, Professor Ananda Welihena’s treatise is noteworthy. Professor Welihena is a learnt philosopher. He secured a special BA degree in a Political Science and International Relations from the University of Peradeniya in 1984.
He pursued a Master's degree at the University of Colombo, and joined the academic staff of the Department of Political Science of the University of Peradeniya. This interdisciplinary work is base don the experiences and learning, gained at the University of Peradeniya as a member of the academic staff.
Author writes that mind can be defined as the sixth sense of the human person according to Buddhism. It can be developed and trained, purified and cultivated as the other five senses for the good of oneself and the happiness of the world. This is the good news preached by the Buddha. In the process of evolution, mind's development is indispensable. A polity, too, should be developed by struggling for power and peace.
Mind is in a state of anarchy; it demands law and order, peace and harmony, security and prosperity. Society is in a state of anarchy as well. The Hobbesonian State of Nature prevails, where each man is a wolf to another (home, homine, lupus). The human being and the head of a State must struggle, and gain power and peace.
