Nearly 200,000 coconut trees felled to stop disease spread

Nearly 200,000 fruit bearing coconut trees in the Matara district are cut down due to a coconut leaves withering disease spreading in the district, research and field officials attached to the Matara District office of the Coconut Cultivation Board said.
Owners have been compensated at Rs. 2,000 per tree, coconut research officials added.
The spread of the disease is now controlled to a large extent in the Matara district at present due to the cutting of trees, they said.
Coconut research officials advised cultivators and coconut land owners to inform officials if they notice any symptoms of the disease.
Meanwhile, programmes to promote fruit cultivation has commenced at Divisional Secretariat Divisional level in Matara covering Weligama, Welipitiya, Malimbada, Akuressa, Pasgoda and Devinuwara.
The programmes have made considerable progress, officials said. Pineapple, papaw, passion fruit, cashew, rambutan, durian, banana and yams were promoted.
Citrus cultivation is also expanded under the programme. Lands in which coconut trees were removed due to the leaf withering disease and barren rubber lands have been used for the purpose.
Quality planting material, cultivation instructions, and technical know-how are provided to cultivators to further encourage growers.
Extending a boost to the country’s cultivation drive and the enhancement of living conditions of low-income families is the aim of these endeavours, project officials added.
