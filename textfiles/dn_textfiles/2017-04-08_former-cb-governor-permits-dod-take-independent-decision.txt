Former CB Governor permits DOD to take independent decision

With regard to deciding penalty against PTL:
The former Governor Arjun Mahendran permitted the Domestic Operations Department to take an independent decision with regards to deciding a penalty against Perpetual Treasuries (Pvt) Limited, on an Intra-day facility default, DOD Director P.W.D.N.R. Rodrigo said.
DOD Director Rodrigo was testifying before the Presidential Commission Inquiring into the Treasury Bond issue yesterday.
It was revealed at the Commission recently, that Perpetual Treasuries (Pvt) Limited (PTL) was at a Rs.11.6 billion ILF default on April 1, 2016.
Such a default was not a usual occurrence, Rodrigo said, replying to a question directed by Deputy Solicitor General Milinda Gunatilake, who was leading evidence for the day.
The PTL requested the DOD to split the defaulted ICIN into two, but we told them we have no room to make such an intervention to the electronic settle system.
“So I called the then Governor Mahendran to let him know that there was an institution which had not settled their ILF facility.” Rodrigo said. Then he asked me in which bank it was, Rodrigo explained. Then I told Governor Mehendran that it was not a bank who had defaulted, but a primary dealer and to be specific, it was the PTL, Rodrigo further said. Mahendran told me that since I must be aware of the connection he had to the PTL, ‘why don’t you take an independent decision and let me know about it as well,’ Rodrigo told the Commission.
Rodrigo firmly stated that former Governor Mahendran did not give any instructions regarding the matter.
He also said the PTL’s offence was taken into the Monetary Board and a direction was issued limiting the PTL to deal with more than one billion in the secondary market.
