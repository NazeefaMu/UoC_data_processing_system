Kandy Youth SC to organize tournament in memory of EW Balasuriya

Kandy Youth Sports Club are organizing a rugby, cricket and football tournament in memory of E. W. Balasuriya who was a great benefactor of Kandy sports and whose contributions should be weighed in gold. Today many seem to have forgotten those past glorious moments that Balasuriya brought to sports in Kandy. But fortunately there are still a few who remember the part played by promoters such as ‘Bala’ or EW as he was fondly called. Balasuriya was the founder of Kandy Lake Club and Kandy RFC. These two clubs produced top sportsmen in rugby, cricket and iron sports. ‘EW’ was a product of Dharmaraja College and Ananda College, where he excelled in cricket, as a fine left hand opening batsman.
The first sport he started was cricket and some of the players were Bertie Gomes, Neville Heritage, D. D. de Alles, M. E. Marker, Z. M. Zeros and P. Pries to name a few. Most of these players played for Up-Country and Central Province.
He was at one time the secretary of the Central Province Cricket Association and the first who organized the first international cricket match after Sri Lanka won Test status in Kandy. At one time he was also in the BCCL Ex-Co.
The second sport introduced by EW to the club was rugby in 1963. They played in the inter club “B” division tournament. The side was led by an Antonian Niyaz Majeed, some of the top sports lovers who helped EW in this sport was Col. Stanley Ratwatte, Noel Paranagama, Dr. C.D.L. Fernando, Sidney Ratwatte and Maurice Perera, the last two named were the coaches.
Kandy Lake Clubs first rugby team was made out of products from Trinity, St. Anthony’s, Vidyartha, St. Sylvester’s and St. Paul’s now Sri Sumangala. Due to the support and the good work, in three years EW turned out a champion team that had players like TB Wijesinghe who led the side, a top wing- three-quarter. After seeing him playing against CR Bees, CR and FC absorbed him and half way during the season, so the captaincy went to Farook Dole. uncle of present Sri Lanka Rugby selection committee chairman Rohan Abeyakoon. They were unbeaten till the last match against NCC which they lost. The following year 1967 they were promoted to “A” division and played alongside clubs like Havelock SC, Kandy SC, Dimbulla A & CC, Dickoya MMC, Uva, KV, CH and FC, CR and FC and Army SC. In the very first year they were placed third in the “A” Division League table, behind Havelock SC and CR and FC. A few years later the club was suspended by the controlling body for having professional players, today even the forces have professionals playing for them.
E.W. continued the good work as he and his friends like Col. Stanley Ratwatte, Dr. C. D. L. Fernando and Dr. Dago Gunawardene started the Kandy Rugby Football Club KRFC. Some of the new rugby faces who joined the old were Alex Lazarus, Nihal Jayatilake, Jadi Dissanayake, Iswan Oman and Shafie Jainudeen.
In the mid 1970’s Kandy SC was not that good at winning matches, most of the players were planters and could not attend practices, some young ruggerites come for practices but when the matches are played the planters get selected even without turning up for practice. Seeing this downfall one time Sri Lanka and Kandy SC president Dr. K.B. Sangakkara suggested to E.W. to amalgamate Kandy RFC with Kandy SC and play under one banner. E.W. agreed and they played under one name Kandy Sports Club from 1974 with the Kandy SC jersey and Kandy RFC colour on the stockings.
The following year 1975 E.W. became the president and the first Kandy RFC player to captain Kandy SC was Iswan Omar. E.W. continued to help Kandy SC as its patron, till his death.
