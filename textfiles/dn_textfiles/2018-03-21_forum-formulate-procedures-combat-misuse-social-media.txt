Forum to formulate procedures to combat misuse of social media

While appreciating the government’s quick response and various measures taken to avoid spreading violence across the country, the Computer Society of Sri Lanka (CSSL) requested the government to restore the normalcy for the social media use once the situation became under control.
However, as responsible professionals, the CSSL is proposing to the government to open a dialogue with key stakeholders as to how such situations can be better managed in the future and what processes can be implemented to have a more conducive and peaceful digital environment.
In this context, CSSL Executive Council headed up by its President Yasas V. Abeywickrama has decided to gather the technical experts and formulate ways of better managing social media whilst ensuring freedom of speech.
Abeywickrama said, “We call all technical experts on matters such as internet management, internet security, hate content detection, social media monitoring tools etc, to participate at the upcoming focus group forum.”
“With these experts and interested individuals, we will formulate the proposals to be forward to the government.”
The forum for the experts will be held on March 23, at 6pm at CSSL Professional Center Colombo 7.
