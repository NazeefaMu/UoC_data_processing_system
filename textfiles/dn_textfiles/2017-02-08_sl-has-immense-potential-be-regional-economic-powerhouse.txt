SL has immense potential to be regional economic powerhouse

Sri Lanka’s has great potential to emerge as an economic powerhouse in the region, Acting Under Secretary of State for Public Diplomacy and Public Affairs Ambassador Bruce Wharton said.He made these comments at the Sri Lanka National Day reception in Washington, D.C.
“It boasts one of the most strategic maritime locations in the entire Indo-Pacific: at the nautical crossroads of Africa, South Asia, and East Asia, with the Strait of Hormuz to its west and the Strait of Malacca to its east. Forty percent of all seaborne oil passes through the former and half the world’s merchant fleet capacity sails through the latter, making the sea lanes off of Sri Lanka’s southern coast some of the world’s most important economic arteries,” he added. Wharton said in the 21st century, a country’s most important economic asset is its people, and Sri Lanka can harness its ambitious and entrepreneurial population to achieve great things.
