Refusal to hoist National Flag:
JHU urges action against NP Minister

The Jathika Hela Urumaya (JHU) yesterday urged authorities to take immediate action against Northern Province Education Minister S. Sarveshwaran who had recently attended an event at a school in Vavuniya as the Chief Guest and had refused to hoist the National Flag at the ceremony.
Addressing the media yesterday at JHU Office, Battaramulla, JHU Co-Chairman and Skills Development and Vocational Training Deputy Minister Karunaratne Paranavithana said: “such people are attempting to destroy the unity among the people by doing such cheap things”.
“This incident cannot be neglected since it was done by a public representative. Therefore, the result would badly affect the country. As a public representative, he cannot promote his personal separatist ideology,” he said.
