Govt signed SLSFTA without Cabinet approval - MP Wimal

National Freedom Front Leader Parliamentarian Wimal Weerawansa yesterday alleged that the government has signed the Free Trade Agreement (SLSFTA) between Sri Lanka and Singapore without Cabinet approval.
He was addressing the media yesterday at the NFF office in Pitakotte.
Sri Lanka and Singapore signed the Sri Lanka-Singapore Free Trade Agreement (SLSFTA) on January 23, 2018 during the visit of Singapore Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong in Colombo.
MP Weerawansa further alleged that International trade Minister Malik Samarawickrema has misled the Cabinet of Ministers by making fake documents to sign this agreement.
“There was no urgent need of signing such an agreement since Singapore does not impose special taxes on Sri Lankan exports. This agreement has been signed without informing the professionals and industrialists who will be directly affected from this agreement,” said the MP.
He further said that the Cabinet Paper with this regard had been submitted to the Cabinet on January 9, 2018. Though this had been discussed during a Cabinet meeting, Cabinet of Ministers did not grant the approval.
He urged the government to withdraw this agreement and invited the professionals to come forward to fight against this agreement.
