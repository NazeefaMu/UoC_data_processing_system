Bellas return in ‘Pitch Perfect 3’

Now graduated from college and out in the real world where it takes more than a cappella to get by, the Bellas return in ‘Pitch Perfect 3’, the next chapter in the beloved series that has taken in more than $400 million at the global box office.
After the highs of winning the World Championships, the Bellas find themselves split apart and discovering there aren’t job prospects for making music with your mouth. But when they get the chance to reunite for an overseas USO tour, this group of awesome nerds will come together to make some music, and some questionable decisions, one last time.
Anna Kendrick, Rebel Wilson, Hailee Steinfeld, Brittany Snow, Anna Camp, Hana Mae Lee, Ester Dean, Alexis Knapp, Chrissie Fit, Kelley Jakle, Shelley Regner, Elizabeth Banks and John Michael Higgins all return and are joined by additions including John Lithgow and Ruby Rose. ‘Pitch Perfect 3’ is again produced by Paul Brooks of Gold Circle Entertainment and Max Handelman and Elizabeth Banks of Brownstone Productions, and is directed by Trish Sie (Step Up All In).
‘Pitch Perfect 3’ is screening at Liberty By Scope Cinemas, Sky Lite Malabe, Ruoo Cinema Katunayaka, and Raja – Jaffna.
