Rs 15 b to be borrowed for wind power generation

The Power and Renewable Energy Ministry hopes to obtain credit of Rs.15 billion from the Samurdhi Development Fund on concessionary terms. "This will be to launch wind power generation projects accross Sri Lanka".The Asian Development Bank (ADB) has allocated $200 million to support the wind energy sector in Sri Lanka. Speaking to Trade Unions of the Electricity Board he said that all 'debt' that the Ceylon Electricity Board had has now been transferred to the Treasury.
"Due to this, the CEB will not have to increase domestic electricity tariffs." The Minister said the biggest debt the CEB has was for the Norochcholai power plant which was Rs. 1.2 billion. (SS)
