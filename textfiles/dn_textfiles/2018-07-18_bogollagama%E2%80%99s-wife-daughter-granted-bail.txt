Bogollagama’s wife, daughter granted bail

Eastern Province Governor Rohitha Bogollagama’s wife Deepthi Bogollagama and daughter Dilhani Bogollagama were granted bail by Colombo Chief Magistrate Ranga Dissanayake when they surrendered to the court yesterday.
The Magistrate bailed them on sureties of Rs 100,000 each.
The Magistrate last Friday ordered the arrest of the wife and daughter of the Eastern Province Governor for failing to appear before the court over the attempted assault of his daughter-in-law on April 6.
President’s Counsel Jayantha Weerasinghe appearing on behalf of the suspects, said that the incident allegedly took place on April 6, but the complainant had lodged the complaint only on April 11. He also submitted that she had informed Bogollagama’s wife that she wanted to get divorced from Bogollagama’s son. The President’s Counsel submitted that Bogollagama’s wife had informed her daughter-in-law to return her wedding ring and the necklace. Weerasinghe submitted that although she (the complainant ) had noted in the complaint that the suspects had forcibly detained her in a hotel, it was incorrect.
He added that the hotel bill too had been paid by the complainant herself. The copy of the bill was produced before the court.
Bogollagama’s daughter-in-law was not present in the court house yesterday and attorney-at-law Sajitha Jayawardena appearing for her, submitted that she had gone to Australia.
Bogollagama’s wife and daughter were charged with levelling death threats to the complainant over the phone.
After considering all matters, the Magistrate fixed the inquiries for June 22 and ordered the complainant to appear before the court on September 03.
