Competitor analysis key to unlock winning marketing strategy

The extent of rivalry in an industry is subject to the number, size and intention of the various players. The competition is aggravated when the market is not growing and when costs are escalating. Companies in such an industry find it difficult to make decent returns or even to survive. This is where assessing the competitors becomes a crucial process in business planning.
A competitor analysis provides you with the knowledge to make an informed decision on what aspect of your company gives you a competitive edge. Creating a PR or marketing plan without solid research on your competitors is like competing in a game without knowing the judging criteria.
The customer is your judge, and they have done their research. So, should you! Depending on your niche, professionals create different types of competitor analysis reports based on ratings and research.
Besides the basics, there are four stones that usually remain unturned in a competitor analysis. They are the keys to strong positioning and should be a fundamental driving concept to your overall campaign.
Understand your horizontal
Finding the balance between your opposition in the industry, and where to find the highest return, is one of the most effective ways to create a strategy. Correlate where your competition is light - allowing you to pick the low hanging fruit - and you still could earn a return on investment (ROI).
Understanding your horizontal plane is a common-sense formula. It keeps you grounded to reality, and what’s actually possible. This doesn’t mean don’t dream big, but you mustn’t miss the more obvious opportunities either.
Understand your vertical
Part of understanding where your company’s low hanging fruit grows is finding your vertical market. Vertical refers to the various niche markets surrounding your industry. For example, if you sell motion sensor water sprinklers, your horizontal competitors are other home and garden companies selling water sprinklers.
Think in vertical terms, and you can narrow the competition by specializing in a particular niche, water sprinklers to keep animals out of your yard, for example. This presents your company with an entirely different target audience to pursue.
Explore the big picture marketplace for your products, and the competition in each niche.
Behind the scenes activity
Once you know your vertical, and horizontal -where your low hanging fruit grows, it’s time to figure out how to beat your competitors. Find out where your competitors are seen online. Simply type in your competitor’s URL to view what websites link back to their website. Odds are, if the blog or news site carried an article from your competition, they will accept one from you as well.
Knowing your competitors’ online activity gives you an upper hand in discovering their strategies and goals. If you see a competitor lowering their prices it might be a tactic to increase their market share. Keeping an eye on your competitors’ activities will help you anticipate their goals and respond strategically.
Ranking popularity
Your competition’s fiscal performance only tells one side of the story. What’s behind their success or failure is what you need to find out. Studying a competitor’s shortcomings is just as important as knowing why they succeed. Your campaign must take into consideration both preventative and proactive tactics.
Investigating customer reviews online, and comments on social media, creates a different approach to analyzing competitors, as well as your own SWOT analysis. See what’s trending about your competitor on the Internet, or read the tweets they were mentioned in. Consider gathering a good portion of your competitor analysis data on Twitter. This will help you better understand your competition in the eyes of your consumer.
Now, let us come back to basics
Some businesses think it is best to get on with their own plans and ignore the competition. Some become obsessed with tracking the actions of competitors - often using underhand or illegal methods. Other businesses are happy simply to track the competition, copying their moves and reacting to changes.
Competitor analysis has several important roles in strategic planning: (1) It helps management understand their competitive advantages/disadvantages relative to competitors. (2) It generates understanding of competitors’ past, present (and most importantly) future strategies. (3) It provides an informed basis to develop strategies to achieve competitive advantage in the future. (4) It forecasts the returns that may be made from future investments (e.g. how will competitors respond to a new product or pricing strategy?
Casual knowledge about competitors usually is insufficient in competitor analysis. Rather, competitors should be analyzed systematically, using organized competitor intelligence-gathering to compile a wide array of information so that well informed strategy decisions can be made.
Framework
The framework for analyzing competitors is based on the following four key aspects of a competitor: (1) Competitor’s objectives, (2) Competitor’s assumptions, (3) Competitor’s strategy, (4) Competitor’s capabilities. (Note – 1 and 2 are what drive the competitor, and 3 and 4 are what the competitor is doing or is capable of doing).
Sources
There are a number of sources of information for competitor analysis. The sources of competitor information can be neatly grouped into three categories:
(1) Recorded data: this is easily available in published form either internally or externally. Good examples include competitor annual reports, press releases, newspaper or magazine articles, Government reports, presentations and product brochures;
(2) Observable data: this has to be actively sought and often assembled from several sources. A good example is competitor pricing, advertising campaigns, tenders;
(3) Opportunistic data: to get hold of this kind of data requires a lot of planning and organization. Much of it is “anecdotal”, coming from discussions with suppliers, customers and, perhaps, previous management of competitors, trade shows, seminars and conferences and recruiting ex-employees.
The process of gathering competitive data is similar to a jigsaw puzzle. Each individual piece of data does not have much value. The important skill is to collect all pieces and to assemble them into an overall picture of the competitor. This enables you to identify any missing pieces and to take the necessary steps to collect them.
Business Objectives
To predict your competitor’s future moves you should first have a good understanding of their business objectives. Where and how they want to grow their business and how are they different to your own.
(1) Do any of your competitors have fundamentally different objectives to your own organization? You should be able to determine why they are so different. Are they successful? Should you be interested in adopting them as your own? These fundamentally different objectives need to be monitored and analyzed as they tend to have the ability to shift the market dramatically one way or another
(2) Examine your main rivals past actions and objectives. What were the drivers for these?
(3) Are there indicators of failure with the objectives / evidence of past capital expendture, trademark or research activity? If so has this made the firms risk adverse and is this reflected in the scope of their objectives?
(4) What are the implicit objectives of your rival firms down the street? What are the directors saying to their clients and to the press? Are they different to the objectives you understand to be true? If they are not known to be true, what else are they exaggerating the truth with?
(5) Monitor on an ongoing basis what the directors and management are saying. What are they not saying? Do they indicate any current objectives? Monitor your own firms press coverage. What are you giving away to your rivals? What are the industry experts saying about you and your rivals’ future position?
(6) Where do your rival organizations want to go? What are their plans? Will these plans distract them from their core activities or will they be forced to drop non-core sectors? Are there opportunities for you?
It is likely that your objectives as well as those of your rivals will probably have a number of strategies. You would like to – sell more of the same products/services in existing markets, develop more business in new markets, introduce new products/services into current markets, - acquire or move into suppliers or customers areas of expertise to ensure continued supply of own services, achieve increased sales, profits, return on assets or investment etc.
These are critical objectives upon which your organization’s future development rests. Determine carefully what your rivals’ strategies are in these fields.
Strategies
The purpose of competitive strategy is to build a sustainable competitive advantage over the organization’s rivals. It defines the fundamental decisions that guide the organization’s marketing, financial management and operating strategies.
Three basic strategic approaches are possible:
Offensive strategy - This strategy often requires significant capital investment and includes radical options. (a) Changing or altering the competitive structure or environment in your industry (forward or backward integration, acquiring competitors, etc.). (b) Anticipating industry competitive structural change and positioning your organization to exploit this change before others recognize it (developing substitute products, changing the mode of sale or distribution, etc.). (c) Diversifying into more attractive markets.
Defensive strategy – This strategy accepts the industry competitive forces as a given and position your organization to best defend against them. As a last resort this could include harvesting and selling the business before competitive conditions cause its value to drop.
Guerilla or niche strategy – This includes minimizing or neutralizing barriers by reducing the size of the playing field and taking an offensive or defensive position in a smaller, more attractive market segment.
Every business has some sort of a competitive strategy. However, many strategies are implicit, having evolved over time, rather than explicitly formulated from a thinking and planning process. Implicit strategies lack focus, produce inconsistent decisions, and unknowingly become obsolete. Without a well-defined strategy, organizations will be driven by current operational issues rather than by a planned future vision.
