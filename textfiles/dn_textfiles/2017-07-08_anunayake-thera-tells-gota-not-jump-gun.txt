Anunayake Thera tells Gota not to jump the gun

Slams Dinesh for speeches with no basis:
The Anunayake of the Malwathu Chapter Ven. Dimbulkumbure Wimaladhamma Thera told former Defence Secretary Gotabhaya Rajapaksa that opposition to the proposed Constitution has no basis.
“It is akin to making a horoscope for an unborn baby,” the Anunayake Thera said, stating that the opposition to a Constitution for which a draft has not been finalised is futile.
Rajapaksa met the Prelate to recieve blessings yesterday after visiting and paying homage at the Temple of the Tooth Relic and thereafter visiting the Mahanayakes of the Asgiriya and Malwathu Chapters.
The Anunayaka Thera said it was futile protesting a proposed Constitution for which there is no draft let alone it being adopted.
The Anunayaka Thera further said that he watched Joint Opposition leader Dinesh Gunawardena speaking aggressively in Parliament and that the speeches made by him lacked substance.
“We met the President and we infomred him that they should pay heed to the sufferings of the common man. The cost of living has risen and people cant afford food,” the Anunayake Thera said.
