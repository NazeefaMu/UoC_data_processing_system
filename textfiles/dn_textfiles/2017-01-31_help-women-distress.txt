Help for women in distress

The Women in Distress Organisation, Women and Child Bureau of the Police and the Asia Foundation have taken initiatives to introduce a mobile app to help provide security to women who undergo violence and harassment.
The “2SIX4 App” has a similar meaning to the hotline (2 444 444) of the Women and Child Bureau of the police.
The app will be under trial from January 30 to March 7. The app will be officially launched on International Women’s Day (March 8).
Women facing violence or harassment can immediately inform the Women and Child Bureau of the Police, a nearby hospital or the Women in Distress Organisation.
The app will also allow the user to contact five relatives or friends.
Professor Maithri Wickremesinghe, Women in Distress Executive Director Savithri Wijesekera, Women and Child Bureau ASP Lanka Rajini Amarasena and Asian Foundation Director Dinesha Wickramannayake also attended the event.
