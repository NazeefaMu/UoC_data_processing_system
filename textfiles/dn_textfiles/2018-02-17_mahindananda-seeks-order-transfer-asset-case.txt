Mahindananda seeks order to transfer asset case

Filing a Transfer Application in the Court of Appeal, former Sports Minister Mahindananda Aluthgamage sought an order transferring a case filed against him to any other court of competent jurisdiction other than the Colombo High Court presided over by High Court Judge Gihan Kulatunga.
The Attorney General had filed indictments against Aluthgamage for allegedly purchasing a house worth Rs.27 million at Kynsey Road, Colombo 7 over a complaint that he had allegedly purchased properties through illegally acquired money.
On a previous occasion, this case had been fixed for trial on February 20, 21 and 22 by High Court Judge Gihan Kulatunga.
High Court Judge Gihan Kulatunga is the Colombo High Court Judge who delivered the judgment regarding Controversial Sil Redi (fabrics used by devotees to observe sil) distribution case.
Former Secretary to the President Lalith Weeratunge and former Telecommunications Regulatory Commission (TRC) Director General Anusha Palpita were sentenced to three years' rigorous imprisonment by the Colombo High Court for misappropriating Rs. 600 million of funds belonging to the TRC.
In his petition, Aluthgamage stated that High Court Judge Gihan Kulatunga was a member of the Presidential Commission (PRECIFAC) which initiated an inquiry against members of the former regime and further said he would deny a fair trial.
When the Transfer Application was taken up before Court of Appeal (President) Justice Preethi Padman Surasena and Justice Shiran Gunaratne, the matter was transferred to another bench to be on February 20.
President’s Counsel Faizer Mustapha instructed by Sanath Wijewardena appeared for Mahindananda Aluthgamage.
