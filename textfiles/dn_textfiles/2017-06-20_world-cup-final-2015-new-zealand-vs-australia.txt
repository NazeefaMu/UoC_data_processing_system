World Cup final 2015-New Zealand vs Australia

This was it, the big occasion; Australia fronted up with New Zealand, in front of a massive crowd of 100,000, there next door neighbor on March 29, 2015. The atmosphere was electric; New Zealand won the toss and elected to bat.
Martin Guptill and Brendon McCullum strode out to the crease to open and Starc opened the bowling for Australia. Martin took first strike for the Kiwis and opened scoring with a nudge down to third man, the next ball was a late in dipper and had McCullum beaten all ends up and the very next one had his castle shattered, with this wicket of McCullum’s New Zealand’s hopes were somewhat shattered.
Kane Williams was the next man in and Josh Hazelwood was the other bowler, 6 for 1 off 2 overs. Starc was hitting the bat hard and Guptill reached for the ball which was overpithed and stroked it through covers for four, 11 for 1.
Guptill was going ‘pell mell,” and top edged a miscalculated hook for a six off Hazelwood, 17 for 1 off 4 overs. Williamson at the other end was dawdling along without scoring for 11 balls and then edged Starc for a single. Starc was bowling line and length swinging the ball either way making life difficult for Williamson in particular, his tactics to keep Guptill calm was to bowl outside the off stump moving the ball away from him,this enabled the score to be kept at 23 for 1 after 7 overs. Australian fielding was spot on and must have saved about a dozen runs.
It was 24 for I after 9 overs, Williamson at last managed to drive Hazelwood past mid-off for four, Australia was calling the shots at the moment, Johnson was beating Williamson back to back with late swing but without luck, then all of a sudden Guptill went, getting bowled playing up to a pitched up ball.
Ross Taylor the next man in was greeted with a juicy full toss and dispatched it to the long off boundary for four, 38 for 2 off 12 overs. Williamson’s misery ends when he lobs a return catch to Johnson, 41 for 3 off 12 overs. Grant Elliot was the new man in. Hazelwood’s pinpoint accuracy seems to bother Taylor, 47 for 3 off 15 overs, James Faulkner came to the attack to join Hazelwood and runs seems to run dry, at this stage New Zealand could not lose a wicket as these two were the last of repute. Elliot cuts loose and drove Starc through mid-off and extra cover for four and then cut Maxwell for four and he moved to 22 off 25 balls, 77 for 3 off 22 overs, run rate was found wanting at 3.5. Elliot now took the “bull by the horns “top edged Starc for six and hoisted Maxwell over cover for four which brought the fifty partnership off 69 balls.
Elliot sparkled again this time through the covers for four and he was on a run a ball 45 and up went the hundred for New Zealand, Taylor played the anchor role but treated the loose balls well, he guided a short and wide ball from Watson through vacant slip for four. The batsmen at that moment was dealing with only three’s and two’s mainly due to the huge size of the ground coupled with the brilliant fielding of the Aussies. However Elliot was daring and he tipped Hazelwood for four over slips which brought the hundred partnership up, 144 for 3 off 33.3 overs. Elliot tipped Watson past the keeper for four, 150 for 3 off 35 overs, Ross Taylor went caught behind by Haddin off Faulkner and Anderson got yorked by the same bowler for 0, 150 for 5 off 35.3 overs, Ronchi came and went, 152 for 6 off 37 overs. Finally New Zealand reached 183, thanks to a brave knock of 82 off 83 balls by Elliott. It was an outstanding effort of bowling and fielding by Australia.
The Australians started their innings rather shakily, Finch got out to a Bolt inswinger for 2. Warner and Smith put on a fifty run partnership, 56 for 1 off 10 overs, New Zealand tried hard to break this partnership but the batsmen were well set. Warner got too adventurous and tried the hook shot once too often and paid the price, caught by Elliot at mid-wicket for 45.
It was a historic moment now as Clarke came to the wicket for the last time on his one day career. After a scratchy start Clarke was on song, and unleashed his full repertoire of strokes, he was out for 74, and got a standing ovation from the massive crowd.
Micheal Clarke has always been a gentle type of a captain, an emotional type unlike Steve Waugh and Allan Border, this I feel adds sanity to the proceedings rather than the win at any cost attitude, adopted by even the Indians today. The Indians recently got the beating of their life from the Sri Lankan’s by trying to be too cocky and emotional and the Sri Lankan’s showed their metal in the end upsetting all odds.
