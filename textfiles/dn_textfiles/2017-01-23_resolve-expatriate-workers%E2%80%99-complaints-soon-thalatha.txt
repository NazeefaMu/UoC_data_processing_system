Resolve expatriate workers’ complaints soon: Thalatha

Foreign Employment Minister Thalatha Athukorala has directed the Sri Lanka Bureau of Foreign Employment to probe complaints received from Sri Lankan Expatriate workers expeditiously and ensure that justice is done to them without delay.
The Minister said Sri Lanka expatriate workers could minimise problems at the workplace if they registered with the SLBFE prior to their departure.
She said there had been a 43 percent reduction in complaints from expatriate workers in 2015 compared to the previous year.
A SLBFE release says the number of complaints received by the Bureau’s mediation unit in 2015 was 10,505 while 2016, it was 6,156.
This was a 43 percent decrease when compared to the number in 2016.
In 2016, most of the complaints came from the Middle East countries. Of them, 3,411 were from Saudi Arabia while Kuwait, 915, Qatar 618, the UAE 507, Malaysia 201, Oman 282, and Jordan 106.
Most issues were related to the failure on the part of employers to offer the promised jobs and wages, breach of the service contract by the employer, harassment and injustice caused by outside parties.
