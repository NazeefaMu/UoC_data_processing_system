PPJ election campaigns have no leader’s picture: Amaraweera

"The Sri Lanka Podu Jana Peramuna (PPJ) is the only political party contesting the forthcoming local government elections without the picture of its leader on its election literature. The party is displaying the picture of Mahinda Rajapaksa instead, Fisheries and Aquatic Resources Minister and UPFA General Secretary Mahinda Amaraweera said.
He was addressing an election rally held at the Angunukolapelessa Town Hall on January 20 in support of UPFA candidates contesting the Angunukolapelessa Pradesheeya Sabha election.
Minister Amaraweera said the forthcoming election was not a contest to change the President or the Prime Minister but to appoint a representative to undertake village development schemes. He said voters should consider the ability and credentials of the candidate when they vote for their representatives to develop the villages.
Amaraweera said he was providing housing assistance to the people, while Minister Sajith Premadasa was providing housing loans for them. He said politicians elected by the people, hereafter had to think not only twice but several more times before engaging in bribery and corruption.
He said the people earlier questioned the prudence of the SLFP joining hands with the UNP to form a consensus government, but now they force them to stay on and strengthen the President's hands to punish those engaged in fraud and corruption.
"President Maithripala is a farmer's son and he has a clean political record. He helped the country achieve international recognition and restored the GSP plus facility, He also saved former President Rajapaksa, former Defence Secretary and the war heroes from the electric chair," Minister Amaraweera said.
