Creating a hillside meadow

Do you mow a hillside over and over, with little to show for your efforts? If so, consider transforming the area into a care-free wildflower meadow. Here’s how to do it:
A few reasons to make a hillside meadow
* A single annual mowing is usually sufficient to maintain such a meadow, rather than mowing it every several weeks.
* Meadow plants growing on a slope present an impressive picture that changes constantly as different species come in and out of bloom.
* Meadow gardens are always packed with intrigue. The show is a never-ending display of different plant combinations, usually pairing flowering plants with clump-forming grasses.
* The display is even more gratifying because very little site preparation goes into creating a meadow. When you seek out plants that thrive naturally in your climate and soil, the job is easy.
* After planting them once, many wildflowers multiply or reseed with no assistance on your part.
* You can use your saved time and energy to experiment with other flowers to add to the palette, fine-tuning your collection with each passing season.
Creating yard-sized meadows
They’re somewhat wild and woolly by nature, so wildflower meadows are best located a short distance from your house, separated from it by a swath of neatly mown turf.
* It serves as an open area, allowing you to stand back and admire the view.
* It also acts as a buffer zone for wildlife, which is naturally drawn to wildflower meadows.
* A short fence also helps to set apart a wildflower area. Fences lend a sense of importance, too, making the meadow look like an intentional garden rather than a happy accident.
* Start small with a wildflower meadow and expand as you need room for a growing collection of plants.
* Many of the flowers listed here have such strong constitutions that they seldom fail when given an opportunity to grow.
Mowing your meadow
In the interest of neatness, and to control tree seedlings and other woody weeds that inevitably pop up, a meadow should be mowed at least once a year, preferably in late fall.
* This job may be too rough for a mower, but it is easily tackled by a gas-powered weed trimmer equipped with a blade.
* Allow the debris to lie on the ground through winter as a mulch.
* Seeds may germinate under its protection, and it will prevent soil erosion.
* In early spring, rake open patches, loosen the top centimetre (half-inch) of soil with a hoe and, if desired, plant seeds of annuals like poppies, cosmos and larkspur.
While creating a meadow might seem like a lot of work, it is sure to save you time and energy throughout the year -- not to mention it looks beautiful! If you want to brighten up your yard and save time on mowing, a hillside meadow is the perfect addition to your property. -yellowpages
