Fitch affirms Kotagala Plantations at ‘CC(lka)’

Fitch Ratings has affirmed Sri Lanka-based Kotagala Plantations PLC’s National Long-Term Rating at ‘CC (lka)’. Fitch has also affirmed the National Rating on Kotagala’s outstanding senior secured debentures at ‘CC (lka)’.
The affirmation reflects the company’s continued weak liquidity profile despite improved revenue and EBITDA, asset disposals and restructuring of bank facilities over the previous 12 months. Kotagala had Rs 27 million of unrestricted cash and no unutilised credit facilities as at end-March 2018 (FY18) to meet Rs R671 million of short-term debt falling due in the next 12 months.
