Citizens' mail

Hang them till they are dead!
Have the UNHRC and EU overstepped their understanding in protesting to our government in passing death sentence to hang culprits engaged on mass scale narcotic peddling endangering the present and future young generations?
The EU has been reported as saying in a letter that the death penalty is incompatible with human dignity, and has not proven any deterrent effect, and allows judicial errors to become fatal and irreversible. Does this mean our judiciary, or as a matter of fact judiciaries all over the world have made these judicial errors? If there be, the number may be insignificant.
May I ask boldly, and maybe the voice of those who love to live a decent, peaceful life, is UNHRC and EU encouraging large-scale narcotic peddlers and for what reason? I would also question the UNHRC, whether encouraging birth control and termination of births are not a violation of Human Rights? It is high time that these organisations, which call for human rights, had limitations and drew the line, without making peace-loving people to live and not suffer.
The Buddha, the Christ and the Prophet Mohammed had preached against such crimes but have miserably failed.
It is therefore left to the law-abiding governments to impose whatever punishment for crimes, inclusive of the death penalty. In this case, there is no alternative but hang them till they are Dead! Dead! Dead!
