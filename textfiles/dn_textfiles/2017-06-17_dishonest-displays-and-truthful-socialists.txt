Dishonest displays and truthful socialists

Democratic people in this country are deeply concerned and worried about the recent continuing agitation and violence perpetrated against innocent women and men in Muslim and Christian communities in Lanka. We are told that 25 such attacks were made in the period April 16 to June 9. These were spread throughout the country. One can imagine the fear and hurt generated in the Muslim community in particular by these callous attacks. In the last few weeks pogroms have spread to cover Christian community too.
The entire population of Lanka should also be agitated and acutely aware of how easily these matters can explode out of control, as the history has shown again and again. Following hate speeches by fringe groups and a few religious leaders, a new wave of violence against Muslims and Christians in Lanka has been unleashed. Firstly number of mosques, homes and business enterprises owned by Muslims has been attacked. Attacks on Christian religious centres followed in the last few weeks. These events during April to June are extremely distressing and detrimental to national unity and harmony.
People thought the tragic memory of being torn apart by national conflict for over three decades in Sri Lanka is just beginning to fade. It is not easy. We have to defeat this vulgar attempt by a small minority to try to take us back to civil strife and even war. Public campaigns in the name of religion or nationality that pit religious or national communities against each other through hate speech and violence, threaten the prospects for meaningful reconciliation and national unity.
Religious freedom, harmony and co-existence
They must be resisted and replaced by a culture of religious freedom, harmony and co-existence. A particularly provocative and dangerous majoritist strand of thought running through this politics of hate and harm, is the assumption that the numerical majority - be it in terms of nationality and/or religion - is entitled to privileges and rights above those enjoyed by other citizens. This has serious and damaging implications for the future of Lanka as a united and functioning democracy, based on the rule of law and the equality of all of its citizens before the law.
Moreover, it flies in the face of the dream of pluralism given by the Yahapalanaya. We were told that peoples of multiple identities who enrich and enhance our country’s potential in every sphere, will be successful. They will come together too, to protect our pluralism and diversity and to celebrate them as sources of great strength to our collective well-being. Is it just a liberal dream?
“As patriotic citizens and organisations, we are alarmed by the increase in the number of acts of violence perpetrated against Muslims and Christians in this country. Since 2015, although the incidence of religious violence has decreased, it has not been completely eliminated as the statistics show. In recent months we are alarmed to note a resurgence of such religious hostilities both in acts of violence and speech.
We are equally alarmed that the government has not acted swiftly, decisively and proactively to curb this disturbing trend and call on the government and the law 

enforcement authorities to protect the right to freedom of religion of all groups in this country. This has been a historic tradition in Lankan society. It is also a universal principle and an intrinsic part of all democratic societies. Violence and hate speech should be prosecuted and the Police and Attorney General's Department should ensure that the rule of law is strictly observed and the law applied without discrimination.
Law enforcement officers will act when there is a clear message given by the political leadership. We ask the political leadership of this country including the President, the Prime Minister, and the Ministers of Justice and Law and Order, to issue clear instructions to those enforcing the law to prosecute violence and hate speech without fear or favour. We call on the Leader of the Opposition and of all political parties to strictly avoid any diversion of their political activities and discourse into communal hostilities and the targeting of particular religions,” stated one campaign document.
Fascistic racist politics
While we are fighting barbaric social tendencies left behind by the fascistic Mahinda regime, there is a trend, spread all over the world that wants to challenge the rise of fascistic racist politics. Latter came to lime light with the election of Donald Trump. Nobody expected the rise of Bernard Sanders as a radical socialist; he was an American politician who has been the junior United States Senator from Vermont since 2007. Sanders's campaign against Hillary Clinton for the party's 2016 U.S. presidential nomination projected him to be a new kind of socialist. He was helped by small women and men. A self-described democratic socialist, Sanders is pro-labor and emphasizes reversing economic inequality. Some say he is not a socialist and consider his views to be more in line with social democracy and New Deal-era American progressivism than democratic socialism. However while a student he was an active protest organiser for the Congress of Racial Equality and the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee during the Civil Rights Movement.
Sanders rose to national prominence after his 2010 filibuster against the Middle Class Tax Relief Act of 2010, which extended the Bush tax cuts that favoured the wealthiest Americans. He has built a reputation as a leading progressive voice on issues such as campaign finance reform, corporate welfare, global warming, income inequality, LGBT rights, parental leave, and universal healthcare. Sanders has long been critical of U.S. foreign policy and was an early and outspoken opponent of the Iraq War, the First Gulf War, and U.S. support for the Contras in Nicaragua.
He is also outspoken on civil liberties and civil rights, criticizing racial discrimination in the criminal justice system as well as advocating for privacy rights against mass surveillance policies such as the USA PATRIOT Act and the NSA surveillance programmes. All these put together he was often classified as a Marxist!
There are several political leaders who have challenged fascistic trends in their own political arenas. Several in Europe, but the emergence of Jeremy Corbyn, leader of the UK’s Labour Party, is most significant. He has made a remarkable comeback. His political obituary had been written by reactionary critiques and widely accepted even a few weeks ago. Tories, led by Theresa May, will still have the largest number of seats. But they have lost their majority, after calling the election in the belief that they would increase it. Surprisingly, Labour has picked up at least 29 seats. The result is a hung parliament. Observers have pointed to various historical causes that have brought Corbyn to his leadership position and kept him there, such as the failure of the centrist, neoliberal project of “New Labour” to provide economic security or even much of a future for the party’s working class base; or Tony Blair’s deeply unpopular foreign policy, including the Iraq War and the lies on which it was sold. Point they want make is Corbyn is not the cause of his victory!
On the other hand, many have made the comparison to Bernie Sanders, who despite losing his primary bid last year is currently the most popular active politician in the US, and is especially well-liked among younger people. The appeal of these two senior citizens to youth is striking, and it bodes well for the future. But one of the most important lessons of the Corbyn comeback is that the truth, so often dismissed as the first casualty of politics, can be an effective weapon. After the Manchester terrorist attack, Corbyn said something that no party leader in the US would say during an election campaign:
“Many experts, including professionals in our intelligence and security services, have pointed to the connections between wars our government has supported or fought in other countries and terrorism here at home.” Corbyn too opposed UK involvement in the wars in Afghanistan, Libya, Iraq, and Syria. British Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson, a man similar to Trump responded saying that Corbyn’s statement was “absolutely monstrous” and that it was “extraordinary and inexplicable in this week of all weeks that there should be any attempt to justify or to legitimate the actions of terrorists in this way.”
But these dishonest attacks, echoed by some of the UK’s largest media outlets, didn’t stick because people knew that Corbyn was telling the truth. A poll this week for The Independent in the UK found 75 percent in agreement that “interventions in Iraq, Afghanistan and Libya have made atrocities on UK soil more likely.”
There is an important lesson here: the only way to prevent perpetuating, the cycle of terrorism and foreign military intervention is to explain to people what is actually happening. President Obama actually said it for a few seconds in an interview with Vice News back in March 2015: “ISIL is direct outgrowth of al-Qaeda in Iraq, which grew out of our invasion.” Thus the “truthful socialist” world trend has started against the dishonest display of Trump and Putin. Lanka is one of the earliest to challenge fascistic politics with a victory to democracy. Still Lanka is fighting and struggle is not yet over. We expect the new trend will deliver better leaders in Lanka too!
