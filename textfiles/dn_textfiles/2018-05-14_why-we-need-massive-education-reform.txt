Why we need a massive education reform

I was happy to see that ‘The World Bank (WB) Board of Executive Directors has approved a US $100 million credit to support Sri Lanka’s efforts to strengthen and modernise its education system. It said: “The General Education Modernization Project (GEM) will modernize and diversify the curriculum of general education in keeping with the transformation taking place in Sri Lanka’s society and economy. Greater emphasis will be on strategic subjects that are key for economic development such as English and Mathematics.”
Only a few weeks ago I campaigned for a mass education programme for those who want to acquire a working knowledge of English language. English is available throughout Lanka but it does not come down to the working people. They are looking for it, earnestly; because it will empower them in social activity and labour market. I started from the Prime Minister and went around to meet several relevant ministers; also education specialists. At least one reason why some debates on politics of Marxism go down to the proletariat is lack of English at that level.
Some Polpotian Marxists repeat ‘This is a new, a new situation, and a new and higher level of struggle left behind by neoliberalism and new priorities corresponded to it. Globally the bourgeois-democratic stage had passed, and with it, the formal legal demand for national self-determination – characteristic of this stage – lost its former significance.
Polpotian Marxists
Hence the slogan “overthrow the rule of the bourgeoisie on a world scale and set up the international dictatorship of the proletariat” became the immediate practical slogan. Therefore, the concentration on national democratic tasks is outdated. This means that national self-determination lost all significance.’ So Polpotian Marxists in Lanka are preparing an immediate red revolution that could replace all democracy slogans with the “self-determination of the proletariat”. This would have been to ignore the presence of backward countries like Sri Lanka which had not completely passed through the stage of the bourgeois-democratic national revolution.
There was a massive struggle in Lanka for self-rule by Tamil nationality in Lanka and Polpotian Marxists launch a counter-revolution under the pretext of Desa Premi- patriotic movement. The result is a defeat for all with the devastation of the entire country.
The problem is not over and the second struggle has started. Liberal bourgeoisie led by the government has started a devolution and democracy programme with the intention of changing the constitution with constituent assembly. This is backed by the political leadership of minority nationalities. They hope to launch a Gandhian mass action to compel the government to go forward. Lankan proletariat led by Sama Samajists and other left leaders campaign for this effort.
As Lenin said ‘The modern proletariat of advanced countries had to support these movements; with all its strength it had to struggle so that the accumulation of centuries of ill will and the distrust by backward people of the dominant nations – and of the proletariat of these nations – was overcome as quickly as possible. It was impossible to achieve this goal without proclaiming and conducting in practice the right of national self-determination.
Moreover, even for a socialist society moving towards the elimination of classes the question of national self-determination still remains a real one, since although based on economics, socialism by no means consists solely of economics.
For the elimination of national subjugation, a necessary foundation is a socialist production, but it is also necessary to have a democratic organisation of the state; a democratic army etc. erected on this base.’ So, we see that Marxist teachers always stood for democracy contrary to Polpotian Marxists who have betrayed the fundamental principles of Marxism.
Eliminating national subjugation
By transforming capitalism into socialism the proletariat creates the possibility of eliminating national subjugation.
This is one of the pet phrases of Polpotian; but how on the earth people can construct socialism if they haven’t got the freedom that comes with democracy. Polpotian who construct one party one leader states of terror claim that all proletarians accept such terror regimes, as a protection from imperialist armed attacks.
This argument again should be accepted without any debate, international or local. On the other hand, this possibility of socialism with democracy is transformed into reality “only” – only upon the full establishment of democracy in all areas, the determination of borders according to “the sympathies of the population”, and the full freedom of secession. On this base, in its turn, the absolute elimination of the least national frictions and distrust develops in practice.
The accelerated movement towards the integration of nations will be completed when the state withers away.
The concept of the right of self-determination is difficult to understand and it needs time and effort. It cannot be digested in a situation of hate and repulsion. Polpotians, in their simplicity and terror mentality, are unable to understand the national problem. In this short discussion, attempt is made to show what rich material available for the study of the revolutionary dialectical approach to questions of law related to self-determination.
