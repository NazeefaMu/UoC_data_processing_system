Kandy SC keep clean sheet, but only just

Kandy Sports Club continued to maintain their unbeaten record when they gained a hard fought win over CR and FC on Sunday in Kandy. This was a second round encounter and like the first round it was a very close game.
Kandy SC did not have things their own way. It was their superior speed and better handling of the ball in the back division that brought them victory. The winners pocketed 15 points to the loser's 12.
Kandy SC took the field a depleted side without six of their regulars and had to fight hard to record their 12th consecutive win of the season. The brave CR and FC ruggerites came very near to creating the season's biggest upset and walked out of the ground with their heads held high. They shocked everyone by stretching Kandy SC to the limit.
CR and FC created huge pressure with territorial advantage gaining around 75% possession but lacked the finishing touches that led them to this defeat. In the second half CR and FC had more possession but lacked penetration to convert it into points due to many unforeseen errors.
CR three quarters had a poor game as they missed several opportunities of scoring. They had the momentum of scoring on several occasions but failed. Actually CR had only them to blame for the loss.
Kandy SC's acting skipper and scrum half Roshan Weerartne was the architect of their victory. His good passes, perfect dummying split the CR and FC defence. Whatever said and done the defending champions found scoring difficult owing to the plucky display by the Red shirts.
The very large gathering present was caught in a tense atmosphere for a major portion of the game, as the rugby what they expected did not emerge. Don't blame the referee; blame the players who failed to give their best.
