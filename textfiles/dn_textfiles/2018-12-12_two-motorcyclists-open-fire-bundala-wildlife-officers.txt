Two motorcyclists open fire at Bundala wildlife officers

Two motorcyclists had opened fire at a vehicle carrying several wildlife officers at the Bundala National Park on Saturday (8) night.
The wildlife officers caught one of them and handed him over to the Hambantota police. He was identified as a resident of Weligaththa, Bundala. The wildlife officers escaped without casualties but their vehicle was damaged in the attack.
The officers were returning to their office at Bundala after handing over three suspects who were transporting a buffalo with its legs tied to a safari jeep to Hambantota police.
The suspect was in an army uniform. An empty bullet was found from the location and another army uniform was found in the suspect's bag. A motorcycle and a torch were seized.
Police found two 12 bore cartridges, a mobile and a knife from the location.
Investigations are continuing.
