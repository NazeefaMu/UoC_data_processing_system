Puls8 holds fashion show with a difference

It was an evening of chic fashion and trendy designs as the graduating class of AIS hit the runway and presented a fashion show with a difference.
PULS8 Feel The Beat was held recently at the Kings Court Cinnamon Lakeside.
Over 500 people were entertained to an exciting show, with latest fashions and exotic finishes showcased by the aspiring models of the AIS  class of 2018.
This high octane evening of inspiring design and music was choreographed by Rashmin Sappideen.
Funds raised from this show were donated for charity.
