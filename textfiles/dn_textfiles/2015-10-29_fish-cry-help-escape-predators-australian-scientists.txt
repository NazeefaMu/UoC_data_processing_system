Fish cry for help to escape predators: Australian scientists

AUSTRALIA: Distressed fish caught by predators emit a cry for help to attract other carnivores so they can escape during the ensuing chaos, Australian scientists said Thursday.
While researchers had discovered that fish emit a chemical substance found in their skin when injured to alert others nearby of the dangers, they did not know whether the distress call also benefited the captured prey. "Within a minute (of the chemical alarm being emitted), you get this aggregation of little predators coming in," the study's co-author Mark McCormick of James Cook University told AFP, adding that most fish displayed similar behaviour.
"For them, it's like somebody ringing a dinner bell. So other predators swoop in... and start chasing the predator that first caught the little prey fish and in doing so, disrupt the initial predator. - AFP
