Drought continues in Anuradhapura

The drought situation continues in the Anuradhapura district. The water levels of the major tanks in the Anuradhapura district have been reducing steadily.
The majority of the 89 medium scale tanks and 3,000 minor irrigation tanks have gone dry creating a drinking water problem in the rural areas in the district. On the instructions of Anuradhapura District Secretary R.M.Wanninayake, 22 divisional secretaries are taking steps to dig temporary wells in tank beds and other suitable places to make drinking water available for the people.
Agrowells and tube wells rehabilitation programmes are in progress as a remedial measure solve water scarcity. Around 14,500 cultivation wells filled with sediment are being renovated and 1,500 tube wells are repaired.
The District Secretary has instructed the Agrarian Services Development Department and the district agriculture authorities to prepare cultivation plans for the 2017/2018 Maha cultivation seasons. He has directed the authorities to give priority to purchase 14,500 mt of seed paddy from the 2017 limited paddy cultivation in the district to distribute among the 120,000 drought hit farmers to enable them to start the Maha cultivation season.
Steps have been taken to grant fertilizer subsidy without delay, the District Secretary said.
