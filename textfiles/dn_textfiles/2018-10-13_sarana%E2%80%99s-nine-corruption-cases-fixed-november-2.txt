Sarana’s nine corruption cases fixed for November 2

The Colombo Chief Magistrate fixed nine corruption cases filed against former Deputy Minister Sarana Gunawardena for November 2.
The Bribery Commission had filed nine cases against Sarana Gunawardana for allegedly renting vehicles belonging to his relatives to the Lotteries Board, causing losses to the government.
Assistant Director General of the Bribery Commission appearing on behalf of the Bribery Commission pleaded time to amend the charge sheet. The Bribery Commission alleged that the accused had committed the offences between 2006 and 2007 when he was serving as the National Lotteries Board Chairman. Gunawardena is charged under Section 70 of the Bribery Act. The Magistrate ordered the Bribery Commission to submit an amended charge sheet before court. The case will be taken up on November 2.
