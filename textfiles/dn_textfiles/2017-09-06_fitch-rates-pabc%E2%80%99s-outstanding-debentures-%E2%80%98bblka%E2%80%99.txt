Fitch rates PABC’s outstanding debentures ‘BB+(lka)’

Fitch Ratings has assigned Pan Asia Banking Corporation PLC’s (PABC, BBB-(lka)/Stable) outstanding Sri Lanka rupee-denominated Basel II-compliant subordinated debentures a National Long-Term Rating at ‘BB+(lka)’.
The debentures mature in 2019 and amount to Rs 3 billion.
The outstanding subordinated debentures are rated one notch below PABC’s National Long-Term Rating to reflect their subordination to senior unsecured creditors. PABC’s National Long-Term Rating of ‘BBB-(lka)’ reflects declining capitalisation following its rapid growth in the past. The bank raised Rs 2.1 billion in March 2017 via a rights issue to increase its minimum regulatory capital to meet the Rs 7.5 billion target which was due on 1 January 2017.
PABC is required to increase this further to LKR10 billion by 1 January 2018. Fitch believes that the bank’s earnings retention alone is not likely to be sufficient to achieve the capital standards, despite improved profitability. The rating on the outstanding debentures will move in tandem with PABC’s National Long-Term Rating.
An upgrade of PABC’s rating is contingent upon the bank achieving a sustained and significant improvement in capitalisation, alongside a moderation in risk appetite. PABC’s rating would be downgraded if loss-absorption buffers deteriorate further, either through aggressive loan-book growth or a greater share of unprovided NPLs.
A full list of PABC’s ratings are as follows: National Long-Term Rating: ‘BBB-(lka)’; Outlook Stable Sri Lanka rupee-denominated senior unsecured debentures: ‘BBB-(lka)’ The following outstanding Basel II-compliant subordinated debentures are rated ‘BB+(lka)’: - Rs 1.91 billion 9.75% listed subordinated debentures due 2019 – Rs 1.09 billion 9.523% listed subordinated debentures due 2019
