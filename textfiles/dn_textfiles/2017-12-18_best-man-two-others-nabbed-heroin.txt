Best Man, two others nabbed with heroin

A 21-year-old youth was arrested by Matara police at the Denipitiya Junction with 130g of heroin yesterday.
In full suit, he had arrived at the junction to smoke heroin before accompanying his elder brother on his wedding day as his best man. Police arrested two other suspects along with him with 360 mg of heroin in their possession during the raid.
The first suspect had pleaded clemency saying he had to accompany his elder brother for his wedding but police had produced him in courts and other two suspects. The Matara Police Vice Squad carried out the raid.
