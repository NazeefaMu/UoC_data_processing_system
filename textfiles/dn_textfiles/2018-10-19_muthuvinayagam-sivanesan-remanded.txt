National Livestock Development Board bribery case
Muthuvinayagam, Sivanesan remanded

Colombo Chief Magistrate Ranga Dissanayake remanded National Livestock Development Board (NLDB) Chairman M.K. Muthuvinayagam and Kadiresu Sivanesan who were arrested for soliciting a bribe from a businessman, yesterday.
The Bribery Commission alleged that the NLDB Chairman had allegedly demanded Rs.1.2 million from a businessman to expedite the lease of a restaurant at the Malsiripura NLDB Farm.
However, it had been later negotiated for Rs.600,000. The Chairman had closed the deal through Kadiresu Sivanesan.
Sivanesan was sent to collect the bribe from the businessman and based on a complaint made by the said businessman, Bribery Commission officers had witnessed the incident. After acquiring the cash, Sivanesan had called the NLDB Chairman to confirm the deal.
President’s Counsel Anil Silva with President’s Counsel Jayantha Weerasinghe, appearing on behalf of the first suspect, told court that his client was suffering from heart disease and diabetes.
He pleaded that his client be granted bail considering his diseases as a special circumstance.
The Attorney-at-Law appearing on behalf of the second suspect said that his client was still doing his higher studies. He said that the accused was to sit for his CIMA examination in November and hence, asked that he be granted bail.
The Magistrate fixed the order for October 23.
