Programme to dig wells in Anuradhapura

The Divisional Secretaries in the Anuradhapura district were instructed to dig common wells in tank beds, reservation lands and other suitable locations where underground water could be available.
Anuradhapura Government Agent R. M. Wanninayake told the Daily News that this programme is being implemented according to the directives given by President Maithripala Sirisena during his recent visit to Kebithigollewa to gather first-hand information about drought-hit farmer families.
The Government Agent said under the first phase, 50 wells would be dug and the first 15 wells would be in Padaviya and Kebithigollewa DS Divisions.
It is observed that the underground water level in many jurisdictions had been decreasing. The water supply of the community based rural water supply schemes are also disrupted due to the prevailing drought.
“We are now planning to distribute water through bowsers. However, we face difficulties in finding suitable water sources close to affected areas.
“At present, around 60,000 people in 12 DS division in the district are being provided with drinking water through bowsers,” the Government Agent said.
