Three more state medical faculties by 2025

Three more state medical faculties will be opened by 2025 in three state universities, Health Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne said.
A total of 1,500 quarters will be constructed countrywide with the assistance of a foreign investment. Several state hospitals in the country will be developed according to European standards, Minister Senaratne said.
He was speaking at the opening of several projects at the Nuwara Eliya General Hospital recently.
Minister Senaratne said arrangements have already been made to double the human resources of the nursing cadre, paramedics and other categories. Nuwara Eliya and Hambantota General Hospitals will be constructed with the assistance of the Netherlands.
Nuwara Eliya General Hospital constructed with Dutch assistance will open before April 2019.
This government has received foreign investment, whereas the previous regime had taken 33 percent of indirect loans without records and this government has to re-pay those loans, he said.
