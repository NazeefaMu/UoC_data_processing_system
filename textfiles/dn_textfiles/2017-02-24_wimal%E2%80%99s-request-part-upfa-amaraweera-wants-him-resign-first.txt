Wimal’s request to part from the UPFA: Amaraweera wants him to resign first

UPFA General Secretary and Minister Mahinda Amaraweera yesterday asked NFF Leader Wimal Weerawansa to send his letter of resignation from the UPFA to him, so that a decision on it could be taken immediately.
The Minister made this comment in Parliament yesterday, reacting to a request made by NFF Leader Wimal Weerawansa to sit as an independent group in Parliament.
“The NFF contested the elections from the UPFA, but it is not a constituent party in the UPFA. If he makes this request from us we can consider it without delay. We are in a drive to restructure and strengthen the party. The NFF members got elected to Parliament exploiting the SLFP voter base. They will come to know their real power when they separate from our party” he said.
Replying to this statement MP Wimal Weerawansa said that he had already drafted the letter and that it would be handed over to Amaraweera before he leaves the chamber.
“I believe you have no intention to retain us in the Alliance forcibly. Please be kind enough to accept the letter and inform the Speaker in that regard” he said.
Amaraweera agreeing to this said the decision would be communicated soon.
