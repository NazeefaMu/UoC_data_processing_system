British yoga instructor left fighting for life after crash in SL

A British yoga instructor has been left fighting for life after a horrific crash in Sri Lanka. Ivana Tensek’s family are now desperately trying to raise £50,000 to bring her back to London and cover her medical costs.
The yoga teacher and keen surfer was forced to undergo a 12-hour operation after the severe collision last Thursday left her with broken bones in her legs, pelvis and hands.
She is now in a “critical” condition in a Sri Lankan hospital and her family are trying to get her home so she can receive the best care possible.Close friend Yenabi Talitha-Cumi Araújo said: “Unfortunately Ivana was involved in a serious collision on the streets of Sri Lanka.
“It resulted in the need for 12 hour operation and has left her hospitalised in ICU with severely broken bones in her hands, legs and pelvic area.”
“Ivana was due to return back to the UK in less than a week but she is in a stable but critical situation and time is of the essence to get her back home to London.”
Yenabi, who set up the GoFundMe page, said Ivana’s family is hoping to get her home on a medical transport flight to London.
She wrote: “We are trying to raise £50,000 so that she can return to her family and friends as quickly as possible and get the best medical care possible to make a full recovery.”
Friends, family and well-wishers have so far raised more than £15,000.
Ivana has been described as an “inspirational” woman with the “brightest smile and most selfless soul”.“Ivana is a loving daughter, a cherished sister, a protective aunt and loyal friend,” the campaign page reads.
“At her core she is a girl who loves life and lives every day as an adventure but she also lives to help people and the environment.
“She has travelled the world looking for new adventures and experiences and flourishes on making new friends and finding ways to help people.” Ivana was working as a yoga instructor at Hangtime Hostel near Matara, Sri Lanka, in the weeks before her accident. Close friend Felix Rohlin wrote on Facebook: “An incredible woman and good friend of mine Ivana Tensek has had the worst imaginable accident happen to her.“The injuries are severe and she needs help.” (The Sun)
