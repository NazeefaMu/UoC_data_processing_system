Ceylinco Life policyholders on tour to Singapore

The ‘holiday season’ continues for policyholders of Ceylinco Life, with another batch of 50 policyholders and their families being accorded a three-day, all-expenses-paid visit to Singapore, under the life insurance leader’s ‘Family Savari’ mega promotion.
Just days after the conclusion of a visit to Dubai by a group of 40, nearly 200 more visited the Lion City, where they were treated to visits to the sea aquarium, Fountain of Wealth, China Town and Garden by the bay, and spent a full day shopping.
The group was accommodated at one of Singapore’s best four-star hotels and was accompanied by the popular actress and television personalitySanjeewani Weerasinghe, one of the Brand Ambassadors for the Family Savari programme.
This was the third batch of winners in the 10th edition of Ceylinco Life’s Family Savari programme. In May, nearly 2,000 members of policyholder families spent a day at the Leisure World theme park, in addition to the 40 that toured Dubai.
Another five policyholder families have won a holiday in England – the grand prize in this edition of the Ceylinco Life Family Savari.
The annual promotion is intended to increase penetration of life insurance and to reward policyholders for keeping their policies active and is the largest customer promotion in Sri Lanka’s insurance industry. A total of 2,260 people win overseas holidays or the local excursion from Ceylinco Life every year through the Family Savari programme.
The total number of people benefitted by the promotion to date is 20,000.
The Ceylinco Life Family Savari promotion has as its Brand Ambassadors the Sri Lankan actors Sriyantha Mendis, Sanjeewani Weerasinghe and Roshan Ranawana and Kushlani Ranawana who participate in the Savari outings and overseas tours.
The market leader in Sri Lanka’s life insurance sector since 2004, Ceylinco Life has close to a million lives covered by active policies.
