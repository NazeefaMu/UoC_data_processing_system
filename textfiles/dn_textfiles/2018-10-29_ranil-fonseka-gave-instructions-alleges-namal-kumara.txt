Assassination plot against President, former Defence Secretary
Ranil, Fonseka gave instructions, alleges Namal Kumara

In a special media conference held yesterday (27), Anti-Corruption Force Operations Director Nalaka Kumara alleged that former Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe and former Minister Field Marshal Sarath Fonseka are behind giving instructions to the assassination plot against President Maithripala Sirisena and former Defence Secretary Gotabhaya Rajapaksa. According to Kumara, DIG Nalaka Silva received instructions from Wickremesinghe and Fonseka to use Makandure Madush in the assassination plot.
Kumara requested President Maithripala Sirisena and Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa to offer a general amnesty to DIG Nalaka Silva after deriving evidence from him as to who the masterminds behind the assassination plot against the President.
Kumara pointed out that he does not have “evidence” against the accused, but said that he is revealing what he knows.
“I did not speak a word of this even when I was at the CID. If I did, they would have asked for evidence. Everyone starts to ask for evidence. This is the sorry situation now in this country. When someone makes a revelation, they ask for evidence from us. Instead, they should be looking for evidence. Due to this very reason, a number of crimes go unsolved,” Kumara pointed out.
Kumara made these observances at a press brief was held at his residence in Ampara, Mahaoya, Samagipura.
Kumara appeared for the press brief accompanied by his father and mother.
“I am here to divulge an unsaid story of the assassination plot against the President and the former Defence Secretary. At the press conference, I held on October 24, I mentioned that I know of Sarath Fonseka being behind this assassination plot. I also requested the President to give me a chance to meet him privately for ten minutes. I told the media, that there are other parties involved in this plot. I said that I will speak of those, if the President wants me to speak. I also requested to meet the President for ten minutes. Why did I make such an attempt? Now that proper proper background has been created, I can tell the whole country what I was going to tell the President privately,” Kumara said.
“I wanted to meet the President to tell him that it was Field Marshal Sarath Fonseka and former Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe who gave instructions to DIG Nalaka Silva about using Makadure Madush in this plot. I know this for a fact. I didn’t have a chance to tell this earlier. If I said this, nothing would have come out of it since both law and justice were backing them. I don’t have evidence to prove this. I asked for ten minutes from the President to tell what I know. But now, I can tell this to the whole country. I don’t have to tell you what would have happened if I told this earlier. Now I know he is not in a position to attack me. Now I have no problem. I have said everything that was on my mind,” Kumara further said.
Speaking further, Kumara observed that DIG Nalaka Silva was not involved in this assassination plot for personal reasons and pointed out that he was only a pawn in the game.
“Remember this, when Nalaka Silva designed this plot and contacted Makadure Madush for this plot, he didn’t do it for personal reasons. In my personal view, it is alright to give a general amnesty to Nalaka Silva if he can reveal as to who are really behind this assassination plot. After getting this evidence from Silva, I request the President, as a leader who promotes non-violence, and the Prime Minister to grant a general amnesty to Nalaka Silva after finding out as to who were behind designing this plot and bring those people to justice. I have nothing personal against Silva and have no intention of taking revenge against him,” Kumara also said.
