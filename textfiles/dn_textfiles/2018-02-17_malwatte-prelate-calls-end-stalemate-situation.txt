Malwatte Prelate calls to end stalemate situation

Malwatte Chapter Mahanayake, Most Ven Thibbotuwawe Sri Sumangala Thera in a letter has cautioned President Maithripala Sirisena and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe.
The chief prelate said that the present deadlock the country has fallen into, following the Local Government election, may lead to the collapse of the country’s economy and the public administration system, if the trend continued further.
The Thera is of the view that all parties in unison should strive to fullfil the promises given to the people at the last Presidential and Parliamentary elections, a reality soon.
The Thera added that the looming instability and uncertainty in the country in the aftermath of the Local Government election impedes peace and harmony and reconciliation efforts. He earnestly requested the government to ease the cost of living of farmers, labourers and the middle class of the country.
“Specific attention should also be drawn on promoting peace, reconciliation, culture and religious amity, while strengthening the country’s economy,” the chief prelate said.
