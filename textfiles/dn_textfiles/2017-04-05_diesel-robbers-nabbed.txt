Diesel robbers nabbed

Three suspects trying to siphon diesel from a bowser transporting fuel from Trincomalee and replace the drawn diesel with an equal amount of kerosene oil along a by-road at Gantalawa, Kantale were nabbed by the Kantale police during the night of April 3.
Police seized 420 litres of diesel drawn out from the browser and a batta lorry with 460 litres of kerosene oil brought in it for diluting into the bowser. The three suspects include the driver and the assistant of the bowser.
The suspects were produced before the Kantale Magistrate. Investigations are continuing.
