Police should work for benefit of public- President

President Maithripala Sirisena stressed that the Police Department has to work at an optimal level for the benefit of the public.
President Sirisena made these remarks when he met with Senior DIGs and DIGs at the Presidential Secretariat, yesterday.
He further stressed the importance of creating a conducive environment for everyone in the service to work in a satisfactory manner.
“It is necessary to sort out all issues and problems related to the field through discussions and dialogues,” the President said.
Meanwhile, President Sirisena gave instructions to senior Police officers to set up a new Committee comprising the representatives from the Law and Order Ministry, Police Department and the Presidential Secretariat to look into the grievances of the lower ranking Police personnel.
He also emphasised the importance for the Police to discharging its duties according to a viable plan by identifying the challenges levelled against them. He said the Police must act in an impartial manner and discharge its duties by winning the public trust.
President Sirisena also urged the IGP to submit the report on drug detection during the last three months and keep him updated through monthly reports on drug detections. He also said a strong programme should be formulated to curb the underworld activities.
