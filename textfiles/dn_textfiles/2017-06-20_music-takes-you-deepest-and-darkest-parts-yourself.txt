Music takes you to the deepest and the darkest parts in yourself

“You can travel into the deepest and the darkest parts in yourself through music,” says Nadeeka Guruge. He points out that music is a huge phenomena, and he himself is the promise of this wonder. He is a man who has proved himself in the music industry due to his huge and devoted following in Sri Lanka.
“Music has been my way of expression since I was a kid. I was away from my family in a hostel during my young age. Whenever I was homesick I used to whistle the melodies and the songs that my family used to listen to and the songs that we used to sing together. So it was kind of a nostalgic feeling for me,” said Guruge.
Music was certainly therapeutic to him.
“And I remember that I felt better as I just let the music carry all my sadness away from me. So at the beginning Music was a kind of nostalgic thing which could take me away from real life. As I grew up, I felt that I needed more ways to express myself musically, so I started playing the "Harmonica". Both my father and my elder brother used to play the Harmonica beautifully. And then as my musical thoughts grew bigger I needed to learn to play the Guitar. When I was about 12 years old myself and my elder brother were sent to a piano teacher but fortunately or unfortunately we both never enjoyed the piano lessons,” stated Guruge
In the end they both ended up playing guitars.
Traditional Sri Lankan folk music
“After my school education I moved to Colombo from Nuwaraeliya and joined legendary Sri Lankan composer maestro Premasiri Kemadasa's choir as a bass singer. Under him and a few other leading Vocal instructors such as Christeen Perera and Ivor Dennis, I studied both western Classical and Sri Lankan Folk Music. After about 2 years I went back to Nuwaraeliya and started researching Sri Lankan folk traditions. In 1999, me and my elder brother Sumudu Guruge produced an album with a Bolivian Folk Musician Marcello Titto Li.
“It was a collection of traditional Sri Lankan and Bolivian folk music and applied music. I eventually entered Sri Lankan Sinhala theater and composed music for many stage plays since late '90s. From the theater I moved to television drama and then to cinema. I think it’s not only music that made me an icon I am now. It is being a social activist and being in many other platforms as well,” pointed out Guruge.
Music was for Guruge, a way of getting away from the real life.
“But eventually it became the other way around. I started seeing society and people closely, I knew it was not what I saw. I started to express what I saw and experienced in society through a musical context. When I started composing for stage plays, television drama and especially for cinema, I used more musical materials to construct my view. From that point music really became the most essential part of my expression,” added Guruge
Love and sexuality
Initially Guruge wrote songs about social inequality and other social issues.
“I started as a song writer and a singer. I wrote songs about the love and sexuality in the hidden culture and the surface. One of the earliest songs of mine was called "Romeo Married ( Wedikawe)" it was a good example for my early writings and music. I make it a point to write my own songs, at least I used to. I always believe that I cannot feel life the way that someone else would do. But recently I sang a song called "Lelasiye" written by Chaaminda Rathnasuriya who is a revolutionary Sri Lankan Lyricist of the Millennia. I do a Concert once in every 2 years called "NostalGuitar". You can listen to all my songs at the concert. We are planning on having it on the August 2017,” explained Guruge. Guruge has so far produced one album called "Sanyugma/ Encuentro" which was not released officially as the Music producers at that time said that it's not Marketable.
“I have written and composed many songs and recorded some of them. My hardcore fans find them and share them with each other. It was a big moment for me when I was awarded the "Best Stage Drama Music" for the first time at the State Drama Festival in late '90 s. Since then I have got the Best Music Award for Stage drama till 2010. Another milestone is my first ever movie score got selected for the most appropriate Category at the UK film awards in 2005. And the movie won "Camera D'or award" in Cannes International Film Festival.
Since then almost all my Movie scores have been awarded or recognized both locally and at International Film Festivals. I remember there was a review in the New York times Magazine one the Movie "Sankara" 2008. They called the Score "Divine Music". I won the OCIC Cygnis award for the score. In 2013 I received most prestigious "BUNKA International" award from Japan for my Contribution to Sri Lankan Cinema,” shared Guruge.
Broader dimensions through musical expressions
Guruge tries to explore broader dimensions through musical expressions.
“I have written some music for different types of instruments to explore these wider dimensions. Movies are a good platform to work on in that case. In a movie score you have a type of a freedom to bring out the inner soul of the Movie. For example I wrote a String Quartet for a movie called "Swaroopa" by legendary Dr. Dharmasena Pathiraja, based on the famous "Metamorphosis" by Franz Kafka.
Music is the first ever medium that early man expressed feelings with each other. Language came long after. Actually music is the fundamental element of language say the Anthropologists. Music has been in us through our evolution. Rhythm comes with bipedalism. It’s really interesting to know that man who lived 30,000 years ago, also showed "Musical Behavior". Anthropologists have identified a part of a flute made out of the bone of a bird in a cave which was inhabited by Homo Neanderthals 30,000 years ago in Slovenia. This shows how much music meant to mankind. Music most importantly is intrapersonal communication.You can travel in to the deepest and the darkest parts in yourself through music,” explained Guruge. Music is a huge phenomena. Anyone can express their feelings musically and lyrically.
“All over the world there are fans for each and every type of music from classical to metal. In Sri Lanka we shouldn't forget that our contemporary music culture is very young comparatively to Indian and Western music. During the last decades of colonization only the Sri Lankan Elite realized that we no longer have our own Musical identity. It was all gone with the transformation from old feudalism to neo-feudalism. Some went to Europe in search of our musical roots and some went to India in search of elements to create a Sri Lankan Musical tradition. It's a long story,” noted Guruge
Different types of audiences
During the 60's and 70's there was a new wave of Sinhala pop music emerging with the direct influence of the "Capital" or the "Producer".
“These two streams represented the socio political inner self of the society. By the 90's the semi classical genre was overtaken by the "pop" genre with modern technology. The Millennia marks the emergence of neo modern pop music all over the world. Young musicians and singers even lyricists got under the direct influence from the icloud but still we see a lack of creativity in that genre. But technique wise young musicians got themselves well equipped by the youtube and other sources. It took about one week for us to listen to a song and to pick up a guitar lick on radio back then. But now you can pick a lick in a second on youtube. You can put down the tempo and figure out the exact fingering patterns and the techniques. I see a lot of better guitarists in our generation as a result of that. But again we need more creativity also,” clarified Guruge.
Guruge has traveled abroad and displayed his prodigious talent.
“It was in 2002 when I first traveled abroad for a Folk Music Festival in Norway called "Furde Music Festival". There I performed with 3 Kenyan Musicians and 3 Norwegian Musicians. It was mainly for the Folk Musicians from all over the world. After that I traveled to a couple of places like Egypt, Switzerland, India and Australia. When it comes to differentiating between audiences abroad and here there is no big difference I would say when it comes to loving music. All over the world there are different types of audiences for different types of musical genres. Obviously you can’t complain after singing Folk to a Heavy Metal Audience,” pointed out Guruge Guruge considers himself fortunate to grow up in a remote aria called Nuwara Eliya.
“It was not a big town back then in early 80's with less people to associate with and less musical or social events to attend. All we had was the record player, radio and later on the Cassette player. My father and mother were talented musically even though my father was in the agriculture field. He could play the Guitar, Harmonica and could sing and whistle beautifully. My mother sang in the school choir, so she could sing beautifully. I remember the days that we used to sing sitting by the fireplace. I have two sisters and two brothers and we all used to sing,” He summed up the conversation.
