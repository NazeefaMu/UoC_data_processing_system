The highflyers behind Ceylinco Life’s sector-leading growth in 2016 were recognised by the life insurance leader when they honoured 247 members of its sales and non-sales teams with performance awards in 20 categories at the company’s annual awards recently.
A total of 395 awards, which included certificates, medals, trophies and air tickets to Singapore, Malaysia, Thailand, Dubai and the UK for the winners and their family members, were presented at this gala event at the BMICH, with which Ceylinco Life celebrated its 13th successive year ofmarket leadership in Sri Lanka.
Staff members, sales consultants, unit heads and branch heads from the Ceylinco Life head office and more than 250 branches in every district of the country were recognised for their contribution to the company’s stellar results last year, with top performers winning multiple awards.
Among those honoured were 44 of members of Ceylinco Life’s sales force who qualified for the Million Dollar Round Table (MDRT) in 2016, two MDRT members among them who achieved Court Of Table status, and 91sales officers inducted into the company’s own High Flyers’ Club last year. Speaking at the event, Ceylinco Life Managing Director and CEO R. Renganathan quoted football legend Pelé to emphasise the importance of hard work, perseverance, learning, sacrifice and love for what one is doing, in achieving victory.
He also disclosed that the efforts of the company to find a convenient channel for policyholders to pay their premiums had borne fruit in 2016 with Ceylinco Life’s milestone partnership with the Postal Department. More than 4,000 post offices now accept premiums for Ceylinco Life policies, and the channel is emerging as an effective payment option for policyholders, Renganathan said.
In his address, Chief Guest Professor Sampath Amaratunge, Vice Chancellor of the University of Sri Jayewardenepura focussed on the need for individuals to understand themselves and their faults and limitations in order to succeed. Individuals that do not know themselves cannot correct their own faults and consequently cannot correct others, he said.
