No tax relief for  sugary drinks - Rajitha

No tax relief will be offered for manufacturers of sugary drinks even though they had made a request for a tax relief, Health Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne had stated.
Minister Senaratne had stated that a tax of 50 cents had been imposed by the Budget on every extra gram of sugar contained in sugary drinks and these drinks should contain only the recommended number of grams of sugar which is six (6). He had stated this during a recent ceremony held in Colombo.
The World Bank has provided US $ 200 million to control Non Communicable Diseases (NCDs) in Sri Lanka. Excessive consumption of sugar cause diabetes which is one of the common NCDs prevailing in Sri Lanka at the moment, the Minister said.
According to the WHO, about 70 percent of world’s deaths are due to NCDs and annually about five million people die from diabetes in the world. The new tax imposed on extra grams of sugar in sugary drinks will not be removed on any grounds, the Minister said.
