Two looks for Sivakarthikeyan

‘Seema Raja’ is screening at Capitol, MC - Colombo, Concord, MC - Jaffna and other film halls islandwide
Last seen in the blockbuster film ‘Velaikkaran’, Sivakarthikeyan’s latest entertainer ‘Seema Raja’ is now screening in film halls across the island.
Directed by Ponram of ‘Varuthapadatha Valibar Sangam’ fame, Sivakarthikeyan sports two looks for the film. ‘Seema Raja’ has Samantha Akkineni pairing up with Sivakarthikeyan for the first time in her career.
Produced by 24 AM Studios, ‘Semma Raja’ is tipped to be an out-and-out comedy film and has music by D Imman. The film also stars Napoleon, Simran, Soori, Yogi Babu, Manobala and Sathish in important roles. The first look poster was launched earlier this year, which received good response from the audience.
Post ‘Seema Raja’, Sivakarthikeyan is expected to start work on his next with director M Rajesh, which is said to be a romantic comedy.
