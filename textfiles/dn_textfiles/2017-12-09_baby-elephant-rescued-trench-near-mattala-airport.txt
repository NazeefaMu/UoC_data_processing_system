Baby elephant rescued from trench near Mattala airport

Wildlife officials yesterday rescued a she elephant and a baby elephant struck in an unprotected trench opposite the Mattala International Airport.
The officials rushed to the scene when they received information yesterday morning. Officials faced difficulty in rescuing the baby elephant as the she elephant that came out of the trench first was hovering around the officials.
The baby elephant was rescued after veterinary surgeons of the Wildlife Department anasthetised the She elephant. They were later released to the forest.
