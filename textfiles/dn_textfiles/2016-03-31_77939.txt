I will never leave the SLFP - Nimal

 
Transport Minister Nimal Siripala de Silva yesterday said that he would never leave the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) and would die as an SLFP member and not as a UNPer. "I did not receive any invitation from the UNP to join the party. All media reports on this topic are fabricated," Minister de Silva asserted.
Addressing the media in Colombo yesterday he said that he spent 35 years in the SLFP and SLFP policies are in his blood.
I have no intention whatsoever to leave my party. I joined the Government and now holding this Ministerial post because of the decision taken by the Central Committee of the SLFP.
I will go home and not to the UNP when I leave politics", he emphasized.
Highways State Minister Dilan Perera said that the SLFP segment in the Government is equal to the UNP segment and are are equal partners.
The SLFP is no low cast and the UNP is not high cast. Everything will converge in the middle The SLFP always give priority for what is best for the country.
It is very pathetic to see how some political parties which set fire and destroyed valuable resources in the country are now trying to fish in troubled waters.
President Maithripala Sirisena has given the power of the SLFP to the 'sufferers' now and not to the persons who inherited power in the SLFP. It is now the time of the 'sufferers'.
"We will take the party forward without breaking it. No one or nothing was able to break the SLFP in the past and it will be the same in the future," he added.
