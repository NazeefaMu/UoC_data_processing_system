B.C.C. Ltd to be refurbished

The State-owned undertaking of B.C.C. Ltd, which is renowned for its high quality coconut oil products, has planned to refurbish and modernise its two production factories at a cost of Rs. 780 million.
This is to offer an increased range of coconut oil products to consumers, B.C.C. Ltd Chairman Sarath Abeysinghe said.
He added that the refurbishment and modernisation plan, drawn up on the directive of the Enterprise Development Minister, has been submitted for Cabinet approval.
The two factories are situated at Miraniya Street, Colombo and Wathupitiwala.
He said there had been increased export orders for the company's products in recent times. They hoped to service this export demand while providing preference to local consumers.
