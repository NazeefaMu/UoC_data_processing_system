Treading life mindfully

Some need ‘Mindfulness’ to further improve our lives, to grow spiritually, to raise our standards of living and develop the mind. Then there are those who need ‘Mindfulness’ to help us overcome depression, anxiety and many more mental ailments. Director of the Mindfulness Initiative UK Jamie Bristow was in Sri Lanka to attend and speak at the Global Mindfulness Summit held in Colombo recently. Bristow spoke to the Daily News on the Mind’s capacity to overcome these distresses and evolve spiritually.
“Global Mindfulness Summit is a conference with international speakers. And I think it is important for us to share our experiences on mindfulness with the rest of the world. We are from different parts of the world so we can definitely learn from each other. So I am here to learn and share some of the success that we have had in the UK,” said Bristow.
Bristow is the Director of the Mindfulness Initiative, a policy institute that works with politicians around the world who practice mindfulness. The Mindfulness Initiative grew out of a mindfulness training program in the UK Parliament, which has seen over 140 politicians take an eight-week training course, and provides the secretariat to the Mindfulness All-Party Parliamentary Group.
“I am proud to be the Director of perhaps the world’s first think tank about mindfulness, thinking how mindfulness can be helpful in different areas of public life. I work in that role with the politicians in the House of Commons and the House of Lords in the British Parliament,” said Bristow.
Bristow’s life has been transformed by Mindfulness. This movement is generating much interest globally. Bristow and others like him have experienced this life changing science.
“The reason I advocate Mindfulness, is because it has helped me so much, like so many people who are in this area teaching mindfulness. Our lives have been transformed and we think that other people should know about this. And we want to find some way of sharing this. I was lucky enough to train in mindfulness when I was in university. And then when I was working in a corporate environment I was really stressed and I practiced it a lot more as I was convinced that it was very helpful and then I spent the next 10 years trying to find a way to share it with other people,” pointed out Bristow.
An anxiety disorder is one of the most distressing forms of mental ailments because the mind and the brain is basically acting against itself. Depression is another distressing ailment that many people suffer from.
“In terms of society there is really strong evidence that mindfulness in a hospital or clinical environment is very helpful for different types of mental health issues particularly recurrent depression and anxiety. There is also evidence that it helps in different physical health problems, as well as helping people to be their very best and to flourish,” explained Bristow.
Politicians and Business leaders, and any body for that matter can have benefits from learning how to be in control of their lives and becoming aware of themselves and the world around them.
The mind is like an ocean. Swim in it as deeply as you would want to. Unlock the power of the mind. Train it and develop it.
“Mindfulness is probably best understood as a capacity of mind. It is a little like language acquisition, the capacity to learn languages. Some people have developed that capacity more than others. Those who are more mindful tend to be better decision makers. They tend to be more resilient to psychological problems to psychological distress. They tend to have more satisfying relationships. We have this natural level of mindfulness that we can cultivate more of, through practice and training and essentially through meditation. So these mindfulness training programs help us develop more of that capacity,” added Bristow.
There are a variety of mental ailments such as Schizophrenia, Obsessive Compulsive Disorder, and Depression etc. There is a very special form of Mindfulness training developed specifically for those with such health problems.
“The main one is M-B-C-T (Mindfulness Based Cognitive Therapy). It is a combination of very ancient techniques that were proposed by the Buddha 2,500 years ago. And this is combined with very modern cognitive science theories. And in an eight week course, you learn how to meditate in very ancient ways. And you also learn about the mind in very new ways. And that course, has been proved to be helpful with the above mentioned disorders,” elucidated Bristow.
When it comes to poverty all the initiative can do is to help politicians make better decisions. Help them to develop empathy, understanding and feelings the emotions of others.
“We hope those politicians who practice mindfulness feel what it is like to be in other peoples’ shoes and they will be better able to address the needs of those who struggle the most with poverty. There is also evidence or signs that Mindfulness is changing what people want in life. Our priorities are shifted from making money and instead are focused on a world with better values. This will hopefully address the problem of poverty,” explained Bristow.
Bristow feels that there are a lot of people who need these programs but it is not widely available. So he pointed out the need for more governing bodies to get together and make these programs available to everyone. They work with the National Health Service in the UK, they work with police, politicians and public services and prison services.
“So in some cases the governing bodies acting on these recommendations have put in a lot of more money into mindfulness training for depression for instance. In the UK we are seeing a lot of developments in prisons and our programs are supported by the department of education in schools,” said Bristow.
Bristow pointed out that the wonderful thing was that the politicians themselves have recognized the need for mindfulness. This is a huge step in the fight against poverty or mental illness. The people at the top are interested in it and the people at the top have felt the need for change and they have heard the cries of the victimized. Politicians are talking to other politicians about the change they want to see in the society.
“There are many religious traditions now that have adopted mindfulness practice such as Christianity, Islam and Hinduism. They all have elements of mindfulness practice - training the mind to be more aware and present. Mindfulness is mushrooming all around the world. These practices can be found in a lot of ancient traditions. I really believe that mindfulness can help us tackle society’s most difficult problems,” said Bristow.
Mindfulness is able to make us aware of our thoughts without necessarily believing those thoughts are facts. So for instance when treating depression, we have the thought that says –‘you are a worthless person’ to that you say – ‘oh that is just a thought. It is in my mind but I don’t have to believe that is true’. And hence you don’t get depressed. Similarly with Schizophrenia, they have thoughts and voices telling them to do certain things that could be violent for instance. But by learning they are just thoughts and not facts, we learn to overcome those thoughts.
