Lankan passenger carrying gold in rectum caught at Vizag airport

Customs officials of the Air Intelligence Unit at the Vizag Airport detained an international passenger on the charges of carrying gold biscuits in his rectum on Sunday.
Refusing to reveal the identity of the passenger, the officials said he had landed at the city airport in a Sri Lankan Airways flight around 9.30 am.
Initially, it was suspected that he was carrying cocaine, but a senior officer, on condition of anonymity, said the passenger was trying to smuggle gold bars.
“The person could be carrying around 800 grams of gold,” he said. Customs officials grew suspicious of the passenger’s behaviour as he was walking “awkwardly” and rushed through the green channel meant for passengers carrying non-dutiable goods.
Officials detained him and conducted confirmatory screening tests which revealed that he was carrying something in his rectum. Sources identified the passenger as Abdul Razak, 50, who flew in from Colombo. Officials are yet to confirm the information.
The passenger has been sent to the King George Hospital for a total body scanning procedure. Police denied having any official information about the incident. - The New Indian Express
