UPFA member tries to assault Balangoda UC Chairman

Pandemonium reigned at the Balangoda Urban Council meeting yesterday as a governing party member belonging to the UPFA tried to assault Chairman Chamika Jayamina Wimalasena who presided over the meeting. The Council was briefly adjourned and sittings began later under police protection.
After the sittings resumed, the offending governing party member Nimal Gamini Weerasinghe complained of a chest pain and left the chamber saying he was going to get hospitalised.
The monthly meeting commenced at 8.08 am. Six UNP council members joined hands with three UPFA members to set up the administration in the Balangoda UC.
The Council Opposition comprises seven SLPP members and one JVP member. The SLPP members attended the meeting wearing black bands and holding placards.
UPFA member and former chairman Nimal Gamini Weerasinghe attended the meeting wearing a mask, black band and holding a placard with the question, ‘What fate has befallen this picturesque city?’
