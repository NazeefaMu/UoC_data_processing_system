GMOA warns of further strikes

The Government Medical Officers’ Association (GMOA) will launch a joint strike if the Government does not announce the solution to the SAITM issue shortly, GMOA Secretary Dr. Haritha Aluthge said.
Addressing a press conference held at the GMOA Head Quarters in Colombo yesterday evening, he said a protest march will take place on the 15th of this month and the joint strike will be launched if a solution not given by that time.
According to Dr. Aluthge, a letter has been set to the President by registered post making a formal request from him to conduct an immediate investigation on the conduct of Sanjaya Rajaratna attached to the Attorney General’s Department who is trying his best to sabotage all the efforts made to solve the SAITM issue.
Six hundred days have passed since the medical students started a fast and over 7,000 medical students missed lectures for eight months by now. Doctors who passed out from SLMC approved foreign medical faculties are waiting to sit for the Act 16 Examination. SAITM students are trapped inside SAITM for eight years.
