Inaugural Grade 13  educational programme

The inaugural educational programme for Grade 13 was held at Meegoda Maha Vidyalaya recently. The event was held for students who have passed as well as failed the G C E Ordinary Levels.
Speaking at the event the school’s principal N N Abeysekara said that the programme acts as a guiding light for students who have not passed their G C E Ordinary Levels.
“They have been oppressed by the society and engage in various immoral deeds to earn their bread and butter. This programme gives hope to them for a better future by paving the path to a better living. If this kind of programme had been introduced earlier it would have created as better future for such students,” she said.
For the first time in history a band followed by students from various schools in the region and then the invitees entered the premises to be welcomed by the students of the school. Homagama Provincial Director Palitha Deshapriya Weerasooriya, Homagama Provincial Educational Orgainising Director C Hettiarachchi, many distinguished invitees and principals and vice principals from the schools in the district took part.
