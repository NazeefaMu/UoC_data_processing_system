Barcelona break Real Madrid's record calendar year goals

 
Spanish champions Barcelona have broken rival Real Madrid's record for most goals scored in a calendar year on Wednesday after blanking Real Betis 4-0 at Camp Nou.
As expected the match belonged to Luis Enrique's side, and by the half-hour mark, Barca benefited from a missed Neymar spot kick, which resulted in an own goal from Betis defender Heiko Westermann.
Four minutes later, Lionel Messi doubled the lead to help Barca level Real Madrid on 178 goals in a year, which the Santiago Bernabue side had achieved in 2014.
Two second-half goals from Luis Suarez killed off the competition and also improved Barca's count in 2015 to 180. Of these, Messi, Neymar and Suarez have contributed 48, 41 and 48 respectively.
The match was also Messi's 500th appearance for Barcelona.
With the win, Barcelona have climbed back to the top of in La Liga table with 38 points. Atletico Madrid are in second place with same points, but have played an extra game. Real are in third place with 36 points.
