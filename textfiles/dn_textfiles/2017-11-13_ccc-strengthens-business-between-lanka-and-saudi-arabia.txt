CCC strengthens business between Lanka and Saudi Arabia

A 15 member business delegation organised by the Ceylon Chamber of Commerce (CCC) visited Riyadh to further promote trade, investment and tourism between Sri Lanka and the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia from October 28 to November 1, 2017.
This successful business promotion mission was organised by the Ceylon Chamber of Commerce in collaboration with the Embassy of Sri Lanka in Saudi Arabia.
The delegation participated at number of business discussions followed by B2B meetings arranged by the Commercial Section of the Embassy of Sri Lanka in Riyadh in association with the Saudi Arabia Basic Industries (SABIC), Council of Saudi Chambers (CSC), Saudi Fund for Development (SFD)/Saudi Export Programme (SEP), Riyadh Chamber of Commerce, ALFANAR Company (manufacturer of electrical items), Othaim Hyper Market, Lulu Group International and the National Industrialization Company (Tasnee) - Saudi Arabia’s second largest industrial company and one of the world’s largest producers of chemicals especially Titanium Dioxide.
In addition, a networking event was organised for delegates to meet Sri Lankan expatriate professionals attached to Trade and Investment Steering Committees of the Embassy of Sri Lanka in Saudi Arabia to share their experience in doing business in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. Under the leadership of Azmi Thassim, Ambassador for Sri Lanka in Saudi Arabia, Steering Committees have been formed to promote trade, investment and tourism between our two countries.
“Sri Lanka looks forward to further strengthening ties with the Kingdom, especially in the fields of trade, investment, employment and tourism. Since the establishment of diplomatic relations between the two countries, trade and tourism have tremendously increased for the benefit of the people of the two friendly countries,” said by the Ambassador for Sri Lanka Azmi Thassim at the discussion forums adding that nearly 40,000 Saudi nationals visited Sri Lanka last year. The Ambassador said that Saudi families who had visited Sri Lanka had always opted to repeat their visits because of the island’s natural scenic beauty and the hospitality of its people.
During the discussion forums, Senior Assistant Secretary General of the Ceylon Chamber of Commerce, Lilakshi de Mel extended invitations to the Council of Saudi Chambers and the Riyadh Chamber of Commerce to organise business promotion missions to Sri Lanka to explore many business and investment opportunities available. It was further stated that the visit will go down in the history book of the Chamber as this is the first formal business promotion mission organised to the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia by the Ceylon Chamber of Commerce.
