Death in Police custody; five Policemen seek bail in HC

Five policemen including a Sub Inspector attached to the Peliyagoda Police station arrested and remanded in connection with the death of a suspect while he was in Police custody has sought bail from the Colombo High Court.When the bail application came up before High Court judge A.A.R. Heiyanthuduwa, the petition was fixed for objections on August 8.
On several occasions, the Colombo Chief Magistrate’s Court had refused to grant bail on the suspect citing that the Magistrate does not have jurisdiction to release a person accused of committing a murder.
The 41-year-old deceased, a resident of Biyagama who was arrested in connection with an alleged vehicle robbery, was reported dead on February 25.
