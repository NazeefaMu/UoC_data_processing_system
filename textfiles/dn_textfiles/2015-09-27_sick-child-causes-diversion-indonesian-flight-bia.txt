Sick child causes diversion of Indonesian flight to BIA

An Indonesian passenger flight travelling from Jakarta to Jeddah was diverted to the Bandaranaike International Airport (BIA) last afternoon after a child was injured inside the plane.
The Duty Manager at the airport said the child had got injured while playing inside the plane. He had received minor head injuries and was treated at a private hospital in Negombo.
The flight left the BIA on its scheduled journey after a couple of hours.
