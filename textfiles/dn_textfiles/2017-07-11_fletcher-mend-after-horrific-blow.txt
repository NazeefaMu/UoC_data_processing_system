Fletcher on mend after horrific blow

EDGBASTON, Sunday - Nottinghamshire seam bowler Luke Fletcher was struck on the head in a horrific incident at Edgbaston, with the NatWest T20 Blast match against Warwickshire suspended for half-an-hour while he received treatment.
The fast-bowler was taken to hospital in an ambulance after he suffered the injury in the fourth over of Birmingham’s reply to Nottinghamshire’s 158 for six. Play eventually resumed with Warwickshire stealing a six-wicket victory with a single on the final ball when Notts missed a run-out chance - although concern over Fletcher oversahadowed the chase.
