Gee Neth Sathsara Windanaya with Vision

 
Based in the Hill Capital, Vision is a musical group that consists of talented musicians with inborn talents. The salient feature of this group is that al the musicians are visually impaired. One of them is a soldier who sacrificed his sight during the war against terrorism.
The band leader Prasanna Wickramasinghe and the rest of the members carry on with their livelihood with the least they have without being a burden to the society, thus making them an exemplary group.
With a view to strengthen their financial future to enable them to carry on with their welfare activities, a musical show titled Gee Neth Sathsara Windanaya has been organised to be held on July 9 at Dharmaraja College Auditorium, Kandy.
Special guests artistes Desmond de Silva, Annesley Malawana and Shashika Nisansala will get together with the band for the Vision concert.
The band invites all music lovers from the Hill Capital to be there for the show and make a valuable contribution towards this worthy cause.
