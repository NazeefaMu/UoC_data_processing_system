Venezuela: The other side

Global media is full of stories about massive demonstrations, violence and mass protests against the government of President Maduro, whose fall they predict as imminent. An orchestrated campaign of vilification of the Bolivarian revolution and suppression of factual developments has been continuing ever since Maduro was elected as President. International media has, however, kept silent about arson attacks on government offices, hospitals and members of the security forces by supporters of the Opposition.
The Opposition has staged a Parliamentary coup. It has passed several unconstitutional laws including an amnesty law to grant impunity to those accused of violent crimes and a housing privatization law. The Supreme Court has over-ruled these laws and has suspended the National Assembly. Arsonists have set fire to buildings of the Supreme Court. Nor has the Opposition heeded the call of President Maduro for dialogue. Mediation efforts by Pope Francis have also been rejected by the Opposition.
On July 20 and 21 the Opposition staged a “massive strike”. However, a significant feature of the strike was the non-participation of the workers, who were locked out by employers to make their strike a “success”. Most participants of the strike included shopping mall and commerce employees, private transport providers. Workers repulsed crowds that came to attack and set fire to the Venezuelan TV. The Opposition plans to block election centres today (29) and march to Miraflores Presidential Palace on Sunday the 30th.
Today Venezuela is a deeply polarized society with the upper classes and middle class on one pole and the poor, comprising workers, peasants and indigenous people on the opposite pole. As it is Venezuela is heading towards civil war unless a peaceful solution is found.
Government of President Maduro has been working within the Constitution and has called for elections to a National Constituent Assembly as a means of giving an opportunity for the people to charter the course of future development. The election is fixed for tomorrow (30th).
United States is interfering in developments in Venezuela and has threatened to use all options to effect regime change. This week it threatened to apply “strong and swift” economic sanctions against Venezuela. Already several eminent persons have been sanctioned. Trade alliance Mercosur has expelled Nicaragua from its membership.
By overthrowing the Bolivarian regime the United States hopes to halt or reverse the leftward trend in Latin American politics. Hence the outcome of the power struggle in Venezuela has more than a national significance.
Confrontation mounts in Jerusalem
Pursuing further its aggressive policy of illegally making undivided Jerusalem its capital Israel has introduced new security measures at one of Muslim’s holiest sites –Al-Aqsa mosque restraining Muslim devotees visiting it.
This follows an earlier incident in which two Israeli security guards were killed at the entrance to the mosque.
Palestinians are staging protests at the Mosque against the new move and confrontation is mounting. United Nations Secretary General Antonio Gutierrez has called upon Israel to demonstrate restraint. Turkish President Erdogan has said that by this move Israel is “undermining its Islamic character” and it constraints on Muslims visiting the mosque cannot be accepted. Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia has also criticized the move. Palestine Authority has suspended security cooperation with Israel in protest.
The mosque is situated in East Jerusalem which is considered the capital of a future independent Palestine state. Meanwhile the Knesset (Israeli Parliament) passed the first of three votes (67:41) to approve what it termed “Jerusalem’s Basic Law” to define anew the status of Jerusalem in violation of international agreements. According to this new law, 80 percent of MPs in the Knesset should vote for any sale of land in Jerusalem to a “foreign party”. It is a pre-emptive move to prevent East Jerusalem being the capital of a future Palestine state.
US Senate rejects again Trump's health law
Last Wednesday United States Senate once again defeated by a majority of 10 votes a plan to repeal and replace the Obamacare with a Republican plan. Senators opposed it on the grounds that it is only a plan and no replacement Act was presented. According to the plan it would have taken a two year delay in replacement. Eight ruling Republican Party Senators also voted against the plan.
The day before Senate also rejected the Better Care Reconciliation Act (BRACA) with the support of nine Republican Senators. It included deep cuts in Medicaid – a health program for the poor and disabled persons. Approximately 22 million people gained health insurance under President Obama’s Affordable Care Act.
