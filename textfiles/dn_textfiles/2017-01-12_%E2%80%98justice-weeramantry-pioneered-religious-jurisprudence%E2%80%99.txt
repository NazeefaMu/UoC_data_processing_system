‘Justice Weeramantry pioneered  in religious jurisprudence’

Sri Lanka's most acclaimed Justice C. G. Weeramantry was one of the very few persons among Sri Lankans who were well versed in all the religions and its laws, Moors Islamic Cultural Home President and former Colombo Mayor Omar Kamil said.
Issuing a message, he said Justice Weeramantry was one of those personalities who successfully interpreted the teachings of all major religions, Christianity, Hinduism, Buddhism and Islam in his deliberations as a Judge of the International Court of Justice and was considered as the pioneer in bringing religious jurisprudence in the International Court of Justice.
"The Muslim community all around the world owes him a great deal for his contribution of the book, “Islamic Jurisprudence – An International Perspective” where he was able to wipe out many of the misunderstanding of the Sharia laws due to lack of information for centuries.
"The Moors’ Islamic Cultural Home has had the privilege of hosting him many a times before distinguished gatherings. His erudite and well illustrated speech on “Some Aspects of Islamic Law” on June 2, 1985, brought about an instant change of the misunderstandings others had on Islamic Law.
"We were also given the honour to publish his speech in 1986 with the permission of Justice Weeramantry titled “International Human Rights – Some Islamic Perspectives”.
