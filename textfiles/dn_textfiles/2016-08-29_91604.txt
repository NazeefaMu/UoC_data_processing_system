Directors Confirm Captain America Isn’t Captain America Anymore

He’s not the Captain now.
The ending of “Captain America: Civil War” left a lot more broken than just Iron Man’s suit. (I’m talking about hearts, people.) The film left us with the Avengers splitting up and the Captain putting down his shield.
And now we’re all left wondering, “Whaaaaattt?” What does this mean for Cap’s future? Is he even Captain America anymore?
We had to know the truth.
In honor of “Captain America: Civil War” coming to Digital and DVD, The Huffington Post spoke with the movie’s directors, Joe and Anthony Russo. And the brothers confirmed that Cap is no longer Cap.
“I think him dropping that shield is him letting go of that identity,” said Joe. “It’s him admitting that certainly the identity of Captain America was in conflict with the very personal choice that he was making.”
We know Cap will be back in the “Avengers: Infinity War” movies. Writers Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely previously told HuffPost that part of the reason Cap wasn’t killed in “Civil War” is because the Avengers need him. “There’s a big purple guy coming. He could be very helpful,” said Markus.
That “big purple guy” is Thanos, and he’s set to wreak havoc in the new “Avengers” films. Even though we’ll probably see Cap joining the Avengers to take the baddie down, it seems likely that he’ll be going by a different name.
If that does happen, one possibility is that Cap takes on the moniker Nomad. This actually happens at one point in the Marvel comics when Cap loses faith in the government.
Besides clearing up things about the Cap, the Russo brothers also answered some other “Civil War” mysteries to the best of their abilities ? without giving too much away.
Here are the answers to your unanswered “Civil War” questions:
Q: Did Iron Man make Spider-Man sign the Sokovia Accords?
Joe: How do I say this? I don’t want to give anything away. I’m going to have to plead the fifth on this one because it could actually give stuff away. Anthony: In the parameters of this film?
Joe: In the parameters of this flim, who knows? That was a long jet ride to Germany.
Q: Is Spider-Man’s Uncle Ben in this universe?
Joe: That’s something that people will have to wait for until the “Spider-Man” movie.
Was that the Bluth stair car from “Arrested Development” in the airport scene? Also, what were your other favorite Easter eggs?
Anthony: Certainly, the Bluth stair car is a favorite.
Also, we adore [actor] Jim Rash, and the fact that we were able to cast him in a role that was reminiscent of Dean Pelton [Rash’s character from “Community”] was a thrill for us.
Q: How did Captain America know that the Winter Soldier killed Howard Stark?
Joe: When you watch “The Winter Soldier,” there is a shot of Howard Stark dead behind the wheel of a car, and there is another shot of the Winter Soldier, so there’s certainly an implication that Winter Soldier was involved in Howard Stark’s death. And Captain’s a smart guy. I think he can put two and two together.
Q: One of Bucky’s trigger words is “homecoming.” The new movie is called “Spider-Man: Homecoming.” Is there a connection?
Joe: There’s no connection. It’s completely an accidental connection.
Q: What else don’t we know about that Chris Evans helicopter scene?
Anthony: On the day we were going to shoot that, the costume department got confused and sent Chris to set wearing a jacket. We got to set, and he hadn’t been wearing a jacket up to that point in the sequence, and we were like, “Oh no, no, no. You have to take the jacket off.”
Yup. Good call, gentlemen.
”Captain America: Civil War” arrives on Digital HD, Digital 3D and Disney Movies Anywhere on September 2 and on Blu-ray™ 3D, Blu-ray, DVD and On-Demand on September 13.
