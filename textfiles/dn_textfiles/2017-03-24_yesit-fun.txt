Yes,it is fun...

This year the Drama Society of S. Thomas’ College Mount Lavinia will be 145 years. 145 years of excellence in Drama. 145 year of talent, determination and hard work. 145 years of Drama at the highest standard. English Drama Societies features the Drama Club of this grand and prestigious school.
“We believe that when it comes to our boys, it is their talent that should shine. We guide them but it is really there effort. Everything is really their effort. They work really hard because unlike other schools, these boys are different because they do so much. For them to do drama and other things as well, is a great achievement,” explained Teacher in Charge of Drama, Michelle Herft Goonetilleke.
Goonetilleke pointed out, that when the boys take part in dramas, they do not go to win. That mentality has never been present. They go to do their best and have fun.
“Warden, Director and I, we always state that if you do take part in a play or competition, it is never to win but do your best and enjoy yourself. That is a policy we have. We usually have an annual production. We also take part in Drama competitions. In addition to that when there are events at College we do skits and little things like that. We also conduct workshops. And in addition to that we have the annual Inter-house drama competition,” stated Goonetilleke
Goonetilleke who joined the staff five years ago, feels that since she joined, the standard of Drama has been very consistent. The boys are also fortunate to have an understanding Warden who is very supportive of drama, as he himself has been in the drama society.
“We have had great actors before, but if you look at the students we have even today, there are some very talented actors. In Shakespeare Competitions, one notable fact is that we have won the Best Actress Award as well, because our female roles have been so convincing -Steve de la Zilva in 1973 & Chandri Peiris in 1976.
We also focus mainly on the children in school. We want to inculcate the love for drama, but we also want to encourage youngsters to be a part of this experience. We believe in this more than anything,” added Goonetilleke
All the boys do the production work as well. No outsiders or old boys help out. They handle the sound and lighting and makeup. Everyone has that experience and it is a complete experience that the kids have.
“It is a big commitment, and having said that, when it comes to practices we don’t go heavily into the night. We believe two or three hours of solid practice is enough. That is good because the same boys are involved in so many other things. They have to play in a rugger match or do other kind of sports. Most often practices are in the evenings, because we keep their study times in mind. So we practise from 6 – 9pm. We practise on Saturdays but not Sundays,” said Goonetilleke
Goonetilleke mentioned that it is also the rich heritage of Drama at S.T.C that makes the boys want to do their best.
“One thing I have noticed is that they are very good at taking criticism. And that is something we don’t see very often. They will listen to everyone, take in everything and they will work around it. That is the wonderful quality I have found in our drama society,” stressed Goonetilleke
The society have done all three genres – tragedies, comedies, tragi-comedies including musicals. They are a tight knit group watching plays together. When the opportunity arises they go as a group to watch plays.
“Oedipus was a tragedy. It was a great experience for the senior boys, because it was acted out on the Chapel Steps and it rained on all three days! Christmas Carol was a musical. Romeo and Juliet was a tragi-comedy. We took part in Shakespeare two years ago with Antony and Cleopatra. Also the younger members participate in all kinds of skits. We have an English Literary Day and the Drama Society performs skits on that day as well. The seniors direct the younger boys as well.
When they did the skit ‘Mind Your Language’, for Thomian Pulse, a talent show, organized by the staff club, they actually pulled it off within two weeks. That is the great thing. That is an achievement, because these boys can pull off things in like two weeks!! For this I really respect them. They are able to put together a fantastic show in like two weeks,” added Goonetilleke.
Unique experience
“Drama has a rich tradition at S. Thomas’. It is the oldest society in the school. It is one of the oldest drama societies in Sri Lanka. When it comes to talent, we have a good reputation of producing talented actors. You can name people from the 70’s onwards. People who started their acting in S.T.C and gone on to direct plays once they are older. When it comes to standards we are very high and the quality of dramas follows,” President of the Drama Club, Sebastian Sansoni. Sebastian placed great emphasis on the fact that the Thomian Drama Squad is very versatile.
“I guess what is unique to Thomian Drama is we are adaptable to any challenge or any role. And it is something that we look forward to. We welcome challenges. We can accomplish and do female roles. This versatility comes from the fact that we are very close to each other and we are very committed to what we do. That makes it a comfortable space for us to be what we want to be on stage. It is something I find unique,” stated Sebastian.
The play we did – The Lion, The Witch and the Wardrobe, was a really good experience which included a very big cast, lots of props and new ideas within the play itself which included so many people of different ages, doing various roles.
Sebastian feels that acting in school demands a lot of effort and that every student delivers.
“I really respect them for that. And I think that they want to do their best. They are very pure in terms of their passion towards the society. Whoever joins, comes to love what they are doing and as a result they put in their best effort,” he explained. Vice President Ravishke Tissera commented that the boys have had good results at the Shakespeare interschool competition.
Standards
“In general, people look to Thomian Drama as a standard for good drama in Colombo. That reputation S.T.C has had. S.T.C is well known for the interschool Shakespeare. We have won it more than 15 times and we are very well known at the Shakespeare interschool drama competition.
In 2015 we took part in it, and we won the award for the Best Stage Craft. We have also come runners up twice,” said Tissera.
“I watched a Drama called ‘Cover it Please’ in 2009 which was hilarious, done by our boys. I watched ‘The Lion, The Witch and the Wardrobe’, which was the reason I joined drama. I enjoyed it and it evoked a passion in me. I watched ‘Tragedy of King Oedipus’ as well and that was also good.”
Another Vice President Raynal Wickramaratne commented on the team spirit in the drama club and the unity and brotherhood.
Female characters
“The strength of the Thomian Drama Society comes a lot with the acting itself, because a lot of people acclaim us for the way we act, such as how we do our female characters. In terms of our inter-house drama competitions, we have been up to a very high standard. We have our own thespians writing, directing it and organizing Stage Craft. That is one thing that is up to a very high standard,” said Wickramaratne Committee Member Nilesh Bartlett pointed out that in terms of production they have maintained a very high standard.
“Some of the most memorable productions are Christmas Carol, The Lion, The Witch and the Wardrobe and even last year we did an extract from Mind Your Language, which proved to be very popular. So all of these are fairly memorable.
I think there is a common misconception about drama, that it is perceived to be very easy, and a lot of people can take lightly. But very few people realize what goes on behind the stage, which involves a lot of hard work. The exposure you get in drama at S.T.C, I don’t think a lot of schools can offer it. We have students drawing up budgets, and that type of exposure at a corporate level, such values are inculcated into our students at such an early stage. Yes it is fun but there is a lot of hard work that goes behind,” said Nilesh.
Anoushka Weerakkody, worked backstage during last year’s skit – ‘Mind Your Language’ and felt that the effort put in was tremendous.
“One thing that really helps us to act, which is mostly done by the Director is that we keep out phones aside. It is a set rule that we have to keep our phones on the table before we act so that we can concentrate fully,” said Anoushka. All the boys generally agreed on the work ethic saying that it is a good mixture of fun and hard work. When practice does start there is the simple discipline of not talking too much and focusing on what needs to be done. Of course a joke is cracked here and there to lighten the mood. The boys also agreed that they take their work seriously, to bring out the best that they can for the show.
And the greatest enjoyment they get is when they pull of a successful production, because it is and always will be a collective effort!
