Eggs-actly what we’re craving for!

Located just a ten minute walk from the Museum Of Contemporary Art, downtown Los Angeles’s very own Grand Central Market gives the ambiance of a small European haunt. First opened in 1917, the market ranges from concept gourmet foods to authentic American classics to ethnic cuisines, satisfying any craving.
At the Broadway street entrance lies ‘Eggslut’, a gourmet food concept with a particular love for eggs. ‘Eggslut’ is known for its delicious food, all of which is inspired by eggs. The gourmet concept venture started as a Los Angeles food truck in 2011. However, in early 2014 co-owners Alvin Cailan and Jeff Vales closed their food truck, expanded their menu and opened up a small shop in the Grand Central Market. No longer tailoring just to breakfast fanatics, ‘Eggslut’ serves lunch, (with an egg of course!) from 11:30 until closing, for those who may not want a breakfast sandwich for lunch.
Their menu ranges from simple meals, such as the bacon, egg and cheese, to something a bit more sophisticated for foodies, such as the Gaucho (tri-tip steak, chimichurri, red onions, seasoned arugula and an over-medium egg).
Each sandwich is served on their homemade brioche, which is made fresh and warmed before serving. An especially unique dish that ‘Eggslut’ offers is ‘The Slut’. This is potato purée topped with an egg, seasoned to perfection and boiled in a glass jar in order to poach the egg. The dish is served in the jar with a demi-baguette on the side.
With all of their dishes, ‘Eggslut’ embraces the gourmet food concept by emphasizing the importance of quality and innovation, while also embracing simplicity. Each dish is simple, yet holds a very unique flavor.
The bacon, egg and cheese features house-made chipotle ketchup, while the sausage, egg and cheese is served with a flavour twist of honey mustard aioli. The food also highlights the value of fresh and organic ingredients.
All ingredients are of high quality, and the food is made to order. The menu explains where all the meat is from, informing visitors of their value of quality. Also, conscious of environmental issues, ‘Eggslut’ serves Box Water is Better, a sustainable water company.
