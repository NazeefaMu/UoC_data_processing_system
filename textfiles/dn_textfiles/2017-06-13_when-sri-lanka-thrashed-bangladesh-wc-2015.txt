When Sri Lanka thrashed Bangladesh in WC 2015

Rewinding our reader’s minds, to the above match which the ardent fans might remember.
Sri Lanka won the toss and elected to bat, Dinesh Chandimal got the nod to replace injured Jeevan Mendis. The game was played at the MCG where Sri Lankans are bound to throng there to watch the proceedings and once they enter the arena, they will watch with abated breath.
T.M. Dilshan and L. Thirimanne opened, Sri Lanka’s batting line up which ran deep with Chandimal anchoring the no. 7 slot. Thirimanne was dropped in the first over by Inamul Haque off Mortaza, I for 0 after one over. Hussein bowls a wide to Thirimanne from the other end and follows up with another, and Thirimanne got the first four of the match, a mistimed drive through the covers. It was 11 for 0 after 3 overs. He still found it difficult to find the sweet spot of the bat although scoring in a disjointed fashion, after 6 overs it was 25 with a solitary boundary thus far. At this stage Dilshan was 4 off 7 balls Thirimanne was more in the scenario than Dilshan. It was 28 for 0 after 7 overs. Taskin replaced Hussein and Dilshan thwacks him past cover for 4 and summarily dispatches him to square leg for another and nonchalantly hooks him for yet another, 40 for 0 after 8 overs. Mortaza was bowling on a tight line and tempts Thirimanne to go aerial past mid off for 3 and then snicks him past slips for three, Mortaza was livid and the score stood at 46 for 0 off 9. Shakib al Hassan was introduced to the attack and Dilshan edged him past slip for 3 runs. 51 for 3 after 10 overs and Sri Lanka were comfortably placed, Thirimanne a laborious 29 off 42 balls and Dilshan the more enterprising was 18 off 22 balls. Dilshan pulled Mortaza through mid-wicket for four, due to his open stance and exaggerated bottom hand play his offside shots looked crablike but not so his leg side fluent play. Mahamadullah, the off spinner was introduced to the attack at 60 off 12. Shakib bowls a tight maiden over to Dilshan, and the following over gets a 4 past cover, using his footwork to good effect, 80 for 0 after 17 and 83 for 0 after 18, Bangladesh doing a containing job, after a long drought of fours Dilshan breaks the stale mate and cuts loose; and pulls Mahamadullah for four and straight drives Taskin for another four, and followed by two more, a flurry of fours got him to his fifty, our score stood at 103 for 0 in 21 overs. Thirimanne lifted Sabir over the bowler’s head for four and got to his 50 off 74 balls, a dogged innings indeed, immediately he gets out trying to paddle sweep and gave a catch to Taskin at deep third man off Rubel.
Kumar Sangakkara walked out to a tremendous roar from the crowd, it was his 400th game, 25 overs had gone 122 for 1, and a solid platform was built for a big score. Immediately Sanga showed Thirimanne how to play the paddle sweep over the slips and got a clean four. It was 133 for 1 at a run rate of 5, fours kept rolling on and it was 160 for 1 off 32. Sangakkara artistacaly opened the face of the bat to avoid the cover fielder and got a four off Taskin the exasperated bowler. A caught and bowled chance was dropped off Sanga and the crowd breathed a sigh of relief, he then drove Shakib al Hassan past extra cover for four and the 50 partnership came in 52 balls, runs coming at a fair gallop. Sanga is on song now cover driving Mortaza for four and brought up the 200, he got to his fifty sweeping Shakib for four, 52 off 46 balls, after 40 overs, 217 for 1, Dilshan got to his hundred in 116 balls bringing up the hundred partnership as well. The trade mark Dilscoop was also on display and another boundary. It was batting at its best by the two Sri Lankan maestros, Dilshan’s unorthodoxy vs Sangakkara’s improvisation, our guys were really proud to be Sri Lankans. And the banners and the flags were a blaze. Sri Lanka wraps up at 332 in 50 overs.
Bangladesh went gamely for the target but fell short by 92 runs, Dilshan shone with the ball together with Lasith Malinga to bring home the bacon. Dilshan was the Man of the Match.
SRI LANKA OUTCLASS INDIA
Looking into the current scene Sri Lanka outclassed, out thought and bamboozled India. Although hampered with injuries and penalties, they came with all their guns blazing on the day and it was batting at its calculated best. It was Kusal Mendis the little daredevil from Moratuwa who peppered the mid wicket boundary with his extraordinary hand to eye coordination and the more orthodox Danushka Gunathilake who with his high elbow technique and power packed strokes down the ground and over it that broke the back of the cock a hoop Indian bowlers. The Indian bowlers’ faces for the first time in this tournament looked like dead corpses. Both were unfortunately run outwhen well set, then it was the muscle bound Kusal Perera and somewhat stiff Angelo Mathew’s show, the former found his timing wanting but the latter took command from the word go with his little dinks on either side of the wicket and the angry looking Virat Kohli was at a loss trying to stop the run drip. Gradually Kusal found his rhythm and was muscling the ball to all corners of the park and next to no time the target was within reach of the Lankans when cramps got the better of him. Kusal of course was running like a hare in comparison to Mathews dawdling, which could be excused for his injury prone limbs. Mathews was the master of the match situation at all times and till the end. In the end the great improviser Asela Gunaratne was the catalyst to hasten the victory for the Sri Lankans. A Sri Lankan fan said, “it was high speed hitting”. It was the mother of all upsets on the Champions Trophy thus far.
