Wild  adventure

What happens when two childhood friends share a passion for the wild and photography? Discover the answer this weekend when Amrit Rajaratnam and Shanik De Silva present ‘The Wild,’ an exhibition of photographs on January 21 and 22 from 9am to 6pm at the Lionel Wendt Gallery. The exhibition pays tribute to animals that inhabit the African savannah.
Amrit Rajaratnam, Managing Director of Maitland and Knox, the managing agents of The Galle Fort Hotel, Thotalagala and The Havelock Place Bungalow, traces his love for the wild back to his infancy.
When his father gave him his first camera, his love for photography proved a perfect match for his already ingrained passion for the wild.

Having spent several years overseas while he read law at the University of Nottingham and was called to the Bar from Lincoln's Inn, Amrit returned to Sri Lanka. He was devastated by the changes the relentless march of progress has wrought in the quiet wild places he had known. Seeing similar changes across the globe, he was determined to capture the essence of the last remaining locations and to share them through his photography.
He found the perfect companion with whom to embark on this endeavour - his childhood friend Shanik De Silva. Shanik has always been enthralled by the wild. Having learned most of his photography on a film camera, he moved on to digital cameras about 10 years ago.
Shanik is the Managing Director of Water Mart Systems having graduated with an Honours degree in Industrial Economics from the University of Warwick. However, he says that nothing makes him happier than being in the wilds of this world with like-minded souls.
