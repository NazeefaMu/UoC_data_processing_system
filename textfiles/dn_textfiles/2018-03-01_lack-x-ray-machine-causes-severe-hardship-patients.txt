Lack of x-ray machine causes severe hardship to patients

The x-ray machine at the Mahiyangana Base Hospital has been out of commission for the last two months. This has caused great inconvenience to patients from five health divisions seeking treatment at this hospital.
Sources say that patients needing x-ray reports have to be sent to the Badulla hospital in ambulances causing inconvenience to hospital employees two.
It is said that the hospital has only a small portable x-ray machine which cannot be used for major requirements. However, hospital Director Dr. Kithsiri Samarakoon when contacted said, they have already informed the agents concerned to repair the machine.
The company had informed them that they are awaiting spare parts from the principals in Jaffna for replacement and they hoped to attend to the
repairs without any
further delay.
