UNP  victory  certain - Rosy

Former UNP Parliamentarian Rosy Senanayake who is vying for the Colombo Mayorship yesterday said that the UNP’s victory at the forthcoming Local Government election is a foregone conclusion. She said a stronger team is in the fray for the Colombo Municipal Council(CMC) under her leadership. Senanayake said that the Colombo Municipal Council will be turned into an entity capable of facing any challenges in the modern world under her leadership. “We will turn the CMC into the most efficient public institution by streamlining its services,” she said.Senanayake thanked Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe for providing an opportunity for women to reach the top rung of the political arena by allocating quota for women representation for every Local Government body. She said that this government succeeded in ensuring 25–30 percent womens’ representation in every Local Government body. “The United National Party is committed to uplift the living standards of the people in the Colombo city and novel programmes will be in place aiming at this target under my leadership,” Senanayake said.
