Central Bank bond issue: Parliament to send COPE report to AG

 AG to forward report to IGP :
Both sides welcome Speaker’s proposal:
Parliament yesterday agreed to the Speaker’s proposal to forward the COPE report on Central Bank Treasury bonds investigation to the Attorney General.
Speaker Karu Jayasuriya making a special announcement at the commencement of sittings said the COPE report could be forwarded to the Attorney General if all members of the House agree.
He said eventhough there were hardly any past instances where COPE reports had been forwarded to the AG for further action, doing so would lead to a positive trend. “It is my opinion that forwarding any such Committee reports to the AG even in the future will be a good and healthy practice” the Speaker said.
The Speaker said the report would be forwarded to the IGP by the Attorney General.
Members of both sides spoke in favour of the proposal of the Speaker. Leader of the House and Minister Lakshman Kiriella thanked the Speaker for initiating what he termed a “new tradition in Parliament”. “Over the past 10-20 years many COPE reports were presented but none was referred to the AG. We requested the then Speaker to send them to the AG, but in vain” he said.
The minister also distanced the Government from the petition filed before the Supreme Court challenging the COPE report. “Some said the Government had a sinister motive to disrupt the debate by way of this petition. We had no such motive, and neither had we raised that point in the debate yesterday. We have faith in the parliamentary traditions and its control of public finances” he said.
COPE Chairman and JVP MP Sunil Handunnetti while thanking the Speaker also pointed out the need for allowing Parliament and COPE to review the process. MP Vasudeva Nanayakkara said it would be better if the Speaker forward the report also to the IGP. He also asked to fix a time frame for the Attorney General to report back to the Speaker.
Deputy Minister Ajith P Perera proposed to establish a separate division in the Attorney General’s Department to work hand in hand with the Committees on Public Accounts.
