We are delighted to receive the award which reinforces our commitment to secure our customers with the best technologies and further our partnership with Fortinet.”
Plenary sessions and workshops at the conference centered around Digital Transformation and the need to shift security from a fixed perimeter mindset to one where security is automatically applied wherever data is located. Partners were presented with new business opportunities to bundle specialized security technologies to be dynamically deployed where and when they are needed, and then marshal the distributed power of the entire security infrastructure to respond to detected threats in a consistent and correlated fashion.
