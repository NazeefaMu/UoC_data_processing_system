Working magic!

Even if you have visited Yosemite National Park dozens of times, you’ve probably never seen Yosemite Falls like this.
A video shot on Oct. 30, 2017, shows the famous falls transformed into a cascading rainbow by unusually strong winds.
Photographer Greg Harlow told Cater News Agency that he and a buddy were sipping coffee at Glacier Point while waiting to shoot the classic view at sunrise. Suddenly they glimpsed a flash of red at the falls.
“First it was red, then it worked its way across the spectrum to a full rainbow,” Harlow said. “We were two of only about ten people to witness this. The spot was empty because it was so windy that morning.”
The extremely high winds, rare for Yosemite Valley, buffeted the waterfall, creating clouds of spray just as the sun began to rise. The diffraction of low rays of sunlight hitting water droplets resulted in a undulating rainbow extending the entire length of the 1,450-foot waterfall.
Multi-tiered Yosemite Falls, recharged by rain and snowmelt, and photographed from Sentinel Meadow, is one of several waterfalls that has turned Yosemite Valley into the showpiece of the world.
Small waterfall rainbows are often seen in the mist kicked up by Yosemite’s Vernal Falls, but a rainbow of this magnitude on Yosemite Falls is rare indeed.“We lost it when we saw what was happening. It was beautiful,” Harlow said.
Harlow, who travels year round to shoot images of natural beauty year round, called it “the most jaw dropping moment of my career so far.” SF Gate
