COPE to probe coal tender, rice scam

Investigations to be based on AG’s audit reports:
Two reports handed over to Speaker, COPE:
The Committee on Public Enterprises (COPE) will start investigations into the recent coal tender controversy and the massive scam related to rice importation in 2014/2015, COPE Chairman Sunil Handunnetti said.
Speaking to the Daily News yesterday, he said investigations would be based on the audit reports of the Auditor General. He said the Auditor General on Tuesday handed over two reports pertaining to the above matters to the Speaker as well as the COPE.
Handunnetti said the copies of the audit reports would be distributed among all COPE members during its meeting scheduled on Monday. “We have to give time for the members to study the contents of the reports.
In our next meeting we will fix a date to take up these reports for consideration,” he said.
Meanwhile, Campaign for Free and Fair Elections (CaFFE) Executive Director Keerthi Tennakoon issuing a press release yesterday said the Auditor General in his report had stated that the controversial coal procurement tender had resulted in a loss of Rs 4,145 million to the Government.
The CaFFE had written to President Maithripala Sirisena yesterday and on January 2 urging his intervention to terminate the controversial tender to supply coal to the Lakvijaya Power Plant.
The Audit report in its conclusions had questioned the conduct of the Lanka Coal Company over the past years and had called on the authorities to study whether it is necessary to continue with it.
The other Audit report is related to importing large stocks of rice in 2014 without Cabinet approval or following the tender procedure.
Handunnetti revealing full details of the rice importation scam in Parliament on December 2 said a staggering amount of Rs 18,597 million had been spent on importing these rice stocks when there was no shortage of rice in the country.
Handunnetti said the loss the Government had incurred by selling these imported rice stocks at cheaper rates amounts to Rs 2,359 million. These stocks which were stored in warehouses for a long period were declared as animal fodder after those were found to be unsuitable for human consumption.
