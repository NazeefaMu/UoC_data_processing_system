No night shifts for nurses for one year after child birth

The Health Ministry has stopped night shifts for nurses for a period of one year from the date of delivery of their child, Health Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne had stated.
According to Minister Dr. Senaratne, nurses will be assigned for night shifts only after one year from the date of child birth.
This will enable them to look after their infants properly. The minister announced this after laying the foundation stone for an eight storey new nurses’ training school building to be constructed at Kalutara.
Minister Dr. Senaratne pointed out that nurses’ training schools will be set up in Anuradhapura, Kalutara, Kandy and Galle.
The National Institute of Health Sciences at Kalutara will be strengthened. Human resources in the health sector will be developed in next four years, he said. Over time payments for nurses and other health professionals have been increased with effect from January 1, 2016, he added.
