Indian Coast Guard Ship Shoor on goodwill visit

The Indian Coast Guard Ship Shoor, which helped the Sri Lankan Navy douse a fire onboard the container carrier MSC Daniela in April 2016, made its first goodwill visit for the year on Friday (30).
This is the first Indian as well as Coast Guard ship to visit Sri Lanka this year. The visit provided training opportunities for 40 members of the Sri Lankan Coast Guard onboard Shoor.
Shoor is a 105 metre Offshore Patrol Vessel commissioned on April 11, 2016. It is Indian built and is fitted with advanced navigation and communication equipment, sensors and machinery.
The features include 30 mm CRN 91 Naval Gun, Integrated Bridge System (IBS), Integrated Machinery Control System (IMCS), Power Management System (PMS) and High Power External Fire Fighting System. The ship is designed to carry one twin-engine, Light Helicopter and five high-speed boats including two QRIBs (Quick Response Boats) for fast boarding operations, search and rescue, law enforcement and maritime patrol. The ship is also capable of carrying pollution response equipment to combat oil spill contamination at sea.
“When we were here last year, we were called to douse the fire on a container ship. We fought it day and night, for four days straight as it is difficult to douse a fire on a ship. It just spreads like matchboxes on fire,” said Ship Captain B. Murugan, speaking to a group of Sri Lankan journalists taken on a tour of the ship yesterday.
In March this year, Shoor was also called on to douse a fire onboard Singapore flag Merchant Vessel (MV) Maersk Honman - a vessel three times the size of the OPV, 650 miles off Kochi, India.
The Captain said the ship which is capable of pumping 1,000 tons of water per hour to douse a fire, was successful in putting out the metallic fire and managed to save the ship.
The Indian Coast Guards’ rapid response to firefighting had thus helped it win favour and diplomacy with neighbours in the region and in the future, has the potential to play an important role in increasing maritime cooperation between the two nations, as the role of Coast Guards expand beyond immediate shores to meet threats such as illegal fishing and maritime crime.
Shoor will leave Lankan shores today (3).
