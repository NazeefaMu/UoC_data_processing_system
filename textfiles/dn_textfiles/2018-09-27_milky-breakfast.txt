Milky Breakfast

Serving healthy meals for children, especially picky eaters, is a main concern for parents. Most of the children love milk, so you already have one delicious food on the table.
Creating healthy meals for little ones can be simple and stress-free when you have a plan. Start by incorporating options from a variety of food groups. When planning meals and your child’s snacks, focus on offering a variety of fruits and vegetables, adding whole grains, different lean protein choices as well as milk and milk products to deliver vitamins and minerals growing bodies need.
Protein is an integral part of every nutritious meal, including breakfast. A protein-rich breakfast, including milk, helps to start your child’s day right. In fact, studies show eating breakfast helps your child concentrate and focus at school. From muscles to hair, bones to teeth, the body needs protein to be healthy and strong.
Protein impacts many different functions, including:
Building lean muscle – Protein supplies your body with the amino acids it needs to build strong muscles. Getting enough protein in your diet, along with exercise, helps build and repair muscle.
Keeping you fuller, longer – Getting enough protein, more than carbohydrates or fats, can help you feel full, and satisfied with your meal which means you may not feel hungry again mid-morning.
Maintaining bone health – Along with key bone-building nutrients like calcium and vitamin D, protein also helps build healthy bones. Milk is a great protein food for kids
With nine essential nutrients, including protein, in each eight-ounce glass, milk is a delicious, simple and wholesome option. Consuming milk and milk products is especially important during childhood and adolescence, when bone mass is being built.
All dairy milk — whether it is fat free, flavoured or organic milk provides essential nutrients. In addition to naturally occurring, high-quality protein, milk contains other nutrients including B vitamins for energy, vitamin A to help maintain a healthy immune system as well as calcium and vitamin D, both that work in concert for bone health.
It is the daily recommendation that toddlers ages 2-3 get two glasses of milk, children age 4-8 get 2.5 cups and 3 cups for adolescents, teens and adults. So just remember, beginning proper milk drinking habits as a child can have lifelong benefits. Milk in the morning is a healthy habit that helps provide kids with nutrients they need for the day and benefits that extend well beyond the morning.
