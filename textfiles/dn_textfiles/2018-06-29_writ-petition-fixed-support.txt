Maharagama Urban Council:
Writ petition fixed for support

A writ petition filed seeking a declaration that the election of 23 candidates who contested the Maharagama Urban Council under an independent group (motorcycle symbol) is invalid and that they are disqualified from sitting and voting was yesterday fixed for support by the Court of Appeal.
When the petition came up before Court of Appeal (President) Preethi Padman Surasena and Justice Arjuna Obeysekara, the matter was fixed for support on July 26.
Chandrasena Perera, a registered voter for the electoral area of the Maharagama Urban Council, has filed this petition naming 27 persons including 23 members of the independent group, Election Commission Chairman Mahinda Deshapriya and members of Election Commission as respondents.
The petitioner stated that the elections of the members of Independent Group No. 2 are void since they did not have the qualification required by Section 08 of the Local Authorities Elections Ordinance.
The petitioner alleged that most of candidates who contested under the motorcycle symbol were not residents of Maharagama. The petitioner said the addresses listed next to their names read as Divulapitiya, Badalgama and Wellawatte.
The petitioner is also seeking an interim order directing the Election Commission to produce the official nomination paper and the respective affidavits and declarations of the candidates of Independent Group No.2 who contested the Local Authorities Elections held on February 10.
President’s Counsel Faiz Musthapha and counsel Amarasiri Panditharatne appeared for the petitioner.
