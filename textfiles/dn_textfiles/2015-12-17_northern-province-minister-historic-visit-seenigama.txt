Northern Province Minister in historic visit to Seenigama

The Foundation of Goodness hosted a historic visit by Northern Province Minister of Education Cultural Affairs and Sports Thambyrajah Gurukularajah at the Foundation of Goodness MCC Centre of Excellence in Seenigama last Saturday.
Minister Gurukularajah participated in a special North/ South exchange of school supplies packs as part of the FoG Essential School Supplies Programme for the 2016 school year as well as visiting FoG's 30 empowerment sectors in action, including the Seenigama Sports Academy.
To mark the occasion of this visit, the Foundation of Goodness facilitated the exchange of school bags for the Southern and North/Eastern communities, with a cheque for 300 school packs being presented to the Foundation of Goodness by the Oru Paanai Trust under the guidance of the Sri Lankan High Commissioner to Australia Somasundaram Skandakumar to benefit children in the South whilst in return, the Foundation of Goodness presented a cheque for 633 school packs to be distributed in to the North, East and Estate Community school children.
The distribution of these school packs are part of the Foundation of Goodness's Essential School Supplies Programme (ESSP) which has now been active for over 15 years, during which time they have delivered 25,000 school supplies packs to children all across the island.
The Foundation of Goodness (FoG) was established in 1999 to bridge the gap between the rural and urban populations.
