Making hay while the sun shines – sad tale of SLC

So the much hyped about Lankan Premier League (LPL) will not take place as scheduled in mid-August this year.
The news that it will not be held did not come officially from Sri Lanka Cricket (SLC) but from former Sri Lanka cricketer turned international commentator Russel Arnold who was the director for the tournament who tweeted: “Hi Folks !!! The Lankan Premier League which was to be played in Aug/Sep has been postponed.”
From the outset it was clear that Sri Lanka does not need that kind of tournament because we don’t have the market like India (Indian Premier League) or Australia (Big Bash League) to sustain a showpiece T20 of that magnitude.
It was not commercial concerns that forced the postponement on this occasion but the absence of an elected or appointed body to administer cricket. This is the third time out of four attempts a T20 showpiece has been cancelled by SLC.
The current state of affairs of the country’s cricket administration which is being run by a Competent Authority appointed by the Minister of Sports is in no position to undertake such a task and Arnold has found little or no support coming his way to go ahead with the tournament.
It is no surprise that Sri Lanka cricket finds itself in such a mess today with a court injunction holding up proceedings and preventing an AGM from taking place. Even if the AGM was held as scheduled on May 31 what purpose would it have served?
The same faces that had administered cricket for the past two years and brought cricket down to its knees through mismanagement would have got re-elected and continued from where they left off.
The whole crux of the matter is that there is no law in this country to punish the people who rob the SLC of its finances. The individuals get elected or appointed (as in the case of interim committees) and during their term in office make the most of the finances that SLC has and they are sent out without being questioned or brought to book as there is no law in place to punish them.
A good clear example was during the Cricket World Cup in 2011 when the interim committee headed by DS de Silva utilized SLC funds to build a cricket stadium in Hambantota and to upgrade two other stadiums in Colombo and Pallekele that eventually left SLC in the red with overdrawn bank accounts and with no money left to pay its employees or the contracted players.
For the past 15-20 years or so this has been the trend with elected and certain appointed administrations whose sole purpose of getting elected to the portals of SLC is to make money. Such incidents do not get highlighted so much in the media when the national cricket team is performing well. At the moment it is not doing so well in all three formats.
The signing of television rights and calling for tenders are two areas where the SLC is cleaned up of all its hard earned profits that come from the sweat and toil of our cricketers. There are millions and billions of dollars exchanged when TV rights are signed and when tenders are called for during tours for hotels, transport, meals etc.
It is not only the elected cricket officials who benefit but even the Sports Ministers whose interference in SLC affairs must stop. There have been several instances of Sports Ministers making a fast buck on TV deals in the past and the carnival goes on. Also there should not be interference with cricket selections or the appointment of selectors by the Sports Minister. That area has to be entrusted to the SLC to appoint their own selection committee who in turn picks the teams.
Another sad plight that has come to light is the attitude of the officials and employees at SLC. When they sit down at their desk in the mornings the first thing they think of is how they can make their next fast buck.
If all financial matters of SLC are handled by a treasury appointed official this abuse of finances will not take place and tenders will not be passed at the blink of an eyelid as it is done today.
A question that is often asked by many cricket followers is: Was head coach Chandika Hathurusingha’s predecessor Graham Ford given the same freedom by SLC that Hathu enjoys today?
Ford was doing all right until SLC brought former cricketer Asanka Gurusinha from Down Under and made him cricket manager of the team and then a national selector. It was after that, that things began to get awry and Ford decided to quit ahead of time.
The present court injunction that is pending is for misappropriation of funds by the Sumathipala administration. It is no secret that a lot of money is spent to buy votes ahead of elections and the present constitution does not give another candidate a ghost of a chance of winning the election. What is required is through Parliament to change the constitution of the SLC by the Sports Law which supersedes everything else. Only the Sports Minister can do it and that can happen only if he has Sri Lanka cricket at heart.
