‘Yowun Puraya’, reflection of peace under new govt: Sampanthan

‘Yowun Puraya 2017’ reflects the changes Sri Lanka has undergone under the new government in favour of peace and prosperity, Opposition Leader R. Sampanthan said on Saturday.
“These opportunities we must not miss to entrench peace, harmony and economic development,” Sampanthan noted speaking in the presence of both the President and the Prime Minister at the closing ceremony of the ‘Yowun Puraya 2017’ in Trincomalee.He requested President Maithripala Sirisena and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe to continue being committed to a peaceful Sri Lanka.
Sampanthan said the previous Rajapaksa regime was one of dictatorship and it is the responsibility of all parties to secure democracy that has been re-established by the Yahapalana government. He also said we should not miss the opportunity Sri Lanka is bestowed upon.
The Opposition Leader pointed out that the previous regime did not seek answers for the hardships faced by Tamil community in a post war era. They thought that the end of a physical war means really the end of a long-term conflict, which is not, he said.
It was in the backdrop where the previous Rajapaksa regime thought the Tamil community are slaves, that the welcomed regime change came about, Sampanthan said.
All parties should assist the coalition government that is on its way to a new destination, he added.
Sampanthan pointed out Sri Lankans face a number of issues such as economical challenges, foreign debt, lack of law and order where as the Tamil community has more issues such as land ownership issues and political prisoners.
Thus, a long term peace process including a solid reconciliation program should enable ethnicities to call Sri Lanka sincerely their motherland.
