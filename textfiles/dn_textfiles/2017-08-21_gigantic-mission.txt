A gigantic mission!

Fresh air scented with wild flowers, evenings around a camp fire and a night sky full of stars; for many camping is the ultimate getaway from busy lives in the city but for a guide camping is more than a getaway. It opens the door to empower themselves to make their own choices in decision making at all levels making them endure the challenges and emerging as a future leader.
Camping adds flavour to the life of a guide making them one with nature. The Sri Lanka Girl Guides Association will hold their centenary Girl Guide Camp `Jumbo ‘17- Eco Safari Sri Lanka’ from August 23 to 27at the Sri Lanka Army Infantry Training Centre in Minneriya. Approximately 1,200 girl guides will participate at the camp together with 200 leaders and senior guides.
This event is being organised in line with the centenary celebrations SGGA had earlier this year including the centenary grand awards ceremony which was held in February at the BMICH and the huge rally with the participation of 6,000 girl guides at Bogambara grounds.

“The camp will bring out the values of guides. Camping is crucial for guides as they have to get involved in outdoor activities. Girl guides are focusing more on the 12 to 17 years age group at this camp. Girls who had at least camped once were chosen to participate. Participants will include schools island-wide not only the famous schools in each province. Eco Safari 2017is an ecologically sensitive event which will give a brand new experience to the girl guides,” Deputy Chief Commissioner, SGGA, Visakha Tillekeratne said.
“The guides will visit an eco-village where they will engage in rice and paddy cultivation, learn about organic fruits and vegetables. Children should be aware of agriculture in the country to reduce the carbon food print. They will also taste various food and juices made from fruits and vegetables that are grown in the dry zone such as kekiri and lime juice, tamarind and water melon juice and many more,” Tillekeratne added.
Jumbo issues
The elephant is the symbol of this year’s camp and is also the symbol of SLGGA. “There are so many issues with elephants in our country. We should be aware of the importance of this gentle animal. The participants will have quizzes on elephants and there will be a key note speaker, 23 year old Tharindu Muthukumarana who recently launched his book on life of elephants. It will give the guides the knowledge of the elephant which is now an endangered species. Children cannot take part in conservation if they do not connect with the environment. The camp will give them the opportunity to observe the nature at the National park which is full of biodiversity and wildlife particularly birds, the leopard and elephants,” Tillekeratne said.
She added that there will be an adventure trek which will include `Adventure in Lend a Hand’, `Sporting Adventures’ `Aesthetic Adventures’ and camp excursions. “Girls will get the opportunity to try something new and exciting. There will be workshops on pottery, jewellery designing and crafts. The girls will enjoy camp fires as well. The camp will be a platform for exchanging friendship and thus promoting harmony among all communities. There will be around 42 guides from North and Eastern provinces. The camps will be divided into three sub camps - Kandula, Raja and Kadol representing elephants that were historically important in our country,” Tillekeratne added.
Values
“Girl Guides from Colombo will travel by train. For some girls it is their first time in the train. It will enrich their lives and add new experience. Camping opens up the avenues to go back to the fundamentals in life. Being a girl guide give one the advantage of breaking free from the routine life children spend going back and forth from school and tuition classes. The camp will enable girls to rise to challenges they face in everyday life, increase their environmental awareness, promote healthy living and give them the independence to explore life while involving in team work. Girls will be able to maximize their talents and we will inculcate Girl Guide values in the participants so that they can take the message to outer community,” she said.
“Sri Lanka Girl Guides Association, a member of the World Association of Girl Guides and Girls Scouts was introduced to Sri Lanka in 1917 by Methodist Missionaries. Since then the movement has been reaching out to girls from various paths of life to develop their full potential as responsible citizens of their country. Director of the Executive Committee, Sri Girl Guides Association, Vajira Silva is dedicated in making this camp a success,” Tillekeratne added.
She also commended Sri Lanka Army for the generous support they extend in providing logistics for the campers. “Sri Lanka Army was delighted to extend their assistance in this event.
The image of the Army which was tarnished during the times of conflict will be restored in collaborating in such events. They have built new water tanks and toilets especially for the camp. Around fifty female army officers will provide security and meals will be provided free of charge. We thank Sri Lanka Army for their unfailing support rendered towards making the camp a reality,” Tillekeratne said.
