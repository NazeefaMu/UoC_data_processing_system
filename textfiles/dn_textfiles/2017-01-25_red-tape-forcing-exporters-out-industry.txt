Red tape forcing exporters out of industry

Free Trade Agreements (FTAs) and targets to increase exports may come to naught as a recent study conducted by Verite Research which shows that administrative procedures and bureaucratic red tape were forcing exporters to leave the industry all together.
“The government has set a 30 billion target for exports in the 2017 Budget, but the question is how are we going to meet it?” questioned 2nd Vice Chairman of the Lanka Fruit and Vegetable Producers, Processors and Exporters Association, Suresh Ellawala.
He pointed out that the members of his own association had faced grave issues within our own domestic borders when exporting perishable items.
According to Doing Business Index 2017 of the World Bank, it takes 76 hours on an average to comply with the export documentary requirements in Sri Lanka, compared to just 11 hours in Thailand.
Given these persistent issues, the Exporters Association had requested that think tank Verite Research conduct a study on the issue and arrive at a solution to the problem.
“Agriculture which accounts for 10 percent of GDP, employs 30 percent of the population and makes up 23 percent of the total exports in the country. Over the years however, we have come to dependent on certain exports lacking diversification, but our potential to do so had been limited by barriers within our own shores,” explained Head of Economics at Verite Research Subhashini Abeysinghe, as she presented their findings last week.
At present, 13 percent of our agricultural exports are in spices, 20 percent in coconuts, 50 percent go to tea and all other exports make up 17 percent.
“There is potential in increasing the share of this 17 percent,” Abeysinghe said.
However, even if many exporters wished to increase or diversify their exports, Verite Research’s analysis showed that bureaucratic red tape, taxes, policy or the lack of it, infrastructure, regulations, lack of access to information, bribery and corruption, imposed major barriers to the desire for expansion.
“Importers also complain that it was difficult to get quality products throughout the year from Sri Lanka,” Abeysinghe said.
Barriers to trade
Abeysinghe added that these barriers to trade meant that Sri Lanka at 103 in the Enabling Trade Index, had dropped down to 19th place in the last two years.

As Executive Director of Verite Research, Nishan De Mel explained that falling behind in the index may not necessarily be because the government in the last two years did unusually badly, but because other exporting countries had managed to fare much better.
“The rest have moved forward, while we haven’t moved at all,” he said, explaining that countries such as Bangladesh, had introduced online systems such as the ‘Bangladesh Trade Portal,’ which provided all the information an exporter would need in one place. The portal was also regularly updated to keep track with any new policy or regulation changes.
In Sri Lanka in the meantime, information was often hard to find, costly or unreliable.
“The Fish exporters website have some information, but it had not been updated since 2009,” De Mel pointed out adding, “Often exporters have complained that they travel to the airport to find that the rules have changed.”
An analysis of the seven government agencies: National Plant Quarantine Service, Forest Department, Department of Fisheries, Seed Certification and Plant Protection Centre, National Fertilizer Secretariat, Registrar of the Pesticides and Department of Import and Export Control, showed that only two (Forest Department and Department of Import and Export Control) out of the seven agencies, had an ‘updated contact point’ and only the Department of Import and Export Control, had a list of ‘restricted/prohibited items.’ The National Fertilizer Secretariat performed the worst out of the lot with no information available for an updated point of contact, up-to-date application form, information on the time limit the procedure would take, fees, restricted or prohibited list and list of relevant procedures.
“We need to make more information available online and at present, there is no official to be held accountable for not providing information,” Abeysinghe said.
The government however, has promised that with the Right to Information Act coming into effect from February 3, the government would be made more transparent.
More checks
Once an exporter does manage to receive the information needed, the next major roadblock in his/her way is getting the produce out of the country.
“The goods are checked by the Air Force, Quarantine, Sri Lanka Customs and Sri Lanka Cargo. In the process, boxes are opened several times,” explained De Mel, adding,
“Goods which needed to be exported under pre-cooled conditions are being checked under hot-open environments, while the products get exposed.”
Products such as ornamental fish which need to be exported in a dark and cool environment, are checked several times under light and hot conditions, thus disturbing the fish, while many die in the process,” De Mel said.
Though the fish die at the Bandaranaike International Airport, the government continues to encourage ornamental fish exporters to increase their exports. In 2015, the government earned Rs. 2,392 million in export earnings as a result of exports.
Ellawala pointed out that more fish could be exported, if the time taken to export was cut down.
The team at Verite Research, suggested that the officials either pay a visit to the warehouse where the produce is stored under strict conditions to conduct inspections or have adequate facilities and adopt proper procedures if they are to carry out inspections at the airport.
With goods being checked in four places, the checks themselves have become redundant and many exporters have pointed out that it was not even necessary to have the Air Force check the goods, eight years since the end of the war.
“Such procedures lead to increased time and costs, while reducing the quality of the products. We need to cut down on checking time and train those who check,” explained De Mel.
In addition, Sri Lanka Cargo faces further delays due to increased loading times.
“Sri Lanka has requested that producers bring their products to the Airport six hours ahead of departure, while many other major export countries request between 4-1.5 hours. Thai Cargo, which is one of the biggest exporters only expect the products between 1.5-2 hours,” De Mel said.
Abeysinghe pointed out that countries such as Turkey which identified that exporters were spending too much time tied up in unnecessary procedure, introduced a system based on “risk assessments to minimize physical checking.” This had cut down the time spent waiting by more than half.
Dwindling exports
As exporters spend countless hours trying to get their perishable items out of the country, Verite Research’s study revealed many exporters to have said that they decided to simply drop the business or diversify into other areas.
In year 2000, exports made up 33 percent of the country’s GDP, but by 2015, it had dropped to 12.7 percent GDP.
“Associations according to our research, don’t see new exporters coming in,” said Abeysinghe.
“The solutions however are clear and could be controlled by our own government,” she added.
Successive government she said, have stated that agriculture was an important factor in their policy but have done very little to ease trade barriers for agricultural exports.
“Government sectors often work in isolation and lack communication. They also lack a broader view of what they do and the impact of their actions have on the economy,” added Abeysinghe.
This time around too, the Prime Minister has indicated that he wants to make Sri Lanka an important hub for agricultural exports.
“The President and the Prime Minister, have focused their attention on formulating a new agricultural policy. Our policy is anchored on the requirement to make the country self-sufficient in maize, soya beans, chilies, onions and potatoes by 2018 through crop diversification and productivity improvements and graduate into an agri-business from subsistence economy, whereby we would access export markets by 2020,” as stated by Budget 2017.
Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayake in this year’s Budget not only called for an increase in exports, but explained that the government would create “specialized agricultural and fishery export zones in the country. The Ministry of Primary Industries will be allocated Rs. 2,000 million for the establishment of the proposed agricultural and fishery export zones,” stated the Budget.
In a bid to ease procedural barriers, the government also promised to, “Restructure the BOI, the Export Development Board and Sri Lanka Tourism Development Authority, with a view to improve operational efficiency and to facilitate investments. Until the restructuring process is completed, an organization under the name “Agency for Development” will be established.”
Furthermore, the 2017 Budget also stated that, “A high level body who could take policy decisions and clear bottlenecks will be formed to ensure successful implementation and effective monitoring of the export strategy of the country. Therefore, an Export Development Council of Ministers (EDCM) chaired by the President, as mandated by Statute and comprising the Prime Minister and other relevant Ministers, will be appointed. This would synergize the strength of all stakeholders involved in export promotion, development and facilitation, by removing the duplication of work among institutions, ensuring regular monitoring of the progress, taking corrective action and effectively moving towards the achievement of medium to long term export targets.”
The Minister also touched on making information available for all as he proposed to, “make it mandatory for commercial sections of Sri Lankan Diplomatic missions to provide a market guide on products and services of interest to local businesses periodically, which would be made available on websites of the Department of Commerce and Export Development Board (EDB).”
In addition, he stated that the, “EDB would be strengthened to enhance export promotional activities and I also propose that the EDB should actively be engaged in exploring new markets for Sri Lankan exports and carry out extensive brand promotions, particularly for IT, Spices, Gem and Jewelry and to find new markets.”
Amidst these lofty ideals, exporters continue to complain that the main problem lay in getting the goods they have out of the country.
“We don’t advocate the removal of regulations. There should be regulations but they have to be effective, efficient and information has to be clearly communicated,” De Mel said.
Ellawala in the meantime, pointed out that exporters were wasting time by trying solve the bottlenecks, instead of concentrating on exporting more produce.
“Some of these regulations could be taken out, but are you ready to do that? Are you ready to play ball?,” he questioned the government.
