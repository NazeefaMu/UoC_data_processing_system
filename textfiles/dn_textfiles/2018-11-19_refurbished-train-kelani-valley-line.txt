Refurbished train for Kelani Valley line

A refurbished train with five compartments refurbished at a cost of Rs. 70 million was added to the Kelani Valley railway line route on November 17, in fulfilment of a request made by commuters and the media for some time.
The train will service the Colombo Fort – Avissawella and Avissawella – Colombo Fort route, a press release by the Transport and Civil Aviation Ministry said.
The release said the G8 model train imported in 1990 was fully refurbished at the Ratmalana railway workshops, while the compartments were refurbished by a local company.
So far 68 railway compartments have been refurbished and added to railway operations under the programme to refurbish 200 old compartments with modern facilities. Refurbishment of one compartment costs Rs. 12 million as against import of a new compartment which costs nearly Rs. 28 million. This helped the country to save valuable foreign exchange.
The Railway department has planned to import 160 railway compartments and two power sets with a complement of 11 compartments each, produced in India, before the end of this year. Similarly six railway engines would be imported next year to be deployed on the hill country line.
Transport and Civil Aviation Minister Nimal Siripala de Silva who flagged off the train on its maiden run on the Kelani Valley line, said a large member of people including office workers used the Kelani Valley railway line to travel to Colombo. The Railway department earlier failed to add more trains and compartments on the Kelani Valley line due to its preoccupation with catering to commuters on the main lines. But he was happy to fulfil a request made by Kelani Valley commuters even belatedly, after 10 years. He said he has instructed the department to add another train with new compartments within the next two months.
The Minister said they had rendered a great amount of work to uplift the Railway service in recent years. The Kelani Valley railway line would be made a double track line under an ADB aid scheme worth US$ 200 million.
