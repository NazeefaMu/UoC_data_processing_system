Programme to combat childhood obesity

The Health, Nutrition and Indigenous Medicine and Education Ministries are to implement a programme to increase physical activity among schoolchildren and promote healthy eating habits to combat the increasing trend of childhood obesity in the country.
The proposal which was approved by Cabinet last week seeks to implement the following in its programme:
“Allocate a compulsory half an hour for physical activity per day in schools, ban sponsorship for school sports activities by those companies promoting unhealthy food, screen all food advertisements that specifically target children before telecast, establish physical activity promoting outdoor/play areas in all townships and housing projects to promote physical activity of children which can include the family, control selling of unhealthy food items within 100 metres from school premises, take policy decisions to limit the production of unhealthy food, labelling and stating nutritional value of the food items should be made compulsory, the upper sugar limit of the yellow colour code should at least be reduced to 6 percent from the present 11 percent, prevent school children from appearing in media advertisements which promote food items containing high levels of sugar, salt and oil, prohibit serving unhealthy food items in programmes in which school children are participating”.
Around 59 percent of deaths in Sri Lankan are caused by Non-Communicable Diseases (NCDs) and the majority of these deaths are under the age of 60. Out of the four main risk factors identified for development of NCDs; namely unhealthy diet, physical inactivity, exposure to tobacco smoke or the effects of the harmful use of alcohol, the Ministry of Health has identified, “Unhealthy diets and physical inactivity as the two risk factors commonly seen among adolescents in Sri Lanka”.
