Iconic Green Cabin to shut down

The iconic Colombo restaurant - Green Cabin - known to at least five generations, is to close its doors permanently on Tuesday, July 31.
The property in Colombo 3, has been sold to a leading blue chip in Colombo.
It was originally opened in 1936 by Mrs de Vos, who opted to sell the business in 1942, soon after the Japanese air raids.
The late entrepreneur Cyril Rodrigo, of Pagoda fame, saw a lucrative business opportunity and bought it.
Both Pagoda and Green Cabin kept open during World War II and reaped the harvest.
Over the years, it was a popular venue for eating out and takeaways.
A recent change in the management of the family-owned company has resulted in the new directors wanting to sell the business.
Employees are to be transferred to the outdoor catering unit in Pepiliyana.
