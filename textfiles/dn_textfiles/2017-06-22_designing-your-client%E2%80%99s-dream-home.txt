Designing your client’s dream home

Archt. Sunil Lamahewa has coupled conventional architectural thinking with philosophy. ArchWorld features Archt. Susil Lamahewa whose effectiveness is at its best when his mind is at peace.
“Anything and everything is different all the time because “Everything in the world is in the process of changing.” Anything and everything is different all the time because “Everything in the world is in the process of changing.” As there is no permanent, unchanging substance. Nothing passes from one moment to the next”. This is a quote from the book - What the Buddha Taught by Walpola Rahula. This applies to the material world or the physical world,” said Lamahewa.
To identify the taste of people is not that easy, your client needs to be fully understood when you are designing a home for him. His way of thinking, likes and dislikes, kind of life, social background, education what exactly will fit him, all need to be taken into consideration.
“Therefore understanding a clients’ taste is not that easy in this part of the world. So I visit a client a couple of times and move with him, talk / discuss about art and his living style. After a few meetings and visiting the site with him I get a glimpse of his tastes that needs to be identified and understood,” stated Lamahewa
Taste cannot be explained; therefore we need to experience the taste. Your design will be based on the taste of the user, then only will it become a unique place.
“This doesn’t mean that typical housing or mass housing is a failure, but the interior of the volumes can be transformed to a desired place. The user should feel it with the spaces in it. The sequences of interlinked spaces should talk to the user, making him feel comfortable within the vividly created volumes. The house or building should be fit to live in harmony and in peace,” said Lamahewa
Lamahewa says the “Sun is mother of all energy” in the earth.
“Sun shine has become part of our lives as architects. We use the sunlight to enhance the function of built spaces during the day time. In tropical countries sun light needs to be controlled and in cold countries we need to take sun as much as possible into the designed spaces based on the requirement. It would be magical to use the morning sun, afternoon sun and evening sun in one space to create different moods at various times of the day. The craft of channeling the sun into spaces will determine the mood. This mood setting is determined by the natural light and the direction of the sun. One can achieve it with other architectural design elements if used correctly.
The quality of sunlight and its direction can be used as a design element/ a design principle. The materials that receive the sunlight, gives color, and reflection of light off the surfaces will illuminate the spaces. The textures and colors of material surfaces will enhance the volume of space. Material surfaces and colors play a major role in articulation of the built volumes,” explained Lamahewa.
When you get sunlight into the spaces it comes with heat as well. It is light and heat. You may have to control it or filter or defuse it to the level that you need to. In tropics sunlight is controlled by long eaves, smaller opening and thick walls.
“Ventilation also can be controlled by varying the size of openings, directions and its locations. The best examples are houses with verandahs and courtyards. If the control of light, temperature and ventilation can be combined into the built spaces as required by design, they may stay as timeless designs provided that the spaces are in order to satisfy the user,” added Lamahewa.
Using wind and controlling it in buildings makes the ventilation happen.
“Air has to be circulated or changed. The natural ventilation is the best and it’s free of charge. You only need to be creative enough to handle it carefully. Here we get two monsoons where you get wind and rain together. Therefor the orientation of your buildings are so important. The interiors of the building get heated up due to various reasons - Blocking of natural ventilation, heat emitted by cooking and other works, heat emitted by occupants and heat transfers through openings and walls,” said Lamahewa.
Experiencing nature is probably the best healer- for a tired mind. You may call it stress.
“When designing spaces we can experience nature, by connecting interior spaces to the outside world at least by vistas (using a hole in the wall is the beginning of this). So the answer to this may be an open house. The use of a courtyard or sky lights might add to the design, but it has to evolve with the concept and the design. These linking elements to nature will enhance the creation,” said Lamahewa.
Orientation of the house and use of exposed materials are very important, while play of small and large spaces makes the composition of a design better.
“The landscape and interior of the place also matter adding beauty and enhancing the spaces. Your built space does not change but landscape changes every day,” stated Lamahewa.
Color and lighting certainly will change the moods. Colors have meanings. Lighting on colored surfaces will change the atmosphere drastically if not used properly. There are deep theories on those areas.
“In today’s context with the advancement of technology, now we are passing through the Information Era. Information matters now. Think freely, take time to think, read, listen, travel and enjoy thoroughly what you are doing. Do not fear to use new materials after careful analysis of them at the right place and in the right time. Remember architecture is for people. I believe if a client is understood by the architect, the architect will be able to tap into his mindset and he will be able to create the desired spaces of the client. Based on the requirement it will be for today as well as the future,” shared Lamahewa.
Lamahewa certainly loves his job.
“I do not get stressed because I love designing. I am in a happy mood when I am involved in a design. I am always engaged in something related to it. When I feel like my brain is tired I meditate a little. But now I listen to music or go on an outing with my camera. Sometimes I read something totally irrelevant to my field or look at my numismatic collection. Meditation helps a lot for clear thinking and recharging. If there is no peace of mind and no proper thinking it will lead to a bad design. Design for someone cannot be done mechanically, it’s like composing a piece of music, or making a piece of art,” explained Lamahewa.
Well, large projects have large problems while small projects have small problems. But design wise both will have same parameters to meet.
“The Architect’s responsibility is the same, immaterial to the size of the project. Sometimes you need to get together with some others to deliver a large project and it becomes a collective approach and team work. The process is the same, huge projects also need to be designed by an architect. It may be a large complex of low rise clusters or hi-rise buildings with a small foot print. The amounts of the design problems are the same, it’s only the size that has changed. Architect cannot create it alone. The creation is formed with many others input. Other building professionals, contractors, skilled workers and un- skilled workers. Everybody’s contribution is required by an architect to make his dream a reality for his client,” summed up Lamahewa.
