SP Governor highlights development goals: ‘Over 30,000 country’s tanks underutilised’

Over 30,000 tanks in the country have not been used for development to date.
The ancient kings built tanks and these should be used for present needs, Southern Province Governor Dr. Hemakumara Nanayakkara said.
He was addressing a meeting at the Angunakolaplessa town hall where self-employment goods were distributed to the needy under the 2017 poverty eradication programme.
Water of the Angamedilla wewa and Rewathee wewa was pumped to the highlands via canals in the ancient time, he said.
The governor added that the country has several fully-fledged salterns but salt is imported. He said the country produces only 35 percent of milk and the rest is imported as packeted milk powder. Hemakumara said fish is imported because modern fishing methods are not used though the country is surrounded by the sea. We import green gram from Australia and kurakkan from other countries althogh we have a fertile soil in our country.
About Rs. 15,000 to 20,000 billion is spent to import consumer items annually, he said.
