Thai-Lanka battle at 129th Sri Lanka Amateur golf semis

Top ranked Kaewchareon from Thailand cruised through to the first semi-final brushing aside Husni Uwise from Sri Lanka in the quarterfinal clash of the 129th Sri Lanka Amateur Golf championships held at the Victoria Golf course in Digana yesterday.
Second ranked Namuangruk from Thailand defeated Harimohan Singh of India to secure his place in the second semi-final.
Meanwhile, Sisira Kumara held the lead throughout the game to sustain the challenge and overcome Tapendra Ghai from India to earn a semi-final meeting with Thailand’s Kaewchareon.
M Arumugam beat N Amarapathma 1-up in a tight all Sri Lankan quarter final encounter. Earlier Arumugam created a mild upset defeating the in-form Sanjeewa 3/2 in the second round.
Friday’s golf at the Victoria Golf & Country Resort’s golf course will be an enthralling day, with the Sri Lanka Ladies Amateur Championship teeing-off at 7.30 a.m. where an all Thailand final will take center stage.
In the semi-finals, top ranked Apichaya Yubol beat Gurjot Badwal of India 2 & 1, with the Indian girl giving a determined performance. In the second semi-final M. Zeemakorn over powered Taniya Minel of Sri Lanka who was in there up to the 11th hole fighting tooth and nail the match being all-square. However, a missed birdie and a pushed tee shot allowed Zeemakorn to seal the match 4 & 3. Nonetheless, Taniya Minel’s performance in being the third best qualifier and defeating Anisha Padukone of India in the quarter final is very encouraging for Sri Lankan ladies golf.
