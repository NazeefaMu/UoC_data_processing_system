STF deployed to Angunakolapelessa prison from October 17

The Police Special Task Force would be deployed for security operations of the outer perimeter and search operations at the Angunakolapelessa prison on October 17, STF Commandant Senior DIG- M.R.Latiff said.
He told the Daily News that it has been decided to employ the Special Task Force (STF) to ensure the security in prisons and shortly all operations at the Welikada Prison would also be taken over by the STF.
This is part of the measures taken to curb racketeering operations in prisons. Earlier, it was revealed that drug kingpins were operating their drug distribution operations from within the prisons and it was also revealed that despite a ban on mobile phones within prisons, these drug operators were engaging in their illegal operations using mobile phones. It was also alleged that these illegal operations are being carried out with the assistance of certain prison staff.
