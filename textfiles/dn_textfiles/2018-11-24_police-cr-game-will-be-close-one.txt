Police - CR game will be a close one

CR & FC will go all out to point by overcoming Police sports club in their Dialog 'A' Division League first round rugby match at Police Park today. Kick off will be at 4.00 pm.
CR forwards along with their speedy three quarters gave a superb performance against Navy sports club last week where they pulled off a stunning 28-22 win, will have to come up with a much improved performance if they hope to overcome the Cops in their own den.
The lads from Police Park lost to Kandy 23-32 after a sensational performance where their number eight Shanaka Harischandra and ex Isipathana flanker Vageesha Weerasinghe had an out standing game scoring two tries in their first round game played at Nittawala in Kandy last week and another terrific tussle for supremacy can be expected today. And it won't be a surprise if police sports club pull off a stunner against the red shirts today.
