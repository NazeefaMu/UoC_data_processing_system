10 pc fare increase for  schoolchildren in Kandy

The Kandy School Service Transporters’ Welfare Association has decided to increase fares charged from schoolchildren by ten percent, consequent to the fuel price hike.
Accordingly, the current monthly fare charged from each child is likely to be increased by Rs. 250 to Rs. 500.
Some parents who have two to three school-going children, expressed concern about the fare increase saying their monthly transport bill would increase by nearly Rs. 1,000.
They expressed hope that the government would intervene to resolve this problem by announcing a standard fare in respect of school vans and buses.
