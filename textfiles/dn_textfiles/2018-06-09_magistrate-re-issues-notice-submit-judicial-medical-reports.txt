Death of British rugby players in Colombo:
Magistrate re-issues notice to submit judicial medical reports

Colombo Fort Magistrate Lanka Jayaratne yesterday re-issued notice ordering to submit descriptive judicial medical reports of the British rugby players who died in a leading city hotel in Colombo on May 12.
The Court ordered that the JMO reports of Thomas Baty (26) and Thomas Andrew Howard (25) be submitted before Court on or before June 20.
The two deceased were part of a group of 26 persons who had come from the UK to take part in a rugby tournament. The two rugby players had suffered from breathing difficulties and later had been admitted to the hospital where they were pronounced dead. However, witnesses told the Magistrate that they had gone out to purchase some drugs. The Magistrate fixed the hearing for June 20.
