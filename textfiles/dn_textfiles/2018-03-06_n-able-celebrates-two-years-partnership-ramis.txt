N-Able celebrates two years of partnership with RAMIS

Led by CEO Peter D’Almeida, N-Able, a prominent and skilled technology services company in Sri Lanka, recently marked the completion of their second year of partnership with the state Revenue Administration and Management Information System (RAMIS).
RAMIS is the largest IT project undertaken by the government to-date, allowing individuals and corporates to file their taxes online, which is a significant leap forward for the country both in terms of technology and development.
Every year, extensive man hours and thousands of rupees are needlessly wasted as a result of the manual filing process. RAMIS was therefore specifically targeted and designed to eliminate this, offering Sri Lanka a more globally synchronised platform for its tax purposes. This is one of many positive movements seen mobilised after the end of the 30 year long civil war, which will in turn have long-term benefits elevating the country as a whole.
This support service was awarded to NCS, an organisation in Singapore, a subsidiary of Singtel. As the prime solution provider, NCS was in search of the most competent technology partner; in order to build, run and maintain a system as extensive as this, unparalleled expertise and exceptional knowledge were core requirements, and thus N*Able was sought out as the infrastructure architect for RAMIS.
The customer support centre has a dedicated team of service agents who assist customers with using the RAMIS system, and provides timely, accurate and dependable backing to assist with the increased adoption of RAMIS. Some of these services include dispensing taxpayer guidance for E-services & other tax services, dealing with business and technical issues, and troubleshooting complications that arise in an efficient, effective manner.
Since launching the new electronic system, there have been significant improvements in tax collection overall, such as the total revenue collection in 2016 amounting to Rs. 641,547, effectively marking an increase of Rs. 81,123 or 14.47% over that of the previous year. New registrations have also been made under different types of taxes, further effectively streamlining an otherwise complicated and tedious process.
‘We at N-able (PVT) Ltd are proud to have been sought out for this project, and to be entrusted with the task of managing the back-end operation, whilst further providing efficient services to our end customer, the IRD (Inland Revenue Department) and partner NCS, via this ‘National Platform’ RAMIS for the last two years. This initiative has allowed us to directly contribute to the second largest government revenue/income source, thereby shouldering the development of public infrastructure and facilities for the people of Sri Lanka,” said Chaminda Welikanna, Head of Service Support & Managed Services Operations.
N-Able is a technology services company that sells business outcomes. Over the past 10 years, it has established itself as a unique provider of solutions and technologies that enables businesses to create unprecedented value for their customers and stakeholders in telecom, banking, government and large enterprises.
