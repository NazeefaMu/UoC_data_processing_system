EU, US, Australia welcome peaceful resolution of political crisis

The European Union in a joint statement yesterday welcomed “the peaceful and democratic resolution of the political crisis in Sri Lanka accordance with the constitution”.
In a brief statement, the EU further said, “As steady friends of Sri Lanka, we welcome the peaceful and democratic resolution of the political crisis in accordance with the constitution. We commend the resilience of Sri Lanka’s democratic institutions and will continue to support its efforts towards national reconciliation and prosperity for all”.
US Ambassador to Sri Lanka and Maldives Alaina B. Teplitz in a similar note said, “The US welcomes the last weekend’s political developments, which upheld Sri Lanka’s democratic and constitutional norms”.
Ambassador Teplitz in a message posted on her official Tweeter added, “SriLanka is a valued partner in the Indo Pacific and we look forward to continuing to develop our relationship with the government and people of this country”.
Australia’s High Commissioner to Sri Lanka Bryce Hutchesson also issued a statement to welcome resolution of the political uncertainty in Sri Lanka by constitutional means.
“As a longstanding friend and Indian Ocean neighbour, Australia welcomes resolution of the political uncertainty in Sri Lanka by Constitutional means and the demonstrated resilience of Sri Lanka’s democratic institutions. We look forward to working with the Sri Lankan Government to take forward its commitments to deliver peace, reconciliation and prosperity, and to build a stronger bilateral relationship,” he said.
Following the October 26 coup, the Ambassadors of the European Union, France, Germany, Italy, The Netherlands, Romania, the High Commissioner of the United Kingdom, as well as the Ambassadors of Norway and Switzerland expressed their concern on the situation in Sri Lanka and called on President Maithripala Sirisena to summon Parliament immediately.
The US Embassy on November 10 issuing a strongly-worded statement said President Sirisena’s decision to dissolve Parliament posed a vital threat to Sri Lanka’s democratic institutions.
“There is much at stake and such actions jeopardize Sri Lanka’s economic progress and international reputation. We call on the President to respect this country’s democratic tradition and the rule of law, and to fulfill the commitments to good governance and democracy upon which he and his Government were elected,” the statement added.
Australian Foreign Affairs Minister Marise Payne issuing a statement on November 10 expressed Australia’s concern and disappointment with President Sirisena’s decision to dissolve Parliament on November 9. “As a longstanding friend, we believe this action undermines Sri Lanka’s long democratic tradition and poses a risk to its stability and prosperity. We urge respect for the country’s democratic institutions and for all parties to continue to exercise restraint” she said.
