Chief of Defence Staff Admiral Ravindra Wijegunaratne appeares before the Colombo Fort Magistrates

 Chief of Defence Staff Admiral Ravindra Wijegunaratne appeared before the Colombo Fort Magistrates Court a short while ago.
He appeared before courts over the hearing of the abduction of 11 youths.
The former Navy Commander is accused of shielding a navy officer allegedly responsible for abductions and killings.
Police recently told the court the admiral had protected Chandana Prasad Hettiarachchi, a navy intelligence officer who is the main suspect in the abduction and disappearance of 11 youths between 2008 and 2009.
