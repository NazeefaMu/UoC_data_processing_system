Ceylon Chamber’s ‘Future of  Business’ event  on May 17

 Leading manufacturers from diverse sectors will share their expert insights on how they have improved productivity through process innovation in order to plug into global value chains, at the upcoming ‘Future of Business – Innovation Strategy and Learning Event’ of the Ceylon Chamber.
The session titled ‘Propelling Productivity - The Role of Process Innovation’ will focus on the requirements of businesses to streamline and effectively manage day-to-day processes in order to be globally competitive.
As consumer preferences and needs evolve; resources deplete;margins narrow with pressures from costs and buyers; and competition intensifies amidst Sri Lanka’s trade liberalization, firms which are innovative in managing their processes will progress forward.
Reyaz Mihular, Managing Partner, KPMG in Sri Lanka will deliver the session presentation. He will then join Samath Fernando, CIO, Hirdaramani Group; Prabhash Subasinghe, Managing Director, GRI; Nalin Karunaratne, CEO, Ceylon Biscuits Limited (CBL), who will share their unique and practical insights in a panel discussion.
