Plans to launch Pakistan Alumni Society of Sri Lanka

The Pakistan High Commission in Sri Lanka will launch Pakistan Alumni Society of Sri Lanka to foster, encourage and promote close relations between the people of Pakistan and Sri Lanka and to support prospective Sri Lankan students going to Pakistan for higher education.
The society will connect the universities of both countries under scholarship programmes. Through the Alumni Society, the public and private sectors as well as civil society will be able to build networks and create professional opportunities that will contribute to the development of the two countries. The alumni society will engage the members and provide them means to learn, integrate and share what they learned during their education/training for the benefit of a larger community.
The initiative will help in exploring opportunities for exchange visits by Alumni. It will provide guidance, useful information/tips and contacts for fresh graduates before their departure to Pakistan and vice versa.
Sri Lankan citizens who received professional qualifications or attended short or long term training programmes in Pakistan could join the society.
