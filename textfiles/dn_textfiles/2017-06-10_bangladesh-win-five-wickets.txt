Bangladesh win by five wickets

CARDIFF June09: A fifth wicket stand of 224 runs between Shakib Al Hasan (114) and Mahmudullah (102 not out) helped Bangladesh to beat New Zealand by five wickets in a Champions Trophy clash at Cardiff on Friday.
Bangladesh made 268 for five wickets in 47.2 overs in reply to New Zealand total of 265 for 8.
Mossadek Hossain marked his return to the Bangladesh side by taking three wickets as New Zealand slumped to a total of 265 for eight in a must-win Champions Trophy clash at Cardiff on Friday.
New Zealand were well set while captain Kane Williamson (57) and Ross Taylor (63) were sharing a stand of 83 -- their third fifty partnership in as many matches this tournament.
But, as happened in their no-result washout with Australia and defeat by England, the Blackcaps’ innings collapsed once the experienced batsmen were out in quick succession.
Mossadek, chosen ahead of fellow off-spinner Mehedi Hasan, took two wickets in three balls on his way to impressive figures of three for 13 in three overs.
Fast bowler Taskin Ahmed, Bangladesh’s other change to a side that escaped with a no result against Australia, took two for 43 in eight overs.
New Zealand, who had been 152 for three off 30 overs, only managed 113 more runs in the last 20 overs.
Given 300 is now generally regarded as a ‘par score’, Bangladesh were on top at the half-way stage -- especially as Williamson had won the toss.
Both Bangladesh and New Zealand had to win this Group A match to stand a chance of going through to the semi-finals, although a victory for Australia against England at Edgbaston on Saturday would see them join the already-qualified tournament hosts in the last four.
New Zealand opener Martin Guptill was in excellent touch after the match started an hour late due to rain and drove Bangladesh captain Mashrafe Mortaza for six.
But Bangladesh’s change bowlers removed both Luke Ronchi and fellow opener Guptill to leave New Zealand 69 for two.
The extra pace of Taskin, recalled instead of batsman Imrul Kayes, appeared to surprise Luke Ronchi (16), a mistimed pull lobbing gently to Mustafizur Rahman at mid-on.Guptill’s 33 then came to an end when he was lbw to Rubel Hossain. Williamson, fresh from scores of 100 and 87 against England and Australia, showed his class with several elegant fours.
Taylor too drove Taskin down the ground before sweeping spinner Shakib Al Hasan for four.
Williamson went on to complete a 58-ball fifty, but he ran himself out as Bangladesh were rewarded for building pressure. – AFP
