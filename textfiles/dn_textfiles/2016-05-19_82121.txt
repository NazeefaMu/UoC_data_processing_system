Pesi Shroff visits RTC

 One of India's foremost retired Jockeys and now a leading racehorse trainer Pesi Shroff has been visiting the Royal Turf Club Nuwara Eliya racecourse subsequent to hearing the glowing reports about the conduct of racing in April which was attended by racing enthusiasts from across India . Pesi Shroff has 837 wins, 111 graded races (33 being grade 1 races), 39 classics, and was 8 times champion trainer in Mumbai and twice in Pune After looking around the facilities at the racetrack he was able to renew acquaintances with Wayne Wood the RTC Chief Executive Officer who had also been the Chief Integrity Steward at the Royal Western India Turf Club where Shroff is based.
During their discussions about the RTC Mr Shroff was pleased to hear that race day control remains in the hands of Professional Stipendiary Stewards and that any person aggrieved by their decision has the right to a second hearing by a Board of Appeal. Further that a licensee is entitled to be represented by a lawyer at that stage.
Shroff said he could see that there was much potential for horse racing in Sri Lanka. He admitted that he has a few horses that would be suited to the track and would be giving some thought to the possibility of setting up a stable at Nuwara Eliya. He said that the club giving prize money to fifth placing would be attractive to owners, especially when the size of the fields are taken into consideration. “The Royal Turf Club and the Race Course in Nuwara Eliya certainly have a bright future.
It's got the basics and the additional infrastructure being put into place as per their plans will lay a solid foundation which can then be the stepping stone or a launching pad which will take things to a much higher level “ said Mr Shroff. “The passion, the determination and the will to make this succeed is what has really impressed me because more than anything else, it's the Love for the Game that has to be the driving force. What's even better is that the RTC approach to the task could not have been better orchestrated. They have put in place the top professionals to captain their cause. Professionals who are not only equal to the task but share the same resolve and love for the Sport and with that sort of driving force behind it I can visualise the Race Course at Nuwara Eliya coming into it's own and graduating into a Racing Centre second to none”.
A new state of the art Veterinary Hospital, qualified Vets, a Training Track, and improved and additional stabling facilities which will soon be in place, will enable the RTC and racing in Sri Lanka to stage a comeback to those glorious days of the past when the top horses and professionals had The Emerald Isle as a major port of call.
Pesi Shroff’s stamp of approval for the RTC augers well for the future of horse racing in Sri Lanka.
