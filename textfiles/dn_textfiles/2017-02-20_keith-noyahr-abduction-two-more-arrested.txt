Keith Noyahr abduction : Two more arrested

The Police yesterday arrested two more suspects in connection with the 2008 abduction, assault and false imprisonment of senior journalist Keith Noyahr.
The Police said the two suspects were Corporals of the Army and they had been arrested by a special team from the CID in the wee hours of yesterday.
The Police said the arrested suspects were currently under interrogation and they would also be produced before the Mount Lavinia Magistrate Courts later in the day. Last Friday, the Police arrested three Sri Lanka Army personnel in connection with the Keith Noyahr abduction and assault.
They had been remanded till March 3 after being produced before Mount Lavinia Acting Magistrate Rathna Gamage. Noyahr had been abducted on May 11, 2008 by unknown persons. Releasing a statement following the incident, the publishing company where Noyahr worked claimed the abduction followed a series of threats against Noyahr.He was known for his critical analyses of Sri Lanka’s security situation during the war in his column which he wrote under a pseudonym.
Though the Police set up three investigation teams, the arrests have come after nine years into the incident despite protests and calls by journalists for severe action against the perpetrators.
