Inquiry into if Malaka Silva violated court orders to enter a nightclub

 
The Colombo Chief Magistrate’s Court today issued an order directing the Colombo Crimes Division (CCD) to carry out an investigation over an allegation that Malaka Silva, son of former Minister Mervyn Silva had violated a court order by entering nightclubs.
At a previous occasion, the court had issued an order preventing Malaka Silva from entering nightclubs as a bail condition regarding an assault case.
Counsel who appeared on behalf of the aggrieved party complained Colombo Additional Magistrate Daminda Weligodapitiya that they have received information that Malaka Silva had entered nightclubs contrary to a court order.
Accordingly, the case involving an incident where Malaka Silva, son of former Minister Mervyn Silva had allegedly assaulted on a Scottish couple at a nightclub in Colombo was today fixed for Mach 6 by Colombo Chief Magistrate's Court.
The Colombo Crimes Division (CCD) conducting investigations into the incident had informed Court that they have sought Attorney General’s advice regarding two counter cases.
At a previous occasion, the Court decided to name Scotsman James Francis Casserly as a suspect in a case where he had allegedly punched Malaka Silva in the face during the scuffle at a nightclub in Colombo 3, in 2014.
Seven suspects including Malaka Silva, son of former Minister Mervyn Silva were arrested over an alleged assault on a Scottish couple at a nightclub in Duplication Road, Colombo 3 on October 31, 2014. Police complaints were subsequently lodged by both parties claiming they had been assaulted.
As a part of the investigation regarding the Scotsman’s complaint, police had arrested and produced in Court seven suspects including Malaka Silva. They are currently out on bail.
However, the lawyers appeared on behalf of Malaka Silva alleged that police had failed to take legal action regarding their complaint that Malaka Silva was severely assaulted by Scotsman  and even had a scratch on Malaka’s nose.
Taking into consideration the evidence placed before Court, Additional Magistrate decided to name James Francis Casserly as a suspect. The magisterial inquiry into two counter cases were fixed for March 6.
Jayantha Weerasinghe PC with Counsel Asela Rekawa, Maithri Gunaratne appeared for Malaka and other suspects. Counsel Avendra Rodrigo appeared for the Scotsman.
