Instructions to issue cash vouchers for uniforms

All school heads have been instructed by the Education Ministry to issue cash vouchers to schoolchildren for the purchase of uniform materials on time.
Certain school principals are reported to have ignored the circulars and have tried to provide uniform materials to students instead of cash vouchers. The irregularity was pointed out by some media recently. Errant school principals would be punished legally in the future and relevant Zonal Directors of Education have been instructed to look into such malpractices, Education Minister Akila Viraj Kariyawasam said.
“Students can buy their uniform materials at any textile shop they prefer and school heads have no right to influence students in this regard,” said Minister Kariyawasam.
