First ever TAVI performed at Durdans Hospital

The first ever balloon expandable transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) (without open heart surgery) was performed on an 82 year old patient with Ischemic Heart Disease and poor lung function by Dr Pandula Athauda-Arachchi Resident Consultant Interventional Cardiologist of Durdans Hospital. This was the first time that a procedure of this nature was done in Sri Lanka under local anaesthetic without any complications, with the patient being fully awake.
Previously, the patient had had a stent placed and undergone a balloon aortic valvuloplasty (BAV) performed by Dr Athauda Arachchi which was a temporary solution to buy more time until long term treatment was made available. The continuing deterioration of the patient’s condition prompted Dr AthaudaArachchi to obtain permission from the ethics committee of the hospital (since it was a first time procedure) to implant a transcatheter aortic valve. Owing to the experience and TAVI accreditation gained by doctor as a Consultant in the UK this first time procedure was deemed possible along with the availability of the valve.
After conducting thorough TOE and CT assessments, the procedure, a minimalistic approach without any surgical input, was performed by inserting a catheter through the groin arteries under local anaesthetic only where the patient was awake for the entire procedure. Pre-dilation balloon expansion was administered, the aortic valve assembled through the aortic annulus and the valve implanted under rapid pacing. Resulting in a perfect aortic valve without any complications or bleeding during or after the procedure.
“Immediately after the procedure the patient was able to perform activities such as eating, passing urine, etc and 12 hours after the procedure patient was able to get out of bed and mobilise. The results are comparable to patients I have treated similarly in United Kingdom,” Dr said.
“We want to get the technology in here because there are many heart valve patients who are declined surgery due to co-morbidity. These patients can be treated with this minimalistic approach. At Durdans, the presence of comprehensive heart teams with cardiac surgical/ cardiac anaesthesia backup helps cardiac specialists boldly perform procedures like this without hesitation,” he added.
