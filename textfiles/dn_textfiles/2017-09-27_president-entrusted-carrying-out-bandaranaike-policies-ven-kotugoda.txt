President entrusted with carrying out Bandaranaike policies - Ven Kotugoda Dhammawasa Thera

Mahanayake of the Amarapura Maha Nikaya Most Ven Kotugoda Dhammawasa Thera said President Maithiripala Sirisena has been entrusted with the duty of carrying out the Bandaranaike policies.
The Thera added that former Prime Minister SWRD Bandaranaike left an indelible imprint in the hearts of people of all communities by providing invaluable service to the people at grass root level.
“The late Prime Minister made the Sinhala language as state language while ensuring equal status to other languages too”, the Thera said.
The Mahanayake Thera was delivering the Anusasana at the 58th death anniversary of former Prime Minister S.W.R.D. Bandaranaike at the Horagolla Bandaranaike Samadhi yesterday.
The Thera said that former Prime Minister Sirimavo Bandaranaike took the responsibility of implementing the Bandaranaike policies after her husband’s assassination in 1959.
“Former President Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga also implemented these policies when she held the presidency. The incumbent President is also carrying his policies forward”, the Thera added.
