Arrested for possession of police pistol

Panadura Chief Magistrate Chandana Liyanage remanded Upendra Pumal Fernando till May 25 pending investigations into a charge of possession of a pistol allegedly stolen from the Panadura South Police Station armoury, three years ago.
Panadura Police Crime branch officer Sgt Edirisinghe, submitting a report to the Chief Magistrate, stated that the number of the pistol had been erased and sought the permission of the court to forward the pistol to the Government Analyst for examination and report. The application was allowed.
However, the police identify the pistol as the one which had been stolen from the Panadura Police armoury.
The suspect was arrested two weeks ago while he was in a house in Angulana, Moratuwa, and recovered the stolen pistol.
