Get rid of the paining head

Consultant ENT Surgeon Dr. Ms. Chandra Jayasuriya (MBBS (Colombo), D.L.O.M.S (Otolaryngology), FRCS (Edin) the Head of the ENT Unit of the Colombo National Hospital speaks about some very common issues related to headaches, possible solutions / treatment for such issues and other related facts.
Q - What cause headaches?
A - There are two causes. The first cause is the pathologies occurring inside the skull (Intra cranial) and the second reason is the pathologies occurring outside the skull (Extra cranial). The Intra cranial causes concerns contents within the skull such as brain, blood vessels, membranes covering the brain (meninges) and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) which cushions the brain in the skull. If the volume of any of the contents is increased, pressure inside the skull rises. This causes severe, intractable headache resistant to pain killers.
The patient may have disturbed sleep patterns and may awake due to pain. The patient may wake up with severe pain. Vomiting and fits may also occur. These symptoms will cause a doctor to suspect an intra cranial pathology. A thorough examination of the nervous system (including examination of the eye with an opthalmoscope) is required. Brain scans (CT and MRI) are necessary to confirm the diagnosis. Intra cranial infections leading to abscess formation infections can spread directly through skull fractures or indirectly from ears and nasal sinuses through meninges is another reason for headache.
Intra cranial bleeding due to head injury or spontaneous rupture of congenitally malformed blood vessels is another reason for headache. Brain tumour leading to increase skull pressure (abnormal growth of nerve cells, meninges or blood vessels or hydrocephalus), increased cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) content within the skull also can cause headache. CSF is between the brain and the meninges (covering brain). Four brain cavities situated within the brain are also filled with CSF. CSF inside and outside the brain gets continuously circulated. The intra cranial pressure increases when circulation is blocked by tumours or trauma.
Extra cranial is caused by diseases of the teeth. Teeth infections or eruption of the last molar may lead to severe headache. People should have a routine dental check up on a six to 12 month basis.
Q - What are the other causes of headaches?
A - A person may not become aware of a gradual decrease of eyesight. Eye fatigue may erupt as a headache. In view of this, every patient with a headache should have his / her eyes examined. At around 40 years of age, the coordination of eye muscles become poor, resulting in poor sight (Presbiopia). There is also the risk of a beginning of cataracts and glaucoma (increased pressure inside the eyeball). It is therefore wise to consult an eye surgeon when one is around 40 years of age.
Sinusitis can also cause headache. The causes for the sinuses getting blocked are allergy, catarrh, viral infection (cold), nasal blockage, administering nasal decongestants for a long time without medical supervision.
Diseases of the joints can cause headache. Other reasons include problems of tempero-mandibular joint (jaw joint), cervical vertebrae (cervical spondylosis) and malocclusion of teeth leading to fatigue of joints and muscles, causing ear ache and headache. The pain may become worse during chewing. Mal dentition should be corrected. Physiotherapy may also help to ease the muscle fatigue.
Cervical spondylosis is a disease of inter vertebral joints and discs of the neck bones, leading to pain and limitation of movement including headache and neck pain and pain running along the arm. Ultimately the spinal code may also get damaged. This can be diagnosed by an x-ray of the neck. Pain killers and physiotherapy will be helpful to overcome this issue.
Q - How can we identify the cause of a headache?
A - Stress headache (Tension headache) can be due to vascular diseases. For an example Migraine, cluster headache ect. The muscles in the scalp and neck experience prolonged spasms due to stress, causing pain in the head and neck. It feels like a band around the head. The pain lasts from minutes to hours. Women are more prone to tension headaches. Approximately 20 per cent of the world population suffer from these headaches. Some are affected by it every day. The pain appears more towards the evening. When it is not severe, it is not an impediment to daily activities. The headaches are accompanied by other symptoms of stress such as poor sleep, anger, tiredness, gastric acid. When you are affected more than 15 days of the month, it is called a chronic tension headache.
The causes for tension headache are as follows.
(1) Wrong seating position at work leading to spasm of neck and head ; holding telephone between ear and neck to answer causing severe neck spasm ; reduced vision also leads to incorrect seating position (hunching over to view computer screen).
(2) Lack of sleep due to work overload.
(3) Depression and anxiety due to problems at work or home leading to increase stress.
(4) Improper chewing leading to tempero-mandibular joint problems (Muscles around the joints to go into spasms and cause difficulty in opening the mouth and when molar and pre-molar teeth are missing, chewing becomes improper resulting in fatigue to the joint)
(5) Hunger also causes stress.
(6) Strong computer and cellular phone lights cause the muscles in the head to contract.
Q - What are the treatments available for those issues?
A - A hot water bath and heat fomentation of the tensed muscles will relieve pain. Massage of tensed muscles after applying warm oil also relieves spasm of muscles. Correct vision, proper posture, reducing the strength of the computer and cellular phone lights, minimizing usage are some other things you can do to avoid headaches. The eyes need a rest from time to time. Therefore focus your eyes to a long distant object (for an example looking out through the window) when you work long hours using a computer. Do relaxation exercises to release stress during your break. Have six hours of sleep per night. Keep a small, flat pillow under your neck. Minimize the use of pain killers as long term use can cause rebound headaches.
