All police stations should monitor daily rainfall: Sagala

Rainfall gauges should be installed at all police stations in the island so that the government won’t be caught unawares in the future, said Minister of Law and Order and Southern Development Sagala Rathnayake at the disaster assessment meeting held at the Matara District Secretariat last Saturday.
“It is the duty of the Department of Meteorology and Irrigation to record and maintain rainfall in the district, but there has been some sort of breakdown in the reports getting through to us, so the police should monitor the rain fall so that we will know as soon as there is excessive rainfall,” he added.
More than 800 mm of rain which fell within two days inundated the Matara district, causing loss of lives and damage which is yet to be assessed.
