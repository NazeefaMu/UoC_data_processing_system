Pets fly first class

The Royal families of the middle east are famous for having pets like fully-grown Cheetahs, Bengal tigers, lions and even the extremely dangerous jaguars!
Another popular pet that is synonymous with the Saudi Royalty is the falcon. These falcons are trained like professionals and treated like kings.
They are given the best food, best places to stay and even fly first class.
Yes, you read that right. The pet falcons of royal families do not travel in the cargo section with the rest of the peasant pets.
They actually sit with the royal family in the first class seats where normal people sit. And if you thought that this is strange, you will be astonished to know that the UAE government has issued more than 28,000 falcon passports between 2002 and 2013. And no, the falcons are perfectly fine with it because they are quite used to flying, you see. Mid Day
