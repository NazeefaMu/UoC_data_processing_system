Two Uma Oya drinking water projects to be completed by June 30

The Attorney General yesterday informed the Supreme Court that two out of the four remaining drinking water projects targeting the people affected by the Uma Oya multi-purpose project are to be completed by June 30.
The Attorney General made this remarks consequent to a Fundamental Rights petition filed by the Centre for Environmental Justice, and four individuals, including M.D.P. Manatunga, who are residents of the Bandarawela area who have been victimised as a result of the Uma Oya multi purpose project.
The Supreme Court was further informed by the Attorney General that the Provincial Director of Agriculture in the Uva Province has taken necessary steps to grant compensation to the farmers whose crops were destroyed by the Uma Oya multi-purpose project.
At a previous occasion, the Supreme Court had ordered the Ministry of Mahaweli Development and Environment to complete its drinking water projects by early this year.
The Attorney General had earlier submitted in Court, a copy of the Cabinet memorandum issued regarding the Uma Oya project. The Cabinet memorandum submitted by the Ministry of Mahaweli Development and Environment had identified the main socio-economic problems in the areas affected by the Uma Oya project.
The Cabinet memorandum stated that the ingress of water into the head face tunnel which occurred on December 4, 2014 resulted in some socio-economic problems including the drying up of wells, developing cracks in houses, damaging crops around the areas of water ingress into tunnel located in the District Secretariat areas of Bandarawela and Ella.
The petitioners claim that as a result of the Uma Oya project, not only have their homes and crops been destroyed, but they have also lost access to clean drinking water, citing this as a violation of their fundamental rights.
Secretary to the Ministry of Mahaweli Development and Environment N.Rupasinghe, Secretary to the Ministry of Irrigation and Agriculture, the Central Environment Authority and the Attorney General have been named as respondents in the petition.
Counsel Ravindranath Dabare with Sugath Atapattu appeared for the petitioners.Deputy Solicitor General Palinda Ranasinghe appeared for the Attorney General.
