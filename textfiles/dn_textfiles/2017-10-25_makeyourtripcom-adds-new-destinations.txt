This is in addition to popular cities like Dubai, Bali, Maldives, Singapore, Sydney and Melbourne, as well as a number of exciting destinations in Malaysia and Thailand.
Interestingly, visitors to Makeyourtrip.com even have the choice of requesting holidays in Europe, Japan, South Africa, South Korea and London, which will be customised based on their preferences.

Trips can also be customised by adding or removing room nights, changing activities, switching transfer modes, and including new destinations. Lastly, costs and booking options can be amended since each is broken down into line items so your hard-earned money is more smartly allocated, with the added feature of changing one's hotel or flights, to further optimise costs, also thrown in.
