Life on the Balcony
No Backyard, Problem

Who among us has not heard these lines of Juliet Capulet? "What's in a name? That which we call a rose/By any other name would smell as sweet.." And who among us does not know that she says these words standing on the balcony of her father's house, while Romeo, unknown to her, stands in the garden, listening to every word she says. The crucial word here though, to us gardeners, is balcony: the balcony that lets Juliet out, even as it welcomes Romeo in: the balcony on which their love takes root and blossoms: the balcony which continues to play a pivotal role in the modern world, too...providing the same romantic aura Juliet knew on her balcony once long ago, in fair Verona.
Just think about it. You can get to know what it feels like to be in a mini paradise, right in the middle of busy Colombo, if you want to: a place where you can relax after a hard days work, a place that is an intimate, manageable, useful, and absolutely stunning oasis right in front of those French doors leading onto what the Marriam-Webster dictionary says is a platform that projects from the wall of a building and is enclosed by a parapet or railing. In other words, a balcony!
Many experts in the field point out that while not every aspiring gardener may have the option of a garden bed, almost every aspiring gardener can find a place to grow. Flowers, vegetables, herbs, even trees are possible if you have a balcony in your house or apartment.
According to Jean Sleigh, The Garden Genie, it is important, though, that you know what kinds of plants will thrive on your balcony, and which won't. It is very easy to determine this: "You need to watch your balcony over a 24-hour period to see where the sun travels, making a note of the range from gentler morning sun through to scorching afternoon rays." She says the cooler your balcony, the lower the temperature, which will affect the type of plants you buy. This will also affect how much watering you do.
If you include dwarf trees and shrubs in your garden, you'll need to plan ahead to ensure they receive enough direct sun daily. The sun's path changes as the days unfold, so take this into consideration as well. Also remember that most flowering plants need lots of sunlight.
If your balcony is mostly shaded, Sleigh suggests 'Chinese Lanterns' (Fuchsias), Falling Stars, and a collection of the Coleus variety, including the Freckles, Prince and Flamingo coleus. If your balcony is sunny you can go for flowers like roses and jasmines.
It is also important to note the wind conditions on your balcony, says Sleigh: "Many balconies suffer from being windswept. Try to find plants that are built for wind and dry conditions".
Plants on sunny balconies need to be watered daily, and putting dishes under the pots will allow the plant to continue 'sipping' water after being watered. Remember, the higher the balcony, the dryer it's likely to be. Until you get accustomed to the water needs of your balcony garden, check your new plants everyday to make sure they haven't dried out. If the balcony does not get sunlight throughout the day, experts say you have to monitor the plants and water accordingly. It is also advisable to raise pots off the ground, so that water can drain freely. And remember to check now and again that all the pots' holes are still open.
Choosing the proper container is always important no matter where you decide to have your indoor garden. But it is even more crucial when gardening on a balcony. Weight and proper drainage is a key factor, no matter what material you choose. Plastic is lightweight and fashionable. Pots made of cement is another option. Saucers under the containers help if the balcony area does not drain well.
It is also important to use caution when placing containers on balconies. Improper placement creates a tripping hazard or an undesirable step-up for children. Make sure that railings and ceilings can support the weight of flower pots or containers with plants in them.
Sleigh says it is important to 'feed' potted plants, as they cannot get their nutrients from the ground. Also, periodically rotate the pots to allow the plants - depending on the plants' preference - to get maximum sun exposure and to prevent lopsided plants and bare patches.
Sleigh also points out that potted plant gardeners need to monitor the growth of their plants, as every few years, most plants will need re-potting due to being 'pot bound'. This means the roots have completely filled the container, and the plant needs to be replanted. She says to replant into a container twice the size of the first one, and add good quality compost and drainage stones.
If you are lucky, once your balcony garden grows, you will have 'wild visitors' who will drop by to say 'hi'. Miriam Settles who blogs at flatbottomflowers.blogspot says "We get bees, goldfinches and toads (in our balcony garden). And there are hummingbirds who love to stick their beaks into flowers. I try to get them trumpet-shaped blooms." Settles is also resolutely against pesticides. "Once the garden is in, I don't fiddle with it."
That's it. When you have decided what plants can work on your balcony, and what containers to grow them in, it is time to start enjoying the 'feel' of your balcony garden. Sydney Eddison once said that gardens are a form of autobiography, so ensure your green haven reflects your tastes.
Finally, when the heavy lifting is done, when the seeds have sprouted, when new leaves begin to show on the Kathurumurunga plant, prepare yourself for kicking back in your mini paradise, maybe with a glass of lemonade made with the lemons growing right on your balcony.
Chances are, as you smile at the young rose plants basking in the morning sunlight, as a yellow butterfly flirts with the jasmines you will have an inkling of what Juliet meant when she wished,"This bud of love, by summer's ripening breath, May prove a beauteous flower when next we meet."
Catch you next week, as you enjoy the 'buds of love' you planted on your balcony, turned into 'beauteous flowers' like 'the fairest stars in all the heaven..." Happy balcony gardening!
