Sarana Gunawardena further remanded until Oct. 16

Former Petroleum Industries Deputy Minister and former Development Lotteries Board (DLB) Chairman Sarana Gunawardena, was further remanded until October 16 by Colombo Fort Magistrate Lanka Jayaratne yesterday.
He is alleged to have misused a state vehicle valued over Rs.8 million while serving as the Development Lotteries Board Chairman during the previous regime.
The former Deputy Minister was arrested by the Colombo Crimes Division (CCD) over the offences he is alleged to have committed under the Public Property Act.
The CCD alleged that former Deputy Minister Gunawardena had continued to serve in the tender board of the DLB contrary to the Lottery Board Act even after being elected to Parliament in 2008 and being appointed as a Deputy Minister.
Police said the suspect had imported the luxury vehicle, valued at over Rs. 8 million. The authorities are yet to trace the vehicle’s whereabouts.
