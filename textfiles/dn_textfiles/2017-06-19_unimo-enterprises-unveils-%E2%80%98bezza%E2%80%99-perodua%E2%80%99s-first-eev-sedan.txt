Unimo Enterprises unveils ‘Bezza’, Perodua’s first EEV Sedan

Unimo Enterprises, a fully-owned subsidiary of United Motors Lanka PLC and the authorized distributor for Perodua vehicles in Sri Lanka unveiled the latest addition to its family of technologically advanced, user-optimized and luxurious range of vehicles.
The “Bezza” from Perodua is the brand’s first Energy Efficient Sedan (EEV) and is the ideal sedan for the modern discerning vehicle enthusiast.
The launch took place at the King’s Court, Cinnamon Lakeside under the patronage of the Malaysian High Commissioner in Sri Lanka, Wan Zaidi Wan Abdullah, President and CEO of Perodua Datuk (Dr) Aminar Rashid Salleh and Executive Director of Perodua Takamasa Kurinami.
Speaking at the launch Group Chief Executive Officer and Executive Director of United Motors Group Chanaka Yatawara said, “Unimo has a longstanding relationship of almost two decades of representing Perodua in Sri Lanka. Throughout these years we have introduced highly successful models such as the Kelisa, Viva and Axia to local vehicle enthusiasts who have come to trust Unimo Enterprises Ltd for the product quality and levels of service on offer through an island-wide branch network and service dealers. The Bezza is not just the first EEV Sedan from Perodua but also the first compact sedan that promises to be different from any other sedan you have driven before.”
The keys to the first fleet of vehicles were presented to proud owner Mahesh Mallawarachchi Associates by distinguished guests Datuk (Dr) Aminar Rashid Salleh accompanied by Takamasa Kurinami, Chanaka Yatawara, and Chief Executive Officer and Executive Director of Unimo Enterprises Ltd Mahesh Gunathilaka.
The “Bezza” which when spelt with one “z” means “different” in Malaysian is a true indicator of the evolving vehicle market globally. Trends from across the world suggest a paradigm shift to lower engine capacity, energy-efficient yet high performance vehicles.
The 1000cc Bezza has won many accolades including the Malaysian Car of the Year in 2016, Asean NCAP Grand Prix Award in 2016, and the Carsifu Editor’s Choice Award for the Best Family Ride of the Year in 2016.
