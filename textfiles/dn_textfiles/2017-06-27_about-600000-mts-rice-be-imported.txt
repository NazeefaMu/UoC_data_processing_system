About 600,000 MTs rice to be imported

The government has planned to import 600,000 metric tons of rice to meet a shortfall in local production expected in the near future due to the recent drought, said Development Strategies and International Trade Minister Malik Samarawickreme.
The drought dried up a vast acreage of paddy land.
Minister Samarawickreme said rice production had dropped by 53 percent due to the drought and he had already discussed measures to import rice with the Vietnam Ambassador.
