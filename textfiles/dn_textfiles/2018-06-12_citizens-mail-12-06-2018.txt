Cancerous issue
Recently it was reported in the papers that the Health Minister has approved of two Russian cancer drugs for use in our cancer hospitals after seeking the advice of the WHO. The GMOA, who has earned a reputation for using other people’s paws for pulling the chestnuts out of the fire, is demanding that the minister first obtain the approval of our oncologists before sanctioning the use of the drugs in our hospitals.
Now before our oncologists grant approval it is presumed they will have to depend not on their intuition but on a fully fledged double-blind trial for which they may not have the competence or the resources. Double-blind trials are costly and highly technical things and not the bread and butter of common or garden oncologists, where the placebo at times, playing a startling role giving a cure rate that supersedes the drug.
The GMOA has a habit of barking up the wrong tree. It is more profitable if they stay in hospitals dispensing the usual panadols and aspirins and not on the roads than get into terrains that are beyond their blockheads.
Then doctors were admired and venerated. Now they are hated and despised for holding the poor and helpless to ransom at the drop of a coin.
