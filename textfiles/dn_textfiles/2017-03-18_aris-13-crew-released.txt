ARIS 13 CREW RELEASED

Deputy Foreign Affairs Minister Dr. Harsha de Silva yesterday said the government’s diplomatic intervention ensured the release of the Aris 13 crew and vessel that was hijacked by Somali pirates.
He emphasised that the crew members were released unharmed and without any ransom demands.
“The Sri Lankan crew was released early yesterday morning. The government intervened to stop the Somali authorities from firing at the oil tanker,”he said.
He was addressing the media yesterday at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
The Deputy Minister further explained, “When we were informed that the pirates and the Somali forces were exchanging fire in battle,Foreign Affairs Minister Mangala Samaraweera and myself spoke to the Sri Lankan crew on board over the phone. They did not know who was shooting but said there were over 70 pirates on board with them and the ship has been surrounded by four boats”.
“The US government helped us to get through to the President of Puntland, the semi-autonomous region of Somalia and his Chief of Staff Abdinasir Sofe. We were informed that the gun fire took place on the orders of the President of Puntland. We requested them to stop the gun fire and emphasised that we need to safeguard the lives of the Sri Lankan crew. They agreed to it and within a few minutes we got a call from the ship that the shooting had stopped. We also requested the President of Puntland to remove their boats from that region, but they finally agreed to move the boats a bit far from the ship and to observe the situation”, he said.
The Deputy Minister said that the government wanted to ensure a smooth discussion between the ship owners and the pirates.
“We were in constant touch with Puntland President’s office through WhatsApp. They were in continuous communication until the Sri Lankan crew was released”, he said.
Minister said that it is a remarkable diplomatic achievement not only for Sri Lanka but for the whole Indian Ocean.
The Regional and global partnership with the naval forces around the globe and the diplomatic intervention of the government helped to solve this problem in a diplomatic way said Director General Operation, Sri Lanka Navy Rear Admiral Dharmendra Wettawa.
He said that the Combine Maritime Forces were constantly giving information to the Sri Lankan Navy about the situation in the Somali region.
“They officially informed me that the ship is nearing the Bosaso port in Puntland and it will be sent off after conducting a health checkup,”he said.
Deputy Minister Dr. Harsha de Silva expressed deep appreciation on behalf of the Government of Sri Lanka, to the President of Puntland, the semi-autonomous region of Somalia, and his Chief of Staff Abdinasir Sofe, who cooperated and collaborated with the relevant officials of the Government of Sri Lanka in securing the release of the vessel and crew.
