Tribute

Rev. Fr. Selvaratnam
Exceptional personage
Achieving a milestone is possible only to those whose minds and hearts are open as well as endowed with strong cognitive powers such as critical thinking, resilient power in critical situations and a strong will to be faithful to their commitments, come what may. People who know Fr. Selvaratnam OMI call him “Selvam,”—in Tamil, it means “wealth”.
He is endowed with such ‘mind treasures’ and has reached many milestones in his life, especially this year; the 75th year after his birth, 50 years of priesthood and 57 years of committed religious life in the Congregation of Oblates of Mary Immaculate.
While the festive melodies swim in the air for Selvam, the milestones he reached in 2017 provide him an enviable opportunity, like that of Greek god Janus, to look both, backward and forward from these positions. Backward reviews award him to gauge his achievements and shortcomings, while forward perception permits him to get a deeper and wide insight to plan out his service with sobriety and tranquility for the future.
Selvam is the second son of the three, born to a devout Catholic couple in ‘Vathiri,’ a hamlet in the village of Karaveddy in the Northern part of Sri Lanka.
He received his primary education from Sacred Heart College, Karaveddy and the secondary, from St. Peter’s College, Colombo; the latter, he did while he was in the Juniorate at Kohuwala, Nuguegoda. Having completed the G.C.E. O/L, he pursued and successfully finished his clerical studies in the National Seminary in Ampitiya, Kandy and was ordained a priest by the then Rt. Rev. Dr. Jerome Emilianuspillai OMI at St. Mary’s Cathedral, Jaffna on December 21, 1966.
His sense of self-confidence, discipline and generous application of himself to projects he undertook, had made his superiors to decide in favour of him to continue his higher studies.
Having completed his B.A in Chennai, he further moved to Lyon, where he did dip-in AV education, and in New York Master’s in Telecommunications. Being fully fledged in the knowledge of his chosen field, consequently, on his return to the country, he launched Tamil Catholic programme called ‘New World,’ broadcasted by SLBC, sharing thus, his know-how, moral, spiritual and psychological insights.
A number of his thought-provoking articles written to Tamil Dailies, those are justifiable, yet irritable to many in power sector and other, brought him great fans as well as controversial thinking figures, all of whom knew him as ‘Selvam.’ He himself took pride in his name ‘Selvam.’ He learnt to use every opportunity as golden and keep his eyes on the prize—his and not anybody else’s.
What were remarkable and the distinguishing factors were his traits of perseverance, and persistence and despite all obstacles, discouragement and impossibilities, he was able to maintain a sense of fortitude in his endeavour.
Due to mounting pressures from various factors against his free thinking expressions, he had to go on exile; however, his resilient nature and open mindedness enabled him to catch every opportunity that came across at each flickering moment.
Given this fact, he further qualified and managed to bag the following higher degrees: M.S. in Psychology in Baltimore, Doctorate in Pastoral Psychology, Counseling from Boston University and Certified full clinical Supervisor with NACC/ACPE, USA. Selvam believed in the axiom of Barnard Shaw, namely, “Life is not only about finding oneself, but life is also about creating oneself.”
On his return to his motherland, he was engaged in training formators, refounded ‘Shanthiyaham’—a counseling center for people who were marked with painful mental scars caused by the civil war.
As an internationally-sought, widely-travelled figure, he conducted many seminars and chapters, in Asian, African and European countries. As he celebrates his platinum, and golden jubilees, I quote him from ‘I am grateful’—a booklet authored by him and in which he quite clearly displays his learning process and growth in spirituality; “Religion is a means to an end, the end being wholeness and oneness.
We have made the means to an end…. Even religions can become an object of consumerism in the sense of people crave for more religion, rituals, vocal prayers, celebrations, elaborate ceremonies, decorations, statutes, holy pictures, pilgrimages; but underneath all there is shallowness that is never addressed even by the majority of Religious leaders…. It is all because they are trying to fill something in the depth with externals that cannot meet thirst in the depth.” Such pep, truthful, as well as critical thinking, would certainly challenge the authorities to take an honest inward journey that would not be so palatable.
As we wish triple blessings on his triple celebrations we are convinced of Robert Frost’s poetic lines that come to be applicable to him where, “Two roads diverged in a wood and I take the one less travelled by and that has made all the difference.”
Perhaps Selvam takes pride in Tagore’s quote:
I slept and dreamt that life was nothing but joy;
I woke and found that life was nothing but service;
I served and realized that service is joy Rev. Sr. M.Concelia Mariampillai HC
