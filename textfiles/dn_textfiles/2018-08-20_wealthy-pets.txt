Wealthy pets!

Have you ever watched a film or TV show and wondered how much an animal has gotten paid for the gig?
Well, it turns out if they’re particularly good at their craft, they earn more than most of us combined. The Grumpy Cat meme, for example, was the gift that kept giving as the famous feline racked up a worth of $99,500,000 (£78,199,040). Since the picture of the bemused cat went viral, she’s had a film made about her, has her own merchandise empire and has a staggering 2.5m followers on Instagram. So who else makes up the rich pet list?
The data, compiled by comparison website Compare the Market, found that the rich pet list was topped by a German Shephard called Gunther IV.
Gunther IV lives a bougie life; he eats steak and caviar and has multi-million dollar homes. Oh and he’s worth more than Kim Kardashian.
Bart the Bear II is a famous actor who has appeared in loads of Hollywood films. One of his most recent roles was in Game of Thrones when he was pitted against Jamie Lannister and Brienne of Tarthe.
Gigoo is the richest chicken in the world, with a net worth of $15m (£11,797,500). To put that into perspective, that’s $2m (£1,573,000) more than model Gigi Hadid.
Social media stars such as Juniper the Fox, Doug the Pug, and Lil Bub are all Insta famous pets. Doug has multiple celeb friends including Ed Sheehan and has also appeared in one of Fall Out Boy’s music videos. Which is more than any of us can say. It’s not just cats and dogs that make up the list of rich pets. Bubbles the chimpanzee, Missy the cow, Csoki the African parrot, and Big Tibby the tortoise are also making some serious dosh. Metro
