Forum for CEOs on Key Features of GDPR in Context of Cyber Security on August 7

The breakfast forum – “A CEO’s Guide to GDPR” being held on August 7, 2018 at Jetwing Colombo Seven, offers the opportunity to hear from industry leaders as to what steps they have taken to be compliant to the E.U General Data Protection Regulation.
Shalini Ratwatte, Head of Legal and Corporate Affairs for South East Asia New Markets at Microsoft will deliver the key presentation. It will then be followed by a panel discussion with Anjali Fernando, Partner FJ & G de Saram, Hasitha Abeywardena, Country Manager for Sri Lanka and Maldives at Microsoft, Shiromal Cooray, Managing Director, Jetwing Travels, and Rakhil Hirdaramani, Director, Hirdaramani Group. Shiran Fernando, Chief Economist, the Ceylon Chamber of Commerce, will moderate the discussion.
GDPR is a significant shift in how personal information will be managed and protected. The exposure to the processing of data of E.U residents and non-compliance is of high financial significance, and makes this an important boardroom discussion. The challenge for leaders in organizations will be to balance the necessary controls while providing the enabling environment for your company to thrive.
A key feature of this breakfast seminar will be a discussion of GDPR in the context of Cyber security. While the seminar will not delve into the technicalities of GDPR, it will aim to cover the key features of the regulation and provide an understanding of its implications, it will also provide guidance in terms of compliance and tools required for implementation.
This event serves as an important opportunity for corporate leaders to be able to provide direction in implementing the new regulations within their companies.
