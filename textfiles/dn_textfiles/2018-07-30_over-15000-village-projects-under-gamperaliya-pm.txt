Over 15,000 village projects under Gamperaliya - PM

Every measure has already been taken to streamline the development of the village through the Gamperaliya and Enterprise Sri Lanka programmes, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said.
Gamperaliya and Enterprise Sri Lanka programmes will strengthen the economy of the village when every village receives funds through these two programmes, he added.
The Prime Minister made these remarks after opening two Divisional Secretariat offices in Eravur and Manmunaipattu in Batticaloa yesterday.
Addressing the gathering, he said the rural community will receive more money through the Gamperaliya and Enterprise Sri Lanka programmes.These programmes will help strengthen the rural economy since villagers will receive more money from these programmes, he said.
The PM said around 15,000 projects will be carried out through the Gamperaliya programmes. Under the Gamperaliya programme, several development and infrastructure development activities such as roads, irrigations including small tanks will be carried out through the Divisional Secretariats. These projects will be completed on time in a proper and transparent tender procedure.
A committee comprising officials of the Finance Ministry has been appointed to select proposals. The secretary of the National Policies and Economic Affairs Ministry will inform the District Secretary of the selected development proposals which are carried out through the Divisional Secretariat offices.
These activities will be evaluated by a committee comprising Ministers Sagala Ratnayake, Eran Wickremaratne, Niroshan Perera and J.C. Alawathuwala.
The Ministers’ committee will monitor whether these projects are carried out efficiently. The committee will provide instructions if any project is behind schedule.
Cold-room facilities will be established with the assistance of the private sector centralising economic centres including Dambulla. Wastage to crops can be minimized by establishing cold storage facilities.
