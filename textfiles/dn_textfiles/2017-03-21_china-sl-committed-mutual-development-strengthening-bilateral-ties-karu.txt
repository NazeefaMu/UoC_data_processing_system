China, SL committed to mutual development, strengthening bilateral ties: Karu

Sri Lanka and China will continue to work to build peace, harmony and prosperity for the citizens of both countries, Speaker Karu Jayasuriya said yesterday.
Speaking at the ceremony to celebrate 60 years of diplomatic relations between Sri Lanka and China in Colombo, Jayasuriya noted that he was pleased to see that both countries continue to be committed to mutual development and strengthening bilateral ties.
“The two countries have been friends for several decades and have taken part in religious, cultural and social exchanges. China has been with us in good times and bad times."
“In the recent past, China has helped us develop our infrastructure, from highways to ports and airports and we are very thankful for that,” he said.
Pang Chunxue, Political Counsellor of the Embassy of the People’s Republic of China, also touched on infrastructure projects in her speech. “China is working to help Sri Lanka realise national development with the goal of helping the pearl of the Indian Ocean to enter a new era of glory,” she said.
The ceremony also marked the 20th anniversary of the Association for Sri Lanka-China Social and Cultural Cooperation (ASLCSCC), which celebrated the occasion by launching its website and ceremonially raising its flag. A token letter for 60 sister schools between Sri Lanka and China was handed over and the International Eye Bank of Sri Lanka handed over a letter pledging the donation of 60 eye corneas to Beijing.
