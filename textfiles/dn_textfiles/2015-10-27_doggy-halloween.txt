Doggy Halloween

The 25th Annual Tompkins Square Halloween Dog Parade took place on Saturday and pooches of all shapes and sizes, and even some of their owners, flaunted their cuteness and creativity. Over 250 dogs strolled down the catwalk in the center of the park to win Best in Show. The grand prize winner would receive an Apple Watch, which is a treat more for the owner instead of the dog, who had to be on display in a crazy costume for hundreds of New Yorkers.
There were costumes ranging from the modest store-bought vampire or pirate getup, to full-blown stroller displays and entire families taking part in group costumes of characters in famous films and books.
