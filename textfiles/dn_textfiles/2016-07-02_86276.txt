A swimming champion emerges from the Foundation of Goodness

Yasindu Kavishani, who trains at the Foundation of Goodness (FoG) Sports Academy’s Bryan Adams Swimming Pool Complex became the first swimmer from the Academy to be placed first at the Sri Lanka Schools’ Aquatic Sports Championship conducted at the Sugathadasa Stadium from 23-26 June.
Kavishani who is a student of Ambalangoda Dharmasoka College took first place in the U19 50m Butterfly event and also placed third at the U19 Girls 100m Freestyle event which was an incredible achievement.

Despite coming from a rural background Kavishani had the rare opportunity to pursue her talent as a swimmer by training at the FoG Bryan Adams Swimming Pool Complex which offers free of charge access and training to all children and youth catering to 50 villages in the Seenigama region.
The pool complex is named after the legendary Canadian singer who sponsored its construction during Foundation of Goodness’ re-development efforts following the 2004 Indian Ocean Tsunami to rebuild the village of Seenigama after destruction, to be even better than before.
Kavishani who is attached to the Foundation of Goodness and all her fellow swimmers receive extensive training at the Sports academy both in and out of the pool including gym sessions, fitness training, nutritional advice and seminars on mental toughness.
In addition, the young swimmers also have the incredible advantage of receiving advice and direction from a number of outstanding sporting personalities who visit the Foundation of Goodness, most recently including American swimming sensation Missy Franklin who is a five-time gold medalist at the London Olympics and will be taking part once more in Rio in the coming months.
Missy Franklin visited the Foundation of Goodness as an ambassador for the Laureus Sports for Good Foundation (UK) who sponsor the FoG Sports Academy and spent time meeting our swimmers and training them herself.
The swimmers also had the opportunity to see the great Olympian go through her own training regimen at the pool which was an absolutely inspirational experience.
Village youth in the region are also most fortunate to be blessed with overseas volunteers training them as well frequently.
Janaka Lal the coach and former long distance swimmer from Ambalangoda has to be commended highly for being the driving force behind her success and training.
The Foundation of Goodness is delighted by Kavishani’s success which showcases the brilliant talent hidden in rural Sri Lanka that only needs access to opportunities and resources in order to excel.
Established in 1999 as a charitable NGO the Foundation of Goodness has worked extensively following the 2004 tsunami that devastated the lives of thousands of Sri Lankans to develop a one of a kind holistic rural community development model which today delivers a wide range of programmes to over 30,000 beneficiaries from 100+ villagers in the South, North and East of Sri Lanka annually, free of charge.
The Foundation operates principally out of the MCC Center of Excellence, Seenigama in the South of Sri Lanka and has also worked extensively with villages in the post-war North and East of Sri Lanka since January 2011, reaching over 27,000 beneficiaries todate, with uninterrupted monthly visits.
