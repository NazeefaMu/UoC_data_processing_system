Cabinet appoints comittee to fast track economy

 
A Central Programme Management Unit (CPMU) to deliver ‘big, fast economic results for the country’ in the next three years was approved by Cabinet this week as concerns over the economy not growing ‘fast enough’ looms over the government.
On September 5, Cabinet approved the proposal to launch a programme to enable “Accelerated Economic Transformation in Sri Lanka and the setting up of a Central Programme Management Unit”. Thereafter, the Minister of National Policies and Economic Management and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe engaged the services of the US Consultancy group McKinsey and Company to prepare a plan for the implementation of such a programme. The agreement between the two parties was signed in November 2016.
Over the first six weeks of this year, Mckinsey consultants met with government agencies and private sector stakeholders to review government and sector plans and conducted analyses to help define a three year Economic Delivery Programme (EDP) for Sri Lanka.
According to documents on the plan, the EDP will only focus on delivering economic outcomes and not the government’s social agenda.
The EDP will mainly focus on increasing, “median income, private sector jobs, investment (both foreign and domestic) exports and government revenue.
Economic accelerators ,unlike the economic priorities of the government which are common to all ministries, will be given more resources and will directly come under the Prime Minister’s purview, the Cabinet Committee on Economic Management (CCEM) and the CPMU.
The McKinsey consultants have identified the three main areas of; tourism, agriculture and manufacturing to be accelerated. In Tourism, they would focus on marketing and international connectivity efforts on six tier 1 countries like India, China, UK, Germany Russia and France and capturing the luxury segment in Tier 2 markets and hubs such as Middle East- Dubai, USA-New York, Singapore, Australia and Japan. Manufacturing will focus on textiles and apparel, electronics manufacture and food and beverage manufacturing while agriculture will have focus directed at improving end to end tea processing, coconut processing and rice. Key enablers of these three sectors have identified to be; investment accelerators, digital economy and government revenue.
McKinsey has also proposed that the accelerators be led by relevant ministers closely supported by an identified private sector ‘Czar’.
They also state that they have developed similar programmes in over 20 other countries and this will be tailored to the unique context of Sri Lanka. The company has charged the government a total of USD 2,997,666 million for their efforts.
‘De-bureaucratising’ the economy and fast tracking investments have been a main concern for the government which has seen a drop of FDIs and domestic investments in the last two years. In March of this year, the CCEM received new powers to engage directly with line ministries and the Board of Investment to fast track investment projects. Given the current trend in economic growth however, the Central Bank is hopeful of a 5-5.5 percent GDP growth by the end of 2017.
