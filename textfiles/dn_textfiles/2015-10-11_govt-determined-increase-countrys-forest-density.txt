Govt determined to increase country's forest density

The government is determined to increase the country's forest density from its existing 29 per cent to 32 per cent in the next three years, President Maithripala Sirisena said yesterday.
The President was speaking at a national ceremony to mark "Wana Ropa" a tree planting programme at Kotmale. The President said he firmly believed the tree planting programme will enhance the country's forest cover.
Drawing attention to the rampant destruction of the country's forests, President Sirisena said this was done by some businessmen and racketeers who only think of financial gains without an iota of thought to the environmental degradation they are causing and its damaging repercussions to the country's future.
The President said it is essential to strictly implement laws to protect the environment and take action against persons who violate such laws irrespective of their status.
The President noted that despite the conflict in the Northern and Eastern provinces a large portion of the forest cover is still found intact. The forests were protected in those areas but forests in other areas faced immense danger.
President Sirisena stressed that he will take all measures, including legal action against wrongdoers to protect forests and wildlife.
"As children of nature, we have a duty and responsibility to protect the environment that we inherited and prevent any human activity harmful to the atmosphere and the ecosystem," he added.
The President planted a "Na" sapling to mark the occasion.
Ministers Lakshman Kiriella, Navin Dissanayake, Deputy Minister Anuradha Jayaratne, Central Province Chief Minister Sarath Ekanayake, Parliamentarian Mayantha Dissanayake, Senior Advisor to the President former Prime Minister D. M. Jayaratne, politicians, state officials and public attended.
