2018 Sri Lanka Junior Golf championship :
Vinod and Taniya clinch top titles

Vinod Weerasinghe cruised to a 6 & 5 victory over Sathsara Dilshan to win the Rukmini Kodagoda Challenge Trophy and the title of Sri Lanka Junior Boys champion 2018. Vinod, winner in 2016 and runner-up in 2017, clinched the Junior champion title for the second time, playing excellent golf in the final.
The Sri Lanka Junior Match-Play Golf Championship, sponsored by P&S Bakers for the fifth consecutive year, displayed beyond reasonable doubt the improvement and development of junior golf in Sri Lanka.
Chairperson of the junior Sub- Committee, Niloo Jayathilake said: “Today, we witnessed some amazing golf by juniors with the girls’ final taking center stage. The first hole saw Kayla sink an amazing 20 foot putt for a birdie with Taniya Minel responding with an eagle to win the first hole. The final produced 3 eagles with Kayla making an eagle on the 7th whilst Taniya added the 11th hole eagle to her 1st hole spectacle and a flurry of eight birdies between them.”
SLGU Council member Niloo also added that even the members and amateurs at the RCGC rarely produced this high standard of golf in a final as displayed by Kayla and Taniya.
Nirekh Tajwani continued his consistent performance to win the Silver Division defeating K. Danushan with consummate ease 5 & 4.
Ten-year-old Shanal Binuksha, a talented junior following in his father’s and grand father’s footsteps cruised to a 7 & 6 victory over M.S. Sanjay of Nuwara Eliya Golf Club to win the Bronze Division. Kaya Daluwatte won the Copper Division (9+ & under) for the second consecutive year defeating Thejas Rathis Kanth comfortably 3 & 2.
The Rukmini Kodagoda Challenge Trophy was given away by Gihan Perera (CEO - P&S) on behalf of the sponsors Perera & Sons Bakers. “We are proud to sponsor the Junior Golf Match-play Championship in memory of the late Rukmini Kodagoda, a Family Director of P&S,” said Gihan Perera.
Rukmini Kodagoda was a star golfer, tennis national champion and above all an exemplary sportswoman who was committed to developing golf from the junior level. The progress and growth of the junior golf is a tribute to the commitment of the Sri Lanka Golf Union president’s vision of laying the foundation at junior level and the untiring efforts of the Junior Sub-Committee of the SLGU focused on promoting golf among children, students and juniors.
