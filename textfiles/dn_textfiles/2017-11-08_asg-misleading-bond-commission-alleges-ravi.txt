ASG misleading Bond Commission, alleges Ravi

UNP MP Ravi Karunanayake complained in Parliament yesterday that Additional Solicitor General Yasantha Kodagoda had been misleading the Bond Commission with concocted stories to bring disrepute to his image.
Raising a privilege issue, Karunanayake reiterated that he is not related to Shanil Neththikumara, the individual who had allegedly threatened Anika Wijesuriya. He said he will resign if proved otherwise.
He said ASG Kodagoda should apologise to the Bond Commission for misleading it with wrong facts. “This individual is not my relation. How can the AG’s Department officials think they know my relatives better than me,” he asked.
He added Anika Wijesuriya, who previously testified before the Commission, has so far not lodged a complaint at any Police station over death threats she had received. He said Anika Wijesuriya has not returned to the country after October 6.
“ASK Kodagoda submitted before the Commission a letter received to the Bond Commission Secretary by Wijith Wijesuriya, the elder brother of Anika Wijesuriya, without checking the accuracy of its information.
The Attorney General Department enacted a drama. I sent a clarification letter on the same to the Commission, but my letter was not submitted before the Commission,” he said while complaining that there is a conspiracy behind the incident.
He said a dispute had occurred between Neththikumara and Anika Wijesuriya following a quarrel at a night club. “When two people clash at a night club, the AG’s Department has accused me,” he added.
