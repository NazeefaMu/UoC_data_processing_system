Mask and movement

Laurie Steven the founder and Artistic Director of Odyssey Theatre, Ottawa, Canada, has been involved in Canadian theatre for the past 33 years. Like many young artists she originally entered the stage when she studied theatre at high school and university. She has been involved in the theatre ever since.
Today she directs productions like Molière’s ‘Sacpin’,Giraudoux’s ‘Ondine’, Marivaux’s ‘False Confessions’, Gozzi’s ‘The Raven.’For her adaptation of an Indonesian shadow puppet play, ‘The Wedding’ she won the Capital Critics Circle Award for Best Director. Her work at Odyssey Theatre focuses on masks, dance-theatre and the arts of the fairground. Laurie is currently in Sri Lanka and shared with the Daily News her passion for theatre and the unique impact mask theatre has on its audience.
Q: For the uninitiated can you describe this form of theatre, dealing with fantasy, reality and puppetry?
Odyssey Theatre, a company in Ottawa Canada, specializes in plays inspired by Commedia dell’Arte, an Italian form of comic masked theatre. Actors wear masks and play stock characters like the old miser and the mischievous servant. When actors wear masks their performance style becomes larger than life, they use physical theatre and comedy in their work.
At Odyssey we are also interested in international myth and folklore. We find ways of mixing Commedia characters into mythical stories, so we often have two styles of performance: one for mythic characters and one for the Commedia characters who sometimes become commentators on the greater events of the mythic story, giving it a human dimension. We also use masks for mythical characters and we sometimes use puppets in the mythical world if there are magical beasts or ghosts or other supernatural creatures.
Q: Is it true that in this kind of theatre that the audience is invited to imagine more than they can see?
Yes. We take audiences on a journey to distant lands and times, but use simple theatrical means and performance rituals to evoke the spirit of the people and places. Two chairs and a table can be two chairs and a table, but they might become a mountain or a prison cell. If a prince is transformed into a demon, it might happen by a chorus of dancers making the change happen on stage using choreography to create the feeling of magic.
Q: Do you see the influence of Greek Theatre as well as Japanese Theatre (Noh, Kabuki) in Odyssey Theatre?
We have been more strongly influenced by Asian forms of theatre including Peking Opera, Indonesian Wayang Wong, Indian Kathakali and now Sri Lankan Kolam. These influences have come about because we have had the good fortune to meet and collaborate with artists from different traditions to create new work.
Q: How did the Odyssey Theatre where you are the artistic director come about?
I started Odyssey theatre 33 years ago when I moved to Ottawa. There was very little theatre in Ottawa at that time. When I discovered how much work it would be to start a company, I decided to focus our company on a theatre form using masks, because it was something I was fascinated by and I hoped we would make a unique contribution to theatre in Canada.
Q: Tell us about your early experiences with theatre.
I studied theatre at high school and university and I started my career directing comedy and farce. I shifted directions when I began Odyssey. We do a major production each summer in a beautiful park in Ottawa. My memories of my early shows are of many long days and sleepless nights, then astonishment that we drew audiences and somehow survived to start another year.
Q: Having worked on a variety of successful shows over the course of your career, can you tell us who taught you the most valuable lessons along the way?
I studied Commedia dell’Arte with Alberto Fortuzzi from Italy and clown with Philippe Gaulier in France and more Commedia with Ariane Mnouchkine, also in France. These 3 artists had a profound effect on the way I work. One of the principle things I learned fas a director is how to watch actors improvising and see the things they almost express and help them to have confidence in those physical ideas.
Q: What are your impressions of Sri Lankan theatre?
On this trip I will see my first Sri Lankan theatre this weekend, but I have been meeting with artists who are so passionate about theatre, dance and music and they have been so warm, enthusiastic and welcoming. I came to visit Sri Lanka 20 years ago, and at that time saw Kolam theatre in a village near Ambalangoda. I was so impressed with the spectacular masked dance performances and I realized how much drumming contributed to the performance. That experience inspired me to collaborate with artists who work with percussion, dance and theatre.
There will be a presentation and discussion with Laurie Steven, on Commedia dell’Arte on Tuesday, May 8 at 4 pm at Namel Malini Punchi Theatre, Borella. The event is open to all and free of charge.
