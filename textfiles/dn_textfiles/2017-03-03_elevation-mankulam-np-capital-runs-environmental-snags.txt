Elevation of Mankulam as NP capital runs into environmental snags

Environmental concerns have been raised over the Government’s plan to develop Mankulam as the capital city of the Northern Province.
UPFA MP Douglas Devananda said water scarcity and the human elephant conflict in the area could be aggravated due to depletion of forest cover as a result of development of the city. He urged the Government to implement the development plan taking utmost care to minimize the possible environmental damage.
“The area marked to be developed is rich with water resources and also contains a spring. A greater share of water requirement in Vavuniya, Mulathivu and Killinochchi is supplied from this area. The North is already facing an acute water scarcity. Given this situation the planned development activities could cause serious problems when it comes to supplying drinking water and water for agricultural purposes and for animals. The area marked is also frequented by wild elephants and the people living in the area could be vulnerable to elephant attacks” he said.
Megapolis and Western Development Minister Patali Champika Ranawaka said greater attention has been paid to minimize the environmental harm from this planned activity. He said a Strategic Environment Assessment was done to identify the forest reserves, eco-sensitive areas, water conservation areas and areas for town development.
He said the planned project will span till 2030, adding that 12.8 square kilometers (31,000 acres) have been identified for the purpose. Out of this 0.6 square kilometers (1,400 acres) are covered with shrubs.
“Environmental Impact Assessment report is compulsory for the development of this area and for that the approval of the Forest Conservation Department and Wildlife Conservation Department is a must. We have proposed to develop the Mankulam area with least impact on water resources” he explained.
He also said a comprehensive study was done to identify the areas frequented by the wild elephants in the area, adding that the area earmarked does not contain elephant corridors. He said his ministry is only concerned with the plan for the development of Mankulam and that its implementation would be undertaken by relevant public institutions subject to approval of the Northern Provincial Council and other relevant bodies.
