Hong Kong’s ‘Beef Ball’ takes bite out of gender gap

Hong Kong: Hong Kong’s Chan Yuen-ting will smash another hole through football’s glass ceiling when she makes history in the AFC Champions League on Wednesday -- but it couldn’t be a tougher debut for the trailblazing female coach.
Chan, nicknamed “Beef Ball” and just 28 years old, will etch her name in the record books as the first woman worldwide to lead a professional men’s team into continental competition, at the helm of Hong Kong’s Eastern.
The game is not far from Hong Kong, in southern mainland China -- but it is against Guangzhou Evergrande, the mega-rich “Manchester United of Asia” with two Champions League titles and six straight domestic trophies to their name.
But for Chan, who last year became the first female coach to win a top-flight men’s league, it will be an honour to face Evergrande and their World Cup-winning manager, Brazil’s Luiz Felipe Scolari. “I never imagined or expected this could happen but now we’re going to play against him so I feel excited and I’m looking forward to meeting him,” she told the Asian Football Confederation (AFC) website.
“All I need to do is focus on our team and concentrate on the work that we are doing.” Chan’s ground-breaking 2016 Hong Kong title with Eastern made headlines around the globe, and earned her the AFC’s coach of the year award and a place in a BBC list of the world’s 100 most influential women.
Eastern then became Hong Kong’s first club to be handed an automatic berth in the Champions League group stage, thanks to the recent performances of the city’s teams in AFC competitions. AFP
