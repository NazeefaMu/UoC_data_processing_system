Coca - Cola “Gives Back Life”

Coca-Cola Beverages Sri Lanka Ltd recently supported and sponsored the collection and clean-up of PET bottles following the large crowds gathered at the Kataragama Perahera Festival. It was an effective community-driven initiative with the partnership between Coca-Cola, Beira Enviro Solutions Ltd (part of BPPL Holdings) and the Kataragama Committee to collect and recycle PET during and after the Kataragama Festival.
Bottled water, fruit juices and carbonated soft drinks are packaged in 100% recyclable PET plastic bottles, thus making PET the most widely recycled plastic in the world.
Coca-Cola partnered with Beira to “Give Back Life” to these used, empty PET bottles which would otherwise have possibly journeyed to garbage dump sites. Coca-Cola’s principle of extended producer responsibility ensured education, awareness and capacity-building initiatives towards an individual’s responsibility towards responsible disposal and recycling, as well as the importance of community-driven, sustainable initiatives in PET collection, recycling and waste management practices.
The PET clean-up drive not only improved the immediate surroundings but also encouraged festival participants to take individual initiative.
Ensuring an end-to-end approach to the littering issue during the festivities, 1000 litre and 5000 litre bins were placed in easily accessible locations around the venue for the festival participants to responsibly dispose of their PET bottles.
It was a completely hands-on initiative by the organisers with volunteers from Coca-Cola participating on the day to lead the awareness programme in driving recognition of the universal recycling symbol for the PET package – the number ‘1’ inside the arrows arranged in a triangle.
