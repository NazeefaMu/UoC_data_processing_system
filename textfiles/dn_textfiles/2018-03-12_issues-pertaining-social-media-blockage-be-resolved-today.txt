Issues pertaining social media blockage to be resolved today

 
Telecommunications and Digital Infrastructure Minister Harin Fernando said that issues relating the prevailing social media blockage will be resolved today.
The Minister said this at a special media briefing held at the Telecommunication Regulatory Commission, in Colombo today.
The Foreign Affairs Ministry, Home Affairs Ministry, Presidential Secretariat Office and other government institutions have reportedly urged to lift the blockage imposed on social media.
However the Telecommunication Regulatory Commission imposed the social media blockage on March 7, following the communal conflicts which erupted in Teldeniya, Kandy.
