DAMCO optimistic on Lankan logistic sector

Sri Lanka can be converted to a major logistics hub, said DAMCO Logistics (part of the AP Moller/Maersk Group) CEO for India-Middle East and Africa Region, Charles Van der Steene.
In an interview with Daily News he said that Sri Lanka is yet to capitalize on its unique geographical advantage for the logistics sector.
DAMCO is one of the biggest Supply Chain and Logistics Service Providers in the world (Within top 3). “Some of our customers include NIKE, TESCO, Walmart, PVH, Adidas – these brands also use our services in Sri Lanka to source from leading manufacturing chains such as Brandix, MAS, Hidaramani etc.”
He said that the reason they invested on a new warehouse in Sri Lanka for export consolidation operations. “We also see an upward trend in our growth in Sri Lanka and this will continue in the future as well”
He said that globe trade is now moving to Asia and said that both India and China would play a major role in this regard. “This too would boost the logistic sector in Sri Lanka.”
The Warehouse which is located in Ja-Ela, in close proximity to the Katunayake Free Trade Zone will operate as the primary export consolidation center for local Garment manufacturers who supply to Global Brands such as Nike, Walmart, Tesco, Adidas etc. The warehouse has a capacity receive, store and consolidate export cargo up to 2000 Pallet positions at a given time. The footprint of the warehouse is 30,000 square feet, with 8 loading bays.
The warehouse also boasts of a Quality Control Centre and state-of-the-art cargo scanning applications. The warehouse facility is fully compliant with the Global Security and HSSE standards of DAMCO and caters to the specific cargo consolidation requirements of the Global brands, which use DAMCO as their primary logistics service provider.
“The facility underpins DAMCO’s commitment to the Sri Lankan market and a significant investment has been made to ensure that the warehouse facility is aligned with the stringent infrastructure standards which are adopted by DAMCO on a global scale.”
He said that they are upbeat on Sri Lanka and see tremendous potential and will invest more in the island.
“The government too has invested on the sector providing infrastructure and the Customs going paperless for financial transactions was a very good step.”
With the reinstatement of the GSP-Plus trade facility, the Garment exports to the EU Sector are projected to increase exponentially. The opening of this new Consolidation facility allows DAMCO to offer enhanced capacity to the local shippers, whilst playing an integral role in their supply chain.
