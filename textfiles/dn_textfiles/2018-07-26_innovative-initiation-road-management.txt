Innovative initiation for road-management

Our roads are getting dead slow and deadlier by the year. Road trauma, road congestion and road indiscipline have not been adequately addressed by successive governments, highway authorities and the Police over the years.
It is now a herculean task and needs a more dynamic, holistic and an integrated approach by all stakeholders in traffic and highway management to minimize road fatalities, congestion and prevalent road transport conflicts. To execute such an action plan a stronger political will is fundamental and with a higher order commitment by the Police and highway authorities to create a measurable impact on prevalent dangers and hazards in road travel.
Road accidents to a great extent are avoidable and preventable as they are caused by human errors. They could be overcome or prevented by providing a road environment devoid of conflicts or at best minimizing conflicts among users. This is achievable through road engineering features, more importantly backed with dynamic traffic law enforcement strategies.
The enacting of more rigid laws in vogue in other motorized countries such as Driver Improvement Point System (DIPS) will also be effective. The habitual offenders are likely to get their driving licenses revoked or suspended based on infringements committed. This law has had a salutary effect in almost all motorized countries. But this regulation although proposed in the late 1990’s is yet to be implemented needless to say all this at the cost of valuable lives. How many more lives will be lost before such regulations are implemented?
Traffic Law enforcement
It is imperative that traffic law enforcement should receive a higher priority and due diligence of the Sri Lanka Police. Traffic Division of the Police needs to be revamped and restructured to meet challenges at hand perhaps working in three shifts giving adequate coverage both by day and night based on demands in Police divisions.
The present enforcement measurer’s which are in vogue is more of a routine in nature such as static law enforcement at selective locations is totally ineffective, perhaps they cater more for the needs of periodical police inspections. Law Enforcement should be re-modelled with state of the art law enforcement strategies with overt and covert Police operations in a uniform and effective manner, backed by state of the art technology of the present century which are widely in vogue in all motorized countries.
The primary objective of traffic law enforcement is to make road use safer and more efficient. Traffic regulations and penalties only serve as a deterrent for drivers from committing offences towards the overall objective and perhaps to strike a balance between the necessity for mobility and the greater necessity to provide safety in mobility.
Road accidents and traffic congestion today cost the country nearly 2% of the GDP which is a staggering amount. So providing a safe road atmosphere, optimizing the traffic flow and functionality of urban cities must receive a higher status in the policies of the state, police and relevant authorities.
Law Enforcement officers should also be mindful and vigilant to the prevailing road environment and road conflicts which tend some motorists to drive in an inconsiderate or in an impulsive manner disregarding road rules to endanger the movement of traffic and irritate other drivers. They even express their inner feelings with offensive gestures and verbal insults on other users.
This aspect of road behaviour should receive higher order focus and attention of the Police. They should be scrutinized and dealt with driving in an inconsiderate manner so as to endanger other traffic. These offences could be best detected by deploying unmarked police vehicles mingling in traffic, through CCTV cameras or videoing road scenes at random.
There is also an urgent and a pressing need for closer coordination and collaboration using a holistic approach amongst all stakeholders in traffic and highway management to solve this volatile problem. Perhaps forming a Traffic & Transport Authority similar to the Land Transport Authority of Singapore is timely and necessary for a unified and a coordinated action plan.
Role of the insurance industry
Funding for road safety is the primary responsibility of the State; however, insurance companies and allied organisations should be more pro-active in accident prevention as they will be the greatest beneficiaries in the reduction of road accidents. Presently most insurance companies are directing their resources in post-accident follows up whereas they should work hand in hand with law enforcement authorities in accident reduction strategies.
A more pro-active role by the insurance industry is the need of the hour and they will be the greatest beneficiaries in accident reduction.
The culture of road use
Our driving attitudes and the ‘happy go lucky’, uncaring and uncanny road behaviour is an index of our respect for the ‘rule of law’ and our road culture. Roads are high visibility public places where citizens can be judged at their best or worst, therefore fostering discipline on roads should be a key political priority of the government and not an undue priority for state vehicles on roads.
