Experts discuss transformation faces in retail sector

Abheek Singhi -Senior Partner and Director at Boston Consulting Group, stressed that retail sector in order to stay relevant and to successfully face emerging trends in the retail space has to come up with different set of capabilities especially investing money in activities relating to digitization process.
In the future, retail sector will be more digital and much of the growth of the retail sector will be coming from countries in the Eastern world, he told the Sri Lanka Retail Forum 2018 under the theme ‘Towards a Dynamic and Evolving Retail Sector’ in Colombo yesterday.
He also noted that existing retailers will need to reinvest themselves to cater to the diverse requirements of people.
According to him, act of buying commodities will become less of a chore. Players like Amazon and subscription businesses will make this part of retail easier.
Dr. Kumudu Gunasekera- Managing Director, Stax INC speaking at the event said modern consumers are placing a lot more value on experiences over physical items or commodities.
“As many consumers embrace instant messaging apps such as WhatsApp, Facebook and Messenger, we can expect retailers to use these platforms to talk to customers and streamline communication,” he said.
He said majority of Sri Lankan based companies’ revenues come from our 20 million people. Our forefathers haven’t really invested in going out of Sri Lanka. In 10-15 years time, we really hope that 60% of revenues of Sri Lankan companies would come outside Sri Lanka.
Today, data and technology barriers have come down, he said adding that all players in the Sri Lankan retail sector should think hard and take truly Sri Lankan made brands and products to overseas markets.
“That’s the only way Sri Lanka can grow,” he said.
Sandra De Zoysa -Group Chief Customer Officer, Dialog Axiata speaking at the event said Sri Lanka is at a very interesting point as far as retail industry is concerned and local retailers need to come up with innovative initiatives to stay relevant in the market and to offer customers a value added and customer centric products to enrich consumers’ lives.
