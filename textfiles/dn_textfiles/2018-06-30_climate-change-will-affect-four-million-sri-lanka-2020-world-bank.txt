Climate change will affect four million in Sri Lanka by 2020: World Bank

The World Bank issued a special report on Thursday entitled, “South Asia’s Hotspots: The Impact of Temperature and Precipitation Changes on Living Standards,” and warned that 800 million people in South Asia will be seriously affected by climate change by 2050.
“South Asia’s Hotspots” adds to a body of knowledge that has previously looked at the consequences of extreme events—droughts, floods, heat waves, storm surges, and rising sea-levels—and the authors investigated the way that climate change effects South Asians’ living standards.
The survey painted two scenarios for the global future of climate change: one in which collective action is taken to limit greenhouse gases, a “climate-sensitive” scenario, and another in which no action is taken to limit carbon emissions, a “carbon-intensive” scenario. It found that “higher temperatures reduce average living standards in most of South Asia.”
The study examined temperatures on a detailed, spatial level, and concluded that within Sri Lanka, the 3.9 million people living in the country’s northern and northwestern provinces are the most severely at risk to climate impact.
For the first time, the World Bank study linked extensive household surveys with daily temperature fluctuations to offer a glimpse of the worsening standards of living in South Asian hotspots, and found a connection between poorer communities and greater climate impact. Ultimately, the effects of climate change will serve to accentuate poverty and inequality.
The authors repeated a familiar piece of advice: in order to adapt to exceptional climate vulnerability, South Asian countries will have to reduce their emissions of greenhouse gases.
The survey also pointed out that inclusive economic growth will help mitigate the negative effects of climate change.
