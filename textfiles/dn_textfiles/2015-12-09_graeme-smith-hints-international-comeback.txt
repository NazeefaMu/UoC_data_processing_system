Graeme Smith hints at international comeback

DUBAI, Tuesday: Disappointed by South Africa’s meek surrender in the just-concluded Test series against India, retired former captain Graeme Smith said after seeing his ex-teammates struggle so much, he might consider returning to international cricket.
South Africa lost the four-match rubber 0-3, two of those defeats coming inside three days.
Smith, who will be seen in the Masters Champions League (MCL) for the Virgo Super Kings franchise, said seeing the decimation, coming out of retirement has become a serious thought on his mind.
“Who knows the MCL could be a platform back into the international game,” Smith told ‘The National’ newspaper.
“I get asked this question a lot. It does spend time in your head, especially when you see the boys struggling in India you think you can contribute, but we’ll see. I’ll go back train, prepare and get ready for the MCL,” the 34-year-old, who retired last year, said.
