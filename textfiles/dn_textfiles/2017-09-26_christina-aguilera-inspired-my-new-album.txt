Christina Aguilera inspired my new album

Demi Lovato has said she drew inspiration from one of her childhood idols, pop icon Christina Aguilera for her upcoming album, 'Tell Me You Love Me'.
The 25-year-old singer said that it was her 2002 LP, 'Stripped' that transformed Aguilera as an artiste and how she continues to be one of her heroes.
"I grew up listening to Christina Aguilera. She was one of my idols growing up. She still is. Her voice is incredible, and in 'Stripped', you really got to hear that. I think it was her breakout album that really transformed her into the icon that she is today.
"So that inspired me... She really inspired this album. I was even inspired by the black and white artwork!" Lovato said. PTI
