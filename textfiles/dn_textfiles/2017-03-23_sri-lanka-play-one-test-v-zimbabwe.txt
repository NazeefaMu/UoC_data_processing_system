Sri Lanka to play one-off Test v Zimbabwe

Sri Lanka will play Zimbabwe in a one-off Test when the African nation makes a tour here in June at the end of the ICC Champions trophy in England.
In addition to the Test Zimbabwe will also play a series of five One-Day Internationals.
This is the first time that Sri Lanka and Zimbabwe will be playing a one-off Test.
Since the two country’s first began playing Test cricket in 1994 they have always been involved in a series of not less than two Tests.
The last Test series took place in Zimbabwe in November last year where Sri Lanka won 2-0.
Zimbabwe has yet to beat Sri Lanka in a Test match in 17 attempts losing 12 and drawing five.
“We made it a one-off Test at the request of Zimbabwe who wanted to play more one-day internationals instead,” said Sri Lanka Cricket CEO Ashley de Silva.
The original schedule had two Tests and three ODIs, but the revised itinerary has one Test and five ODIs.
Soon after India are due to make a full tour of Sri Lanka playing a series of three Tests, five ODIs and two T20Is. -ST
