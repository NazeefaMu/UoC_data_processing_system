NDB committed to backing women entrepreneurs

NDB recently held its third consecutive workshop on Empowerment of Small Scale Women Entrepreneurs in Matale. The programme was aimed towards empowering women in the area to participate fully in building financial stability.
The objective was to ensure the inclusion of women’s talents, skills and energies in developing sustainable livelihood for their families and communities.
This programme was initiated by the NDB Microfinance Unit and NDB Matale Branch. NDB makes every effort to see mirco level entrepreneurs get to the next level and this was one initiative to help them do so.
Today, women are seen as key contributors in decision making and are actively marking their presence in the entrepreneurial industry.
Microfinance services have become an important tool as they start contributing to the economy by providing support to uplift and encourage especially women. Over the years, many organizations have worked towards empowering women and have seen positive growth in their skills through the support of microfinance in most parts of the country.
Present-day women are recognized as an imperative catalyst in economic rejuvenation, especially in developing countries. Thus NDB takes every effort to provide constant encouragement and propel financial guidance for Sri Lankan women with a determination to grow in their life.
A special guest at this workshop was Srimathi Sandya, Proprietor of Neat Fashion, Kandy, who started off at the micro level. She spoke of her path to success and shared her experiences of being a female entrepreneur.
“As women we must learn how to be determined and not let problems let you down, to be successful in any business one must never compromise on the quality and keep developing what you do” Shalika Priyangani - Micro Finance Officer of NDB, in her presentation, discussed on how to improve knowledge on financial information and financial security. “The problem starts when you don’t know what happens to the money you earn. It is important that you discuss with the Bank on ways to make most of your savings without having to use your capital to pay up loans”
The workshop also included a special discussion by Dr. JayanthaWijesekara – Pediatrician, Matale Base Hospital, on how to secure a good health. The participants were given invaluable health tips and advice on how to avoid Diabetes, High Blood Pressure, High Cholesterol, Heart Disease and about developing good health habits amongst children.
A session on Grooming and Personality was also carried out by Ganga Wanigaratne – Assistant Vice President – Operations, Account Services and Credit Administration.
NDB remains dedicated to bringing its customers one step closer to accomplishing their lifelong ambitions and uplifting their standards of living through the range of services that is accessible through its growing branch network.
