Hookah tobacco haul seized at BIA

About 1,600 packets of hookah tobacco were seized at the Bandaranaike International Airport (BIA) yesterday.
Customs officers at the BIA discovered the haul of illegal tobacco following an examination of a travel bag belonging to a Sri Lankan aged 20, who had arrived at the airport from Dubai.
Customs Deputy Director Sunil Jayaratna said the estimated value of the tobacco is Rs 2.5 million.
“The tobacco seized is Shisha, a flavored item, used for hookah smoking. It is a banned tobacco product with high levels of nicotine and other toxins,” he said.
“The items were found concealed in a bag with a false bottom. The owner of the bag was arrested. The tobacco was confiscated,” Jayaratna said.
