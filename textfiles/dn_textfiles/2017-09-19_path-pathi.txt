Path before Pathi

Dr Dharmasena Pathiraja represents a rare breed of artistes in our country who have the power to bequeath wisdom in people’s minds.
Pathiraja in his cinematic works have exceeded the trend set by Dr Lester James Peries to produce more realistic cinema that had a kind of penetration into deep issues in the society and reality.
Pathi’s cinema was largely inspired by French new wave and Polish and East European films.
He was branded as a left bank (Wam Ivura) filmmaker in the 70s decade since his cinema was focused on urban lower middle-class youth who challenged a capitalist system and yearned for equality among people.
Once he told the Daily News, “My political ideology too was socialist oriented. I was a leftist from my schooling days. While at Dharmaraja College, I used to listen to speeches of Dr N M Perera, Dr Colvin R de Silva and Bernad Soyza with much interest. While in the university, my batch mates used to call me a Trotskyite”.
Although Pathi branded himself as a filmmaker in his heydays as an artiste, he was a resourceful playwright at the inception.
Pathi had studied theatre while in Peradeniya University. He obtained his Master’s degree by writing his thesis on; “Sinhala Naatye Aakruthiya Haa Anthargathaya Athara Aragalaya” (The struggle between form and content in Sinhala theater).
On graduating from Peradeniya University with an Honours degree in Sinhala and Western Classical Culture in 1967, he had lectured on Drama and Performing Arts subsequent to obtaining a PhD in Bengali cinema from the Monash University.
Three books written by Pathi on his plays; Kora Saha Andhaya (The Crippled and the Blind Man), Putu (translation of the play, ‘The Chairs’ by Eugene Ionesco) and Vankagiriya (original script) was launched at the Mahaweli Center, Colombo.
In his original play; Kora Saha Andhaya actors Daya Tennakoon and late Vimal Kumar de Costa had brought in a memorable performance.
This play which had been scripted by Pathi himself and directed by late Dhamma Jagoda decades back was later produced by Janakaraliya with the blessings of the veteran Parakrama Niriella.
Pathi’s direction Putu (The Chairs) had clinched the award for the best translated script at the 1971 State drama festival.
Kapila Kumara Kalinga in his speech said Putu made to the absurd drama genre was not understood by the general audience but Kora Saha Andhaya was a super hit.
“When Pathi shifted to cinema, he induced this absurd genre to his cinema too and Bambaru Awith, Paara Digae and Soldadu Unnehae are good examples. Yet Pathi was branded as a Trotskyite or a Marxist based on his cinema. His latest film too was based on script by Kafka but on the other hand Eugene Ionesco was a hardcore anti-Marxist. This is the irony of Pathi’s creative nature. He believed a filmmaker does not necessarily have to stick to one particular genre to position him. Pathi instead believed in using the most appropriate rhythm to make a particular cinema or drama”, said Kalinga.
Dr Saumya Liyanage made a short but insightful speech on Pathi’s dramas and his contribution to the Sri Lankan theater.
Prof Carlo Fonseka in his keynote speech said, in addition to being a University Don, a dramatist and a filmmaker, Pathi was a resourceful lyricist and a song like ‘Sumudu Sayanae’ is testament to his prowess as a lyricist.
“I see Pathi as a philosopher whose medium was Art. He was very sensitive towards changes taking place in the society”, said the Prof.
He added, “The Exposition, Rising action, The climax, Falling action and Denouement or Resolution being five basic stages aka Five-act-structure of a stage drama is used as the base to develop most plays, way back from Aristotle’s time. Even a Shakespearean drama like ‘Romeo and Juliet’ was built on these five pillars. But Dharmasena Pathiraja’s Kora Saha Andhaya had deviated from this Norm yet magically was able to keep the audience at the edge of their seats.”
The Prof continued to say, “In this original story, Pathi talks of a cripple person and a blind man who come to consensus to seek for greener pastures with mutual help. I tried to understand this drama by putting it in a mould with three aspects; religion, art and science. Buddhist philosophy helped me to understand what was unfolding on stage depicted as Kora Saha Andhaya. People in this world are born with Loba, Dvesha and Moha and these attributes are wrapped in this 32 minute short drama in a magical manner”, said Prof Fonseka.
