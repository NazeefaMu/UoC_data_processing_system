GMOA takes Kiriella to task

What Higher Education and highways Minister Lakshma Kiriella says about the Court of Appeal judgement on SAITM is completely fabricated and the judgment dose not say that SAITM cannot be or should not be closed down. What Minister Kiriella said on behalf of SAITM when he was an opposition MP is now freely available through all social media, Government Medical Officers' Association Secretary Dr.Navin De Zoysa said.
Addressing a press conference at the GMOA head Quarters in Colombo yesterday, he said that the GMOA expects that the current Higher Education Minister will not fall into the low level of the former Higher Education Minister who had been sent home by the people of Sri Lanka. But, unfortunately, he is now in Parliament holding a ministerial position against the wish of the people.
According to Dr.Zoysa, the current Health Minister and the Higher Education Minister should carefully read the 42 page judgement given by the Court Of Appeal on SAITM. In the judgement it very clearly states what the two ministers did not tell the judiciary, the country and what they did not do for the country and the people and how they ignored their official duties. The minimum standard of medical education is Sri Lanka was there from the beginning and under that standard the Sri Lankan doctors won world recognition. But the Health Minister said there was no such standard. Now he has to accept the fact the minimum standard is already there and issue the gazette notification legalizing it. Dr.Zoysa pointed out that the GMOA expect that President Maithripala Sirisena will intervene and solve the SAITM issue before April 7 keeping the promises he made to the people becoming the President and stand by them.
The meaningless and useless talks of ministers is worthless. If not health service, especially the private health services will be halted for a long period of time to make the Government understand / feel the issue through a known / familiar language.
