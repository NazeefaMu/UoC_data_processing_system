Maho tops Grade 5 Scholarship results

Grade five students of the Maho educational zone in the Kurunegala District have succeeded in achieving the first place in the island this year (2017) on the results of Grade Five Scholarship Examination -2017 conducted by the Education Ministry at national level.
But there is still a shortage of 380 school teachers at schools of this educational zone. Maho is one of the remotest educational zones in the NWP.
Even then, the primary school teachers and the respective school heads of Maho educational zone have shown the best results this year in spite of the existing teacher shortage. Even in 2016, the Maho educational zone had succeeded in achieving the best at national level on the results of Grade Five Scholarship Examination-2016.
There is a shortage of 58 primary teachers, 36 Maths teachers, 16 teachers for Buddhism, 19 teachers for Sinhala Language, 63 teachers for English Language, 18 teachers for History, 26 teachers for Science, 20 teachers for Geography, 18 teachers for Civic Education, 36 teachers for Tamil Language, 32 teachers for Arts, 12 teachers for Dancing, 27 teachers for Agriculture and Physical Education at present in these schools. However, there are excess teachers in many urban and leading schools in the Kurunegala town.
“It is unfair to ignore remote schools of the Maho educational zone under these circumstances,” said NWP-PC councilor Bandara Rajapakse, speaking at the recent NWP-PC monthly meeting held at NWP-PC auditorium. On that occasion, NWP-PC Chief Minister Dharmasiri Dassanayke said that as Education Minister and the Chief Minister, he would take steps at the beginning of next year (2018) to recruit a batch of 1,500 graduates for the service of remote schools of the NWP and adequate number of teachers would be appointed to all schools where teachers are mostly needed now, out of those teachers.
