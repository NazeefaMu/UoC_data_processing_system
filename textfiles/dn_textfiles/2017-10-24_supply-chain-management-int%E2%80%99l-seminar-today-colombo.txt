The largest retailer Alibaba does not have any retail shop in the world. The largest media provider, Facebook does not have any contact. Now companies do not hire people instead they outsource and therefore it is our responsible to develop and take supply chain and materials management to the next level in Sri Lanka and across the globe,” Silva urged.
