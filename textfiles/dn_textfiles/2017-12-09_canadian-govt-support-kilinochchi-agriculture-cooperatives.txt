Canadian Govt support for Kilinochchi Agriculture Cooperatives

Canadian High Commisioner to Sri Lanka David McKinnon made an official visit to the Thiruvaiyaru Educated Youth Project of Agriculture Products Consumers Cooperative Society (TEYCS)recentlyin Kilinochchi, where he handed over the "Fruits Collection, Storage, Value Addition, Processing and Sales Centre" to the community.
Political, Economic and Trade Counsellor Jennifer Hart and Kilinochchi District Secretary Sundaram Arumainayaham were present at the handing over of the Cooperative Society Centre, which was supported by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) under the Agro-Economic Development Project (ADP).
Funded by the Government of Canada, the joint UNDP-FAO intervention includes the construction of the facility, renovation of the milling unit, provision of machinery, tools and equipment, technical training on processing and value addition, business development support and facilitating market linkages.
The Cooperative Society was established in 1972 as a means of supporting the local economy in the Killinochchi District in Sri Lanka’s Northern Province. The value addition Centre will now ensure that over 1,240 farmers in Killinochchi District will directly benefit from this intervention, through the sale of crops such as rice, ground nuts and fruits etc.
The ADP is a three-year Project aimed at improving livelihood opportunities of the target communities in the North by supporting value-addition, establishing market linkages and private sector partnerships and creating an enabling environment for socio-economic recovery through the restoration of physical infrastructure and community institutions in the districts of Jaffna, Kilinochchi and Mullaitivu in Sri Lanka.
