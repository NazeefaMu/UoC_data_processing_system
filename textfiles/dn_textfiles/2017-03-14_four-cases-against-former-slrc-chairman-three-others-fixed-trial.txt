Four cases against former SLRC Chairman, three others fixed for trial

Four cases filed against former Sri Lanka Rupavahini Corporation (SLRC) Chairman Prof. Ariyaratne Athugala, its former Additional Director General Devapriya Abeysinghe and G.D. Sugathapala for allegedly threatening and assaulting four SLRC employees in 2010, were yesterday fixed for trial by the Colombo Chief Magistrate.When the four separate cases came up before Chief Magistrate Lal Ranasinghe Bandara, both accused and complainant parties expressed their unwillingness to settle the cases with an apology by the defendants to the complainants.
Four complainants Kanchana Marasinghe, Herbert Kumara Alagiyawanna, Ravi Abeywickrema and Gamini Pushpakumara alleged that they were threatened and assaulted by the suspects when they demanded them to adhere to the Elections Commissioner’s guidelines in line with the Supreme Court order with regard to telecasting of election-related programmes during the 2010 Presidential Election.
The complainants alleged that the former SLRC Chairman abused them in obscene language claiming that the President and he would not care about Supreme Court orders and no one needs to teach him about the media.
Cinnamon Gardens Police took measures to bring these cases before Court since they were not settled at the Mediation Board.
