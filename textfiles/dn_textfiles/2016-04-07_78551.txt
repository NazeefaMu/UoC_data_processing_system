Cricket Australia release Sri Lanka tour itinerary

 
Australia's tour of Sri Lanka has been announced today (April 6) with the three-Test series set to begin on July 26 in Kandy. During their two-month tour starting on July 11, Australia will play five One-Day Internationals (ODIs) and two T20Is in addition to the Test series.
Australia returned to the top of the Test tree after a convincing series victory in New Zealand in February and have yet to lose a Test under new captain Steve Smith. They will enter the series as strong favourites with Sri Lanka enduring a difficult transition since the retirements of legendary batsmen Kumar Sangakkara and Mahela Jayawardene. However, conditions in the sub-continent always pose a serious challenge to Australia although they boast a formidable record in Sri Lanka having lost only one Test there from 13 matches. Sri Lanka's only Test series victory against Australia was a 1-0 series victory in 1999 that was marred by rain.
Australia last played Tests in Sri Lanka five years ago where they won a three-match affair 1-0 in former skipper Michael Clarke's first series as captain. Nathan Lyon, Peter Siddle and Usman Khawaja played in that series but Australia boast few other players with experience in Sri Lanka.
