Getting injured  was a blessing in disguise  -Kaushal Silva

 
For Sri Lanka opener Kaushal Silva getting the webbing of his left hand split proved to be a blessing in disguise as it enabled him to get out of a rut and score a long overdue Test century.
Silva batted six hours to score 115 runs and place his team in a position to push for a rare 3-0 whitewash over the world’s no. 1 ranked Test team Australia.
“My injury required six stitches and the coach asked me whether I could go out and bat. I took the challenge and from that moment I wanted to bat well,” said Silva. “It was a blessing in disguise that I got injured. It prevented me from driving. I had got out a lot trying to drive. I changed a few things by playing on the leg-side.
“It was tough initially as I had a split-webbing. That actually helped me. If you see the first few innings I got out, I was chasing balls wide outside the off-stump. I thought let’s play the balls that are coming to me and let’s focus on that,” he said. “Normally when you have an injury you tend to concentrate more. That helped me a lot and gave me the guts to go out there and show how capable I am and what I can do when the chips are down.”
Silva said he was batting in the nets with a couple of pain killing injections when coach Graham Ford wanted him to go and bat at the fall of the first wicket.
“My fingers and arm were numb. I didn’t feel the bat. Since we lost a wicket early, the coach wanted me to go and bat.
That gave me the confidence and courage,” said Silva.
“Even against spinners I was just punching. When I forced I felt the pain. I didn’t feel anything with the injection. But after the power of the injection went off, I was feeling the pain. Can’t say I batted one handed, but it was really tough.”
Silva rated Tuesday’s innings as his best and added, “It was challenging. It was mainly to prove myself that I can do it. Yes, I had a bad patch, but I had a good tour of England. I just need to get 20 runs or so and I knew once I got there I would go all out.”
Silva said he drew inspiration from his dad who offers him a lot of tips as well as scolds him when he gets out chasing balls wide outside the off stump.
“My dad has always encouraged me. Not to forget my family. It’s good to see that I am now better placed than I was two weeks ago,” said Silva. “The team was amazing. They supported me and the selectors backed me and told me not to worry.
All the innings I was getting out for less than 10. I wanted to score more than 20 because after that I knew how to build up the innings.”
Silva said facing a bowler like Mitchell Starc was “very tough” especially with the new ball. “You have to use the heat advantage. You bat longer and take him into his fourth or fifth spells, that’s what I did today.”
Starc took only one wicket on Tuesday (Kusal Mendis) with the majority of the wickets - five going to the spinners.
“There are rough patches on the pitch and it wasn’t easy and the spinners we have like Rangana (Herath) and Dilruwan (Perera) will have a good effect on this wicket,” said Silva.
we can attack them more and get wickets. We are keen to win this game.”
