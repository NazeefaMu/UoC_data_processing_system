Reaping the benefits of strengthened ties

Some local entrepreneurs said in a media statement that if implemented, the proposed agreement with China will have an adverse impact on the domestic industries, leading to the collapse of a large number of them; if that happens it will result in loss of jobs and livelihoods and inevitable economic chaos. They pointed out that most industrialists were unaware of this grave danger and urged all domestic industrialists to unite and safeguard their industries and businesses.
The proposed FTA between Lanka and China became a serious concern for the local industrialists when the government recently disclosed the requirement and conditions. As local industrialists point out, the potential free entry of Chinese goods, like a tsunami will force domestic industries to closure. It is obvious that the local industrialists have been a solid force in stabilizing the country’s economy throughout the toughest of times.
The sweat and tears they shed over the last few decades built successful local industries and created thousands of employment opportunities within Lanka’s economy. On this basis they strongly oppose the signing of the FTA in the present form. In addition Lanka doesn’t have proper regulation, such as an anti-dumping law to safeguard the local industries. However, all that cannot change the need to connect with large markets in the East. Western giants of global capitalism are in trouble. Yet, people in those countries are agitating for better life, which means better goods with fine finish. We are forced to look elsewhere.
Fight for true freedom
Of course we have the example of Cuba. A small and relatively poor country – Cuba – demonstrated to the entire world that while the western might, sadistic and brutal, it is not omnipotent, and it is possible to defy it. There is no reason why one should not dare, or one should not dream about a much better world, why one shouldn’t fight for true freedom, attempting to win. Cuba inspired the world. Its daring Revolution took place just a few miles from the shores of the United States.
After few years, its teachers and doctors went to all parts of the earth, spreading optimism, solidarity and kindness. Its heroic revolutionaries went to fight against the most dreadful forms of colonialism, which were torturing people, such places as Congo, Angola and Namibia. Later, America changed the face and morals. Obama administration attempted to water down the determination of the Cuban citizens. Of course Cuba did not compromise and sell its Revolution. However Cubans are not living in democracy and pressure on ruling elite has increased many folds. A greatly educated nation, Cubans can see the value of democracy even in the form practiced in America.
President’s state visit to Russia
The Lankan President’s state visit to Russia shows the pragmatic change in the liberal ideology in Lanka. In the past populist politicians expected help in the name of socialism. Now it is clear that there is no socialism anywhere in the world. The 2017 centenary of the Russian revolution, something which the current Russian regime does not want to highlight, was used by the Lankan liberal leaders to highlight the democratic change in Lanka.
The Russian revolution did not deliver socialism, but changed the course of world history. It created the Russian capitalist regime, one of the two super powers that dominate the world today. Twenty five years after the fall of the USSR, Russia is raising its head again; many outside of Russia are still struggling to understand what it wants in the 21st century, or where Vladimir Putin wants to take the bear!
The great political rivalry that is emerging between the American eagle and the Chinese dragon affect Russia. Russian foreign policy recently was dependent on three main factors. These factors included firstly, the relationship with the US; secondly, responding to global economic crises, especially, since 2007 and, thirdly, interest in conflicts in Middle East.
While Putin is projected as a villainous anti-western autocrat, his early self was not antagonistic to the West. He tried to cooperate, clearly announced in the aftermath of 9/11 attacks, the US and Russian interests of fighting terrorism aligned and he called for ‘pragmatic partnerships’ and relations with the western nations. In the meantime China, one of the oldest and greatest civilizations on Earth, went through the terrible period of ‘humiliation’. Divided, occupied and plundered by the West, it has never forgotten nor forgiven.
Now the Chinese ‘Communist state’ and its mixed economy are influencing countries in virtually all parts of the world, from Oceania and Latin America, to the Middle East and especially Africa, to survive and to finally stand on their own feet. Despite all the vitriolic propaganda of the West, China has been gaining respect and trust in virtually all corners of the globe. The Chinese people and their government are now standing strongly against Western globalization. They will not allow any recurrence of the disgraceful and dreary past.
The West is provoking this mighty and optimistic nation, pushing it into a confrontation. Obviously China doesn’t want any military conflict. According to them it is the most peaceful, the most non-confrontational large nation on Earth. But it is becoming clear that if pushed against the wall, it will not compromise: it will fight. Such determination gives hope to many other countries on our planet.
Western plunderers
The message is clear: the West cannot do whatever it wants, anymore. If it tries, it will be stopped. By reason or by force! Russia is ready again, too. It is standing next to China, enormous and indignant. Throughout history, Russia was attacked and ransacked from the West. Millions, tens of millions of its people were murdered, literally exterminated. Like the Chinese people, Russians are unwilling to compromise, anymore. The Old Russian forecast is once again alive!
Go tell all in foreign lands that Russia lives! Those who come to us in peace will be welcome as a guest. But those who come to us sword in hand will die by the sword! On that Russia stands and forever will we stand!
In Russia, as in China, and as in so many other nations that were devastated by the Western plunderers, nothing is forgotten and no one is forgotten. It only appeared for a while that the memory had fainted. It never does. You cannot burn down an entire land, ruin the cities, burn the fields, and still pose as one with the moral mandate. Or as we say now in Lanka: “Justice takes time, but it always comes!” And the world is watching. It is suddenly clearly registering this determined and brave, epic stand of morally strong nations. Many of those who are watching are deeply impressed with what they are seeing.
