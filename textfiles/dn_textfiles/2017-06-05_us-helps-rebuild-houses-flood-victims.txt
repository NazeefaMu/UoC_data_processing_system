US helps rebuild houses of flood victims

The United States Government has extended a donation of Rs. 350 million to assist the programme carried out by the Sri Lankan Government to build houses destroyed by the adverse weather condition.
US Ambassador Atul Keshap handed over this donation to President Maithripala Sirisena yesterday (June 03) at the Presidential Secretariat.
The American government has also shown its interest to provide a grant of Rs.12 million to help improve the technical knowledge of the youth in Sri Lanka. The grant will be staggered for the next four years.
The Ambassador stated that a group of American representatives are engaged in clearing the damaged schools in the Kalutara District. He said those activities will be carried out continuously.
