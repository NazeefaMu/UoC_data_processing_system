Kiwi and his goth girlfriend welcome semi-goth chicks

This adorable love story is truly colorful. 19-year-old Maura T. Hennelly shared the love story of her parrots on Twitter and the internet fell head over heels for the two drastically different lovebirds.
In mid-2017 Maura noticed that Kiwi, the bright, colorful boy lovebird, was getting sad and lonely, so she got him a girlfriend, but the relationship wasn’t successful. Some time passed and Maura got him Siouxsie – a goth girlfriend.
It was love from the first sight for these two lovebirds. Drastically differently colored birds stole the hearts of many and started following their story. Soon Maura shared the news that Siouxsie was about to lay eggs and later that they had four adorable babies. “Remember Kiwi and his goth gf?” Maura wrote on Twitter.
“Well now she’s his goth wife and they have four beautiful half goth babies.” Bored Panda
