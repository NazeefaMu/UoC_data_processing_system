[CITIZENS' Mail - (20-06-2017)]

Tax them heavily
All TV channels in our country heavily depend on advertisers and their advertisements for the survival of business. However, we see that most consumer product advertisements, especially of the multi-national companies are just foreign advertisements dubbed in either Sinhala, English and Tamil. By doing this, the local industry is greatly deprived of the opportunity to come out with innovative and creative productions and the local media teams consisting of artists, production/technical staff, make-up artists and very many personnel directly and indirectly connected are deprived of their share of the media industry.
If all these advertisements are produced within the country without foreign copies being dubbed, a total value addition will be done within the country opening up new avenues and creating new opportunities to local media industry.
In view of the above, and at a time the Finance Minister is looking for every opportunity to collect additional revenue, I suggest that heavy taxes/levies be imposed to advertise foreign advertisements in the media.
