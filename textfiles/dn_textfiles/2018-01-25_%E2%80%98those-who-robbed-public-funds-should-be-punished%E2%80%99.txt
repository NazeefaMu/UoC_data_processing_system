‘Those who robbed public funds should be punished’

Special Assignments Minister Dr Sarath Amunugama said at Wettawa, Galagedara, that individuals who robbed public funds without any shame should be given the maximum punishment without regard to their status.
Addressing a local government election rally the Minister said: “Those who have robbed people’s money should be severely punished irrespective of their position. Some people who have robbed public property and public funds without any shame have now attached the ‘patriot’ label to themselves and surrounded by their henchmen are trying to shine in all their glory. Therefore public opinion, the demand of the people, is that those who robbed the people’s money the public funds, should be punished. The President is now engaged in punishing those who robbed government funds through the bond scam and in recovering that money. In the same way action will be taken to bring the other robbers also to justice before long.
“Theft, fraud and corruption will not reign in a country, if the law functions properly. Therefore, it is the duty and responsibility of those who govern, to ensure that the rule of law prevails. People can be protected and the security of the country ensured only if the law functions properly. Therefore, we should seek to implement the law to the letter. If a country’s governance is allowed to be overwhelmed by theft, thuggery, and bribery, there is no future for that country nor security for its people. That is the reason for the decline of some African countries. The people of our country are mild and beautiful. That beauty should not be allowed to be dirtied by the sinful hands of politicians.”
