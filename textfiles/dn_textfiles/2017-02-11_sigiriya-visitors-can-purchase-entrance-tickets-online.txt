Sigiriya visitors can purchase entrance tickets online

Local and foreign tourists can purchase entrance tickets online to visit Sigiriya from the Central Cultural Fund (CCF) from today, Education Minister Akila Viraj Kariyawasam said.
“Foreign tourists will especially benefit by this move as they are able to purchase entrance tickets in their countries prior to visiting Sri Lanka. The validity period of tickets, bought through the internet will be three months,”  Minister Kariyawasam said. Online booking is a more convenient way for tourists to purchase tickets, thus helping them save valuable time,”the minister said.
In line with this ticket issuing process, a new ticket counter established by the Central Cultural Fund at Sigiriya will be commissioned by Minister Kariyawasam today.
