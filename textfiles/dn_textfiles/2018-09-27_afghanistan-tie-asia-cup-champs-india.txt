Give further demonstration of their fast rise in world cricket
Afghanistan tie with Asia Cup champs India

DUBAI, Tuesday – Afghanistan further demonstrated their fast rise as a one-day cricketing nation when they ended their Asia Cup campaign with a thrilling tie against defending champions India in their final Super Four match played at the Dubai International Cricket Stadium here Tuesday.
The game was nicely set up by opener Mohammad Shahzad’s blazing 124 followed by Mohammad Nabi’s all round performance (64 and 2/40) as Afghanistan fought till the end to deny India a win which at one stage they looked like achieving following an opening stand of 110 between Lokesh Rahul (60) and Ambati Rayudu (57).
Chasing 253 for victory India required seven runs off the final over and Afghanistan one wicket. With Ravindra Jadeja at the crease the odds were heavily on India securing the win. But after the scores were tied off the fourth ball Jadeja mistimed a drive off the fifth ball bowled by Rashid Khan and the catch was held by Zadran at midwicket for the match to end in a tie.
Afghanistan players celebrated as if they had won the match while India were left shell-shocked on how they were deprived of victory. It was a game they should have pulled off but couldn’t thanks to some gritty display on the field by Afghanistan who never gave up trying.
Afghanistan’s captain Asgar Afghan said: “It is really a proud moment for me and my team, because we have played super cricket in this Asia Cup, winning the first two games in the first round and then qualifying for the Super 4. Here we finished two close games and we were unlucky we couldn’t finish with a win in the last two matches. But the way we have finished today I think I am feeling proud and the credit goes to the players for the way they have played in the entire tournament. It shows the consistency and commitment of our performance that we have shown in this tournament.
I am very happy and satisfied, it is also an important moment in history for Afghanistan because we have never played like this in the Asia Cup before. We were unlucky not to qualify for the final, but we hope we will do that next time.”
Afghanistan’s total of 252-8 was earlier set up by Shahzad the stocky Afghan opener who had never scored an ODI century against an established Test side, but yesterday he put that record straight with a blistering innings of 124 off 116 balls.
Coming to this game Shehzad had four ODI hundreds but against lesser strong opponents – Netherlands, Canada, Scotland and Zimbabwe but yesterday was a special day where he showcased his talent with aplomb to take Afghanistan to a total of 252 for eight wickets against an India side that was sans many of its stars who were rested for this game as they have already qualified for the final.
The Afghan innings was entirely dominated by Shahzad whose batting resembled that of a modern day Duleep Mendis, the former Sri Lanka captain - stocky with powerful arms to execute sixes with panache.Shahzad gave one chance at 49 when Rayudu failed to hold the catch offered at mid-off off Kaul that saw him reach his half century off 37 balls. Then at 93 he won a review after he was given out caught behind off Khaleel when replays showed the ball coming off his shoulder.
Nothing could deprive Shahzad from reaching his century which he did with a flick of his wrists to find the fine leg boundary for his tenth four in addition to hitting six sixes off the 88 balls he faced.
When he finally holed out to long-off Shahzad had scored 124 out of his team’s score of 180 and his innings comprised 11 fours and seven sixes. Shahzad dominated an opening stand of 65 with Javed Ahmadi whose contribution was a mere five runs off 30 balls, after Afghanistan had won the toss and decided to bat first.
But once India broke through with Ravindra Jadeja having Ahmadi stumped by MS Dhoni the Afghanistan innings caved in as they lost four wickets for 17 runs. Jadeja and leg-spinner Kuldeep Yadav caused the slide by picking up two wickets apiece as Afghanistan slumped from 65-0 to 82-4.
However a 50-run stand between Shahzad and Gulbadin Naib (15) lifted them to 132 before Naib was dismissed by debutant fast bowler Deepak Chahar giving him his maiden ODI wicket. A further stand of 48 followed between Shahzad and Mohammad Nabi before the former’s dismissal. But Afghanistan’s batting did not cave in and with Nabi scoring a rapid 64 off 56 balls (3 fours, 4 sixes) they batted out the 50 overs to set India with a challenging total against their three-prong spin attack.
Afghanistan has been the most consistent team in the tournament with totals in excess of 250 in all their matches except against Sri Lanka when they scored 249.
India decided to test their bench strength by resting key players skipper Rohit Sharma, Shikhar Dhawan, Bhuvneshwar Kumar, Jasprit Bumrah and Yuzvendera Chahal and giving a debut cap to 26-year-old right-arm medium-pacer Deepak Chahar.
Former captain Dhoni took over the captaincy to lead his country in a record 200 ODI’s.
