ICRA Lanka has revised long term ratings of Pan Asia Bank

ICRA Lanka Limited, subsidiary of ICRA Limited, a group company of Moody’s Investors Service, has revised the issuer rating of Pan Asia Banking Corporation PLC (PABC or “the Bank”) to [SL]BBB- (pronounced S L triple B minus) with Negative outlook from [SL]BBB (pronounced S L triple B) with Negative outlook.
ICRA Lanka has also revised the issue rating to [SL] BB+ (pronounced S L double B plus) with Negative outlook from [SL]BBB- (pronounced S L triple B minus) with Negative outlook for the bank’s subordinated unsecured redeemable listed debenture programme of Rs 3,000 Mn.
The revision of the ratings and continuation of the negative outlook factor in the expected pressure on the profitability profile of the bank due to deteriorating asset quality and escalating interest cost which may hinder the internal generation to achieve the minimum capital requirement of Rs 10,000 Mn by January 1, 2018 set by the Central Bank of Sri Lanka.
The ratings take cognizance of the impact on bank’s performance following the suspension of Primary Dealer License based on an investigation carried out by CBSL.
