 Well-known trainers Sanjeev Jayaratnam and Kumar de Silva have teamed up once again to host yet another of their popular Motivational, Skills Development, and Corporate Etiquette workshops, on May 31 at the Galadari Hotel in Colombo.
In a specially crafted full-day session titled ‘The Smart Professional’, these two well-known personalities in their respective fields, share dos and donts, tips and secrets on how they maintain professionalism at all times while constantly being in the public eye.
“Communication is not verbal only but rather about projecting a totally professional image at all times. Participants will learn key aspects which contribute to how they look, communicate with others, how they behave in society, how their personality comes across to others. A totally interactive and hands-on session of dining protocol, forms an interesting segment of the sessions along with the rest of the content, which is totally focused on giving practical steps one can follow to become the Smart Professional one aspires to be”, say the duo.

First impressions count; How to switch on confidence, energy and enthusiasm within a few seconds; Cocktail protocol, Wining and Dining - sit down banquet style and buffet, Communicate with maximum impact - verbal, para-verbal and non-verbal so that people listen and are convinced; and, Personal hygiene and grooming.
