Meritocracy inalienable from good governance

A leading newspaper which is 100-years-old, quotes in today’s (March 13, pg 5) newspaper a Minister to say that “Scientific Cabinet reshuffle after President returns”. During the recent past the topics of much interest, discussion and debate have been on Constitutional amendments, National / Unity Government, Electoral Reforms, investigations on abuse, bribery and corruption, Cost of Living and Local and National elections. Many an article have been written and published along with media conferences with very little outcome!
However, on the presumption that all these have been dealt with or attempted to have been dealt satisfactorily or otherwise being resolved, much thought has to be given to what happens with the so called “Cabinet Reshuffles”. Respective election manifestos have been debated, publicized and popularized with loads of promises and good intentions. How much of these become realities with the cooperation of “nation loving citizens” more than with those with one’s own self interests would be a good guess!
A wish of the entire majority in this country comprising of the honest citizens would be that there would truly be “Good Governance” in the country. This concept is not a prerogative of one political party or a group of them, as it has been in existence for quite some time and practised for better or worse.
At a time when the future is not known, predictions being made, which political party (ies) would predominate, who should be the President, the Prime Minister, Leader of the Opposition etc, it is time to open public debate on how “Good Governance” could be maintained. The election manifestos would have to, not only include same but also indicate how such would be implemented. There are many publications, theories, regulations on Good Governance, they will not produce the desired results if those responsible for such implementation are not appointed appropriately and obtain maximum possible cooperation from all parties represented in the Parliament.
Merit worthy qualities
It is of paramount importance that “Good Governance” should be operative from both top and bottom, at all levels and from all sides. Selections to important positions should not be on political bias, influence family connections and friendships but should be done appropriately purely on their own merit.
It is this aspect of “MERITOCRACY” I wish to highlight as the main ingredient for “Good Governance”, which ever political party, alliance or peramuna dominate. Merit is quite rightly often rated high for spiritual merit, thereafter for academic and professional. While this is correct, the last para of this article would also refer to other aspects of Merit relevant to Good Governance. In the appointment of Heads of Institutions in the Public Sector, Chief Executive Officers, Advisors, Commission/Council/Board members the keyword and criterion should be MERITOCRACY ie in simple words those possessing merit worthy qualities and those with (i) a proven track record on the subject, (ii) current involvement in the subject and (iii) a good vision, based on merit alone, irrespective of race, caste, creed, friendship, relationship, wealth/generosity, old school/campus ties etc.
As an apolitical citizen though many an article was written and published conveying views on Electoral Reforms under different themes, only a fraction of same would have been considered and implemented so far. We often hear the President, Prime Minister, Cabinet Ministers, recognised Political Party Leaders, inviting professionals to interact with Statesmen and politicians in decision making, it gave me at least some courage to write an article once again and sincerely hope that suggestions may be considered.
The general public at the outset should accept as history has shown that the country needs both Statesmen and politicians. The consideration of such would depend on President and Prime Minister in the formation of an effective reasonably sized Cabinet of Ministers.
With all due respect to President and Prime Minister, they may require some honest, competent apolitical advisers to suggest the composition. Also the views of the MPs in Parliament could be sought through a secret ballot by the President and the Prime Minister to identify the suitable persons irrespective of “Party Politics”.
The decisions may not result in 225 happy Members of Parliament and there would also be a few thousand loyalists also discontent but there would be a few millions quite content if correct decisions are taken. The first challenge would be to have a reasonably sized Cabinet of Ministers of about 25 MPs given the portfolios while undoubtedly a large amount would be disappointed unless they have the consolation of deputy ministries. Such a downsized Cabinet of Ministers from the general public’s view point would not be just economic cost cutting, but from the point of view of “Good Governance” it will be effective coordination and output oriented.
Lack of coordination
At the moment lack of coordination of allied Ministries have cause conflict and retarded progress. If the reduction in emoluments and benefits could aggrieve some by losing their portfolios, such could be compensated to the deserving ones, either by increasing the emoluments to the deputy Ministers from the net savings of the down sized Cabinet provided the net result is definitely “Good Governance”. Some deserving Seniors may be even appointed as “Senior Ministers” without portfolios but to oversee a group of Ministries.
These divisions are very similar to those prevailing in neighbouring India, the S.A. regional countries and in many other countries in the developed world.
However, in the event through the provisions of the 19th Amendment for a National Government, the number of Ministries may not be critical, but for effectiveness of coordination of the subject areas under each portfolio listed, it would be most essential to have at least a competent person in the rank of an experienced Minister to coordinate each of the main subjects.

Meritocracy has deep meaning in more than one way as “eye openers” when a current candidate has openly expressed that individuals are now seen better through these elections. Perhaps they are seen as Statesmen, politicians or opportunists and it is here that the voters too will have to have their eyes fully open as they vote in the future. In this connection during the Presidency of Elmore Perera, at the Organization of Professional Associations (OPA) about a decade ago, in 2008 a team of which I was a member, deliberated on a rational and scientific basis and a proposal for a 25 member Cabinet of Ministers was formulated, which has been subsequently deliberated at the National Movement for Social Justice.
As a finality on the activity of a Cabinet which would display its effectivity through MERITOCRACY where the main objectivity should be honesty and integrity, coupled with humility, creativity and credibility, in order to have validity, productivity and prosperity to the country, without the citizens facing undue austerity, should be the reality of such an entity and these facts are placed for posterity.
