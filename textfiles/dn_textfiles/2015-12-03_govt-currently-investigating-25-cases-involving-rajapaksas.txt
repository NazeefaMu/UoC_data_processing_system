'Govt currently investigating 25 cases involving Rajapaksas'

Foreign Affairs Minister Mangala Samaraweera told Parliament yesterday, that the present government was following an unwavering foreign policy which could take the government on the correct path by maintaining friendly relationships with all countries.
He made this observation joining the second reading debate on the Budget Proposals 2016 for the 9th allotted day.
"Now we are equally friendly with both China and the US, Russia the EU and India and Pakistan. The country's foreign policy is moving forward on the right track," the Minister said.
Minister Samaraweera also said that within the 100 days programme, the present government could be able to fulfill the requirements of the people that had not been fulfilled by the previous regime for the past ten years.
The world has now accepted that Sri Lanka at present has two leaders who could work as Nelson Mandela and Lee Kuan Yew did. President Maithripala Sirisena is creating a more democratic society, while the Prime Minister is taking measures to strengthen the country's economy.
Budget 2016 had laid a strong foundation to the speedy development.
He also said that people of this country expects speedy action regarding the financial fraud and corruptions that had taken place during the previous regime.
"Even a member of the Rajapaksa family is behind the all crimes and corruptions and investigations are currently going on with regard to the 25 cases directly involving by the Rajapaksas. Investigations would have to be conducted in six countries concerning a single case. Investigations have been delayed due to limited human resources," the Minister said.
Foreign Minister Mangala Samaraweera brought in some photographs of former President Mahinda Rajapaksa to the Chamber yesterday as evidence to prove his allegation that the previous regime had secret deals with the LTTE and the Tamil Diaspora.
Exhibiting the photographs during his speech, he said that he would wish to give the photographs to his friend in the opposition MP Dinesh Gunawardena.
"I have heard that Dinesh Gunawardena has a Rajapaksa shrine in his home, where he worships Rajapaksa's pictures. So Dinesh can take these too and hang them up in that shrine," the Minister said.
He also showed a picture of the former President with a group of expatriates and who were senior leaders of the Tamil diaspora.
"Look at this photograph taken on December 17, 2014. The person next to President Rajapaksa is Dharmalingam Yogeswaran. I have another picture of Rajapaksa hugging KP," the minister said.
Minister Samaraweera also tabled printouts of online news stories alleging that former Defence Secretary Gotabhaya Rajapaksa had met with the members of the Tamil Diaspora.
He also alleged that they had met all the members of the Tamil Diaspora in secret, while now finding fault with us when we try to usher in peace.
