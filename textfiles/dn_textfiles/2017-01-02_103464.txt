ISM APAC conducts CSR project

ISM APAC, one of the leading E commerce agencies in Sri Lanka, recently launched a Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) project in Kabithigollewa, aimed at providing an advanced water purifying filter for schoolchildren studying at Kahatagahagollawa Vidyalaya.

ISM APAC believes that a child’s education is the only sustainable reward that can be passed on to future generations.
A Chronic kidney disease (CKD) has become a major health problem in rural areas in Sri Lanka, which was previously confined to North Central and Uva Provinces. ISM APAC as a socially responsible company decided to focus on the matter with their annual Corporate Social Responsibility project for 2016.
They have contributed to the affected area with the best of their ability and worked tirelessly throughout the year to make this project a success.
Kahatagahagollawa Vidyalaya is providing education for 180 students in the area with classes starting from grade 1 to grade 11. The school and the village are vastly affected with the CKD in recent years and many children have already lost their parents as well.
ISM APAC has taken necessary steps to fix an advanced water purifying filter (customized based on the quality of the water in the selected area) at the school, which will not only benefit the school but also the villagers.
The advanced water purifying filter was handed over to the school recently by ISM APAC. The specialty about the water filter system is that the filter will provide 800 gallons of drinking water per day, covering the need of both students and villagers.
The filter system will include a softer system as well as to treat the heavy water of the area while the main filter will be treating the other dissolved solids. All project cost are borne by ISM APAC and will include the support of the school for first year maintenance in addition to the implementation of the filter system.
ISM APAC is looking forward to undertake more projects in the near future to contribute to the society as a socially responsible organization. (DJ)
