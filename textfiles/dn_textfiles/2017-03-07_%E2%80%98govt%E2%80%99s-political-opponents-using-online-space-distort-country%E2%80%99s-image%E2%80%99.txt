‘Govt’s political opponents using online space to distort country’s image’

Hitting out strongly at fake news, President Maithripala Sirisena said the government’s political opponents were misusing the cyber space to paint a wrong picture about Sri Lanka.
“Sri Lankans living overseas are particularly vulnerable to such fake news campaigns,” the President said, speaking to the Sri Lankan community in Jakarta, the capital city of Indonesia, last evening.
The President, addressing the meeting which took place three hours after his arrival in Jakarta, urged the Sri Lankan expatriates not to fall victim to fake news on web and social media platforms.
President Sirisena said the new government’s rise to power had created a shift in the international community’s viewpoints on Sri Lanka.
“My visit to Jakarta is the first after former Prime Minister Sirimavo Bandaranaike’s visit to Indonesia in 1976. I will also be the first Sri Lankan Head of State to pay a state visit to Russia in four decades,”
the President said, just weeks away from his visit to Russia on an invitation by his Russian counterpart Vladmir Putin.
These visits, the President said, underscore the fact that Sri Lanka has received more recognition and acceptance from the international community as a result of the new government’s reforms programme.
“We have brought back democracy to Sri Lanka. The draconian 18th Amendment was replaced with the 19th Amendment which ensured the establishment of independent commissions. We will continue to on the path of democratic political reforms,” the President explained. He also planted a ‘na’ sapling at the Sri Lankan embassy premises in Jakarta to mark the beginning of his visit.
