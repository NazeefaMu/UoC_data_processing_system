World Environment Day -‘Connecting People to Nature’

The World Environment Day is celebrated around the globe today, (05) under the theme ‘Connecting People to Nature’. This year’s theme implores people to get outdoors and into nature, to appreciate its beauty and to think about how we are part of nature and how intimately we depend on it, says the United Nations World Environment Day programme. Canada hosts the World Environment Day official celebrations this year.
On December 15,1972, the United Nations’ General Assembly adopted a resolution designating June 5 as World Environment Day and urging all governments and organisations in the United Nations system to undertake on that day every year, world-wide activities reaffirming their concern for the preservation and enhancement of the environment, with a view to deepening environmental awareness and pursuing the determination expressed at the Conference. United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP), the specialized agency on environmental issues, was formed on the same day.
