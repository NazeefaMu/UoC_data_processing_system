Hyundai Lanka Foundation donates  first collection to SOS children’s villages

With a strong focus on enabling the people of Sri Lanka to achieve their fullest potential through holistic social and entrepreneurial development, Hyundai Lanka Foundation, the CSR arm established by Hyundai Lanka (Pvt). Ltd, donated its maiden collection to the SOS Children’s Villages Sri Lanka recently.
Launched for the season in December 2017, The Hyundai Lanka Foundation allocated Rs. 10,000 for every Hyundai vehicle sold. As a first initiative, The Hyundai Lanka Foundation joined hands with the SOS Children’s Villages Sri Lanka to support the villages and provide a loving home for every child.
The maiden collection, consisting of Rs 1.4 million, was donated by the Hyundai Lanka Foundation and will be utilised for the improvements of the SOS Children’s Villages across the island. In the meantime, The Hyundai Lanka Foundation will continue to support the SOS Children’s Villages by fuelling hope to enable every child to pursue their big dreams and become successful in their future endeavors.
Commenting on the initiative, Julian Reuter, Director of Hyundai Lanka Pvt. Ltd said “With this contribution, we aim to nurture the lives of children in the SOS Villages around the country by empowering them to achieve their full potential and become future entrepreneurs who will add value to the local professional landscape. With a strong vision to create a prosperous nation, we are also on the lookout for possible partnerships with forward thinking non-governmental organisations to drive our CSR vision and we are certain that the foundation will occupy a strong foothold and will assist the country’s most pressing issues in the long term.”
Hyundai Lanka (Pvt) Ltd represents the Hyundai Brand of Motor Vehicles in Sri Lanka.
