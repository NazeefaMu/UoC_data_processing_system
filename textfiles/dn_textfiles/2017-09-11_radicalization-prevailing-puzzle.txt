Radicalization; a prevailing puzzle

On a random day in January 2015, Mohamed Muhsin Sharhaz Nilam, 37, of Galewala, packed his bags, and with his family of wife and six children in tow, left his quiet life as a principal of an international school to join the most violent terrorist organization in the world today. His mission: to fight alongside ISIS to create an Islamic Caliphate in the region. He was killed in an air strike on 12 July 2015.
Since then, the former Secretary Defence Karunasena Hettiarachchi as well as the former Minister of Justice Wijeyadasa Rajapaksha has stated that around 36 Sri Lankans have left the island nation to join ISIS. Minister Rajapaksha explained these individuals came from educated backgrounds.
The reason as to why these individuals, far from the conflict of Syria would leave their comfortable lives to fight for a cause alien to them, however remains a mystery.
Two years later, former Canadian Intelligence Officer Phil Gurski addressing a room full of defence personnel interested in knowing the root causes of such ‘radicalization’ said, “There is no formula for why someone would radicalize.”
The Defence establishment in this year’s Colombo Defence Seminar held chose to look at one of the most important security threats the world has in common; ‘Countering Violent Extremism’.
The present CEO and President of Borealis Threat and Risk Consulting Ltd had been invited to speak on the definition and root causes of radicalization and yet to a surprised room, he announced that it was ‘highly impossible to come up with a generalized and universal template’ as there was too much variability when one needs to define or identify why a rational person would take to arms.
Radicalization in its essence is not a problem he continued. “Some of the greatest progresses came from radical people,” he added but a problem arises when that ‘radicalization’ is imposed on others with violent means.
“A person who radicalizes, says, there is something wrong here, I know who is behind it and I need to use violence to make it right,” explained Gurski further.
You bring enough people who think this way, and you have a terrorist outfit.
“The essence of terrorism is a group of people who think they have a grievance, they think they there is an injustice, they know who is responsible—either it is the state or ‘those people’. And the only way to get justice is to use violence,” said Gurski.
This definition alone however does not answer the question of which persons exactly will take to arms or ‘radicalize’ to the detriment of others. The usual root causes of; poverty, lack of education, lack of opportunity, isolation and even mental illness (long ruled out), is too ‘simplistic’ said Gurski. In addition, the theory that only ‘failed states’ or ‘ungoverned spaces’ tend to produce terrorists does not answer as to why even developed countries like Canada or the USA too have their own home grown terrorists.
“Each element, each driving force proposed is neither necessary nor sufficient to cause terrorism,” said Gurski.
“Each person’s individual process to violent radicalization is individual,” he added as he explained that in his long career as an intelligence officer, there were men and women who were both, rich and poor, educated and uneducated, loners as well as with family—all from varied backgrounds but they had all chosen to radicalize for one purpose or the other.
Thus he asked that experts not confuse the ‘important distinction of correlation and causation’ when designing policies to root out terrorists.
“When mapping, we need to consider local and individual differences and if you generalize, you will end up with bad policies that will not address the issue,” said Gurski.
In the local context, Gurski explained that a Canadian study done on the motivation of young men in the North to join the LTTE showed that “becoming a violent terrorist was a rational decision made from their perspective. They were not brainwashed. The cause for joining the movement according them was for a certain search for significance in their lives.”
Gurski however pointed out that such conclusions were problematic; “All want to be significant and want meaning in their lives—all humans have that, which would mean that all could potentially be a terrorist given the right condition,” he pointed out.
Gurski also went onto dismiss theories of ‘self-radicalization.’ He said, in his career he has never seen any case of ‘self-radicalization.’
“It is a human-to-human process. We are social animals, we talk to people, in life or online. You have to get input from somebody else, you have questions and doubts and they get solved for you by somebody,” he said.
This has been the case for those like Nilam who is known to have studied in Pakistan and visited Saudi Arabia a couple of times. His own brother, Mohamed Aroos, had been working in Syria for four years and has also been suspected to be part of ISIS, though it is yet to be confirmed.
Sri Lankan Muslim identity in flu
According to an article written by Balasubramaniyan Viswanathan in Geopolitics Monitor; an International Intelligence Publication based in Canada, external influences as well as ‘deep schisms among various sub-groups within the Sri Lankan Muslim community’ which not only posed questions on the Muslim identity in Sri Lanka, but also of its ideology may have created a ‘perfect ecosystem for radicalization of youngsters.’ “According to a recent study commissioned by the International Centre for Ethnic Studies in Sri Lanka, entitled ‘Fracturing Community—Intra-group relations among the Muslims of Sri Lanka,’ factionalism among the Muslims is driven by both material gains as well as the desire to protect their own version of Islam,” Viswanathan explained in his article.
“Traditional Islamist movements like Sufism are in direct conflict with reformist movements like Jamaat e Islami and Thablighi Jamaat. In Sri Lanka, it appears that Pakistan based Jamaat e Islami and India based Thablighi Jamaat have toned down their ideology for formation of hard line Islamic State and have focused on local issues while preaching purification of Islamic practices. However, this conflict soon aggravated when Saudi Arabia-based movements like the Thawheed Jamaat jumped into the fray. Thawheed Jamaat preached Wahabism, a more radical form of Islam propagated by Abdul Wahab which in turn created a conflict between two primary schools of thought—Wahabism and Sufism in Sri Lanka.
Though the ICES study concludes from interviews with interlocutors of various groups like Thawheed, Thablighi, and Sufi, that there are no Islamic jihadist groups operating in Sri Lanka at this moment, it does concede that “while there is talk among discontented youth about espousing jihadi practices, these are just idle youth responding to the global trend in Islam, but with no motivation or the means to make this a reality,” he added.
And this misinterpretation of religion leading to violence, has been termed as a mixture of the ‘religious’ and ‘radical wave’ of terrorism in the 21st century by Prof Lailufar Yasmin of the Department of International Relations at the University of Dhaka.
Prof. Yasmin, also addressing the Colombo Defence Seminar, explained that when countering violent extremism, one needed to look at the religious wave and radical wave together.
“It is where I do not only kill to please God, but I murder anyone who does not believe in my ideology; my kind of Islam. Here, we also have distorted Quranic messages coming in,” she said.
Countering violent extremism
Citing an example from Bangladesh, she explained that in Janurary, 2016, they found that changed Quranic verses were being presented to youth to motivate them to carry out violence. She further explained that such threats cannot be fought by the security sector alone but it needed to be looked at from the ‘macro, micro and meso levels’.
At the micro level, the individual is important, “Each terrorist narrative is different: the role of the imam, educational institution, etc. needs to be looked into,” said the Professor. At the meso level, the trend of religious conservatism or radicalism in society in general needs to be studied, she explained further. “Action needs to be taken at the tertiary level, after they are radicalized; secondary, when they are showing symptoms and primary, even before they are radicalized, to identify those who are at risk,” said Prof. Yasmin.
This system was adopted in Indonesia which has been working on countering violent extremism since the Bali bombings in 2002. As explained by Prof. Yasmin, they had programmes in prison to build trust between police and prison officials with terrorists in custody to either de-radicalize them or to find out more information on their outfits. These programmes also seek to manage ‘violent extremism in prison environments and develop the role of frontline prison staff in countering violent extremism.’
The lead national counter-terrorism agency in Indonesia, Badan Nasional Penanggulangan Terrorisme (BNPT), was established in 2010 to coordinate all stakeholders involved in countering violent extremism. But managing the diverse views within Indonesia has been difficult and bringing all state agencies onto the same page has been an obstacle.
Prof. Yasmin, however, pointed out that civil society groups have been more successful in their efforts and programmes such as having former militants and victims speak at forums has had some success.
Inter-faith debate, use of social media; though follow up with personal face-to-face contact is crucial, are some of the other activities taken up by the relevant stakeholders to prevent youth radicalizing.
National education policy
Another perspective promoted by Sabariah Binte Mohamed Hussin, Research Analyst at the International Centre for Political Violence and Terrorism Research at the S. Rajarathnam School of International Studies in Singapore, was to promote a national education policy where all linguistic and ethnic groups would study together from kindergarten until they complete their tertiary education in order to build a common national identity. Speaking from the Singapore example, she explained that if diverse communities go to school in their own linguistic and religious denominations, then a nation would never be united. “No multi religious/ethnic society can sustain security and stability if they grow up in silos and don’t assimilate and integrate in creating the nation state,” said Hussin.
Communities in isolation, she said, will bound to create prejudice, suspicion and violence unless there assimilation of the communities at some point. The importance of having all communities study all religions was also highlighted here.
“Such policies in national education requires leadership and political will,” she said and added that the need to inculcate ‘national consciousness and patriotism’ was vital for security and nation building.
“Exclusiveness will not only lead to ethnic differences but also to violent extremism. In Singapore, no community insisted that its language and race be above others—it has to be neutral and secular so all can feel at home,” she said.
Singapore also practices policies where housing, common spaces and other amenities are designed to have all ethnic communities live together, side by side. The national service made mandatory to all male Singaporeans is also thought to build cohesiveness among all Singaporean men.
The country, Hussin pointed out also practiced, the policy of ‘Total Defence’ where all citizens play their part to keep an eye out for extremist behavior and do their part to keep the country secure. Sri Lanka, with its multi-lingual and multi-ethnic communities, however, has been more than happy over the years to live in silos rather than integrate. The isolation felt by one led to a three decade war. As the threat of radicalism spreads across the world, Gurski pointed out that the best way to counter violent extremism was through dialogue, but he pointed out, “As intelligence services, we don’t do a great job in participating in the dialogue.”
