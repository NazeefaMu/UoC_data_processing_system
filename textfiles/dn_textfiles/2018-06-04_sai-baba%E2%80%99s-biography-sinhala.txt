Sathya Sri Sai Baba was a great teacher who lived in Madya Pradesh, India in the 18th century.
He never preached any religion. His ideas were simple and ordinary. He never believed in any god. According to his vision, all men on earth are entitled to clothing and a house over their heads. He also believed in ‘Karma’ and karmic effects in life.
The first and original edition of Sathya Sri Sai Baba’s biography was written by Hemath Bandh. It is an abridged edition of a translation by M.Y.F. Nizam. Sathya Sri Sai Baba’s biography is used by his devotees as a sacred book.
