‘Floods have no adverse impact on tourism in Sri Lanka’

The hotels were not affected due to major floods and disasters that came to Sri Lanka. “Now the weather condition in the country is getting better,” said Minister of Tourism Development and Christian Religious Affairs, John Amaratunga at a press conference in Monara Restaurant in Colombo yesterday.
“The tourism industry was not affected by the natural disaster and there were no direct impact or losses to tourism industry,” the minister said.
The floods and landslides have affected only the interior parts of some districts of Sri Lanka. Key tourist areas patronized by foreigners, namely, the coastal belt of South, East and West, sacred city of Kandy, the cultural triangle and the commercial city of Colombo are not affected and easily accessible by road. Tourist hotels in the country are fully operational. Traveling is safe in Sri Lanka during this period but should be cautious if traveling to flood affected areas of the country.
“This year we are targeting a 2.5 million tourist arrivals”.
However Vice President of SLAITO and Managing Director, Hemas Travel Cluster, Harith Perera said that at Hemas Travels there were cancellations in arrivals to Sri Lanka by about 1to 2% due to major floods”.
“We keep getting lot of inquiries and we are trying to hold on to the bookings.”
The floods and landslides which caused damage to lives and properties in some parts of the country have spared the tourist areas of Sri Lanka. The private organizations and the UN agencies are working closely with the government’s relief efforts of coordination and mobilization of resources.
Minister of Tourism Development and Christian Religious Affairs, Janaka Sugathadasa, Chairman, Sri Lanka Tourism Development Authority (SLTDA), Paddy Withana, Director General, SLTDA, Malraj Kiriella, President - The Hotels Association of Sri Lanka, President, Sri Lanka Association of Inbound Tour Operators, business magnate Harry Jayawardena and other officials were also present at the event.
