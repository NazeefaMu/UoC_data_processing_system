Sports village for Kurunegala

The Housing and Construction Ministry, under its programme of setting up of model sports villages in the country, has made arrangements to set up a sports village in the Kurunegala District.
The National Housing Development Authority has planned to put up 25 houses for talented national and international-level sportsmen and sportswomen who reside in the Kurunegala district.
The candidates should have been in active sports continuously for at least five years to qualify to receive houses from the government. Sportsmen and sportswomen who have become disabled due to sports activities too are entitled to apply for these houses.
Rs. 22 million would be allocated for this purpose, Kurunegala District Parliamentarian and Deputy Housing and Construction Minister Indika Bandaranayake told the Daily News yesterday.
