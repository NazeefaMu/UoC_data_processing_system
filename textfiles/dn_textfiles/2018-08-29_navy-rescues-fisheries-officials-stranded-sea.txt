Navy rescues fisheries officials stranded at sea

The navy rescued sailors stranded at sea, 603 nautical miles off Foul Point, recently.
Naval officers left the Trincomalee Port aboard the SLNS Samudra, after receiving a distress call from a fishing vessel called Jaya Isuru 3 on August 17.
They intercepted the Jaya Isuru 3 on August 19, while it was being towed by another fishing vessel called Brayan Putha 3 due to engine failure. The Jaya Isuru 3 belonged to the Fisheries and Aquatic Resources Department. The navy also rescued a patient suffering from abdominal pain aboard the Ishani Duwa 6 fishing vessel, prior to its return to the Trincomalee Port last Saturday. The patient was admitted to the Eastern Naval Hospital.
