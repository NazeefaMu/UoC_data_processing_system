WE NEED A NEW DISPENSATION

The much required preliminary work to draft a new Constitution has been done. The government should proceed towards the final phase of getting the new Constitution adopted, with the cooperation of all concerned, and as demanded by the people. Ever since the 1978 Constitution was put in place, there has been a cacophony over it. A multitude of voices calling for the dumping of the bahubhoota viyawasthawa and adopting a new one has been there from the time it was enacted and during the lifetime of the presently sitting members of Parliament. It has to be understood, therefore, that the New Constitution should not be a UNP’s or SLFP’s narrow personality slanted constitution as the 1972 and 1978 Constitutions have been. It should be a people centred constitution as it is the people as a whole who constitute the State and empower the Executive, the Judiciary and the Legislature to act on their behalf.
All the legislators who are made members of a Constitutional Assembly and empowered to adopt a draft of the new Constitution should now proceed to do so without dilly-dallying and procrastinating it under any circumstances. Knowing that they are acting on behalf of the people as well as the future generations who will be bound by the Constitution they should have the inner strength to transcend themselves and so deliberate honestly and with foresight over the draft and adopt a New Constitution that will uphold human dignity and rights and in truth guarantee human freedom, equality, justice, fairness and honour for all people. With these assured, there will be peace in our Land.
Some members of the Constituent Assembly are tempted by their own situation in the present circumstances and are surreptitiously moved to waver from the right and just path. Clearly contradicting themselves, there are those campaigning to retain the present constitution with a few amendments to suit their partisan and personal desires. If however, they are to have their way, the country would be led into another epoch of darkness where the peoples’ thirst for justice and fairness will be suppressed by force used undemocratically and power exercised by scoundrels, swindlers and deceitful men and women who not only disregard the law, but justify their actions after breaking the law and getting punished.
NO ROOM FOR FOXES
The people have demanded a New Constitution because there is evidently a need for a new dispensation after a prolonged period of political mayhem of dictatorial despots who wished to exercise exclusive power over everything and have the capacity to rob and horde the common wealth of the people, without being answerable to anyone, under the 1978 Constitution. Most disgracefully all the boot-licking politicians passed an 18th Amendment to enhance the powers of a despot and install an uncouth monarchy, in defiance of the will of the people.
The only power these people did not possess was the capacity to look back on their interior selves, examine their conscience and move towards transparent honesty and the integrity of human dignity. The tragedy is that while they are in the depths of ignominy and corruption, they think that all other people are living in a dark labyrinth and are in need of light. Pretending to bring a light they are planning to evade the justice that should surely overtake them. All those who were responsible for abductions, disappearances, murders, well planned ‘road accidents’ and other heinous crimes of taking ransoms from innocent citizens and every other abuse of power by which the citizens were betrayed, should be brought to justice. No room should be left to restore the reign of political foxes that in their holes devise, plot and plan conspiracies to overthrow a lawful even though still imperfect government, of course constituted not according to their plans.
SINE QUA NON FOR PEACE
In any case, the Constituent Assembly has the onus of presenting a draft of a New Constitution accepted by them to the people to approve at a referendum. Then, it will become a Constitution that surpasses all other constitutions in that the people have participated in the drafting of it and it cannot be summarily dismissed as the product of a partisan adventure.
The New Constitution should assure the liberty, equality and fraternity of the people as the basis of a just society that upholds truth, reconciliation, freedom and bring about a just solution to the national question. This is a sine qua non as a prelude to a lasting peace. No one, including the Head of State should have any space to abuse power and to exercise arbitrary actions, including the use of state resources for one’s own private benefit and of nepotism that favours one’s own kith and kin and political sidekicks to the disadvantage of all others.
The politicians who know their guilt and whose guilt is known by the people should amend their lives, and not hide behind amending bahubhootha Constitutions for self-preservation; they should restore the public property they have stolen and ask pardon from the people. A former chief justice had asked pardon from the people for an arbitrary verdict he had given in favour of a politician.
He has admitted that he had committed an injustice by the people in whose name he was pronouncing judgement. No reimbursement of the gigantic sum of money involved has taken place. The fraudulence caused to the people persists just like the damage caused by the arbitrary actions of politicians.
It is to be hoped that an acceptable level of accountability is established by the New Constitution. And it is to be hoped that injustice caused to the people by the use of inside information and conflicts of interest will be obviated by the New Constitution. The Constitution should not leave room for anyone to arbitrarily gain, especially huge sums of money, by dishonesty and by rank deceiving of State agencies or deceiving anyone, for that matter.
FURNACE OF JUSTICE
No one should have the power to profit by deceiving the people and taking them on a ride, thus engaging in mass breach of trust. Everyone knows that finding an honest politician may be like finding a needle in a haystack. But with a right magnet, even a needle lost in a haystack could be found.
Therefore with the right values, right attitudes and the determination of the people backed by a good New Constitution, honest politicians, like needles in a haystack, could be found. They should indeed be found, however strenuous the attempt may be, and once they have been found, the haystack of evil doers and corrupt politicians who practice lawlessness should be thrown into the furnace of justice where there will be wailing and gnashing of teeth.
When they are given their just deserts they cannot defiantly hold up manacled hands and grinning teeth and be assured of sumptuous meals in a prison hospital as if they are innocent martyrs subjected to an unjust punishment.
