Religious worship at Vavuniya Campus
Ministry clarifies reason  for students’ suspension

A place worship for students of all religious denominations has been established at the Vavuniya Campus affiliated to the Jaffna University, said the Higher Education and Cultural Affairs Ministry and the University Grants Commission, in a press release issued yesterday.
All students have been given freedom to observe the religion of their choice subject to university rules and regulations, the statement said. However, a minor group of students had made an attempt to build a Budu Medura opposite the student hostel by surreptitiously placing a mandapa (wooden structure) for placing a Buddha statue without the sanction of the Dean of the Faculty and Chief Administrative Officer, the release said.
When the Dean of the Faculty and the Administration pointed out to the students that they should use the common place earmarked for their religious observances, they had acted violently resorting to threats and other acts of indiscipline before the administrative authorities.
When such violence and acts of indiscipline take place, the Jaffna University Senate had the legal powers to take the final decision about university discipline relating to the Jaffna University and the Vavuniya campus. Therefore, this action had not placed any restriction on religious observances in the campus.
These students had been suspended from classes due to an act of indiscipline, in order to maintain university discipline in a transparent manner, the statement said.
