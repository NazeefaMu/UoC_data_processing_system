England all-rounder Sam Curran surprised by Lanka’s field settings

PALLEKELE, Wednesday – England’s 20-year-old all-rounder Sam Curran who scored a fighting half-century and figured in a last wicket stand of 60 with James Anderson said that he was surprised by the fields set by the Lankans which enabled them to build up the partnership.
“I was a little bit surprised and I gave myself a chance to take a few more balls because I found it was an easier option to take a single towards the end of the over as they weren’t really bringing in the field,” said Curran at the end of the day.
“Jimmy and me were pretty happy taking the score as deep as possible and getting the extra single. They (Sri Lanka) came into the game with one seamer we thought they probably panicked, but they showed why because this wicket has started to take some turn. The next couple of days is going to be exciting for spin lovers and the batsmen are going to be on their toes.”
Curran said that the last wicket stand was crucial especially the way the pitch was playing.
“It was crucial, you saw in the evening how much it spun. Getting close to 300 was massive for us from 225-9.
Rash (Rashid) played beautifully before tea and I tried to take over where he left off. Jimmy hung around .We got a nice score on the board. Great positive for Leachy to bowl a beautiful ball to get rid of the opener this evening. The spinners have got to play a huge role tomorrow.”
Curran said that he had benefitted a lot playing alongside former Sri Lanka captain Kumar Sangakkara for Surrey.
“We had with him for a few years and it was great. Any batter in the world will want to try and copy the way he plays and the way he deals with situations, more having him around the dressing room has been great,” said Curran.
“He is a great man he is always a man you can talk to when you need and to be with. We made great friends when he was at Surrey. We saw him score hundreds day in and day out we just try to ask the odd question in the dressing room a bit. I try to play my natural way. Kumar was a great help for all of us Surrey players. All in all, a great man.”
Coming on a few tours with England Lions to the subcontinent had also helped Curran to adapt to the conditions and the pitches.
“I came on a few Lions tours to the subcontinent and I came here with the Lions last March. I played against spin and faced a lot of seam back in England. I try to play to my natural style and natural mindset. Lucky enough it came off today. I play my best cricket when I am keeping an open mind,” said Curran.
Left-arm spinner Malinda Pushpakumara stated that the Lankan batsmen will have to score the runs which Sri Lanka conceded in a last wicket partnership between Curran and Anderson.
“We thought we could restrict them to 200. But the last pair as you see added 60 runs and that’s a big bonus for them. It will be tough for us. Our batsmen need to score all those runs,” said Pushpakumara. “We had our plans. We missed an opportunity today.”
Pushpakumara said that their plans is to target a first innings total of 350 plus and that opening bat Dimuth Karunaratne had a big role to play in enabling Sri Lanka achieve that score. “Dimuth if you take he was our best batsmen in the last series. We expect other batsmen to contribute too but Dimuth is the guy in form,” said Pushpakumara.
