Team-work – key to success of Kandy SC, says Udaya Balasuriya

 
The President of the Kandy Sports Club and Old Trinitian Udaya Balasuriya created a record of sorts for himself and the club when he became the first and only President of the Club who in his maiden year itself won the rugby double with an unbeaten record.
It is not known whether there is any parallel to this record in any other rugby playing club in Sri Lanka but certainly not in the recent past Kandy Sports Club has been dominating the rugby scene since 1992 and winning the rugby double with an unbeaten record is out of question during the past 26 years.
Soft spoken and glutton for work Udaya Balasuriya took office as President of Kandy Sports Club in June last year and it was a challenging task to hold this office at a club like this which had just regained the Rugby Double. He had to maintain this trend and cannot be a losing President and end up a cropper.
Speaking to this writer he said they are great and they performed well. They never gave up when faced with a defeat and when the chips were down. Though rugby is a team game and every player contributed his mite towards the success of the club. There were many times when a player came up with individual brilliance to nail the opponents when they were going to defeat us. For example look at the try scored by scrum half Srinath Sooriyabandara and it came from nowhere as he sliced through like a red hot knife on butter and was unstoppable till he reached the corner flag. Full back Nigel Ratwatte made the try conversion under pressure look easy as the ball sailed over. This was a superb team effort. All of a sudden seven points were on the board and we raced towards victory or “snatched victory from the jaws of defeat.” This is Kandy Sports Club and the boys have steely determination to succeed.
Towards the end of the season we had many injuries to keep players but our larder was well stocked and our silent operator and coach Sean Wijesinghe rose up to the occasion to motivate and guide the players and made the crucial changes which brought the winning spirit into the boys. He did not panic as he had the utmost confidence in the boys and having himself played with them he knew their potential and harnessed them well.
Udaya Balasuriya at the helm of the club with support from its Trustee and God Father Minister Malik Samarawickrema have been working hard for the success of the club. They are even present during practices, which in turn motivated the boys.
The club has many development plans and has set its sights on floodlights so that matches could be played after dusk and a swimming pool may come in later. The gymnasium has been upgraded. The players are well looked after with lucrative employment so that they could be retained in the hill capital.
Udaya Balasuriya has done a good job for the club often spending his own funds. He hails from the famous Balasuriya family in Kandy and they are business ‘tycoons’ and have a conglomerate of business in varied fields from tourism to jewllery and even going into agriculture. They have done a lot for sports and one of his uncles had his own club playing ‘A’ Division rugby which may be unique in the history of club rugby in Sri Lanka or Ceylon as it was known then.
Kandy Sports Club has only once before won the double with an unbeaten record that was in 1997 when they became triple champions led by Lasantha Wijesuriya and coached by former Senior Deputy Inspector General of Police and highly successful Police captain and SLRFU President Nimal Lewke who was present at Nittawela for practices all the way from Vavuniya in the days terrorism stalked the country and highways.
This is the success story of Kandy Sports Club and the men behind its success and little is known of them as they are not the try scorers.
