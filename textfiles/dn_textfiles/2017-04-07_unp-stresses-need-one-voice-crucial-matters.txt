UNP stresses need for one voice on crucial matters

Wijeyadasa’s statement on H’tota Port Deal criticized by WC members:
Ministers asked to inform PM before leaving for foreign trips:
The UNP Working Committee members yesterday stressed that the members of the national unity government should have ‘one voice’ on crucial economic and political matters.
Strongly criticising Justice Minister Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe’s recent statement in Parliament over the Hambantota Port deal with China, the UNP Working Committee members said such statements were detrimental to the government and its economic development agenda.
UNP General Secretary Minister Kabir Hashim, Foreign Affairs Minister Mangala Samaraweera, State Minister of International Trade Sujeewa Senasighe and MP Lakshman Wijemanna directed their criticism at the Justice Minister’s statement on the Hambanthota Port agreement, saying the members of the government should act in a responsible manner, when voicing their views on the government’s decisions.
Minister Samaraweera, in a strong statement before the UNP Working Committee, said the government should make the right decisions without pandering to elements attempting to derail the ruling alliance’s economic reforms process.
He had pointed out that, when Sri Lanka Telecom (SLT) employees protested and threatened to die on the streets, the government went ahead with its decision and today the SLT has become a profit-making entity.
Minister had emphasized that the decision on the Hambantota port should be taken in a manner that would benefit the country, in the long run.
Meanwhile, State Minister of International Trade Sujeewa Senasighe said no decision was taken to change key posts in the party at the UNP working committee meeting yesterday.
“Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said that the decisions will be taken only after the May Day,” Minister Senasinghe said yesterday at the Cabinet briefing.
He said that changes are expected after May Day and added that it would happen when the party is being restructured.
Meanwhile, Deputy Minister of Social Empowerment and Welfare Ranjan Ramanayake told the Daily News that the foreign tours of Cabinet ministers and ruling party MPs were also discussed at the meeting.
“It was decided at the meeting that the ministers and MPs should inform the Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe before making any foreign visits,”Ramanayake said.
