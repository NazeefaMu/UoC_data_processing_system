On an ugly phenomenon

Recently the media went to town with a sensational discovery. A torture chamber run by University students was found in proximity to the University of Peradeniya. The academia and the clergy of all denominations as well as the civil society immediately reacted with universal condemnation. Not willing to be left out politicians also joined the chorus.
The phenomenon of ragging fresh batches of students has been prevailing in the University system for decades. Though brutal and inhuman instances of physical and mental torture were periodically reported the furor over such incidents died out with time and nobody cared further about it except the victims and their families.
Physical or mental torture
In the early days when University education was comparatively limited, students from elitist schools dominated and ragging was aimed at “civilizing” the “uncultured” village lads and lasses coming from not so affluent rustic families. Though degrading and humiliating treatment of freshly admitted students took place it was relatively of short duration, often confined to a week and rarely reached scandalous proportions.
With the expansion of secondary education and the increase in the number of University campuses the composition of the student body changed. Rural and middle class students became the majority. It is then the tables were turned. Ragging took a new form. Youth from less affluent families who lived in an oppressive environment hitherto found themselves free from such oppression inside the campuses and they found a golden opportunity to give expression to their animosity towards the elite and take revenge as a class. Unfortunately it was on their fellow students they vent their anger.
In time the duration and intensity of ragging increased. More instances of physical and mental torture became the norm. There were even instances in which students were disabled for life as a result of cruel forms of physical or mental torture. Some others unable to bear up the tension have left the university abandoning their academic pursuit. Though certain politicians and the alumni of the Universities sometimes refer to ragging as a manifestation of a sub-culture it is actually an expression of an authoritarian enforcement of crude egalitarianism and utopian socialism of a petty-bourgeois character. In doing so they also throw overboard historically developed humanitarian and cultural values of the people.
The survival of such a practice for so long shows the failure of measures taken so have failed so far to eliminate or control it. Both the government and the University authorities have heavily relied on legal and punitive measures to stop ragging. Just as the death penalty has been unable to prevent murder the anti-ragging legislation and the deterrent punishments prescribed have been unable to curtail it. It is time the authorities search for more productive methods instead of appealing to the armed forces and the judiciary for everything including the fight against the ubiquitous and tiny Aëdes aegypti mosquito.
It is easy to blame student community as a whole though only a minority group engages in ragging. Actually the rest are coerced into silence. It is necessary to answer the additional question why do they engage in this unwholesome practice?
Obviously there is a fault in their upbringing. The responsibility falls not only on the students but also on their mentors –parents and teachers as well as on the society at large.
There is no methodology for a continuous dialogue with the students on the need to respect the dignity of persons and their human rights, the latter being confined to lecture halls and seminar rooms at the most. The academic staff of the University has to share a major part of the blame for the present state of affairs.
Political intervention
Nor could the government and civil society wash their hands off the problem by blaming the students and teachers. Political intervention has destroyed the academic freedom of Universities and the system of political patronage given to yes-men of the ruling party has led to frustration among both teachers and students. It is no doubt that political groups also use the ragging season to enhance their following and their claims to be innocent bystanders could hardly convince those with first-hand experience of ragging. Student leaders also should be more sensitive to the plight of the hapless fresh students rather than giving into the pressure from the ragging leaders.
Further punishments on mass-scale and disproportionately severe have a tendency to unite both the victims and perpetrators in the struggle for their revocation so that finding a permanent solution to the recurrence of the ragging practice is forgotten till the next ragging session.
Intellectual and democratic dialogue
Universities are no longer centres of intellectual and democratic dialogue where innovative and creative thinking could flourish but closed chambers where only orthodox and hegemonic thought could survive. Hence restoration of university autonomy and the creation of a healthy atmosphere for intellectual and democratic dialogue would also contribute towards eliminating the unwholesome practice of raging.
Almost all political parties claim to uphold human rights and desist from practices that subject individuals or groups to cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment. Yet when their members or leaders commit such acts they wish to look the other way. Such hypocrisy should end. They should stand by what they publicly proclaim. The government should have a long-term plan for finding a permanent solution to this problem. One useful step would be the popularization of modern concepts of human rights and human dignity among the population. It could introduce human rights as a subject in the school curriculum together with other subjects that improve the civic understanding of students.
In its plan for eradicating ragging more attention, significance and priority should be given to prevention rather than punishing the guilty. This does not and should not however, mean excluding legal and punitive measures but relying on them only in the event of a failure of preventive strategies.
