‘Govt To provide vocational training,  employment prospects for youth’

Addressing the inauguration ceremony of a special vocational training programme organized by Ministry of Science, Technology, Research, Skills Development and Vocational Training and Kandyan Heritage, over the week-end, at Talalla, Matara, attended by a large number of youth, Minister of Science, Technology, Research, Skills Development, Vocational Training and Kandyan Heritage, Dr. Sarath Amunugama said that his intention is to provide a sound vocational education, holding out good employment prospects, to youth who miss entering the university just by a few marks. In encouragement of his youthful audience the Minister said in lighter vein. “We will give the traditional higher education system a good run for its money”
The Minister said that although the people of this country, from the time before independence, had sacrificed a good part of the national income to provide free education, a free health care service and a good social protection system and that as result we now have a generation of fully literate, healthy young men and women, unfortunately a large number of them have failed to find satisfactory employment due to the limitations of our traditional higher education system.
The Minister said that in these circumstances his ministry has taken over the responsibility of creating a new generation of youth, empowered with the knowledge and skills demanded by the present day world of work.
The Minister pledged that through these new vocational education courses which will be up to international standards, the doors will be open to the youth of this country, including those who have just missed entering a university, the opportunity of reaching the same levels as could be reached through the traditional higher education system.
He said this will be the mission of all the vocational training institutions under his ministry.
The Minister also revealed that in order to facilitate the vocationally trained youth to find employment, a Job Bank containing all their data in digital format will be initiated at his ministry, the coming week itself.
Recalling that Matara has traditionally been a breeding ground for successful entrepreneurs, the Minister pointed out that some of the new vocationally trained youth could even start their own small or medium scale enterprises, individually or in groups, making use of the easy enterprise loan schemes recently introduced by the government.
