Team  Honda  Riding High

 
At the Cavalry Supercross meet the second week June Team Honda Racing’s Super Motard hot shot Imal Manchanayake sailed away, leaving the pack of riders to scrap among themselves, taking easy victory in both his events for the day.
At the same motocross meet, Shanuka Sandaruwan the Group M-250cc Standard/Modified specialist added valuable points to his own, and to the Team Honda tally, by taking two solid second place finishes.
For Team Honda Racing it was a case of four podium places in the four events contested at the Cavalry Supercross by the Sri Lanka Association of Racing Drivers and Riders (SLARDAR), hosted by the Sri Lanka Armoured Corps at the Pangolle Army Camp, in Kurunegala.
Team Honda’s winning ways come close on the tremendous success of the previous Sunday when Shanuka Sandaruwan and Imal Manchanayake simply dominated the Sigiriya Rally Cross, each rider taking well controlled victories in both their motos of the day. Both Team Honda riders led across the line every lap of the four races they rode.
In Group M-250cc Shanuka Sandaruwan grabbed hole shot and stretched his lead lap after lap to make it two wins in two races. At flag fall in both race 1 and 2, Sandaruwan held an unassailable lead.
Likewise, teammate Imal Manchanayake took total command of both Group SM-750cc motos, open to 2-stroke and 4-stroke, single and twin cylinder machinery upto 750cc. Despite giving away valuable engine size, Manchanayake aboard the CRF250cc Honda Team bike sauntered across the line for the chequered both races.
The Team Honda tally for the day: Four first places finishes in the four races ridden.
Meanwhile, nine-time National Motocross Champion and Team Honda senior Gayan Sandaruwan, after a layoff from the sport, finished a strong 5th in the Group MX-250 Racing Motocross moto 1 at Sigiriya, improving dramatically to a 4th place finish in moto 2.
Team Honda’s Shehan C. Adikari, 2015 Sigiriya Rally Cross Champion Rider and SLADA Champion 2014 and 2015, sat out the Sigiriya and Cavalry rounds, giving an ankle injured from a practice incident time to recuperate.
The Sigiriya Rally Cross - Round 3 of the 5 round SLADA Championship series - was organized by the Sri Lanka Automobile Drivers Association together with the Sri Lanka Air Force.
Six wins, two 2nd places, a 4th and a 5th in these two rounds, and Team Honda Racing are in a good place for Championship titles in the CEAT-SLADA and the CEAT-Sri Lanka Super series.
Team Principal Charaka Perera Director Stafford Motor Company (Pvt) Limited, Honda Two Wheeler Division: “Riders technicians, everyone, in Team Honda Racing is performing superbly. Our sights are set firmly on retaining the Team Championship that we won last year.”
The wheels of the finely prepared Honda CRF250s of Stafford-Team Honda Racing roll out again for the Gunners Supercross at the Sri Lanka Artillery Regiment camp in Minneriya July 10th. Team Honda go with the advantage of two victories here in 2015.
