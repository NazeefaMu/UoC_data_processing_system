The program enhances skills of self employed electrical technicians to be professionals and grooms school leavers to be skilled electricians. The only criterion for enrollment in ‘Kelani Saviya’ training program is to have GCE ordinary level qualifications.
‘Kelani Saviya’ was commissioned in 2007 following signing a MoU between Prof. S B S Abeykoon, former Vice Chancellor, University of Peradeniya and Hemantha Perera, former Managing Director of Kelani Cables PLC .
According to the stipulated terms and conditions of the MoU the CSR program was to end in 2012. However a fruitful discussion between Mahinda Saranapala, PLC Director/CEO, Kelani Cables and the Peradeniya University authorities made the program to be extended for a further period of five years that was till 2017.

Some have become successful businessmen. Mahinda Saranapala, PLC Director/CEO, Kelani Cables PLC said, throughout the year Kelani Cables PLC engages in various CSR programs that shed light on education and environmental conservation. He said ‘Kelani Saviya’ is a special CSR program since it bestows each student with a recognized University certificate. “We pay our gratitude to the engineering faculty of the Peradeniya University for conducting this fully fledged training program,” he added.
