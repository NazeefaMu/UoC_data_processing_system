Lorry runs off road

A lorry plying on the Bulnewa-Endegala road ran off the road near the Koniththa bridge and crashed into an electric post yesterday.
The lorry was travelling from Colombo to Polonnaruwa when the accident occurred.
Eppawala Police investigating into the incident said the driver lost control due to excessive speed. A major tragedy was averted as the lorry came to rest against the electric post preventing it from toppling into the nearby paddy field.
However, the destruction of the electric post caused a powere failure in the area.
