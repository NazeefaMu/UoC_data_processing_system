Driving down to countryside

TITLE: A DECADE IN THE VILLAGE
Author: Mahinda Jayaweera
Mahinda Jayaweera’s nostalgic novel A Decade in the Village is set in the backdrop of post–second world war Sri Lanka, then Ceylon. As Dr Leel Gunasekera in his very perceptive foreword to the first edition of the book says, Jayaweera writes in a fascinating narrative style unique to the writer. He takes the reader through an idyllic rural world which is comparatively humane and strife-free.
A Decade in the Village features a wide variety of social contexts characters located in a particular place, Parakgama in the Kegalle district, spanning a period before and after independence, in fact, a decade. Though classified as a novel, the book is a composite of several narratives, each revolving around a particular character, woven into a strand which conveys deep insight into a way of life now drastically changed. Prof. Siri Hettige observes that “this work borders on the well-established tradition of ethnographic studies of village life in the country as it enables the reader to understand the specific context within a wider spectrum of things, places and times”.
Vital role
The novel begins with the coming of Lawrence, the English teacher to the village school. It is a significant event as he plays a vital role not only in developing the plot of the novel but also in communicating through his impressions and reactions, the seemingly simple but subtle inter-relations of this closely knit society. There are no large-scale conflicts or confrontations, but as to be expected with any human grouping there are frictions and these are observed with sympathy and humour. Lawrence represents in a way the colonial residual but the centrality of his character gives insight into the value system of the society.
His empathy and kindness, the singleness of his commitment to the causes of the village make the village embrace him as a friend. He makes the sorrows of the villagers his own, their joys are his own. He fails twice in love, both instances through betrayal but stands solid and firm. Mahinda Jayaweera weaves into his main character the deeply ingrained concepts of metta and upeksha.
Authority and influence
Village life is projected both vertically and horizontally in the novel. The era he writes about is a period of change as Prof. Hettige observes. It still has residues not only of colonialism but also feudalism. The hierarchical order of the village is realistically presented. The Ratemahmaya, the Weda Ralahamy the Headmaster play dominant roles in the village and their authority and influence are conveyed with understanding and without rancour.
At the bottom level are ordinary men and women. Jinadasa and Sediris who boast about their war experience, Holman who could narrate fiction like the truth. Horizontally the characters represent a cross-section of village life–feudal overlords, government servants, businessmen from the lowlands, village artistes, cultivators and sundry hangers on-Mahinda Jayaweera’s world is rich in diversity.
What recommends the novel is not only this diversity and range, in fact, it comprises ethnic and language diversity because he talks of Tamils from Jaffna and Muslims as well, but the sincerity and understanding he conveys through the novel – the utter decency if one can use the word.
Literal snatch
Life at Parakgama is ideal. There is no hatred or violence, There are of course the weaknesses of the humans. Sirimal, supposed friend of Lawrence literally snatches the girl he hopes to marry. He comes closest to a villain in the novel. But he does not. He reforms after marriage. Lawrence does not bear any grudge. He picks up the threads of his life and moves on. Life continues undisturbed, unfettered.
