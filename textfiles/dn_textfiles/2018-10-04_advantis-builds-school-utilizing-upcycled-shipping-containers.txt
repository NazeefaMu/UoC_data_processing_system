Advantis builds school utilizing upcycled shipping containers

Advantis Engineering, a subsidiary of Hayleys Advantis Limited, recently completed the design, construction and installation of the first school to be built out of shipping containers, – The Headway School of Languages in Batticaloa.
Utilizing the company’s innovative space solution, Convertainers, this latest project, comprising of 32 TEUs (twenty-foot equivalent units), is one of the largest constructions handled by Advantis Engineering requiring a total of 75 days to complete.
The difficulty in creating a building is often lost on those who have access to the resources of Colombo. Gathering the necessary labour and equipment - from the plumbers to the cement mixers - becomes a challenge as you leave urban centers.
Despite the daunting logistical challenges of coordinating a construction across the island from a factory in Colombo, Advantis Engineering managed to deliver a life changing solution to the people of Batticaloa, through their Convertainers concept. Advantis Engineering handled the entire process, end-to-end, delivering a solution that was focused on creating lasting change in a sustainable fashion.
Convertainers by Advantis Engineering, is a novel space solution built by utilizing upcycled freight containers under ISO standards. These units are expected to have a 25 year lifespan with all after sales and maintenance being provided by Advantis Engineering. The prefabricated and modular nature of Convertainers allows them to be tailored to meet any specific need with even future additions to the structure made possible without disruption to ongoing operations, saving both time and money.
The Convertainers concept has gained wide global popularity in recent years. However in order to meet the growing space needs of businesses today, single unit containers will not be sufficient. Being one of few companies in Sri Lanka to offer complex Convertainer solutions that allow for the construction of multi-level buildings, Advantis Engineering provides its clients with a distinct advantage.
“Our Convertainers are the foremost innovation in space solutions. They give our customers a quick, easily made and unique office space that can continue to be customized as their business grows over the years,” said Kamal Wimalaratne, General Manager of Advantis Engineering. “We are delighted to have constructed this beautiful building for the Headway School of Languages and to have played a small part in their ongoing journey to enrich the lives of the next generation of Sri Lankans.”
The Headway School of Languages is the authorized Sri Lankan and Maldivian channel partner for DynEd International, inc. Headway is dedicated to bringing language learning to the masses across the island through language schools which will also connect people to exceptional educational opportunities.
As a subsidiary of Hayleys Advantis Limited, the transportation and logistics arm of Hayleys PLC, Advantis Engineering, constantly strives to provide innovative accommodation solutions for a wide variety of industries.
