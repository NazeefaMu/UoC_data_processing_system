Cheese gets a miniature house

This hamster has its own house and even holds its personalised spoon and bowl while eating. Cheese, the dwarf hamster is owned by Tiffany Zhang, 29, from Manchester, who created a hamster house and trained Cheese to use utensils on her own.
The cute pet has her own bedroom, furniture, and eating gear for snacks. The house has its own stairs, rooms, and bed for Cheese to nap or eat in different areas. Tiffany insists that Cheese even cleans up her own bedroom on a regular basis.
She said: "I've had Cheese for about 16 months and she's unlike any pet I've had. She cleans her own bedroom regularly by throwing out everything she doesn't want in there, mainly her own poops. When she's on her own during the day, she sleeps, eats, digs, cleans her bedroom and grooms herself a lot. She's very adaptable and smart when it comes to the food that she loves, that's how I managed to get her used to eating yogurt while holding mini spoons or bowls herself.
Tiffany added: "I bought a DIY dolls house set from a craft shop and put the house together, then it took me a while to source the furniture which is not only reasonably priced but also the right size for a dwarf hamster. I eventually found some flat pack furniture from eBay which was just about the right size to fit in the house.
The mini cushions, plates, spoons, and bowls are from Japan, I bought them during my last trip to Tokyo because I collect toys and designer collectibles myself, plus I thought it would be a good size for a dwarf hamster." Mirror
