Sporty spirit

Be it cricket or studies, Head Boy of Vidura College Colombo Hemal Ratnayake maintains a fighting spirit. Perfect Prefects feature Ratnayake who feels that attitude is key when it comes to the willow or the books.
Common sense, talent and dreams work best when they come together. Drop one and the rest won’t really work well.
“In life, our mentality and attitude matter a lot. Sometimes because of negative forces created in our mind, we do not believe in ourselves and we think negatively. We think we can’t win. We are scared to win. These youth cannot make the best use of their potential. They cannot harness their potential,” said Ratnayake
Challenging balance
A canny batsman and an apt pupil, Ratnayake has done the balancing act very well.
“I balance both Sports and studies very well. That is perhaps one reason I was selected as the Head Prefect. I am also the cricket captain of school. I must say that balancing both sports and studies is very challenging. I scored 143 runs unbeaten in our big match held last year against I Gate College,” stated Ratnayake.
The captaincy of the team was a result of Ratnayake’s positive mindset and talent and his commitment.
“You can learn a lot to play cricket. You learn how to play as a team, you learn teamwork, you learn how to become a leader, acquiring leadership qualities. I am the school captain and I play for NCC. I am the captain of NCC as well. Playing cricket has really enhanced my personality helping me to lead as a Prefect,” pointed out Ratnayake.
Vidura College has not just produced a batsman who can hit centuries regularly and a student who passes with flying colours, it has produced a patriot.
“Our school teaches us patriotism, meaning that we need to honour our country and work for the greater good of our country. We need to love our homeland, fulfilling the qualities of a man that any country demands of its sons and daughters, which is integrity, uprightness and decency. Our school, Vidura has provided us with opportunities to become citizens with good character, with moral fibre and for this, we have to be constantly thankful,” explained Ratnayake.
Academic path
Ratnayake feels his calling in life other than cricket is to become a doctor. So the academic path he will follow is most likely the science stream.
“My ambition is to become a doctor related to sports, dealing with injuries related to sports. I wish to be of service to others in this chosen field. I have also set my sights on being a cricketer in the future, ideally being able to join the national side,” added Ratnayake.
Ratnayake was recently in India in 2016, Lucknow, for an International School Cricket Premier League organized by CMS India (City Montessori School Lucknow). International Schools all around the world were called and Vidura was one of them. 18 schools participated and from them, nine were from other countries. Other nine were from India.
“It was a great experience for me and it was a live broadcast and my parents were able to watch it on TV. It was one of my best tours. We won a match against the Indian team. Because of Cricket, I have made so friends and formed a meaningful relationship with other people from different walks of life, sharing my experiences and thoughts with them. The exposure I have received is very important and beneficial to my life,” pointed out Ratnayake.
Virat Kohli is one of the best batsmen to emerge in recent times. A clever batsman he is a genius when it comes to leadership and a man who can handle pressure admirably. When it comes to Leaders in history outside of sports he admires Mahatma Gandhi and Nelson Mandela.
Sporting sphere
“When it comes to International sports players I admire Virat Kohli. He kept fighting and now he is the cricket captain in India. Both Gandhi and Mandela were leaders outside the sporting sphere. All three of them never gave up on life. These are the main requirements for being a leader,” said Ratnayake
Brain Drain is a serious problem in Sri Lanka. Some of our finest minds are seeking employment abroad. You can call it the crème de la crème. Minds that can change and uplift this country and society.
“Sri Lanka and many other countries face the problem of Brain Drain. The best brains in the country are going out of the country. Though this is an economic human right of a person it is a problem that Sri Lanka faces. So what we can do is, we can start more private campuses and provide much-needed opportunities. Once these opportunities are there the students can seek the correct stream most suitable for them. A person should identify their own strengths. So they need the avenues for them to pursue their passion. We need our brains in the country to develop our country. They key is supplying them with opportunities for self- advancement,” explains Ratnayake
Knowing oneself is of paramount importance. A student needs to understand his/her strengths or weaknesses. Failures are the pillars of success.
“To become a leader at school level you need to balance both your studies and sports. My school Vidura College has given me a great foundation in this aspect. That is one reason I have continued at Vidura College because of the opportunities I have received,” said Ratnayake.
Great demand
There is a great need for people who can articulate their experiences and who can speak about what made them win in life. Motivational speakers are in great demand in these times.
“A role model to young people is someone who has faced life’s challenges. He/she needs to be someone who can speak to the world about his/her life and motivate the students to uplift the standards of the country. He needs to be someone who can prepare the students to face society, so they will be aware of what society requires of them. So they will be able to fulfil their responsibilities. Of course, the students have to have the common sense to follow certain paths,” said Ratnayake
When it comes to motivation, you can never have enough of it! Parents need to be understanding and children need to have commons sense. A child who has common sense and who has identified his correct path in life cannot go wrong.
“Parents/ teachers should motivate the students to follow their dreams, aspirations and be calling in life. The students should identify their talents and the path they need to follow. I would like to thank my parents and my siblings and all credit should go to my Principal and teachers and cricket coaches,” said Ratnayake.
