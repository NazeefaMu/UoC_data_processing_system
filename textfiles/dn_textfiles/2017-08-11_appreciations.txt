Appreciations

A.W.M. Makeen: A great philanthropist
The 3rd anniversary of popular industrialist and the former Chief Trustee of Panadura, Thotawatta Jumma Masjids, Marhoom Alhaj A.W.M. Makeen fell on the 11th day of the month of Dul-Kahda 1438 according to the Arabic calendar. Abdul Wahid Mohamed Makeen left this world in 2014 on the 4th day of August. A leading industrialist, he was well-known for his forthright and forward thinking views relating to educational development, social and religious reform to the needy. Mainly when the holy month of Ramadan appears, his name is still remembered by the people of Thotawatta as he starts to serve the community at its best. He was fond of reading Lake House newspapers everyday. Also, he kept a good communication with the media people in person, especially from his birthplace. He carved himself as a successful industrialist with great struggle and hard work.
He used to help the poor with passion. He was mastered in overcoming challenges and facing the barriers with strength. There are some interesting facts about him more as a human being. Myself a social activist with fellow mate Alhaj Naleem, we used to catch up with A.W.M. Makeen Hajiyar at his Colombo residence every month.
After the Asar prayers at Bambalapitiya Masjid, we used to contact him and always got a keen welcome. His simplicity was just incomparable as he was being an ordinary person in hospitality.We can never know how much of this sense was innate in him. He makes us want to be better men. He speaks to what's best inside us. He was a great person as he was fond of getting information about Thotawatta, his birth place. He likes to talk about the village while enjoying a cup of tea. His educational endeavours such as the grade 5 Scholarship Felicitation, G.C.E O/L and A/L Scholarships to encourage the students and to make a better career path for needy students were worthy. Makeen hajiyar’s hand in the religious sphere was immeasurable and he served as the Trustee of Thotawatta Masjids. He founded male and female Quran Madrasas at Thotawatta. I, personally feel that it is a huge loss for the community and the village.
We still see young people without prospects for the future. Makeen Hajiyar lit the lives of many and made the people unconditionally smile. He has devoted so much of his precious time in serving the people to complete their needs. He earned the appreciation, and his contribution in the academic sector are countless.
His services and the contributions were not limited within Thotawatta. He was ensuring every time that the deeds were not advertised.
We will never see the likes of Makeen Hajiyar again. But it is great that his sons, Alhaj Milfar Makeen and Alhaj Mizwer Makeen are continuing their father’s pathway in Educational, Religious and Social sectors by making his life's work their own. The “Alhaj Makeen & Hajiyani Zahira Makeen Foundation” along with Macksons Holdings Lead by them, do continue to uphold and sustain Hajiyar’s vision.
May Allah’s blessings shower them.

THE LOVABLE ROGUE IS NO MORE
It is with sadness that I report the passing of Peter Casie Chetty aka Peter Christie. He had not answered his phone for a couple of days when his sister Rachel had rung him. So she had a friend check up on him and found that Peter had passed away in his sleep.
Peter rang me on Wednesday this week at about 11:30 a.m. Melbourne time which came as a surprise as it was 3.30 a.m. in Manchester, UK and his death comes as quite a shock to me though I am grateful he passed away in his sleep and his soul is resting peacefully. We had a long chat and he told me that recently he had been having a number of falls due to his neuropathy in his feet due to Diabetes. He was also labouring in his speech and rang me to somewhat apologise for the recent spate of emails on the subject of “Blazer fabric”. Peter was a lovable rogue who expressed his “views” without fear or fervour in colourful language unbecoming of a gentleman. But, that was Peter. Love him or hate him for his caustic views on the Church, religion and the pretentious people in our society, he always spoke his mind. Some of us were offended by his commentary on various subjects and elected to reject his emails. But, I know that deep within his soul was a kind and generous person but a troubled man whose character had been moulded by his life experiences that he had endured which created such strong views. “The voice” of the Wesleyite alumni community is finally silent. He will be missed.
His body will be cremated in the UK and his ashes will be interred in Sri Lanka.

K.C.Kamalsabayson: IN LOVING MEMORY OF MY FATHER, MY FRIEND, MY GUIDE 10th Anniversary of the demise of former Attorney General
It has been 10 years since the demise of K.C.Kamalsabayson PC. A decade is definitely not what it feels like - the final memory of him seems not so long ago, when I desperately yearned for his life. And nothing has changed .Looking back ten years ago, I lost my father when I was a law student. I remember when my first year results were released in August 2006, we were in Chennai for his first course of treatment. He was extremely anxious all day until we got the call that I had got through, and at that moment I saw in him a very excited child, jumping around the hospital room and announcing to the medical staff 'my daughter is now a diplomate!'. I remember sitting at the edge of his hospital bed while he was walking around the room informing family and friends of the first of my achievements. It was a very happy and fulfilling sight for me. Not once did it occur to me that this could possibly be the only achievement he was to witness in person. In May 2007 I had my second year final exams and I remember how he used to walk me to the entrance of the exam hall for each paper - I remember turning around before the doors of the hall closed behind me only to see my dad standing there waving to me and giving me a thumbs up. He left a week later for his stem-cell transplant in Chennai and just three months later, he left me with the challenge of wading through society by myself. One of the last things he said to me in hospital was, 'please make sure you study. Being qualified is very important. Never ever give up'. I can only take solace in the fact that I lived up to his wishes.
My father was a simple man with a fabulous sense of humour. He loved pranking people, ranging from me to his private secretary. He used to change his voice over the phone and trick me so frequently, that on one occasion when the then President actually called home to speak to him when he was away at a function, I thought it was him pulling my leg as usual! When he got home and I told him I had spoken to the President thinking it was him, and was slightly panicking that the then President might have thought my tone had been obnoxious, he was doubled over laughing.
Another memory is one of Santa Claus. I was a believer, as are many children. I used to write letters of request to the 'man in red' and my father very graciously undertook the task of posting them. When I was around 9-years-old (embarrassingly, still a believer at the time) I had asked for a scrabble board for Christmas. One fine day my father retuned from work holding a bag looking rather dubious. I noticed him hiding this bag (he was totally oblivious to the fact that I was peeking) and later found out that it was the very scrabble board which I had asked Santa to deliver. I was heartbroken - mainly because I was upset that I had ruined my father's age old secret - that he was the household man in red! So I decided to play along and I did so for another couple of years. We were both pretending so that we could give each other this simple joy. Such was our relationship - innocent and beautiful. He was truly my friend, and I absolutely adored him...I still do and I always will.
He always encouraged me and my mother to pursue our interests. My mother is an artist whose talent she herself had shadowed out for the sake of family commitments. He encouraged her to paint again - I remember how he would return from work everyday and the first thing he would do would be to check on the progress of the on-going piece of art. The visual of him looking at the canvass with his signature grin and his hands on his waist is still vivid in my mind. He was my biggest fan when it came to my venture in Bharatha Natyam – all I needed was to see him in the audience with a proud look of approval on his face. We were extremely lucky to have had a hands-on and encouraging husband and father - we are strong and independent women mainly because of his role in our lives. A gift he left behind for a lifetime.
I had the most wonderful relationship with my father. He may have held high office, but he never compromised on family time. It was never about him making an effort to 'make time' - it was his priority and his 'work-life balance' came most naturally to him. This is a quality which is exceedingly rare in today's context, with the hustle and bustle in the rat race to succeed at the workplace, in the struggle to prove oneself worthy as a successful professional, many of us tend to struggle in attaining the ideal way of life. My father left behind a very prudent lesson - that this is not impossible, neither is it a Himalayan task.
Ten years ago when I lost my father I was very young, distraught and confused, unsure of what was to come, with my mother taking upon herself the arduous task of running the house and educating me. These ten years have taught me many lessons by way of struggles, disappointments, success and hard work. It has taught me the strength of a mother single-handedly moulding her daughter into a person fit to survive in society, while grieving the loss of the man who was her all. Ten years later I have earned myself a small place in the legal world, I am a mother, a wife and I stand by my own mother as her companion and daughter. It would have been perfect, if not for the biggest and most painful vacuum – the absence of my father. Yet I do believe that he continues to guide me and I will forever exist in his shadow.
There was a saying which my father used frequently in his speeches and life in general - 'Rising to eminence by merit, we may live respected and die regretted'.
His life and demise have most certainly been testament to this. We miss you Appa. And we love you more with each passing day.

Jehan Kamer Cassim: My inspiration
In my younger years, Friday was the day I would always look forward to, it was the end of the school week, but more importantly it meant that I could spend three days at my grandparents place in that picturesque lane of Kalshrue Gardens. Three days of old stories from the past, walking down the old lane and the countless games of cricket and chess. My grandparents place was indeed 'THE' place to be.
My grandfather, Jehan Kamer Cassim was a man who knew how to make someone smile, no matter how upset they would be and I was lucky to spend so much time with him not even giving him a bit of relaxation after his retirement.
He was the first to hand me a bat and ball and he spent hours and hours playing with me, either in the little garden, the lane outside or occasionally we would wander off to Campbell Park and return once the sun set. We were greeted by my grandmother presenting us with a few snacks. Our biggest connection was through cricket, we both loved the game and through that we both learned to love each other.
As our bond grew stronger, I learnt a tremendous deal about my grandfather's life and I remember one day praying to Allah to let me live a life just like his.
As I grew older, I was not able to see my grandfather as much as I would have liked. I was caught up in my own personal life that I forgot to visit the man who had one of the greatest impacts in my life.
Thank God I realised this a while back and made it a point to frequently visit him. I will never forget the smile he had on his face on these occasions.
He always inspired me to do what I love and to always follow my dreams. He constantly kept reminding me that nothing is impossible and to always challenge myself.
As I prepare myself to take another nostalgic walk down Kalshrue Gardens, it would indeed be a trip down memory lane.
Memories of the beautiful walks we had together will come rushing back and the lane of Kalshrue Gardens may very well be flooded with my tears!

Willam Henry Samaranayake: Remembering a great educationist founder, principal and philanthropist. on his 48th death anniversary
The passing away of William Henry Samaranayake retired principal of St. Bernadette's College, Polgahawela in 1969, had removed from the public life of this country a great educationist and silent social worker whose activities were directed to the welfare of students, many of whom rose to power and distinction. When Samaranayake took over St. Bernadette's college, it had only a few cadjan huts to house the students. Samaranayake's courage and perseverance helped to produce the land and the magnificent buildings which houses the college today. Samaranayake was not only of an unassuming disposition but also had dignity without pride.
He was calm and collected in manner and was a gentleman par excellence. He belonged to an age which is fast sliding into history, but he successfully accomplished his tasks reaching eminence in diverse fields. His philanthropic genius enabled many unfortunates to bask in the sunshine of his great hearted munificence and acts of generosity. Educationists of Samaranayake's stamp, mettle and genius are indeed today rare as sandalwood trees which adorn the jungles of Sri Lanka.
Samaranayake will long be remembered as the great educationist who disciplined and moulded the characters of students to be respectful towards parents, elders and the state. Those student's who occupy positions of dignity in the land today owe a great deal to Samaranayake. He was also a prolific writer to the press and his articles were directed towards creating public opinion. Three great positions worthy of human ambition are to be the ruler of a great city the principal of a great school or the author of a great book. Samaranayake was not only the principal of that great school St. Bernadette's college, but he was also the author of four great books - "English with a Smile" books, 1,2 and 3 and “Practical English” which is almost a vade mecum and a sine qua non to students of English in Sri Lanka. W. H. Samaranayake has gone to his eternal rest, but he will live forever in his great books ‘English with a Smile’ and Practical English’ which as text books in Sri Lankan School have proved and will prove as invaluable guides to generations of teachers and students for years beyond our ken.
The world has lost a great educationist, who was distinguished for his simplicity, his high sense of duty and integrity.
His 48th death anniversary falls on August 26 and his 111th Birth anniversary falls on November 26th.
