Sierra builds, donates ‘Heart Beat Lounge’ to LRH

Little patients visiting the Paediatric Cardiac Centre at the Lady Ridgeway Children’s Hospital (LRH) and their guardians now have the use of a comfortable lobby and waiting area, thanks to the generosity of Sierra Construction Pvt Ltd., a leading engineering and construction solutions company in Sri Lanka.
Aptly named the ‘Heart Beat Lounge,’ the building was purpose designed and built by Sierra as a corporate social responsibility initiative in response to a request by Dr. Shehan Perera, Consultant Pediatric Cardiologist at the hospital who saw the need to provide space for the parents and guardians of children undergoing cardiac surgery.
“The Heart Beat Lounge fulfills a much-felt need at the Children’s Heart Centre of the Lady Ridgeway Hospital,” said Kamaj Wanigasooriya, CEO (Telecom) at Sierra. “As a responsible business entity, we were happy to be able to help the hospital and the thousands of people and children that will visit the Centre over the years. I would like to thank Dr.Shehan for giving us this opportunity and Mr. Chamal Jayalath,Chartered Architect and S.T. B. Dissanayake (C. Eng) at Sierra for their contributions tothe successful completion of the project.”
Before the lounge was built,children and accompanying adults had to wait in a common corridor until the children weretaken into the operating theatre. In addition, all parents who came to see their children in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU)also had to wait in the busy corridor.
The Children’s Heart Centre at Lady Ridgeway Hospitalis the only dedicated Paediatric Cardiac Centre in the country that provides comprehensive cardiac care including diagnostics, cardiac interventions and surgery to children free of charge.
