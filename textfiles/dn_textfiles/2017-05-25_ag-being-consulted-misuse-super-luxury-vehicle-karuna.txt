AG being consulted on misuse of super luxury vehicle by Karuna

The FCID conducting investigations into an incident where former Deputy Minister Vinayagamoorthy Muralidharan alias Karuna Amman had allegedly misused a Presidential Secretariat bullet proof armed vehicle worth Rs.90 million, informed Court yesterday that they have sought Attorney General’s advice regarding future legal action against the former Deputy Minister.
When the case came up before Colombo Chief Magistrate Lal Ranasinghe Bandara, the FCID said that they were waiting for the Attorney General’s advice and sought a further date to report the progress of the case.
The FCID alleged that the suspect had purposely ignored his duty to hand this vehicle over to the Presidential Secretariat following losing his ministerial position in 2015.
The former deputy minister was arrested by the FCID on November last year over the allegation that he failed to return the vehicle to the Presidential Secretariat following losing his ministerial position in 2015. The FCID further alleged that the former deputy minister had failed to return this vehicle until August 2016 by violating the provisions of the Public Property Act. He is currently out on bail.
