Chalmers Granary Land project in Pettah:
Ministry still to find suitable investor

The Ministry of Megapolis and Western Development which has been seeking for a suitable investor to develop the Chalmers Granary Land in Pettah since October 2017, said they had failed to find one under the current scheme.
The Ministry asked Cabinet that they be allowed to offer several options for the payment of the investment, in order to attract investors.
In November 2016,Cabinet approval was granted to develop this land as a mixed development project “to enhance wider corridors for the public to move within the development and to connect the proposed Multi Model Transport Hub (MMTH) in Fort and the Financial Hub in Pettah”.
Around 250 shops at Sir Baron Jayatilaka Mawatha, Olcott Mawatha, Malwatta Road which connect to this land have also been proposed to be connected to this development.
Request for proposals to offer the land over a 99-year lease was called in October 2017 but by the closing date on March 15, no proposals had been submitted.
A meeting for investors had been later convened at the ministry in late March of this year and five investors who had shown up had pointed out that they would consider investing if the terms of payment were changed.
The Ministry thus has offered three options for investors to work with. Cabinet approved the payment schemes offered by the Ministry to investors.
