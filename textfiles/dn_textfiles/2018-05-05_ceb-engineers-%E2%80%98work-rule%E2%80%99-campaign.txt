CEB engineers in ‘Work to Rule’ campaign

The Ceylon Electricity Board Engineers' Association has decided to engage in a Work to Rule campaign from May 8 based on four demands.
Ceylon Electricity Board Engineers' Association President Saumya Kumarawadu said that those demands were to approve the implementation of the long term Low Cost Power Generation project designed by the CEB, allocate lands for the construction of massive scale Low Cost Power Plants, not to put the increasing cost of the power generation due to non construction of Low Cost power plants and to amend the Sri Lanka Electricity Act No. 20 of 2009, to remove the obstacles for the CEB to function smoothly.
