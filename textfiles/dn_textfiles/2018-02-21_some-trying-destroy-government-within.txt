Some trying to destroy government from within

People who crept into the Yahapalana government when their bid to bring back corrupt politicians to power had failed, are trying to destroy the government from within, Viharadhipathi Kadugannawa Kurunduwatta Sri Sudarshanaramaya Ven. Yatiwaldeniye Medhankara Thera said.
The President and the Prime Minister should try to identity these people playing a double game for their personal gain, he said. Ven Medhankara Thera said a large majority of the people gave a mandate to the Yahapalane government to governs till 2020 and no one had the right to distort the result of the two national elections by highlighting the results of the local government elections.
He said the sinister objective of the Joint Opposition was to drive a wedge between the President and the Prime Minister for its own gain, aided and abetted by its agents within the government. As pointed out by the Mahanayake Thera of the Malwatte Chapter, what the President and the Prime Minister ought to do was to buckle down to work to fulfil the pledges given to the people.Unless they did so, people who supported them would finally lose confidence in them, he said.
