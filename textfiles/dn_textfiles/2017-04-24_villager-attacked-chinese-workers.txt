Villager attacked by Chinese workers

A 52-year-old resident of Dambagasara, Dikwella was seriously injured and later transferred to the Matara General Hospital after being attacked by a group of Chinese workers on April 22 night.
They were attached to the Dambagasara worksite of the Matara-Beliatta rail road construction project.
The victim was identified as Olokkuwa Patabendige Somadasa, a father of two. Residents in the Dambagasara in a complaint made to the Dikwella police said lorry loads of soil from the worksite had been transported throughout the night causing environmental pollution and a public nuisance.
On April 22 around 11 pm, villagers had blocked the road forcing lorries laden with soil to turn back.
Moments later, a group of Chinese workers armed with iron bars and clubs came to the village in a van and attacked the villagers.
A team from the Dikwella Police visited the scene on April 22 night and conducted investigations.
The Chinese workers had kept away from work at the Dambagasara worksite.
