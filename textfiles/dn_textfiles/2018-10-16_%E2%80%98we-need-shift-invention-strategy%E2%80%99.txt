‘We need shift to invention strategy’

Sri Lanka cannot steer its economy forward by depending on the export processing zone concept anymore. The only option is to change over to an invention strategy since it has intelligent people and affordable labour, Megapolis and Western Development Minister Patali Champika Ranawaka said.
The Minister was speaking at the inauguration of the second stage of the Aluthgama Central Bus stand development programme recently. The project, costing Rs 45 million, comes under the purview of the Urban Development Authority.
He said instead of a political culture which addressed 20 million stomachs, the country desperately needed an economic policy which addressed 20 million minds.
Minister Ranawaka said during the Ranasinghe Premadasa regime the garment industry which was restricted to Katunayake, Biyagama and Koggala was extended to the rural sector utilising affordable labour. But that concept lost its vigour by the 1990s, because affordable labour could not be found in Sri Lanka anymore.
Now not a single foreign investor would come over to Sri Lanka to invest even if the export processing zones were set up in each electorate. This called for a change in our strategy. The Sri Lankan economy was still stagnating by depending on traditional tea, rubber, coconut and garment exports, the Minister said.
As such, exports had not increased commensurate to the enormous amount of imports, he said.
In 1990, exports amounted to Rs. 5 billion in Vietnam and Sri Lanka. But Vietnam had surpassed us by recording Rs. 175 billion worth of exports, while Sri Lanka lagged behind with a mere Rs. 10 billion. To overcome this situation, we should change over to a new invention strategy, the Minister said.
