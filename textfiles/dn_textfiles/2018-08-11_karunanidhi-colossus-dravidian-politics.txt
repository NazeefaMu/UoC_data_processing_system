Karunanidhi, The colossus of Dravidian politics

INDIA: Muthuvel Karunanidhi was the last of Tamil Nadu's politicians with a colossal mass following, like MG Ramachandran and Jayaram Jayalalithaa.
For decades, the state's politics was dominated by the rivalry between its two towering figures - Jayalalithaa and Karunanidhi.
Jayalalithaa died at 68 in 2016. 90-plus Karunanidhi, a five-time chief minister, had a health scare at the time but was discharged from hospital.
They both had in common great charisma, oratorical skills, and a history in films.
"Kalaignar" (artiste) was famous for his script-writing. The skill greatly helped him in his six-decade-long political career.
Born in Thirukkuvalai on June 3, 1924, a small village in Thanjavur District (now Nagapattinam), he was drawn to the Dravidian movement led by reformist leader Periyar EVR as a teen. He had faced the hardships imposed on him by poverty and his humble caste and Periyar's self-respect movement held untold promise.
A young Karunanidhi was noticed for first time when he led the famous "Kallakudi agitation" in 1953, lying over railway tracks.
He became an ardent follower of Dravidian ideologue CN Annadurai. When Annadurai founded the DMK in 1949, Karunanidhi joined the party that was born out of the Dravidian movement - a social churn that saw the consolidation of lower castes.
"Kalaignar's" RISE
"Kalaignar" rose as a star in both films and politics. He moved to Coimbatore to try his luck at scriptwriting after failing his Class 10 exam.
His screenplay in the 1952 film "Parasakthi," a hit Tamil movie was an example of how the DMK used the silver screen to reach out to the masses.
The DMK wrested power from the Congress in 1967 and never looked back.
When Annadurai died of cancer in 1969, Mr Karunanidhi became chief minister.
In the last few decades, Karunanidhi's political maneuvers ensured that Tamil Nadu was always relevant in national politics. In 1999, the DMK backed the BJP-led government in a no-confidence motion. Later, the two parties contest the national election and the DMK bagged key ministries. But in the next election, the DMK was with the Congress and stayed with the party in 2009. In 2013, Karunanidhi finally withdrew support from the Congress.
On Karunanidhi's watch, the DMK became the family-run party that it is today. The ambitions of an extended family led to political power struggles like between his two sons MK Stalin and MK Azhagiri. The appointment of Stalin, his younger son, as his heir, pushed Azhagiri into a revolt.
Azhargiri was expelled in 2014 after he spoke out too many times against his father and brother.
The DMK patriarch's second undoing was a massive telecom corruption scandal engulfing party leaders like A Raja, his own daughter Kanimozhi and grand-nephews Dayanidhi Maran and Kalanithi Maran.
The party found it hard to live down the 2G spectrum case, widely believed to be one of the biggest scandals in the country, a blow from which the Congress-led UPA never really recovered.
Karunanidhi was chief minister of Tamil Nadu when the scandal broke and at first, denied any public backlash against his party. The DMK was decimated in the next state election in 2011. "The people of Tamil Nadu have given me rest," he said.
But Karunanidhi, a 13-time lawmaker, never lost an election personally since 1957.
In 1974, his efforts led to Chief Ministers winning the right to fly the national flag on Independence Day. Karunanidhi had complained to then prime minister Indira Gandhi that everyone but the chief minister ever got the chance to unfurl the national flag. The centre agreed and on August 15 that year, Mr Karunanidhi flew the flag for the first time.
Karunanidhi was 48 when he first became chief minister. Around that time, he fell out with MG Ramachandran or MGR, a popular actor who had helped propel him to the state's top job after the death of Annadurai. In 1972, he expelled MGR, a mistake that would haunt him for many years.
MGR would go on to form the AIADMK, the DMK's lifelong rival in Tamil Nadu politics.
The AIADMK or All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam came to power in 1977 and MGR made sure the DMK didn't take power while he was alive.
Karunanidhi returned to power in 1989 after MGR's death. When the Tamil Tigers (LTTE) assassinated former Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi in 1991, Karunanidhi - seen as close to the Lankan outfit - was again defeated in the 1991 state elections. Actor politician J Jayalalithaa, a protege of MGR, came to power.
In 1996, it was Jayalalithaa facing corruption charges and the DMK returned to power. Since then, the two parties have ruled every alternate term. Except in 2016, when Jayalalithaa was elected for a historic second straight term.
Over the past few years, the DMK chief was seen to have retreated more and more from public life. He was largely seen in a wheelchair if at all, barely speaking.
GREAT SURVIVOR
The great survivor of Tamil Nadu politics, Karunanidhi was an eloquent orator, a Tamil writer of repute, indomitable publisher and all-weather political strategist. He was an unassuming party campaigner and dedicated communicator who wrote everyday messages to the cadre, penned articles for Murasoli (sound of drums), the DMK’s official newspaper, proofread copies until midnight and then woke up at 4.30 AM to read and record his notes for more than fifty years of his political life. These qualities are testimony to the remarkable career of a politician who had been chief minister five times, was elected 12 times to the Tamil Nadu assembly and once to the erstwhile Tamil Nadu legislative council. Among the qualities that endeared him to friends, critics and political foes were his accessibility and ability to face criticism without bitterness and listen to different perspectives even if he disagreed with them.
Karunanidhi’s role in national politics deserves more attention than it drew during his active political years. As an advocate of state autonomy, he put up stiff resistance to authoritarian rule by then prime minister Indira Gandhi during the dark and brutal Emergency of 1975-77 without worrying about the consequences that included the dismissal of the DMK government and imprisonment of party leaders, including his son, MK Stalin. The role of party newspaper Murasoli and Karunanidhi’s craft for communicating resistance against the Emergency and the draconian MISA will remain etched in the annals of struggles against political tyranny in the country.
The post-Emergency years and the rise of MG Ramachandran after the DMK split in 1972 led to the diminishing of political fortunes for the party. Though Karunanidhi could never wrest power from MGR and the AIADMK for as long as MGR was alive, he steadfastly refused to see a halo around MGR’s larger-than-life persona. Karunanidhi survived almost 13 years in active politics as leader of the opposition after serving as chief minister twice and kept the hopes of his party and cadre alive because of his ideological strength, organisational skills and mobilisational strategies until the return of DMK to power in 1989.
It was during the launch of the National Front in Chennai in October 1988 that Karunanidhi reinvented himself in national politics. He supported VP Singh and his announcement of the Mandal Commission Report with a call for social justice. With the onset of the coalition era in Indian politics, Karunanidhi never looked back. His role in the launching of National Front in October 1988 is a turning point in altering the bipolar national political scenario into a multi-level coalitional strategy in which Karunanidhi played excellent host and strategist in knitting together the seven-party National Front at Chennai.
PARLIAMENT ADJOURNS
In a departure from tradition, Parliament adjourned for the day as the session started, in tribute to Karunanidhi.A five-time Chief Minister and a 13-time lawmaker, Karunanidhi had never been a Member of Parliament.
After obituary references, both Houses of Parliament adjourned. While it is a convention for Parliament to adjourn to pay respects to departed members -- present and former -- the honour had never been extended to a non-member before.
The Centre had announced a day's national mourning for Karunanidhi.
In his tribute to Karunanidhi, actor-politician Shatrughan Sinha had tweeted: "We appeal to the people of Tamilnadu in particular to maintain calm/peace & the nation (read Parliament) in general to announce a national mourning befitting the persona & stature of Karunanidhi. May the departed soul RIP!"
Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Congress chief Rahul Gandhi, Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee and other political leaders are heading for Chennai to pay their respects to Karunanidhi.
SONIA GANDHI MOURNS
UPA Chairperson Sonia Gandhi termed the death of DMK patriarch M.Karunanidhi as a "personal loss", saying he was like a "father figure" to her and the country had become poorer without his wise statesmanship.
In a letter to Karunanidhi's son MK Stalin, she said 'Kalaignar' was a towering figure in the world of politics and public service in both Tamil Nadu and the country.
"For me, Kalaignar's loss is very personal. He always showed me great kindness and consideration, which I can never forget. He was like a father figure to me," she wrote.
"We shall not see the like of Kalaignar again, and our nation is poorer without his wise statesmanship, and his dedication to our country and our people," she also said.
The former Congress president said Karunanidhi was a brilliant literary figure who did so much to promote Tamil Nadu's rich and distinctive culture and arts, and brought worldwide recognition for it.
"His decades at the helm of Tamil Nadu's government and politics have left a superb and enduring legacy, for which he will forever be honoured and remembered. I believe he had full confidence that you would nurture and take forward his legacy," she said in her letter.
"Throughout his long and magnificent life, he stood unwavering for social justice and equality, for the development, progress and prosperity of Tamil Nadu, and for the well-being of every single citizen, especially the poorest and most marginalised," she also said.
Sharing the grief with his entire family, Sonia Gandhi said Karunanidhi lived a long and wonderfully fulfilled life and is now released from suffering. She also lauded Stalin for looking after his father well and with "utmost devotion" during his illness.
ARDENT CRICKET FAN
Former Tamil Nadu Chief Minister Karunanidhi wore several hats during his life. A poet, dramatist, script-writer and most importantly a noted politician in the history of independent India. Along with all these things, the DMK patriarch was also an ardent cricket fan.
According to a report on NewsMinute, Karunanidhi skipped several meetings and appointments to watch the Indian team play and was moved by Sachin Tendulkar’s retirement speech.
“He would somehow adjust meetings, or even cancel them,” one of his staff members was quoted by The News Minute.
After the government decided to honour Tendulkar with the Bharat Ratna, Karunanidhi had said, “You (Sachin) have walked into history and history is bejewelled by your presence. It is quite natural that the Government of India has announced the Bharat Ratna for you in recognition of your unmatched records.” You have set grand standards.”
The report also says that Karunanidhi was a fan of former Indian captain Kapil Dev. But his favourite cricketer was Chennai’s adopted son Mahendra Singh Dhoni, the captain of the popular Indian Premier League (IPL) franchise Chennai Super Kings. He made it a habit to watch CSK matches to catch a glimpse of Dhoni. However, he was forced to stop going to the stadium after a surgery.
Back in 2011, when India won the ICC World Cup, the stalwart awarded captain Dhoni and the team a prize money of three crore rupees. Also, he awarded Ravichandran Ashwin, a Chennai boy, a sum of one crore.
He was also very fond of former Indian captain and opener Krishnamachari Srikkanth, who also hails from Chennai.
The report also mentioned that Sri Lankan legend Muttiah Muralitharan, who is married to a Tamil Nadu girl, was a frequent visitor to the Karunanidhi household.
Whether it was the electoral alliance with the Congress-I led by Indira Gandhi in 1972 or the BJP-led NDA coalition in 1998, Karunanidhi made and unmade alliances based on electoral fortunes than political convictions. He treated allies and rivals alike unequivocally like a seasoned gardener cutting, trimming, and shifting seeds of fortune in the thorny bushes of Indian politics. With his passing away, politics in Tamil Nadu awaits a generational change as time carries away a warrior of Dravidian politics and the last among the giants of first-generation Tamil Nadu politicians after independence.
Karunanidhi leaves his party secure in the hands of his son MK Stalin and the state uncertain with the BJP threatening to alter the political discourse.
The political message is clear: This is not the end of Dravidian parties in Tamil Nadu, but a shifting of focus towards civil society movements.
The battle lines are being redrawn.
