Blind elephant to be transported to Udawalawa

A blind elephant which was found frequenting the Sigiriya Sanctuary and surrounding villages was captured by Wildlife officers on March 15 night. The Pachyderm has been tranquillised and tethered to a tree in preparation to take it by road transport and release it to a much safer area.
Residents said, the elephant which was about 40 years old had been seen loitering in the Sigiriya area for quite sometime. A bhikkhu said, it was a harmless animal which did not pose a threat to anyone. Curious residents were seen flocking round the elephant as it was tethered.
Wildlife officers led by veterinary surgeon Dr. D. M. Dharmakeerthi said, the elephant had many wounds in the body sustained after striking against barks of trees and rocks. They hoped to take the elephant to the Udawalawa Elephant Transit home for medical treatment.
