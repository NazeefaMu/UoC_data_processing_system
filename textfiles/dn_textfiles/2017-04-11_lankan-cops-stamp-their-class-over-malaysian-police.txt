Lankan Cops stamp their class over Malaysian Police

Sri Lankan Police stamped their superiority in the back division, scoring a clear cut victory over Malaysian Police, beating the visitors by 39 points (4 goals, 1 try and 2 penalties) to 17 (1 goal and 2 tries) in the 2nd leg of the IGP trophy rugger match at Police Park yesterday. Lankan Cops earlier beat their Malaysian counterparts in an easy 51-3 win during the fist leg worked off at Nittawela.
It was Sri Lankan Police three quarters who dominated the game with their running rugby. Malaysian Policemen looked tired on the field. Both sides tackled very well but Sri Lankan Polciemen had a superb teamwork to keep their opponents under control all the time.
