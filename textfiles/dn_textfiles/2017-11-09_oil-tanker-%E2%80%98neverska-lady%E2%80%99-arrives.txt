The oil tanker ‘Neverska Lady’ with 40,000 MT of petrol from United Arab Emirates arrived in Sri Lankan waters yesterday.
Petroleum Resource Development Ministry Secretary Upali Marasinghe told the Daily News that the fuel quality will be checked as soon as the ship reaches the Muthurajawela oil refinery complex jetty.
Marasinghe further said that fuel pumping will start by 11 a.m. today, when the oil quality report is received early in the morning.
“Distribution of fuel brought by the ‘Neverska Lady’ will start by today noon,” he further said.
Marasinghe pointed out that the already available petrol stocks will be distributed across the country in the morning today.
He also said they have organised a special 24 hour distribution plan until all the fuel needs are met. The vessel Neverska Lady left Jabel Ali port with a gross load of 27,505 tonnes on November 1, 2017.
