Ravin Wickramaratne defends himself against match fixing

“A single official cannot be involved in match fixing and there is a well planned move going on to destroy my reputation using the Panadura SC vs Kalutara PCC match as an issue,” said Sri Lanka Cricket (SLC) assistant secretary Ravin Wickramaratne at a media briefing held at SLC headquarters yesterday.
Wickramaratne, a former Panadura SC fast bowler, captain and president and presently a cricket administrator has been accused of playing a key role in fixing the Panadura SC v Kalutara PCC division I Premier cricket match played last season to enable his club gain promotion to Tier A.
Defending his reputation Wickramaratne said, “Is there any possibility of one single officer trying to fix a match without the support of the players on the field? According to the Ministry of Sports recommendations only officials should be punished not the players.
However 30 players cum officials were involved in the match so why blame only me?”
Speaking further Wickramaratne said, “I want to clarify a few matters. I never watched this match although the Ministry report into the incident mentions my name. I was not even called and asked to make any statement or for my side of the story by anyone. I have requested the SLC ExCo committee to conduct a detailed investigation regarding this matter and I will write to the Sports Minister as well.”
Wickramaratne stated that he was president of Panadura SC for 10 years and left the presidency in 2015. “Since then I have not been involved with Panadura Sports Club and I am not holding any positions. These incidents reveal a well planned move to destroy my reputation.”
The scandal which took place in January 2017 shook the very foundations of Sri Lanka cricket but one and a half years has passed and no punishment has been handed out to the perpetrators.
