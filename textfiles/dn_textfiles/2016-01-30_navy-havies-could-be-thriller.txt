Navy-Havies could be a thriller

The confrontation between Havelocks SC and Sri Lanka Navy in the Dialog 'A' Division League Rugby Championship second round match at Havelock Park today at 6:30 pm under lights will turn out to be a thriller.
Havelocks will miss the services of experienced national fly half Dulaj Perera due to a serious knee injury which has ruled him out for the season. His place will be taken by ex-Navy fly half Samantha Lakshan. Burly lock forward Jason Meldor is a doubtful starter due to injury and if he does not play Sithum Peiris will fill in the vacant berth.
The forte of both teams has been their power-packed forwards. The Navy 'eight' especially ex-national captain Yoshitha Rajapaksa, Dulanjana Wijesinghe, Danushka Perera, Sajith Saranga and Sathya Ranatunga have to give a terrific display in the loose and secure ball position if they have to pull this game through because the Navy will be given a torrid time by the Park club forwards spearheaded by burly Ganuka Dissanayaka and ably supported by Dushmantha Priyadarshana, Umesh Madushan, Melder, Rohitha Rajapaksa and Muthuthanththri.
Two more matches today
Two other Dialog A division second round matches will be played today with CR & FC hosting CH & FC at Longden Place and Air Force v Sri Lanka Army at Ratmalana.
Police-Kandy a close tussle
The confrontation between Kandy SC and Sri Lanka Police at Nittawela grounds tomorrow (Sunday) should turn out to be a closed game. Kick off at 4:00 pm.
The Policemen who suffered an unexpected defeat at the hands of Navy in their first round game came back to their normal pattern of play against them in their second round where they registered a shock 16-11 victory. Police have been training hard during the last few days and are determined to pull off a morale-boosting win while the Kandy side which registered run away victory's against Air Force by 60 -16 last week will have to be at their very best if they have to beat the high riding Policemen. Going by the two team's performance so far a close tussle for supremacy can be expected.
Kandy will miss the services of their experienced skipper and national captain Fazil Marija due to a serious back injury. His place will be taken by former CR and FC fly half Nigel Ratwatte.
The forte of Police team has been their power-packed forwards. The Police 'eight' especially Bilal Hassan, Sharo Fernando, Terence Henry, Joel Perera, Achala Perera and Radeesha Ranjan have given a terrific display in the loose but they will come up against the Kandy forwards spearheaded by burly Buwaneka Udangamuwa and Heshan Kalhara ably supported by Soyuru Anthony, Kishore Jehan, Damith Dissanayaka, Piyumal Manchanayaka and Gayan Ratnayaka.
In the set scrums experienced Police hooker Achala Perera should get the better of his vis-a-vis Damith Dissanayaka while the line outs should be shared between the Police duo of Archirige and Sharo and Kandy's Soyuru Anthony and Gayan Ratnayaka.
With the new halves combination of Sudam Sooriyarachchi and Mohamad Sheriff having clicked in the last match the Policemen will hope that Sooriyarachchi will set his three quarters in motion at every turn as they have two hard running centres in Mohamad Abzal and Musheen Faleel. In addition there are experienced wingers Chula Susantha and young Reeza Rafaideen who has stood out with their powerful runs down the flank along with their full back Reeza Mubarak often joining the line to form the overlap.
