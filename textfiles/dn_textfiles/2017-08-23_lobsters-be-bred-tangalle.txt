Lobsters to be bred in Tangalle

Lobsters will be bred at a reservoir in an area of 56 acres at Rekawa in the Tangalle DS Division, said State Miniser of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources Dilip Vedaarachchi. He said so addressing the AGM of the District Fisheries Organization in Kirinda.
He added that lobster breeding is a money-spinner; as such, it will be given top priority. The construction work of the reservoir will come to an end within a period of five months. Rs. 32 million would be spent for the project and Rs. 100,000 will be provided to all the fisher folk for the renovations of their houses.
The State Minister further said that it was the fishing community that mainly influenced the economy of the country. As such, the fisher folk are an important sector in our society.
He added that there are 53 rural fisheries organisations in the district and that steps will be taken to strengthen them so that the fisher folk in relevant areas can receive full benefits.
