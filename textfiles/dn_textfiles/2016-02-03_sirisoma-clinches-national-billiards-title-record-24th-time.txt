Sirisoma clinches National Billiards title for record 24th time

Defending champion K.H. Sirisoma of Sri Lanka Ports Authority retained the National Billiards Championship when he overcame S.H.M. Aslam of Moors SC by six frames to one in the final played at the Billiards and Snooker Association headquarters table at Sugathadasa Sports Hotel yesterday.
Sirisoma won the title for a record 24th time in a career spanning over three decades since he took to the cue game.
The final was a one-sided affair as the defending champion brushed aside his challenger Aslam who was no match for him as he took a comfortable four frame lead in the 11-frame final.
Aslam had the consolation of winning the fifth frame but Sirisoma sealed the game with convincing victories in the sixth and seventh frames to create a new billiard record.
Result (Final): K.H. Sirisoma (SLPA) beat S.H.M. Aslam (MSC) 6-1 (100/91, 100/51, 102/96, 103/88, 70/100, 100/85, 101/83)
