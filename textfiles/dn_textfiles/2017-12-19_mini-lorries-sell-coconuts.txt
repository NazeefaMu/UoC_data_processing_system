Mini lorries to sell coconuts

Coconut growers belonging the Coconut Cultivation Board ‘Kapruka Society’ were provided with mini lorries yesterday so that they could reach consumers directly. The members located around the island, will act as a mobile unit which would sell coconuts at a concessionary price of Rs 65 each.
Coconut Cultivation Board Chairman, Kapila Yakandawala participating at the launch said their aim was to connect the grower directly to the consumer, thereby cutting out the middle man. This would also reduce consumer prices of coconuts.
