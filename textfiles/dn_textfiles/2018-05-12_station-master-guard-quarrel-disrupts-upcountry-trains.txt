Station master, guard quarrel disrupts upcountry trains

A sudden railway strike launched by Station Masters operating under the Nawalapitiya Operation Unit caused immense hardship to railway commuters on the upcountry line.
The strike was launched against disciplinary action taken by railway authorities against a station master of the Watagoda station.It is reported that the station master has had an argument with a railway guard last Wednesday. Following the clash, disciplinary action had been taken only on the station master.The station masters of the Nawalapitiya Operation Unit urged railway authorities to take action against the guard, by launching this strike.
The strike launched last night without prior notice was suspended by noon yesterday after the Railways authorities agreed to redress their grievance.
Office trains from Rambukkana to Colombo were also affected as a result of the situation.Trains from Kandy and Badulla were also cancelled causing a severe hardship to commuters.
