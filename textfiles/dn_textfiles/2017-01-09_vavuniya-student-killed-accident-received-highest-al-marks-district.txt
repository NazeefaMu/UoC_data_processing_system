Vavuniya student killed in accident received highest AL marks in district

Sivadurga Sathynathan, a student of Vavuniya Rambakulam Balika Vidyalaya who died on October 12 last year following a road accident the previous day, had obtained the highest marks in the Mathematics stream in the Vavuniya district at the GCE Advanced Level examination held in 2016, according to the results released last week. 
The parents who arrived at the school to peruse the results were thoroughly distraught, holding back their tears ,as they observed their daughter’s excellent marks in the results displayed in the notice board.
Several teachers who were in a pensive mood at the loss of a bright student their school produced were seen consoling the grieving parents.
