Kohli reclaims top spot in ODI batting

NEW DELHI Tuesday: Indian skipper Virat Kohli on Tuesday reclaimed the title of world’s best one-day international batsman, buoyed by two half centuries registered while steering his side into the Champions Trophy semi-finals.
Kohli edged out South African captain AB de Villiers and Australia’s Dave Warner in the latest rankings, taking back the crown for just the second time this year.
The right-handed batsman topped the rankings in January for just four days before relinquishing the title. He is now just one point ahead of Warner, the International Cricket Council said in a statement.
The 28-year-old hit a blistering 81 as India drubbed arch-rivals Pakistan in their Champions Trophy opener, before anchoring their modest chase to perfection against South Africa. afp
