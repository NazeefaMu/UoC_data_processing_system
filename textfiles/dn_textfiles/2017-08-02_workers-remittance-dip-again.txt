Workers remittance dip again

As a result of adverse economic and geopolitical conditions prevailing in the Middle Eastern region, workers’ remittances declined for the third consecutive month in May 2017. Workers’ remittances at US dollars 575.4 million in May declined by 3.7% on a year-on-year basis.
Consequently, cumulative inflows from workers’ remittances declined by 5.8% to US dollars 2,797.0 million during the first five months of 2017 in comparison to the corresponding period of 2016.
