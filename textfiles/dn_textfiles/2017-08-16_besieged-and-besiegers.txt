The besieged and the besiegers
The besieged and the besiegers

King Sitawaka Rajasinghe made a determined effort to drain the lake into the marshes on the east of the city by cutting a deep ditch across the elevated land that separated the lake from the marshes. This he finally accomplished, stranding the vessels in the lake.
He delivered several attacks on the city with all his forces, but the defenders succeeded in repelling them. A mine was dug from the Sinhalese lines to the bastion of St. Sebastian, but the besieged countermined it; and this led to constant and almost daily encounters in which, however, the Portuguese always managed to thwart the plans of the besiegers.
Constant warfare 
The city is cut off from provisions, the people were faced with famine, but the authorities in India dispatched supplies which helped the city to hold out expeditions were also sent out from Colombo to ravage the towns on the coast and bring provisions.
When the siege had thus lasted a year and ten months and both the besieged and besiegers were worn out by the constant warfare. Mathias de Albuquerque arrived in Colombo with a force of 300 Portuguese determined to dislodge the enemy.
The Portuguese sallied out in several detachments from different directions simultaneously and fell upon the encampments of Rajasinghe. When several Sinhalese generals and captains were killed, the soldiers took to flight, and Rajasinghe succeeded in leading the survivors across the river before the Portuguese could pursue. A solemn procession in Colombo celebrated the successful issue of the long protracted and determined siege of Colombo.
Rajasinghe now turned his attention to the Udarata. Its king, Karalliyadde Bandara, had obtained a small Portuguese force for his protection, but one of his chiefs. Weerasundara of Peradeniya assisted Rajasinghe, who, thereupon, marched with a large army and routed the Udarata army at Balana.
Portuguese company
The King and his court fled with the Portuguese escort and were conducted to Trincomalee where the refugees were joined by another Portuguese company. The Udarata submitted to Rajasinghe, who thus became sovereign of a larger tract of territory than any other Sinhalese king of the century. Karalliyadde Bandara who had received baptism under the name of Don John died of small pox, having entrusted his nephew, Yamasingha, and his, infant daughter, Dona Catherina, to the Portuguese, who took them to Mannar where they were brought up with great care.
Having annexed the Udarata, Rajasinghe was, intent on capturing Colombo and devoted heart and soul to the preparation and equipment of a besieging army, consisting of the fighting forces of the many states now subject to him.
For this purpose, he first reduced the status to his will by mercilessly putting to death all those whom he suspected of any disaffection to him, including the greater part of his kinsmen.
Foully murdered
Virasundara who had betrayed the Udarata to him was foully murdered, and his son Konappu with his followers fled to Colombo.
Rajasinghe sent embassies to foreign princes hostile to the Portuguese to solicit their Cooperation-and ask for arms and ammunitions.
The Malabar pirates were persuaded to intercept relief from Goa, while the country around Colombo was carefully guarded so that no provisions might reach the city. Foraging parties scoured the environs of the city, to sack and plunder the villages friendly to Don Juan and Portuguese.
Subjects embittered
But the rigorous and despotic exactions and executions, of Rajasinghe, embittered his subjects to such an extent that they attempted to destroy him by poison. He promptly executed a1i suspected of complicity, without sparing even the Buddhist monks.
Finally, after offering many sacrifices, even of human, lives, as was believed, for the success of his venture, he had a large and fully-armed force from Sitawaka in several divisions, and arriving before the walls of the city, encamped at Boralugoda and on the elevated portions of the marshes of Dematagoda which in consequence are still known as Maligawatte and Maligakanda respectively.
Joao Correa de Brito who had succeeded to the captaincy of Colombo viewed this advance with great trepidation. The city had been cut off from all traffic in merchandise from which its scanty revenues were drawn. Provisions were obtained with great trouble and in quantities scarcely sufficient for the 60,000 souls within the walls.
The fighting force consisted of only 350 Portuguese, counting the old and the weak, assisted by some lascarins; and the fortress was insufficiently-stocked with ammunition and artillery. The captain, therefore, sent urgent messages to Goa and began to fortify the city as well as his resources permitted. The first fortifications built in 1505 withstood the previous assaults but had suffered much from hostile attacks and from the monsoon rains.
Exposed to attack
Brito, therefore, made haste to repair the landward, bastions of St. John, St. Thomas and St. Stephen. The bastion of St. John, which was the principal one most exposed to attack, as it guarded the bay on one side and commanded the plain on the other, was repaired and raised in height and secured by a ditch ending in the sea, and in this ditch-were placed 'pada' boats to serve as parapets for the defenders.
The level plain, 125 paces long from the bastion to the sea, was walled in and raised five fathoms high with battlements, spikes and good artillery. The bastion of St. Thomas was strengthened with thick walls, so that under cover of St. John's it might defend the seashore.
The bastion of Stephen which commanded the plain of St. Thomas (Jinthupitiya), and Galpotha and flanked two bastions on one side and four on the other, was strongly fortified with watchtowers and gun platforms. Portuguese and Sinhala officers of Don Juan, including Konappu Bandara, the son of Weerasundara of Peradeniya who had become a Christian under the name of Don Juan of Austria, vied with one another in erecting fortifications and defending the posts.
Rajasinghe now resumed the work of draining the lake which he soon accomplished by reopening his former ditch and cutting another. Having drained the lake dry, he brought the approaches within four paces of the city walls and entrenched himself with stakes, revetments, portlets, and trenches, while his artillery kept up a continuous fire on the city. To direct him a naval expedition set out from Colombo and devastated the coast towns.
Sinhalese troops
Four general assaults were made on the city of great daring and impetuosity and an array of elephants of war, under the personal direction of Rajasinghe, but they were all successfully repelled by the Portuguese.
Rajasinghe, therefore, attempted to attack the city by the sea, but of the four galleys commanded by foreign mercenaries and carrying Sinhalese troops that set out from Mutwal, two were sunk and the rest forced to flee.
The siege, however, continued without interruption, reducing the city to great straits by famine and disease. The three bastions on the landside were repeatedly and desperately attacked and even mined but were gallantly and successfully defended.
The Portuguese, who had received some scanty reinforcements, ravaged the sea coast towns in search of provisions, plundering and destroying temples.
In the course of one of these marauding expeditions, the famous Vishnu Dewalaya of Dondra was destroyed and sacked by Thome de Souza.
