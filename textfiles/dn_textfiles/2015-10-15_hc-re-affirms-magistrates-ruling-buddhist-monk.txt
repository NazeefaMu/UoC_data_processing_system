HC re-affirms magistrate's ruling on Buddhist monk

The Colombo High Court yesterday ordered the Secretary to the Ministry of Buddha Sasana that steps be taken to suspend the monkhood of a Buddhist monk who was found guilty of issuing death threats and abusing another monk in filth.
The Colombo High Court gave this order while re-affirming a conviction passed by Colombo Additional Magistrate Nishantha Peiris on a Buddhist monk to be sentenced to a six-month-light imprisonment after being found guilty for levelling death threats and scolding in filth to another Buddhist monk at a temple in Narahenpita.
High Court Judge Padmini N. Ranawaka made this order after reaffirming an order given by Colombo Additional Magistrate Nishantha Peiris on September 2014 in a case where Narahenpita Police had initiated an investigation against a Buddhist monk. The High Court dismissed the appeal filed by the accused party, challenging the Additional Magistrate's order.
In his order, the Additional Magistrate had sentenced the accused to six-month-light imprisonment with a fine of Rs. 1,500. The accused was further ordered to pay a compensation of Rs.17,000 to the victimized monk.
