NFF requests to be recognized as an independent

National Freedom Front Leader (NFF) Wimal Weerawansa today in Parliament requested the Speaker Karu Jayasuriya to recognize the NFF MPs as an independent group in the Opposition. 
 
Rising to a point of order MP Weerawansa said he had already submitted a letter to the Speaker signed by 5 NFF MPs stating they intend to work as an independent group in the Opposition by breaking away from the UPFA. 
 
He inquired the response of the Speaker with regard to this letter. He asked the NFF be granted the rights and privileges of other political parties in the Opposition. MP Weerawansa also said there were many past instances where parties which broke away from the Alliances were recognized as independent groups in Parliament. 
 
He said the NFF decided to submit this letter as the Speaker at a previous time told Parliament that the only reason not to recognize them as a separate group in Parliament was that they had not officially separated from the UPFA. MP Weerawansa said they would continue to work with the Joint Opposition. 
 
Citing a past instance, he pointed out the JVP after contesting under the UPFA separated from it, but it was recognized a separate independent group in the Opposition. 
 
The Speaker said he would first take up the matter at a Party Leaders’ Meeting and inform the House later. He said he wants to inquire the opinions of other party leaders with regard to it. “There are 17 political parties in Parliament, and they have also made various requests from me. It is my duty to protect the rights of all” he said.
 
MP Weerawansa said he has no objection for taking up it at a Party Leaders’ Meeting, but requested not to reject his request just because somebody objected to it at the Party Leaders’ Meeting. 
 
At this point Leader of the House and Minister Lakshman Kiriella asked MP Weerawansa whether he had officially informed the UPFA of his decision to break up from the UPFA. Agreeing to this view, the Speaker observed it would be easier for him to make the decision if the UPFA was officially informed by the MP.   
  
The other four NFF members in Parliament include Jayantha Samaraweera, Weerakumara Dissanayake, Niroshan Premeratne and Padma Udhaya Shantha.
