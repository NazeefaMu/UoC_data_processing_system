School dominance was more prominent at the women's championship as seven school players were included in the top 10 rankings, including first, second, third and fourth places. Four schoolboys were placed among the top ten of the Open Nationals, including first and third places. This is a good omen for Sri Lankan chess as youngsters are taking up the sport seriously at national level.
