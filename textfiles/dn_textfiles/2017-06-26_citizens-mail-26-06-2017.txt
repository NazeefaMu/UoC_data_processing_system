[CITIZENS' Mail - (26-06-2017)]

Damaging properties
It is our duty to safeguard our national assets (public or private). People should realize that replacement, repairs etc are borne by the Tax Payers' money which could be used for development.
Mentioned below are some noteworthy incidents:
a) In the case of protest marches vehicles are damaged – buildings are stoned.
b) In the case of strikes, buildings, motor vehicles are set on fire, stoned etc.
c) When an accident occurs, crowd burns the vehicle and manhandles the driver too.
This is in addition to revenue losses occur due to strike. Severe penalties should be imposed when public properties are damaged. Organisations should be warned on time that they have to bear the losses. Sometime back in Singapore, there was a protest organised by immigrant workers and public properties were damaged. Singapore Government did not hesitate in expelling most of them out of the country, others were warned and made to pay penalty.
An American youth was given proper lashes for damaging cars with paint, despite an appeal made by the American President for pardoning. A Singapore lady proudly said on the TV “when you are in Singapore you are bound by Singapore rules. No exemptions are granted”.
This is the attitude we have to develop in preventing capital and revenue losses on a large scale.
We have to stimulate National feeling and love for development.
