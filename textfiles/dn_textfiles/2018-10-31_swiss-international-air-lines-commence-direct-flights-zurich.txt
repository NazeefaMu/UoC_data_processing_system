Swiss International Air Lines to commence direct flights to Zurich

SWISS codeshare with Edelweiss Air will commence direct nonstop flights from Sri Lanka to Switzerland with effect from Sunday November 4, 2018. It will be a twice weekly operation on Fridays and Sundays from Colombo to Zurich with Airbus A340 that accommodate 314 passengers.
Switzerland being one of the smaller countries in Europe outshines many of its neighbours with its internationally positive reputation. The world knows Switzerland – among other things – for the famous and multifunctional pocket knife, ski resorts, cheese, chocolate and watches.
