SLC claims residential training camp in Kandy a success

The national team’s six-day residential training camp at the Centre of Excellence – Kandy ahead of the Champions Trophy 2017 drew to a close with a practice game on Sunday before the team returns to Colombo for three well-deserved days off with their families prior to departing Colombo on May 18.
The program that was spread across an intense schedule of sessions focused on specialty training, strength training and conditioning, altitude training, team building and motivation, strategic simulation and analytical sessions and specialist sessions with the bat, ball and on the field.
The sessions conducted by SLC’s panel of expert coaches were both practical and theoretical, and included group-centric activities such as quizzes and quickfire sessions as well as strategic discussions. Individual players were also given the opportunity for focussed one-on-one training to hone their technique and skills.
Speaking on the success of the camp, skipper Angelo Mathews stated: “A residential atmosphere like this where we can dedicate a 100% to our game is an essential part of preparation going into an important tournament like this. Over the past months many of us have not been able to play together consistently as a team due to injury or other factors, so working together like this and learning to work with and around each other’s strengths is a great thing.
“The scope of facilities at Pallakelle has made this a truly successful program. Working in these professional conditions is truly a bonus, and the technology made available to us in real time Indoor [nets] has really helped us hone our skills, I can’t wait till the centre is completed, it will be a benchmark,” he said.
Team Manager Asanka Gurusinha was also happy with the facilities at the CoE and commented: “With the festive season of Vesak at hand just ahead of this tour, I am really pleased that the SLC president initiated this residential program so that we have the players all focussed and dedicated completely, which obviously would be a challenge in Colombo. There’s no way we could have achieved the desired results if not for the range of facilities here, so I for one am very happy with this facility and for the use we’ve made of it.” – SLC media release
