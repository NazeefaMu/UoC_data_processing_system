Akmeemana Dayarathna Thera released on bail

 
Ven. Akmeemana Dayarathna Thera who was arrested in connection to the attack on the Rohingya safe house in Mt. Lavinia was released on bail a short while ago.
Akmeemana Dayarathna Thera and another suspect were arrested after they surrendered to the Colombo Crimes Division on October 2.
This brings to eight the total number of those arrested for the incident that occurred on September 26. 
A Buddhist monk led mob attack was launched against 30 Rohingya refugees under UNHCR protection in Mount Lavina, on September 26.
The refugees arrived in Sri Lanka in April this year, fleeing Myanmar's military.
