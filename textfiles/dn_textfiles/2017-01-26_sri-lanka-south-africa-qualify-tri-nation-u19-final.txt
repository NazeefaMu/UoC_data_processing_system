Sri Lanka, South Africa qualify for Tri-Nation U19 final

Sri Lanka and South Africa qualified to play in the final of the Tri-Nation Under 19 series after Zimbabwe were eliminated from the tournament following back to back defeats.
Sri Lanka crushed Zimbabwe by a massive margin of 240 runs on Tuesday at Boland Park and yesterday host South Africa beat Zimbabwe by three wickets in a low scoring game at the same venue.
Sri Lanka’s impressive victory was set up by their openers Vishva Chaturanga and skipper Avishka Fernando who both hit centuries apiece and shared a first wicket stand of 191 that propelled them to their final total of 303-6 in 45 overs.
Chaturanga hit 12 fours in his knock of 103 off 101 balls and man-of- the match Fernando had 14 fours and one six in his innings of 108 off 90 balls.
Wicket-keeper Krishan Arachchige weighed in with a spirited 58 off 52 balls (5 fours, 2 sixes). Zimbabwe made a poor reply when they were shot out for a paltry 63 off 19.3 overs with Manelker de Silva taking 3 for 24.
Scores: Sri Lanka U19 – 303-6 in 45 overs (Vishva Chaturanga 103, Avishka Fernando 108, Krishan Arachchige 58, J Shadendorf 2/50)
Zimbabwe U19 – 63 in 19.3 overs (T Nenhunzi 11, Manelker de Silva 3/24, Praveen Jayawickrama 2/2, Hareen Weerasingha 2/15, Mishen Silva 2/10).
South Africa made to fight
South Africa were made to fight by Zimbabwe before gaining a close three-wicket win in their match played at Boland Park yesterday.
In a low-scoring game South Africa struggled to go past the victory target of 112 losing half the side for 71 before some determined batting by Willern Mulder (49 not out off 75 balls) got them over the line in the 30 th over.
Scores: Zimbabwe U19 – 111 in 38.4 overs (R Murray 31, J de Klerk 5/32)
South Africa U19 – 115-7 in 29.1 overs (W Mulder 49 n.o., W Madhewere 3/33)
TODAY: Sri Lanka and South Africa play their last league game which will not have any bearing on the final standings. The final will take place on January 28 at Boland Park.
