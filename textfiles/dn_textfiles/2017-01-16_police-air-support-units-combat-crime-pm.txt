Police air support units to combat crime: PM

Police aviation units or air support units will be set up in cities with helicopters to respond to crime during day and night.The Police service should not be limited to ensuring law and order. It should serve the public in a broader perspective, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said.
“Moves are under way by the government to introduce a macro model which will change the mechanistic organisational functions of the Police. The model is also envisioned to bring about significant alterations to existing criminal laws as regards penalties for drug crimes  and offences punishable under the Excise law and consolidated enactments of Sri Lanka,” the Premier said.
“Germany and Britain have reportedly agreed to support the government to meet the design requirements,” Prime Minister Wickremesinghe said.
The plan and the decision to implement it were discussed with Police higher-ups at a meeting at Temple Trees on Friday.
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe, Law and Order Minister Sagala Ratnayaka, Prison Reforms, Rehabilitation, Resettlement and Hindu Religious Affairs D.M.Swaminathan, Ministry Secretary Jagath P. Wijeweera, Inspector General of Police Pujith Jayasundara and a number of Police top brass were present.
It was outlined here that bi-lingual training will be mandatory for all Police officers under the new model.
Prime Minister Wickremesinghe said the Police have to look at their scope of application and how fast they can reach their targets. They need to look at their capabilities in tackling crime in a modern environment with an appropriate organisational and technical structure.
“The Sinhala-speaking Police officers should be able to carry out their work in Tamil,” The Premier said.
“Police units specialised in tackling computer or internet-enabled crimes will be set up in keeping with the new structure. The officers will be provided with necessary training in countering computer crimes both locally and abroad,” the Prime Minister added.
Meanwhile, the government is taking steps to purchase necessary technologies to set up the modern structure.
Law and Order Minister Sagala Ratnayaka said that the Police need to improve its scope of tackling cyber crime.
“Police need to get better equipped and outsmart cyber criminals,” he said.
Minister Ratnayaka acceded to a request by Police officers to revise drug penalties, tobacco and alcohol related offences, which the Police said were too outdated.
With police informing the minister that they are faced with immense difficulties in controlling numerous protests that are staged in Colombo, Pettah and areas near the Parliament, the minister instructed the Law and Order Ministry Secretary to identify two sites in the city that may be designated to those conducting protests.
He asked the Secretary that the locations concerned may be gazetted for the use of public demonstrations.
