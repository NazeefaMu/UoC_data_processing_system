SLTB-Private buses clash in Vavuniya

 
A tense situation arose this morning when Sri Lanka Transport Board buses clashed with Private buses at the newly opened Vavuniya bus halt today.
SLTB buses were reportedly prevented from leaving the halt and have sustained damages.
Policed were forced to intervene to mediate between the two factions.
The quarrel had spilled out onto the Jaffna–Anuradhapura main road and hampered traffic.
