Eden Gardens - the worst press box in the world?

Eden Gardens in Kolkata maybe famous in many ways for being able to absorb a capacity crowd of 100,000 spectators and provide an atmosphere ideal for cricket but where it falls behind is in its facilities for the media. The venue will easily qualify to be one of the most uncomfortable places for a journalist to cover a cricket match let alone a World T20 event.
The media box we were told can take upto 130 journalist but it was not the capacity that made it uncomfortable but the way the seating had been designed. It resembled a class room. There was one common table fitted with two chairs (which were immovable) where only a pair of journalists can work. The table barely had space to keep the laptop computers and there was hardly any room to take down notes. To make it unhealthier there was a shelf below the table which impeded the free movement of legs. The knees constantly knocked against them and there was no way one could shift the chairs because they were all permanently fixed. If one was stretch a leg you had to turn sideways and place it in the space between tables.
To say the least it was the most uncomfortable press seating ever witnessed at an international cricket venue. One visiting journalist admitted that nothing has been done to make any improvements and it has remained the same since 1999.
To make matters still worse for the journalists covering the World T20 final at this venue, one had to go through the mass of spectators in the stands to the toilet or to dine having to climb up and down several stair cases and travel quite a distance.
For all its history and boast the Eden Gardens press box is a far cry from what Sri Lanka has to offer.
