SA take slender 1st-innings lead

Johannesburg: South Africa squeezed into a first-innings lead of seven runs on the second day of the third and final Test against India at the Wanderers Stadium on Thursday.
On a pitch of increasingly unpredictable bounce and deviation, South Africa were bowled out for 194 in reply to India's 187. Hashim Amla top-scored for South Africa with 61, while Jasprit Bumrah took five for 54 for India, his first five-wicket haul in Tests.
