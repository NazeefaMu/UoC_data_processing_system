'SL, China helped each other during crisis situations'

President Maithripala Sirisena's recent visit to China is an indication of the strong relationship, friendship and goodwill between the two nations, Justice and Buddhasasana Minister Wijayadasa Rajapakshe said.
"Both countries helped each other during crisis situations and China always safeguarded the dignity and self respect of Sri Lanka at every turn.
China and Sri Lanka will remain friends in the future too," he said.
Delivering the keynote address at the inauguration ceremony of the 4th China - South Asia Friendship Organisations Forum at the Kingsbury Hotel, Colombo yesterday, he said in the recent past Sri Lanka and China entered into several key memorandums of understanding for close cooperation covering economic and technical cooperation, urban development, investment promotion, film industry, agriculture and student exchange.
This would not only boost bilateral trade but other social and cultural ties as well, he said.
The first China - South Asia Friendship Organisations Forum was held in 2009 in Beijing.
Media Minister Gayantha Karunatilleke said that Sri Lanka is fortunate to host the China - South Asia Friendship Organisations Forum this year.
"Inter state cooperation as well as establishment of sustainable friendships will be important for such benefits to be meaningful," the minister added.
Chief Guest Speaker Karu Jayasuriya, CPAFFC Vice President Lin Yi and Commercial Counselor of the Chinese Embasy Wang Ying Gi also addressed the gathering.
