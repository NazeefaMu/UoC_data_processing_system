If words  were  weapons

Growth is a slow and steady word for Sri Lanka’s literary landscape. Sri Lankan writers – more without than within the country – are now making their presence known. Chandani Lokuge, among them, has earned a brand name as an academic as well as literary editor. The works of Chandani Lokuge, a professor in Literary Studies and Creative Writing at Monash University, Australia, have now been republished the Australian Scholarly Publishing (ASP), an established Australian publishing house.
ASP values its independence and adds a strong general cultural dimension to its list. Nick Walker, its publisher, offers an explanation about Lokuge’s works: “Australia’s literary heritage is British in its foundation, but it has also been uniquely colonial and, more recently, indigenous and creatively regional in its evolution. Our Arcadia fiction seeks to reflect this—as indeed, to our delight, does Chandani Lokuge in her elegant, evocative writing.”
Reprinted and republished
ASP published Lokuge’s last novel, Softly, As I Leave You, republished by Perera-Hussein, Colombo, to be awarded the Godage National Literary Award for Best Book. The publishing house also reprinted Lokuge’s earlier work If The Moon Smiled and Turtle Nest that were originally published by Penguin Australia and reprinted by Penguin India. The French translation of Turtle Nest was published by Paris publisher, Aux forges de Vulcain.
For her postgraduate research, Chandani Lokuge studied three eminent literary figures: Leonard Woolf, James Goonewardene and Punyakante Wijenaike.
“I researched these three writers for my MA degree as far back as 1985-1987. I’m honoured to note that it was the first MA in English Literature that was conferred by Peradeniya University. The contribution of these three writers to the cannon of Sri Lankan fiction written in English is invaluable. Since completing my MA, my own evaluations of their writing have of course evolved.”
Lokuge now considers Leonard Woolf’s A Village in the Jungle more critically. The colonial civil servant was able to project an insider’s view of that particular dry zonal village and develop the reader’s empathy for his protagonists. All the same his perspective is decidedly imperialist despite his claim to be anti-imperialist.
British colonisers
“As we know, both James Goonewardene and Punyakante Wijenaike commenced writing following Independence, when Sri Lanka was trying to rejuvenate the Sinhala identity, language and culture that had been brutally submerged by the British colonisers.”
Goonewardene’s A Quiet Place and Call of the Kirala, and Wijenaike’s Waiting Earth tends (at times rather desperately) to evoke village identities and ambience, Lokuge adds. While Goonewardene’s portrayal of village life is rather distanced as it is conveyed from the point of view of his city-bred characters who escape into the villages, Wijenaike’s fiction is more deeply embedded in village life and character. Their later fiction is much more complex and offers, Lokuge believes, a more realistic portrayal of Sri Lankan milieu and character as does more contemporary fiction written in English in Sri Lanka. Set in Colombo, and dealing with a medical doctor, Goonewardene’s The Awakening of Dr Kirthi would be a case in point.
Chandani Lokuge’s current research interest is in South Asian, particularly Sri Lankan, diasporic literatures. In 2016, in line with these interests, she founded a new multidisciplinary Humanities project, South Asian Diaspora International Researchers’ Network (SADIRN) at Monash University. It is supported by the Monash Faculty of Arts and affiliated to Monash Asia Institute. South Asia comprises a rich mosaic of cultures each of which is represented globally by its diaspora - Afghanistan, Bhutan, India, Maldives, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka. SADIRN is an effort to cluster these diasporic research communities to promote and disseminate collaborative research within and beyond the network.
Research community
“Our call for membership registration received an overwhelming response – over 135 researchers ranging from senior scholars to postgraduates have registered as members already – showing the significance of this kind of initiative – and how SADRIN may fill a serious gap in our Humanities research community.”
South Asian Diaspora Literary Studies is a challenging and evolving field. The ways in which the diaspora responds to the host and home countries, the ways in which they tread the fine line between them, provide unending challenges for the writer and the critic.
“I’m happy to note that the two earlier novels, both of which embrace the Sri Lankan-Australian experience, have just been reprinted and are now available in book and e-book formats. That shows the demand for South Asian diaspora literature in Australia and beyond. In literary criticism, I have recently edited with Janet Wilson, a special issue of the Journal of Postcolonial Writing (Routledge) with a special focus on Asian Australian Writing. The fact that this particular journal has been selected by Routledge to be published as a book of essays entitled Mediating Literary Borders: Asian Australian Writing confirms the significance of the field to global literary audiences.”
These books include several essays on Sri Lankan diasporic writers as for example, Yasmine Gooneratne, Chandani Lokuge, Michelle de Kretser and Channa Wickremesekere.
Fiction elements
Fiction and non-fiction run on different tracks. But non-fiction such as autobiography can contain some elements of fiction.
“I think that all writing genres, even history, are creative (not necessarily fictional) in the ways in which the author embeds their own personality and perspectives in the documentation of factual material. Autobiography seamlessly integrates the private and deeply personal self (aute), and the documentary of the author’s life (biog). Autobiography is thus a reflection of and meditation on the more public life that is being recorded. Fictional autobiographies tend of course to use fiction deliberately to fill in the gaps in the author’s recollections of life experiences.”
Professor Lokuge also founded and directed the Monash Centre for Postcolonial Writing.
“When I took up employment at Monash, I realised that there was huge potential to develop a hub in postcolonial studies that could be centred at Monash. I founded the Centre in 2002 and directed it until 2012. During this time, the Centre hosted several luminaries and public intellectuals of the postcolonial world including Yasmine Gooneratne and Bill Ashcroft who launched the Centre, Homi Bhabha (Harvard), Robert Young (NYU), Harish Trivedi (Delhi), and writers such as, Kim Scott, Robert Drewe, and Janette Turner Hospital. Several international festivals/conferences were also organized, among highlights, Litfest that was included in the 150th celebrations of the State Library of Victoria, and academic conference jointly organized with Calcutta University. I then branched out from the postcolonial into my current interest in South Asian diaspora studies and founded SADIRN.”
