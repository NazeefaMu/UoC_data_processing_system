Gomez's Instagram made public again

Singer/actress Selena Gomez has made her Instagram profile public again after reportedly switching the settings to private by mistake.
The Bad Liar star hit headlines on December 5 when she blocked users who weren't already among her 130 million followers from viewing her page, shortly after taking issue with comments a reporter made in her recent Billboard magazine cover article.
However, sources tell TheBlast.com the 25-year-old didn't mean to change the account settings, and her profile was restored for public viewing once her representatives were alerted to the tech blunder.
Selena, who was recently named the most-followed person on Instagram for the second consecutive year, has yet to comment on the mishap, but many were quick to relate the apparent need for privacy on Tuesday to her Billboard rant, which was uploaded to her Instagram Story timeline.
In the since-deleted post, the magazine's Woman of the Year honouree highlighted the passage she was unhappy with, in which the writer describes how she has a "five-foot teddy bear sprawled across the kitchen floor" of her Hollywood home.
She is quoted as saying, "It was a gift, and at first I thought, 'This is so ridiculous, I can't wait until I give it away to another person.'"
The snippet clearly upset Selena as she commented on the exchange in dark pink text over the article: "Never will I let another human guess my words ever again. Or invite them in my home. That is so hurtful. The most 'ridiculous' part of that is no one knowing my heart when I say things".
Selena features on the cover of Billboard's Women of the Year issue, and picked up her accolade during the 2017 Billboard Women in Music Awards in Los Angeles on November 30.
