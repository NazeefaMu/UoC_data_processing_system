A welcome move

The decision taken by Cabinet to ban government Ministers and MPs from travelling abroad during the period that Parliament is in session, no doubt, will be welcomed by the public, some, albeit, with reservations. Those who belong to the latter category may query as to what gains will they reap even if all the MPs are present in the House given the levels to which Parliament debates have deteriorated, not to mention the foul language and the fisticuffs that are thrown in for good measure.
The recommendation to restrain Government MPs from making overseas trips during the eight days Parliament meets for a month originated from Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe who had raised concerns about the increasing number of occasions that Parliament had to be adjourned due to lack of a quorum, according to media reports. The President too has expressed his consternation about non-attendance of MPs in Parliament while Speaker Karu Jayasuriya had even taken up the matter with the party leaders after he had to periodically adjourn sittings in the House for want of a quorum.
On one occasion as much as two dozen members of Parliament were abroad at one and the same time which alone speaks for the attitude of MPs towards the country's supreme legislature to which the people elected them to represent their interests. Most often our MPs don't go overseas all by themselves but also take their spouses and family members with them. We once had a Foreign Minister who even went to a country in the north pole in which Sri Lanka had no interests with wife and brood in tow. This Minister was so often overseas that once Parliament had to vote a Supplementary Estimate to meet his foreign travel bills. Former President Mahinda Rajapaksa was known to travel abroad with huge delegations who were accommodated in super-luxury hotels.
Not just Parliamentarians. The travel bug had now even bitten our Provincial Councillors and Pradeshiya Sabha members. It was only recently that the President had to intervene to stop an en-mass departure abroad of members of the Central Provincial Council on what was billed as a study tour.
There can be no objection to MPs going abroad, providing some benefit is accrued to the country from such visits. What is relevant here is the cost benefit factor. Has the country gained by such visits? Sometime back we were told that some MPs had gone to a certain country to study garbage disposal methods in that country. From what we see around us, either the MPs had not learned anything from the trip or this was just another fib to enjoy an all paid for junket abroad.
According to the Cabinet decision, Government MPs are permitted to travel abroad (during sittings days of Parliament) only in case of medical treatment and family emergency. Who will check the veracity of the claims? Given the shenanigans of our people's representatives it will be only child's play for them to overcome these obstacles.
Not just the above reasons. All needless travel abroad by MPs should be put a halt to. Some parliamentarians go abroad even for the flimsiest of reasons when the task could be accomplished by our ambassadors and envoys at the other end. It amounts to a sheer waste of tax payers’ money. There are MPs who go abroad for seminars and workshops while others go on so called study tours. It is moot whether our MPs would have the capacity to absorb anything on these ‘study tours’ given the recent revelation that over one third of our peoples’ representatives have not passed their GCE(O/L) exams, some even not going further than Grade 8.
Now that the Cabinet has decided to curtail Ministers’ overseas visits during Parliament sitting days, measures should also be taken to make it mandatory for all MPs to attend Parliament which coughs up Rs. 4 million of tax payers’ money for each sitting day. We say this because even when they are not abroad, most MPs don't attend Parliament but merely arrive and sign off to ensure they receive their allowances. Steps should be taken to penalize such MPs who show scant regard for their duties and obligations towards their electors.
During the time of late President Premadasa it was rare for the House to go without a quorum. He left strict instructions that all government MPs be present in the House and answer all criticism leveled by the Opposition. Similarly he wanted all questions raised by the Opposition at the start of the sittings or at adjournment be replied to. This is quite in contrast to what is happening today when Ministers are not present in the House to provide answers, or, most often, even the MP, whose questions remain in the Order Paper, doesn't turn up on the due day.
It is hoped that with this restriction imposed on Government Ministers and MPs, they would pay more attention to the business of Parliament, or, at least ensure that a quorum is maintained, to end the spate premature adjournments that is being witnessed on a regular basis.
