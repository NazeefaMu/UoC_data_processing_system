‘Mulled  Wine’  is the latest hair  colour of the season

The latest hair colour trend is inspired by a drink and we are already obsessed with the hue. Introducing ‘mulled wine’ hair, the hue everyone is talking about. From the last few trends CreamSoda, Cider and Spice to Mulled Wine, it is all about holiday cheer now.
Wine, which is mostly a seasonal beverage, just makes this hair colour trend a perfect pick for winters. The colour trend made a way through the viral hashtag and now everyone seems to be obsessed with it. The hue is a mix of deep red, which is also kind of purple and has a hint of chocolate brown.
The shade was a quite a big thing back in the 90s, and is now being celebrated again with a new name. Trending now, the colour has resurfaced just in time for winters and even Aishwarya Rai Bachchan seems to be a fan of this hue. She has been flaunting this shade for quite some time now. Her hair colour is a mix of brown and burgundy shades, which is kind of similar to mulled wine. From winter fashion to nail polishes to even lip colour, this season is all about this timeless shade. So, why keep the hair behind?
