Govt postponing LG elections, Dinesh to go before courts

Mahajana Eksath Peramuna Leader and parliamentarian Dinesh Gunawardena yesterday said that his group will announce how they would contest the forthcoming local government elections after elections are declared by the government.
Addressing a press conference in Colombo, the parliamentarian said that they will have to go before court as the government is in the practice of postponing local government elections citing various issues. He said Speaker Karu Jayasuriya had sent a report to the President finalising the delimitation process though the government is in the habit of postponing the elections citing delimitation.
Gunawardena requested the government to convene parliament according to schedule. He said that parliament was scheduled to meet 8 days within the month of January.
"Parliament met only on one day and the next session is scheduled to be held on January 26," he said. Gunawardena added that they were able to foil the government's attempts to establish an institution outside parliament for the draft of the new Constitution.
The parliamentarian added that those who imported vehicles are waiting the government decisions with regard to taxes.
