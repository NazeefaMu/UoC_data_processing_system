Sri Lanka first to witness trophy for 2018 Soccer World Cup

 
Sri Lanka is fortunate to be the first country to witness the trophy to be awarded to the winners of the 2018 Soccer World Cup in Russia before many nations when it began its 54-country tour prior to the 2018 tournament.
The trophy will be officially handed over to President Maithripala Sirisena soon after it arrives in Sri Lanka on January 23.
The trophy will be displayed at the BMICH, Colombo to the public on January 24 and will tour to its second destination Maldives the same evening.
Football Federation of Sri Lanka (FFSL) officials met the President yesterday at his residence to discuss the official arrangements.
Sports Director General Saman Bandara, National Selection Committee chairman Gen. Daya Ratnayake and Sports Ministry adviser Susanthika Jayasinghe joined in the discussion with the President.
