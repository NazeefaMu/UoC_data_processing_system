CMI Sri Lanka launches first  management excellence awards

For the first time in Sri Lanka, the Chartered Management Institute of UK–Sri Lanka Branch has introduced CMI Management Excellence Awards (CMI-MEA) to reward and recognize brilliance in the field of management among Sri Lankans.
The awards will appreciate and honour the best performers who excel in the field of management and leadership in the country and will also provide a prestigious recognition to the organizations of the award winners.
For 2017, CMI Sri Lanka will bestow 40 awards in three industry categories and two organisational sizes to the premier professionals in both public and private sectors in Sri Lanka.
In association with its knowledge partner, KPMG in Sri Lanka and coordinated with CMI UK, CMI Sri Lanka has developed a rigorous and equitable application and evaluation process, appointing a board of eminent judges from the public and private sectors and academic communities.
The awards application process is open from August 1 till September 30.
Candidates will be evaluated and may be interviewed prior to the end of November, with the process culminating in the CMI Management Excellence Awards night at the Shangri-La hotel Colombo on the December 12.
Secretary to the President Austin Fernando was the Chief Guest at the launch ceremony which was held on the August 1 at the Kingsbury hotel which was attended by a distinguished gathering of both public and private sector professionals and media.
The British High Commission's First Secretary Political Neil Kavanagh and Vice Patron CMI Sri Lanka and British Council Director Keith Davies were the special invitees at this event.
The Chartered Management Institute (CMI) based in the UK with over 140,000 members worldwide, is the only chartered professional body dedicated to promoting the highest standards in management and leadership excellence.
CMI Sri Lanka’s goal is to be one of the most recognized and respected professional bodies in Sri Lanka, in line with the vision of its parent body 'Better led and managed organisations'.
Commenting on this special initiative, CMI Sri Lanka President Malraj B. Kiriella and Chairman of the Organising Committee of CMI- MEA 2017 said, “The award scheme would in return achieve one of the main objectives of the branch: to be the professional home for management and leadership and make them the thought leaders in management practices in the country."
"Furthermore, in the absence of a scheme for recognizing managerial excellence in the country at present, CMI Sri Lanka's initiative would fill a huge important vacuum in this sphere."
The awards will be presented to cover three main sectors in the economy, i.e. Industrial, Agricultural and Services.
Each of these sectors will be divided into two organizational sizes, namely, small and medium and large in both the public and private sectors of the country.
The awards will be presented in the categories of Best Emerging Manager, Best innovative Manager, Woman in Management, Best Manager, Best Future Leader, Best CEO and Lifetime Achievement in Management Excellence while three awards will be dedicated to CMI members and these will be Outstanding Management Student, Highest Contributing CMI Management Professional and CMI Life Time Achievement Award.
