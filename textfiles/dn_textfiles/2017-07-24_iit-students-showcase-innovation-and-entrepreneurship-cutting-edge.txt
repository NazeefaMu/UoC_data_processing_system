IIT Students showcase innovation and entrepreneurship at Cutting Edge exhibition

The Informatics Institute of Technology (IIT), a pioneer in providing British higher education in Information Technology and Business in Sri Lanka, recently held its annual Cutting Edge Exhibition at BMICH.
IIT students displayed innovative projects at Cutting Edge 2017 which was themed “Internet of Things and Entrepreneurship.” This year’s exhibition included over 70 IT and Business related projects which were developed by the institute’s Software Engineering, Computer Science and Business Information Systems (BIS) undergraduates.
“Through their projects they have the ability to transform the future through innovation and to help empower society.
Many of these students have designed or created products or mobile apps. Cutting Edge provides an opportunity for IIT students to be recognised by the industry and corporates for their ideas and projects that inspire innovation,” Chairman of Informatics Group and IIT – Dr. Gamini Wickramasinghe said.
