Pest-resistant new paddy strains

The Batalagoda Paddy Research Station has formulated two fresh varieties of paddy.
According to project officials attached to Batalagoda Paddy Research Station, these two novel varieties of paddy are named BG 369 and BG 3R. Out of them, BG369 is a white variety. Through the successful cultivation of this variety in an acre of land, a harvest of 100 to 125 bushels of paddy could easily be yielded.
It is highly resistant to pests and insect diseases. These paddy plants would not fall even until the point of reaping the harvest.
BG 3R is a red samba strain and the grain of rice is small. About 140 to 150 bushels of paddy could be obtained in successful cultivation in an acre of land. This is highly resistant to pests and other paddy diseases. They could be cultivated even in brackish and salty lands. It is the exception of this strain of paddy, researchers commented.
Within a period of less than three and half months, the harvest could be reaped and they are in high demand among paddy farmers, they further added.
