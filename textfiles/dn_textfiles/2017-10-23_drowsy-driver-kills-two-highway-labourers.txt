Drowsy driver kills two highway labourers

Drowsy driving claimed two lives last Saturday (21) as a car hit two labourers working at a road side on the Colombo-Katunayake Expressway.
The accident took place in the Pamunugama Police Division.
The driver of the car which was travelling towards Katunayake had fallen asleep at the wheel resulting in the car veering off the road at the L 15.4 kilometre post.
The out-of-control-car has then hit two labourers who were cutting grass on the left side of the road. Both succumbed after being taken to the Colombo National Hospital. The deceased are H.K.D. Mahesh,(41) and K.A.P. Perera,(55), residents of Ja-Ela.
The bodies are kept at the National Hospital. The car and the driver were taken into custody. Pamunugama Police is investigating.
