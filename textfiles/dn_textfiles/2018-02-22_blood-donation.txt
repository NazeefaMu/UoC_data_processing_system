Blood donation

To replenish stocks of the Batticaloa Teaching Hospital blood bank, a campaign initiated by the Batticaloa District Secretariat requesting the public, staff, Tri-Forces, and Police to volunteer for blood donation, was held at Kachchri in Batticaloa, recently.
The shortage was due to the increase in road accidents and cases of non-communicable diseases. Narahenpita Blood Bank Unit Director Dr. Rukshan Bellena, Batticaloa Teaching Hospital Director Ibra Lebbai, Additional Government Agent S. Sutharshini, Batticaloa District DIG Yogoda Arachchi, and SP Saman Yaddawera were also present.
