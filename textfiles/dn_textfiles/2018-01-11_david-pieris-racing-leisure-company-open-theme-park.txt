This is the first time that a Karting event of this magnitude and importance will take place In Sri Lanka and in South Asia.We are doubly thrilled as some of the Sri Lankan racers are expected to pose a fierce challenge to Asia’s best racers.

Hosting the Sri Lankan leg of X30 Asia Cup 2018 at the Company’s Kart racing track is going to be the stepping stone for David Pieris Racing & Leisure to explore a unique aspect of the leisure sector.
In line with this, the Company has already scheduled the opening of a theme park along with a resort planned adjoining the SLKC which will commence development in April 2018.
The theme park will cater to local leisure seekers as an alternative weekend getaway to Singapore, Malaysia, Thailand and Hong Kong.
