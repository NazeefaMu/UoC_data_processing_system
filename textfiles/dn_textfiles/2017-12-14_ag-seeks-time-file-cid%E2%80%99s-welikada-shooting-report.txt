AG seeks time to file CID’s Welikada shooting report

The Attorney General yesterday sought further time to file the progress report of the CID investigation into the Welikada prison riot in 2012.
The Court of Appeal fixed the writ petition for February 6 to file the progress of the CID investigation into this incident, by the Attorney General.
The Attorney General yesterday sought another date pursuant to a writ petition which sought an order directing the Inspector General of Police (IGP) and the CID Director to commence an investigation into the Welikada prison riot in 2012 resulting in the death of 27 inmates.
Sudesh Nandimal Silva who was in remand custody at the time of the alleged incidents took place, filed this writ petition citing the Prisons Commissioner General, the CID Director, the IGP, Prison Reforms, Rehabilitation, Resettlement and Hindu Religious Affairs Minister and the Attorney General as respondents.
Silva said he was bringing Court’s attention to what he saw and was within his personal knowledge of the said incidents to obtaining the reliefs.
On November 9, 2012 at about 1.00 pm the petitioner and other prisoners at Welikada prison received information that personnel from the Army and STF were about to enter the prison to conduct a search operation. The petitioner got to know that there was an argument between prison officials and a TID, STF contingent waiting at the gate of the prison on the procedure related to the search operation.
The petitioner stated that the prison was in the control of the Army until 10 am on November 10, 2012. By that time 27 of the prison inmates had been killed by STF, Army, TID and Prison Intelligence. The petitioner has made a complaint to the CID on February 2, 2015.
Silva stated that although four years had lapsed since the brutal killings of these prisoners, no action has yet been taken by the police or the Attorney General to conduct the investigation and prosecute the offenders.
This petition was filed through senior counsel K.S. Ratnavale and counsel Senaka Perera.
