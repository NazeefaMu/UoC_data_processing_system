Uncanny resemblance

Nothing gets past Beyoncé’s fans. Known collectively as the Beyhive, they’re infamous for their fierce defence of their idol and - woe betide the poor fool who decides to mess with either them or their hero.
This even includes Beyoncé’s own dad. And Piers Morgan. But even the ever-observant Beyhive have been hoodwinked by Brittany Williams, who bears such a strong resemblance to Beyoncé that even fans can’t tell them apart.
On the similarities between the two, Brittany, from Detroit, said: “She sings, dances, writes and I am gifted in the same ways; we’re both strong dominant women, fearless, and God fearing.”
As for the attention she’s been getting, it’s been pretty extreme at time.
“I get approached all the time; whether it be on planes, at the airport or while attending events. I’ve also been chased, had pictures taken of me without my consent and pranks done without me knowing. A group of women once chased me and my friend to our car and began singing ‘Single Ladies’, beating my friend’s car with the heels of their shoes until we rolled down the window and took a picture with them.”
While at first it was unnerving, now Brittany takes it all in her stride.
“I’m just a cool, stylish, smart, witty girl with a vision, confidence, and ambition. I’m still dreaming that God will allow my visions to come to fruition. He has blessed me so much.”
Could she even have designs on fame herself? Watch out Beyoncé...
