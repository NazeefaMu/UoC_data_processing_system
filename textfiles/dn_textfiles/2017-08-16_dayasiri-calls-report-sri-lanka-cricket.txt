Dayasiri calls for report from Sri Lanka Cricket

 
Sports Minister Dayasiri Jayasekara has requested for a report from Sri Lanka Cricket (SLC) on the current state of cricket and on the policies and guidelines for the selection process.
Addressing the media today at the Government Information Department, Minister Jayasekara said that he intends to meet all the players after the ODI series.
 “There are few shortcomings that need to be dealt with but I think there is no better team than the prevailing team to play the test series. We will look into their psychological and physical issues - if there are any”, he said.
He said that he believes that the cricketers would become stronger again and added that the public ought not discourage them but extend support.
When asked whether there are any administration problems, Minister said if the cricket administration has to be changed it has to be done at the next election.
“For eight years, the administration was under the interim committees and nobody questioned it.  It was under the new government that an election was held for the first time”, he said.
