Chamara Lakshan left us too soon - MP Dr. Nalinda Jayatissa

Chamara Lakshan was an independent media personality who believed in democracy, JVP Parliamentarian Dr. Nalinda Jayatissa said.
‘Resa’ and ‘Silumina’ Editor-in-Chief Chamara Lakshman allowed space for articles and columns carrying dissenting views, Dr.Jayatissa said while satating that his demise was a rude shock.
“You left us too soon” he said addressing the gathering at Chamara Lakshan’s funeral.
JVP Western Provincial Councilor Sunil Watagala said Lakshan was an exceptional character who stood out from the rest.
“As philosophers have rightly said, there is no point in weeping at an unexpected demise like this. If he was expecting to reach a certain goal, we must continue to pursue it and accomplish it for him. We have to strive to build the society he wished to see” he added.
Western Provincial Councilor Nishantha Sri Warnasinghe rekindling his memories of Chamara Lakshan said the interviews Lakshan conducted helped shape their political career.
“He rendered a great social service through his contributions to Lakbima, Rivira, Irudina, Resa and Silumina. He made a radical change at Lake House. His demise is an unbearable loss to us,” he said.
