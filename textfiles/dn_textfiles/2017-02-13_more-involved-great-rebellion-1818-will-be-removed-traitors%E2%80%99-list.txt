More involved in Great Rebellion of 1818 will be removed from traitors’ list

 
President Maitripala Sirisena will pardon a further 950 individuals charged with treason for partaking in the 1818 Uva-Wellassa Revolution and rename them patriots, Parliamentary Reforms and Media Minister Gayantha Karunathilake said.
The Media Minister told media that the President is scheduled to sign a gazette notification in this regard at a special function to be held at Magula Madera of the Temple of Tooth in Kandy on March 1.
Last year, the President pardoned 19 individuals - including Keppetipola Disawe - who were labeled traitors by British Governor Sir Robert Brownrigg, for leading the struggle to freedom in 1818.
