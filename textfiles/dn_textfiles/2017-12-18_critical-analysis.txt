Assistance to and Protection of Victims of Crime, Witnesses Act No. 4
Critical analysis

The Assistance to and Protection of Victims of Crime and Witnesses Act No. 4 of 2015 has been enacted with the broader objective of protecting and promoting the rights and entitlements of victims of crime and witnesses, two vulnerable segments of society whom hitherto had negligible legal protection.
This Act was enacted in line with the commitment of the government to take meaningful and progressive steps towards transitional justice in a post-conflict Sri Lanka.
The provisions of the Act were implemented with effect from May 18, 2016, by the order of the Justice Minister, published in the Extra-Ordinary Gazette No. 1967/8 dated May 16, 2016.
Who are entitled to protection under this Act?
According to the Preamble of the Act, the two main categories of person’s concerned are,
I. Victims of crime
II. Witnesses
Section 46 of the Act defines a victim of crime as,
i. A person, who as a result of an act or omission which constitutes an offence under any law or infringement of a Fundamental Right under Article 13(1)or (2) of the Constitution of Sri Lanka, has suffered any injury, harm, impairment or disability, whether physical, mental, emotional, economical or other loss.
ii. It includes a child victim and the parent or guardian of a child victim of crime, and
iii. A person who suffers harm as a result of intervening to assist such a person or to prevent the commission of an offence and any member of the family or next of kin of such person, dependents, and any other person of significant importance to that person.
A witness is defined as a person,
i. On whose information or complaint to a law enforcement officer in connection with a commission of an offence or the infringement of a fundamental right or the violation of a human right, an investigation inquiry could commence or has commenced or is likely to commence,
ii. Who has provided information or made a statement containing an account of matters in respect to which such person had been questioned in the course of such investigation or inquiry,
iii. Who has provided an affidavit or submitted a statement in support of a complaint made or any legal action instituted by a victim of crime,
iv. Who has provided information or any communication to a commission,

vi. Who has received summons from a Court or a Commission to make a statement, testify or produce any document, report or object in any such judicial or quasi-judicial proceeding,

x. A family member or dependent of such witness or any other person of significant importance to such person,
xi. An expert witness
xii. A person summoned to testify on behalf of a suspect or an accused.
In addition, Section 6 of the Act enables a person who has provided information, lodged a complaint, made a statement, or given testimony with regard to an offence or infringement of any fundamental or human right at such person’s place of employment or in the employment environment, to claim protection.
Objects of the Act – Section 2
The main objects of the Act are fourfold and strives to;
1) Create a mechanism to promote, protect, enforce and exercise rights and entitlements of victims of crime and witnesses by upholding and enforcing such rights and to assist them by adopting and implementing best practices of protection.
2) Enable victims of crime to obtain compensation from offenders and other redress including restitution, compensation, reparation, and rehabilitation.
3) Set out duties and responsibilities of the State, judicial, and public officers toward the promotion and protection of the rights and entitlements of victims of crime and witnesses.
4) stipulate offences that may be committed against victims of crime and witnesses and set out the penal sanctions imposed,
Sections 3 and 4 of the Act recognise the rights and entitlements of victims of crimes. It is the right of a victim of a crime to be treated with equality, fairness, and with respect to the dignity and privacy, to receive quick redress and to be protected from threats and intimidation, to receive medical treatment for any harm suffered, to be informed of the legal remedies available, to get legal representation by an Attorney-at-Law and to receive relevant information about on-going investigations or Court cases in relation to their offenders. A child victim has a right to be treated in a way that ensures his or her best interests.
A victim of crime is entitled to receive a sum of money for the expenses incurred by him for his participation in any judicial proceeding and to either obtain medical treatment or financial assistance required for medical treatment from the State (subject to the availability of resources with the State) for any physical or mental injury or harm suffered as a result of being a victim of crime.
Although the Act is silent about the rights of a witness, Section 5 spells out the entitlements of a witness.A witness is entitled to receive fair and respectful treatment with due regard to dignity and privacy. A witness should not be intimidated, coerced or harassed for giving information or a statement or testimony with regard to an offence or an infringement of a fundamental or human right and also should be entitled to be protected against any real or possible harm, threat, intimidation, reprisal or retaliation.
The Act provides for the recognition, upholding, and enforcement of the said statutorily recognised rights of victims of crimes and witnesses by adopting the following mechanisms.
1. Stipulating offences against victims of crimes and witnesses and the corresponding penal sanctions
2. Establishment of the ‘National Authority for the Protection of Victims of Crimes and Witnesses’
3. Setting up of a ‘Victims of Crime and Witnesses Assistance and Protection Division’
4. Providing compensation.
Stipulating offences against victims and witnesses
Section 8 (1) to (8) lays down the offences against the victims of crime and witnesses.
These offences include;
i. Threatening with injury to person, property or reputation of the victim or the witness or any associates,
ii. Voluntarily causing hurt or grievous hurt,
iii. Wrongful restraint,
iv. Compelling the victim or the witness to leave any place,
v. Causing damage, wrongful loss or destruction of property of such person,
vi. Harassment, intimidation and coercion or damage to reputation of another person,
vii. Change in the employment,
viii. Putting the life of a victim, witness or informant in danger by dissemination of information with a third party,
ix. Giving gratification to prevent, discourage and dissuade a person from instituting legal action,
x. Giving false information with the intention of obtaining assistance and protection, and
xi. Putting the life of a victim or witness in danger by a person in charge of victim protection.
Which Court has Jurisdiction to hear and try Offences under the Act?
The High Court has the jurisdiction to try these offences and impose a punishment of a term of imprisonment varying from seven to 12 years and a fine. Every High Court should give priority to trials under this Act over other cases and such trails should be held on a day to day basis.
Section 9 of the Act makes all the offences under Section 8 cognizable and non-bailable and no person suspected, accused or convicted can be enlarged on bail, unless under exceptional circumstances by the Court of Appeal. The Court of Appeal, when enlarging a person on bail can impose a conditional prohibition preventing communication and coming into close proximity with a person against whom the offence is committed.
National Authority for the Protection of Victims of Crimes and Witnesses
Section 11 - 16 of the Act provides for the establishment of the National Authority for the Protection of Victims of Crimes and Witnesses.
This Authority has a Board of Management comprising of sevenex-offcio members and five members appointed by the President, should be academically and professionally qualified and selected from fields such as criminology, criminal justice, protection of human rights or medicine.
The Authority is given enforcement, regulatory, operational, and quasi-judicial functions.
The National Authority for the Protection of Victims of Crimes and Witnesses is situated at 428/11 A, Denzil Kobbekaduwa Mawatha, Battaramulla.
Victims and Witnesses Assistance and Protection Division
Under section 19 of the Act, the Inspector General of Police, on the guidelines issued by the National Authority for the Protection of Victims of Crimes and Witnesses, has to establish and maintain a Division named Victims of Crime and Witnesses Assistance and Protection Division.
A senior Superintendent of Police who comes under the supervision of a nominee of the Inspector General of Police, will be in charge of this Division. The said Division was established on November 3, 2016 and is located at No. 9 Mihindu Mawatha, Colombo 12.
The Division is entrusted with the duties of carrying out investigations and providing effective and necessary protection to victims of crimes and witnesses and implementing a victims of crimes and witnesses assistance and protection plan.
Both the National Authority for the Protection of Victims of Crimes and Witnesses and Victims of Crimes and Witnesses Assistance and Protection Division, have a role to play under the Act to create awareness among the public regarding the rights and entitlements of Victims of Crimes and Witnesses.
Providing Compensation
Section 28 of the Act empowers every High Court or Magistrates Court to order an offender to pay as compensation to the victim of crime or witness concerned, an amount not exceeding Rs. 1 million or a sum of money not exceeding 20 percent of the maximum fine payable for the particular offence or both, in addition to the penal sanctions.
· It is to be noted that any victim of crime or witness can seek protection from the National Authority for the Protection of Victims of Crimes, Witnesses and Victims of Crimes and Witnesses Assistance and Protection division, a Court or officer-in-charge of any Police Station. (Section 21)
· On such request being made by a victim of crime or witness, the said authorities—depending on the availability of resources—will provide security to the person and property, temporary accommodation or permanent re-location, temporary or permanent employment, re-identification or any other measure. (Section 22)
· The Act, under Section 29, also provides for the setting up of a Victims of Crimes and Witnesses Assistance and Protection Fund.
· Another noteworthy feature of the Act is that under the Section 31 – 34 it provides for the recording of evidence or statement of a victim of crime or witness through contemporaneous audio – visual linkage without his/her personal attendance before Court, if in the best interest of justice it is found necessary as a measure of protection or as a ground of expediency.
· The lack of awareness among the general public in relation to the scope of the Act and the protection available is a hindrance to the effective implementation of the Act. At the same time, the government should allocate proper funding to build up the infrastructure and to implement the mechanisms introduced under the Act. Another great concern is the practical working of the Act, especially the need for a strong, independent, and impartial Police service in view of the setting up of a Victims of Crimes and Witnesses Assistance and Protection Division that directly operates under the supervision of the Police.
Victims of crime and witnesses, despite being a pivotal part of any civil or criminal proceeding, had no statutorily recognized rights or entitlements by virtue of their status. The Assistance to and Protection of Victims of Crime and Witnesses Act No. 4 of 2015 acts as a light at the end of the tunnel for this so far helpless and hapless category of persons, by establishing a legal regime to protect them. Furthermore, it attempts to incorporate into the legal system of Sri Lanka, the appropriate international norms, best practices and standards in protecting and assisting victims of crimes and witnesses.
