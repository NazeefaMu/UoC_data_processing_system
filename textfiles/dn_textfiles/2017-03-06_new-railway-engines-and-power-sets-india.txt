New railway engines and power sets from India

The Sri Lanka Railways will purchase 10 new Railway engines and six power sets from India under an Indian credit line.
The MOU for the purchase of these engines and power sets manufactured in India was signed by General Manager of Railways B.A.P. Ariyaratne and Executive Director of the Indian government owned production company ‘RITES’ Puneet Kumar in the presence of Indian High Commission's Economic Affairs Consul Suja K. Menon recently, a press release by the Transport and Civil Aviation Ministry said.
US $ 42 million has been granted in respect of the 10 engines and US $ 58 million for the six power sets under the Indian credit line.
GMR B.A.P. Ariyaratne said the Railways Department decided to make the purchase since nearly 55 percent of the department's engines were about 30 year old and about 250 compartments were nearly 25 years old.
The new engines and power sets are built by the Indian government owned ‘RITES” company. The engines are up to European technological standards. The engines and power sets built in association with Sri Lanka Railway engineers according to Sri Lanka specifications could be obtained within one and a half years.
Indian High Commission's Economic Affairs Consul Menon said further strengthening age old ties between India and Sri Lanka, the Indian government will provide concessionary loans to develop the Sri Lanka transport sector. India would come forward to assist in the rehabilitation of rail tracks, repair of old engines, of railway maintenance factories and yards, moderation of signal systems and replacement of old bridges.
Railway Additional General Managers, A.C. Abeywickrama and Dilantha Fernando were also present.
