Open forum on ‘Commercialization of Christmas’

The Journalists' Movement for Media Ethics and Social Justice, (JMMESJ) together with the National Christian Council of Sri Lanka will conduct an open forum on, 'The Commercialization of Christmas', on December 14 at 5.00 pm at the boardroom of the National Christian Council of Sri Lanka, 368/6 Sarana Road, off Bauddhaloka Mawatha, Colombo 7.
The panel comprises several JMMESJ members, Rev. W.P. Ebenezer Joseph, and the NCCSL General Secretary. Discussions will be held in English, Sinhala and Tamil.
The JMMESJ works with a vision to raise awareness among journalists and all relevant parties in the media, including media proprietors and the public, on the need for a value-based and socially responsible national media. Ensuring that these parties' media practice is informed by humanitarian values, respect for Sri Lanka's plurality in its numerous strands, guided by decency and fairness and inculcating in them a deference to and respect for the sensitivities of communities, religions and vulnerable groups, such as, women, children, the oppressed and the disabled is part of the Movement's mission.The National Christian Council of Sri Lanka, identifying the need to enlighten the communities on the heavy commercialisation of the birth of Christ, supports the timely efforts of the Movement.
