Violating the Hippocratic Oath

As the Government Medical Officers’ Association (GMOA) engages in strike action supposedly to win their rights, it is the public that has to face the brunt of it being at the mercy of the government doctors. The GMOA had planned to stage an island wide indefinite strike yesterday, claiming that the government had failed to offer them an acceptable solution over the SAITM issue, but later announced that the strike would be postponed for one week. However, many suspect that GMOA actions are a part of a larger campaign to create political instability. While those who can afford private medical care can cope with such a decision taken by the state doctors, it is those who cannot afford private healthcare that are made to suffer.
The GMOA are proud to claim that they are fighting to preserve the free education of this country. Yet, after utilising public funds to obtain their education, is it fair to jeopardize the lives of the very public who gave them the opportunity to become doctors. Several members of the public expressed their views to the Daily News regarding the GMOA’s constant strike actions.

Just because the GMOA has the right to launch a strike, that does not mean that they can go for repeated strike actions. It is a nuisance on one hand and secondly, caters to the private agendas of office bearers of the GMOA. There is no doubt that they are working on a political agenda. Their first demand was to have regulatory standards for private education. But, now they are going on a huge attack, which is politically not feasible for any government. They are networking with a group of people who are working on their own political agendas. Their speeches show that they have lost their professionalism as well. There are hundreds of doctors who are against it but they do not want to come out and be vilified by them. Even the demand to take over a private institution is not democratic. I must say that the GMOA demands are very primitive and unreasonable. They are taking patients as hostages, therefore, it should be condemned. Not only the patients, but a section of doctors should come out against the GMOA. Unfortunately, they are working on a bigger agenda to topple the government.

I do not approve of the strike launched by the doctors today and it is not justifiable.
Dr. Harischandra Yakandawala
So much time and resources are wasted because of the SAITM issue and the government should solve it as soon as possible with the consent of all parties. Dragging this issue further will not do any good for the country. Both the doctors and SAITM students are correct. The SAITM students spend their time and money because of the `hopes’ given by governments. The people have enough of things to worry about, so it is not acceptable to put them in further trouble. There should be some other way for the GMOA to win their demands.

Up to now, the standard of Sri Lanka’s medical education is at a very good standard and there is excellent world recognition for Sri Lankan doctors. The country produces adequate doctors. Only the cream of the country (Advanced Level Science Examination) become doctors no matter from which district they are from. Sri Lankan medical students who studied in foreign universities and passed the Act 16 Examination are also good. `As an individual, today I am here because of my high IQ level, intelligence, dedication and free education. I am here today not because I had money or `connections’. I am from an ordinary family without a lot of money. I know how much talent medical students in state medical faculties have, because I have been lecturing them since 2002. They can be trained very easily without much effort because they are highly intelligent, she added.

I do not want to say the doctors’ strike is justifiable or not or I do not want to be a part of the doctors strike. Be it SAITM or anything else, it is a real mess mixed up by all types of persons, qualified, not qualified, experienced, inexperienced and irrelevant persons. No party shows an interest in coming to the table, have an open discussion, and come to an agreement and solve the issue.

No doctors’ strike takes place in this hospital because if the doctors strike, around 50 patients die every day without dialysis. Therefore, all trade unions had come to an agreement not to implement strikes at this hospital. The hospital is exempted.

The doctors’ strike is not justifiable because there is a dengue outbreak in the country at the moment and there are a lot of patients who need urgent medical treatment.

GMOA strikes are inhumane, illegal and just disgusting! They are breaching our fundamental rights. Access to health is a universally accepted right of all people. GMOA actions should be controlled before the general public beats them up. When the GMOA conduct strikes, almost all the OPDs stop functioning. It is the section of the hospital where patients are provided medical consultations and other allied services and more importantly, it is the poor majority who goes there. So who is suffering from the GMOA strikes? Patients may not die but they will suffer. I have witnessed poor patients sleeping by the main gates of government hospitals due to the GMOA’s inhumane strikes.
The GMOA is against ‘regulated private education’. But why? The more qualified doctors, the lesser the demand for their private practice. Their demand will shrink, as it will be divided among all qualified doctors. Hence, they fear the influx of new doctors to the field from private education institutes. Health stats are way better in Sri Lanka. According to the GMOA, it is because of health care services only. Yet, it is proven that any state that has a higher literacy rate has high level of health attainments. It is because people are concerned about their living standards. So, we cannot accept the GMOA’s claim which they reiterate in every media show, as if they are the only group who has put an effort to these stats.
How could the GMOA strike during a health emergency? More than 200 people have died due to dengue. The truth is that the government is in bigger trouble and they are unable to create more educational opportunities. The government should regulate the institution if the standards are very low. Just because the GMOA threatens, we just cannot abolish it. We need more qualified doctors to provide a better service.
Meanwhile, the GMOA never questions about the quality of services provided by the private sector. If private health education needs to be stopped, the same should be applied for private practice as well. I am of the opinion that GMOA strikes are unreasonable and should immediately stop.

I am of the opinion that the government should take immediate measures to put an end to the SAITM issue. Now, the GMOA has taken the whole issue into their hands. They are tarnishing the image of all doctors. Even the patients who come to me ask why the doctors are behaving in that manner and ask me why they are not being more responsible. I have got no answer; it is very pathetic, people do not see a difference between a doctor and thug.
I have been practicing for 15 years. When the GMOA launched the strike last time, I went to the hospital as usual. I was terribly upset to hear what people talk about doctors. My father was also a doctor and I was always reminded of the social responsibility. Unfortunately, many doctors give very less importance to their patients now.
I do not personally agree with SAITM, the standards are very low. But, the government is just trying to please all parties and I don’t see any progress in their initiatives. The government should act smarter to stop the GMOA from taking this issue into their own hands.

We cannot argue when our senior doctors ask us not to work. When I was at the University, the students represented the opinion of the Union head. Once I refused to take part in a protest and I told my class mates that I am not going to come as I do not see any logic behind that. The following morning, three guys entered my class room, held my shirt collar and warned me that I cannot go against the decision made by the union. Later my friends forced me to join the protest and I had to scream and shout out slogans along with them. It is the same with many doctors as well, even though I am not a part of the GMOA, I still have to adhere to my senior doctors at the hospital.

Right now at the ministry, we are working to address the full extent of this issue. Especially when it comes to the standards we need to ensure that these standards are upheld. That’s what matters the most. It is irrelevant whether it is privately owned or publicly owned, that is my position.
We have many private schools and hospitals in the country, so private ownership itself is not the problem.
The GMOA’s actions are unacceptable. A responsible trade union would not do this.

It is not clear what the GMOA wants. They are opposing private medical faculties only and they don’t mind other faculties such as engineering etc. In fact they are not even opposing the private medical faculty at the Kotalawela Defence University.
They only seem to have a problem with SAITM. But, they want to have their private practice at private hospitals and have no objection to overseas qualified doctors coming here and practicing after sitting for the Act 16 examination.
It is strange how the GMOA never objected to SAITM during the previous Rajapaksa regime even though it was started during their time.
It is my view that they are having a hidden political agenda behind their actions and they are merely trying to use the SAITM issue to fulfill these political agendas and topple the government.
