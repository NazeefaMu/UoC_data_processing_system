De Villiers gets South Africa home with a ball to spare

Hamilton: A polished Quinton de Kock half century laid the foundation for South Africa’s four wicket win over New Zealand in a tense finish to a rain-shortened opening one-day international in Hamilton on Sunday. In a clash that went down to the wire, it was a man-of-the-match performance from de Kock on a wicket that took an exceptional amount of spin in New Zealand conditions.The departure of de Kock for 69 sparked a middle order collapse as even the New Zealand quicks turned to bowling cutters on the responsive pitch before an AB de Villiers rescue mission saw his side home with a ball to spare.
“We never expected it to turn like that in Hamilton,” de Villiers said.
“From past experience this becomes a really good batting track in the evening but that was far from it.”
With the fixture reduced to 34 overs a side following heavy rain early in the day, New Zealand posted 207 for seven, boosted by a whirlwind 51 off 23 balls at the end by unbeaten pair Colin de Grandhomme and Tim Southee. AFP
