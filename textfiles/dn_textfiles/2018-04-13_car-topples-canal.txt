Car topples  into canal

A car had plunged into a canal when the driver had stepped on the accelerator instead of the brakes at Wakirigala on Wednesday (11).
The individual, who was identified as a resident of Ahasliyadda, was admitted to the Kegalle Base Hospital. A small child travelling in the vehicle at the same time was also rescued with only minor injuries.
It was revealed that the driver had purchased the vehicle on Wednesday morning and had mistakenly stepped on the accelerator in an attempt to change course.
Aranayake Police are investigating.
