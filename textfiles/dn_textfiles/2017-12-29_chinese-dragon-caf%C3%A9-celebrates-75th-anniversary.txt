Chinese Dragon Café celebrates  75th anniversary

Chinese Dragon Café Private Limited, the pioneering restaurant chain in Sri Lanka’s Chinese restaurant sphere engaged in a CSR initiative with religious activities to celebrate its 75th anniversary.
Religious ceremony and celebrations took place with the participation of Naishadh Udeshi, Managing Director, Chinese Dragon Café and the Board of Directors at the Bambalapitiya outlet which is the first outlet of this restaurant chain.
Under the theme of 'Meal to Remember', Chinese Dragon Café took the initiative in a CSR activity providing lunch for children at Preethipura Children’s Home and milk powder to its infant home at Hendala.
A friendly get-together was held for all employees of Chinese Dragon Café at the head office premises at Canal Road, Hendala, Wattala. Employees who have completed 10 to 20 years received accolades, anniversary plaques, certificates and cash prizes while those with a service of five to ten years received certificates and anniversary plaques.
Naishadh Udeshi, Managing Director, Chinese Dragon Café, said, “As the foremost Chinese restaurant in the country, we have been in the sphere for 75 long years. Over time, many famous restaurants faded away as a result of not sustaining standards of food and non-compliance with change in food habits and lifestyles of people.”
To coincide with its 75th anniversary, Chinese Dragon Café introduced five new dishes, Dragon Crispy Fried prawns, Dragon Malaysian Spare Ribs, Dragon Mixed Grill, Dragon Prawn Toast and Dragon Cuttlefish Balls.
