UNP will field PM as Presidential candidate: Field Marshal Fonseka

The UNP will field Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe as its candidate for the next Presidential election. The final decision as to whether he will take up the challenge or he has any contrary view or objection to it, rests with Prime Minister Wickremesinghe himself, Sustainable Development, Wild Life and Regional Development Minister Field Marshal Sarath Fonseka said.
Field Marshal Fonseka said this in response to a question posed by the media, during his visit to Naula, Matale, recently.
Field Marshal Fonseka said several other people have also expressed the desire to contest the next Presidential election while many had volunteered to pay the election deposit for certain prospective candidates.
Although it was good to see such persons contesting the Presidential election, it would be a great pity if such people get imprisoned before the next election.
He said Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe is currently on a tour of Singapore and the Prime Minister had clearly stated that he had no contact or connection with Arjuna Mahendran at present.
Expressing his views of the current political situation in the country, Field Marshal Fonseka said the government would continue for the rest of its term without any problem.
Although the opposition levelled various accusations against the government, it would never allow a repetition of the recent untoward incidents.
He said that even though the employment problem was not fully settled, price of goods and fuel have been maintained at a reasonable level. The government would move forward by remedying the outstanding shortcomings, he added.
