No.1 coal power generation machine breaks down for 37th time: Minister

Norochcholai Coal Power Plan:
The frequent number of failures at the number one coal power generation machine of the Norochcholai Coal Power Plant is something that cannot be accepted, Power and Renewable Energy Minister Ranjith Siyambalapitiya said.
He added that coal power generation machine baring number one, has broken down on 37 occasions due to various technical reasons since the installation.
“This situation cannot be considered as normal,” he said.
However he noted that this is the first ever coal power generation machine installed in the country and therefore, there is a room for having several shortcomings due to the lack of experience in the coal power generation.
He added that this particular machine, which has broken down again for the 37th time, will be back in operation within next two days. “Besides,the number three coal power generation machine, which is being serviced at present is expected to be back in operation today. This machine was shut down during the New Year period for servicing purposes,”the Minister said.
