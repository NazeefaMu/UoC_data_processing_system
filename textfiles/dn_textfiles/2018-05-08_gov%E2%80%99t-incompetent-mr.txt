Gov’t. is incompetent: MR

Former President Mahinda Rajapaksa yesterday said the present government is so incompetent that it cannot even govern a Grama Niladari division.
He said the country has become a police state under the UNP rule and the police has degenerated to such a low level that it now provides security to the weddings of underworld gangsters.
The former President was addressing the Sri Lanka PoduJana Peramuna (SLPP) May Day rally at the Samanagala grounds in Galle yesterday. A large crowd representing the SLPP and its allied parties participated in the rally.
“Not a single investor is interested in Sri Lanka today. Investors are leaving the country. Many are eagerly awaiting till the end of this government to make their investment in the country,” he said.
