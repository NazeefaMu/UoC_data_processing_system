Christmas cake mixing on the hills

The cool breeze in the air these days is mixed with the aroma of raisins, sultanas, currants, cherries, cranberries, prunes and figs complimented with high Spirits, honey are clear signs that winter wonderland is less than two months away. With the Christmas spirit already making their way into people’s hearts and souls, Amaya Hills Kandy is also getting into the Christmas feel with their traditional Christmas Cake Mixing ceremony.
The annual Amaya Hills Christmas Cake mixing took place recently with all the hotel chefs, management and of course the wonderful in-house guests who love age old Christmas traditions celebrated around the world.
Pictures show the guests having a great time mixing up all the ingredients for the cake.
