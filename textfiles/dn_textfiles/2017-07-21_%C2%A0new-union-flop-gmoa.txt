New union, a flop-GMOA

Only 45 doctors out of 18,000 doctors in the country turned up for the new 'doctors' trade union' the GMOA said.
Those 45 doctors were sacked from the Government Medical Officers' Association (GMOA) on disciplinary grounds, GMOA Secretary Dr. Haritha Aluthge said.
The GMOA Secretary said the total number of participants was around 80 and apart from 45 doctors all the others were representatives from multinational drug companies which are involved in the drug mafia. Photographs of the event will be released to media as proof, he said.
