Bacteria contaminating Rajangana reservoir

Resulting from the unwarranted utilisation of chemical fertiliser containing Nitrogen and Phosphorous, the water in the Rajangana reservoir is rapidly contaminating. The colour of the tank water is changing to green and a foul odour is emanating from the tank. It is learnt that the users of the tank have become sick, in addition to a negative effect on the fish population.
Irrigation Minister Duminda Dissanayake, visiting the Rajangane reservoir site accompanied by officials, gathered first-hand information about the matter. Irrigation Director General Mohanaraja, Anuradhapura Zonal Irrigation Director Prannade Silva joined the minister. The minister instructed officials to take prompt action to investigate into the water contamination issue and take action to revive the reservoir containing 86,000 a.f of water.
Senior lecturer Wasanthasena Welianga of the Biological Studies Department of the Rajarata University said the infection of a bacteria called ‘microcystins’ is the cause for the contamination and the colour changing of the Rajangana tank water. The bacteria prevent sunlight from entering through the water into the interior which dwindles the oxygen quantity in the water. This leads to the destruction of fish and aquatic plants in the water, originating a bad odour sans oxygen. The waste being disposed of by the bacteria affects the nervous system and liver of humans. The bacteria are about 3 billion years old.
The main cause for bacteria spread is the overuse of chemical fertiliser containing Nitrogen and Phosphorous, Dr. Welianga said.
