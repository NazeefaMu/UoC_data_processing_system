Cusco EZY Racing Aims at Podium in Young’s home race: Drives new Cusco EZY Racing car at this weekend’s New Zealand Rally

 
Whangarai, New Zealand: 2015’s Production Cup Champions, Cusco EZY Racing were seen revealing their new car with the 23-year- old Champion Mike Young beside it on Tuesday here in Whangarai. Sri Lankan based EZY Racing who grew in International Stature from their Partnership with Japan based racing Giant Cusco, released digital images of their 2016 APRC challenger a fortnight ago.
Kiwi driver, Mike Young who is a Double APRC Production Cup Winner and 2015 series runner-up, will carry local hopes of a podium this weekend as he looks for advantage on home gravel.
Young who has been preparing for his 2016 campaign by working on his personal fitness and driving skills got his 2016 rally hopes off to a great sprint by winning the opening round of the West Australia Rally Championship, held near Perth last weekend.
Driving for his second year with the Sri Lankan motor racing team, EZY Racing, Young will be provided an upgraded and lighter version of the Subaru WRX, engineered by Cusco to keep his Championship Challenge alive with the much faster MRF Skoda’s.

Young, sharing his excitement on the new car said “The Cusco prepared Subaru WRX Rally car powered by EZY Racing is lighter, giving us confidence for another great season”.
With the Rally Season Due to be kicked off today eveining (April 29) in central Whangarei,the 275 kilometer Rally will see a mixture of experienced and young drivers such as former FIA Asia Pacific Rally Champion Gaurav Gill from MRF SKODA Team and other younger contenders like Mike Young and Fabian Kreim. The event ranges over 275 kilometers.
“It is great to be back in New Zealand for my home rally – a rally I look forward to every year given my familiarity with the roads of Whangarei.” commented Young. “I’m sure it will be a competitive event against the new Skoda cars, but I’m looking forward to the challenge.
The 2015 Championship winners MRF Skoda team are expected to release the SKODA Fabia R5’s, a much faster variant to what was seen in 2015.
Commenting on his team’s chances, Founder of Sri Lanka’s only International Motor Racing Team, Shafraz Hamzadeen said “We need to keep our hopes very realistic. In 2015 we did see a few brilliant stage times from Mike (Young) which allowed us to win a stage or two.
This year we feel it is going to be even more difficult as the Skoda’s will be much faster with the lighter and faster R5’s. Our focus will be to be the best of the rest and hope that we would be able to capitalize on any issues that would crop up on the Skoda’s”.
EZY Racing whose Sri Lankan racing unit recently completed a successful stint in the gravel circuits, would be eagerly looking forward for a podium finish in Rally Whangarai, a fond location where they won their very first International podium in 2015.
