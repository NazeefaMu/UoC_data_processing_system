Cabinet nod for framework agreement on new Counter Terrorism Act

The Cabinet this week, approved a framework agreement on the new Counter Terrorism Act which would replace the former Prevention of Terrorism Act (PTA).
Co-Cabinet spokesperson Minister Rajitha Senaratne addressing the weekly Cabinet briefing yesterday, said the framework agreement had also been approved by the European Union.
“This would address new threats to security, especially in the international sphere,” Senaratne said.
The framework agreement which would be used as a base to draft the new Counter Terrorism Act, comes at a time when the EU takes a decision on whether to grant the GSP plus concession or not. The EU had earlier stipulated that the government act on drafting a new PTA in order to comply with GSP plus conditions.
Deputy Minister of Parliamentary Affairs and Mass Media, Karunaratne Paranawithana however stressed that the new Act complied with Sri Lankan conditions and did not necessarily give way to all EU demands. Minister Senaratne was of the view that the European Parliament would vote in favour of Sri Lanka as they usually worked on the recommendations of the EU Commission. The latter had ruled in favour of Sri Lanka.
