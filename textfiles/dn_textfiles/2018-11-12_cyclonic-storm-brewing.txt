Cyclonic storm brewing

The Meteorology Department yesterday warned that the deep depression over the southeast and adjoining central Bay of Bengal will intensify into cyclonic storm Gaja during the next 24 hours.
The Natural Hazards Early Warning Centre of the Department requested the naval and fishing community to be aware of the cyclonic storm and take precautions.
The forecast issued by the centre said the deep depression over the southeast and adjoining central Bay of Bengal moved west-northwestwards with a speed of 12 kmph during the past six hours, intensifying into cyclonic storm Gaja about 1,040 km northeast of Kankasanturai.
“It is very likely to intensify further into a severe cyclonic storm during the next 24 hours. It is very likely to move west-northwestwards during the next 36 hours and then west-southwestwards towards the north Tamil Nadu and south Andhra Pradesh coasts during the subsequent 48 hours,” the Meteorology Department said.
