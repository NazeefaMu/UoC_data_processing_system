St. Joseph’s lodge complaint against referee Dinka Peiris

St. Joseph’s College rugby authorities have lodged a complaint with the Sri Lanka Schools’ Rugby Football Association and the Sri Lanka Rugby Referees Society with regard to the 19 wrong decisions made against them by referee Dinka Peiris in their Singer ‘A’ division schools rugby match against Trinity College that took place on Friday 5 May at Havelock Park.
Dinuk de S.Wijeyeratne, chairman of St. Joseph’s College rugby advisory committee confirmed that a letter has been submitted with video evidence to the two respective governing bodies requesting an inquiry to be conducted on the 19 wrong calls made by referee Peiris in which Joes lost the match 25-30.
“A total of 19 mistakes were highlighted and it’s very unfortunate that these mistakes from a referee keep happening to Joes very often. We have been at the receiving end most of the time,” said Wijeyeratne. “Finally we have taken a decision to lodge a written complaint and submitted it yesterday to the Sri Lanka Schools’ Rugby Football Association and the Sri Lanka Rugby Referees Society with clear video evidence.”
“We are looking forward to a favourable reply from both parties,” Wijeratne said.
