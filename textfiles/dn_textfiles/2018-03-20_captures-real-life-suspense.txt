Captures real-life suspense

Taut with anxiety, ‘7 Days in Entebbe’ is a powerful example of how dramatizing a well-recorded chapter of history can still generate hard-hitting suspense.
On June 27, 1976, a plane carrying 248 passengers and 12 crew members from Tel Aviv to Paris was seized by four armed hijackers — two left-wing German revolutionaries and two Palestinians. The flight eventually ended up in Uganda, where the hostages were held in a decrepit abandoned airport. Their lives became points of leverage as their armed captors’ demand that Israel free jailed Palestinian militants was rejected, and the divided Israeli government debated how to pull off a seemingly impossible commando mission to rescue them.
The film re-creates the ticking-clock crisis in tones that are serious, but not too solemn to deliver well-timed thrills. Quickly backgrounding viewers unfamiliar with the origins of the Palestinian-Israeli conflict, the film moves to the capture of Air France Flight 139 almost before the passengers have loosened their seat belts.
