In addition, operational excellence, plant productivity focus and prudent cost efficiencies attributed further in expanding the profit margin to 32 percent.

The Group’s electricity generation for the period under review was 30 million Units (KWh) versus 14 million Units (KWh) generated in the previous year. The revenue expansion also resulted due to the completion of three rooftop solar power plants which has a combined capacity of 1.2 MW.

During the period, the company has also acquired Eco Green Solar Solutions (Pvt) Ltd, which has a 1 MW Solar Power permit in Beliaththa.

renewable energy in Sri Lanka by 2020, with an aim to increase that level up to 50% by 2030. Over the course of the coming year, the company will work to further consolidate operations across its plants while exploring new opportunities for growth and expansion.
