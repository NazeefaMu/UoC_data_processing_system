As determined during the first round, three research projects were undertaken by subject specialists on three broad areas viz. (i) Unfolding geo-strategic significance and assessing the regional security cooperation demands in the Bay of Bengal Region; (ii) Examine the current state of cooperation among the countries in the Bay of Bengal Region in maritime transportation, aviation and other sectors of economic activity; and(iii)Potential for developing Trincomalee as a regional hub for shipping, aviation and other sectors of economic activity to serve the Bay of Bengal Region and develop a way forward for further enhancement of cooperation.
Based on this research work, three sessions were conducted with the participation of Indian, Japanese and Sri Lankan scholars with the participation of Mr. Rohan Masakorala, Dr Terney Pradeep Kumara, Commodore Y N Jayarathna, Admiral Dr. Jayanath Colombage, Ms. Darshana Baruah (Carnegie India) Captain Rohan Joseph and professor Go Ito(Japan). Papers were also presented by Dr. Dan Malaka Gunasekera, Sumith Nakandala, Rear Admiral Anwarul Islam(Bangladesh), Commodore Somen Banerjee (India), Dr. Naing Swe Oo (Myanmar) and Dr. Rani Mullen (ISAS-Singapore) on BIMSTEC and country perspectives on the Bay of Bengal Region on connectivity, security and other related issues
The Indian Ocean Region is home to nearly one-third of world’s population and is of high economic and strategic significance due to its location and traffic that passes through it. It is estimated that nearly half of world’s containers, one third of bulk cargo traffic and two thirds of oil shipments pass through the Indian Ocean.
Further, there is a shift in global economic weight and influence from the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans to Indo-Asia-Pacific. Rise of China to number two and India to number sixth position in the world economic order is a clear example of this shift. With a growing population in India and China, there will be a requirement to produce and trade more. Therefore, the Indian Ocean has become the key ocean for energy, trade and food security. These developments have led to a new interest in the freedom of navigation.
The Indian Ocean is part of global commons and many major trading nations such as the USA, Japan, China, South Korea, Australia and some a number of other countries have shown their interest in this ocean. There are also some politically and security-wise unstable states in the Indian Ocean, which add to the volatility of maritime security.
Also, presence of non-state actors such as pirates, terrorists, hijackers, IUU fishers, religious extremists, and smugglers of weapons/narcotics/humans, in some parts of the Indian Ocean make maritime security a complex scenario.
Occupying a central location in the Indian Ocean and having cordial relations with other states in the region, Sri Lanka has a unique advantage in bringing scholars, practitioners and think-tanks from across the Indo-Asia Pacific region to discuss a wide variety of topics such as connectivity, maritime domain awareness (MDA) and oceanology research, focusing on the Bay of Bengal Region.
The Pathfinder Foundation plans to conduct the next regional conference on maritime governance and security issues in the Indian Ocean in 2019.
