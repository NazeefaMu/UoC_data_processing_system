Aedas, KWA, project architects  for Colombo City Centre

 
 
Aedas, a multinational focused on architecture and design together with the award winning Colombo-based architectural and interior design firm KWA Architects were the project architects of Sri Lanka’s latest international shopping mall Colombo City Centre (CCC) that opened its doors to the public on September 19.
CCC, the latest buzz and excitement in the city, is a collaboration of Abans PLC and Next Story Group. The mall which is gaining popularity from almost all segments is part of a massive 48 storey mixed development towering above the Beira Lake waterfront with over a quarter of a million sqft of retail space, 600 plus parking slots, 164-room city hotel and 192 luxury apartments.
Talking on the occasion, project’s architects Simon Griffiths from Aedas with Thilan Koththigoda and Thushari Wijesundara from KWA Architects said, “We are delighted to see the first phase of Colombo City Centre Development come to such a wonderful completion and it is heart warming to see how the people of Colombo have embraced this latest addition to their city.’
The design from the outset has attempted to blend in with the urban context while including some features uniquely Sri Lankan. The car park screen inspired by traditional Sri Lankan weaving patterns features the colors of the Sri Lankan national flag and forms a unique identifying feature. “In general, the car park façade is one of the most featureless elements in a high-rise structure. But in this instance we used it to celebrate the Sri Lankan identity of the building,’ architects Griffiths and Koththigoda added. The developers invested more than 100 million rupees into improving and upgrading the streetscape around the Colombo City Centre development for the benefit of the general public. Colombo City Centre Mall also features Sri Lanka’s first large scale food court with outdoor dining areas with stunning waterfront and ocean views and a six screen cinema multiplex.
The projects division of Jones Lang LaSalle Lanka was the post contract project managers of the project and Sanken Construction was the main contractor along with a large group of sub consultants and sub-contractors.
KWA Architects is an award winning architectural and interior design firm based in Colombo. Aedas is a multinational architectural and design firm operating from 14 offices from Hong Kong to Los Angeles. With their extensive presence in China and South East Asia, they are at the cutting edge of the rapid development and growth of emerging markets, and use this experience and understanding, to provide design solutions that will meet the demands of Asia of the future.
