Clogard Fresh Blast Gel brings North and South together

Hemas Manufacturing Limited, makers of Clogard Fresh Blast Gel, used the season’s celebration to bring the people in the North and South closer in a truly fresh and novel endeavour.
Clogard Fresh Blast Gel opened communications during the season between the youth in the North and South. A location of the communication booth was the Cargills Tower in Jaffna and in the South it was the Manjary Store in Galle.
The booths enabled participants to engage in video conferencing with those in the other booth located right across the country. It was an amazing opportunity for the youth in the North to connect with their counterparts in the South. In Jaffna they wished the southerners in Tamil while from Galle the participants wished their new found Tamil friends in Sinhala.
Clogard Fresh Blast Gel is manufactured with a blend of natural ingredients using opta zinc technology to fight germs providing last-lasting fresh breath that brings confidence, especially to young people, when they have to interact closely with others.
Fiona Juriansz Munasinghe, Marketing Manager at Hemas Manufacturing commented “We are very proud and pleased to have successfully integrated the two communities across the country in a very novel activation.”
