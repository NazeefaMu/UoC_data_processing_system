Coomaraswamy to take action against CB staff for any wrongdoing

Central Bank Governor Dr.Indrajit Coomaraswamy said that he is ready to take necessary action against Central Bank staff, if proven conclusively that, they were involved in wrong doings regarding various ongoing inquiries on the EPF and other transactions.
The Central Bank Governor made the observation when he was cross examined by President’s Counsel Senior Additional Solicitor General Dappula de Livera, who led the evidence.
CBSL Governor Coomarasamy was yesterday summoned for the second day,by the Presidential Commission of inquiry to Investigate and Inquire into the Issuance of Treasury Bonds as the first evidence to the CB Treasury bond issue.
President’s Counsel Dappula de Livera questioned the CBSL Governor whether in terms of the mandate, he has initiated an inquiry in terms of Central Bank’s code of conduct.
Justifying as to why he did not go down the road of trying to start an inquiry when he took over, the Central Bank Governor said there was a considerable amount of unease among the Central Bank staff when he took office.
“I felt that the priority was stabilisation,” he pointed out to the Presidential Commission.
“The Central Bank has extremely important functions that are of national significance. So in my view, it was important to create conditions for the Central Bank to fulfill those functions,” he said.
“Having been a Central Bank employee myself for 15 years, I know the standards of the Central Bank, how they are recruited and how they are trained. It is an excellent staff despite despite having some issues,” the Central Bank Governor pointed out.
Coomaraswamy also said that he felt his primary objective was to create a conducive condition for the Central Bank staff to fulfill their duties.
Replying to a question posed by the Presidential Commission regarding the Cntral Bank’s Internal Audit Department, he said the Internal Audit Department has responded to the Auditor General who is in the process of conducting investigations on behalf of the COPE committee.
President’s Counsel Dappula de Livera then questioned Governor Coomaraswamy whether he is trying to tell the Presidential Commission that there are no wrong doers in the CB staff regarding the certain irregularities.
The Central Bank Governor said that he believes that there are a small number of wrong doers within the CB staff.
