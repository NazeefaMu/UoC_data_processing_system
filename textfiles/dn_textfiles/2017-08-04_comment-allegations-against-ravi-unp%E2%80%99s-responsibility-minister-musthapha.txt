Comment on allegations against Ravi UNP’s responsibility: Minister Musthapha

Local Government and Provincial Councils Minister Faiszer Musthapha yesterday, declining to comment on allegations against Minister Ravi Karunanayake, said that it is the responsibility of the UNP to react to them.
Minister Musthapha, responding to questions by journalists at a press conference at the SLFP Headquarters, said the SLFP would articulate its stance on the findings of Presidential Commission of Inquiry (PCoI) on the Bond issue once its proceedings are over.
“The commission is still sitting. I am a lawyer and President’s Counsel by profession. It is not ethical for me to make any statement at this stage. Let’s wait till the commission concludes its inquiry,” the minister said.
Finding himself in a swirl of questions, Musthapha replied, “In any government, there can be ‘thieves’. It has been the case with all successive governments in the country”.
Asked what would be the SLFP stance if a No Confidence Motion against Karunanayake was presented, Musthapha said it would be decided at that time.
The minister, however, highlighted that it was the President’s initiative to set up the Presidential Commission of Inquiry (PCoI) which paved the way for the latest revelations.
