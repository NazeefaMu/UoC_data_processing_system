South Africa Emerging Players  on top in first unofficial test

South Africa Emerging Players took a stranglehold of the first 4-day unofficial test when they bowled out Sri Lanka Emerging Players for 194 and take a first innings lead of 200 at the end of the second day at Chilaw Marians grounds Katunayake yesterday.
Replying to the South African first innings total of 394-9 declared, Sri Lanka were bundled out rather cheaply with only youngsters Sammu Ashan and Chamika Karunaratne making any sort of impression with a half-century apiece.
Sri Lanka lost their first six wickets for 66 before Ashan and Karunaratne figured in a seventh wicket partnership of 84 to lend some stability to the batting. Ashan was out for a fine innings of 51 made off 84 balls with eight fours and a six and Karunaratne went onto top score with 61 off 96 balls with nine fours. Five bowlers took two wickets apiece to share the spoils for South Africa.
Earlier in the day South Africa resuming at the overnight score of 318-7 reached 394-9 before closing their innings. Left-arm spinner Muthumudalige Pushpakumara was the pick of the Lankan bowlers finishing with six wickets for 126 off 43 overs. At stumps South Africa were 10-1 in their second innings with Pushpakumara picking up another scalp.
The match continues on its third day today.
