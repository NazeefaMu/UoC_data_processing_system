Appeal for financial help with kidney surgery

A.N. Chandrawathi of ‘Kumari,’ Babaranda North, Kottegoda, is suffering from end-stage renal failure. She is currently on haemodialysis and doctors treating her have recommended an urgent kidney transplant to save her life.
She is in need of an A positive, A negative, O positive, or O negative kidney to facilitate the surgery. The entire process is estimated to cost Rs. 2.5 million.
She does not have the funds to meet the medical expenses and requests philanthropists and the public to assist her cause by sending any financial contributions possible to facilitate the surgery.
All contributions should be remitted to account number 1-0004-11-0264-8 at the National Saving Bank, Matara branch. She also requests a kind donor willing to donate an ‘A positive’ kidney to contact her on mobile 0715 963676 or 0716 264717.
