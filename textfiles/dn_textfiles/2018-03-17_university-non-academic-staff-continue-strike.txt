University non-academic staff continue strike

The university non-academic staff yesterday decided to continue with their strike as their demands have not yet been considered by the government, University Trade Union Joint Committee president Edward Malwatte said yesterday.
Accordingly, the strike will continue for the 18th consecutive day today.
Malwatte said that they have decided to continue with the trade union action as they were unsatisfied with the outcome of the meeting held at the Prime Minister’s Office.
The meeting was held between the trade union members and government officials yesterday morning. Malwatte pointed out that no positive discussions were carried out at the meeting to rectify the issues they have cited.
“The decision to continue with the trade union action was taken at a meeting held by the University Trade Union Joint Committee last evening,” Malwatte also said.
The academic activities and day-to-day functions of universities are badly affected by the trade union action of the non academic staff of universities.
