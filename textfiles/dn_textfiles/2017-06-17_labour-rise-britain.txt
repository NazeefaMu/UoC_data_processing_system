Labour on the rise in Britain

British voters on June 8 dashed hopes of Prime Minister Theresa May to form a strong and stable Conservative Government to strengthen her hand at Brexit negotiations. Instead it elected a hung Parliament where the Conservative Party obtained 318 seats, 13 less than it had earlier. It received 42.45 percent of the vote against 39.99 for the Labour Party which increased its representation to 262, with an addition of 32new seats. The Scottish National Party obtained 35 seats, a reduction of 19 seats in the new Parliament.
Since 326 seats are required for a majority in the House no party could form a stable government. Despite the inability to obtain an absolute majority Prime Minister May has now formed a coalition government with the small Democratic Union Party of Northern Ireland which won 10 seats in Parliament.
What does the election results signify? First of all it signifies the weakening of the Conservative Party vote base and the rise of the Labour Party under its new Leader, trade unionist and human rights activist Jeremy Corbyn. Corbyn has been in Parliament since 1983. It is much more than a general sift to Labour for Corbyn has steered the party away from its former neo-liberal agenda.
Labour Party, though unable to obtain a working majority in Parliament seems to be the principal victor at the election. It received its highest vote share since 2006. The strengthening of the Labour Party is attributed to the large youth vote. In that sense it has a good prospect at the next General election, which may not be distant in view of the unstable nature of the new government of Theresa May.
Labour under Corbyn campaigned against the austerity programme of the government, privatization, and neo-liberal policies. It called for universal healthcare coverage, increased access to higher education, nationalization of critical entities, free college tuition, free lunch to all primary and pre-schoolchildren, economic security for workers, massive expansion of public housing, higher taxation of corporations and the richest 5 percent et al.
Among its proposals were also an increase of the minimum wage of workers to US $ 15 per hour, empowerment of trade unions, free pre-school education and the reduction of the voting age to 16.
It is apparent that the Labour Manifesto has much in common with the general principles of socialist development and its endorsement by an increasing segment of the British voters, especially the young ones testifies to the viability of the socialist dream which has not lost its glamour despite the demise of the Soviet Union and the subsequent developments. On the other hand, the world economic and financial crisis of 2008 in which Britain was severely affected and the failure of neo-liberalism to overcome the crisis so far has strengthened the search for an alternative to capitalist development.
Corbin’s agenda was highly critical of the participation of the United Kingdom in the aggressive unilateral wars unleashed by Washington since the terrorist attack on the World Trade Center. Corbyn had openly criticized British collaboration in those wars in Afghanistan, Libya and Syria from the inception. He has promised to ensure a more secure Britain through a radical change in the foreign policy instead of unleashing a “war on terror” in the Bush or Trump style.
France elects new Parliament
French President Macron’s Forward Movement party seems to obtain a sweeping majority at the French elections. In the first round that was concluded his party won 32 percent of the vote as against 21.2 percent for the Republican Party. Socialists received only 10 percent while the Far Right National Front of Le Pen received 13.9 percent, a reduction by 4 million the number of votes it received at the Presidential election a month ago. One thing, however, is clear. That is the traditional parties are on their way to death. Even the Far Left received more votes (14 percent) than the Socialists (13 percent).
It is estimated that after the second round of the elections scheduled for June 18 President Macron’s Forward Movement Party would get 400-440 seats in the 577 seat Parliament and the Republicans would get about 100 with the rest going to minor parties.
In any case, voters have not shown much enthusiasm in the Parliamentary election. Less than 50 percent have gone to the polls to vote. This is in contrast to the last three Parliamentary elections where the voter turnout was 61 percent.
