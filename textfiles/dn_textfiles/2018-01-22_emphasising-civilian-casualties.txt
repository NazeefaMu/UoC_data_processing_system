Emphasising on civilian casualties

In the course of a debate in the House of Lords, Lord Naseby disclosed some vital information regarding the number of civilian causalities of the war between Sri Lankan Security Forces and the LTTE. According to the information available to the United Nations, the number of civilian deaths could have been about 40,000. The estimates of the United Nations are based on the Report of the Secretary General’s Panel of Experts (PoE) on accountability in Sri Lanka in March 2011 and subsequent OHCHR investigation on Sri Lanka (OISL).
The position of the government of Sri Lanka is that the Sri Lankan government’s military operation against the LTTE was a humanitarian operation for the restoration of peace in Sri Lanka. The government had pointed out that the civilian death toll was in the region of 7,000 - 8,000 and argued that the Sri Lankan government was not responsible for civilian deaths and it is the violations of human rights and humanitarian law by the LTTE which caused the civilian deaths.
The Sri Lankan government appreciates very much the hard work that Lord Naseby has done to obtain with much difficulty from the British Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) the wartime confidential dispatches sent by United Kingdom Defence Attaché in Colombo to the FCO. Sri Lankan President, by a letter dated November 2, has thanked Lord Naseby for assisting Sri Lanka to convince the United Nations authorities, especially the UNHRC in Geneva that the Sri Lankan government and its military had not committed serious human rights violations amounting to genocide or war crimes. However, the UK government and other states that sponsored the resolution 30/1 have not taken the contention of Lord Naseby seriously and they are of the view that the findings of the United Nations investigations cannot be rejected because they are based on credible information gathered from multiple sources of information during the final stages of the war. Their position is that the United Nations should not take recommendations made on the basis of the findings of a single individual seriously and they should insist on the Sri Lankan government to honour the commitments undertaken by the Sri Lankan government by co-sponsoring the resolutions of the UNHRC in Geneva.
If the Sri Lankan government as a co-sponsor finds that any amendments or corrections in the resolution 30/1 are necessary Sri Lanka has to bring to the attention of the UNHRC the reasons for making such changes. But, it appears that the other sponsors of the resolution 30/1 may not agree to review the resolution. Therefore, if the UNHRC insists that the Sri Lankan government should honour the commitment to establish a special tribunal envisaged in the resolution 30/1, the Sri Lankan government cannot ignore or postpone indefinitely taking necessary steps.
Regarding the requirement for including judges from foreign countries the Sri Lankan government may be able to convince the sponsors of the resolution that the judicial system in Sri Lanka is now free from political interference and capable of conducting a credible judicial investigation by a domestic tribunal.
Policy guiding the United Nations
In a statement issued to The Island newspaper (December 12) Lord Naseby states that the policy by which the United Nations is guided when it deals with states affected by terrorism is that “states must ensure that any measure taken to combat terrorism complies with their obligations under international law, in particular, international human rights law, international refugee law and international humanitarian law. The United Nations also insists on states to implement a credible accountability process for those responsible for serious violations and abuses and such accountability process contributes to safeguarding the reputation of those included within the military, who conducted themselves in an appropriate manner with honour and professionalism.”
A significant role has been assigned to the United Nations to intervene in civil wars because there is a tendency for the authoritarian states to disregard human rights and resort to excessive violence for suppressing anti-government insurgencies. Even after the end of a civil war, the United Nations has a responsibility to intervene in the state concerned for ensuring that necessary steps are taken by the parties for promoting reconciliation and lasting peace and creating a political economic and social environment conducive for peaceful coexistence among all parties to the conflict.
7,000 civilian deaths not a trivial matter
The dispatches by Col. Anton Gash, the former defence attaché of the British High Commission constitute a very valuable source of information to any investigator or tribunal which seeks to ascertain the truth regarding the number of civilians who died and under what circumstances they died.
Lord Naseby should be commended for sending the copies of the parts of the dispatches he obtained together with substantial corroborative evidence from many other sources to the Secretary-General of the United Nations and the human rights team at the UNHRC in Geneva. He is seeking their support for the correction of the misleading figures and information in the Darusman report and other sources regarding the civilian death toll.
However, Lord Naseby emphasizes that the death of even seven thousand civilians should not be regarded as a trivial matter. He says that whatever the number of civilian deaths that occurred during the last stage of the war, the Sri Lankan authorities should honour their commitment to the UNHRC by conducting credible investigations and thereafter proceed to prosecute any persons and officials against whom credible evidence is available. The material that Lord Naseby has discovered and the documents that he has with him regarding the manner in which the parties to the war, the Sri Lankan military forces and the LTTE conducted themselves during the war, may be valuable evidence before any tribunal.
Referring to the unlawful conduct of the LTTE during the last stage of the war, Lord Naseby observes that Tamil civilians were herded into a war zone against their will by the Tigers. In effect, this was a mass hostage situation and the Sri Lankan Armed Forces took action to release the Tamil civilians. Despite this position, the casualties remain remarkably low. He further observes that there is “no evidence to indicate that Sri Lankan Security Forces were directed by their government to break the principles of conducting operations in a way that was beyond the bounds of military necessity nor that Sri Lanka’s Armed Forces did not take due diligence to avoid civilian casualties by conducting their operations with regard to distinction and proportionality.”
National Unity Government has the political will
The national unity government of President Maithripala Sirisena and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe has shown the political will to implement the UNHRC Resolution 30/1 with the understanding that the United Nations is intervening only for the purpose of promoting reconciliation among all communities in Sri Lanka by bringing the attention of the Sri Lankan government to the various aspects of the reconciliation process such as accountability, human rights and good governance, that should necessarily follow after the end of the war. The leading nations that co-sponsored the resolution 30/1 have appreciated the substantial progress Sri Lanka has made by taking many steps in compliance with the resolution 30/1.
Most challenging task
The most challenging task for the government in the reconciliation process appears to be the drafting of a new constitution. The steering committee’s interim report based on the reports of the six sub-committees was presented to the Constitutional Assembly on September 21, 2017, which was subsequently debated in Parliament. The peace-loving people of this country who are yearning for durable peace hope that the final report of the Steering Committee together with the draft constitution will be submitted for approval of the Constitutional Assembly without delay.
