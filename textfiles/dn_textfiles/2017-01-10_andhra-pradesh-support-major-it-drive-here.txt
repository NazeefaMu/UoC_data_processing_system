Andhra Pradesh support for major IT drive here

The government is seeking the support of Andhra Pradesh for a major IT drive to enhance services using the internet.
In an effort to boost closer ties with southern states in India, India will help Sri Lanka to implement internet-based technologies for a major energy saving and water management drive, Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister Chandrababu Naidu said.
“There were two immediate projects identified.”One is how to go for LED bulbs, replacing all traditional street lamps with LED bulbs and control them from a single command centre. And the second project will be in the field of ground water management and real-time meter reading. These two can be done immediately.”
He further added that he was also eager to learn about the success story of Sri Lanka’s booming tourism and garment industries. (IH)
