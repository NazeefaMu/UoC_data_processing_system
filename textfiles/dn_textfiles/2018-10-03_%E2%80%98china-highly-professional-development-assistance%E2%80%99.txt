‘China highly professional  in development assistance’

China has been prompt and highly professional in the selection of projects and disbursement of funds, which otherwise was lengthy and time consuming in other multi-lateral and bi-lateral relationships, said Science, Technology, Research, Skills Development and Kandyan Heritage Minister Dr. Sarath Amunugama.
He was addressing an economic forum on the ‘Belt and Road Initiative’ held in Chengdu, China, recently.
As Sri Lanka was able to mobilise Chinese support in time, Sri Lanka was able to overcome the recent escalation of prices, he said.
He added that most developing countries have increased their debt burden in relation to international multi-lateral and bi-lateral lenders. China has played a positive role in suggesting a conversion of debt to equity in many of the projects that were launched with Chinese assistance, the minister said.
“The future will therefore, be more complex in the realization of investment for infrastructure development. While the World Bank, Asian Development Bank and AIIB have enhanced their lending capacity, many borrowers are inhibited by the debt ceilings imposed either by the IMF or by their own budgetary constraints. Recent developments in the areas of trade and commerce, with the imposition of new tariffs and trade embargos, will finally affect the development efforts of the poorer nations.
“I suggest that we appoint a high level group of eminent persons to examine ways and means of overcoming their debt difficulties,” said Minister Amunugama.
The minister said Sri Lanka is strategically located in South Asia and is known as the ‘Pearl of the Orient’. Chinese President Xi Jinping at the inaugural meeting of the Belt and Road initiative said ‘Sri Lanka is not only the Pearl of the Orient’ but also the ‘Pearl of the Belt and Road’ initiative, the minister added.
“Sri Lanka and China have had close and friendly relations since the establishment of the People’s Republic of China (PRC). We were the first country in South Asia to recognize the PRC established under Chairman Mao Zedong. Soon after that, we entered into the Rice-Rubber pact with China even though many other countries imposed embargos and isolated China. Our two countries have never lost sight of such solidarity and Sri Lanka is grateful to China for its help in varying fields, especially in infrastructure development,” the minister said.
He said China is Sri Lanka’s major bilateral donor partner. China has provided funds and expertise for many crucial infrastructure projects in Sri Lanka.
“China financed and constructed a new harbour in Hambantota, a new international airport in Mattala, Port City of Colombo where approximately 300 hectares of land is reclaimed from the sea, a 600 megawatt coal power plant in Norochcholai and several super highways which connect all parts of the country. Some super highways, especially the new highway to Kandy, is now under construction and the extension of the road and railway from Colombo to Hambantota is significant,” he said.
“All the more reason then, for all developing countries to act together, improve their infrastructure and productivity, and find new and efficient means of utilizing their natural and human resources.
“The ‘Belt and Road initiative’ (B & R) helps us with its emphasis on international solidarity, inter-connectivity and the best uses of our natural resources. At a time of growing instability and isolationism, the initiative tells us that all can win and no one should be left behind.
“We in Sri Lanka have benefitted from that initiative and would like to join all our fellow nations in helping the B & R initiative to grow for the benefit of all mankind,” the minister said.
