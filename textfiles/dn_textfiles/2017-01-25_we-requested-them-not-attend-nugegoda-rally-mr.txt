We requested them not to attend Nugegoda rally: MR

Former President Mahinda Rajapaksa yesterday said that the Ministers and Parliamentarians supporting the government who had promised to be on the Joint Opposition platform at the Nugegoda rally scheduled to be held on January 27, were advised by the JO members not to show up.
He said that a Chief Minister had told the media that the children of the Ministers and Parliamentarians who would be on the Joint Opposition’s stage on January 27, would have to languish in jail.
“The politicians have to face various obstacles, impediments But their children should not suffer in vain,”he said.
The former President said that the Joint Opposition members discussed this situation at length and decided to inform them not to participate at the January 27 rally. “They will extend their support to us while being a member of the present government,” he said.
