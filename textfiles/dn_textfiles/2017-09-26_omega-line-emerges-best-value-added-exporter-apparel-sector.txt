Omega Line emerges best value added exporter in apparel sector

Omega Line Pvt Ltd, a leading apparel manufacturer with a highly focused export-oriented strategy and part of globally renowned Italy-based Calzedonia S.p.A was yet again awarded the highest value added exporter in the apparel sector category at the recently held Presidential Export Awards.
Organised by the Sri Lanka Export Development Board (EDB), the 21st Presidential Export Awards was graced by chief guest President Maithripala Sirisena. Held at BMICH on September 14, the event recognized exporters who have made a major contribution to the country’s exports sector for 2016.
The company is no stranger to the awards also being recognized similarly for the year 2015. "We take great pride in being recognized for our continuous contribution to the country’s apparel industry and export sector as a whole," commented Felix A. Fernando, Director, Omega Line Ltd.
Omega Line Pvt Ltd is operated under the flagship of Calzedonia S.p.A in Italy which manufactures and specializes in women’s undergarments, stockings, nightdresses, socks and swimwear.
Other locally associated operated apparel companies include Badalgama-based Sirio Ltd, Alpha Apparels Ltd in Polgahawela, Benji Ltd in Bingiriya and Vavuniya Apparels in Vavuniya, all comprising a total workforce exceeding 12,000 employees.
Omega Line Pvt Ltd is a socially responsible company initiating many activities that uplift and enrich the lives of the people, with last year’s 'Sahanodayata Dawasak' being the first which saw a significant interest and engagement as many employees of Omega Line spent a whole day in nearly 40 orphanages and centers taking care of elders. This is just the first of many to come.
Calzedonia S.p.A has over 4,200 retail sales outlets in over 40 countries across Europe, Russia, Middle East, Asia and America and sells its products labelled with various brands such as Intimissimi, Calzedonia, Tezenis and Falconeri. The Presidential Export Awards was held under the leadership of EDB Chairperson and CEO Indira Malwatte with guidance of Minister of Development Strategies and International Trade Malik Samarawickrama and State Minister of International Trade Sujeewa Senasinghe.
The 21st Presidential Export Awards featured a total of 60 prestigious export awards, which consisted special overall awards, highest foreign exchange earners and sector-awards for best value added exporters.
