Govt will not realise budgetary targets - Vijitha

The 2016 budget introduced by the government is solely dependent on taxes for its income.
It will also increase the country's indebtedness, said JVP publicity secretary and parliamentarian Vijitha Herath. He said the government's estimated income is Rs. 2,047 billion and expenditure Rs. 2,787 billion.
"This amounted to a deficit of Rs. 740 billion.
These are only hypothetical targets which could not be attained," Herath said.
He said the government will not realise the expected income targets while expenditure too would escalate, forcing it to resort to supplementary estimates to fill the gap.
"Out of the estimated revenue of Rs. 2,047 billion, almost Rs. 1,584 billion is earned through taxes. The price reduction on goods and commodities was very negligible while many taxes had been introduced on the public. Everything from utilities like electricity and telephone charges would also increase heaping unbearable burdens on the masses," Herath said.
"Sri Lanka's total debt which was Rs. 7,390 billion end December 2014 increased by another Rs. 600 billion during the seven month period ending July 2015. This government too had obtained foreign loans at high rates of interest like the previous regime," he said.
Loans had been obtained despite the slump in oil prices in the world market, the MP said.
