US encourages SL to make public strategy to implement Resolution 30/1

The United States has appreciated the Government of Sri Lanka’s cooperation with the UN and relevant special procedure mandate holders in terms of the human rights situation, William J. Mozdzierz, the US representative said at the on-going session of the UN Human Rights Council (UNHRC) at Geneva. “Since September 2015, Sri Lanka has taken important steps toward implementing its key human rights, justice, and reconciliation commitments. In particular, we commend the government’s public consultations with civil society and victims across Sri Lanka”
We also recognize the joint efforts of President Sirisena, Prime Minister Wickremesinghe, and Opposition Leader Sampanthan in drafting a new, more inclusive and democratic constitution, passing legislation to establish an Office of Missing Persons, and ratifying the Convention on Enforced Disappearances.
These reconciliation processes are complex, but we had hoped to see greater and more sustained progress over the past 18 months.
While over 4,500 acres of land have been returned to private owners, many thousands of acres seized during the conflict period remain under military control.
