Army to release another 638 acres of northern land to owners on April 16

The Army will release 683 acres more currently occupied by the Military Forces in the Jaffna District. Accordingly, land in four Grama Niladhari Divisions including Myladdi area will be released to their original owners.
Army Spokesman Brigadier Sumith Atapattu said lands will be handed over to the Jaffna District Secretary on April 16, 2018.
He also said that the decision to hand over the lands was taken after verifying the original owners of the land.
Atapattu also said that the decision was reached after reviewing whether such a release would have any impact on the security of the area. Army personnel as of December 1,2017 have released a total of 55,510.58 acres of private and state land at Jaffna, Kilinochchi, Mullaittivu, Mannar and Vavuniya in the Northern Province and another 133.34 acres in Keppapilavu.
The Army commenced the gradual release of private property used by the Armed Forces after the conclusion of humanitarian operations in 2009.
Land release in the Northern Province was expedited on the directions of Army Commander Lt. General Mahesh Senanayake in line with the government’s policy of reconciliation and ethnic harmony.
