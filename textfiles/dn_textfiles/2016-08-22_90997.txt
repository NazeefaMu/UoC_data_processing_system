Young Lions in ruthless display
Sri Lanka U19 Youth team under a leader who led his team from the front and by example did extremely well on their tour of England concluded a few days ago winning both series of longer and shorter versions without much resistance from the English side disproving the belief that they too would face problems when playing in English conditions. They acclimatized to the cold and alien conditions in England faster than the other Sri Lankan teams that toured England around this period. Young Lions were so exceptional on this tour that they remained unbeaten after playing five matches against their English counterparts.
Sri Lanka U19s won the two-match Youth Test series 1-0 after Lahiru Kumara, stoutly-built seamer from Trinity College, Kandy completing an outstanding bowling effort with an eleven-wicket match-haul fired Sri Lanka U19 to a seven-wicket victory in the second and final Youth Test played at County Ground, Northampton. The young Lions after they got used to English conditions sooner than expected played so well in the first leg of their tour, the two-match Youth Test series that even in the first four-day Test Sri Lanka after following-on came back very strongly to force a stubborn draw in the end before their series-claimed victory in the following Youth Test.
It was England U19s first home defeat in a 4-day game after six years and it was the same opposition that defeated England on that occasion too in 2010.
England U19s, desperate for recording their first win against Sri Lanka since Lankans arrived in England went into the three-match youth ODI series seeking some consolation at least in the shorter format for which Sri Lanka were the favorites though. Sri Lanka U19s achieved an early lead in the series when they defeated England by a huge margin of 108 runs in the opening one-dayer with skipper Charith Asalanka playing the principal role in both departments.
Though the winning margin of the first match was the highest in the series, Lankans victory in the second match could be rated as the most incredible one in which their batsmen led by Avishka Fernando with a blistering hundred followed by Sammu Ashan’s match-winning innings helped their side overhaul England’s 300-plus target successfully thereby securing the series with an invincible lead of 2-0. England batted first posting an imposing 315 in their 50 overs with three batsmen completing 50-plus scores. Though 315 looked to be on the safer side for England to break the winning streak of the Lankans and stay alive in the series, Lankans needing a win to record their second successive series win on this tour got off to an excellent start and thereafter maintained a match-winning scoring rate keeping their wickets intact at the same time.
After Dilan Jayalath’s 34-ball 41 at the top, Avishka Fernando showing his talent as a classy batsman helped Sri Lanka reach 267 for four before he was unfortunately run-out for a well-compiled 96-ball 117 with 5 fours and a six in the 36th over. Avishka’s dismissal at a time Sri Lanka were cruising along brought Sammu Ashan to the middle that became an ideal replacement in the end as Sammu instead of panicking even when wickets started to crumble around him reverted to an unusual calmness with a bullish determination to carry his team over the line.
His rock-solid innings of 75-ball 77 not out after Avishka’s century sealed Lankans triumph with five balls and a wicket to spare.
Sri Lanka having won the Test series and already secured the one-day series maintaining a remarkable winning-streak away in England had nothing to loss when they got to the final match of their tour, the third and final youth ODI, but England’s intentions were very clear as they were desperate for recording their first win against Lankans on this tour by hook or crook. Sri Lanka knowing well of their intention batted first and amassed 300, thanks to the Avishka Fernando’s back-to-back ton, setting England with a challenging target. Though Sri Lanka overhauled England’s 300-plus total the other day after a great chase, England could not quite do it as they managed only 276 in reply awarding Sri Lanka a 3-0 clean-sweep in the series.
Individual stats of the Youth Test series
Olly Westbury of England topped the batting list with 282 runs at 94 including a century followed by Charith Asalanaka (224 at 56), George Bartlett (158 at 53) and Avishka Fernando (126 at 32). In the bowling, Lahiru Kumara capturing 13 wickets occupied the top spot followed by three Englishmen, GD Panayi (8 wickets), Amar Virdi (6 wickets) and ED Barnes (5 wickets).
Individual stats of the Youth ODI series
Avishka Fernando who played a major part in Lankan’s 3-0 one-day triumph spanking two glorious centuries led the batting list with 285 runs at an average close to hundred whilst maintaining a strike rate of over hundred. GT Hankins came second with 188 runs followed by Sammu Ashan (156 runs at an amazing 156), Charith Asalanka (127 at 42) and Dilan Jayalath (108 at 36). Ben Green of England who took 8 wickets became the most wicket-taker in the series whilst Lahiru Kumara (6 wickets), Damitha Silva (5 wickets) and Wanindu Hasaranga (5 wickets) occupied the next three spots in the bowling list.

Army SC U23 crowned 2016 U23 D1 T20 Champions
Army SC’s U23 team led by former Dharmasoka bowler, Yohan de Silva clinched 2016 U23 D1 T20 Championship when they beat the star-studded SSC U23 led by Ramesh Mendis, another Dharmasoka player of the same era, in the finals concluded at Keththarama on Sunday the 14th ending SSC’s glorious winning-streak in this tournament. Army U23 though missed the championship of the first leg of this U23 Tournament, the 2016 U23 D1 limited-over tournament at the last moment when they were beaten in the finals by Chilaw Marians, this time they made no mistake until they grabbed the T20 championship.
Army after they were sent in got off to a flying start as their top three, Ashan Randika (21), Leo Francisco (32) and Dilshan de Soyza (34) batted aggressively maintaining a scoring rate of over eight runs per over in the first 10 overs. This initiative helped them reach a healthy 158 after 20 overs. SSC skipper, Ramesh Mendis once again becoming the top wicket-taker captured 3 wickets conceding just 18 runs from his 4-over spell.
SSC chasing 159 to win soon succumbed to a pathetic position as they lost Minod Bhanuka, Rashmika Opatha and Kavindu Kulasekara even before they had reached double figures with just 12 runs on the board. However, skipper Ramesh Mendis who was the match winner in their semifinal clash against NCC got SSC back on track scoring a 43-ball 58 with two fours and three sixes, but his dismissal with the score at 105 in the 17th over made things difficult for SSC as they needed 54 more runs from just 19 balls with 4 wickets in hand.
After SSC’s last recognized batsman, Tharindu Rathnayake soon followed his captain to the pavilion, SSC innings did not last long as they were bowled out for a total of 132. Army bowlers, Nalin Perera, Nirmal Fernando and Dilshan de Soyza who shared six wickets among them at two apiece were instrumental in this remarkable victory as SSC’s formidable batting lineup would have easily chased down this modest target if not for the tight bowling of these three.
Army U23: 158/8 in 20 overs (Leo Francisco 32, Dilshan de Soyza 32*, Ramesh Mendis 3/18, T Wijesooriya 2/33)
SSC U23: 132 in 20 overs (Ramesh Mendis 58, Tharindu Rathnayake 20, Nalin Perera 2/21, Nirmal Fernando 2/20, Dilshan de Soyza 2/27)
