”They are dogs that have had a difficult trajectory, yes, but what we want to point out is not the history suffered from the past,but to prove that no matter what they have gone through, they can be great companions today and in the future!” Madalena Spinazzola, from pet-foodmaker PremieR Pet -- organizing the initiative with the tournament -- told the Brazil Open’s website.
