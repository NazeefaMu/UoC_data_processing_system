Boost for ornamental fish breeding

An export-oriented countrywide programme to promote ornamental fish breeding will be launched soon.
This is because ornamental fish has a big international demand, Fisheries, Aquatic Resources Development and Rural Economy State Minister Dilip Wedaarachchi said.
It has also been planned to set up exporters' and ornamental fish export zones at district level to facilitate this programme, he said.
The State Minister was addressing a workshop at the National Aquaculture Development Authority, recently, to prepare a strategic plan for the promotion of ornamental fish breeding industry.
State Minister Wedaarachchi said the workshop was a good omen for the development of the ornamental fish breeding industry since it would be a good forum to discuss problems and find solutions.
He said ornamental fish exports would also help boost the national economy. It would also be a good self-employment avenue for people in the villages. Coral reefs and aquatic plants too had a big demand internationally. As such, they could also deliberate on this subject too and arrive at decisions to promote this aspect, he added.
State Minister Wedaarachchi, who emphasised that they should team up with the private sector too to march forward in this direction, said he would call upon all to dedicate their efforts towards the development of the ornamental fish breeding industry.
