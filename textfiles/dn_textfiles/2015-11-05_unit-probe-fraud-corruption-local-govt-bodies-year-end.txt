Unit to probe fraud, corruption in local govt bodies by year end

A coordination unit to investigate fraud and corruption in local government bodies will be established by the end of this year, Provincial Councils and Local Government Minister Faizer Mustapha said.
The first discussion in this regard was held at the ministry yesterday with the participation of local government commissioners and heads of the Police Department and the Bribery and Corruption Commission. Minister Mustapha said the establishment of the unit would help implement good governance in the country.
