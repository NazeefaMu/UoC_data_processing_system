“According to Mathew”

 The Catholic Church wishes to inform the general public, especially our Catholic faithful, that the above mentioned film which will be shortly screened in Sri Lanka, does not refer in any way to a Catholic Priest.
The Catholic Church by its centuries old tradition, does not visualize a married clergy and this has been the tradition in the Church in Sri Lanka, states Rev. Fr. Edmund Thilekeratne, Director-Social Communications, Archdiocese of Colombo, in a release.
