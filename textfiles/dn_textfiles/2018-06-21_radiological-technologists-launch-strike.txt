Radiological technologists to launch strike

The Government Radiological Technologists Association (GRTA) will launch a trade union action from June 26 after staging a token strike on June 20 and 21 in the North Western Province, GRTA Secretary Dharmakeerthi Epa said.
According to Epa, trade union action is to be taken in order to get all the transfers reversed. Direct requests for Radiological examinations coming from the Kurunegala Teaching Hospital, Chilaw Hospital and other state hospitals located in the North Western Province will be rejected. Epa was addressing the media during a press conference held in Colombo, yesterday.
According to Epa, the transfers of Radiological technologists had been made to carry out the night workload of state hospitals in the North Western Province while having a control over the membership of the union. This is unreasonable, he said.
Now 22 have days passed since the union members started a work to rule campaign. There is no response from the relevant health authorities.
Therefore, the token strike and other trade union action will be taken, he added.
