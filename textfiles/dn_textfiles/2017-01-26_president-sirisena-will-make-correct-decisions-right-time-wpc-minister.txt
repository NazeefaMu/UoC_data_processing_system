President Sirisena will make correct decisions at right time: WPC Minister

President Sirisena will make correct decisions at the right time and the price reduction of lottery tickets was one of them, Western Provincial Council Minister Gamini Thilakasiri said.
The Joint Opposition (JO) seek to topple this government, but it will only be a dream, he said.
Addressing a media briefing in Colombo yesterday, he said this government will continue till 2020 and no one will be able to topple it.
Even though the JO will organise a rally in Nugegoda on January 27 with the aim of taking over the power by toppling this government, It will never happen and it is only an attempt to deceive people by giving false promises.
"The JO wants to bring a crowd and close down some roads and hold the rally on January 27. So many such rallies were in the past, he said.
"They also went on several "Pada Yathras” as well. At each one, they said they would topple the government. But nothing happened," he said.
He said MPs Dinesh Gunawardene, Wimal Weerawansa, Bandula Gunawardene, and Udaya Gammanpila organised these rallies. They are not SLFP members. This country has only two major parties. Nobody can emerge victorious by breaking a party. They can go on like this only for sometime.
He said that if the JO members do not continue with rallies at least ones in two months, they cannot survive. They also have to give people false promises. Otherwise they cannot continue.
Sri Jayawardenepura-Kotte Mayor Janaka Ranawaka said the SLFP got defeated because of the Rajapaksa’s domination. Basil Rajapaksa hijacked many ministries, and it was the major reason for the SLFP’s defeat.
Basil gave many World Bank contracts to his henchmen. The organising post of the new party had again given to the Basil Rajapaksa to destroy the SLFP, he said.
