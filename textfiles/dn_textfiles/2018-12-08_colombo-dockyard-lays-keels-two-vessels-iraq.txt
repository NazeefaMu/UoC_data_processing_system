Colombo Dockyard lays keels of two vessels for Iraq

Colombo Dockyard (CDPLC) laid the keel to commence shipbuilding work on the 60 m Buoy Tender Vessel and the 50 m Twin Hull Catamaran hull Pilot Station Vessel for General Company for Ports of Iraq (GCPI).
This is with regard to an agreement signed with Toyota Tsusho Corporation (TTC) of Japan. TTC is the Prime Contractor of GCPI for this project and CDPLC is TTC’s preferred Shipbuilder.
This is the first shipbuilding project from Sri Lanka to reach Iraq. The project also strengthens relations between Sri Lanka and Japan.
TTC and GCPI signed the Prime Contract on April 27 in Dubai for the project and subsequently, TTC signed the Sub Contract Agreement with CDPLC as their preferred Shipyard for the construction of the two vessels on May 2 in Japan. Since then, the development of the basic design engineering and detailed design engineering took place and from now on, the project will take off the ground with the arrival of steel plates and sections ordered.
At a challenging time where there is not much shipbuilding taking place in the world due to the recession in the shipbuilding and shipping markets, CDPLC was able to secure the Shipbuilding contract, which will continue till the third quarter of 2020.
Both the Pilot Station Vessel and the Buoy Tender Vessel will be constructed using modern technology and will be in accordance with the latest rules and regulations of the maritime industry. Both vessels will be classed to Nippon Kaiji Kyokai (ClassNK).
The Pilot Station Vessel is a twin hull Catamaran type vessel which will be used to transport pilots and provisions, to provide pilots with accommodation services and to provide station and necessary support for pilot boats. This is a 50m length vessel with a breadth of 18m and a depth of 6.1m. The vessel is driven by two powerful diesel engines and shall develop a speed of 14 knots. The vessel shall be fully air-conditioned and shall provide accommodation for 47 persons.
The Buoy Tender Vessel is designed to be operated to retrieve and launch marine navigation buoys, to provide repair and maintenance to marine navigation buoy, to transport marine navigation buoys and/or spare parts and to transport general cargo. This is a 60m length vessel with a breadth of 12m breadth and a depth of 4.6m. The vessel is driven by twin diesel engines and is capable of achieving a speed of 12 knots.
The vessel shall also be equipped with a Crane with a lifting capacity of 22tons. This vessel too provides fully air-conditioned living quarters for its complement of 29 persons.
The two vessels are to sail out of Colombo in August 2020.
