Bieber waits for Gomez to make it official

For Justin Bieber, the ball is in Selena Gomez's court as the Canadian singer is reportedly waiting on for Gomez to confirm whether or not they are "officially back together."
"Justin is doing great. Spending all week with Selena is the dream week for him. He is trying to take things slowly, but it hasn't really worked. He is too excited to spend time with her."
"The 'Sorry' hit-maker is waiting for Selena to tell him that they are officially back together. He doesn't feel any rush, because no doubt they are already emotionally back together," the source continued.
Earlier during the week, the 'Love Yourself' hit-maker and the 'Fetish hit-maker attended a church event at the Microsoft Theatre and then went to a private dinner at Morton's Steakhouse in downtown Los Angeles.
The 'Boyfriend' hit-maker is aware that he did wrong in the past and understands that the 25-year-old Gomez deserves better and can do anything to prove he can be a great boyfriend.
The former flames, whose rocky romance ended in 2014, have been seen catching up on numerous occasions together, including enjoying a vegan breakfast together as well as meeting up at each other's properties. ANI
