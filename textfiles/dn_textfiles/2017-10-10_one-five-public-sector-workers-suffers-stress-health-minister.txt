One in five public sector workers suffers from stress: Health Minister

 
One in every five Sri Lankan public sector employees suffers from stress, Health Minister Rajitha Senaratne said.
Minister Senaratne said this, referring to the statistics documented in the Mental Health Unit of the Health Ministry.
He added that the Health Ministry statistics reports an increase in the number of individuals who seek medical treatment for mental disorders.
The Minister said this while addressing a gathering after opening the Pearl Child Guidance Centre at Aluthgama, Moragolla recently.
Minister Senaratne pointed out that mental stress and mental disorders have increased due to problems faced in offices and homes.
Busy and competitive lifestyle has also led to this situation. The impact of this negative trend is on the entire society. 
Children's mental health should be improved. It is the duty of all sectors to provide all required facilities for children with special needs and to ensure their safety while looking after them well, the Minister added.
