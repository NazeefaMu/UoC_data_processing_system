Days of depending on US are over- Pakistan PM

PAKISTAN: Pakistani Prime Minister Shahid Khaqan Abbasi has said the days of Islamabad's dependence on Washington to meet its military requirements have ended.
In an interview to Arab News, published on Monday, the Prime Minister said the world should recognise Pakistan’s efforts in fighting the “world’s war” on terror. “If one source dries up, we have no option but to go to another source. It may cost more, it may consume more resources, but we have to fight that war, and that’s what we emphasised to all the people that we met.”
“We have major US weapons systems in our military, but we’ve also diversified (our arsenal). We have Chinese and European systems. Recently, for the first time we inducted Russian attack helicopters,” Abbasi said.
Responding to a question, the Prime Minister said that US’ newly devised policy to include India for peace-building in Afghanistan will be detrimental for the region.
“We don’t believe that injecting India into the Pakistan-US relationship will help resolve anything, especially in Afghanistan, where we don’t see any role for India. India has a relationship with the US, and that is between them and the US,” Abbasi said.
He added that Pakistan wants an “equal relationship or partnership with the US, like every other nation” and wants to work with Washington in resolving regional and global issues ranging from the “economy to nuclear matters”.
He said that in his speech at the United Nations General Assembly and side meetings, he stressed that nobody wants peace in Afghanistan more than Pakistan.
“We’re partners in the war on terror, and that’s what we emphasised. We emphasised to everybody we met (at the UNGA) that nobody wants peace in Afghanistan more than Pakistan”. Abbasi said that in the recently held meeting between Foreign Minister Khawaja Asif and US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, Asif told his counterpart that Islamabad pursues a zero-tolerance approach to “all terrorist and militant groups”. - IANS
