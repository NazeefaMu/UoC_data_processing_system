The Sri Lanka Institute of Marketing (SLIM) in collaboration with the University of Ruhuna and INDECOS, commenced Fish Bonanza Phase II under the CSR project, ‘SLIM Gamata Marketing’ at the SLIM Matara branch with over 100 enthusiastic women entrepreneurs in the Southern Province participating.

The Project Chair Kaushala Amarasekara, other distinguished guests and the staff of SLIM were also present at the ceremony.
The project was launched by SLIM in collaboration with the Department of Food Science and Technology of the Faculty of Agriculture at the University of Ruhuna and the Institute for Development of Community Strengths (INDECOS). HNB Grameen came on board as the Financial Partner of this project.
As the national body for marketing, the Sri Lanka Institute of Marketing has identified a requirement for its intervention to promote the marketing philosophy among SMEs, rural enterprises and new entrepreneurs. This year ‘Gamata Marketing’ focuses on the fishing communities in Matara through ‘Fish Bonanza’. Pradeep Edward, the President – SLIM and CEO of Lanka Hospitals Diagnostics stated, “As the leading institute for marketing in Sri Lanka, SLIM is determined to elevate the status of marketing in the country by producing professional marketers in country and bringing out their hidden talents. Here at SLIM we also stress upon social responsibility in our actions to uplift the economy and create a better society. SLIM has hence embarked on a CSR program branded ‘Gamata Marketing’, which focuses on the society, economy and environment of the country.”
Roshan Fernando, Vice President – SLIM, added, “’Gamata Marketing’ was launched by SLIM with the aim of empowering the regional SMEs on marketing principles and the means by which to apply them effectively and efficiently to further develop their businesses. The project focuses on helping new entrepreneurs to compete in the market by delivering specific products and services to a wider market.”
Kaushala Amarasekara, the Project Chairperson of Gamata Marketing said,“The latest endeavour by SLIM, ‘Gamata Marketing’ aims to identify and uplift unseen entrepreneurs in rural areas and emphasize the importance of marketing. Women play a vital role as entrepreneurs in this society.”
‘Gamata Marketing’ creates an opportunity to provide awareness to the rural stakeholders about the importance of marketing and its benefits to all individuals and thereby to the society. The project will bridge the gap between rural upcoming entrepreneurs and SLIM, which in turn will open a whole new world to the upcoming entrepreneurs.
