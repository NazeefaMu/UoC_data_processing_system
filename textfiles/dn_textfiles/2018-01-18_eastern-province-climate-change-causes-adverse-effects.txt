Eastern Province climate change causes adverse effects

The climate of the Eastern Province has changed suddenly immediately after the rains. As a result, the people in this region are suffering from heavy cough, cold and slight fever.
The number of patients seeking OPD treatment has considerably increased.
Small children and old people above 70 have been badly affected. During the day the temperature is very awful and during the night theirs is a heavy fall of dew.
As a result of this climate change the farmers of Maha season complained that there is a heavy damage to paddy crops with increase of pests and diseases.
Meanwhile, the public residing in the coastal areas of the Ampara District have requested the Health Department officials to eradicate the mosquitoes which are fast spreading especially after the rains. Immediately after the rains, the low laying areas in the coastal belt are inundated with water which is conducive to the propagation of Dengue mosquitoes.
Garbage have been dumped in the wayside drainage and the flow of water in the drainage channels is blocked. The water in the drainage is not flowing which results in stagnation.
The public in these areas request the Health Department to eradicate the spread of Dengue mosquitoes without further delay.
