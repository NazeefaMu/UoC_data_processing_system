Royal College drives innovation through Spark 2018 powered by Dialog

Royal College presents Spark 2018 powered by Dialog, a platform and exhibition aimed towards fostering imagination, invention and innovation amongst the youth in Sri Lanka. Towards spearheading a culture of innovation, Royal College Colombo in collaboration with Dialog Axiata PLC, Sri Lanka’s premier connectivity provider, has identified the need to inspire the next generation on the value of invention and the power of innovation at an early age.
Being the first innovation exhibition of scale and magnitude to be held in the country, Spark 2018, will take center stage from 25th to 28th September 2018 at the Royal College premises and will be open to the public from 9.00am to 3.30pm, free of charge.
According to the 2018 edition of the Global Innovation Index carried out by Cornell University and INSEAD, Sri Lanka was ranked 88th out of 126 countries in terms of innovation performance. With innovation being a key driving force for our growing economy, there is a renewed need to prioritise action and foster new sources of innovation-driven growth that will gear the future of Sri Lanka.
Taking an all-encompassing approach to the exhibition, the organisers, Royal College conducted a series of seminars and workshops for students, teachers and parents, subsequently to be followed by expert panel forums. The workshops and forums will help students further develop skills, together with a mechanism to reward and recognise participants for early stage concepts until they have finalised their end products and projects.
The exhibition will be held under several categories such as Food & Agriculture, ICT and Electronics (Education and Entertainment Included), Home Technology and Appliances, Consumer Goods, Clothing and Fashion, Transportation, Green Technology and Energy and Sports, Games and Toys. B.A. Abeyrathna, Principal of Royal College said, “We are pleased to introduce, Spark 2018, which will provide a platform for young skilled talent in-country to showcase innovations and how their enterprising inventions can help change and impact communities.
The national significance of Spark 2018 has encouraged endorsements by the Presidential Secretariat, the Prime Minister’s Office, the Ministry of Education, the Ministry of Science, Technology & Research and the Ministry of Finance and Mass Media.”
In addition to over 400 exhibits from students across the Island, Spark 2018 will also host the ‘Top 10 National Inventions’, which were selected at an island-wide competition organised by Sri Lanka Inventors Commission, the apex body to promote innovation among the citizens of Sri Lanka. Dialog will also host a dedicated Future Pavilion to engage and excite audiences and the Sri Lanka Tri-Forces will display some of their key innovations.
Shayam Majeed, Group Chief Corporate Officer, Dialog Axiata PLC said, “Keeping with our mantra of delivering ‘The Future.Today.’, Dialog is proud to power Spark 2018 to drive innovation fueled growth amongst the youth in Sri Lanka.”
Spark 2018 is also honoured to have Elephant House as the Official Food & Beverage Partner, and National Lotteries Board, Development Lotteries Board, Microsoft and Softwave as Co-Sponsors.
