Barking deer freed from poacher’s trap

An injured ‘barking deer’ which had been caught in a poacher’s trap was rescued by the Uragahasmanhandiya Police and handed over to Wildlife officials last Tuesday.
The deer’s antlers had been injured when it was caught between iron rods and the police officers exerted great effort to free it, said Uragahasmanhandiya Crime Division OIC Inspector Vijith Jayantha.
Wildlife officials who arrived at the police station to inspect the deer however said they could not take the deer with them as they had no veterinarian to treat the animal.
The police stated that they had to keep the deer at the station for close to six hours for this reason.
The barking deer which is a species endemic to Sri Lanka, has been mostly limited to the areas of Karandeniya and Uragahasmanhandiya.
In recent times however, there has been an increasing decline in the barking deer population and the species is at present an endangered species, said Wildlife officials.
There are less than 100 barking deer in the wild at present.
