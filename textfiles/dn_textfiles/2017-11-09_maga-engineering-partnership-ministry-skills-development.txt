Maga Engineering in partnership with Ministry of Skills Development

A leading construction company in Sri Lanka, Maga Engineering entered into an agreement with the Ministry of Skills Development and Vocational Training to provide training to 375 construction craftsmen under the Ministry's Employment Linked Training Programme (ELTP). The training programme is funded by the World Bank and Asian Development Bank.
The programme will be specially tailored to address the needs of the construction industry and fulfill the skill and knowledge gaps of construction craftsmen. It will be a practical-oriented programme which aims to give the selected applicants theoretical knowledge on their particular craft coupled with practical on-the-job training sessions.
The participants for the program will be screened based on their aptitude and their competencies will then be developed in a holistic manner.
Under this programme, 50 Reinforcement Craftsmen will be trained at Maga's constructions projects under the guidance of experienced and qualified resource personnel.
Upon successful completion of the programme, the participants will be awarded with National Vocational Qualification (NVQ) Level 3 certification, accredited by the Tertiary and Vocational Education Commission of Sri Lanka.
Commenting on the programme, Chairman and Managing Director of Maga Engineering, M.G. Kularatne said, “We are thankful to the Ministry of Skills Development and Vocational Training for this great initiative. In the fast evolving construction industry, there is a grave need for skilled craftsmen and Maga is proud to play a lead role in attracting and developing more youth through public-private partnerships such as this, which is the way forward.”
The training programme aims to serve social objectives by channeling the potential and strength of youth in Sri Lanka to produce a construction workforce capable of delivering world class results.Upon successful completion, the participants will have the opportunity to find employment within the company and will be able to independently handle site work and supervisory operations.
The training program will be launched this month and will be completed within one year.
