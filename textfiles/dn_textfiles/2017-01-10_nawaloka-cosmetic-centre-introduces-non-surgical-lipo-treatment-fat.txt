Nawaloka Cosmetic Centre introduces non-surgical lipo treatment for fat burning

In a bid to address a growing health issue in the country, Nawaloka Hospital’s skincare and Cosmetic Centre announced the introduction of 3D-lipo treatment, a multi-platform technology which offers a powerful non-surgical alternative to liposuction with the addition of skin tightening and cellulite reduction modalities. Nawaloka Skincare and Cosmetic Centre consists of a team of experienced and skilled consultants and support staff who go through rigorous training to provide best possible services to clients.
Commenting on the procedure Dr Ashwini Rajan - Head of Nawaloka Skincare and Cosmetic Centre, “Unlike other Lipo Systems, the 3D lipo permanently destroys the fat cells. It offers immediate long term results painlessly and safely. Conventional weight loss journey leaves patients with little support or options other than diet, exercise and traditional surgery. We are happy to offer our clients this method which provides a significant advantage over existing methods.”
Given the changing lifestyles and dietary habits, obesity has become a prevalent condition in Sri Lanka.
The Ceylon Medical Journal estimates the prevalence of obesity as being 20% in males and a staggering 36.5% in females in Sri Lanka. In this context, 3D-lipo treatment is a safe, convenient and an affordable method to achieving a healthier body shape.
The 3D-lipo system gives clients several options and combinations to target and treat stubborn fat areas and cellulite.
These non-invasive treatments will help clients achieve positive results when combined with a healthy lifestyle. The fourfold treatment uses low-frequency ultra sounds to break apart fat cells and radio frequency as well as vacuum therapy to tighten skin.
“Each treatment takes about 30 to 60 minutes and we set each session apart by a week or two to ensure best possible results,” Dr Rajan said. Generally, 3D-lipo treatment produces positive results within 6 to 8 weeks.
