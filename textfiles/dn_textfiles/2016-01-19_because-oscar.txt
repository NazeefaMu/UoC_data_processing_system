Because OSCAR

Once again, it is the AWARDS season. Despite how wonderful the summer was, this is the movie-goers favourite season! The Golden Globes was held a few days back and we all were able to catch a glimpse of how these years Academy Awards, or "Oscars" will be like.
Yes, it is time to call those bets, grab your popcorn, download pirated DVD screeners, and of course argue with your movie buddies. Because the hype is back!
Cinephiles all over the world tune in gripping their hair, gritting their teeth rooting for their favourites and hoping they would take the Award home tonight! So here is a little trivia your way as you sit down for Oscar night on February 28.
The Oscar award is a replica of the actor Emilio Fernandez who posed nude for the creation of the statuette. It was the art director Cedric Gibbons who supervised the design of the statuette in 1929.
Oscars are officially known as the "Academy Award of Merit", yet it is better known as "Oscars", a nickname given by the Academy Librarian on behalf of the statue that resembles her uncle. The statue being nude, it is a little disturbing.
The statuette is 13 1/2 inches in height, and weighs 8 1/2 pounds- which is almost the size of a Barbie doll.
Being made of Metal, the statuette is unbreakable.
The original statuettes were gold plated bronze, but later they resorted to a pewter like alloy, plated with 24 karat gold.
During the World War II, due to metal shortage the Academy presented awards made of Painted plaster for three years, yet after the war the winners were allowed to redeem new gold plated metal statuettes.
In the year 2000, a shipment of 50 Oscars was stolen from the dock. Since then, they are delivered by a special Flight.
The Statuettes are made one year in advance, and flown to LA with maximum security, and stored in the Academy vault until the Oscar season arrives.
All the nominees' names are engraved on metal plates, and after the ceremony the winners can get their plate mounted on the award.
Oscar is the man who was lucky enough to be kissed by all of the Hollywood's heart throbs. Except he was made out of metal and gold.
Meryl Streep, Kate Winslet and several others keep their Oscars in their bathrooms in order to remind themselves of who they truly are.
Over the course of time several winners have refused to accept Oscars. Marlon Brando from "The Godfather" refused his award due to the discrimination of Native American communities during film making. A certain Native American Ms. Littlefeather was allowed to speak on behalf of him.
It is illegal to sell an Oscar, unless the Academy refuses to purchase it back at the prize of 1 USD. This happened after Michael Jackson bought and Oscar for 1 Million.
When an Oscar is handed to a lucky winner, the presenter is not allowed to say, "And the winner is ..." They must say, "And the Oscar goes to ..."
Walt Disney has won the most Oscars: which is 26.
The most awards won by a movie in all time is 11 awards. Three movies managed to bag the title: The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (2003), Titanic (1997), and Ben Hur (1959).
The youngest ever Oscar winner was Tatum O'Neal, 10, for Paper Moon (1973); the oldest was Christopher Plummer, 82, Beginners (2011).
