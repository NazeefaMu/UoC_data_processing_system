Conflict of Interest in issuance of primary dealer license to Perpetual Treasuries in 2013

There had been a conflict of interest in respective of the issuance of a primary dealer license to the Perpetual Treasuries (Pvt) Limited in 2013, the Presidential Commission on the Treasury Bond issue yesterday observed.
Referring to a question posed by former MP Rosy Senanayake at the COPE inquiries on the bond issue, the Commission asked former SPD D.Nanayakkara whether he was aware that former CBSL Governor Ajit Nivard Cabraal’s sister was a board member of the Perpetual Capital Holdings (Pvt) Limited.
It was brought to light by Supreme Court Justice P. Jayawardane that former CBSL Governor Cabraal had successfully dodged Rosy Senanayake’s question with a reply “No it was not a Primary Dealer and this is where you have missed the point.”
It was also observed that the Public Debt Department has not been concerned about the track record of the full shareholder of the Perpetual Treasuries (Pvt) Limited when issuing Primary Dealers’s license to it.The Perpetual Asset Management (Pvt) Limited, which is the full shareholder, has recorded a net loss of 2.8 billion as to March 31, 2012. The Commission also questioned former SPD Nanayakkara on what guarantee the PDD issued the newly established company which only fulfilled the minimum requirement of Rs.300 million deposited in a current account Nanayakkara replied the PDD was only concerned about the Capital 3 billion. The Commission also observed that one Renuka Group to which all the unquoted shares of the Perpetual Asset Management (Pvt) Limited belongs, is famously owned by former CBSL Governor Ajit Nivad Cabral’s family.
Perpetual Capital Holdings (Pvt) Limited, the main holding company of the Perpetual Group of Companies owned by Jeffory Alosiyus and Arjun Alosiyus, is the mother company of the Perpetual Treasuries (Pvt) Limited. The Perpetual Treasuries (Pvt) Limited has applied for a Primary Dealers’ license in 2013, when Nanayakkara was the Superintendent of the Public Debt Department.
These observations were triggered by a statement made by former SPD of the PDD Nanayakkara when he stated, according to his personal belief, when a director of a Primary Dealer company is a close relative of a CBSL top ranking official, it creates a conflict of interest. He also pointed out it clearly is stated in the Code of Conduct to the Primary Dealers, in the wake of such a conflict of interest, the PDD can withhold or cancel the license of a Primary Dealer. Asked if he knew if Arjun Alosiyus was a close relative to former CBSL Governor Arjun Mahendran, Nanayakkara said he did not, until the occurrences in the recent past.
The Commission then asked Nanayakkara if he knew that former CBSL Governor Ajit Nivad Cabraal’s brother-in-law, niece and two cousins were managerial level officers in DFCC, HNB and Bank of Ceylon, respectively ,when Cabraal was holding office as the CBSL Governor.Nanayakkara denied knowing such information.
Asked if it was a case of conflict of interest, Nanayakkara replied with an affirmative.
The Commission ordered Perpetual Treasuries (Pvt) Limited to handover their balance sheets, annual reports and other relevant document for scrutiny.
Meanwhile the legal representative of the Perpetual Treasuries (Pvt) Limited, pointed out to the Commission it would be better to scrutinize the other Primary Dealers as well, to which the Commission said their mandate does not allow it. However, if there are discrepancies, all may come to light subsequent to the current probing, The Presidential Commission to investigate and Inquire into the Issuance of Treasury Bonds pointed out.
Senior Additional Solicitor General Dappula de Livera, Deputy Solicitor General Milinda Gunatilake and Senior State Counsel Dr. Avanti Perera led the evidence.
