Political storm in the Persian Gulf

A political storm which began with the cutting off of all ties with Qatar by Saudi Arabia, Egypt, the United Arab Emirates and Bahrein and the ultimatum they gave to the former to fulfill 13 conditions is still ranging menacingly.
Qatar has been able to withstand the sanctions and isolation thanks to generous assistance from Turkey and Iran as well as due to its own economic strength. The four countries that cut off ties and closed air and sea traffic to Qatar in an attempt to seek Qatar’s submission have failed and are caught in a dilemma. Though they expected support from the United States later it has quietly retreated after first expressing solidarity with them. It should be recalled here that Saudi Arabia was much emboldened by the open support extended to it by President Trump a few days before the rupture took place. After all the regional operational headquarters of the United States army is in Qatar and it would not risk losing it under any circumstances.
Permutations and combinations of political forces in the region even beyond the Persian Gulf and spreading as far as the Mediterranean are ever changing with world powers too being drawn in willingly or unwillingly. Turkey has already decidedly to strengthen military cooperation with Qatar while its relations with Russia have become warmer and closer. The attempt to have a referendum in Iraq to carve out an independent Kurdistan has brought Iran, the United States and Syria to a common opposition to the move. Meanwhile the United States keeps threatening to revoke the Iran- US Agreement on the nuclear development programme of the latter.

A thaw in the relations between Saudi Arabia and Iran, two regional powers competing for regional dominance in the Arab world is evident by their recent conduct when Iranian pilgrims will visit Macca in pilgrimage after a long time. Both have officially expressed their decision to improve ties.
The Gulf countries would not let Qatar running to Iran for aid as it would weaken their political influence. On the other hand, they too would not like to see Iran nuclear deal cancelled for that would place their countries at peril in case of a future war with nuclear capabilities in the region.
In the meantime Russia has agreed to deliver military equipment to the United Arab Emirates whose principal arms supplier still is the United States.
These relations are still volatile and would take some time to solidify. However, the Persian Gulf and the Mediterranean region would not be the same as before. And there is one more player who would also intervene at least in the sphere of economy. It is China.
EU to probe Monsanto – Bayer deal
German pesticide monopoly Bayer is scheduled to acquire United States seed giant Monsanto in a deal worth US $ 66 billion. Both firms are the largest in the world in their business. The European Union has started an in-depth probe of the deal prior to granting approval. This follows an international petition received by it on behalf of farmers, consumers and environmentalists that the deal will affect them adversely.
A statement issued by the EU last Tuesday said: “The Commission has preliminary concerns that the proposed acquisition could reduce competition in a number of different markets resulting in higher prices, lower growth, less choice and less innovation”. The final decision of the Commission is due by January 8, 2018. In its investigation the Commission is also collaborating with United States, Canadian and South African regulatory bodies too.
One principal market to be affected is the pesticide market. Glyphosate sold under the name “Round Up” by Monsanto faces competition with glyfosinate produced by Bayers under the name “Liberty”. If the merger takes place the Company would become the world’s largest seeds and pesticides business.
Macron’s beauty
Emanuel Macron, the French President who effected drastic budget cuts across the board which caused the head of the French armed forces to resign has used spent 26,000 euros, or nearly $31,000, on makeup in his first three months in office. The magazine Le Pen in a dramatic revelation said that “His makeup artist, a woman named in reports as Natacha M., has billed the executive branch once for 10,000 euros and again for 16,000 euros since Macron’s inauguration”. The president’s office responded to the revelation giving an excuse that said it had “called in a contractor as a matter of urgency,” forcing the president to pay more than usual. Macron will spend a “significantly reduced” sum in the future, the spokesman promised.
Macron’s approval rating had in the meantime deteriorated just as rapidly as it went up at the election time. It now stands at some 30 points.
