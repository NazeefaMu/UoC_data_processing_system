WHERE THE IMMORTAL  MESSIAH WAS COMPOSED

I walked from Brook Street a little distance to reach the end and there in the familiar corner stood the sacred Handel House Museum, dedicated to the soul and spirit of George Frideric Handel, the great baroque composer who scored his famous scores from 1723 to 1959. Messiah, Zadok the Priest and Music of the Royal Fireworks among many other. It is a beautifully restored historic house and gives the feeling that you are among the 18th century filled with music and culture and that Handel is right there, somewhere.
It is alive with music as if it were during his time, played back to back and enhancing the atmosphere are paintings and prints of the composer and of his contemporaries as a backdrop to Handel's life in London. Every visitor makes it a point to listen to the MESSIAH that Handel himself played on his own harpsichord, the instrument that is preciously/ preserved and exhibited in a prominent place and powerfully evocative. Each and all leave the Museum breathless. So, did I though it was my third visit or maybe fourth. Each time I left, MESSIAH left behind its strain lingering in my system.
Spiritual needs
I believe the best classical music is incredibly simple but very poignant and moving; modifying his lyrical contents to suit the spiritual needs of his followers. Many a time I found his music physical, emotional and intellectual. I found his scores as the interplay between conscious and subconscious and I am not his first disciple to say so.
To me his music is an ocean; waves tossing spewing forth in harmony within the walls of the Museum and Handel riding them. One gets the feeling he is all over any time of the day no matter how busy Brook Streets is.
Inspired by an invitation to Dublin to gift one of his works to charity, Handel wrote the MESSIAN, completing it in a feverish twenty-five days to meet the occasion. It was one man's genius and musical achievement, most remarkable with a burst of creativity followed by a succession of oratorios. It showed Handel to be at the height of his powers.
Heavenly score
MESSIAH. Jesus Christ is my Messiah which makes the score extra sacred and spiritual. Scripted first, then to notes next, the heavenly score rose to heights as never known before his time. This sacred cantata (1741) includes his famous passages, 'Every valley shall be exalted', 'I know that my Redeemer liveth' and 'The trumpet shall sound'. There were many other scores that simply became spectacular. From an unpromising beginning flourished the greatest keyboard instrumentalist of the day.
And in this very room where he lived and composed his masterpieces, all of us had the feeling he was at his favourite harpsichord playing the MESSIAH.
Handel Museum is solidly held at 25, Brook Street London where he lived and scrod countless operatic masterpieces was a moving experience, especially MESSIAH and spurring one's imagination the house is perfectly enchanting and beautifully evolved to draw artistic imagination. Adjoining at No. 23, Brook Street, carefully selected manuscripts and printed scores are on display from the Handel House Collection Trust that includes Mozart's arrangement of a Handel fugue considered a tribute to one great Master to another. There is also a letter from Handel to Charles Jennens who was librettist for Messiah and other Handel works. Memoirs of The Life of The Late George Frederic Handel by John Mainwaring (1760) and annotated Jennens is also on display.
Young professionals
There is also Handel's Rehearsal and Performance Room which during opening hours regularly used for rehearsals by the student and young professionals who opt to play their kind of early music before the rush of visitors. Besides, there are popular events such as TALKING MUSIC that involve active audience participation along with FAMILY EVENTS that engage the full family in musical activities. Programmes are also arranged for school workshops as well as for school visits especially beneficial for students sitting for music examinations.
George Frideric Handel was born in 1685 in Halle and died on 14th April 17959 in London. His father was in his mid-sixties when he was born, valet to the Prince of Saxe and in no mood to allow his son to study music.
It not for his understanding mother who introduced him to the Duke and who heard the boy play the organ at a Sunday service, filled his pocket with gold coins and insisted that he was allowed to study music.
He started off as the organist at the Lutheran Church under the care of Fredrick Zachov and sprinted off to a flying musical career. He studied law for a while but knew where the call was. He was a very spiritually moved composer and one can hear the immaculate spirit found in his scores.
He was a very private person and almost obsessively secret but said to have had a violent temper. Many instances were noted where he had threatened his sopranos if they failed and to another instrumentalist that he would jump upon his harpsichord saying he was ahead devil. When he slowed, he became introvert. Once he told one of his critics that he is Beelzebub and knew he had many enemies and to their surprise, he resurrected a genre that was relatively unknown in England-the-Oratorio. These were dramatized Bible stories set to music with massive choruses and with grand orchestral writing.
The genius had arrived and no one could bypass him.
He continued to play the organ and conduct in spite of his deteriorating health and failing eyesight as people flocked to hear him.
When he died his request for a private burial was overlooked as England honoured her famous and beloved son by burying him in Westminster Abbey with over 3000 people attending. A monument erected in his memory shows him at his working table with the score of MESSIAH open at 'I KNOW THAT MY REDEEMER LIVETH' another request he made when he was dying.
