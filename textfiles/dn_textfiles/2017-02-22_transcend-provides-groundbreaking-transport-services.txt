Transcend  provides  groundbreaking  transport services

Since 2009, Sri Lanka has seen strong ‘year-on-year’, double digit-growth in tourist arrivals. Overall infrastructure development has significantly boosted the growth and modernization of tourism, and in particular the level of offerings at hotels.
Contrary to all this, the country’s inbound tourism transport sector, handling over 80 percent of the tourists who visit Sri Lanka, remains lackluster in its approach to provide exceptional transport solutions.
However, unlike most tourist transport service providers who are waiting for government assistance and relief, the evolution of the transport sector is currently being led by a company that is geared to revolutionize travel in Sri Lanka.
Established in the late 1990’s, Transcend Drive, operating under the name Drumkin Transporters has been providing ground-breaking travel solutions, thus far.
Having revitalized passenger transport for Sri Lanka’s national carrier a few years ago, thereby proving that success is a function of creating a niche and earning the customers trust, Transcend Drive is now poised to leverage its expertise and professionalism for the future.
Responsible in recent times for the brand-new fleet of Audis currently being used by Cinnamon Grand and Cinnamon Lakeside, it has emerged as a reputable provider of first class ground transport services within the tourism industry. Offering solutions to business and leisure travellers, the company’s ultimate aim is high quality transport for everyone. Transcend Drive monitors all daily fleet movements via two way and GPS tracking which is fitted to all the vehicles in the fleet. At Transcend, safety is a high priority. Apart from safeguarding passengers with accident insurance policy cover, vehicles are maintained to a high standard, undergoing thorough on-site, daily inspection by a team of fully trained and dedicated technicians, to ensure quality and reliability. Transcends highly experienced chauffeurs are not only well trained and safety conscious, but are also chosen for their driving skills and knowledge of the local terrain. All of them are able to converse well in English whilst there are others who are multilingual having worked for several years in the hospitality industry.
