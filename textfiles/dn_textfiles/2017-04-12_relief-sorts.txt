A relief of sorts

The move by the government to offer a measure of relief to the consumers, for the New Year, by way of a subsidized package of food items is to be commended. According to Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayake, a sack of essential items will be offered to consumers at Rs. 975 although the value will be Rs. 1,515. Doing the Pettah rounds on Sunday in the company of two fellow parliamentarian of the UNP to observe the price situation, ahead of the New Year, Minister Karunanayake said a host of items which are in common use by the ordinary consumer will be contained in the New Year relief package such as rice, sugar B'onions, dhal, potatoes sprats, canned fish, chillies etc. One million sacks will be distributed costing Rs. 540 million, with the price difference to be borne by the Finance Ministry.
It has to be conceded that prices of certain essential items had gone through the roof in recent times despite the best efforts of the government to keep prices under check. Hence the Finance Ministry's efforts to ensure that the consumer will not be fleeced, at least during the festive season (the relief package will be available until April 20), is praiseworthy indeed. One million packages will no doubt reach a wider section of the populace and will cover the areas where the New Year is traditionally celebrated in the far flung villages. There is one snag though. The Minister must ensure that unscrupulous traders don't cash in on the situation, because the temptation will be great for such traders to purchase the sacks in bulk and resell the items at the higher price. Therefore the Ministry should put in place a foolproof method so that the consumers will once again not be fleeced. The best way to ensure this is to limit one sack per family, although the traders could still get a number of families to pool their take and sell the items with a profit. Therefore the Consumer Protection Authority should be ordered to be vigilant lest the government's efforts to provide relief to the masses during the New Year will come a cropper.
It is good that the Minister also included the supermarkets in his itinerary because certain supermarkets sell items above the stipulated prices, naturally, to offset the huge overheads. These supermarkets should be kept in check lest the Minister's much touted price reduction will be brought to naught by such action. Of course, elements in the Joint Opposition, as usual, are mocking at the minister's efforts citing the high prices of coconuts and rice, although certain varieties have come down to normal. They, however do not talk about the low prices of other goods, such as milk power, nor, that of essential drugs, some of which are being sold at ridiculously low prices.
By and large, the government's move to afford some form of relief to the consumer during the festive season should be appreciated although long term solutions have to be found to jeep the prices of essential items in check on the long run.
The President's assurance
President Maithripala Sirisena's assurance that he will not interfere in judicial appointments is to be welcomed. According to an English daily he has assured National Unity Alliance Leader Azath Salley that he would not permit political interference in the appointment of the new President of the Court of Appeal. This, after Salley pointed out that the office of the Chief Justice had been compelled to appoint a Justice, junior in rank, to the Constitutional Council over the heads of two other senior judges. There was also the recent controversy over the appointment of a High Court judge, allegedly due to political interference, by passing a senior judicial officer, which even provoked a confrontation between the BASL, the Association of Judicial Officers’ and the Judicial Services Commission.
Any controversy that involves the judiciary, needless to say, undermines the public confidence in the justice system, making it an object of derision, like how the country's legislature is being viewed today. Hence, all measures should be taken to avoid such controversies. The country's judiciary has undergone vicissitudes under all governments, the most serious instance being when homes of judges were stoned after the ruling a Bench gave was not to the liking of the rulers of the day. For the first time in the country's judicial history a lady Chief Justice, no less, was impeached by a ‘tribunal’ handpicked by the former ruler for that very purpose, and, black flags were hoisted in the hallowed precincts of the country's highest court - a black day indeed for the judiciary. If that was not enough the public were treated to the spectacle of pirith nool being tied on the hand of the impeached CJ within the court premises.
The President should not only ensure there is no political interference in the appointment of judges, he should also see to it that carrots are not dangled before judicial officers in the form of “Adviser” or Ambassador posts, as in the past, that went onto taint the country's judiciary.
