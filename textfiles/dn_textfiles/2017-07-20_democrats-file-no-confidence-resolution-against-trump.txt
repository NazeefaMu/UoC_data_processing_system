Democrats file no confidence resolution against Trump

 
Frustrated Democrat politicians in the US House of Representatives have filed an official “no confidence” resolution against President Donald Trump, formally questioning his suitability to occupy the White House.
The resolution, brought by Rep. Steve Cohen has no chance of successfully passing through the Republican-led chamber, but it provides a comprehensive litany of all of the President’s controversial actions since taking office.
It lists 88 reasons why the Democrats behind the resolution believe Trump is not suitable to hold the Presidency and ranges from citing the furore over crowd sizes at Trump’s inauguration, to the way Trump has handled the investigation into Russian interference in the election.
The list also questions many of Trump’s business deals, his regular volleys against what he calls the “fake news” media, and his derogatory verbal attacks on women.
“It’s just a sad day for Americans that we’ve come to this point,” Cohen said at a news conference on Wednesday.
Trump is “a president that you wouldn’t want your children to look up to,” Cohen said in Washington.
“The way he talks about women, the press, the language he uses, the use of Twitter — you don’t want him to be a role model,” Cohen said. “It’s injurious to our culture, and it’s injurious to … our foreign policy.”
The resolution then makes a list of demands and calls on Trump to release his tax returns, to divest his private business assets, to “refrain from using Twitter inappropriately”, to “unequivocally acknowledge that Russia interfered in the 2016 United States Presidential election”, and to support the First Amendment (freedom of speech) by supporting the freedom of the press and refrain from calling reporting ‘‘fake news’’.

According to a report in The Hill, Cohen conceded his resolution may have little impact on the President.
“Is it going to have an effect on him? Apparently, his family members don’t have an effect on him, his Republican friends don’t, his Cabinet members don’t.”
