CR-Kandy match should be a thriller

The eagerly awaited second round confrontation between defending champions Kandy Sports Club and the formidable CR and FC in the Dialog ‘A’ Division League rugby match at Longden Place today should turn out to be a thriller.
A mammoth crowd is expected at kick-off time 4:00 pm to witness this grand game in the 2016/17 League Rugby tournament.
The match should turn out to be a battle between CR's power-packed forwards and Kandy's speedy three quarters. CR's forwards especially seasoned campaigner Supun Warnakulasooriya, skipper Shane Sammandapperuma, Shawqat Lahir, Shemal Weerasekara, Ishan Noor and Omalka Gunaratne have given a terrific display throughout the season in the loose and should maintain their supremacy.
In the set scrums CR's hooker Warnakulasooriya will have the edge against Kandy's Damith Dissanayake while the line outs should be shared between Kandy's Gayan Ratnayake and Shehan Pathirana and the CR duo of Shemal Weerasekara and Noor.
Kandy's forte has been their speedy three quarters. The halves combination of skipper Roshan Weeraratna and Nigel Ratwatte have to hit it off smoothly as they are playing together their second match for the season. Centres Danushka Ranjan and strongly built Gayan Weeraratne are hard runners who should punch holes in the CR defence with full back Thilina Wijesinghe joining the line to form the overlap.
But the biggest threat to CR will be posed by winger Richard Dharmapala with his power-packed runs down the flank.
The Red shirts have to make the maximum use of the ‘good ball’ that comes their way through their halves combination of brothers Kavindhu and Ashan and they must not delay their passes for their two hard running centres in strongly built Tarinda Ratwatte and Bhanuka Nanayakkara to hit the gaps without being ‘nailed’ by their opposite numbers.
Also they should come up with a much better display as they have two strong runners in winger Sashan Mohamad while on the open side wing they will have the services of diminutive Kavindhu Perera who has impressed with his sizzling runs in addition to an attacking full back Prince Chamara.
Kandy SC beat CR by 50 points to 29 in the first round game at Nittawela after the scores were deadlock at half time 20-all. Another thriller is on the cards today.
