‘Vidyaratne’s irresponsible act lost opportunity to provide solutions’

Uma Oya project issue:
Fisheries and Aquatic Resources Development Minister and Mahaweli Development State Minister Mahinda Amaraweera said he regretted the high handed and irresponsible action taken by Provincial Council Member Samantha Vidyaratne on July 3 by issuing a veiled threat to him when he went on an inspection tour of the Uma Oya project to look into the grievances and problems of affected people in the Bandarawela area.
Amaraweera said this action taken by Vidyaratne prevented a fine opportunity to find solutions to the problems caused by the Uma project to the people in Bandarawela.
Amaraweera toured the villages in the entire affected area accompanied by Deputy Minister Anuradha Jayaratne.
Later Minister Vijayamuni Zoysa also joined them and Minister Patali Champika Ranawaka had intimated his inability to join them due to another urgent official matter.
Amaraweera said while they were looking into the problems of residents in Uda Peruwa where a large number of houses had been damaged, Samantha Vidyaratne arrived on the spot.
After talking in an amicable and friendly manner Vidyaratne took him to a nearby house and threatened to hold him prisoner until a categorical statement was made to halt the project completely.
Amaraweera said he told Vidyaratne that they had come to gather ideas and views of the people to be submitted to the cabinet and thereafter a decision would be taken on the basis of expert views rather than political grounds.
Even through officers of the building research organization repeatedly told him to move out of the house as it would collapse at any moment, Vidyaratne pressed his hands to his (Amaraweera’s) chest and insisted that he would not be allowed to go until a firm decision was announced. At this point, security personnel intervened and allowed him and his team to move out of the house. Amaraweera said he considered Vidyaratne’s behaviour with total contempt as he (Amaraweera) was a peaceful person who did not want to get involved in any controversy.
A fine opportunity to find solutions to the problems of people in Bandarawela was lost due to the irresponsible actions of Vidyaratne. The impression he had about Vidyaratne as an exceptional and clever politician was completely lost and tarnished due to his latest action.
Amaraweera said people in the area represented their problems and issues in a peaceful manner.
The Uma Oya problem required both short term and long term solutions. According to the external and internal situation in the affected area, it was dangerous to keep the people there any longer. As such they should be evacuated urgently.
To resolve this it was decided to acquire a 50 acre plot from a plantation company and re-settle them in it.
As a solution to the drinking water problem it was decided to distribute 3000 water tanks with 500 litre capacity each among the villages and ensure filling of water to them on a continuous basis until a pipe borne water scheme was launched. It was decided to implement a mass scale water supply project to cater to 15,000 families later.
During the discussions he also said that a programme should be implemented to pay compensation towards damaged houses and cultivable land in a fair manner. The government had provided relief to people affected by the Uma Oya project during the last few months. A sum of Rs 197.6 million had already been paid in respect of 1968 damaged houses. Another Rs. 370.4 million had been paid in respect of damaged crops. Almost 440,000 litres of water were being distributed among 2600 families daily utilizing 45 bowsers.
A large number of doctors, professors and intellectuals participated in the inspection tour and the final meeting. But an opportunity to obtain their valuable observations, ideas and views at the final meeting was lost due to the high handed actions of Vidyaratne.
The public was not invited for the meeting scheduled to be held at the Bandarawela Divisional Secretariat, because it was intended to obtain expert views for a final solution. But it was cancelled at the last minute as intelligence sources reported that Vidyaratne was planning to disrupt it with a group of people by hooting and jeering.
As such the meeting was later held at the Irrigation office instead.
