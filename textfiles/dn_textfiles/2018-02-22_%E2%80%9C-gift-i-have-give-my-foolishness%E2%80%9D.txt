“The gift I have to give is my foolishness”

I know him. Do you? If you were young in the 1970s I’m sure you read him once long ago. If you grew up reading the books your parents collected when they were young, you too would know him. If you happen to be a descendant of a generation of bookworms I’m certain that somewhere in your house there is a book he has written. Then again, if neither of these things apply to you, I am sure you would still have read one of his quotes on the wall at the waiting area at the dentist, at the entrance to the public library or in a farewell card you bought for a friend.
He is Richard Bach. The little guy who made Bach a household name with roughly 36,000,000 copies circulating all over the world is Jonathan Livingston Seagull.
Described as tall, unassuming, friendly and approachable by those who have interviewed him, Richard David Bach, a native of Long Beach, Calif.,USA, has always described himself as ‘a creature of the sky.’ He sees flying as “that primal wish in all of us not to be tied by gravity,to be that curious soul above it all.”
Bach says he was a struggling aviation-writer when a “voice” spoke to him, saying the name “Jonathan Livingston Seagull.” Inspired by the voice and two subsequent “cinematic visions” that occurred years apart, he eventually finished a 30-page novella about a seagull who goes off on his own and dedicates his life to flying artfully rather than just pragmatically. The feathery parable of Jonathan Livingston Seagull, soon became one of the top-grossing novels ever written.
Yet, like for most other writers success didn’t come easy. In a world where everyone was expected to fit into the same kind of peg as everyone else, the kind of landscapes Bach created deluded classification. In fact, any kind of boundary seems antithetical to his ideas. As one critic described him, “He was frequently a main character in his fiction. His fiction was not necessarily fiction.” No wonder a lot of publishers rejected him. “I made a game out of collecting rejection slips. When I sent a manuscript out, I needed a rejection slip to expand my collection. Most often I’d get one. Once in a while I’d get a little thing that said, “We want to buy it.” I’d feel almost disappointed.” Bach recalls in a recent interview. Then he adds “Everyone has to come to terms with this somehow, by sheer persistence; you have to find someone to publish your book.”
Here’s how it worked for Bach. One day in 1969, Eleanor Friede, an editor at Macmillan, agreed to look at the much-rejected, novella about Jonathan. She was charmed by his wish to seek freedom. “I think it has a chance of growing into a long-lasting standard book for readers of all ages,” she wrote in a memo to her senior editors.
It was a good hunch. “Jonathan Livingston Seagull,” for which Bach received a $2,000 advance, became one of the biggest successes in publishing history. “After Jonathan, the world said thanks by giving me a lot of money,” Bach says now. “That didn’t mean I was prepared for it.” When seagull mania took over the whole world, Bach not only became suddenly rich but he found he was also single again. He and his wife of 13 years, Bette, with whom he’d had six children, had divorced in 1970. Never well grounded in finance, he invested his windfall—” several million” dollars, with a trusted flying buddy and ended up bankrupt. By 1981 in order to pay $1 million as back taxes he had to relinquish his rights to royalties from his books to the government.
It was during this time that he became reacquainted with Leslie Parrish, a former actress and fledgling producer he had met in 1972 while a film version of Jonathan Livingston Seagull was being made. They both wanted to make a film of of one of his other books, Illusions. That never got off the ground, but a romance did. He married Parrish in 1981.
After they got married, with her help, he managed to rise from the ashes. A year after their marriage, Parrish-Bach, gathered “every penny she had,” Bach says, and bought back his copyrights. Together they wrote two successful books, ‘The Bridge Across Forever’ and ‘One,’ both extolling, he says, “life in an intimate relationship.” Sadly, they divorced in 1997. He married his third wife, Sabryna Nelson-Alexopoulos, in April 1999.
Bach has also tried to make amends for the past in recent years. He admits that he was an absentee father after his divorce but recently he has reconciled with four of his five surviving children. His son Jonathan,named after the protagonist in the best-seller, has also published a book with the chip-off-the-old-block title of ‘Above the Clouds.’
Ask Richard Bach about his writing technique and you will hear the kind of reply only he could give. “I don’t have any special techniques that other writers don’t have; it comes from the idea itself,” he explains. “Irving Stone, for instance, did enormous amounts of research, just boxes and boxes of index cards and he wrote the most beautiful books from that. I am exactly the opposite; I use almost no notes, no research other than my life. My life is my research, and I obviously draw upon my own experience in my stories, but that’s it. I have just a hazy, foggy notion of where this thing might be going. When I was writing “Running from Safety” I had no idea until something like page 342, who one of the characters was. There was this other person hiding behind the character.”
Crazy though this may seem Bach also believes the ironic thing about writing is that it’s an intellectual pursuit but to get there you have to be stupid. The mantra, according to Bach is “to get networked into “Don’t care.” If we think that we must be erudite, intellectual, and must never be seen as foolish, you’ve really started out on the wrong foot as a writer. Most new writers do just that. It takes a lot of experience to learn that the gift I have to give is my foolishness. It’s the craziness of my ideas that make them interesting, make them worthwhile. Once we learn to relax and not to worry about how the reader, the editor, or the publisher thinks of us. Then we can get down to the interesting writing.”
There is no doubt that this theory works. How else would Bach have written Jonathan Livingston Seagull – the iconic phenomenal best-seller that speaks to people who follow their hearts and make their own rules...people who get special pleasure out of doing something well, even if only for themselves...people who know there’s more to this kind of living than meets the eye.
Yes, that’s you. You should be right there with Jonathan, flying higher and faster than you ever dreamed possible.
