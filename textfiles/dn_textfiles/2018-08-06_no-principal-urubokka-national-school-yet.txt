No Principal for Urubokka National School yet

The Urubokka National School in Pasgoda, Matara with over 3000 students has been without a permanent principal since November last year.
Parents said the Education Ministry has failed to assign a permanent Principal since the former Principal was arrested by Urubokke police for alleged assault on a Grade 11 student. He was produced before the Morawaka Magistrate and remanded. Thereafter the former Principal who was released on bail had been temporarily posted to the Southern Education Ministry and subsequently transferred to the Deniyaya Zonal Education office. Parents alleged that the former Principal has another court case against him for alleged unauthorised felling of six trees in the school compound and disposing the timber without notice.
Parents said the lack of a permanent Principal was a serious drawback towards the education of their children. Parents said Education authorities should ensure that a permanent Principal is appointed to the school without delay.
