Promoting solidarity and connectivity among schools

The society aims to promote a sense of unity amongst past pupils of Galle schools living in Colombo and the suburbs, by bringing the community together for friendship, collaboration and networking. Furthermore, the Galle Club intends to build a firm solidarity amongst Past Pupils Associations based in Colombo and Galle while supporting each other for mutual benefit. This Alumni Association which comprises of members representing academics, professionals, politicians and businessmen both young and old, will be steered towards creating a positive impact to member schools.

Thilakumara of Mahinda College, Prof. Janitha Liyanage of Southlands College, Sasima Pinidiya of Sanghamitta Balika Vidyalaya and Hasanka Witharana of Sacred Heart Convent were appointed as the Vice Presidents. Other office bearers elected at this inaugural AGM included Nilmini Ferdinando who was voted in as the Secretary and Janakie Wijethilake as the Treasurer. The following office-bearers were also elected, including Sagara Gunawardena as the Secretary–Elect, Chanura Wijethilake as the Treasurer-Elect and Surani Maharage as the Editor.
Addressing the gathering, the inaugural President Jayaweera stated, “This is a significant moment for all of us who are gathered here today, as six distinguished schools in Galle come together under one proud identity. I am humbled to serve as the President of such a magnanimous association that has the potential to take its member schoolsto greater heights. Together with the newly elected office bearers, I hope to contribute more towards the development of our schools. Thiswill be a momentous beginning that will no doubt pave the way towards building a larger community,consolidating relationships and building bridges.”
