Some recollections of the distant past

To compose this article in the proper format, I will have to repeat only a small paragraph of what I have written earlier.
During my days at Ananda College there were a few great innings played by schoolboy cricketers, some of which I can vividly recollect.
In 1961, under late Yatagama Amaradasa, Ananda won its first three matches beating Royal, Dharmapala and Trinity and in the fourth match against S Thomas’, Ananda gave them a fair lead in the first innings. Ananda then lost five wickets cheaply and seemed to be heading for defeat, till Amaradasa strode in like a colossus all 6 foot 2 inches of him, took charge of the proceedings to score 100 not out. He batted with authority making the strong STC attack look innocuous, he then declared the innings closed setting STC to get 160 odd runs in about 100 minutes. The boys from Mt Lavinia chased this target but were tottering at 48 for 8 when the clock came to their rescue at 6.00 pm.
Amaradasa was in his thirties, when an incident occurred which is worth mentioning. T.D. Rajapakse who was batting with him at the bowler’s end set off for short single to a shot played by Amaradasa who was late in responding. He ambled a few yards down the wicket, then realizing that he had no chance of getting safely to the bowlers end, Amaradasa stopped running knowing that there was a fielder attempting to have a go at the wicket at the bowler’s end, (was it Lareef Idroos?) who was near the stumps. The bowler broke the wicket with one hand and simultaneously tried to catch the ball with his other hand.
(In soft ball parlance this was known as current stumping). He missed the ball and a fielder some distance away from him collected the ball and threw to the bowler, who again tried to catch the ball with one hand while taking one stump out of the ground and he failed to catch the ball again! This was butter fingers at its very best.
According to the rule book, which to my mind sounds absurd, under these circumstances, the fielding side had to put all three stumps together and place the ball on top before they could affect a run out . Rajapakse who was out of danger batting at the other end then took off to the bowlers end while telling Amaradasa to turn around and take a few steps to the safety of the crease at the end where he had originally been.
This peculiar incident is still etched in my memory. Amaradasa survived and they were still batting together when the declaration came. At the same venue, Campbell Place and Ananda/STC again, two years later. STC batting second scored a few more runs than the Anandians in the first innings. They were led by Keith Labrooy.
He was a left-arm inswing cum leg-spin slow bowler, who troubled the Anandians in the first innings. Sarath Wimalaratne, one of the best all rounders produced by Ananda captained the Campbell Place boys. When Ananda batted the second time they lost two wickets to Labrooy, who was threatening to run through the batting line up again. Realising an early threat, Wimalaratne walked into bat determined to hit Labrooy out of the attack.
He accomplished his mission to the brim. It was one of the best innings I have witnessed. Diminutive but barrel chested, Wimalaratne quite often used his twinkling feet to get to the pitch of the ball and hit Labrooy for several sixes over extra covers head and played scorching drives between mid-off and cover. This compelled Labrooy to take himself off the attack. Ultimately, Wimalaratne’s little gem of an innings terminated, which included a run a minute fifty which served its purpose.
STC had to get a mere hundred odd runs to win the match. Wimalaratne then went on to run through the powerful. Thomian batting line up. He ended up with 8 wickets and a match bag of 14 wickets. A newspaper head lined it the following day as ‘Wimalaratne beat STC.”
At present our players are eating humble pie in South Africa, but all is not lost when you consider players like Kusal Mendis, Dhananjaya de Silva who are clocking valuable mileage in the battle field. Lahiru Kumara who can steam roll any batting line up on any given day, should be carefully nurtured. Although the skies are gloomy at present, these stars will rise and shine in the future.
