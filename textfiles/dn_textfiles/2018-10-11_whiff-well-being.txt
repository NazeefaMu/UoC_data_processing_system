Whiff  of well being

If you desire thick, shiny, and beautiful hair then make head massage an integral part of your hair care ritual. Not only is it a wonderfully relaxing holistic therapy, which treats the mind, body and spirit but it will also revive you of any physical or emotional tension. From nourishing your hair deeply to its roots to encouraging the relaxing of your senses a scalp massage is the way to go to achieve your dream of beautiful hair.
 
Scalp massage as a regular part of a hair care ritual
Regular scalp massage strengthens the hair roots leading to hair growth. It is done using oils and if you use a good moisturising oil like jojoba or something in the same calibre, it adds moisture and conditions the scalp, making your hair look more vibrant. Hair that is moisturised regularly is less likely to split or break; thus choose the massage oil wisely.
 
Doing a scalp massage at home
You can give yourself a scalp massage at home. Start by running your hands through your hair while applying oil in a downward pressure movement with your fingers. Move your fingers in small circles as you press down on your scalp. When you’re ready, move your hands in the opposite direction and gradually work down to the sides of your scalp. Finish your massage by gently rubbing around your ears.
 
Dos and don’ts related to scalp massages
There aren’t many things to avoid after a massage but here is a list with what is generally recommended to do after a massage:
* A massage lowers the blood sugar levels. If you are insulin dependent, make sure you keep you blood sugar under control.
* Do not eat right after the massage, unless your blood sugar dropped drastically. Don’t eat a large meal within a couple hours before the massage.
* Do not consume alcohol before a massage.
* Take a shower before a massage therapy.
* Good breathing complements the massage session bringing the patient the most results. It deepens the relaxation and accelerates the purification process. The patient has to learn how to maintain a good breathing.
* Drink plenty of water. The massage sets your lymph in motion, and water helps detoxification.
* If you got an aromatherapy massage, you want the essential oils to stay on your body/head as long as possible. Don’t take a shower right after the massage, if this is possible.
* If possible get a nap. This is the most restful sleep you’ll ever have.
* Plan a bathroom trip immediately after the session.
