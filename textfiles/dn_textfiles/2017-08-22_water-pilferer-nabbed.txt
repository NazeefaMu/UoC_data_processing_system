Water pilferer nabbed

National Water Supply and Drainage Board Special Squad at Ratmalana last week raided a hotel at Dehiwala and found that it was taking water through a pipe attached to a nearby house.
The hotel was receiving a water bill about Rs 50 per month, a board officer said.
The owner has admitted that the hotel was taking water illegally.
He was fined Rs 1.4 million by the Board.
