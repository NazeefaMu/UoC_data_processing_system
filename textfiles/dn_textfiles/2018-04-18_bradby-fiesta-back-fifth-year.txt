Bradby Fiesta back for the fifth year

As April approached and the holiday mood kicked in, the school rugby season has also reached its peak of excitement. Arguably the most anticipated of the events in Colombo is the Bradby Leg that is played between Royal College, Colombo and Trinity College, Kandy. It is not essential to be a part of these two prestigious schools as the oldest rugby encounter in the country is now more of a social gathering than a game of rugby.
In conjunction with the Colombo Leg of the 74th Bradby Shield, the Royal College Union (RCU) has for the last five years organized the “Bradby Fiesta”, a carnival that embodies the fun, camaraderie and exhilarating atmosphere of the game itself. This year the “Brady Fiesta” will be held at the Bloomfield Grounds adjacent to the Royal Sports Complex on April 21 from 9 am to 12 midnight.
“The Bradby Fiesta was originally organized by the RCU to accommodate those who miss the opportunity to witness the live action at the venue - due to seating constraints. Our aim is to allow everyone to experience the game live on giant screens placed at Bloomfield Grounds. The screens will come alive as soon as kick off takes place at 5:30 pm so no one misses even a minute of the excitement. We have also included a lot of new entertainment options for the entire family this year”, said a spokesperson for Bradby Fiesta.
Milo Kids Zone
Milo has been a long-term partner with the Bradby Fiesta and returns this year to power their dedicated Kids Zone packed with fun, games and activities for the young ones. The game that was once enjoyed just by the fathers is today an event of entertainment for the entire family. Starting off from 9 am the Milo Kids Zone will have a wide array of fun games for kids with many attractive and exciting giveaways including mountain bicycles. The Kids Zone will also feature a Breakfast Zone, fun and energy moves, and a fun selfie corner.
Milo together with the Organizers has also paid special attention to create games that stimulate both mind and body of those who will be participating.
Under 10 Tag Rugby Tournament
For the first time this year, Milo and the RCU will also host a Tag Rugby Tournament for the Under 10 age category. Schools and rugby academies including Royal, Trinity, S.Thomas’, S. Peter’s, S. Joseph’s, Wesley, D S Senanayake, Mahanama, Zahira, Thurstan and President’s College, and the Summa Navaratnam Academy and A Goal Academy will take part in the tournament. This tournament will not only be fun and entertainment but will also promote and infuse the need amongst the players of tomorrow to take up the game of rugby seriously.
Sports Medicine Camp
In another first this year, the RCU together with a leading hospital will host a special sports medicine camp.
Professional sports medicine practitioners will provide spot analysis on sports-related injuries, teach on how to avoid and treat on-field injuries and even prescribe physiotherapy sessions for the more serious cases. This medical camp will be open o both young and old alike.
Never-Ending Party
With Sun FM as the Offical Radio Partner, this year’s Bradby Fiesta will have non-stop entertainment from morning till midnight. Celebrate no matter which side wins together with Dj Mira – a Ukranian born female DJ, renowned bands like Black and the Slipping Chairs, and a crazy bunch of DJs aptly calling themselves “DJ Lunatics”. With a magnificent fireworks display, this is one party you do not want to miss.
Hawker’s Street Food
More than 30 vendors spanning 5-star hotels, Colombo’s favourite food chains and street food will provide a true Hawker Street experience throughout the day. Food from all corners of the world will flow in abundance for the entire family to enjoy before, during and after the game.
