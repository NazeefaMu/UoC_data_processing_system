Sri Lanka U18 Sevens Rugby team to participate in Youth Commonwealth Games

The Sri Lankan Under 18 sevens rugby team which won the Asian Sevens series under the captaincy of Thomian Navin Heenakankanamge have qualified to take part in the Youth Commonwealth Games to be held in Bahamas from July 17 to 23 for the first time in the country’s rugby history. The team coached by M.J.M. Mushtaq won the Asian series last year held in Hong Kong and Chinese Taipei and thereby qualified for this tournament.
Sri Lanka has the rare honour of being the only country that will be represented from the Asian region. The only setback for the junior tuskers is that most of the players who played last year’s tournament will not be able to represent them in this tournament due to the eligible age category rule.
Trials to pick the final under 18 squad will most probably be held by end of the month.
