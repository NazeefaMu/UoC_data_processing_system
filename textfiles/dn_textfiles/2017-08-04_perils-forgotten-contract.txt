Perils of forgotten contract

Representative government is a type of social contract in which the elected representatives enter into a contract with the people to carry out agreed reforms to benefit the people. Hence, its existence could be justified only to the extent it honours the contract. Sri Lankan experience, however, is that once elected the representatives of the people forget the contract and begin to act on their own and carry out programmes more on consideration of electoral benefits more than people’s interests.
On matters of economic management they tend to heed more the voice of international financial institutions such as the IMF, World Bank and the WTO more than the voice of the people. For example, the Government that came to power in 1977, which promised to provide 8 Kg of grain to every person, cut the rice subsidy and increased prices across the board, removed most subsidies for the poor. Its programme of divesting state owned enterprises in the private sector was considered as too hasty even by World Bank experts. SLFP led governments since 1995 embraced and perpetuated the executive presidency that they promised to abolish on coming to power.
Some countries have provision in their Constitutions to recall elected MPs and Presidents midway in their term of office. It would be advisable to include such a provision in drafting the new Constitution by the present Constitutional Assembly. Even if not recalled governments have a tendency to subvert or rig the electoral process or use violence as well as large-scale corrupt practices such as bribery and impersonation of voters.
National reconciliation
The performance of the Yahapalana Government seems to be not much different from that of its predecessors as far as honouring the social contract entered on January 8, 2015, despite certain positive outcomes. Exigencies of maintaining power or other interests have compelled it to take momentarily popular or advantageous decisions compromising its own long term benefits. For example it has displayed a tendency to compromise on certain issues affecting its own policy of promoting national reconciliation by taking a defensive position when communal forces began an offensive against it. The hesitation to act promptly when certain interested groups launched a wave of attacks against Muslim establishments and certain Christian religious establishments is an example.
Contrary to the promise to formulate national policies on major issues or aspects of government policies the government has failed to work out a single national policy for the last two and half years. Instead ad hoc reforms are being contemplated implemented piecemeal.
Lack of strategic planning and a holistic approach to development has resulted in certain expensive development projects causing unforeseen damages as happened in the case of the Uma Oya project. Neglecting expert advice in proceeding with the Nilwala Ganga Scheme and halfway-stopping of the same caused untold damage in Matara district during recent floods. Patch-work repairs being implemented even now have the potential of causing still greater damage, as residents point out.
SAITM issue
The adverse effects of the present drought could have been avoided had enough disaster preparedness was in place. The necessity of maintaining adequate buffer stocks of rice for such a contingency could have been foreseen. A more rational and less wasteful use of electricity could have reduced the need for power-cuts.
Nowhere does the impudence and foolishness of the rulers is seen than in the case of SAITM issue. Lack of transparency and political procrastination and intransigence shown in settling the issue has led to a stalemate. The government seems to be oblivious to the fate of nearly 7,000 Medical undergraduates as it refuses to deal with them by any means other than repression.
The effect of their street action on their education and its repercussions on the state healthcare services and professional development of existing cadre is forgotten even by the Minister in charge of health who with the Education Minister and few others seems to teach the students a lesson by confining them to the streets.
The fact that the former President and his opportunist band of the JO is supporting the agitation by the GMOA and Medical students need not make them blind to the issues raised by them. It would be foolish to conclude that the entire student body or the fraternity of doctors is inspired by the former President. In doing so they are pushing a large mass of voters into the lap of the former President or other opponents of the regime. Any government with a modicum of intelligence would try by civilized means to win them and keep the majority of them as its supporters.
Striking petroleum workers
As stated in this column earlier Government keep on repeating that there is too much democracy. Recent talks about devising means of preventing street protests on the pretext of inconveniencing the public could then be an attempt to curb democratic space opened up in January 8. Taken in conjunction with the sadistic attack on striking petroleum workers it is apparent that the Yahapalana government has taken a leaf from the handbook of the former autocratic regime.
The manner in which government spokesmen try to re-define the role of trade unions and other civic organisations confining them to economic issues only shows that they are not even willing to recognize their rights to freedom of expression and association recognized by bourgeois liberal democracy while claiming to profess social democracy.
It is also regrettable that the government has taken a hundred and eighty turn with respect to fighting bribery and corruption. The exposures at the Presidential Commission of Inquiry on the Central Bank Bond issue points to distinct attempts by leading figures in the present government to cover up the scam.
While these politicians enjoy the privileges of government and the security provided by state law enforcement agencies they could only ignore at their own peril the fact their Judgement Day would inevitably come in 2020, if not earlier.
