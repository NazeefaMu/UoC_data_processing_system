Recent postal strikes:
Cabinet paper to provide suspended salaries submitted

A Cabinet paper proposing to provide postal workers whose week’s worth of salaries were suspended due to the recent strikes, had been submitted for approval, Posts, Postal Services and Muslim Religious Affairs Minister Abdul Haleem said.
The minister was addressing a ceremony held yesterday at the Postal Headquarters to hand over appointment letters to the regional drivers of the department.
“The postal strike lasted for two weeks prior to its conclusion on June 26. However, by June 19 we issued a notice urging workers to report to duty, adding that if they failed to comply, the department would consider them to have relinquished their posts. Hence, the issue is the workers not getting their salaries on those seven days,” the minister said.
“However, if Cabinet approval is received, we would be able to provide them their lost salaries,” he added.
Meanwhile, the Postal Trade Union Alliance said they would commence another postal strike if the Postal Department failed to provide the salaries. Alliance Convener Chintaka Bandara said 26,000 workers were facing difficulties due to the issue and therefore, a strike would be called if the demands were not met by today. He added that all the post halted during the previous strike had been distributed.
Minister Haleem said the Postal Department had faced a total loss of Rs. 150 million due to the strike.
