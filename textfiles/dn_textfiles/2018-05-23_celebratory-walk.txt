Celebratory walk

The Sri Lanka Embassy in the Republic of Korea supported and participated in the Sri Lanka Parade in the annual Lotus Lantern Festival 2018 in Seoul in celebration of the Vesak. The annual Lotus Lantern Festival held in central Seoul is a majestic parade involving the participation of Korean Buddhist monks and devotees, carrying the beautifully lit and decorated lanterns of all shapes and sizes. It is organised by the Yeondeunghoe Preservation Committee of Korea.
The Sri Lanka parade this year was organised by the Maha Bodhi MahaViharaya in Korea under the patronage of Venerable Welahinne Vachissara Thero, with the support of the Sri Lanka Embassy, the Mahamewnawa Meditation Monastery, the Korea-Sri Lanka Maha Viharaya and the Sri Lankan community in Korea.
The Sri Lankan parade included a large lantern replicating the Ruwanveli Seya, as well as Vesak Lanterns, prepared according to the Sri Lankan Buddhist tradition, and Buddhist flags. Around 100 Sri Lankans participated in the parade despite the rains, making it the largest Sri Lankan parade at the Lotus Lantern Festival in recent times.
The Embassy support for the event was led by the Employment and Welfare section under the leadership of Counsellor / Employment and Welfare Jagath Batugedara in coordination with Sri Lankan Buddhist Temples and the Sri Lankan community based in and around Seoul.
Sri Lankan Ambassador Manisha Gunasekera attended the Festival as a special invitee.
The Lotus Lantern Festival has a long tradition of more than 1,200 years and is designated as National Intangible Cultural Property by the Korean government.
It attracts a large number of visitors among Korean festivals including diplomats, expatriates and tourists.
