Altair supports ‘Semata Sevana’ programme

At least 16 needy rural families will receive houses through a donation made by luxury condominium builder Indocean Developers to the ‘Semata Sevana’ (Shelter for All) programme of the Ministry of Housing and Construction.
The promoter of Altair, the twin-tower high rise in Colombo 2, recently presented a cheque for Rs 5 million to the Sevana Fund in support of an initiative to construct six flagship villages for the ‘Uda Gammana’ project of the Semata Sevana programme.
“A request for assistance to this worthy cause was received by the Condominium Developers Association,” Indocean Developers Director Pradeep Moraes said. “As a civic conscious corporate entity, we were happy to make a contribution to this effort.”
Altair’s contribution was presented to Housing and Construction Minister Sajith Premadasa by Moraes and fellow director K. Sathian at a ceremony at the Ministry.
