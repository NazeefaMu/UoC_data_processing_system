Royal go out favourites against St. Peter's

High riding Royal College Colombo will go out with a clear edge against unpredictable St.Peters College Bambalapitiya in their Singer ‘A’ Division inter school league rugby tournament second round final match for the B.C. Anghie trophy to be played at Royal College Sports Complex today at 4:00pm.   
The Royal lads under the leadership of winger Sabith Feroz have an unblemished record in this year’s ongoing league rugby tournament where they are yet to lose a game this season being the only team in the league to be unbeaten.   
Royal cause has been severely bolstered by the presence of their ever reliable forwards who have given a sensational display this season together with their whole ‘eight’ dominating the set pieces and having abundance of ball position through line outs, rucks and mauls. Spear headed   
by crack flanker cum vice-captain Maleesha Madumevan , prop forwards Sasitha Siyath, Samadi Induwara, number eight Himantha Hirushan and second row forward Fadil Adahan. Along with their speedy three quarter line scoring tries through their famous three quarter moves. Also they have a reliable place kicker in full back Dulan Gunawardena and his contribution in this match with his kicking boot will be  vital for a Royalist victory.   
On the other hand St.Peters College possesses a good team with play maker Jason Karunaratne along with their entire three quarter line can play an outstanding game to bring victory to their school but has been blowing hot and cold and is feeling the unexpected loss they had against their arch rivals St.Josephs College last week.   
Meanwhile this will be a do or die battle for St.Peters College and if they lose this battle to Royal College today in this match, then it could be worse for them as they might slip further down in the rankings.   
Kingswood – Wesley    
   
The confrontation between  Kingswood College Kandy and Wesley College Colombo in the Singer ‘A’ Division inter-Schools league rugby second round match for the L.E. Blaze Trophy at Race Course grounds in Colombo , should turn out to be a close affair today. The match is due to kick off at 4.00 pm.   
Kingswood who won against Zahira College last week under the Consultant coaching of  dedicated and hardworking former Sri Lanka national head coach Ronny Ibrahim will have a slight edge today.   
The forte of the Kingswood College team has been their speedy three quarter line hence today they will give a torrid time to the Wesley outfit.   
Wesley lost badly to Trinity outfit last week, hence they will have to be at their very best if they are to at least make a match of it against the formidable Kingswood team, as to date the Kingswood lads looks a much better team comparatively to Wesley boys.   
Going by the two team's starting line ups and the performance so far in this ongoing league tournament, this will be a very close game and the team who played better in the first half will have a clear chance to pull pff this game
