Altair adjudged Best Condo in Asia for Architectural Design

Sri Lanka’s contemporary architectural masterpiece Altair has beaten condominium developments in 15 countries in Asia including Singapore, Hong Kong, Japan, China and Australia, to win the ‘Best Condo Architectural Design’ Award at the 2018 Asia Real Estate Summit (ARES) hosted by PropertyGuru Asia in Bangkok, Thailand.
The only Sri Lankan high-rise ever to be adjudged the best in Asia, Altair was honoured at PropertyGuru’s ‘Best of the Best’ awards, at which individual winners selected at country award events throughout the year, were contenders.
Markets from Sri Lanka to China competed at the largest Grand Final event to date of the 13 year old Asia Property Awards, attended by more than 500 guests, with developers from Japan and Australia making their debut at the ceremony. The countries that competed for awards were Singapore, Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia, Vietnam, Sri Lanka, China, Hong Kong, Macau, Mongolia, Australia, Japan, Philippines, Myanmar and Cambodia.
Altair’s award was accepted on behalf of promoter Indocean Developers by two of the company’s directors, Jaideep Halwasiya and Pradeep Moraes.
“We are justifiably elated at winning this award, which is a tribute to the architectural genius of Moshe Safdie and the vision and courage of the promoters of the project, who had confidence, not only in their ability to build Altair, but also in the market’s potential to do justice to such a remarkable edifice,” Moraes said. “The word icon is sadly overused today, but by winning this award we have emphatically shown why Altair richly deserves that adjective.”
Among the condominium developments that competed for the ‘Best Condo Architectural Design’ in Asia award were ‘8 St Thomas’ by Bukit Sembawang Estates Limited, Singapore; ‘Alpha City’ by Alpha King, Vietnam; ‘Glorious Mansion’ by Long For Group Holdings Limited, China; ‘Mount Pavilia’ by New World Development Company Limited, Hong Kong; ‘Scenia.Bay’ by Nam Tien Lao Cai Jsc. Co., Vietnam; ‘Sunplay The Heights Bangsaray’ by Sunplay Asia Limited, Thailand; ‘Stirling Residences’ by LN Development (Stirling) Pte Ltd., Singapore; ‘Taman Anggrek Residences’ by Agung Sedayu Group, Indonesia; ‘The CUVÉE’ by Chaopraya Mahanakorn Public Company Limited, Thailand; ‘The Smith’ by Triniti Land, Indonesia and ‘The Vales’ by Anchorvale Residences Pte Ltd., Singapore.
Speaking at the awards event, Terry Blackburn, Managing Director, Asia Property Awards and Property Report of PropertyGuru said, “Today, Asia has the fastest growing economies and most exciting real estate markets in the world, and the majority of award winners are Asian developers selling to Asian buyers and are helping millions achieve the dream of home ownership.”
He also expressed the hope that the years the Asia Property Awards have spent promoting Sustainable Development, Green Buildings and Corporate Social Responsibility, have in some small way, contributed to the conversation on what the best Asia should look like in the future.
