FM orders to expedite investigation on seized timber

A large stock of timber was seized by Customs in 2014 while it was smuggled through Sri Lanka.
The illegal timber stock had been seized by the Customs during the previous regime, and no action has been taken with regard to the seizure for the past three years, denying the government its due penalty or proceeds from auctioning. Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayake pointed out that the Customs Department should be held responsible for the liability.
The minister pointed out that by delaying the inquiry into the seized timber stock, certain officials of the Customs Department are trying to embarrass the government.
He pointed out that certain officers of the Customs Department are attempting to fuel the propaganda machines of the Joint Opposition led by a few politicians who are responsible for the ruin of this country. He said the negligence of Customs officers to deny investigation of the stock of smuggled timber for the past three years is evidence of their malicious intentions.
Karunanayake ordered the Director General of the Customs Department Chulananda de Silva on Monday to probe the incident extensively and submit a report.
The government led by the President and Prime Minister are taking measures to end corruption and other misappropriation in the country and if the Customs Department which comes under the purview of the Finance Ministry has disregarded legal procedures in connection with this incident, stern action will be taken against those responsible, he said.
