Moral development workshops for LG representatives

A series of moral development workshops will be held for the benefit of Provincial Council representatives at provincial level shortly to establish a conducive Local Government (LG) institutional structure in the country.
President Maithripala Sirisena disclosed this plan when he attended a workshop attended by newly elected Local Government representatives held at Polonnaruwa as the Chief Guest on June 1.
The President said all this time Local Government institutions operated only for the purpose of physical resources development.
“But, in future these institutions should become a focal point contributing towards the creation of a good, disciplined society by ensuring the moral and spiritual development of the people,” the President said.
The President who stressed the importance of implementing programmes at Local Government institutions level with a proper understanding of the responsibility of building a disciplined society and law abiding citizens in the area represented by a Local Government institution added that it should also focus on combating drugs and finding solutions to various social challenges by identifying them.
Addressing Local Government representatives in the Polonnaruwa district in particular, the President noted that the most important thing in the council operation was their behaviour. It was then that they could obtain the support of government officials for the development programme of their area and transform the Local Government institution into a place acceptable by the people.
Pointing out the need for a sense of discipline, good character, patience hearing and building creativeness, the President explained that the new Local Government representatives were duty bound to move with the people, to find out their needs and problems and attend to them at institutional level.
Parliamentarian Nalaka Colonne and Polonnaruwa GA Ranjith Ariyaratne were among those present on the occasion. The President also handed over three wheelers to some beneficiaries under the Pibidemu Polonnaruwa Development programme.
