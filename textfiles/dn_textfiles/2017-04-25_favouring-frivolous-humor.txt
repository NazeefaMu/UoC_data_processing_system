Favouring frivolous humor

Imagine Alec Baldwin in a baby’s body, wearing a suit and carrying a briefcase! If you’ve loved Baldwin in 30 Rock, The Boss Baby might be your cup of tea.
Directors Hendel Butoy and Tom McGrath test your threshold for quirky stories. At the Templeton home, seven-year-old Tim is struggling to garner the attention of his parents after the arrival of a baby who is always, inexplicably, wearing a suit.
The ‘baby’ turns out to be a corporate at Baby Corp, where human offspring are produced. After coming to an agreement that the baby will exist after completing his mission on earth the two brothers get together to fight Puppy Co., which produces babies’ biggest competition: puppies.
Endless chases
The story itself turns into quite a cliché with an evil villain and a little boy and his side kick trying to save the day. This is a movie which is typically made with the younger audience in mind though it will bring out a few laughs out of grown ups too.
However the endless chases between the kids and the evil workers at Puppy Co tired the viewers.
There is too much monotony in this game that you cannot help glancing at the clock and wish for the film to end.
Despite targeting kids through its plot and execution, the one-liners in the film are clearly meant for adults. For example at one time when Tim tells the baby where babies come from it is clear that he makes a suggestion which is suitable for adults.
Some of the behavioural traits of the babies too suggest that the movie is made to rope in the adult audience as well.
Bland angle
The film clearly has so much potential which the story angle it starts off in. The concept too may have sounded like a winner given that two of the most lovable huggable beings, babies and puppies, are pitted against each other. It also has lots of space for humour.
However all of this gets washed away with the bland angle it takes. The Boss Baby is so caught up in being silly that it remains blithely unaware of its detachment from a child’s psyche and the possibility of being perceptive.
Loosely based on a picture book of the same name, written and illustrated by Marla Frazee, the film is visually enjoyable.
There’s a lot of physical comedy too, some of which is funny. But the film seldom makes use of its strengths or its three dimensional effects.
