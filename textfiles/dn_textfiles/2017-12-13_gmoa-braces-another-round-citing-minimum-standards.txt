GMOA braces for another round  citing minimum standards

The Government Medical Officers' Association (GMOA) said will take the toughest trade union action possible if the Health Minister gazettes 'distorted minimum standards' for medical education which is three simple passes (S).
"No Sri Lankan student can enter university (even for the Arts stream) with three simple passes", GMOA Assistant Secretary Dr. Navin De Zoysa said.
He said that the minimum standards of medical education was decided during a discussion held in presence of the Prime Minister's Secretary, scholars and the GMOA and said it should be gazetted.
But it was reported that the Health Minister has presented a cabinet paper with distorted minimum standards for medical education with the support of the University Grants Commission Chairman. The minimum standards for medical education should be decided based on every previous year's minimum qualification for university admission (medical faculty).
GMOA Assistant Secretary Dr. Nalinda Herath said that there are two sections in the original minimum standards for medical education and the first part which is schedule - 1 contains the minimum standard methodology. Schedule 2, which is the second part, contains the system of implementing law, especially when the minimum standards for medical education are violated. The Health Minister has presented the cabinet paper with only Schedule - 1 (first part).
"The Health Minister stopped gazetting the minimum standards for medical education in 2006, as a member in the Opposition and he did the same as a Cabinet Minister in 2010.Now he does it as the Health Minister. Students will agitate again if the distorted minimum standards for medical education are gazetted," Herath said
