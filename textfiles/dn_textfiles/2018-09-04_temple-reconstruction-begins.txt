Temple reconstruction begins

The reconstruction of the Kankesanthurai Thaiyiddi Tissa Viharaya, which was destroyed during the civil war, began with the participation of Northern Province Governor Reginald Cooray, last week.
The event was held under the patronage of Ven. Padagoda Vimalagnana Thera.
A sanghawasa (monastery) and a dharmashala (a pilgrims' rest house) would be constructed at the temple, with funds from the Buddhist Affairs Ministry. The Governor said the deed of the temple had been written in 1946, while the last Vesak festival celebrated there was on May 17, 1954.
