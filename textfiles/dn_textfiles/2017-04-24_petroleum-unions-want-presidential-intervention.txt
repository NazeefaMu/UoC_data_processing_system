Petroleum unions want Presidential intervention

 
The discussions between the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation (CPC) trade unions and Petroleum Resources Minister Chandima Weerakkody were called off today with trade unions demanding the intervention of President Maithripala Sirisena.
The Ceylon Petroleum Corporation (CPC) trade unions launched an island-wide strike from midnight Sunday (24) against a decision by the government to go into an agreement with India regarding the management of oil tanks in Trincomalee.
