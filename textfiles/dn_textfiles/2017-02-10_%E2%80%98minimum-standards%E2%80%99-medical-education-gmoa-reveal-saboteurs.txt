‘Minimum Standards’ for medical education: GMOA to reveal saboteurs

The Sri Lanka Medical Council (SLMC) presented the recommendations on `Minimum Standards’ for medical education through a gazette notification in 2009, but it ended up in a Parliamentary Committee without getting through. It was later withdrawn. The Government Medical Officers’ Association (GMOA) will reveal who opposed it, GMOA Secretary Dr. Navin De Zoysa said.
Addressing the media at the GMOA Head Quarters in Colombo 7 on Wednesday, he said it was time for President Maithripala Sirisena to put his stand on the SAITM into action just as he did for the National Drug Policy which was not possible during the previous regime while holding the Health Minister portfolio.
According to Dr. Zoysa, the Bangladesh Medical Council closed the Chittagong Medical Faculty as it did not have proper standards.
No Sri Lankan Minister or parent shouted at the Bangladesh Government stating that Sri Lankan medical students studying in the faculty are in trouble. The SLMC continues to check the standards and close down medical faculties which do not meet the standards, he said.
The GMOA Secretary said while ensuring the right to education, nobody can eliminate the right to life of the people.
Driving licences are being issued to allow persons to drive while ensuring the safety of pedestrians, he said.
The GMOA respects the right to life of the people and that is why it continues to function accident services and emergency medical services during strikes, he said.
