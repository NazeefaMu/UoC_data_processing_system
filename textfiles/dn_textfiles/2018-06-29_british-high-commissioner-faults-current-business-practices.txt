British High Commissioner faults current business practices

British High Commissioner James Dauris addressed the Sri Lanka Institute of Directors at their Annual Meeting this Tuesday, emphasizing the importance of healthy competition and the need to eliminate corruption as keys to economic growth and development.
Dauris offered words of advice and his observations on the country’s economic growth, after spending three years as the British High Commissioner to Sri Lanka and Ambassador to Maldives. Dauris fit his counsel into the six-letter acronym “ACCESS”: Account, Corporate Governance, Competition, English, Standards, and Support.
‘Account’ was the first point of Dauris’ speech: “Holding the government to be accountable and representing the interests of the business community are critical functions of business leaders in any country.”
The High Commissioner continued by raising the issue of accountability within corporations themselves: “Whatever the field, it requires a lot more determination and firmer principles to stay straight and play by honest rules when people around you aren’t doing the same and when corruption is a serious problem.”
He also encouraged the Sri Lanka Institute of Directors to help themselves by using global standard benchmarks in order to successfully integrate Sri Lankan business into the global marketplace.
The High Commissioner did save some praise for his own colleagues at the British Council and in the British government, for their work to improve the standards of English in the country. He remarked that 173 schools from around the country had participated in the British Council International School Awards Ceremony, a promising indicator of greater English fluency in the coming years; Dauris asserted that an English medium will be the key to financial success in the future as well.
Finally, the British High Commissioner asked the room to support the government towards the goal of “restoring investor confidence in Sri Lanka’s private and public sectors.” Dauris quoted from the Institute of Directors’ website. He said, “Moving Sri Lanka up the World Bank’s Ease of Doing Business Index, for example, needs to involve partnership. It needs business and government encouraging, helping and supporting each other. It needs them to be open with and critical of each other. I don’t always get the feeling that the business community is doing as much as it can and needs to be doing to help. My sense is that there are appropriate opportunities for you to speak up as a group more often than you do. I’d encourage you, for instance, to use your public authority and your influence with the government to help press down on permit mentalities, to simplify the setting up of businesses, to liberalise labour laws that hold development back. The voice of business and your collective voice as business leaders matter.”
