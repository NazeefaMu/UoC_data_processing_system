Road opened by two ministers still incomplete

Two ministers have inaugurated on two separate occasions a half-completed road in Habaraduwa, Galle, in 2016, but its restoration work is yet to be completed, the people of the area said.
The Kabaragala-Pusswelkada 10th Mile Post Road in the Imaduwa Divisional Secretariat Area in Habaraduwa, Galle has been opened twice in this way.
The road renovated under the Integrated Road Development Project funded by the Asian Development Bank was first opened on August 27, 2016 with the participation of a group of former Local Government representatives. The same road was inaugurated again on October 19, 2016 by another minister.
Although the two politicians opened the road, its renovation work was yet to be completed, the people in the area said.
