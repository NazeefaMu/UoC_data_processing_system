Post elections riots destroying public property in Hambantota

A corrupt political force which was rejected by the people during the Presidential Election and General Election in 2015 is currently engaging in a riot by destroying public property and this is an awful sign of country’s destruction, Housing and Construction Minister Sajith Premadasa charged.
Issuing a special statement yesterday, Minister Premadasa said that both victory and the defeat of a political party is decided by the people and the inability to celebrate the victory in a peaceful manner shows the indiscipline of the people.
He said, voters have the right to cast their vote for the preferred political parties. So the defeat of a political party is not an offence to face punishments or harassments to the supporters of that party.
Commenting on some incidents of destroying public property in Hambantota by a group of people, Minister charged that all these things have been done to fulfill the desire of a group of people who failed to do anything for the betterment of the public when they remained in power.
Further commenting on that, Minister Premadasa said that he was able to implement a large number of development activities and community services during past three years.The Minister said that the property of a resident of Punchiappujandura in Lunugamwehera who is engaged in self employment had been allegedly destroyed by a group of people and he questioned who is responsible for this crime?
