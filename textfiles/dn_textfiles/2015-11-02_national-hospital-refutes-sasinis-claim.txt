National Hospital refutes Sasini's claim

Officials of the National Hospital of Sri Lanka (NHSL) yesterday rejected complaints by Sasini Sandeepani and the Inter University Students' Federation (IUSF) that Sandeepani was discharged by doctors of the National Hospital despite having head pains.
The IUSF and Sandeepani made the complaint while addressing the media on Sunday. She said a doctor asked her to admit herself to the hospital when she channeled him after being discharged from the hospital and he asked her to do a CT Scan as well.
NHSL sources said that they will never discharge a patient without treating the person.
All students, monks and policemen admitted to the hospital following the clashes between the students and the police have already been discharged as they were not in a critical condition," the sources said.
Meanwhile, Sasini Sandeepani said she or her family have no way of using a hand phone or a land phone as several telephone calls claiming they were from the Cinnamon Gardens Police ask her to report to the police to give statements from time to time.
IUSF Convener Lahiru Weerasekara challenged the police for a debate on the October 24 incident.
He said they have sufficient evidence to prove the truth which senior police officers are trying to hide.
