‘Journalism not recognised profession yet’

Journalism has not received recognition as a profession, Sri Lanka Press Complaints Commission Officer Kamal Liyanarachchi said.
He was speaking at a seminar at Bindunuwewa, Bandarawela to raise awareness of provincial journalists in the Badulla district on the Right to Information Act.
He said criteria to elevate the practice of journalism to a professional level are yet to be achieved. He said the Press Complaints Commission acts as a self-regulating body in Sri Lanka.
“Journalism is a profession that has not received legal recognition. The Working Journalists’ Association has not been included in the list of Professionals’ Associations. We need to have a Code of Ethics, special training, regulation mechanism, and a system of promotion, recruitment and salary scales for those engaged in journalism. These are challenging things. The Sri Lanka Press Institute works to overcome them,” he said.
