UNP, only representative of the working class: Range Bandara

Skills Development and Vocational Training State Minister Palitha Range Bandara said yesterday that after assuming power, the UNP is the only political party that fulfilled promises made to the working class during the election campaign.
"The UNP said they would increase the salaries of the public servants and we did it within one year of assuming office. We also raised the salaries of private workers and the entire working class. In accordance with our promises to increase the efficiency of public servants, we directed them to various foreign and local training programmes while introducing the latest technology to them. We also activated all non-functioning anti corruption bodies to tackle malpractices and corruption. Now the working class has acknowledged that the UNP is the real representative of the working class," he said.
Addressing a media briefing held in Sirikotha yesterday, he said the government has also engaged in uplifting not only the working class, but the entire population. "Thousands of new houses are being built for the ordinary people. The monthly medical bill of most medicine users has reduced by about 40 percent due to the reduction in drug prices. The country has also received due recognition from the international community. But, certain politicians who have lost the people's trust are now making various allegations and engaged in various demonstrations against the government. But, those are the people who shot and killed protesters in Rathupaswala. He said that all arrangements have been made to hold the UNP’s May Day rally at Campbell grounds on grand scale on May 1. We expect at least 200,000 people to participate in the rally. We urge everyone that if they support fraudsters and corrupt politicians to go to the JO May Day rally at Galle Face Green and all those who oppose them to come to our May Day rally at Campbell grounds. We have spent only party funds on May Day cut-outs," he added.
Wayamba Provincial Council Opposition Leader Prasanna Shamal Senarath said that the oil tanks in Trincomalee has been lying idol for the past 90 years. "Just as when we are making plans to make better use of it several self-serving politicians with sinister motives are trying to cripple it. It was in 2003, that the agreement was entered into with IOC to utilize the oil tanks in a more efficiency way. Accordingly, IOC is using 15 oil tanks and other 85 tanks are empty. It is a criminal folly to let these resources go to waste."
He further said the new contingency unit under the Regional Development Minister Sarath Fonseka will help the government to face crisis situations in crucial sectors such as power and energy.
"Everyone has a right to engage in demonstrations, but, they cannot interrupt or intimidate the activities of the ordinary people," he said.
