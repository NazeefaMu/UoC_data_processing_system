Cabinet approves training institute development for Buddhist nuns

Kurunegala District UNP Parliamentarian and Buddhasasana, Wildlife and Sustainable Development Minister Gamini Jayawickrama Perera told the Daily News today in Kurunegala that Cabinet approval has been received to develop training institutes for Buddhist nuns countrywide. It is also planned to introduce new, meaningful and well-planned training courses for the nuns in order to improve their spiritual and religious understanding, through the government patronage.
About 4,000 nuns are to benefit from this project.
The maintenance of nuns’ training firms would be done with government funds. Consequently, an advisory board would be appointed soon to regularize the activities of these training institutes.
A sum of Rs. 230 million would be spent this year for the development of nuns’ welfare and academic activities, said Minister Gamini Jayawickrama Perera.
