Govt. urged to create more jobs

Production based economy will keep women here:
An organisation called “Free Woman” urged the government to create more jobs within the country by initiating a production based economy to minimise the number of women going abroad for foreign jobs.
The convener said women going for foreign jobs are subjected to numerous issues, including losing the lives.
The solution to minimise the number going abroad for employment is to create more employment opportunities within the country.
“The government is duty bound to generate more employment opportunities by implementing a production based economy. The government has failed in implementing a production based economy” she said.
She said the intervention of the government institutions, including the Foreign Employment Bureau, Diplomatic Missions abroad, are not sufficient in connection with the issues faced by the women employed abroad.
She said foreign jobs means slavery.
Women employed abroad are subjected to sexual harassment, while others are tortured.
She said many women tend to go for foreign employment due to the shortage of jobs in the country.
