‘Floral Magic’ to enchant flower enthusiasts

Shi-en Ikebana and Floral Art Society celebrates 25 glorious years of friendship and harmony through flowers by holding a exhibition of flowers. Titled ‘Floral Magic’ the public can expect fascinating floral displays by members using fresh or dried flowers, foliage, wood, and even untraditional materials like plastics, pipes, iron etc. There will be about 40 exhibits which will be categorized under Western style and Ikebana style.
‘Floral Magic’ will be held at Winchester Hall, The Kingsbury Hotel, on May 20 from 9.30 am to 7 pm.
There will be a demonstration by Harijanto Setiawan at 4 pm on the same day.
When we think about arranging flowers - placing flowers in a vase comes to mind and sometimes we can get intimidated quickly. Arranging and designing flowers should be fun. Many of the members of the Shi-en Ikebana and Floral Art Society (SIFAS) are ladies who loved flowers and joined SIFAS to interact with others who enjoyed flowers too. ‘Floral Magic’ is one of their efforts. The standards of the exhibitions have improved since the society held their first exhibition 25 years ago.
The Society brings down experts in western floral arranging and also Ikebana, the Japanese art of floral arrangement, to help members improve their skills in this delightful and pleasurable activity.
‘Floral Magic’ is an exhibition for all ages. A lot of people think flower arrangements are confined to older women with time on their hands but this is a misconception. Busy young executives can relax and unwind by taking time to beautify their homes by doing a floral arrangement. Enjoying nature is an ideal way of de-stressing after a hard day’s work.
The club’s adviser Harijanto Setiawan, is an acclaimed floral designer who had won numerous international awards. He is also a trained architect. Harijanto’s experience and expertise in structural and floral designs implies that he is capable of transforming ideas into ambitious reality. He will be here to assist the members to design high standard exhibits.
The Shi-en Ikebana and Floral Art Society held their 25th anniversary last year, with an extravagant Floral Fashion Show titled ‘Silver Dazzle’ produced by Harijanto. Equipment and drugs were purchased for the Thalassaemia Unit of the Kurunegala General Hospital from the proceeds of this event. Proceeds from this exhibition too will be used to help children suffering from Thalassaemia. A visit to the floral exhibition will not only be a “feast for the eyes” but will also help towards purchasing equipment and drugs for children with Thalassaemia.
