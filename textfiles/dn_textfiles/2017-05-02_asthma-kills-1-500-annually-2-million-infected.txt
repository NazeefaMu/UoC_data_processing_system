Two million people in Sri Lanka suffer from Asthma and annually 1500 of them die from the same.
But this situation is completely preventable, Consultant Chest Physician attached to Kandy Teaching Hospital Dr. D. Medagedara said.
Addressing a press conference at the Government Information Department Auditorium in Colombo yesterday he said that asthma is increasing among children and especially among pre-school kids and kids from urban areas in the country.
Many Asthma patients take the drug Salbutamol and this can lead to various complications including death, he said.
Salbutamol should be taken only on doctor's instructions when asthma gets worst.
No asthma patient should take this drug on his/her own without medical advice, the consultant chest physician said.
Free consultation and drugs available in state hospitals for asthma. People should always breathe fresh and clean air. They should always avoid inhaling fumes of mosquito coils, cigarettes, perfumes, joss - sticks etc., he said.
