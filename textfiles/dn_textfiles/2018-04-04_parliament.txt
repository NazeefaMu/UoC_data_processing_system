No-Confidence motion on Prime Minister: Vote to be taken up in Parliament at 9 pm today
The Vote of No-Confidence on Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe, is to be taken up at 9 pm in Parliament today, following a full-day debate.
The No-Confidence Motion was submitted to the Speaker by the Joint Opposition on March 21, carrying the signatures of 55 MPs including four SLFP members from Government ranks.
Parliament will meet at 9.30 am today and the debate on the NCM would commence at 10 am after the oral question round. The debate is expected to continue till 9 pm, while the vote would be taken up by name or by row. A series of eleventh-hour meetings took place at Parliament and outside it yesterday, to decide on the vote of NCM. With less than 24 hours for the decisive vote on the NCM, the UNF was confident of a sure defeat, while the JO pledged to win the motion with the support of the SLFP members in Government ranks. JVP Leader Anura Kumara Dissanayake, has also stated that they would vote in favour of the motion. JVP has six seats in Parliament.
TNA members could not reach a final decision on the NCM yesterday, even after having two group meetings, one in the morning and another in the evening at the Parliamentary Complex yesterday. The TNA would meet again at 10 am today, to come to a final decision. According to Parliamentary sources, some TNA MPs have proposed that the TNA should not take part in the NCM debate. Opposition Leader and TNA Leader R Sampanthan also met President Maithripala Sirisena yesterday afternoon.
The TNA has 16 MPs in the current Parliament, while UNF has 106 seats and UPFA has 96 seats. Out of the 96 MPs in the UPFA, 54 MPs are in the Opposition. The 106 seats in the UNF bloc includes 7 Sri Lanka Muslim Congress (SLMC) members led by Minister Rauf Hakeem, 5 All Ceylon Makkal Congress (ACMC) members led by Minister Rishad Bathiudeen, and another six members representing the parties of Mano Ganesan, V S Radhakrishnan and P Digambaram.
UNF National List MP Ven Athuraliye Rathana Thera and UPFA MP Chandrasiri Gajadeera acts as independent MPs in Parliament. Former Minister Dr Wijayadasa Rajapakshe is still a member of the UNF.
The party leaders of the UNF, who met at the Parliament complex yesterday, reinforced their position to vote against the motion. The SLFP members in the Government ranks were inclined towards voting in favour of the motion as at yesterday evening. However, there was a strong possibility of cross voting due to dissenting views within the parties.
Parliament officials said the Public and Speaker’s galleries would be open only to selected invitees during the debate. This is the 47th NCM and the third against a Prime Minister in Sri Lanka's Parliament history.
Previously, two NCMs had been submitted and taken for vote against former PMs late SWRD Bandaranaike in 1957 and Sirimavo Bandaranaike in 1975.
No Confidence Motion: A mad joke says, State Minister Harsha de Silva
Deputy Minister Harsha de Silva yesterday, dressed down certain ministers who were allegedly in support of the No Confidence Motion presented to Parliament by the Joint Opposition. Referring to the NCM as a “mad joke,” Dr. de Silva pointed out that if someone is not confident in one’s self, that person should step down from his or her post.
“If I was not sure of myself, I would have stepped down from my post! There is no issue there. Why would I ask someone else to bring in a no confidence motion against me? This is madness! We recently found out that there are such jokers with us,” an amused de Silva said.
Dr. de Silva also said that in recorded history of the world, no sitting government had so far brought in a no confidence motion against itself. “There is no problem in the Joint Opposition bringing in a no confidence motion against the government. That is perfectly understandable. The problem is with the persons who hold ministerial portfolios going around saying that we are not confident about our own government, so we are voting against it. My God, I don’t think this has happened anywhere in the world!” he said.
Dr. de Silva said that he was hundred percent sure that the government would defeat the no confidence motion on Wednesday.
He also said that they would present the restructuring proposals for the UNP by next Sunday.
"Our political party is a democratic one," he said. "It is not like your political party. Yours have a father, sons, uncles and brothers all in it. Ours is not like that. We have a democratic structure in our party. So we can make such proposals freely. Our leader have allowed us that," he added.
National Audit Bill presented to Parliament for First Reading
The National Audit Bill was presented to Parliament yesterday for First Reading.
Chief Government Whip and Minister Gayantha Karunathilake presented the Bill on behalf of the Prime Minister.
The Bill was published in the Gazette on March 16. The Bill provides for the powers, duties and functions of the Audit Service Commission. It also provides for the establishment of the office of the National Audit Office and the Sri Lanka State Audit Service. It specifies the role of the Auditor General over public finance.
The Bill was Gazetted incorporating the amendments proposed by the Cabinet Sub-Committee headed by Minister Dr Sarath Amunugama. As per the Gazetted Bill, the powers of surcharge have been vested under the Chief Accounting Officers (Ministry Secretaries and Department Heads).
The CAOs impose the surcharge against any person who is responsible for the deficiency or loss, either jointly or severally, followed by a formal disciplinary action by the Disciplinary Authority or a judicial process.
“The Audit Service Commission shall report the amount of any deficiency or loss in any transaction of an auditee entity if it had been made contrary to any written law and has caused any deficiency or loss due to fraud, negligence, misappropriation or corruption of those involved,” the Bill stated.
A Surcharge Appeal Committee comprising of five members would be appointed by the Constitutional Council to hear and determine appeals by any person against whom a surcharge had been imposed. The Bill states the Auditor General should not be a member of the Committee.
The JVP and several organizations, including Transparency International Sri Lanka, have already raised concerns over dilution of the Bill, especially with regard to the surcharge provisions.
The National Audit Bill was a key pre-election pledge of Common Candidate Maithripala Sirisena that was also included in the 100-day work programme of the Government. The final draft of the Bill was revised over 23 times, mainly due to contention over its surcharge provision.
State Minister of Finance Wickramaratne on pension taxes
If a person has worked for less than 20 years, there is no tax up to 2 million for a commuted pension. If it increases from Rs. 2 million to Rs. 3 million, then there would be a 5% income tax that would be charged. Anything beyond that would be subjected to a 10% tax.
If a person has worked for over 20 years, then there would be no tax imposed for up to Rs. 50 million and it would be completely tax free, said State Minister of Finance Eran Wickramaratne.
He said this in Parliament yesterday, in response to a question raised by MP Vasudeva Nanayakkara, with regard to the commuted pension under the Inland Revenue Act.
Meanwhile, MP Wimal Weerawansa, raised a question as to whether through this taxation, it would deter people from depositing their money in banks and also whether it would make people resort to other ways to hide their money.
In response, Minister Wickramaratne said people who have excess money may resort to devious ways to escape having to pay any type of taxes, but he said that due to interest rates, they would tend to invest. “Only a small percentage is taxed. I don’t see this as a big issue.
He noted that the government’s budget deficit target was 3.5 percent, but it had shot the mark by .5% due to inclement weather related issues. However, he said that currently, the government had managed to get the economy back on track, while ratings have indicated that in certain areas where we were negative, we have succeeded in making it stable in the ratings.”
With regard to the country’s foreign reserves, he said in 2017, it had grown by $ 2 billion. Export has also increased by 10% especially in the fisheries sector, due to the regaining of the GSP concession. He said direct foreign investment which was around $ 800 million, had increased two folds during 2017, making it the year with the highest foreign investment. The minister said the government hopes to increase it further in 2018.
Wickramaratne noted that according to the Central Bank report, inflation had shown signs of reduction. “The Central Bank report suggests a trend of reducing commodity prices, he said.
The minister said that the government had systematically spent the country’s taxes on education and health primarily.
For education and skills development in 2014, the government had spent 1.9% of the GDP. He said as a country with a smaller population, priority should be given to education. We intend to increase the allocation for education, higher education and skills development to 3% of the GDP by 2020.
In terms of health, the government intends to increase allocations up to around 2% of the GDP,” Minister Wickramaratne added.
