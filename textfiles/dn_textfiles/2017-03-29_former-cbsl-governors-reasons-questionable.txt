Former CBSL Governor's reasons questionable

The reasons given to the Tender Board by former CBSL Governor Arjun Mahendarn on the decision to accept 10.5 billion worth bids at the questioned Treasury Bond auction is debatable, the Presidential Commission inquiring into the Treasury Bond issue yesterday observed.
This observation was made when Deputy Governor ex-officio Tender Board Chairman P. Samarasiri explained details on the Tender Board meeting which was held on February 27, 2015.
Samarasiri commenting on the observation said every economic theory in fact is debatable.
Samarasiri explained to the Presidential Commission the telephone conversation he had with the former Governor Mahendran during the said Tender Board meeting with which he sought Mahendran’s reasoning to the questioned instructions.
“The former Governor said, we are going to remove 5% penal interest rate, once this is removed the interest rate structure will be brought back to pre 2014 September level. These are very technical reasons.He also said there is a lot of liquidity in the market and that the government has a borrowing requirement,” Samarasiri said.
Samarasiri also said when the Public Debt Department officials conveyed to him that former Governor Mahendran has instructed to accept 10 times the amount of bids advertised in the public notice, he felt angry.
Asked as to why he felt angry, Samarasiri said he felt angry because the other two Deputy Governors have accompanied the Governor to the PDD and have brought instructions to the Tender Board.
So I asked if a Governor can take decisions, what would be the purpose of having a Tender Board in the first place, Samarasiri said.
The Commission requested Samarasiri to explain his hypothesis as to why former Governor Mahendran did not directly communicate on the thirty year Treasury bond issuance to him, who happened to be the DG overlooking the PDD.
Samarasiri said during his long period in office as a public servant in the CBSL, he did not do ‘morning visits’ to any Governors’ office. Maybe that is why I was communicated on this via another Deputy Governor, Samarasiri said to the amusement of the audience present at the Commission.
Meanwhile asked on the amendments he had done to the Monetary Board minutes prepared by Secretary to the Monetary Board H.A. Karunaratne, DG Samarasiri said he did make some changes in order to put the decisions and the Governor in a better light. Samarasiri said the amendments were done based upon the impressions that he had on the discussion.
He also said he found Karunaratne’s minute keeping being not up to the standard.
“According to the Monetary Law Act, the minutes of the Tender Board are the responsibility of the Governor. The Deputy Governors are there to assist the secretary to the Monetary Board to prepare minutes,” he said.
Samarasiri was also asked whether the Tender Board decision was not a unanimous decision regarding the questioned Treasury bond issuance. He replied that unless the Tender Board members voiced their concerns, a Governor’s decision is the Tender Board’s decision as well.
Additional Solociter General Yasantha Kodagoda asked if any member of the Tender Board voiced their serious concerns regarding Mahendran’s decision, Samarasiri said there was not much confrontation apart from Dr.Asim and ASPD Mutugala who requested to contact Governor Mahendran on the matter.
ASG Kodagoda asked if AG S.S. Ratnayake voiced his serious concerns regarding the matter. Samarasiri said there was no such confrontation.
ASG Kodagoda then asked Samarasiri if S.S.Ratnayake said that it would have been better if they were shot at or they were pressed to walk naked than agreeing with the decision, Samarasiri said he was very sure that Ratnayake did not say anything as such at the said Tender Board meeting.
The Commission also asked whether Samarasiri was aware that the Perpetual Treasuries CEO Arjun Alosius was the son-in-law of former Governor Mahendran. Samarasiri said he did not know until the media broke the news after the questioned Treasury bond auction.
The Assistant Governor S.S.Ratnayake is to appear before the Presidential Commission today.
Additional Solociter General Yasantha Kodagoda and Senior State Counselor Dr.Avanti Perera led evidence.
