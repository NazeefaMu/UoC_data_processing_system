Doing business made difficult.....

The Budget 2016 presented by Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayake has drawn attention from diverse groups. As a tax consultant, I write my perspective on certain significant budget proposals presented in Budget 2016.
Sri Lanka has made it difficult to register and carry out a business by paying annual fees on every company registered with the Registrar of Companies will be subject to an Annual License fee of:
Leaving aside the quoted and other companies, Rs. 60,000 is a high fee for a small company and also discouraging the SME sector.We have to think that these companies have to pay their Auditors and Company Secretaries too.
- Private Companies Rs. 60,000 - Public Quoted Companies Rs. 500,000 - Others Rs. 100,000 (including companies non-functioning)
The annual cost of running companies which is very high. The priority given for SME’s rather than big companies should be appreciated.
SME’s sector can be considered the back bone of the economy, as you know it creates more job opportunities and plays a dominant role in the economy.
This will not be a positive and encouraging move for a person to register a company and get into a business.
The 50% rate deduction available under the Inland Revenue Act for listing in the CSE will be extended by increasing the present deadline of April 1, 2017 for further;
(i) 2 years for listing in CSE; or (ii) 3 years for listing in any foreign stock exchanges
By considering the above incentive for small companies to go for listings at any moment the company may go for listing but they will have to pay Rs. 500,000. My personal opinion is to look into those provisions seriously at the point of drafting the amending Act to ensure this.
Another bad situation is the fees are even payable even if a company is not functioning. It is my understanding that there are about 25,000 companies which are non-operative as per the Registrar of Companies.
Another discouraging factor is, at the time of company’s voluntary liquidation Rs. 250,000 will be charged on liquidation.
All the hoteliers are expected to register with the Tourism Development Authority. From a tax point of view, the 1% Tourism Development levy will be removed. However the increasing rate of VAT and NBT will directly affect the service charges of the hotel industries.
The above revenue proposals are not practicable as far as SME’s sector is concerned. Finally the Budget 2016 has introduced nine new levies altogether.
They are the Company Annual License Fee, Voluntary Liquidation Fee, Emission Levy, Vehicle Valuation Certificate Fee, Unregistered Vehicle to be Registered fee, Vehicle Entitlement fee, fine on road accidents, a charge will be imposed on airlines on the sale of international tickets and Local Council nominal fee.
