‘Prisons intelligence unit failed to control narcotics use in prisons’

Justice and Prison Reforms Minister Thalatha Athukorala said she had decided to disband the prison intelligence unit as it had failed to control the use of narcotics inside prisons and inmates coordinating crimes with the use of mobile phones.
“The continuation of prison intelligence unit cannot be justified if inmates have access to narcotics and mobile phones in the prison and continue to engage in crimes” she said speaking to Journalists after a UNP council meeting in Ratnaputa recently.
The Minister said she had received a number of complaints about the intelligence unit and added the department too had failed to take action at times based on the unit’s findings. While noting that the intelligence unit of the prison has been unable to control the wrongdoings inside the prison, the minister said she no saw reason to continue with a unit which has failed. The minister said she will soon take a decision whether to continue with the prison intelligence unit or not. On implementing the death penalty, the minister said the government has not arrived at a final decision. She said more information was needed to arrive at a final decision on inmates who have continued their illegal drug business after being sentenced to death for drug offences. “First we have to compile a list of prisoners who have been sentenced to death for drug offences. Then we need to get records with regards to their cases from the Attorney General’s Department. After this we will decide about the next step” she said.
Meanwhile, commenting on the recruitment of a hangman to the Prisons Department, the minister said several individuals had come forward for the job and some have said they are willing to do it even without any payment.
