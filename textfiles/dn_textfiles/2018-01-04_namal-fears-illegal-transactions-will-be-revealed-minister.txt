Namal fears that illegal transactions will be revealed : Minister

Health and Indigenous Medicine Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne said MP Namal Rajapaksa is skeptical about the foreign visits of FCID officials because he fears that all their illegal transactions based in foreign countries will be revealed.
The minister made these remarks at the Cabinet press conference yesterday at the Government Information Department, responding to a question raised by a journalist about MP Namal Rajapaksa’s statement that if they come to power, necessary action would be taken against FCID officials over their frequent foreign trips.
“The FCID has already found several documents related to their transactions in foreign countries such as Dubai. We will reveal the full details of the transactions soon. Once their account details are revealed, we will see how they come to power,” he said.
He further said that they are often questioning about it because they wanted to know the progress made by the FCID and what transactions they have found so far.
When asked about the GMOA's recent objection to the decision made by the appointed committee with regard to the SAITM issue, Minister Senaratne said the GMOA was also a part of it and that they unanimously agreed to the decision.
“We shall see if they start a strike or a protest. It is the view of the GMOA, not all doctors. They first agreed to the decisions and now they seem to oppose,” he said.
Dr. Harsha de Silva and the committee comprised of the Sri Lanka Medical Council (SLMC), Higher Education Ministry, Health Ministry and GMOA, Medical Faculty Lecturers Association and the Medical Faculty Students' Parents Association were the observers.
He said by January 15, the final transaction pertaining to the SAITM issue will be completed. Minister Senaratne said it is the responsibility of the SLMC to decide on what needs to be done to the students and that has no connection with Dr. Silva’s committee.
“Therefore, the SLMC decided that the students need to undergo training for nearly eight months covering the specialties and subspecialties. The registration will be provided after conducting an oral exam to test the standard of students,” he said.
