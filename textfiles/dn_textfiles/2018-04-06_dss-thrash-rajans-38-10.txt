DSS thrash Rajans 38-10

Two brilliant tries apiece scored by captain Chamuka Seshan and Hasidu Dinusha brought D.S. Senanayake College a smashing 38 points (6 tries, 4 conversions) to 10 (2 tries) win over Dharmaraja College Kandy in their Singer ‘A’ division inter-schools league rugby tournament first round game played at Navy grounds in Welisara yesterday. At lemons DSS led 24-5.
D.S. Senanayake fought like terriers in the entire match combining effectively with their forwards and backs giving no room for their opponents. Dharmaraja collapsed following relentless pressure from the entire DSS outfit.
