‘National Protest Day tomorrow’

The National Protest Day organised by the Anti-SAITM People’s Barricade will be held countrywide tomorrow. The event aims at opening the eyes and ears of the Government, Government Medical Officers’ Association (GMOA) Secretary Dr. Haritha Aluthge said.
Addressing the media at the GMOA Headquarters in Colombo yesterday, he said raising awareness of the public and the launch of the poster campaign will take place today at Lipton Circus, Colombo. The GMOA will extend the fullest support to the anti-SAITM organisation, he said.
Inter-Company Employees’ Union President Wasantha Samarasinghe said the end of the Government will be marked by the SAITM issue.
The Government should solve the issue without pushing the country into a general strike. Nobody demanded the Government to take over the Dr. Neville Fernando Hospital. It is maintained with the tax money of the people, he said.
Samarasinghe said the people have joined hands against SAITM. It is not a minor protest by a group of individuals. Over 8,000 medical students have not attended lectures for eight months. About 600 lecturers do not conduct lectures for medical students, he said.
Black flags will be hoisted in protest of SAITM. Anti-SAITM walks, protests and leaflet distribution campaigns will take place countrywide, he said.
