Depression moving away from Colombo

The depression in the Arabian Sea to the west of Sri Lanka, which was only 600km away from Colombo yesterday, is gradually moving away from the country, the Meteorology Department said in a weather advisory.
The Met Department said that since the depression was moving away, the effect it has on Sri Lanka will also gradually lessen.
Several spells of thundershowers are forecasted for the Eastern Province, in the Hambantota and Matara districts. Showers are also expected in the North Western, Central and Sabaragamuwa Provinces and in Galle and Anuradhapura in the evening hours. Under the influence of this system, it is likely that wind speed over the seas may pick up suddenly up to 80kmph off the coast, extending from Puttalam to Matara via Colombo and Galle.
Temporary strong gusty winds are expected and rough seas may prevail.
