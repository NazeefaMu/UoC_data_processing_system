Showbiz daredevil

Alcohol, tobacco smoking and dangerous drugs are the three substances that come under the theme substance abuse. Of these alcohol and tobacco smoking have been abused by notable characters, often the key protagonists in many Sri Lanka, Indian and Western films. The risks and the dangers of substance abuse are well known. The reasons why people drink alcohol or smoke are connected with individual, social and economic reasons or may be a mixture of all these factors.
Tension may be a precipitating factor especially in a commercialised society where there is competition in all aspects of social involvement. It is a common saying that people take a drink for anything. They drink when they are happy, sorry, cold, warm or idle. Idle man's mind is like a devil's workshop. So why not take a drink or light a cigarette. The social effects of substance abuse are ill health, economic degradation, poverty, family disruption and early death. These are caused by addiction (compulsive drinking/smoking/harmful drug use).
In all the films the destructive aspects of substance abuse are shown. In the well known India film Devadas one could have observed the cruel fate of the protogonist Nageswera Rao in the Tamil version and Sharouk Khan in the Hindi version. In Sinhala films like Parasatu Mal, Dahasak Situvili and Ektam Ge the protogonists lapse into substance abuse, mainly to smoking and alcohol abuse from unsolved individual tensions and problems in life.
Emotional instability, frustration and lack of confidence leading to mental disequilibrium could be the immediate causes. Drinking or smoking or combined drinking and smoking have become a life style in Dahasak Situvili, Ektam Ga and Parasatumal because of disrupted sensual attachments.
Even in the world famous films like The Robe and BenHur scenes of drinking are shown. Emperor Niro drinking wine while Rome was on fire is well known.
In Who’s Afraid of Virginia, Woolf the key protogonists including Elisebeth Tayler behave abnormally and furiously. Creative films are not documentaries on substance abuse, but cinematic creations and the inclusion of scenes of substance abuse has been essential for character development and the cumulative aesthetic impact of the film concerned.
One should not expect all characters to be saints observing the five precepts. But an intelligent audience would no doubt understand the evil effects of substance abuse even just by merely seeing such a film. Such films offer a powerful message against substance abuse.
In Trisulsdeepa Tabawita's cinematic creation Putandia the subject of substance abuse is the basic issue. The preventive and protective role of a father to save his son from substance abuse is very successfully displayed in this film.
The handsome young protogonist Hemal Ranasingha in the Aadaranya Kathavak (Melody of Love) displays mental and physicla deterioration in health in a large measure. There are several scenes of smoking and alcohol abuse.
The audience quite appropriately enjoy this film with a great sympathy towards the protogonist's fate. The structure and organisation of the film have been quite impressive with the use of new technology and novel cinematic techniques. But the National Tobacco and Alcohol Authority has unsuccessfully made an appeal to courts for a ban on this film blaming that it promoted alcohol and tobacco abuse. The untimely death of the protogonist in this film because of smoking and alcohol abuse itself, is a powerful message against substance abuse.
There are statutary bodies, rules and regulations, special projects/programmes legal provisions and religious and voluntary organisations aimed at preventing substance abuse. While heroin, cannibis, opium, and hashish etc are banned drugs, alcohol and tobacco are not banned but discouraged from use. Successive governments have been increasing taxation on alcohol and tobacco. Messages of warning are printed on cigarette packs. As well as on electronic media scenes showing the use of alcohol and smoking.
The Poisons, Opium and Dangerous Drugs Odinace is in action. A person in possession of over two grams of heroin can be sentenced to death. But still, the media report almost daily on the seizure of contraband by Customs officers.
There is a substance abuse depenmdence syndrome affecting the constant users of abused substances. The users are overpowered to continue using the abused substance. Withdrawal symptoms appear if they give up the abused substance.
They need increasing dose of the substance to experience the same effect. This is called tolererance. Taking the abused substance becomes the priority desire over other desires in ones life. These features have been well shown in the protogonist in Adaraneya Kothavak as well as in many other films of the past.
