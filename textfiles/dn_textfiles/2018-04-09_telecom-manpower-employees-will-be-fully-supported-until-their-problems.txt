Telecom manpower employees will be fully supported until their problems resolved: Rajitha

Health, Nutrition and Indigenous Medicine Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne promised his full support to Telecom manpower employees until their problems are completely resolved.
He said problems faced by these employees should be settled step by step.
Although Telecom is a private company, it operated on its own without being a burden on the government.
Dr. Senaratne was addressing a meeting held at the BMICH, Colombo to mark the absorption of 452 Telecom manpower employees to the permanent cadre of the company recently. Dr. Senaratne, who said that communication was an integral part of the government’s development effort, added that the balance 1,000 manpower workers in Telecom should also be granted job permanency.
“Discussion was the best means to resolve problems. Chairman of Telecom is the brother of President Maithripala Sirisena and he should use the sword in his hand in the proper manner,” the Minister said.
Dr. Senaratne said that the system of deploying workers on contract basis was first started by the Bank of Ceylon .
“As a politician and trade union leader, he had taken an active part in getting them absorbed into the permanent cadre. Bank of Ceylon contract workers obtained permanent status after a struggle. Telecom manpower workers too obtained job permanency after a struggle. However, Chairman of Telecom had promised to absorb all manpower workers into the permanent cadre by the end of 2019,” the Minister said.
“Now their salaries should be increased as they contributed towards bringing the yahapalana government into power,” the Minister said.
Dr. Senaratne said the manner the company recruited manpower workers was questionable. They were fully aware about the sources which gained financially from it.
These sources earlier loved money more than the country. They waited for the opportune time and defeated the previous regime to steer the country on the correct path rather than to install another leader,” he said.
He said the government had performed that duty and brought about a clear change for the better.
Sri Lanka Telecom Chairman Kumarasinghe Sirisena and the members of the Board of Directors and Telecom employees were present.
