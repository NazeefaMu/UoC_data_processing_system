[Parliament– (22-03-2017)]

New legislation for flexibility on Treasury Bond limits
The government will bring in new legislation concerning the issue of Treasury Bills and Treasury Bonds to provide for flexibility in raising higher or lesser amounts than specified in the Order published in the Gazette, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said.
The Premier was responding to a question by MEP Leader Dinesh Gunawardena in Parliament yesterday.
He said the same legislation would declare legal all the Treasury Bills and Bonds that have been issued so far including private placements. He said the Legal Draftsman has been asked to draft the legislation while the Attorney General has been asked to look at it. “The Treasury Bills are governed by the Registered Stock and Securities Ordinance of 1939. Under that, the Finance Minister should specify by Order published in the Gazette as to how much to be raised, the modes of raising, the rates and all the details in respect of each loan. According to the Ordinance, loans can be raised only after the Order is Gazetted. However, it transpired in the Presidential Commission that we have not followed it for some time.
In fact, we have been raising the loans and Gazetting them only at the end of the year. This has started from 1999. I found that the loans that were authorized by former Minister K N Choksy were Gazetted by Dr. Sarath Amunugama as the subject minister in a different government. This is the procedure that has been going on for a long time,” he pointed out.
“This is not very satisfactory. On the whole, the legislation is also not very satisfactory because it was done in 1939. The flexibility has to be there to raise a larger or lesser amount when the issue is taking place,” he added.
“Once the minister takes a decision to raise money through Treasury Bills or Bonds, it would be advertised in the papers as of the new procedure to be set up by the new legislation,” said the Premier.
He said Parliament could also be informed about these advertisements. “The new legislation will give the flexibility of raising the same amounts specified, or lesser or higher amounts than that. The legislation will provide for two other issues. One is declaring legal all the Treasury Bills that have been issued so far. If not, some people may challenge them by saying we raised the money before the Gazette was issued and therefore they were not legal.
The other issue is the private placements. When this government came we made a public commitment not to have private placements but to go for public auctions or use some other transparent system. Nevertheless, private placements have taken place and it came out in the inquiries that there had been no formal decision even on private placements. Therefore the same legislation will make all bonds issued on private placements legal. Otherwise someone might challenge the Central Bank before courts when we go to redeem the bonds,” he pointed out.
Cabinet nod for H’tota Port Joint Venture and industrial zone
The Cabinet yesterday unanimously approved the Hambantota Port Joint Venture and setting up of an industrial zone attached to it, Special Projects Minister Dr. Sarath Amunugama said in Parliament yesterday.
He was speaking at an adjournment debate on the state of economy moved by MEP Leader Dinesh Gunawardena.
Dr. Amunugama, who was the Chairman of the six-member Ministerial Committee appointed to finalise the agreements related to the Hambantota Port joint venture, said the Hambantota port would be developed as a leading international port in the region.
He said the Cabinet approval in this regard was a historical milestone concerning the economic development of the country. He said the proposed industrial zone in down south would house 400 industries, adding that it would be made the largest industrial zone in South Asia.
He said as per the joint venture agreement, China Merchant will hold 80 percent stake, while the balance 20 percent will be held by the Sri Lankan Government. However, he said after the lapse of five months, 20 percent of equities will be available in the share market.
“Within five months, we can reduce 80 percent stake of the China Merchant company to 60 percent. We can up our stake upto 40 percent. The Joint Venture will be operated by a locally registered company. Security related activities in the port will be handled by the Sri Lanka Navy,” he said.
The minister said USD 3.5 billion out of USD 7 billion foreign reserves the former Government boasted about belonged to the US based Templeton Fund. The economic development the former Government claimed to have achieved was based on US money,” Dr. Amunugama said.
PM questions JO members on opposing govt
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe yesterday queried Joint Opposition members as to why they would not sit with the government in Parliament if they agree with President Maithripala Sirisena.
The Prime Minister made this observation yesterday in response to MP Dinesh Gunawardena in Parliament who questioned as to how a minister agreed to set up a hybrid Court and appoint foreign judges to courts of Sri Lanka, breaching the Constitution. He said the President had to make a contradictory statement that he would not appoint foreign judges.
“Why don’t you come and sit with the government if you agree with the President,” the Prime Minister said responding to MP Gunawardena.
“We have not breached the Constitution and had not agreed to set up a hybrid court or to appoint foreign judges. We have sought experts to participate as observers,” he said.
Prime Minister Wickremesinghe said according to the Constitution, judges should be Sri Lankans.
“The people have given us mandate. We assure that we would abide by the Constitution,” he said.
Govt will take more loans: PM
The Government will have to obtain more loans given the current state of affairs of the economy. It will make sure that it is in a position to service the debt obtained after 2015, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said.
He was making an overview of the country’s debt situation in Parliament yesterday in reply to a question by UPFA MP Ranjith de Zoysa. The Prime Minister said plans have been made to increase income from exports and the tourism industry. He said new investments and regaining of GSP trade concession would be beneficial to this end.
Prime Minister Wickremesinghe said the Government strives to uplift the country’s economy to a position that it could service the debt of the former Government by 2020. He said the Government has no plan to sell state owned institutions, but added private sector investments would be sought to generate income from them.
“The Government wants Rs. 11,000 billion to service debt from 2017 to 2026. The Government revenue mechanism will be strengthened by systematising the tax collection process. While maintaining government income at expected levels, we would take measures to prevent the increase of recurrent expenditure. We are introducing financial management methods for that purpose. We aim at bringing down the budget deficit to 3.5 percent of the GDP in 2020,” he said.
The Prime Minister said the debt of the country stood at Rs. 8503.2 billion as at December 31, 2015. Of that amount, Rs. 4,959.2 billion was local debt, while Rs. 3,544 billion was foreign debt.
The total debt was 77.6 percent of the Gross Domestic Product. The government had spent Rs. 1318 billion as loan resettlement instalments in 2015. That amount was 91 percent of the national income, he said.
During the last 10 years, the National Water Supply and Drainage Board, Road Development Authority, Shipping Corporation, Sri Lanka Land Reclamation and Development Corporation, Srilankan Airlines, Petroleum Corporation and the Ceylon Electricity Board had obtained direct loans from the Hatton National Bank, People’s Bank and DFCC Bank. Those loans are not included in the total public debt percentage, he said.
In 2005, the total public debt stood at Rs. 2,222 billion. When the war was over in 2009, the amount had increased to Rs. 4,361 billion. At the end of 2014, the figure had risen to Rs. 7,391 billion. The public debt had increased by Rs. 3,230 billion from 2009 to 2014. None was aware as to how and why the public debt had increased by Rs. 3,230 billion during the post war period because the amount of loans taken at the time of the war was much less than that, the Prime Minister said.
“When the new government came to power in 2015, many hidden details pertaining to those loans came to light. We found that information of loans took by the public institutions were not included in the public debt system. The amount excluded from the public debt system was Rs. 960.8 billion - the CPC had taken Rs. 365 billion, Ports Authority Rs. 260 billion, SriLankan Airlines Rs. 212 billion, the list is too long,” he said.
The Sri Lanka Transport Board had not sent Rs. 13 billion it should have sent to the EPF and the ETF of its contributions. Departments and Ministries owe further Rs. 58.4 billion. Of that amount, Rs. 24 billion owed by the Highways Ministry, he said.
The Government launched a public awareness campaign through print and electronic media to inform the public of the debt situation of the country. The cost of that campaign was 0.0005 percent of the total loans taken from 2005 to 2014,” Prime Minister Wickremesinghe said replying to a supplementary question by MP Ranjith de Zoysa.
The previous government never informed Parliament of the loans it had taken, neither it reported of the loans and included them in due records.
It shows the then government’s financial management was arbitrary. The previous government by not informing public representatives in Parliament of its financial activities, humiliated Parliament’s supremacy over public finance,” the Prime Minister said.
Govt rescued country from ‘economic volcano’: Ravi
The previous government handed over the country to them with an economy that resembled a volcano. The government has brought the country to a better level even reducing the prices of 22 essential commodities while increasing salaries, Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayake said.
He made these observations yesterday joining the adjournment debate moved by Joint Opposition Parliamentary Group Leader Dinesh Gunawardena on the economic situation of the country.
The minister said the prices of petrol, diesel, milk powder, gas and many other commodities have been reduced. “The people have forgotten them. The previous government took loans and pointed them out as foreign investments. We have had to pay those loans, Karunanayake said.
He questioned as to how institutions pay taxes if they face economic difficulties. He said no one is jumping into rivers due to economic difficulties like during previous regimes.
He said Bandula Gunawardena has become a liar before the committee hearing the bond issue. Joint Opposition members are talking without fear because of five star democracy.
“Only 11 projects were implemented during Mahinda Rajapaksa’s period. But during these two years, we have commenced 31 projects. That is the change,” Minister Karunanayake said.
He said when the Government is engaged in discussions, it is a problem for Sunil Handunnetti and his party members. “When we talk to China, the Opposition worries,” the minister said.
“We have enough money. But we can’t spend them to settle loans,” he said.
Anura Kumara queries on defence pact with US
Chief Opposition Whip and JVP Leader Anura Kumara Dissanayake yesterday in Parliament demanded to know whether the government intends to extend the defence pact with the US, signed in 2007 for another 10 years.
Raising a question under Standing Order 23 (2), MP Dissanayake said the Acquisition and Cross-Services Agreement signed by then US Ambassador to Sri Lanka Robert O Blake and former Defence Secretary Gotabhaya Rajapaksa was to end on March 5, 2017, and queried whether the government has plans to renew it.
“As of the agreement, we are bound to allow the US military to use our land, sea and air space during a war in the region and to provide them with infrastructure facilities. We have no choice but to be a US ally during a war situation,” he said.
The MP asked the government to inform the House on the content of the agreement prior to signing it.
Leader of the House and Minister Lakshman Kiriella said the reply to the question would be given today.
Dinesh quizzes govt’s stance on hybrid courts
Joint Opposition Parliamentary Group Leader Dinesh Gunawardena queried if the government would continue to agree the UNHRC to set up hybrid courts, violating Constitutional provisions to hunt War Heroes.
He made these observations yesterday making a special statement under standing order 23 (2) querying if the Government had agreed with a proposal to set up a hybrid court comprising foreign judges to probe war crimes and to extend the period for the proposals included in the cosponsored resolution before the UNHRC in 2015.
The UNHRC with the Sri Lankan Government cosponsored resolution in 2015 with a proposal inimical to the latter.
He said it included proposals to set up a hybrid court comprising foreign judges to probe war crimes, violating Constitutional provisions to hunt War Heroes.
“I quote from the resolution,” MP Dinesh Gunawardena said. “Take note with appreciation the oral update presented by the High Commissioner to the Human Rights Council at its 27th session, the report of the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights on promoting reconciliation and accountability in Sri Lanka and the report of its investigation on Sri Lanka requested in Human Rights Council, including its findings and conclusions, and encourages the Government of Sri Lanka to implement the recommendations.”
He said that the paragraph six of the resolution reads as follows. “Independent judicial and prosecutorial institutions led by individuals known for integrity and impartiality; and further affirms in this regard the importance of participation in a Sri Lankan judicial mechanism, including the Special Counsel’s office, of Commonwealth and other foreign judges, defence lawyers, and authorised prosecutors and investigators.”
Gunawardena questioned if the Prime Minister knew that the Joint Opposition objected this section and even President Maithripala Sirisena had stated that he would not appoint foreign judges and foreign lawyers into a Court.
He asked if the Prime Minister agreed.
The validity period of the 2015 resolution on Sri Lanka before the UNHRC is to be over in March 2017, Gunawardena said.
“We want to know if the government would agree the period of the resolution be extended along with the proposals, including those that are against the country’s Constitution,” he said.
Country facing monetary crisis: Dinesh
The country is facing an unprecedented monetary crisis, Joint Opposition Parliamentary Group Leader Dinesh Gunawardena said yesterday. He said measures taken by the unity government to develop the economy have proved a failure.
The only option it had was to sell public institutions. He demanded to know as to what means the government would take to develop the economy of the country. MP Gunawardena made these observations moving an adjournment motion in Parliament.
He said the development rate of the economy is 4.6 percent.
It was 6.5 percent when the country was handed over to the incumbent government in 2015.
The exchange rate of the US dollar was Rs. 132 in 2015 January. It has increased to Rs. 156, Gunawardena said.
He said the government has decided to sell State institutions like the National Water Supply and Drainage Board, Ceylon Petroleum Corporation, Ceylon Electricity Board, Ports Authority.
He said the Deputy Governor of the Central Bank too has warned the government that it would have to face an economic crisis.
He questioned as to what was the government’s latest modus operandi to face the crisis.
‘Non-grant of bail to remanded MPs limits their service’
Joint Opposition Parliamentary Group Leader Dinesh Gunawardane yesterday informed Speaker Karu Jayasuriya that non-grant of bail to Parliamentarians who are in remand custody has become a problem to carry out their duties in the House.
He requested the Speaker to look into the matter.
Although MP Gunawardhane did not mention the name of an MP when he made the request from the Speaker, some members were heard telling the name of MP Weerawansa who is in remand custody.
Speaker Jayasuriya responding to the request said he had begun to discuss the issue with the relevant persons.
