Export agricultural crop cultivation should be done in proper manner: Minister Daya Gamage

For cultivators to derive maximum benefits:
The cultivation of export agricultural crops should be done according to a proper plan if the cultivators are to derive the maximum benefits from their pursuits, including a good income, said Primary Industries Minister Daya Gamage, when he visited the Export Crops Department’s farm at Walpita during an inspection tour recently.
The Minister who said his Ministry was taking every possible step to develop the export agriculture industry, said beds should be properly prepared before planting cinnamon, cardamom and other crop varieties. Nursery beds should include proper covers to manage the effects of sunlight.
The ultimate objective should be to derive maximum returns from the investment.
