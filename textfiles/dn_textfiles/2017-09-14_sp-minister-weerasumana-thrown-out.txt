SP minister Weerasumana thrown out

Following a directive from Southern Province Governor Dr. Hemakumara Nanayakkara, Southern Province Chief Minister Shan Wijayalal De Silva was sworn in as Provincial Minister of Sports and Youth Affairs, Rural Development, Cultural and Art Affairs, Social Welfare, Probation and Child Care Services, Women’s Affairs, Home Economic Enhancement, Housing and Constructions, and Manpower and Employment at the Governor’s Secretariat yesterday.
Accordingly, Weerasumana Weerasinghe was cast out of his ministerial portfolios held by him.
The Chief Minister is also the Provincial Minister of Finance, Planning, Law and Order, Engineering Services, Health, Indigenous Medicine, Local Government, Transport and Tourism.
Following the new appointment, he also has the above ministries formerly held by Weerasumana Weerasinghe.
Commenting on his decision to expel the former minister, the governor said that any councillor, once he or she was appointed as a minister, is bound and obliged to uphold the collectiveness and unity of the Cabinet, and has to perform his responsibilities and obligations to the utmost benefit of the people of the province.
“A minister is expected to carry out the policies and development plans of the government. He is not supposed to work according to his personal political views with regard to the affairs of the council. If a minister fails to fulfill the aspirations of the people as the Governor of the Province, I am constitutionally empowered to take a suitable decision over the member of the Cabinet. Hence, I had to take a decision over the controversial conduct of the former minister during the past few months,” the governor said.
Provincial Ministers U. G. D. Ariyathilake, Chandima Rasaputra and H. W. Gunasena were also sworn in front of Chief Minister on the occasion.
Former Minister Weerasumana Weerasinghe contested on the United People’s Freedom Alliance (UPFA) ticket at the 2014 Southern Provincial Council election and was elected to the council from the Matara district.
He is a member of the Communist Party. He had taken part in the Provincial Cabinet meeting held yesterday just a few hours before his dismissal unaware of the developments which were taking place regarding his ministerial portfolio. He had come to know about his dismissal while he was at his ministry at Dhakshina Paya yesterday, taking part in the public day activities.
However, when the 20th Amendment to the Constitution was moved at the Provincial Council Meeting, he had voted against it, joining hands with the Joint Opposition loyalists of the council. Commenting over his dismissal, the sacked minister told the media that he was not bothered about the removal and he was satisfied over his performances as Provincial Minister for he could render a remarkable service to the people of the South as the Provincial Minister.
