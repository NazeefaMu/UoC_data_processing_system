Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe: 40 years of uninterrupted political journey

Prime Minister Wickremesinghe marks his 40 years of uninterrupted political life this year having entered the parliament in 1977.
The Premier hosted a celebratory meeting at Temple Trees on Saturday (22) for all members of the Biyagama UNP Bala Mandalaya in appreciation of their support rendered to him for entering parliament and paid his gratitude to all who supported him in his 40 years of uninterrupted political journey.
After joining the United National Party (UNP), he was appointed as the chief organiser of the Kelaniya Electorate in the mid-1970s. He was later appointed as the chief organiser of the Biyagama Electorate, which he won in 1977 July parliamentary elections.
He was appointed Foreign Affairs Deputy Minister in the new government of J. R. Jayewardene, and was soon promoted to the post of Youth Affairs and Employment Minister, which made him the youngest Cabinet Minister of Sri Lanka.
During his term as Deputy Minister, he initiated the Sri Lanka National Guard and the National Youth Services Council (NYSCO), which provide vocational and career training to school leavers. Wickremesinghe was later made the Minister of Education.
Under the Presidency of Ranasinghe Premadasa, Wickremesinghe was appointed as the Minister of Industry, under which he initiated industrial reforms and established the Biyagama Special Economic Zone. He was appointed the Leader of the House in 1989. On May 7, 1993, Wickremesinghe was sworn in as Prime Minister after President Ranasinghe Premadasa was assassinated by the LTTE and Prime Minister D. B. Wijetunga was appointed Acting President.
He held the post again in 2001 and 2015, before assuming office for the fourth time in 2016.
Several events have been planned to celebrate the Prime Minister's significant achievements and a special parliamentary sitting has been organised to mark the milestone in early August.
Many religious events too have been planned to bless the Prime Minister.
A special religious programme was held yesterday at the Kelaniya Raja Maha Viharaya and a special Bodhi Pooja at the Kandy Dalada Maligawa will be held in early August.
