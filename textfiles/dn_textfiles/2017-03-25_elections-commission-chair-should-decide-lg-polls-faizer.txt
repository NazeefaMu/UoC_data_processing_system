Elections Commission Chair should decide on LG polls: Faizer

The decision to hold the Local Government election should be taken by the Elections Commission Chairman as the gazette notification regarding the demarcation of electoral boundaries is out, Local Government and Provincial Councils Minister Faizer Mustapha said.
The government has no intention of postponing the Local Government election though certain persons accuse that the government keeps postponing the LG polls.
However, the process of demarcating of electoral boundaries took a certain period of time, he said.
“I was instructed to take measures to hold the LG polls soon by the President,” he said. However, the minister said that there are a few amendments to be made to the demarcation report. The amendments will be forwarded to the Cabinet," Minister Mustapha said.
According to him, LG polls will be held in a few months after solving issues regarding the demarcation of electoral boundaries in local government wards. Around 2,000 proposals and appeals with regard to the demarcation have been considered.
"The suggestions sent by the main political parties with regard to the boundary definitions had to be considered," he said.
The minister said elections for Provincial Councils will be held on time once the terms of the Provincial Councils come to an end.
When asked by the media whether more women will be provided opportunities to contest at the LG pols, Minister Musthapa said he will receive instruction in this regard from the Attorney General within the next two weeks. He said the LG polls will be held under the new electoral system since the Local Government Act has been revised.
