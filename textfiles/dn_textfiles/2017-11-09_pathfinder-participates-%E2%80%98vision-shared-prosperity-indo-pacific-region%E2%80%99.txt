Pathfinder participates at ‘Vision for Shared Prosperity  in Indo-Pacific Region’ seminar in New Delhi

The United Service Institution of India (USI) under the directorship of Lieutenant General PK Singh organized its annual seminar on first week of November 2017 at New Delhi on the theme of, “From Contest to Cooperation: A Vision for Shared Prosperity in the Indo-Pacific Region”.
The seminar was aimed at bringing together varying perspectives on mapping of Blue Economy and its sustainable development, debate evolving security environment and its impact on peace and development and proposes measures for building viable collective economic and security architectures in a win – win paradigm.
General Dr. VK Singh, Minister of State for External affairs was the chief guest and delivered the key note address.
The minister highlighted the need to move from contest to cooperation for the progress of the region and strengthening regional forums and institutions to address the maritime security concerns in the Indian Ocean Region.
The term Blue Economy refers to a sustainable ocean based economic model that is largely dependent on coastal and marine ecosystems and resources. Harnessing of Blue Economy entails use of environmentally sound and innovative infrastructure, technologies, and practices including institutional and financing arrangements. Urbanization, pollution, over-exploitation, and climate change can be detrimental to the sustenance of a balanced coastal ecosystem.
There is a growing awareness in the world today that we need to be careful about exploiting the ocean based economy, as we cannot afford to damage the very ocean that is our lifeline. There is renewed understanding about the oceans as a key natural source for national as well as regional economies. This understanding has led to increased concern about ecological health and sustainability of oceans. This has compelled number of states to take measures to study the economic value of the oceans and to take measures to protect them.
The Indo-Pacific Region (IPR) combines Indian Ocean and Pacific Ocean. Multifaceted globalization has ensured that developments from the Suez Canal to the Sea of Japan or from African shores of the Indian Ocean to the western Pacific are strongly interrelated and mutually dependent. Owing to its overwhelming importance the IPR is termed as the “Indo-Pacific Pivot”. The region encompasses almost half of the world population, three of the ten largest economies, more than fifth of world GDP, 1/3 of world exports and half of the world’s maritime tonnage.
It is home to an enormously populous and diverse mix of ethnicities, cultures, political systems, religions, and economic models. The region is the maritime trade highway of the world and combines Southeast Asian states with the western Pacific, functioning as the throat of sea routes punctuated by Strait of Malacca, Sunda, Lombok and Makassar.
At least 40 per cent of the world’s sea borne trade, 50 percent of its container traffic and 70 percent of the traffic in hydrocarbon products transits through the region. Almost 68 percent of India’s, 80 percent of China’s and 25 percent of the US’ oil is shipped through the IOR. Uninterrupted flow of oil, natural resources, and goods is extremely crucial for developing economies, like India and China. The IPR has huge potential for harnessing its Blue Economy.
The seminar focused on:
1. To cross-fertilize different perspectives on the security and economic challenges and cooperation clearly bringing out the convergences and divergences between various stake holders.
2. To develop a nuanced understanding of the existing and emerging economic and security architectures and examine their efficacy to boost strategic trust and foster cooperation.
3. To provide inputs to respective governments and institutions for review and reframing of policies and crafting strategic guidelines for bilateral / multi-lateral security, economic cooperation, and building bilateral trust.
4.To publish the proceedings of the seminar in the form of a book for wider dissemination to strategic community and academia
Admiral Dr. Jayanath Colombage presented a paper titled, “Mapping the Potential of Blue Economy in the Indo-Pacific Region”.
The ocean is the future of humankind. The humanity will increasingly depend on the ocean resources, not only as a medium of transportation and protein supply, but as an untapped resource pool as well.
The Blue Economy implies sustainable exploitation of living and non-living resources from the ocean. It is a sustainable economic model.
The Ocean has limitations in absorbing heat, pollutants and other hazardous materials, though it is considered as an absorber. There will be effects on marine ecosystems, if the health of oceans declines. The Indian Ocean Region is considered as a rich ocean area for hydrocarbons such as oil and gas, fish and sea grass and sea bed minerals.
However, the general health of the ocean is declining in the Indian Ocean as well. There is even a dead zone of 60000 square kilo meters in the Bay of Bengal.  This is alarming. It has been observed the ocean is heating up 13% faster than early envisaged. When the surface on the ocean is warm and water content of the atmosphere above the ocean is high, it would result in extreme weather conditions such as cyclones, excessive rain and floods.
Main attributors for declining ocean health are human induced pollution and emitting of Carbon Dioxide.
This paper endeavored to understand the potential of living and non-living resources in the Indian Ocean and threats to sustenance of the same. Understanding of potential threats, which can sustain or hamper regeneration of ocean resources, especially from human-induced pollution is important in order to maintain a balanced economic model in the ocean.
Admiral Colombage made following recommendations for effective ocean management in the immediate future with a view to protect the health of oceans for long-term sustainable exploitation;
?  Prevention and significantly reducing all kinds of marine pollution from all platforms at sea and specially from land-based activities including marine debris and nutrient pollution.
?  Sustainably manage and protect marine and coastal ecosystems to avoid significant adverse impacts. Take actions for restoration of the coastal areas and vegetation including mangroves in order to achieve healthy and productive oceans
?  Minimize and address the impact of ocean acidification, including through enhanced scientific cooperation at all levels. Minimize dumping of industrial waste and other form of discharges to the ocean.
?  Effectively regulate harvesting and overfishing, IIU fishing and destructive fishing practices and implement science-based management plans. Restore fish stocks to a level which can produce maximum sustainable yield.
n Ban selling of IUU fishing and compel markets not to sell those IUU products.
n Conservation of at least a certain percentage of coastal and marine areas, consistent with national and international law and based on available scientific information.
n Increase economic benefits to small island developing states and least developed countries from the sustainable use of marine resources, including through sustainable management of fisheries, aquaculture and tourism.
n Increases scientific knowledge, develop research capacity and transfer marine technology, in order to improve ocean and coastal health and to enhance contribution of marine biodiversity to the development of developing countries.
n Enhance the conservation and sustainable use of oceans and their resources by implementing international law as reflected in UNCLOS, which provides legal framework for the conservation and sustainable use of oceans and their resources.
