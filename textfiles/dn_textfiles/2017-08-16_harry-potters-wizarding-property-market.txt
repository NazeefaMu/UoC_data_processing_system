Harry Potter's wizarding property is on the market

If you're a Harry Potter fan, you might like this house. You might like it anyway. It's quite good. De Vere House, which featured in the seventh, penultimate film in the movie adaptations of the famous wizarding saga, is one the market for just under £1 million.
The Grade I listed property appears in Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows part one. It's the birthplace of Harry, and is the place where the young hero's parents were murdered.
We doubt the building, which is situated in the quaint Suffolk village of Lavenham (it poses as the fictional West Country village of Godric's Hollow in the fantasy series), will be short of suitors, despite its price tag. De Vere House will set you back £995,000.
Still, the money gets you 3,165 sq ft, six bedrooms, four bathrooms, and a stable. It's a stark contrast to the Dursley's more modest home in Privet Drive – where Harry lived under the stairs for a time.
According to its previous owners, various shots were taken of the building and its surrounds that were then edited to create Godric’s Hollow. The facade looks as it does in the film, though, so expect fans regularly flocking to your front door to catch a glimpse. Its doorway is the second most photographed one in the UK – pipped to the post only by 10 Downing Street.
The property is currently listed on Rightmove and is being marketed by Carter Jonas. Sky News
