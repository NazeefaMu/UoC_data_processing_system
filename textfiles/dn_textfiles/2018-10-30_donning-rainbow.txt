Donning the rainbow!

The Lotus Make-up India Fashion Week that started with monochromatic designs on the runway, ended with a holistic tribute in the form of a ‘Rainbow’ show on the last day. More than forty designers from across India came together with their interpretations of the historic article 377 judgement by the Supreme Court of India.
Rainbows are reigning supreme in India as the Indian Penal Code recently scrapped Section 377, which criminalises homosexuality.
Since fashion has always been a form of showcasing one’s individuality, more than forty fashion designers from across India came together for the gallant grand finale to showcase the ‘rainbow theme’, at the Lotus Make-up India Fashion Week (LMIFW) S’19, which concluded recently.
It was the first time when so many designers, including Manish Malhotra, had come together to show their respective work, based on one single celebratory theme which was undivided by any gender or sexuality, as transgender models and genderfluid outfits graced the stage, paving a way for a more inclusive society.
With beauty brand Lotus Make-up as the new title sponsor for India Fashion week 2019 (LMIFW), the Fashion Design Council of India (FDCI) organised the four-day event celebrating beauty, glamour and fashion through cultural and socio-economic storylines in their designs. As the show unfolded, it saw several celebrities walk the ramp for their designer friends – from Sonakshi Sinha, Huma Qureshi, Athiya Shetty to Tabu, Bollywood actors enthralled the audience.
