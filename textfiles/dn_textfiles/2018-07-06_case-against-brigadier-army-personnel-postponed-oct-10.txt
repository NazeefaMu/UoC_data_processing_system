Case against Brigadier, army personnel postponed for Oct. 10

The case against an army Brigadier and army personnel for opening fire at a protest requesting for clean drinking water by the people of Rathupaswela in Weliweriya, Gampaha town, was postponed to October 10 by Gampaha Magistrate D. A. Ruwan Pathirana.
Three persons were killed during the demonstration.
CID officers, pursuing the case, informed court that they would require another date to file charges, for although the investigations have been concluded and files sent to the Attorney General’s Department, they are yet to be advised by the Department as to what legal action could be taken.

They were asked to be present in court when the case is taken up for hearing on October 10.
