Paddy predicament

Paddy is the dominant crop cultivated in land coming under the irrigation systems in Sri Lanka. Although profit obtained from paddy farming is relatively low compared to the cultivation of other field crops (OFC), farmers preferred to continue paddy farming for various reasons, such as household food security, lower labour requirement, unsuitable soil condition to cultivate OFC and lower investment requirement. However, farmer should earn sufficient income to contribute to O&M expenses of turn over irrigation systems under the PIM policy.
If the government fertilizer subsidy is withdrawn, the estimated income of farmers per month would be lower than the current estimated level. Farmer families in most of the schemes receive substantial income from upland cultivation, labouring off farm income, self employment and other sources of income from the rest of the household members.
Therefore farmer dependents on paddy farming for their livelihood or other irrigated agriculture need to be increased to make them more committed towards sustainable O&M. Research identifies more constraints in crop diversification as unreliable and inequitable supply of water, lack of organisation or communication between farmers and poor scheduling of water.
Although FOs show relatively higher strength in the irrigation schemes, there are some emerging issues given below which might curtail the FOs strength in the future unless corrective measures are taken (a) low levels financial strength of FOs and high dependence of external resources (b) inadequate financial transparency between FO committee members and general farmers (c) lack of sufficient immediate benefit for most of the farmers other than the status they get in the society, relationship built with government official and training (d) poor communication network may harm the timely passing of information on FO activities and (e) lack of awareness on legal recogniztion given to FOs under Agrarian Development Act.
The major findings of the research study by HARTI reveal that (a) strength of FOs is highest under Bulk Water Allocation (BWA) programme in Mahaweli – H followed by Integrated Management of Agricultural systems (INMAS) schemes. FOs in the Management of Irrigation Schemes (MANIS) shows lower strength. (b) agency support for institutional strengthening is lowest in MANIS schemes mainly due to lack of physical and human resources available in the line agency. (c) impact of PIM on physical condition of infrastructure is ambiguous. (d) PIM policy does not adequately cover O&M part of the irrigation system that is operated by the State. Allocation for O&M by the government is inadequate to perform sufficient maintenance. Unless this situation is reversed and the policy gap is addressed, many systems may call for extensive rehabilitation within a short period of time. (e) In sufficient allocation of resources from the central government has become a disincentive for farmers to do a good maintenance job for the turn over parts of irrigation schemes as proper maintenance of main system also determine the reliable and efficient water delivery in secondary and tertiary canals. (f) PMC lacks power and authority. Therefore the decisions taken at the PMC are some times neglected by the line agencies, participation at the PMC meeting from line agencies is also voluntary and the officers are accountable to the heads of their respective departments but not the PMCs.
One important policy implication of research studies on this subject is the possibility of restructuring existing irrigation pricing system by taking into account the economic value of irrigation water. Such policy reform can encourage farmers to use irrigation resources efficiently by motivating improvement in water management practices and generating revenue for operation, maintenance and capital replacement and irrigation sustainability in the country.
Recommendations
It is very essential to further proceed with the PIM as an aspect of irrigation policy, after correcting the defects in the implementation of the PIM. Because the issues have arisen with regard to its implementation and not solely on the PIM policy itself. Having reviewed various research studies on this subject, the following recommendations are made for the improvement of the PIM.
01. Provision of adequate awareness to farmers and FOs on the transfer agreement, and their roles and responsibilities by the PIM policy.
02. Provision of adequate awareness to relevant line agency officers about their role and responsibilities under the PIM and to accept PIM as their duty.
03. Recognition and service priority should be granted to Farmer Organization (FO) leaders when they deal FO affairs with line agencies and other public departments.
04. Rehabilitation of irrigation systems prior to transfer.
05. Provision of guidance by the government to formulate rules and regulations to establish financial accountability, transparency and training, monitoring and auditing.
06. Provision of an honorarium to FO bearers, specially Jalapalaka for their services to increase their efficiency and to minimize abuse of FO fund.
07. Maintaining a separate O&M fund by FO from the resources collected from farmer contribution.
08. To increase cropping intensity through more efficient water management together with improvements in cropping systems.
09. As irrigation investment in Sri Lanka has not being playing a rationale role on resource optimization, one way to achieve an efficient allocation of water is to price its consumption correctly and reform water management policies to content it. Correct measurement of policy reform can encourage farmers to use irrigation resources efficiently by motivating, improving water management priorities and generating revenue for operation, maintenance and capital replacement.
10. In order to foster co-operation among settlers to ensure water sharing and involvement in maintenance activities, settlers should be chosen from homogeneous backgrounds, with irrigated agricultural experience. They should be selected in concentrated communities and should not be located at too great distance from their irrigated lands. Also they should be settled as early as possible into the project to avoid encroachment and ensure rapid development of homesteads and irrigated allotments. Finally, they should be settled in groups on the basis of a turnout area to facilitate water distribution. In older major settlement schemes where persistent irrigation problems exist, it is necessary to make efforts to rehabilitate physical resources and to re-plan social and institutional environment.

This article is based on the findings of evaluation of various research studies conducted on such topics as Land policy, fragmentation, encroachment on State land, informal land transactions, gender discrimination, irrigation policy and profitability of irrigated paddy sector.
