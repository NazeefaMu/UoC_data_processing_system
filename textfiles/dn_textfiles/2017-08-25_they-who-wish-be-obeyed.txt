They who wish to be obeyed

Collective aspirations of individuals are strong and powerful. They make and break governments. They bring parties and individuals to power and ousted them when their aspirations are not made a reality. The vision of a government should necessarily be based on what people think is right. Moreover, it should definitely meet their overall expectations. Any government or political party can come up with appealing development programmes but nothing will be achieved unless they are implemented.
Transforming the overall ambitions of individuals into the vision of the government can only become a reality if individual parliamentarians execute their respective responsibilities with a strong political will. As a leader, collective aspirations are made a reality through flawless execution as mentioned above. No leader can do a single micro level activity on his/her own. In order to achieve this, they should be able to get things done and make things happen through the cooperation and support of others, be it bureaucratic public sector or private sector. All in all, 99% of any kind of success depends on the flawless execution of plans and activities.
Within the four macro level challenges identified earlier in this article, there are many other challenges that require time and energy, rational and emotional contemplation in order to come up with robust solutions. Certain issues regardless of them being at a macro or a micro level, have been pestering the country for ages. Those affected by these issues say that no one has taken their issues seriously. Those who hold office should be agile in addressing these issues and responsive when the issues are brought to their attention. In order to better manage such issues, every parliamentarian should be objective savvy so that they can quantify the impact and prioritize a course of action accordingly.
Policy decisions
In order to enable growth and achieve the vision of the government, certain policy decisions should be made. This requires changes to the existing regulations and reform in order to meet modern day requirements. Decisiveness in such policy decisions and reforms is a must, in order not to give in to political and social pressures that are coming from multiple parties because what is right is not always popular.
It is easier said than done. Only fruits fall from trees without an effort. Everything else has to be made possible. Leaders should be proactive in looking for the reasons as to why things are not happening the way they are supposed to happen. While the articulation of a vision and its flawless execution are critical, leaders should also be proactive in looking for obstacles that may hinder progress. Be it red tapes, process or policies, if seen as an obstacle it should be proactively eliminated to facilitate execution.
We have learnt that insignificant daily activities can lead to significant outcomes. Therefore relentless focus on achieving respective objectives is key regardless of the changes that may occur.
Politicians are often blamed for being surrounded by the wrong people. These so called ‘wrong’ supporters are supposed to be the wrong crowd to have around due to various reasons. They may be politically misguided due to the fact that they were supporting a different political ideology or regime or they used to criticize the current government when they were supporting the opposition. They may be known for corruption or various other wrong doings in the past.
Even though the prevailing electoral system encourages being surrounded by the wrong crowd, it is detrimental that political leaders surround themselves with the right sort of people who are capable. When you say ‘the right people’ they should be politically accurate, believing in an effective political ideology and should have faith in an effective political vision. Moreover, they should be generally accepted by the majority of the general public.
Just being right does not necessarily mean that they are capable. It is very important that the people who are appointed to hold different leadership positions in public enterprises, different ministries and authorities are capable of executing tasks and getting things done by keeping the overall political vision in mind. It is extremely important to have a group of people who are not only capable of executing plans but who also have faith in the political vision of the government.
If change were an easy thing to achieve, things would have been much easier all over the world. The amount of resistance and political pressure that are coming from different parties would have been minimal if it were the case. It is very much important for a leader to be able to influence the key stakeholders across the society at large.
Be it religious leaders, social leaders, labour unions and various other social groups who have received a sense of acceptance among the general public. Unless properly managed, these stakeholders can sabotage or can cause significant delays for much awaited political efforts to develop the country as a whole. Therefore, it is important to maintain regular briefings and educate them on and about the bigger picture in terms of the overall socio economic impact.
Holding broad support
The ability and the charisma to capture and hold the support of diverse groups both locally and internationally is a key trait that a determined and an effective political leader should possess. However this does not mean using bribes and fake promises to keep a strong hold on his/her supporters and well wishers, nor does this mean giving a packet of rice and a bottle of arrack to get the votes of his/her electorate, rather this simply means the ability to be a leader in the true sense of the word by being fair, honest and transparent as much as possible in his/her dealings and activities.
A political leader who is widely supported and loved is supposed to be street smart and know instinctually to get off his/her high horses and approach the people at a grass root level as well as h/she is supposed to be qualified, intelligent, well versed, and literate in English and all the other main languages used locally in order to gain the respect and support of professionals and intellectuals both at a national and an international level.
In order to unite diverse ideologies, different age groups, diverse ethnic groups and socio economic classes in the country, an effective political leader needs to set an example to the general public by treating everyone equally, enacting policies to reduce ethnic, age and gender discrimination.
This means reducing favouritism and eradicating unfair practices such as giving prominence to his/her close friends, family or supporters. Moreover, a sense of clear direction and a high level of transparency, where all of his/her activities are accounted for and carried out in an open manner, will surely increase the support and respect that such a political leader would receive.
All in all, as a nation we have a long way to go in order to be a proud nation led by effective leaders. Such a day is not far from our future only if our leaders are willing and humble enough to look within themselves, accept their weaknesses and be brave enough to empower themselves by equipping themselves with the missing pieces, qualifications and tools. Only then, would we be able to effectively address the challenges that are facing us and be a proud nation led by great leaders?
