Q. Why are you a chef?
A. Well I think there’s the kind of love that you have in creating something which is also gives a very nice feeling at all times. I like cooking, innovations and following new trends always. Modern cooking inspires me to a great deal.
Q. What do you feel when you cooking, creating and working in the kitchen?
A. Everything based on how much you can imagine, you have to understand what guests need by looking at them. It is not an easy job to do. We are working with many cultures and traditions. It’s a great feeling to serve different people, cultures and many traditions.
Q. Who is your biggest critic?
A. Me. Before presenting a dish to anyone outside one must be satisfied with their own creation. If I’m not happy with what I make no one else would be able to enjoy it.
Once I’m through with it then only I’ll consider letting someone else try. I’m a kind of a perfectionist and prefer everything to be in line with required standards.

Q. How do you handle dishes that are rejected and sent back to the kitchen?
A. I will personally go and talk to the guest and check what went wrong. Then redo the dish according to their wishes - maybe it didn’t go with their pallet because it’s very difficult to satisfy everyone with food.
But having dishes returned back to me is very rare.
Laap Moo (Pork Salad)
Q. When at home…do you cook or do you let your partner take control?
A. I love my mother’s cooking, no one can beat that!
Q. If you were not a chef…what would you be today?
A. Naturalist. Because I love nature especially bird watching.
Q. Of all the places you worked at what are your greatest memories of them?
A. That will be in Laos. I was part of a new hotel opening, so at first I had to learn the language, it was a big challenge for me as there was only just few weeks left.
I had to do everything by myself, I did it very successfully accomplishing the task to the desire of the management and that is a great memory in my life and kind of a milestone.
