FAO to assist in building dialogue on Geographical Indications

The UN Food and Agricultural Organisation will provide technical assistance to the Primary Industries Ministry to fill the knowledge gap and build a dialogue on Geographical Indications (GI) in Sri Lanka.
FAO project coordinator Stephane Passeri met Minister Daya Gamage and Export Agriculture Department officials at the ministry to discuss the assistance.
The dialogue, with private sector stakeholders in agricultural product export and officials, will focus on the potential access of Sri Lankan products to the international with a GI. The partner agencies will review the process of obtaining GI registration/protection and draft roadmap seeking facilitation and resource mobilization for selected Sri Lankan products locally and internationally.
FAO project coordinator Passeri will hold a two day workshop starting on May 24 at the Ministry of Primary Industries.
