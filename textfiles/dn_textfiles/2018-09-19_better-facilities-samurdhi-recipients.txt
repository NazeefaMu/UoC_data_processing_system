Better facilities  for Samurdhi  recipients

The government had recently planned to improve welfare facilities of Samurdhi beneficiaries in Matale.
It had been proposed to set up trade stalls, green parks, and houses under the Diriya Piyasa project. Samurdhi beneficiaries would be educated on novel methods of production and marketting, while counselling would be provided to those who struggle with substance abuse.
The project was set in motion in the Mulatiyana Divisional Secretariat division, recently. The government had provided Rs.2.57 million for the purpose.
