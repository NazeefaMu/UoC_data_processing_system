Extensive talks on Economic and Technology Agreement- PM

Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe yesterday said that he held extensive talks on the proposed Economic and Technology Agreement between Sri Lanka and India on maritime activities in the Indian Ocean, during his four day tour to India.
Prime Minister Wickremesinghe, wrapping up his tour of India, made these observations at a press briefing held at Taj Palace in New Delhi yesterday.
Premier Wickremesinghe pointed out that a decision was taken to base the economic and technology co-operation agreement on the economic relations between the two countries.
“I got the opportunity to meet the Prime Minister, President, Foreign Minister and Indian Congress Prty leader during my visit. Every discussion held with them focused on strengthening relations between Sri Lanka and India. We also discussed about certain projects on which we have agreed upon to be finished by last April. There were certain delays in implementing these projects. We needed some matters out of the way. We focused on these areas,” Prime Minister Wickremesinghe said.
“We also discussed about relations between India and Japan and on the Asia Africa growth corridor,” the Prime Minister added.
“We discussed on the new proposed Economic and Technology Agreement between the two countries and on matters relating to maritime activities of the Indian Ocean. We decided to take the fundamentals of our bilateral economic relations as a framework to design the Economic and Technology Agreement,” Prime Minister Wickremesinghe also said.
