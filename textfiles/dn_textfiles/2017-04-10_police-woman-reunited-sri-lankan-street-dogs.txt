Police woman reunited with Sri Lankan street dogs

A police woman on holiday was so moved by the plight of street dogs that she raised thousands of pounds to bring them home.
PC Claire McNaney, an alcohol harm officer with Durham Constabulary, was enjoying a break from her beat in Sri Lanka last June with her husband James and two friends.
While relaxing on the beach at the resort of Arugam Bay, she stumbled across a street dog who she named Mama with her two puppies.
“They were basically dying there.Their eyes were stuck shut, they were so skinny and malnourished it was horrible to see,” she recalled.
As an animal-lover, Claire couldn’t bear to see the pups left to face a certain death and made it her mission to rescue them.
“I started by stealing sausages from the hotel buffet to feed the dogs.Mama was so hungry she ate six in one go,” she said.
Claire called a vet back in Newcastle who told her what medicines to give to the dog. Then she set about trying to find someone to care for them in Sri Lanka.
“Then I contacted a vet who was around 12 hours away, I couldn’t leave them,” she said.
One had been left badly burned after having boiling water on her and she was given to an animal SOS centre in the island.
She still doesn’t know what happened to the other puppy. After fellow animal lovers raised more than £7,000 for the cause, Claire was able to bring Mama and Angela to a new future in Britain, as well as two other dogs rescued from cruelty by Animal SOS; Seal and Snow White.Mama and Angela are being cared for in the North East, and Claire says she is delighted to see them happy and healthy. One of the other dogs, Snow White, has been kept in quarantine at the Heathrow Airport after he microchip couldn’t be read.
“She is now in quarantine for four months and the bill will be around £2,500. If we can’t find the money, she will be put down which is horrible,” she lamented. - Chronicle Live
