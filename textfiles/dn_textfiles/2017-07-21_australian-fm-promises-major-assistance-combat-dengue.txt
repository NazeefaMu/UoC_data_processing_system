Australian FM promises major assistance to combat dengue

Australian Foreign Affairs Minister Julie Bishop announced a major Australian assistance to combat dengue fever in Sri Lanka.
She made the announcement when she called on President Maithripala Sirisena at the President’s Residence in Colombo yesterday.
Recalling that President Sirisena made a special mention about the spread of dengue and chronic kidney disease in Sri Lanka during his recent state visit to Australia, Bishop said Australia would launch two programmes to assist dengue prevention.
Foreign Minister Bishop said Australia would provide Rs. 58 million for the World Health Organisation to implement immediate dengue prevention, management and eradication programmes in Sri Lanka.
She said Australia will provide additional Rs. 118 million for a research partnership between Australia’s Monash University and Sri Lanka’s Health Ministry to test the introduction of naturally occurring Wolbachia bacteria to eradicate dengue fever from Sri Lanka.
Bishop said the bacteria “prevent transmission of dengue virus among humans”. It has shown success during the last six years in countries such as Brazil, Columbia, Australia, India, Vietnam and Indonesia.
The bacteria have the ability to block other mosquito-borne diseases such as Zika and Chikungunya as well.
President Sirisena expressed his gratitude to the Government of Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull and the people of Australia for providing assistance at a critical time.
He said several agreements and MoUs were reached during his visit to Australia.
The two countries should implement them to ensure benefits to the people, he said.
The Australian Foreign Minister thanked the President, the Government and the Navy for cooperation extended to curb human smuggling.
The President said the two countries should cooperate to curb illegal trafficking of narcotics.
Foreign Minister Ravi Karunanayake, Secretary to the President, Austin Fernando, Foreign Secretary Esala Weerakoon and Australian High Commissioner Bryce Hutchesson were also present.
