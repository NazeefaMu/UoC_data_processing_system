‘Government did its best’ in Meethotamulla incident’

Doing media shows and playing blame games during an incident to achieve petty political targets have now become a tradition; but the government has done its best in the Meethotamulla tragedy, Provincial Councils and Local Government Minister Faiszer Musthapha said.
He was addressing a meeting held recently to review the progress made in providing temporary accommodation for the displaced of the Meethotamulla tragedy.
Each citizen should be thankful to the tri-forces, the Police, and the Sri Lanka Civil Security Force, who are still playing a significant role in assisting the victims,” he said.
“The building used to store paddy was abandoned for a long time. Ven. Vitiyala Kavidhaja Thera and the IGP took steps to use this building to provide temporary accommodation for the displaced. The government is taking necessary steps to provide compensation and shelters for the displaced. Until then, they will be given temporary accommodation with the maximum facilities,” he said.
He said Sri Lankans are very sensitive as a nation in a tragedy and tend to assist without any discrimination.
“In the recent past, some individuals try to accomplish their political needs in such situations. It is not acceptable,” he said.
“I saw people brought bodies of the deceased to the road even after everything was arranged at the Kolonnawa temple. It was clearly a political need,” the Minister said.
