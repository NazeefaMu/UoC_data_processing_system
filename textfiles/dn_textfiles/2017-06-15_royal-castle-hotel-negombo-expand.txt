Royal Castle Hotel Negombo to expand

Royal Castle Hotel, Lewis Place, Negombo is looking to expanding and adding more rooms to their luxury property.
Managing Director Mervyn Fernandopulle said that they are looking at adding 20 more rooms to the hotel to meet growing demand.
He said the hotel which offers 16 rooms with several suites was completely refurbished to higher standards. “The rooms and bathrooms were refurbished and new furniture, linen and a multicoloured LED lighting system too was installed.”
In addition the restaurant was re-laid with an outdoor dining area which is very popular among foreign guests.
“A new pub, 'Spazio', was also introduced with DJ music and is today ranked among the top and most exclusive pubs and bars with fun and music. Spazio could also accommodate special functions such as birthday parties, anniversaries and other functions.”
"One of the biggest draws of the hotel is our rooftop swimming pool which is the only such facility in the region,” he said.
The rooftop grill, restaurant and bar and a smoking room have also added value to the property.
The hotel also offers authentic spa facilities to its guests and complete excursions across Sri Lanka including airport pick up and drop, through Air Wing Tours and Travels.
He said that they are also a popular venue for honeymooners who prefer the hotel's quiet surroundings.
“We have extensively marketed the hotel in almost all the leading travel shows worldwide which has helped to build us a steady client base. Form this base, we have repeaters and other guests who carry the positive messages of the hotel and their ‘happy’ stay.”
