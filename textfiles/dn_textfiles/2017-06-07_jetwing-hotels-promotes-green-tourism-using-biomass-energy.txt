Jetwing Hotels promotes green tourism using biomass energy

In Sri Lanka, the hospitality industry is one of the most fuel-dependent industries, especially for the running of hotels. One of the first hotel chains to use commercially available and modern biomass technology to generate heat and steam is the Jetwing Group, said its Chairman Hiran Cooray.
The use of biomass fuel for energy generation by Jetwing Hotels goes back to 2008 with the installation of a biomass gasifier at Hunas Falls Hotel (back then managed by Jetwing), he said.
“Since then the use of biomass has become quite a standard practice in our hotels wherever possible. The first biomass boiler was installed at Jetwing Blue in 2008 and with its success and financial savings of using biomass over diesel fuel, the technology of biomass boilers was replicated at Jetwing Sea, Jetwing Lighthouse, Jetwing Beach and Jetwing St. Andrew's. All of them were utilised to generate hot water for guest rooms and steam for the hotels’ laundry, if available,” he said.
Later on, steam-driven absorption chillers were introduced instead of electricity-driven conventional chillers. These chillers are powered entirely by steam produced from the biomass boiler. At Jetwing Lagoon, Negombo, electricity consumption of the hotel was reduced by around 50-60% using this terchnology.
Similar systems were installed at Jetwing Yala, Jetwing Lake and most recently a steam-driven absorption chiller was commissioned at Jetwing Blue.
One of the key components of Jetwing Hotels’ sustainability strategy is to manage and reduce energy and carbon footprint. The transition to biomass energy aids in both avoiding emissions from equivalent non-renewable energy sources (diesel or grid electricity) and reducing associated operational costs.
“First and foremost in terms of financial savings we could obtain approximately 40-50% saving from the biomass boiler and 20% saving on boiler plus absorption chiller installations,” Cooray said.
Cinnamon wood, the only fuelwood (biomass) type used at Jetwing Hotels, is considered as a sustainable source of fuelwood, due to its short cropping cycle when compared to other more widely available fuelwood such as rubber and off cuts. Cinnamon is a virtually carbon neutral source of energy and the transition to biomass energy has resulted in avoiding over 2,000 MT CO2 emissions (per annum) from across the hotels.
Cinnamon is not grown as a fuelwood but rather for the production of cinnamon spice and the wood itself is considered a waste or byproduct of the industry. In creating and maintaining a stable supply chain for the purchase of this ‘waste’ product, we have managed to provide the cinnamon farmers with an additional income - passing on part of benefits of our savings to the villager, he said.
Cooray said the mitigation of carbon emissions is quantifiable - the estimated carbon emissions avoided per annum is over 2,000 MT.
The hotels source cinnamon wood from about 30 suppliers who collect the product from different villagers in the region.
He said in this way the communities involved around this project are also benefitted, not just to the farmers but also the local supply chain comprising collectors and distributors.
Cooray said the Ministry of Environment and Sri Lanka Sustainable Energy Authority is in the process of implementing a GEF (Global Environmental Facility) funded project to promote Sustainable Biomass Energy Production and Modern Bio Energy Technologies in Sri Lanka. Jetwing Hotels and other private stakeholders have been invited to participate in project discussions and forums.
The project aims to streamline the island's biomass supply chains, establishing good links between the suppliers and buyers and also to develop centralised biomass collection and storage areas in strategic locations.
“We believe such initiatives would give us the benefit of having a reliable supply of biomass and also help the producers obtain competitive rates for their product, Cooray said.
