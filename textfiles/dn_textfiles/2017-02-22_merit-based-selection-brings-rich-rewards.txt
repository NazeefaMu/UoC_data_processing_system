Merit based selection brings rich rewards

The two T20 internationals that Sri Lanka won against Australia at Victoria that has given them the 3-match series with one match to play amply demonstrates what a difference it makes to a team when “players in form” at any given time are selected. When the selections are done on merit it is the entire country that celebrates as opposed to 4 or 5 people benefiting personally when selections are manipulated.
Manipulation of selections was rampant during the South African series and this was highlighted in these columns especially the middle order batting which was constantly failing and letting the side down. Sri Lanka suffered immensely by it being whitewashed in the Tests (3-0) and the One-Day Internationals (5-0). They saved face by winning the T20I series 2-1.
In the current T20I series in Australia one could see the fortunes of the team with the changes made to the middle order.
Asela Gunaratne has played the role of hero in both Sri Lanka’s victories with some sterling batting performances out of the top drawer.
Gunaratne was not even considered for the Sri Lanka ‘A’ team squad in spite of several consistent performances in the Premier Division over many seasons until he was 29 years old. He was first included as a wild card in the unofficial test squad against the visiting Pakistan ‘A’ team by the selection committee headed by Kapila Wijegunawardene. He thereafter toured New Zealand with the SL ‘A’ side and subsequently was rewarded with a slot in the T20 squad to India for his performances in the domestic Premier T20 tournament where he helped Army Sports Club emerge champions. This was just before the Asia Cup and World T20 and he made his T20I debut in India. Unfortunately for Gunaratne his international appearance coincided with the time that the corrupt administrators were hell bent on scuttling the planning for the World T20 to meet their own agenda's where they refused to send a selector on tour to achieve their own sinister ends.
But as luck would have it Gunaratne got his break with a tour to Zimbabwe where he made his maiden Test hundred. The tour to South Africa followed and in the fifth and final match he scored his maiden ODI century. He has continued this form in Australia with two peach of an innings under pressure that has stamped his ability, class and temperament to bring out his best when the chips are down.
To the present T20 side that has won the series in Australia if one is to add players in the calibre of Kusal Perera, Jeffrey Vandersay, Dushmantha Chameera, Thisara Perera and Kasun Rajitha to make up the ODI and T20 squads what a formidable side Sri Lanka will have. The depth in talent we possess is phenomenal only if they are managed and nurtured by the right administrators.
Sri Lanka may have won the T20I series Down Under under the captaincy of Upul Tharanga but it was blatantly clear that Lasith Malinga was running the show from behind the scene. It was injury that sidelined Malinga from the T20 captaincy and it would be the right decision to bring him back as captain and reduce the workload on Angelo Mathews.
The question that needs to be asked is can Tharanga justify a place in the T20 format? He looked out of his depth while fielding and batting. Just imagine what a formidable opening pair Sri Lanka would have if Kusal Perera replaces him with Niroshan Dickwella.
One also has to question the ‘One captain policy’ advocated by the current administration without any comprehension on how the game has evolved over the years which has placed a greater workload on Angelo Mathews and his deputy Dinesh Chandimal.
Prior to their appointments Mathews not burdened with the T20I captaincy aggregated 1105 runs in Tests and ODIs in 2015. Chandimal slotted in at No 4 in the batting without the burden of keeping wickets and the vice-captaincy in order to give him the freedom to concentrate on his batting and consolidate his position, aggregated 1129 runs in Tests and ODI's the same period.
What we see today is how their individual performances have suffered to the point where Chandimal's place in the side is in jeopardy and Mathews is having a constant run with injuries.
Managing players’ workload carefully is of paramount importance given the busy schedules that they have to contend with in the current cricket calendars. Equally important is of protecting the integrity and independence of the selection process from corrupt administrators.
Sri Lanka needs to address these two key issues if they are move to forward and be a potent force in world cricket which they once were.
