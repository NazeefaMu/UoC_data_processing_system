Port City sponsors book on social etiquette

The Sinhala version of a children’s book based on the analects of renowned Chinese Philosopher Confucius, translated by Ven. Bodagama Chandima Thera, was donated by Port City to be distributed in schools.
Confucius was a scholar, teacher and educator. He was born in China about 2,500 years ago. Confucius deeply influenced Chinese culture, and it extends throughout the world even today. He believed that moral principles, virtues, and discipline should be the first lessons to be taught to a child, and that a child needs to practice them daily.
The outline of the book is based on the teachings of Confucius, compiled and edited over a period of thousands of years.
It explains the standards of living for children that would help them in early development. The book titled, ‘Standards for being a good student and child’ spells out the need to respect parents and teachers, and the importance of inculcating good practices that would make them responsible citizens in the future. Ven. Bodagama Chandima Thera, Chief Prelate of Manelwatta Temple, Professor and Dean of the Nagananda International Buddhist University, translated the book to introduce Confucius’ precepts to Lankan children.
The Thera requested Port City’s assistance in printing the book, for distribution to local schools.
The project company handed over the first set of 2,000 books at a ceremony held at the University premises. Chandima Thera said he studied Chinese culture and traditions over the last 30 years and added that the teachings of the great philosopher would be of benefit to local children.
The Thera thanked the project company for their support in taking this knowledge to Lankan children. He said China Harbour Engineering Company had been encouraging and helpful in completing the Nagananda International Buddhist University building, scheduled to officially open in two years. The university, once completed, would be able to provide boarding facilities to 5,000 international students and 1,000 local students. Currently, it houses 600 students including those from Vietnam, Cambodia and Thailand.
The ceremony to handover the books was attended by Assistant General Manager of Port City Colombo Simon Tham and Head of Public Relations Kassapa Senarath.
