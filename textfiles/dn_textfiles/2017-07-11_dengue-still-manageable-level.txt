Dengue still at manageable level

“The dengue death rate is below 0.3 percent and this is a very satisfactory level. We expect to keep the rate at 0.2. percent.
“We will work hard to lower it as much as possible but passing the ball to each other will not solve the dengue issue in Sri Lanka,” Acting Director General of Health Services Dr. J. M. W.Jayasundara Bandara said.
Addressing a press conference held at the Health Education Bureau in Colombo yesterday, he said that the number of dengue deaths(245) is correct and based on scientific facts but the number of dengue patients(80,732) may not be accurate because it is possible to erroneously identify some as dengue patients.
“No one with fever should apply home remedies and do nothing. He or she should seek immediate medical treatment from a qualified doctor or a hospital,” Dr.Bandara said.
According to Dr. Bandara, most of the dengue deaths occur due to late presentation and most of the dengue patients who died had sought medical treatment after reaching the ‘Leeking Stage’, which is a very serious condition with very low blood pressure level, Dengue Haemorrhagic Fever (DHF), Dengue Shock Syndrome.
“A Moratuwa University student who died from dengue faced the same situation,” he said.
“Pakistan overcame dengue because of the talent of the Pakistan Chief Minister.”
“It is up to each and every Sri Lankan to do their duty in connection with controlling dengue. Driving away mosquitoes is not adequate to stop dengue.”
“Every citizen,no matter whether he/she lives in a palace or a hut should do their duty,” he added.
