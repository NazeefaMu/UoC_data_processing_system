Pushpakumara scalps 13 and helps Lanka s seal dramatic win

Left-arm spinner Malinda Pushpakumara claimed a 13-wicket haul and then hit the winning runs as Sri Lanka A completed a dash to victory in the second unofficial test to win by three wickets and square the unofficial test series with England Lions at the Rangiri Dambulla Stadium yesterday.
England Lions won the first unofficial test at Pallekele Stadium by 195 runs.
Needing 90 to win during the final session, having been defied for much of the day by Liam Livingston's second hundred in the match, Sri Lanka A lost wickets regularly but did enough to hold off the Lions’ unlikely tilt at snatching victory. Udara Jayasundera made 32 off 36 and Dhananjaya de Silva, Sri Lanka A's captain, 23 off 13 to bring the target in sight before Pushpakumara finished the job after a late wobble.
The Lions began the final day still 163 runs in arrears and were grateful for Livingstone's painstaking, unbeaten 140; in all he batted for seven-and-a-half hours in the match, becoming only the second batsman after Kevin Pietersen to score a century in each innings of a first-class match for England Lions (or their predecessors, England A and England B).
Ben Foakes was the only other Lions batsman to pass 20, though, as the Sri Lanka A spinners worked their way through the order. Pushpakumara claimed 5 for 78 to go with his eight-wicket haul in the first innings, finally leaving Livingstone stranded when he bowled Jack Leach for 1 after a dogged 12-over, last-wicket stand.
Tom Curran threatened to spark an upset, taking the first four wickets to fall. Sri Lanka A were 34 for 3 when first-innings centurion Sadeera Samarawickrama was dismissed but Jayasundera and de Silva added 34 in 4.2 overs to regain the momentum.
The stand was broken by Curran and then Sri Lanka A lost three wickets for four runs to Leach and Ollie Rayner to leave them 82 for 7. When Dimuth Karunaratne, batting down at No. 6 after making a career-best 212 at opener in the first innings, was caught behind off Rayner, Foakes had ten victims in the match - including a couple of stumpings off Leach - to set a new Lions record. But with the skies remaining clear, Pushpakumara and Jeffrey Vandersay got Sri Lanka A over the line with five overs to spare.
After the Lions had resumed on 32 for 2, Vandersay made the opening breakthrough by bowling Tom Westley for 12. Keaton Jennings was then stumped off Pushpakumara, giving the left-armer his tenth in the match, but Livingstone and Foakes combined to hold up the home side during a partnership of 107 in 36 overs.
Foakes fell to the final ball before lunch, edging Pushpakumara to slip, and the Curran brothers were both dismissed in single figures with the Lions still in deficit. Livingstone continued to play with authority, however, reaching his fourth first-class hundred off 156 balls, with 11 fours and a six.
In partnership with Toby Roland-Jones, Livingstone eked the Lions into a lead, before Rayner and Leach helped add valuable extra runs but with extra time available to make up for overs lost on days two and three, Sri Lanka A were not to be denied.
Scores:
England Lions 353 and 284 in 92.1 overs (32/2 o/n) (L Livingstone 140 n.o., B Foakes 54, M Pushpakumara 5/78, Dhananjaya de Silva 2/47, J Vandersay 3/102)
Sri Lanka A 548 and 90-7 in 17.4 overs (U Jayasundera 32, Dhananjaya de Silva 23, T Curran 4/38, J Leach 2/3)
Herath to lead; Pushpakumara included in test squad
Veteran left-arm spinner Rangana Herath has been named as captain to lead Sri Lanka in the two-Test series against Bangladesh commencing at Galle on March 7.
Herath led the Sri Lankan team to a 2-0 victory against Zimbabwe in November last year in his first series as captain.
Herath replaces Angelo Mathews as captain for the series. Mathews is fighting to regain fitness following a hamstring injury sustained in South Africa.
Meanwhile, slow left-arm spinner Malinda Pushpakumara who bowled Sri Lanka A to victory against England Lions at Dambulla yesterday with a match haul of 13 wickets has gained selection to the Test squad which is to be announced today after ratification from the Minister of Sports.
Pushpakumara first represented the Sri Lanka A team in 2012 when he faced South Africa and Zimbabwe during a triangular tournament and made an appearance for the Sri Lanka A team in 2015 against Pakistan.
