Along with Faith, Prayer, Obligation to help the needy and Fasting, sacrifice takes an important place in Islam.
Today’s festival stresses the importance of sacrifice which enables communities to understand each other and live in peace and harmony. On this day, my humble appeal to the people of Sri Lanka is to take the spirit of Hajj and to embrace each other and cherish each other’s diversity.
By doing so, let us reflect the true meaning of self-sacrifice towards our fellow citizens.

Hajj rituals fills a Muslim’s heart with in peace and tranquilly. Various rituals of Hajj purify one’s body and soul. Hajj Festival is also an occasion to propagate unity among all, Sri Lankan Ambassador to Palestine M Fawzan Anwer in a Hajj message said. His message adds, “Hajj, one of the five main pillars of Islam, has a message for the benefit and well being of all people, be they Muslim or not. The wonderful message of Hajj is that a Muslim should live in peace with his brothers in humanity, even if they are of different faiths. Though Hajj is obligatory, once in a lifetime on financially and physically capable Muslims, every single Muslim, man or woman, rich or poor, dreams to repeatedly offer it.” “During Hajj rituals, a Muslim respects and accepts the opinion of different juristic schools.
He should never fight or quarrel with anyone, even those who are different from him in stance and conduct. He lives in peace, leaves others to enjoy peace and trains himself to be peaceful and forgiving. Thus, respect, mercy, kindness, and tolerance prevail and dominate the Hajj rituals.
“The celebration of Hajj with a shared spirit of joy should strengthen their commitment to live in harmony with all other communities in the cause of peace, reconciliation and national unity.”/M. Fawzan Answer
