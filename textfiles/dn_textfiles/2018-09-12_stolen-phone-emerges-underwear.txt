Stolen phone emerges from underwear

A stolen mobile phone was found when it unexpectedly rang in the undergarments of the person who had stolen it.
The incident occurred at the Wellawatta beach on Monday. According to the police, a couple who had spent some time in the beach had forgotten their phone when they left. Upon realizing this, they had rushed back and found that the phone had gone missing.
They had later seen a man moving away from the place and the couple had inquired whether he had seen a mobile phone lying on the sand. Although the man denied having seen a phone, it unexpectedly rang from within his undergarments, much to the amusement of the couple.
The man had been compelled to hand the phone over to the couple.
The man was not to be found in the vicinity soon after the incident.
