CIMA Sri Lanka holds first convocation for 2017

CIMA Sri Lanka’s first Convocation for the year celebrated the success of 301 exam completed students, 379 Associate members, 11 Fellow members and 8 prize winners.
Andrew Harding (Chief Executive – Management Accounting) of the Association of International Certified Professional Accountants (the Association) was the chief guest. This is the first Convocation held in Sri Lanka following the creation of the Association earlier in the year.
In January 2017, CIMA and their joint venture partner, the American Institute of CPAs (AICPA), combined their strengths to form the Association, which aims to be the most influential body of professional accountants in the world. The Association represents 650,000 members and students in public and management accounting and advocates for the public interest and business sustainability on current and emerging issues.
In his address to the audience, Andrew elaborated on the significance of the Association further: “Our Association will enhance the recognition of your management accounting qualification, your career prospects and your employability.” The quality of Sri Lankan CIMA members, students and tuition provision was highly praised by Andrew who stated that he continues to be impressed by the achievements of local CGMAs.
He added: “Here in Sri Lanka the CIMA community is a strong one, with around 4,000 members holding the Chartered Global Management Accountant (CGMA) designation.
As CGMAs, they occupy strategic positions in businesses and organisations across different sectors. The community is strong because employers recognise the value that our qualification brings.”
Andrew’s parting message at the Convocation was the importance of management accountants staying relevant in a world facing unprecedented socio-economic and technological changes. Management accountants are crucial at a time such as this to make better business decisions.
The Global Management Accounting Principles of relevance, value, trust and influence were introduced by CIMA and AICPA for quality decision making, to respond appropriately to risks faced by organisations and to create value.
