The varied action sequences will prove to be a treat to the audience.
The trailer of ‘Baaghi 2’ showcased Prateik Babbar in different shades of grey. It is a lesser known fact that the actor has also performed action sequences in the film.
The high-octane chase sequence in Goa between Tiger and Prateik shows them shoot past the streets of Panjim, Dona Paula and Candolim. The actors were made to zip past the streets at nearly 60 miles per hour.
