Shangri-La hotel, Colombo receives global accolade

Every year, editors of Travel + Leisure (T&L), the one-stop resource for sophisticated travellers who crave information about the most exciting destinations in the world, look at thousands of hotel openings and renovations around the globe, with the mission of selecting the most unique game changers.
Whilst a great location, thoughtful design, and intuitive service are expected, what’s harder to define is what T&L describes as the ‘buzz-factor’. Shangri-La Hotel, Colombo sits amongst just 56 properties worldwide on the ‘IT LIST’ and stands out as opening an entirely new dimension to hospitality in Colombo and for Sri Lanka destination as a whole; the hotel being described as “an epitome of the optimism and energy of this island nation”.
With the opening of Shangri-La Hotel, Colombo on 16 November 2017, the hotel brought the brand’s legendary heartfelt hospitality to the city of Colombo. Set in the most prominent address overlooking the landmark Galle Face Green promenade with stunning views of the Indian Ocean, Shangri-La Hotel, Colombo was the most highly anticipated hotel launch in Sri Lanka for nearly 30 years.

He further elaborated that global interest in Sri Lanka has never been higher, with the country recently having been named as Asia’s leading emerging destination for tourism. He added, “In the words of T&L, Sri Lanka has leap-frogged to the top of every travellers bucket list, and for my team and I to be a part of this journey to meet the high expectations of today’s savvy global traveller is truly exciting.”
