Person in yellow robe prevents investigation

A 103-acre forest land belonging to the Weragala Viharaya in Giribawa had been cleared using bulldozers resulting in serious environmental problems in the area, alleged residents of the area in a complaint made to the wildlife conservation officers in the area.
The officers who visited the temple to investigate the matter had to retreat because of the arrogance displayed by a bhikkhu who is alleged to have displayed his person by raising his ‘andane’ undergarment.
