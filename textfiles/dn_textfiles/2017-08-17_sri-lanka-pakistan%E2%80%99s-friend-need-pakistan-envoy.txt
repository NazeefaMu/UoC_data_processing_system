Sri Lanka Pakistan’s friend in need: Pakistan envoy

Sri Lanka is Pakistan’s friend in need, Pakistan acting High Commissioner to Sri Lanka Dr. Sarfraz Ahmed Khan Sipra said.
Dr. Sipra was addressing the launching ceremony of the book, “An Enduring Friendship; Sri Lanka and Pakistan”, organised by the Pakistan High Commission in Colombo to mark the 70th independence anniversary of Pakistan.
He said Pakistan and Sri Lanka have been linked since ancient times, a link which is 2,300 years old. In 1948, shortly after independence of Sri Lanka, the link was revived and reborn when the founding father of Sri Lanka, Prime Minister D.S. Senanayake travelled to Pakistan to meet the founding father of Pakistan, Quaid i Azam Muhammad Ali Jinnah.
The Acting High Commissioner said the bilateral relationship between Pakistan and Sri Lanka has been an important part of the region. It needs to be studied and evaluated. The book narrates the story of the relationship in an elegant manner, he said.
The author of the book, Arshad Cassim said the book narrates the story of a friendship evolving in a non-military context, following the end of the conflict in Sri Lanka. It explores the potential for greater economic and cultural cooperation, he said.
Editor of the book, Dr. SinhaRaja Tammita Delgoda thanked Government of Pakistan, Institute of Strategic Studies Islamabad and the High Commission of Pakistan in Sri Lanka for recognising the value of the initiative. Their interest and support has enabled the project to reach fruition and made the publication possible.
Speaker Karu Jayasooriya who was the Chief Guest at the event said Pakistan and Sri Lanka have a long history of friendly relations. Two countries share commonality of views on a wide range of international and regional issues. Both nations coordinate their positions in multilateral fora and have been helpful to each other during difficult times, he said.
Former Presidents Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga, Mahinda Rajapaksa, International Trade Minister Malik Samarawickrama, Commerce and Industry Minister Rishad Bathiudeen, Primary Industries Minister Daya Gamage, National Integration and Reconciliation State Minister A.H.M. Fowzie, Rehabilitation and Resettlement State Minister M.L.A.M. Hizbullah, Petroleum Resources Development Deputy Minister Anoma Gamage and former Foreign Affairs Minister Prof. G.L. Peiris were guests of honour.
