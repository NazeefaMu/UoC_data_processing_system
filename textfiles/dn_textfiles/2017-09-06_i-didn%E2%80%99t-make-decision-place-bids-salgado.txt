I didn’t make decision to place bids: Salgado

The Presidential Commission of Inquiry Investigating into the Treasury Bond Issue on Monday questioned the Chief Dealer of the Perpetual Treasuries Limited Nuwan Salgado on the February 27, 2015 auction. He was also questioned on the final sales of the bonds purchased at the auction, to the Employee’s Provident Fund.
Salgado told the PCoI that he did not make the decision to place bids worth 15 billion at the auction. According to Salgado, CEO of PTL Kasun Palisena took the decision to place the bid.
“Arjun Aloysius would have been consulted regarding the decision as well,” Salgado said.
Justice P.S. Jayawardena: February 27, 2015 bids opened ways to earn phenomenal earnings, am I correct?
The witness remains silent, followed by a “Come on!” from Additional Solicitor General Yasantha Kodagoda. Witness then replies “Yes.”
ASG Kodagoda: You were the Chief Dealer. Was it you who decided on the bids?
Salgado: It was Kasun Palisena.
ASG Kodagoda: Was it on or not on Arjun Aloysius’s instructions Kasun Palisena placed these bids?
S: Would have.
Salgado became the Chief Dealer of PTL on February 1, 2015. Consequently, Kasun Palisena had become the PTL CEO, meanwhile former CEO of PTL Arjun Aloysius stepped down from his post.
The commission then asked Salgado regarding the way in which PTL business decisions were taken and by whom.
Salgado said the decisions regarding transactions would have come from CEO Kasun Palisena. He said he was not privy to conversations between Arjun Aloysius and Kasun Palisena to confirm that the former gave instructions to the latter.
Justice P.S. Jayawardena: Now, Arjun Aloysius remained in the board of PTL and kept contacting Kasun Palisena on business transaction. So when Palisena was out of the country, who contacted you regarding daily business transactions?
Salgadu: Aloysius.
JJ: So the overall control was with Arjun Aloysius?
It was evident that the witness was rather hesitant to give an answer.
JJ: Who was in the final control of the company?
S: There would have been collective decisions from Kasun Palisena and Arjun Aloysius.
According to Salgado on the same matter, Arjun Aloysius kept his eyes on PTL business frequently.
Justice Jayawardena: Frequently? It should be on a daily basis. It is a lot of money you are talking about.
Salgado: Yes.
JJ: Was not Aloysius the overall chief in charge?
S: yes.
The PCoI also questioned Salgado on PTL’s transactions with the Employee’s Provident Fund.
Salgado said he was not able to close much deals with the EPF and went on to say that he contacted one Udayaseelan of the EPF regarding deals.
The commission asked if Salgado ever contacted Indika Saman Kumara of the EPF. Salgado said he has never contacted Saman Kumara. “It was difficult to reach him. I do not even have Saman Kumara’s mobile number,” he said.
Chairman Justice Chitrasiri: So was it like Kasun Palisena kept you away from dealing with EPF even though you were the Chief Dealer?
Salgado : Kasun Palisena handled EPF more than I did. I have an impression that Kasun Palisena and Saman Kumara knew each other well.
Salgado also disassociated himself from the final sales of the treasury bonds purchased at the 27 February 2015 auction. The final sales have been done mainly and on large volumes with the EPF.
Chairman Chitrasiri : Why do you say you have no responsibility on deals with Saman Kumara and PTL?
Salgado: I can stand by the deals that I have done with the EPF. But not with deals done by someone else.
CC: Why don’t you want to associate with the questioned auction’s final sales to EPF?
Salgado: I can only tell about myself and what deals I made. I cannot tell about deals made by others.
Justice Jayawardena: You know that the largest profit from the bonds purchased at the 27 February auction was realized by selling them to the EPF?
Salgado: Yes.
JJ: All these deals were done by Palisena and Saman Kumara?
S: Yes.
The witness, speaking on the deleted PTL telephone call recordings said he cannot remember either the content or the parties who were involved with these conversations. Even though Chairman K.T. Chitrasiri, Commissioner Jayawardena and ASG Kodagoda questioned the witness more than several times on the matter, the witness stood by his statement that he does not remember much.
However, the witness pointed out he has handed over all telephone call recordings including the ones deleted are now with the PCoI investigators.
Chairman Chitrasiri: Can’t you recall the conversations? Surely you can remember what type of conversations they were! At least one?
Justice Jayawardena: Mr. Salgadu, if you were sitting here, even you would think the same!
