Sri Lanka should not expand use of coal for power generation: Robert Watson

Professor Robert Tony Watson yesterday said that Sri Lanka should not expand the use in coal for power generation anymore, since coal burning impacts immensely on environment pollution on to climatic change. Professor Watson added that there was no need to bend on coal-powered electricity generation, as Sri Lanka is rich in renewable energy resources. “In the power market in the world context, solar and wind powers are crushing fossil energy,” he said, saying that fossil power is replaced by solar and wind power in the present day context. He made these remarks yesterday, while delivering the keynote address at a forum organised by the American Chamber of Commerce under the theme “Climatic Change: Opportunities and Challenges for Business,” at the Gall Face Hotel in Colombo.
Professor Watson is chair of the Intergovernmental Assessment Platform for Biodiversity and Ecosystems Services. Previously he has chaired or co-chaired several international scientific, technical and economic assessments. Professor Watson noted that Sri Lanka is rich in natural and renewable resources, which could be utilised for satisfying the demand for power rather than relying on coal power. Wind power and solar power could easily be utilised for power generation. He added that fossil fuel burning both for power generation and transportation, causes a severe impact on environment pollution. Speaking on the global threats caused by the environment pollution, he said that it had been noticed that there was a rise in global mean sea level. Besides, ocean acidification is also another threat to the entire world.
He said that deforestation would undermine Sri Lanka’s tourism industry. Speaking on carbon dioxide emission, he added that Sri Lankan carbon dioxide emission rate is 0.8 compared with certain countries. He urged that Sri Lanka should have a sustainable development strategy. “Attending on these issues is critically important for Sri Lanka to move forward,” he said.He further said that it is vital to increase energy efficiency methods while bending on utilizing sustainable energy resources. Businesses globally are seeing challenges, but also opportunities in responding to climate change.
Investment in low carbon technology, both energy efficiency and generation, are at an all-time high. Companies may face additional challenges if buyers impose limits on the carbon intensity of products.
Sri Lankan businesses have a significant opportunities to leapfrog to a new energy paradigm to achieve its goals, while mitigating climate change and adapting to the grave risks posed by climate change.
President Maithripala Sirisena was the Chief Guest at the event.
