Japan's Takeda to buy US cancer drug

Japan's Takeda Pharmaceutical said it would buy cancer drug maker Ariad Pharmaceuticals in a deal valued at $5.2 billion, to beef up its oncology pipeline.
Takeda which in September revealed it was scouting for multibillion-dollar acquisitions to reduce its dependence on domestic sales agreed to pay $24 for each Ariad share, a premium of about 75 percent to its Friday close. Ariad stock was up 73 percent at $23.77 in morning trading on Monday. In 2016, its shares had nearly doubled.
Takeda's top-selling blood cancer drug Velcade is expected to face generic competition this year and other key products go off patent from 2020. CNBC News
