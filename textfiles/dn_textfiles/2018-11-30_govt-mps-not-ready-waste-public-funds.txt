Govt MPs not ready to waste public funds

MP Lakshman Yapa Abeywardene said the Government MPs will continue to boycott parliamentary sessions as Speaker Karu Jayasuriya was convening parliament in violation of procedure and wasting public money for a purpose not beneficial to the people.
Abeywardene said the Parliament is being convened without a proper order paper and added the
Government MP’s will continue to boycott parliament until Speaker follows proper procedure.
“If the Speaker follows procedure in preparing the order paper and committee selections, we are prepared to take part in sessions even today” he added.
He stressed that the Government MP’s were not prepared to waste public money if the Speaker convenes parliament in an illegal manner. Abeywardene was addressing a media briefing at the Prime Minister’s office in Colombo yesterday.
He said the Parliament canteen has been informed not to prepare food for government MPs as they are not taking part in sessions. Abeywardene said that at least Rs 500,000 has to be spent daily to hold parliamentary sessions and questioned who would bear the responsibility of money spent for parliament sittings since November 14.
The MP urged the Speaker not to waste public money by convening parliament and added the Speaker should wait until the court delivers its order to convene parliament.
