Petition challenging Geetha's election as MP fixed for Jan.10

The Court of Appeal yesterday fixed for January 10 to file objections regarding a writ petition filed by five residents of the Galle District challenging the constitutionality of electing popular actress Geetha Kumarasinghe as a Member of Parliament, since she holds duel citizenship.
When the petition came up before justice Vijith Malalgoda, the Court ordered the respondents to file objections.
The petitioners had sought an order of writ of Quo Warranto declaring that MP Geethah Kumarasinghe is disqualified to be a Member of Parliament and thus not entitled to hold office as a Member of Parliament.
The petitioners N.W.E. Buwaneka of Beddegama, J.K. Amarawardhana of Yatalamatta, A.C. Gunasekara of Unawatuna, J.K. Wijesinghe of Ambalangoda and H.L. Prasanna Deepthilal of Galle maintained that Mrs. Kumarasinghe is a holder of duel citizenship, namely of Sri Lanka and Switzerland, who had contested the 2015 Parliament Election and had not divulged her duel citizenship at the time of submission nominations.
The petitioners had cited Geetha Samanmali Kumarasinghe, M.N. Ranasinghe Controller General of Immigration and Emigration, Prof. Vishwa Warnapala the secretary of UPFA, Dhammika Dasanayake the secretary general of parliament as respondents.
They stated that by virtue of constitution in particular Section 20 of the 19th Amendment to the Constitution, Article 91(1)(d)(xiii) she is not qualified to be elected as a Member of Parliament. The relevant provision stated that a citizen of Sri Lanka who is also a citizen of any other country shall not be qualified to be elected as a Member of Parliament or to sit and vote in Parliament.
The petitioners stated that due to public interviews of the first respondent published in the media, they were of the reasonable apprehensive that she was a holder of a duel citizenship and that she was a citizen of Switzerland.
