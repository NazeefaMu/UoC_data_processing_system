Gem veins unearthed during stream rehabilitation

A string of potential gem veins unearthed during rehabilitation work on a stream in the low-lying areas of Kirkswall Group, Bogawanthalawa have been vested in the National Gem and Jewellery Authority.
This follows the intervention of Bogawanthalawa Police.
The rehabilitation work had been entrusted to a private firm after calling tenders by the Ambagamuwa Divisional Secretariat following complaints that the stream starts overflowing during rains, flooding estate line rooms.
The gem veins unearthed during excavations done on the banks of the stream using a backhoe machine. The National Gem and Jewellery Authority plans to sell the gem veins after calling tenders.
