JVP questions removal of Asoka Peiris

Industry and Commerce Minister Rishad Bathiudeen yesterday said in Parliament that he would hold a proper inquiry over the charges made against Maithri Gunaratne, the newly appointed Competent Authority of Lanka Mineral Sands Limited.
The minister also distancing himself from the sudden removal of Asoka Peiris as the head of Lanka Mineral Sands Company appreciated his service and commitment to convert the institution to a profitable and successful venture.
“Asoka Peiris was a senior and talented officer in the Sri Lanka Administrative Service (SLAS). He had done no wrong. He was also the Chairman of Delimitation Review Committee and performed his duties well, both positions he held simultaneously,” he commented.
The minister made this comment in response to a question raised by Chief Opposition Whip and JVP Leader Anura Kumara Dissanayake over replacing Asoka Peiris with Maithri Gunaratne at Lanka Mineral Sands Limited. The minister replied that the new appointment had been made by the Secretary to the President and not by him.
MP Dissanayake, while observing that Maithri Gunaratne was removed from the Lanka Coal Company due to his implication in the controversial coal procurement tenders, questioned the rationale behind appointing him to the Lanka Mineral Sands Limited.
“This has given the impression to the people that this Government only wants corrupt officials and that there is no chance for officials with integrity. Maithri Gunaratne recently made a site visit to Pulmudai by helicopter. Such is his wasteful expenses,” Dissanayake alleged.
The minister replying to these concerns said he would get a clarification from Gunaratne in this regard and take necessary action. He also stressed that there is no plan to privatise the Lanka Mineral Sands, but added a private sector investment is being sought to hand over the management of the Company while retaining the ownership to the State.
MP Dissanayake also challenged the Government to point out a single wrong doing by Peiris when executing his duties.
“Asoka Peiris who was appointed to the Lanka Mineral Sands Limited in 2015 worked hard to its betterment until his removal on February 7, 2017. The revenue of the institution which was Rs.285 million in 2015 increased to Rs.1,250 million in
2016. The balance of the company’s bank account which was Rs 61 million in 2015 was Rs.385 million when he handed it over.
The Company’s monthly expenditure which was Rs.100 million has been reduced to Rs 65 million. The bonus of the workers has been increased from Rs.17,000 – Rs 43,000,” Dissanayake explained.
