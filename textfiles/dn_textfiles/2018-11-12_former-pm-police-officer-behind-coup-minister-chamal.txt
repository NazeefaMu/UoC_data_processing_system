Conspiracy to kill President, Former Defence Secretary
Former PM, police officer behind coup - Minister Chamal

Health, Nutrition and Media Minister Chamal Rajapaksa said a conspiracy was made to assassinate President Maithripala Sirisena and former Defence Secretary Gotabaya Rajapaksa and a high ranking police officer and former Prime Minister were allegedly in the coup.
He said the Speaker of Parliament had issued statements regarding the proroguing of Parliament and other matters unconstitutionally.
The Minister said that if the President had acted contrary to the Constitution, any one can seek Supreme Court clarification on the issue.
The previous government safeguarded the honour and integrity of State posts without attempting to cling on to power. When war heroes and priests were jailed without valid reasons, the people urged the President to protect them. He appointed Mahinda Rajapaksa as Prime Minister to save the country, he said.
The Minister said he held the speaker post once but he never acted unconstitutionally but impartially. - RW
