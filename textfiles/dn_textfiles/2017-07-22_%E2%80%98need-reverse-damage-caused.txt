‘Need to reverse damage caused

Minister Daya Gamage, ICAPP Asia-Europe Bureau Vice Chairman:
Primary Industries Minister and United National Party Senior Deputy Chairman Daya Gamage was appointed ICAPP Asia-Europe Bureau Vice Chairman at the International Conference of Asian Political Parties (ICAPP), recently.
The International Conference of Asian Political Parties (ICAPP) was launched in Manila in September 2000 to promote exchanges and cooperation between political parties with various ideologies from different Asian countries.
This is to enhance mutual understanding and trust among Asian countries, and to promote Asia’s regional cooperation through the unique role and channel of political parties. The primary focus of the Regional Leaders was on climate change in the region and how to overcome challenges.
Minister Gamage speaking at the conference said, “A systematic change of behavior is needed. This means immediate investment and worldwide use of renewable energy sources such as solar, hydroelectric and wind power. At the same time, we have to reverse the damage through recycling every gram of plastic and metal used.”
“I must stress that although developed countries may have been the initial contributors to global warming and climate change, as Asia develops, we must not make the same mistakes they did. Instead, we must develop to be more energy-efficient and reduce our impact - especially as Asia is home to almost 2/3 of the world's population. It is critical that we get our house in order before looking over to see what our neighbors are doing,” the minister added.
He said Asia is home to more than half of the world’s population and to most of the world’s production which makes it one of the most dynamic regions in the world, with huge economic potential.
Therefore, national co-existence and collaboration among economic structures, and institutions of Asia and Europe are of utmost importance for moving towards the future.
“Both regions should nurture this relationship towards greater integration,” he said.
