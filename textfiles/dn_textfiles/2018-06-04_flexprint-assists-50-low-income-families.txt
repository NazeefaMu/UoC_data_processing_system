Flexprint assists 50 low-income families

Fifty low-income families in the Ranmuthugala Grama Niladhari division were provided with rations last week, as a part of an annual social welfare endeavour taken up by the Flexiprint printing company. Accordingly, 26 students were provided with schoolbags, shoes and stationery, while 24 families received dry rations.
Flexiprint Managing Director Sathis Abeywickrama, responding to the Daily News, said his company's management succours underprivileged people living outside the factory premises, adding that such a community-based approach would benefit both the company and the community, as they both share the interest of developing the area economically as well as socially.
