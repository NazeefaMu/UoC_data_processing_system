Principal held for molesting student

A school principal who had allegedly molested a schoolgirl was arrested when he surrendered to police through a lawyer, Pitigala Police said.
The schoolgirl who was due to sit the GCE Advanced Level Examination for the second time had received special care and favour from the school principal, investigations revealed. Two sisters of the girl are also attending the same school.
The Principal had visited the girl’s home several times when her father was ill with a heart condition. The Principal had also been constantly in contact with the girl over the telephone. On July 11, the day of the incident, the principal had visited the girl’s house when her parents and other siblings were away. The only occupants had been the girl and her 80-year-old grandfather. An aunt who had visited the house had seen the principal in the house.
Thereafter, the girl’s mother had accompanied the girl to the Pitigala Police Station and lodged a complaint. After police investigated the matter, the principal visited the police station with his lawyer and surrendered to police. The schoolgirl was referred to a JMO for medical examination.
