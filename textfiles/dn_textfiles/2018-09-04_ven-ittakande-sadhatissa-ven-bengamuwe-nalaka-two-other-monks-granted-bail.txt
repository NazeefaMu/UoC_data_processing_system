Causing damage to public property
Ven. Ittakande Sadhatissa, Ven. Bengamuwe Nalaka, two other monks granted bail

Ven. Magalkande Sudatta Thera, Ven. Madille Pannaloka Thera, Ven. Ittakande Saddhatissa Thera and Ven. Bengamuwe Nalaka Thera were released on bail by Fort Magistrate Lanka Jayarathne yesterday.
The Gangodawila Magistrate’s Court on Friday issued arrest warrants on six Theras including Ven. Bengamuwe Nalaka Thera, after Police informed the court that the suspects have been identified in connection with the damages caused to public property during a protest by disabled war veterans in 2016.
The suspects were released on surety of Rs.150, 000 each. President Counsel Tirantha Walaliyadda appeared on behalf of the monks and pleaded his clients be granted bail. The Magistrate fixed the inquiry for December 7 and ordered that a statement be made to the Fort Police.
