UNHRC sessions: US takes note of Sri Lanka

When it comes to human rights no country should be free from scrutiny, but neither should any democratic country be purely be subjected to unfair unbalanced and unfounded bias, US Deputy Assistant Secretary of State Erin Barclay told the UNHRC session yesterday.
Speaking on behalf of the Trump administration, she also took note of the UNHRC action on Sri Lanka stating that, “action by the Council catalyzed progress for reform and provided technical assistance to improve accountability for past violations in Sri Lanka”.
“When the Council functions properly it has the ability to remind of their commitments and obligations. It can hold countries accountable for the same. When the Council works as it should, its successes are victories for human rights” she said.
However, she was critical of the UNHRC over the manner in which it deals with some countries such as Israel.
“We must always bear in mind that Human rights are universal and every state has duty to promote respect and accountability for its universal rights. The US commitment to fundamental human rights is stronger than ever. Regrettably too many of the actions of this council do not support those universal principles. Indeed they contradict them” she said.
“The United States also remains deeply troubled by the Council’s consistently unfair and unbalanced focus on democratic country, Israel. The obsession with Israel is a largest threat to this council’s credibility.
The US is opposed to this.
Not just in Israel, but where ever it occurs” she commented.
“As we consider our future engagements, my government will be considering the Council’s actions with an eye toward reform to more fully achieve the Council’s mission to protect and promote human rights. Building greater credibility of the HRC will increase our ability to help create a better world for individuals in all countries. Together, by turning our attention consistently to the most critical human rights situations, we can make progress and help this body fulfill its mandate to make the world a better, safer place,” she added.
