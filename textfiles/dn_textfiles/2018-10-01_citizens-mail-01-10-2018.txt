Luxury apartment endangers citizens
Colombo has a novel skyline with high rise buildings. An apartment complex is built on the Baseline road by a leading construction company. The extent of land is 11.2 perches. It has seven floors and more than 12 housing units. One boundary is facing the Baseline Road and the side walls are facing the neighbours. The CMC approved plan to the land has the roadway through a side lane.
The contractor has obtained an entrance through the bus bay on the Baseline Road. One of the boundary walls has an opening extending to all floors. This opening on the boundary wall faces the entrance and gardens of two neighbours. Any solids, garbage fallen accidentally or thrown intentionally from such heights could be fatal. It also jeopardizes the privacy of the neighbours. This contradicts with the regulations of UDA, RDA, CMC and NWS& DB.
The RDA has already earmarked to further extend the Base Line Road by another four feet. The pillars and columns of the said construction fall in these lines.
The contractor has already, through the media, sold the property to possible buyers. When asked from the state institutions they said that this building contradicts all regulations. The proprietor of this construction company is a politically connected person.
As for the neighbours, the question arises how did the state officials authorize the construction of such a building? What is the predicament of the unsuspecting buyers? Would the state institutions UDA, RDA, CMC, NW & DB address the grievances of the affected and harassed neighbours?
