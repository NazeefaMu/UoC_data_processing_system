Sandun’s ten helps Richmond to an innings win

A match bag of ten wickets by Sandun Mendis saw Richmond home for tea by an innings and 62 run in their Singer schools under 19 match against St Thomas’ College Matara at Uyanwatta yesterday.
The Thomians electing to bowl first did well to restrict Richmond to a first innings score of 199 but resuming at their overnight score of 40/3 they couldn’t make much headway being dismissed for 67 by Mendis who took 6/13 off 14.1 overs and Dilum Sudeera 3/18 off 18 overs.
Following on the Thomians were spun out for 70 runs by Mendis and Thaveesha Abhishek who captured four wickets each. Scores: Richmond 199;
STC Matara 67 (40/3) in 46.1 overs (Woshitha Amarasinghe 20, Dilum Sudeeera 3/18, Sandun Mendis 6/13) and 70 in 38.4 overs (Tharusha Kavindya 26, Thaveesha Abhishek 4/26, Sandun Mendis 4/21)
