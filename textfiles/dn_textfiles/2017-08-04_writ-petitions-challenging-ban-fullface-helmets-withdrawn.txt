Writ petitions challenging ban of fullface helmets withdrawn

Three writ petitions which had been filed challenging the operation of the police circular banning the use of face-covered helmets were today withdrawn before Court of Appeal by the petitioners.
The petitioners decided to withdraw their petitions following the government's decision to issue new regulations, allowing to use fullface helmets. 
The Court of Appeal two-judge-bench comprising Justice L.T.B. Dehideniya and Justice Shiran Gunaratne allowed the petitioners to withdraw their petitions.
Three writ petitions had been filed by a Chartered Accountant, a Retired Army Major and an attorney-at-law who sought an order prohibiting the authorities from taking any action on banning the use of such helmets.
Petitioner Rtd. Major Nalaka Indrajith, Chanaka Dassanayake and attorney-at-law Edward Ahangama had sought an interim order to suspend the operation of the gazette notification No. 644/20 dated 11/1/1991.
In these petitions, the Police Chief, the Minister of Public Order, the Minister of Internal Transport and the Attorney General were named as respondents. 
Counsel Iresh Seneviratne, Pulasthi Rupasinghe, Thishya Weragoda and Niluka Dissanayake appeared for the petitioners.
