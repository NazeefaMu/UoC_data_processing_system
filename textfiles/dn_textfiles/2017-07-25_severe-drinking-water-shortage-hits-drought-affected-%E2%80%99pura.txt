Severe drinking water shortage hits drought affected A’pura

There has been a large scale scarcity of drinking water in the Anuradhapura district.
People in the Anuradhapura district, especially those in rural areas, are facing a severe shortage of drinking water due to the prolonged drought. Anuradhapura Government Agent R.M. Wanninayake told the Daily News that the distribution of drinking water through bowsers, which was confined to six DS Divisions, have now been extended to 11 DS jurisdictions.
Accordingly, steps have been taken promptly for the distribution of portable water to nearly 15,000 families in Vilachchiya, Nochchiyagama, Thambuttegama, Thalawa, Padaviya, Kahatagasdigiliya, Rambewa, Nachchaduwa, Ipalogama, Galnewa and Thirappane DS divisions. The GA said further that, usually one person gets 5-6 litres of drinking water per day.
It is learnt that arrangements are being made to provide drinking water to every family affected by the water scarcity under the supervision of District Disaster Management Assistant Director Deshapriya Bandara .
In the meantime, considering the supply of drinking water as a matter of emergency, the Government Agent has taken measures to hire a fleet of additional bowsers from the district on payment of an allowance to bowser owners. He made a request from bowser owners to provide their bowsers through the divisional secretaries, treating this as a social service, rather than profit. He further said that already he has requested for 28 bowsers from the Disaster Management Ministry.
