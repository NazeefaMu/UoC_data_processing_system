Government to make Sunday Schools compulsory

The government has decided to make Sunday School education compulsory for all school students countrywide. Accordingly, a Cabinet paper for the said purpose would be tabled soon.
“I wish to discuss this matter in detail with Education Minister Akila Viraj Kariyawasam as to how students could be motivated to attend religious education activities,” Kurunegala District United National Party (UNP) Parliamentarian and Buddhasana Minister Gamini Jayawickrama Perera said.
He was addressing a meeting for journalists which was held at the Bingiriya Devagiri Raj Maha Viharaya in Kurunegala, to discuss matters regarding this year’s Vesak festival that falls on April 29.
“Students who show outstanding results at provincial and national-level Sunday School examinations, would be given preference if or when they transfer to another school, or when seeking government job opportunities. This initiative would help create a disciplined future generation within Sri Lanka. As such, the matter should be discussed with Cabinet ministers of different faiths,” the minister added.
