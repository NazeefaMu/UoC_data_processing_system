Presidential intervention sought to reinstate army unit

SithuIpawwa Rajamaha Viharaya Chief Incumbent Ven. Metaraba Hemaratana Thera has requested President Maithripala Sirisena in writing to reinstate the Katagamuwa army unit that was removed a week ago . The army unit had been a great help to safeguard the Yala National Park for three decades. The presence of the army unit apprehended illicit tree cutters, gem miners, cannabis cultivators and poachers, the Thera stated in his letter to the President.
The Sithulpawwa Raja Maha Viharaya lies in the middle of the Yala National Park. The Thera said he had written to Minister Sajith Premadasa and the Army Commander as well in this regard.
