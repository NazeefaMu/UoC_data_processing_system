A group of housewives were nabbed by police during a raid carried out on an illegal gambling centre at Thalapitiya, Mawanella yesterday.
The housewives are said to have engaged in gambling during daytime after their husbands left home for work. The centre run by a 36-year-old woman was at a house in Thalapitiya.
Police nabbed five women and a man during the raid. The arrested women confessed that they visited the gambling den daily and wagered unknown to their husbands, police said.
