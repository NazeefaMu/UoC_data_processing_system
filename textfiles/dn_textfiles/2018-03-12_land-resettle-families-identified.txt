Lower Malwathu Oya reservoir
Land to resettle families identified

Land to accommodate farmer families displaced by the building of the lower Malwathu Oya reservoir has been identified.
According to the Irrigation Department, 13 ancient tanks will be submerged when the building of the reservoir is completed. The farmer families cultivating under these tanks are being resettled on 947 acres between Kaluwila and Narawila junction and on 1,260 acres in Gatamuna, Nalanda, Randeniya, Handapangoda, Sooriyathanna, Rathgama and Aluthgama, in the south canal bank. The 13 small- and medium-scale tanks that will be submerged by the Malwathu Oya reservoir are Madawachchiya Eliyakudawewa, Eliyamahawewa, Weliwawa, Puliyankulama, Ruwanmaduwa, Upathissagama, Sinnorukandawewa, Diyamathurawa, Kimbulwewa, Moragaswewa, Kukpitiyawa, Sarambakulamawewa and Rassinhawewa tanks.
President Maithripala Sirisena has instructed irrigation authorities to complete the resettlement programme before taking on the reservoir construction work so as to avoid a repetition of the Yan Oya reservoir project's resettlement project.
The water capacity of the proposed lower Malwathu Oya reservoir is 169,440 acre feet, making it the largest water source in the Anuradhapura District. The Yan Oya reservoir in the Horawpothana Wahalkada area, consisting of 149,000 acre feet, would be the second-largest reservoir. At present, out of the existing 13 major reservoirs, the historic Kalawewa Tank, containing 100,000 acre feet is the largest in the district.
Under the proposed reservoir, 2,000 acres in Thanthirimale area will get irrigational water.
The main dam of the reservoir would be 3.6 km long and the height of the dam would be 23 metres. The government will spend Rs. 15,000 million for the completion of the reservoir project. In addition to the reservoir, a new township will be created adjoining Thanthirimale.
