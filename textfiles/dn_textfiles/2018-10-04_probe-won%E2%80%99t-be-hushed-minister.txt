Assassination plot against President
Probe won’t  be hushed up  - Minister

There is no intention to hush up investigations into the assassination plot of President Maithripala Sirisena and former Defence Secretary Gotabaya Rajapaksa, Co-cabinet Spokesman, Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne said yesterday.
He said investigations had revealed that Namal Kumara had met former Defence Secretary Gotabhaya Rajapaksa and former President Mahinda Rajapaksa.
“It is also good for the government to disclose any links between Namal Kumara and the Rajapaksa family,” he added.
He said the CID inquiry will reveal the truth and the government is expecting its final report.
