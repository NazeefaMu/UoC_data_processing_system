‘UNP should be given opportunity to govern country’

The United National Party (UNP), which defeated the No-Confidence Motion by mustering 122 votes against it, should be given an opportunity to govern the country, Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) Treasurer and Parliamentarian S. B. Dissanayake said.
He said the ministerial posts relinquished by SLFP members including him, had been allocated to several others on a temporary basis and that a permanent Cabinet of Ministers would be appointed within the next few days.
Addressing a Jana Hamuwa held at Kiwul Linda, Hewaheta, Dissanayake said a meeting of the SLFP Central Committee would be convened soon, to adopt the proposal to leave the government ranks and that they hoped to occupy opposition benches at the next parliamentary sessions.
Dissanayake said they hoped to build a broad coalition by joining hands with all patriotic sections and progressive parties representing the Joint Opposition and outside it, and seek a mandate from the people.
