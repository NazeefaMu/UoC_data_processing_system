Health Minister solicits help from heads of institutions to control dengue

Health Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne has informed all Cabinet Ministers, Chief Ministers of all Provinces and State Ministers in connection with obtaining their support towards the control of the increasing dengue threat in State institutions, Health Ministry sources said.
According to the sources, Minister Dr. Senaratne had made a written request from the Ministers to implement an inspection programme to detect dengue mosquito breeding sites in their respective institutions on January 24. Dengue mosquito breeding sites located in State institutions have increased alarmingly.
Once respective State institutions ascertain their own dengue mosquito breeding grounds and destroy them on January 24, health authorities attached to the MOH Offices in their relevant areas would inspect the State institutions on January 25, 26 and 27, the sources said.
According to the latest findings of the Health Ministry, 65 percent of all state institutions in the country, 70 percent of all religious institutions, 60 percent of all schools and 58 percent of all construction sites harbour dengue mosquito breeding sites.
A total of 1,311 dengue patients have been reported during the past 17 days of this year. A total of 54,727 dengue patients and 78 deaths were reported last year, the sources added.
