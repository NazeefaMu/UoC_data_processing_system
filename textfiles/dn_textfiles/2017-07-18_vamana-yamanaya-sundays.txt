Vamana Yamanaya on Sundays

Senaka Edirisinghe’s teledrama Vamana Yamaya is telecasting every Sunday at 8.35 pm on Rupavahini. The story rotates on three friends who leave their home town to pursue higher education. They encounter an unexpected situation when they meet a dwarf. Unravelling the mystery of the dwarf becomes their mission.
The teledrama is produced by Suraj Jayawickrama. Jehan Srikantha, Dilini Lakmali, Umayangana Wickramasinghe, Chinthaka Kulathunga, Vishaka Jayaweera and Dimuthu Chinthaka star in this teledrama.
