Antonians come from behind to down Dharmaraja 34-24

Dharmaraja College after leading in the first half fell 11 points short of a win as St. Anthony’s College returned to winning ways grinding their way to a hard-fought 34-24 victory in a Division 1 Segment 1A match played at Nittawela. The Rajans dominated for large periods of the first half and should have won this match, but they made several mistakes.
Dharmaraja’s fine first half display was not respected by the Antonians in the second half in rugby terms anyway. The Katugastota town school showed guts, guile and grace under pressure to secure their victory after being down in the first half. To a man, the Katugastota boys were outstanding and put in a tireless performance from their forwards and backs combing well in the second half. The Antonians showed huge character towards the end of the game making superb last-ditch tackles on the Rajans.
St. Anthony’s scored their 34 points (3 goals, 2 tries, 1 penalty) to 24 (2 goals, 2 tries). At the end of the first half Rajans led 24-17 but in the second they were poor failing to score a single point. The entire team made a mess of the simple win they had on offer after their first half display. The losers spent most of the last period of the game defending.
Dinuk Amarasinghe the Antonian captain scored two tries, Mohamed Makrim, Janindu Himsara and Mohamed Shabir one each, Samuel Maduwatha goaled three tries and put over a penalty. For the Rajans, Shenal Perera the captain, Sulanjan Thilakash, Gihan Malinga and Chamika Perera scored the tries with Gihan Ishara goaling two.
