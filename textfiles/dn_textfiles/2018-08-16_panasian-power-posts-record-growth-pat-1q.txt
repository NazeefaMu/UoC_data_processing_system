Panasian Power posts record  growth in PAT for 1Q

Panasian Power PLC, one of Sri Lanka’s leading green energy solutions providers, posted a consolidated net profit of Rs. 99 million for the quarter ending 30th June 2018.
This represented an remarkable growth of 1380% compared to the same period last year. Revenue also grew during this period by 134% to reach Rs 177.7 million. Operating profit for the quarter increased to Rs 138.7 million from Rs 40.3 million during the same period last year.
These stellar results were attributed to contributions from the Padiyapelella, Manelwala and Rathganga mini hydropower plants, both of which have Standardised Power Purchase Agreements (SPPA) with the Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) to supply all of the energy generated to the national grid. The period under review also saw Panasian Power record its first solar power income. The company was also able to increase margins during the quarter by exercising prudent cost control practices which brought down direct expenses and finance costs. This resulted in direct expenses of Rs 19.5 million compared to Rs 22.9 million during the same period last year and a finance cost of Rs 25.8 million compared to Rs 33.6 million during the same period last year.
Commenting on these strong results Dr Prathap Ramanujam, Chief Executive Officer – Panasian Power, said, “This monumental growth is validation of the steps we took last year to aggressively seek bottom line growth as well as the many processes put in place to reduce overall costs. We fully expect these figures to improve further over time as power generation increases at the plants and with greater contribution coming from our solar power investments. With several solar projects in the pipeline, as part of our continued energy diversification plans, and as we continue to explore new opportunities both here and abroad, we are that much closer to realizing our ultimate goal of securing a clean energy future.”
Speaking about the company’s future Pathmanatha Poddiwala, General Manager and Executive Director – Panasian Power, said, “We have already begun construction on another 900 Kw rooftop solar plant in Kelaniya and a 1 MW ground solar plant is expected to begin construction during the second quarter of this financial year. Furthermore, we have entered into an agreement to build and operate a 2.9 MW rooftop solar plant in the Kurenegala district which is expected to be commissioned during the third quarter of this financial year.”
