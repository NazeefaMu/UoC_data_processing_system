President's SAITM solution should reach Supreme Court - GMOA

Any delay in informing the solution (enrolling all qualified SAITM students in KDU) to the Supreme Court will make the issue more and more complicated and serious. This solution given by the President should be informed to the Supreme Court immediately, the Government Medical Officers' Association (GMOA) Secretary Dr. Haritha Aluthge said.
Addressing a press conference held at the GMOA Head Quarters in Colombo yesterday he said that there are five steps that should be taken by the President in order to make his solution a reality. The first step is issuing the gazette notification on abolishing SAITM. The second step is passing the Minimum Standard of Medical Education drafted by the Sri Lanka Medical Council (SLMC) after gazetting it.
The third step is declaring the list of qualified SAITM students who are eligible to enroll in the Medical Faculty of Kothalawala Defence Academy (KDU). This should be done through a committee appointed by the SLMC and University Grants Commision (UGC).
The fourth step is appointing a technical committee consisting of Deans of State Medical faculties to decide what to do (required studies, training etc.) with qualified SAITM students who enroll in KDU and declare the programme to be implemented for them especially with required time duration, he said.
The solution including the technical facts should be presented to the Supreme Court through the Attorney General. As immediate temporary step, the President should inform his declared solution to the Supreme Court through the Attorney General. The GMOA will present the solution to the Supreme Court as a party of the ongoing Supreme Court case in connection with SAITM, he added.
