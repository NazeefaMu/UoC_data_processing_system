Korean investor to enter  Lankan organic sector

The Chairman of Korean SOiVA Telecom company Kim Sang Young and its director Oh Kwa Chil are visiting Sri Lanka between May 10 and 23 to initiate an investment program intended for sustainable development and job creation in the country.
“These investments are novel and meaningful for Sri Lanka with long term development and innovative management concepts. With our value based management system, each partner would actively get engaged and can work properly for ethical and economic benefits,” Young said.
He made this remarks at a press conference held in Colombo with the participation of rural farming community representatives.
This company will register as KOLANKA GROUP LTD, a joint venture company in Sri Lanka. With their initiation, the company also is seeking long term investments. Ethically sound and socially sustainable business will be the key focus areas of this investment program. Expressing his views Young said his company’s main objective is to make Sri Lanka the best country in the world which produce organic foods for millions of pregnant women and children.
Main interest of the investors is on organic food production which will be headed for local and international export market. Their interest area is working with different farming organizations and societies to create as many jobs as possible in this country.
Main investment sectors include developing Organic value Chains and Organic Agriculture Sector areas.
During their visit, they already agreed to cooperate with organic farmers group in Dambulla region. It will be integrated development of organic farm into multi-faced high value organic center of the region including organic food production, eco-tourism with ayurvedic plants and healing therapies, processing and training of the farmers.
Traders association in Dambula will develop their cooperation with this investment group for improving organic farming trends and farmers nationwide. Post-harvest facilities and transportation system will be major investment target.
Ministry of development strategy and international trade suggested 500 farmers in Kandy area. The Ministry is planning to provide one acre land among 500 farmers within a period of one month. This farming group would be a good cooperation model for the investor to develop organic farming areas. This investment program has shown its strong interest to develop 100% purely organic sanitary pad for women and which will be distributed to pregnant women in China and Korea. This will help regrow the traditional handloom industry in the village.
