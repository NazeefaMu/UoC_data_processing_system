SASG Dappula, ASG Kodagoda  not sidelined - Minister

Skills Development and Vocational Training Minister Chandima Weerakkody said there is no truth in the allegations that Senior Additional Solicitor General Dappula de Livera and Additional Solicitor General Yasantha Kodagoda who investigated the Central Bank bond issue have been sidelined from initiating legal action based on recommendations by the Presidential Commission.
He said that they have not been removed from the proceedings and legal action will be taken by the Attorney General on the direction and supervision of both these officials.
According to the general practice in the AG's Department, the initial indictment is filed by the junior state counsel attached to the AG's Department.
Then it goes to the top level through the supervision of the team appointed to probe into the matter.
Addressing a media briefing held in SLFP Headquarters yesterday, the Minister said Additional Solicitor General Murdu Fernando, who is attached to the Civil Division, has been assigned to carry out civil investigations while the team led by Deputy Solicitor General Haripriya Jayasundara will be in charge of the criminal investigations.
He said that all final findings will be forwarded to the AG, through Senior Additional Solicitor General Dappula de Livera and Additional Solicitor General Yasantha Kodagoda.
