DCS launches ‘Lanka Stat’

The Department of Census and Statistic (DCS) launches its first mobile data dissemination App named “Lanka Stat” on 26 April, 2017, the Director General of Census and Statistics, Dr. Amara Satharasinghe said.
The “Lanka Stat” mobile application, in the first stage, works of Android operating system (OS) based smart phones including Table PCs.
The main objective of this development is to enhance the the timelines and efficiency of data dissemination by sending demographic and socio economic indices related by the department directly to mobile phones of the data users.
The “Lanka Start” Android App could be obtained and get installed on an Android OS based smart pone after searching for the text “Lanka Stat” in Google Play Store. Lanka Stat installed smart phones display a message soon after the update or release of a statistic is made by the department and the data uses are given an opportunity to get an early and continuous update to be informed about the release of statistics of the DCS.
The department gives priority to use the Information and Communication Technology Tools to disseminate statistical information to data users in a timely manner to further facilitate and promote evidence based decision making.
The department also launched a sub website named “Lanka Stat Map” as the newest member to its sub web family on 26 April, 2017. This state of the art sub website could he successes with any PC or a smart phone using the official web address “map statistics.gov.lk” or through the link provided to it on home page of DCS main website www.statistics.gov.lk.
The “LankaStatMap” site is able of display the spatial differences of the statistics disseminated by the DCS for Administrative units (Province, District, Divisional Secretariat and Grama Niladhari division) in many different views using geographical maps.
The main advantage the data uses get when using the Lanka Stat Map website is being able to analyse the DCS statistics comparatively with the geographical information available in different types of Satellite images and Road maps, on which the LankaStatMap sub web site interactively displays the regional statistics.
As a first step, the information collected in Sri Lanka Census of Population and Housing-2012 are included in the Lanka StatMap sub website and the data is disseminated at all the administrative levies from Province down to the Grama Niladhari Division level, which is smallest administrative level of the country.
By selecting an administrative area, all the data related to the selected area could be displayed and analysed as above.
The department expects that the development of LankaStatMap sub website would be an important turning point in the way of providing data to meet development targets of the country as dissemination of statistics related to an administrative unit with all the available geographical information of it gives more power to decision makes and brings more benefits which was a long felt need of the country.
