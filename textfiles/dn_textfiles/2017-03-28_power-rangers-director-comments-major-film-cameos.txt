Power Rangers director comments on major film cameos

While the Power Rangers live-action reboot is reimagining the series for a new generation, it doesn’t leave longtime fans in a lurch either. Iconic items like the Power Coins, the Zords, Alpha 5 and Zordon are along for the ride, including two fan-favorites from the original Power Rangers series.
Spoilers ahead for Power Rangers, so if you don’t want to know you might want to head to our Power Rangers hub for more news. The film is currently enjoying an out of 5 rating on ComicBook.com’s anticipation rankings.
CinemaBlend’s Conner Schwerdtfeger recently screen the film and noticed two familiar faces within Angel Grove’s city limits. Those would be actors Amy Jo Johnson and Jason David Frank. Johnson of course played Kimberly the Pink Ranger while Frank played Tommy the Green Ranger. The two were always a fan favorite couple in the original series, and Power Rangers director Dean Israelite recently commented on their appearance in the film.
“Yeah, you saw them. ... Those were really the two that we thought were important to put in there and you know obviously we’re teasing something at the end that relates to [Tommy] so it sort of all felt organic.”
That tease happens in the mid-credits scene, but it only pertains to the character of Tommy, not Frank in particular. Naomi Scott is now in the role of the Pink Ranger, and the franchise will cast someone else to be in the Tommy role. Still, it’s a delightful passing of the baton while still embracing part of what made the series great.
“Saban’s Power Rangers follows five ordinary high school kids who must become something extraordinary when they learn that their small town of Angel Grove – and the world – is on the verge of being obliterated by an alien threat. Chosen by destiny, our heroes quickly discover that they are the only ones who can save the planet. But to do so they will have to overcome their real-life issues and band together as the Power Rangers before it is too late.”
Power Rangers stars Bryan Cranston (Zordon), Elizabeth Banks (Rita Repulsa), Naomi Scott (Kimberly/Pink Ranger), David Denman (Sam Scott), Becky G. (Trini/Yellow Ranger), Sarah Grey (Amanda), RJ Cyler (Billy Cranston/Blue Ranger), Emily Maddison (Rebecca), Ludi Lin (Zack Taylor/Black Ranger), and Dacre Montgomery (Jason Lee Scott/Red Ranger).
