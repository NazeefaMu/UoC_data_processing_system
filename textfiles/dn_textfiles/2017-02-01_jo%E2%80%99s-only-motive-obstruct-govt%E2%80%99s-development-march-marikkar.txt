JO’s only motive is to obstruct govt’s development march: Marikkar

The motive of the Joint Opposition (JO), which has no work, is to obstruct the forward march of the country, Colombo district UNP Parliamentarian S.M.Marikkar said.
He added that the Hambantota Industrial Zone will receive foreign investments amounting over Rs. 750 billion within a few months.
The MP said with these investments, the entire country will benefit with thousands getting jobs. The Hambantota harbour and airport cannot be developed as there is no production from the area. But once the industrial zone commences, the entire area including the port and the airport will benefit, he said. Speaking on the protest by the JO against the commencement of the industrial park at the Hambantota port area, he said the protest was launched by the JO with hired persons from various parts of the country. The participation of the Hambantota people at the protest was minimum, Marikkar said.
The JO does not want the people of Hambantota to enjoy benefits. Therefore, they are always trying to block the country’s forward march, he said. Parliamentarian Thushara Indunil said state officers should also think of the burning issues of the people.
Speaking on the recent issue relating to Minister Ranjan Ramanayaka and an AGA, he said Ramanayaka did not intend to hit the officer but was against persons who ruin the environment.
“We had a history during the last regime where state officers were physically punished. A politician forced a female teacher to kneel down in her school. A High Commissioner in UK was slapped by a politician of the then government,” he said.
“The Deraniyagala AGA was assaulted by the then Deraniyagala Pradeshiya Shaba chairman as the AGA refused to offer a permit to transport timber for the chairman. This is how the then political leadership and henchmen behaved,” he said.
