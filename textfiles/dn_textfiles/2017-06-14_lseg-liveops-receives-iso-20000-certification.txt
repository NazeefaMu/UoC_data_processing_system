LSEG LiveOps receives ISO 20000 certification

LSEG LiveOps, the specialised team within London Stock Exchange Group’s (LSEG) recently established Shared Service Centre (BSL, Sri Lanka) was recently awarded the ISO 20000 certification in recognition of its IT Service Management Excellence.
The LSEG LiveOps team are global experts in providing live operational support for business critical applications used in exchanges around the globe, including supporting software developed by LSEG’s MillenniumIT and its underlying Infrastructure.
Attaining the ISO 20000 certification required a significant effort by the LiveOps team in a relatively short time span to ensure that all of LiveOps’ support processes were re-engineered to comply with recommended standards and industry best practices.
The ISO 20000 certification positions LSEG LiveOps at a tremendous advantage over its competition in the global Capital Markets Support Services space.
Murali Subrahmanyam, Managing Director, LSEG Sri Lanka, said “We are extremely happy to have achieved this prestigious certification. It is a true testament to our commitment to quality and excellence in service delivery, as well as to the talent and expertise of the LiveOps team.”
The certification has aligned the division’s processes to better service its clientele and has resulted in stronger internal business processes and improved responsiveness to customers.
It was developed to mirror the best practices described within the ITIL (Information Technology Infrastructure library) framework.
The certification was achieved through the commitment and dedication of the LiveOps team under the guidance of its consulting partner KPMG and certifying body APMG.
LSEG LiveOps has Capital Market specific experience in implementing and managing business critical IT operations of some of the world’s leading exchanges. LiveOps provide complete Managed Service Solutions and Capital Markets specific Engineering Services. Their clients include London Stock Exchange Group as well as leading Capital Market clients based in North America, Latin America, Europe and Asia.
