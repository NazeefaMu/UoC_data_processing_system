Indratissa raises issue over validity of evidence

Arjun Aloysius' lawyer President’s Counsel Kalinga Indratissa yesterday suggested that the evidence collected by the Treasury Bond Commission from April 27 to July 27, 2017 was done with no proper authority.
Indratissa PC made these observations at the Presidential Commission of Inquiry investigating into the Treasury bond issue yesterday (28).
His suggestion was based on the position that President Maithripala Sirisena did not issue a gazette when extending the term of the PCoI on April 27, 2017. He pointed out that there was only a letter issued by the President to extend the Treasury Bond Commission’s term on April 27,2017.
Accordingly, Indratissa PC said the evidence collected by the Commission during the said time period could be invalid.
Senior Deputy Solicitor General Dappula de Livera said there is sufficient compliance of Section 4 of the PCoI Act for the President to extend the term of a Commission of Inquiry.
Additional Solicitor General Yasantha Kodagoda said it is not mandatory for the President to issue a gazette when extending the term of a Commission of Inquiry Act.
According to the Commission of Inquiry Act, the President warranted to extend the time period within which a CoI needs to submit a report on the inquired matter, despite the time for the submission of such report has expired or not.
