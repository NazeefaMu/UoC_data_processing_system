People’s representatives should set an example: President

President Maithripala Sirisena said people’s representatives should set an example to the public through their conduct in order to create a high standard and valued political culture.
The President made these remarks during a meeting with the candidates who won the recently concluded Local Government elections representing the SLFP and UPFA, at the President’s House in Colombo, on Sunday.
President Sirisena further said that people’s representatives should provide their contribution to solving issues of the people in accordance to a timetable, without engaging in clashes with the public, while acting in an honest and patient manner.
The President explained the need to fulfill responsibilities, free the country from fraud and corruption while listening to the people’s voice in achieving common development goals.
President Sirisena said he believes that without being discouraged by the results of the Local Government election, the representatives will contribute their support to the party to continue with strength and take forward the development programmes.
He asked members to participate in council meetings as much as possible and to dedicate towards the public service through a proper value system.
President Sirisena instructed the public representatives to take an interest in gaining new knowledge through reading so that a better political future can be attained.
He also ensured that after a proper evaluation of the progress of the regional development projects, he is ready to increase aid if needed.
On the occasion, the members took the oath of the party.
