Remembering Venerable Sobitha Thera:
TIRELESS CAMPAIGNER FOR JUSTICE AND FAIR PLAY

The late Ven. Maduluwawe Sobitha Thera did not expect any personal benefits or privileges when he launched the movement for a fair and just society. He had no regrets for spearheading the campaign to defeat Mahinda Rajapaksa at the 2015 presidential election. His sole objective was to bring about a government dedicated towards the creation of a just society.
The people who joined hands with him in his crusade have no regrets either. Although the present government is facing serious criticism, the law abiding citizens of this country never aspire to bring back a Rajapaksa regime to power. Had Rajapaksa been re-elected to power in 2015 the fate that would have befallen on those who tried to defeat him needed no explanation. But today those who tried to defeat the Common Candidate at the presidential election seemed to be the victors and the hopes of the 6.2 million people who ensured his victory are being dimmed in an unkind manner.
This is stated by Prof Sarath Wijesooriya in a book published to mark the second death anniversary of the Ven. Sobitha Thera recently. Wijesooriya states that Ven. Sobitha Thera had to face insult and disgrace both during the Presidential election and after the victory of the Common Candidate. But he always dismissed such abuse and flak as minute when compared to the enormous flak and abuse faced by the Buddha himself.
The government formed after the January 8 victory appointed a council headed by the President and Prime Minister and known as the National Executive Council to fulfil the pledges held out to the people.
Democratic governance
Today certain Bhikkhus who were trying to spread hate by talking about the country, nation and religion in an incensed manner on the topic of a new constitution were only insulting Buddhism. Instead of taking Ven Sobitha Thera as an example and contributing towards the welfare of the country, certain young Bhikkhus were trying to spell disaster to the country by spreading communalism compared to them the manner in which Ven. Sobitha Thera reflected on him during the last stages of his life was excellent. The 10 point plan he submitted after the Presidential election was a clear indication of this.
The 10-point plan evinced a basis with a deep vision to rekindle people’s minds towards democratic governance, supremacy of the law, communal and religious harmony, strengthening the local economy, development of infrastructure facilities including education and health, stabilising human rights and freedom, protection of women and children, environmental conservations and a disciplined and law abiding society.
Any one reading Ven. Sobitha Thera's 10-point plan with patience will realise that his only expectation was to create a disciplined country upholding humanism and ensuring social justice. It was true that bringing about these reforms were no easy task emergence of narrow political agendas of political parties including the two main parties involved in a power struggle had diminished the hopes of the public.
Ven. Sobitha Thera said that we should govern the country through a parliament comprising disciplined people's representatives. Drug addicts, gamblers, womanizers, child abusers and people misappropriating state assets should not be given nominations by all parties at future elections. All parties signed the March 12 declaration regarding nominations submitted by PAFFREL. But it should be passed as an act of parliament to give it teeth as mentioned by the Elections Commissioner. Ven. Sobitha Thera also emphasised that an environment should be created for government servants and trained Foreign Service personnel to carry out their duties without political interference. One reason for the unpopularity of the government was that certain officials who dreamt of a Rajapaksa regime once again were still holding high positions in government. Ven. Sobitha Thera who spoke with agitation about the damage caused to the Judiciary during the previous regime campaigned for the restoration of the independence of the Judiciary.
Judicial reforms were quintessential to realise the goals the people expected from the Yahapalana government. A three-member or five-member commission should be appointed by Parliament to recommend necessary reforms to ensure an independent Judiciary, Wijesooriya says. It was mostly the naked communalists who branded members of NGOs as ‘betrayers of the nation’ and ‘Western Conspirators'. It was wrong to band all NGOs together in making this allegation when NGOs opposed the killing of innocent citizens and misappropriation of state assets and public finds it was stupid to condemn them as those raising their voice for dollars incensed by communalism. Today struggle of the civil society is to retrieve the political culture which was distorted by the Rajapaksa regime restored. Criminals and corrupt people should not be given any protection.
New constitution
The discussion about the need to adopt a new constitution and take steps towards the future welfare of the country had been going on for the last three decades or more. It was not only the Common Candidate who mooted the need to abolish the executive presidency, reform the system of election, devolve power and establish harmony during the 2015 presidential election. Former President Rajapaksa too pledged this in his election manifesto the fact that 6.2 million people had given a mandate for a new constitution had to be accepted by everyone without question. It was well known that the government had laid the foundation for a new constitution by now.
Communal polities gaining ground should not be allowed to prevent a bold step towards the introduction of political reforms. If the government was able to usher in peace, unity and harmony for all citizens the hackneyed word minorities would get excluded from the vocabulary.
The dedication made by the Tamil speaking community towards a political solution should not be underestimated. Opposition Leader R. Sambandan had clearly stated that he expected a political solution with the agreement of this Sinhala community and that he opposed a division of the country. A campaign should be launched to educate the people about the need for political reforms and thwart attempts made to corrupt people’s minds to look at Sambandan, President, Prime Minister and Speaker with suspicion.
The two main parties should grab this golden opportunity which has arrived to adopt a new constitution without allowing it to be lost due to a power struggle. The accomplishment of this task would be a best tribute which could be paid to the late Ven. Maduluwawe Sobitha Thera says Sarath Wijesooriya.
