SPC-MD challenge JO to prove allegations

 State Pharmaceuticals Corporation (SPC) Managing Director (MD) Dr. Rumie Mohamed said he had requested the CID, FCID etc to conduct immediate investigations on the accusations made by the Joint Opposition MPs against him. "I have instructed my lawyers to take legal action against the persons who assassinated my character and insulted me," he said.
Addressing a press conference held at the Health Ministry Auditorium in Colombo yesterday, he said he was a businessman and a strong supporter of Health Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne.
"I became friends with him in November 2014 and supported him from the bottom of my heart as an individual who was victimized by the previous regime. I used my own vehicle for the election campaign of Minister Senaratne and he offered me the position of SPC MD in January 2015," he said.
"I was with Dr. Senaratne while he was receiving treatment in Singapore. I have developed the SPC to a higher level since I took over and ensured equal treatment to all employees," he said.
According to Dr. Mohamed, non of his family members or close relations are connected to the drug companies. "I have my own tea export company, computer company and a press.
I challenge the Joint opposition MPs to prove if any of my relations are connected to a drug company. All Mohameds' in the country are not my relations," he said.
"The drug company owner who slings mud at me is now trying to approach Minister Senaratne through me, but I prevented it. He tried to offer Rs. 5 million to the minister through me but I did not do it.
Minister Senaratne has never interferred with tender procedures. All including Government politicians attack Senaratne now because of his popularity," he added.
