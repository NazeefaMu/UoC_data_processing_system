Special operations under way to nab drug dealers

Sixty police officers with police dogs had been deployed to apprehend schoolchildren in Kurunegala who attend tuition classes while possessing drugs, recently.
About 4,000 students were examined during the past two days and around 56 drug dealers selling narcotics to students were arrested during past two weeks.
These special operations to nab drug addicts and drug dealers are being conducted by Kurunegala Police OIC IP H.M.C.P. Herath, under the guidance of Kurunegala District DIG Kithsiri Jayalath.
During the past six months, about 48 students who were accused of drug-related offences were arrested by police in Kurunegala, a senior police officer told the Daily News, yesterday.
