BASL to take up Kannan’s appointment at next General Meeting

The controversy surrounding the appointment of R.Kannan to the High Court is to be taken up at the next General Meeting of the of the Bar Association of Sri Lanka (BASL) on April 1,BASL President U.R.De Silva.
This would be the first General meeting the new BASL President would chair since taking over office earlier this month. De Silva has also asked for an appointment with the Judicial Services Commission (JSC) to discuss any grievances they might have, “I am expecting a reply from the JSC and thereafter I will go with executive committee to meet them. Then we have to put forward our suggestions,”he said.
The BASL President added that the BASL would take a stance on Kannan after the General Meeting and having been made aware of the concerns of the JSC.
The appointment of Kannan to the High Court caused a stir within judicial circles when the Judicial Services Commission (JSC) opposed the appointment by President Maithripala Sirisena. The President in turn stated that the appointment was based on the recommendation made by the BASL. Since then however, the BASL has denied making such a recommendation,
“We have categorically denied that we have made any recommendations with regard to R.Kannan. There has been a misunderstanding as it was only the President of the Association (Geoffrey Alagaratnam) on his own and not by the decision of the Executive Committee or Bar Council,sent some letters to the President. When it was brought to the notice of the Bar Council, he admitted that he never got permission from the Bar Council to send such a letter using the Council’s letter head,”explained De Silva.
“We informed the Judges Association that we never made any recommendations to the President with regard to Kannan’s matter.The Judicial Services Association having considered our letter have informed the JSC that this what the BASL said and that there was no recommendation made by the BASL. The JSC in turn informed the President that the BASL has nothing to do with appointment,”he added.
The new BASL President also stated that he would inform the JSC of their stance once a decision has been made on the appointment at the upcoming General Meeting.
