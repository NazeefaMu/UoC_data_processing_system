Extracts  from the dentally retarded

One thing that used to terrify me was a date with a dentist. And that dear reader is the ‘tooth’, the whole ‘tooth’ and nothing but...as they say on Hultsdorp Hill. So, what’s the big deal about it when there are millions of others who are afflicted with the same dread.
Fear of going to the dentist is relatively common. For some, it may just cause mild anxiety, for others, it is a phobia and can result in going years without dental care. This may be difficult for some to understand, but if you suffer from dental fear, you know how difficult it can be.
Does anyone know the six most frightening words in the world that send me into a nappy-wetting funk? You don’t! Let me tell you then that they are: “The dentist will see you now.” As Lucky my old friend, now a professor of dentistry jokes that the dental vocation is the most suitable male profession. His contention is that a dentist is the only man who can tell a woman when to open and when to shut her mouth, and get away with it.
Now my buddy Lucky is an incorrigible punster. He loves pulling your leg as much as he does pulling out bad teeth. He has an affinity to pun on any and everything. Nothing, categorically nothing, could lessen his mania when it came to punning. For instance his favourite wisecrack to all ‘denta-mentally’ scaredy-cats was: “Going to the dentist can be very full-filling!”
He also cracked that that well-to-do clients who get gold fillings are those who put their money where their mouth is. It is usually done, he informed me after a cavity search. And similar to the cry that precipitated the California gold rush the dentist can honestly tell his patient: “Thar’s gold in them there fills!”
Old Heck Jaya, a former Radio Ceylon announcer was also a playwright, who had perfect teeth. Yes they really were white beauties with no cavities. He took great care of them, always kept them by his bedside in a glass of water. The first time I saw them come out of his mouth, was when he was in bed in hospital. In the middle of talking about some part of the play he unexpectedly reached into his mouth and pulled out his entire set of uppers and lowers. Splash, into the glass of water they went, and suddenly my stomach turned.
I avoided his birthday dinner parties after one of my fellow actors whispered a tale about his harrowing experience at Heck’s dining table. He said when Heck was once eating his birthday brisket, he complained that his dentures were hurting so much that he removed them and held them in his hand.
He manually chewed the rubbery meat until it was ground down sufficiently to swallow. The thespian continued his monologue saying that he would take the ‘chewed’ meat, dip it into a mustard sauce, put it into his mouth and swallow it with great satisfaction. He would then say something inaudible through his toothless gums and his wife would reply: “Don’t talk with your hand full!”
Now, I have been treated by several dentists both here and in several parts of the Asian region where I worked in for more than two decades. A few who come to mind because of the perfect mating of their names and occupation, are, Dr. Pullman in Kuala Lumpur, Dr. Fang in Singapore and Dr. Payne in Hong Kong.
I’ve never liked going to the dentist and it really took a lot to get me to go. I guess you could say that getting me to go to the dentist was like pulling teeth. You see, I have been to the dentist before so I know the drill. One dentist explained to me that he had quite a few meditation gurus as patients. He said the yogi-types always seemed to refuse pain-killers during root canal surgery because, they prefer to practice transcend-dental medication.
If the tooth be told, it had been 10 years since I have been to the dentist. It was definitely a bad tooth decade. The last time I went to a tooth clinic in Colombo, I didn’t even see my usual dentist. I had a cavity fixed by his son who was just filling in I suppose. I don’t even think he had a degree.
Anyway, I went inside the clinic and sat in his chair. My regular dentist’s name was Dr. Philip Kaviratnage who I had nicknamed Dr. Fill Cavityge. As I eased myself into the chair I began guffawing because I thrust the stand-in son with the moniker Cavityge-ge-Putha.
He said he was in a hurry and needed to leave the orifice, sorry office, by ‘tooth-hurty.’ This didn’t set well with me, but I leaned back and let him look down into my mouth. It was then I noticed how moody he appeared. He really looked down in the mouth. But don’t all dentists do the same on a regular basis. I decided to be nice to him because, after all, dentists have ‘fillings’ too.
They always tell you, “This won’t hurt.” Sometimes they’re telling the ‘tooth’, sometimes they’re not. It’s usually a 50/50 gamble between searing pain and a mild jerking feeling. But just in general, I don’t like pain or inconvenience.
There are several strategies for dealing with this dental fear. The most important, of course, is finding a dentist who is experienced in dealing with fearful patients. A good dentist can make all the difference in the world. Not all dentists have this skill, and in fact, for some people their dental fear began with a negative experience with an unfriendly or rough dentist.
Recently, after almost a decade, I hit on a dental professional named Rozana, who I call the ‘Queen of Dentists,’ not only because she specialises in crowns and other dentistry procedures with admirable finesse, but knows and understands dental anxiety. Dr. Rozana is very careful to listen and respond in a caring and compassionate way.
Her style is highly professional, graceful and sensitive and will be sure to work with the procedures you are comfortable with. Indeed, she is perceptive enough to give you a break or two during the procedure to help relieve stress.
So now I don’t have to call my dentist’s office a filling station anymore. Anyway I will be sure to visit Doc Rozana ‘root-inely’ while giving most of you dentally retarded nasty extractors who falsify the ‘tooth’ the brush off for good. That I swear by Holy Molars! After all, nothing ‘dentured’, nothing gained. So until my next dental visit, its tar-tar from me!”
