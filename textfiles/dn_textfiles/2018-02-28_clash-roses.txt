Clash of the roses

The buds failed to open up.
Flowers perished.
And plants withered.
As the War of Roses commenced from the Houses of York and Lancashire and ended upon the Bosworth Field in 1485.
This is the scenario that Shakespeare prepared before he embarked on writing RICHARD 111. The stage was set but not really because this tragedy had to be absolutely and historically correct. So, he derived his facts from chroniclers of his own who were Raphael Holinshed and Edward Hall. Earlier, Hall too depended on the accuracy of Richard's life based on by Sir Thomas More's personal contacts. As a More had lived in the household of John Morton who was the Bishop of Ely in RICHARD 111 but as a friend and adviser to Henry because he has had inside information though he remained on the side of Tudors.
Against rebels
There are two plays about his reign in Henry IV Parts 1 and 2. He stood well but died a tormented royal. The plays highlight the wars against Northern rebels and the way his son, Prince Hal turns to be an addict who later gives up all his habits demonstrating he was fit to be a king Shakespeare's greatest comedy character who appears in many of his plays, Sri John Falstaff is one of his drinking partners.
To understand the vicious wars between the English noble houses of York and Lancashire and their royalty involved, the best guide is William Shakespeare's plays who may not have been very familiar with English history, which marked the end of medieval English and the birth of the Renaissance.
This was the end of its thirty year period of strife and bloodshed, the shame of English which the succeeding generations have called the wars of roses. This saw the collapse of the great Plantagenet dynasty who were the rulers of all England and much of French for over three hundred years. It also saw the rise of the Tudors who were destined to dominate English political era during the next century followed by the triumph of Henry Tudor over RICHARD 111 at Bosworth Field. In my opinion, as well as many who would agree with me, Richard is the villain of the piece and responsible for the wars from which he met his own death.
The War of Roses preceded the reign of Richard 111 born in 1452 and died at Bosworth Field in 1485 which makes his reign one of the shortest in British History that exploded as one of the most famous as well as an infamous era of a king. The War of Roses laid the foundation for what was to become even before he ascended the throne with many gruesome killings and assassinations of those who stood in the way dividing the Houses of York and Lancashire. King Richard 111 achieved his ambition even sacrificing the lives of the two young and innocent princes along with his wife, Anne who was poisoned.
Conflicts and tension
Later, the descendants of Edward 111 who fought for the throne resulted in dividing the Houses of York and Lancashire paved the was to all conflicts and tension.
The story behind this period in England's history which Shakespeare investigated the complex along with the mysteries connecting the sudden marriage of Edward IV and the seizing of Edward's throne by his brother Richard of Gloucester that tied up one of the most heart-rendering killings of the innocence, Richard's nephews in the Tower of London. This gruesome act turned history in another direction which otherwise would have prevented the wars of roses. I read somewhere that a contemporary of Shakespeare saying that he hurried through these plays without blotting a line until history was genuine. They had come spontaneously from a full-charged mind. We can take it for granted his habit of historical research to please himself and perhaps some part of this intense reality, can make us understand the full impact of the wars of the roses, though many years apart.
But one must remember that Shakespeare was more concerned in a highly tensed drama over propaganda. He wrote the play making it much shorter time when and where events occurred. One example in the play that stands out is the scene where he sees his brother being led to the Tower of London while Richard goes straight to Henry's funeral and courts Lady Anne.
Shakespeare’s scene
Here, there is a lapse in history. It was seven years before Clarence was imprisoned that Richard married Anne. Critics assumed that Shakespeare opted to write in this manner regardless of history, was to bring into focus Richard's ruthlessness. For me, this theory does not fit anywhere because if I recall faintly the two events I wrote at an exam on British History, there was a flaw somewhere, Probably the time gap between Henry's death and Richard's marriage to Anne.
Shakespeare was determined to portray Richard as a villain much than he was, taking a cue from Nicolo Machiavelli's book the Prince where he advocates that a ruler must be cunning and ruthless to acquire anything he needs. Shakespeare emphasizes his ruthlessness, drawing attention to his deformed body and a hunched back but I am sure history has it that he had a very handsome face which he used for his conquests and succeeded even luring Anne into marriage. For those who may have read Hunchback of Notre Dame, there is a similarity between the two but the difference lay in the pathetic face that the hunchback had as against the incredibly attractive face of Richard.
Henry VI who is yet a child struggle among the lords who ruled England, and the French-led by Joan of Arc, win back the lands held by England. As a part of an agreement for peace, the boy Henry is married off to Princess Margaret of Anjou. This is followed by the wars of roses again when England is torn by civil war. For the battles to be won, Lancaster chooses red roses while Lancaster and white roses for Yorkshire. The disgraced son of Duke of York, Richard Plantagenet leads the Yorkists while the Duke of Gloucester leads Lancaster. They both engage in open battle and kill all those who oppose them, especially behind the scenes.
Single combat
With a heavy trail of mass murder committed against those whom he hated, Richard fights bravely as the war rages. He wishes to kill Richmond is a single combat and when the two meet at Bosworth, Edward is slain by Richmond.
One of the most colourful tragedies of Shakespeare where scores of royals that dot British history, are seen walking in and out it when and if it pleases the Bard to make this colossal tragedy more spectacular to please his audience.
The foulest deed was the killing of the two innocent princes, young Edward and his kid brother. But Shakespeare was also very vague about their assassinators who may have wished to please Edward. There is yet another view that the boy princes may have outlived Edward and put away by Henry VII. Whoever did it, he placed their bodies under the staircase of the Tower. And during the time of King Charles ll's reign, they were reburied in the Westminster Abbey.
Rose war
Like most historians, he was motivated by the subjects that he majored in; modern history at Oxford and Reading Universities. There is considerable scope for debate as to what acts lead to which consequences. The run-up to the War of Roses and the aftermath has dazzled the imagination of scholars as they unravel its hidden consequences and one such person is Robin Neillands who in his book, has handled the confusing period of English history. He is so minutely accurate to the dot, the book is enough even to do a theory by its self without any supportive subjects. That's how good he is. The beginning is uncertain. He questions:
a) Did trouble start when Henry Bolingbroke usurped the throne of Richard II?
B) When Henry V died in 1422 with his conquests incomplete
C) The power struggle between Cardinal Beaufort and Humphrey, Duke of Gloucester
d) When Henry VI concluded decades of his incompetent rule with bouts of insanity.
e) And much more who had their parts to play in the Wars of Roses.
Neillands kick starts this book with where The Hundred Years Of War ended, with the English defeat at Cotillion which was the final bout of relations between Dukes of York and Somerset which triggered the thirty year period. He traces the complexity of this period through to 1455 and continue to Battle of Bosworth Field where the formation adopted by King Richard's army to the foul deeds planned and committed by him; the medieval mysteries, the death of Edward, Prince of Wales, and the subsequent deaths of Richard, Duke of York, and the innocent young princes at the Tower.
For scholars past and present, students of English history and the general public in search of enlightenment on the Wars of the Roses, there can never be a book better than this.
