Brexit vote: Single market benefit ‘largely imaginary’

The trade benefits of belonging to the European Union have been “largely imaginary”, according to the social policy think-tank Civitas.
Its analysis argues that exports from non-EU countries to the single market have grown faster than the UK's, since its creation in 1993.
That lends weight to the argument that no EU deal is better than a bad deal, the author said.
Theresa May will start talks on the UK's departure from the EU on 29 March.
The prime minister will officially notify the EU of the UK's intention to leave by triggering “Article 50” and writing to European Council president Donald Tusk.
Economies that trade with the 11 founding members of the single market, using World Trade Organization (WTO) terms, have increased their exports to the EU five times faster than the UK has, over the past 20 years, the study says.
Michael Burrage, the report's author, said that before joining the single market in 1993, the UK's exports to the EU grew at a faster rate than major economies such as the US, Canada, Australia, Switzerland, Norway, South Africa and Brazil.
But since joining, export growth from those countries to the EU has now overtaken that of the UK's - a development he said was counterintuitive.
