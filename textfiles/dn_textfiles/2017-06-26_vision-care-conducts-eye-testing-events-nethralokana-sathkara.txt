Vision Care conducts  eye testing events of Nethralokana Sathkara

Vision Care held its ‘Nethralokana Sathkara’ in Galle, Kandy, Anuradhapura, Jaffna and Kurunegala recently. The events catered to over 1,500 applicants at each location in two phases.
These eye examinations were conducted to ensure each applicant received a customised pair of spectacles, suiting the condition of their eye.  The spectacles will be manufactured in the coming weeks, followed by an event to award them.
Nethralokana Sathkara is a project being conducted as part of Vision Care's 25 year celebrations this year, where 25,000 spectacles are being distributed free of charge among deserving people across Sri Lanka.
