St. Anthony’s Church, Kachchativu holds annual feast

The annual feast of St. Anthony’s Church, Kachchativu, held last Saturday, was attended by thousands of devotees from all parts of Sri Lanka as well as from India.
The flag-hoisting and special prayers took place on Friday evening, while the chief celebrants of the feast-day mass were the Bishop of Galle, Rt. Rev. Raymond Wickramasinghe and the Bishop of Jaffna, Rt. Rev. Justin B. Gnanapragasam.
As is customary, pilgrims from Rameswaran and nearby coastal hamlets in Tamil Nadu travelled to Kachchativu by boat, for this feast of the fishermen community.
Here are some pictures from the event captured by our staff photographer.
