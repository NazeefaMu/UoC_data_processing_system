EDB seminar on export opportunities in Pakistan

The EDB organized a seminar on 'Export opportunities in the Pakistan market' with the objective of increasing awareness of the market opportunities available in Pakistan for Sri Lankan products.
The Seminar was held on June 28 at the EDB Auditorium with the participation over 100 industrialists.
The seminar covered areas of business opportunities in Pakistan, concessions available under Pakistan-Sri Lanka FTA (PSFTA) and industry experience in doing business with Pakistan.
The information of the desk research done by the EDB and the findings of study done by the Sri Lanka Consulate General in Karachi on Sri Lanka tea in the Pakistan market was also shared.
Pakistani Acting High Commissioner Dr. Sarfraz Ahmed Khan Sipra said that Sri Lanka-Pakistan friendship is very important and explained the potential for the development of trade between the two countries.
Pakistan High Commission Commercial Secretary Adnan Younis Lodhi said that the progress of the FTA is now stagnated and that there is a need to agree on a deeper FTA with more product coverage along with Services and Investment chapters if we wish to see faster growth in economic relations.
He also announced that Sri Lanka has been granted the 'Guest Country' status at the Expo Pakistan exhibition to be held in Karachi in November 2017. This is the first occasion that Pakistan recognized a foreign country as ‘Guest Country' and this was granted to Sri Lanka under the MOU between EDB and Trade Development Authority in Pakistan.
Department of Commerce Deputy Director G.L. Gnanatheva provided detailed information on the PSFTA, its utilization and trends in consumer behavior of Pakistan towards our main exports of betel leaves, tea, etc.
Pakistan-Sri Lanka Business Council President Rohitha Thilakaratne stressed the need of visits of regular trade delegations and exhibitions in order to create a stronger relationship between the two countries’ business communities. Sri Lanka-Pakistan Friendship, Trade and Investment Association President Ifthikhar Aziz also shared the experiences of working with Pakistan business community and the opportunities available for Sri Lankan companies in Pakistan.
Exports to Pakistan was less than 1% of Sri Lanka’s total exports to the world. Sri Lanka needs to increase exports and expand production facilities where there is potential for trade.
In addition to the present exports, electronic and electrical components, value-added rubber products, porcelain products, paper products, processed food gems and jewellery can be identified as potential products for exports to Pakistan.
There are products for which there is high demand in Pakistan and adequate production in Sri Lanka, but less tariff concessions under the FTA. Therefore, it is necessary to develop strategies to explore opportunities in the Pakistan market for these products.
The PSFTA came into force on June 12, 2005. Pakistan implemented its final phasing out commitment and Sri Lanka has now duty free market access for more than 4,500 products. Approximately over 7,000 Certificates of Origin are issued annually under the PSFTA for Sri Lankan companies.
Sri Lanka’s export to Pakistan which was US$ 43 million in 2005 has marginally increased to US$ 64 milion in 2016. However, Sri Lanka’s imports from Pakistan which was US$ 116 million in 2005 has increased to US$ 281 million in 2010, US$ 297 million in 2015 and US$ 304 million in 2016 with an average growth of 9% during 2005-2016 period (Source: Sri Lanka Customs).
The major export products to Pakistan are tea, betel leaves, coconut, wood charcoal and pepper of the genus piper. Sri Lanka’s export product basket needs to be diversified to Pakistan as Sri Lanka’s main exports products in primary form are earning lower value export value. Only a few new products entered the Pakistan market including paper products and finished rubber products.
During the seminar, Sri Lankan companies of the herbal cosmetic sector, fisheries sector, aquarium fish sector and tea and rubber and tyre sectors raised their concerns mainly in the areas of FTA concessions, market access and the potential in the Pakistan market for their products.
Sri Lanka is aiming to achieve export earnings of US$ 20 million in 2020. To reach this target, the PSFTA should be exploited strategically considering that Pakistan being the 2nd largest economy in South Asia.
