Draw a ‘miracle’ from worst Barca display - Luis Enrique

MADRID, Sunday: Barcelona boss Luis Enrique lamented what he described as the worst display of his time in charge as the Catalan giants escaped with a 1-1 draw at Real Sociedad on Sunday.
Barca have now failed to win in their last eight visits to San Sebastian, but for once the slip-up felt like a victory as Sociedad dominated from start to finish. “The draw is positive because we take a point from a match in which it was practically impossible to take a point,” Enrique told BeIN Sports Spain
“Real Sociedad were infinitely better than us with and without the ball. They won all the battles. “It is almost a miracle that we took a point.”
Barca avoided defeat at Anoeta for the first time in five seasons, but fall six points adrift of La Liga leaders Real Madrid ahead of their meeting in El Clasico next weekend.
“As almost always happens here Real got the better of us and if someone was watching the game without seeing the colour of the shirts they would think the other team was Barca,” added Enrique. AFP
