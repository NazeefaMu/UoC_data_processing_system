Would have been a different story if not for ‘pathetic’ fielding: Mathews

CARDIFF, Monday: Sri Lankan captain Angelo Mathews described his side’s fielding performance against Pakistan as “pathetic” as they were dumped out of the ICC Champions Trophy 2017. Sri Lanka dropped three relatively straightforward catches, all off the bowling of Lasith Malinga, which allowed Pakistan to win the match by three wickets and set up a semi-final against England on Wednesday.
Defending a below par 236, Sri Lanka needed to take all the opportunities that came there way. They got off to the worst possible start after Azhar Ali was dropped in Malinga’s first over. Later, Sarfraz Ahmed, Pakistan’s best batsman on current form, was dropped twice, the first occasion when Pakistan still needed 43 runs to win. Had that been taken, it is likely that Sri Lanka would have gone on to win.
All three of the catches should have been caught - Thisara Perera’s drop of Sarfraz at mid-on when the batsman had 38 was about as easy a catch as you could see at international level - and Sri Lanka’s failure to take the chances on offer allowed Pakistan’s captain to lead his side to a nail-biting victory. He finished on 61 not out and shared an unbeaten 75-run partnership with Mohammad Amir for the eighth.
Not that this is a new problem for Sri Lanka. Their fielding has long been regarded as poor - they are hampered by a distinct lack of athleticism in some players and a lack of concentration in others - and it is something the team have admitted themselves. “Looking at today’s performance, I thought we were pathetic once again,” said Mathews. “If we had held those catches, it would have been a different story today, especially at very crucial times.”
Their performance in the field in this match was not for lack of effort. The Sri Lankan players threw themselves at everything today but their execution was found wanting. Perera never got his feet set so he was not ready when the ball arrived and Seekkuge Prasanna took his eye off the ball at the vital moment when diving forward on the deep square leg boundary to attempt to hold on to a Sarfraz pull shot. How to describe Danushka Gunathilaka’s drop off an Azhar Ali cut shot? It’s still hard to work out how he dropped it.
“The boys have worked extremely hard,” said Mathews in support of the effort his side have put in to their fielding when asked if the team was really giving their all in that department. “Today, yes, we dropped three catches, but there has been a genuine effort from the boys and from the support staff. We’ve expressed a lot about our fielding and we put a lot of energy on our fielding. So, yes, there has been a genuine effort.”
While the fielding was clearly under par so too was Sri Lanka’s batting performance. Well set at 161 for 3 with nineteen overs remaining, they were looking at a score of close to 300 but four wickets for seven runs in the next five overs changed the whole complexion of the game. In truth, Sri Lanka’s batsmen did little wrong against an inspired Amir and Junaid Khan but they needed to show more resolve on a wicket which was slow but which offered little in the way of lateral movement for either seam or spinners. This performance stood in stark contrast to their tremendous chase against India in the previous match.
Perhaps it was due to a lack of experience in the middle order. Injury to Kusal Perera and the suspension of Upul Tharanga for a slow over rate in the first match when he was captain robbed Sri Lanka of two of their frontline batsmen. That meant they were forced to pick Dhananjaya de Silva just 48 hours after arriving in the country. Mathews admitted it “wasn’t easy” for de Silva to come in to the side in such circumstances but suggested Sri Lanka’s hand was forced by the lack of other batting options within the squad and the conditions.
“We had to play the extra batsman on this,” he said. “We had to play the seventh batter because we knew there was some grass on the wicket. When you lose a game, you can always say it was poor batting, it was poor fielding, and it was poor bowling, but I thought it was kind of a funny wicket today. Yes, we were 30, 40 runs short obviously, but I’m really proud of the guys, the way they came out and tried to defend that. Unfortunately, the fielding let us down.”
The performance of Sri Lanka’s bowlers was the bright spot and Mathews, who marshalled his troops shrewdly in the field, said he was “really proud” of their efforts. The attack was led by Malinga who, at 33, has clearly lost a yard or two of pace yet he still managed to cause problems for the Pakistani batsmen with his unique mix of yorkers interspersed with the odd bouncer. It may be the last time he is seen on the global stage for Sri Lanka.
“He’s been a great servant for Sri Lanka cricket,” said Mathews. “He’s been fantastic. We saw the effort that he put in today as well. It was unfortunate that we dropped his catches.
He would have been a different bowler but still he came out and gave his heart. He is a champion.” That he is but Malinga and his Sri Lankan teammates will head back to their Cardiff hotel tonight knowing they let a brilliant opportunity to reach the semi-finals of this tournament slip through their fingers.
They have had some misfortune during this Champions Trophy but today, they had nobody to blame but themselves.
