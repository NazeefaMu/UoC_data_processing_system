‘Upgrade the quality of higher education’: Premier

 
Prime Minister Ranil Wickramasinghe gave directions to the Vice-Chancellors of all Universities to upgrade the quality of higher education instead of prioritizing the construction of university buildings.
The Prime Minister pointed out that the international status gained by local universities has dropped at present, and it is the duty of all Vice Chancellors to ensure that education in universities is raised once more to international standards.
Wickremesinghe made these observations at a meeting held at Temple Trees attended by Minister of Higher Education and Highways Lakshman Kiriella and Vice Chancellors of universities last morning.
The PM also said that immediate steps should be taken to put an end to ragging in university system and to create a healthy atmosphere for students to engage in academics successfully without any hindrance.
He said that in order to achieve that an additional staff will have to be recruited.
