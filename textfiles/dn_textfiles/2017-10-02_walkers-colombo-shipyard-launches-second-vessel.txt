Walkers Colombo Shipyard launches second vessel

Walkers Colombo Shipyard (Pvt) Ltd, a subsidiary of MTD Walkers PLC, has successfully completed the construction of its second vessel, a 10 tonne bollard pull tug ‘Seagulf 2’.
The barge designed and constructed entirely by in-house team of highly skilled naval architects and engineers under the guidance of Dr. Sarath Obeysekera, Managing Director of Walkers Colombo Shipyard (Pvt) Ltd., was launched recently at the Walkers Colombo Shipyard in Mutwal Harbour.
Built under supervision of Indian Register of Shipping which is the certifying authority for the vessels, the tug is of 16 m long and 5 m wide with draft of 1.65 m. The tug can handle a pollard pull of 10 tons and is equipped with two 400 horse power Cummins engine and a Cummins Generator.
Earlier this year, Walkers Colombo Shipyard designed and built a 1,000 tonne barge which was used by Walkers Piling (Pvt) Limited to carry out Sri Lanka’s first sea piling in the harbour basin for the installation of the 1,250 tonne capacity shiplift.
MTD Walkers PLC, Sri Lanka’s only fully integrated engineering solutions provider, expanded its presence in the Marine Engineering sector in 2015 by unveiling its plans to open a state of the art ship repair facility in Mutwal Harbour with an investment of over USD 8.5 million.
“The commissioning of the Ship Lift is planned for the end of this year which will enable high growth in dollar revenues and diversify Group revenue streams. We have already commenced ship building as demonstrated by the launch of two of our own vessels, the 750 tonne barge and the 10 tonne bollard pull tug boat launched recently. We are also building a 23 metre self -propelled barge for an export order and are in advanced negotiations for more new building opportunities” said Mahesh Yogarajan, Executive Director of Walkers Colombo Shipyard (Pvt) Ltd
Following up on previous statements, Mahesh Yogarajan indicated that the shipyard would soon announce a positive financing arrangement for the Shipyard.
