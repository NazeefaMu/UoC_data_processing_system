PARLIAMENT

 
‘Police will be directed to investigate purchasing of two ships’
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe yesterday told Parliament that he would direct the matter to the police to investigate and ascertain if there had been any fraud taken place in purchasing the two ships - Ceylon Breeze and Ceylon Princess during the previous regime.
He made this observation yesterday in Parliament in response to a question raised by UNP MP Nalin Bandara Jayamaha who asked if those two ships were reconditioned and sold to Sri Lanka through a fraudulent deal.
Nalin Bandara Jayamaha pointed out that at a time when the world shipping industry had collapsed, the previous government took measures to purchase two ships at a huge cost. He demanded to know the purchasing price of the ships and the purpose for which those ships were expected to be used.
The Prime Minister said that the two ships were bought over for the Ceylon Shipping Corporation at US dollars 35 million each. “They were bought to transport coal for the Norochcholai Coal Power plant and to the proposed Sampur Coal Power Plant,” Premier Wickramasinghe said and added “But the coal cannot be transported over six months of the year due to rough seas.”
The Premier said that relevant authorities have been instructed to decide if the two ships would be upgraded and used or to be sold out.
“The purchasing deal resulted in a loss of US dollars 30 million. The two ships could fetch only US dollars 40 million if we sell them off today,” Premier Wickramasinghe said. “We have not yet made any decision as the two ships. The Shipping Corporation has no ability to rent them out. However, a sum of Rs. 1,850 million as installment has to be paid once in six months for loans taken to purchase the ships. We will have to make a decision and take the option which would result in the least loss. We are to pay for the sins of the previous government.”
When Nalin Bandara Jayamaha asked as to when the two ships were manufactured, the Premier said according to the reports they their manufacture was commenced in 2014.
MP Jayamaha said according to an identification number of the ships it seemed that the two ships were manufactured in 1997 and added that he suspected that the previous regime might have fraudulently bought reconditioned ships. He queried as to what steps would be taken by the government in this connection?
At this stage the Premier said he would handover the matter to the Police to investigate.
‘Singarasa case’: Prime Minister requests ruling from Speaker
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe yesterday requested a ruling from the Speaker on the pronouncement of the Supreme Court in what has popularly known as ‘Singarasa case’ on the Constitutionality of competence of the President to accede to the Optional Protocol to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR).
He was replying to a question by UNP MP M. H. M. Salman during the Prime Minister’s Question round in Parliament.
“Sri Lanka acceded to first Optional Protocol to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights in 1997. In the same year the President said the Government of Sri Lanka recognises the competence of human rights committee to receive and consider communication from Sri Lankan citizens. However, at present it appears that the government is neither responding to communications brought to its attention by the Human Rights Committee nor taking any action in response to views expressed by it,” Salman said.
Replying to this statement, the Prime Minister said the government reconfirms the continued validity and applicability of the Optional Protocol to the ICCPR and is firmly committed to implement its provisions. He said the government intends to device a timeline and appropriate approach to responding the pending communications from the HRC.
The Prime Minister referring to the Singarasa case said, “The Supreme Court had in Singarasa case made a pronouncement that ‘The Constitution of Sri Lanka and the prevailing legal regime do not provide for release or retrial of a convicted person after his conviction is confirmed by the highest appellate court. Therefore the State does not have the legal authority to executive the decisions of the HRC to release the convict or grant a retrial. The government cannot be expected to act in any manner which is contrary to the Constitution’. If that was indeed the correct legal position, the application to the SC could have been dismissed on that ground alone. Instead the court went on to consider the constitutionality of the accession to the Optional Protocol. The Chief Justice with other judges concurring proceeded to make pronouncement denying the constitutional competence of the President of Sri Lanka to accede the Optional Protocol of the ICCPR. These pronouncements are obiter dicta being unnecessary for the determination of Singarasa’s application and do not serve as binding authority on the relevant question,” he said.
“There was Parliamentary unanimity that the First Optional Protocol should be entered into. I wish to point out that it is a fallacy to assume that this Protocol vests the UNHRC with any kind of judicial power. All that the Committee can do is to inquire in to any complaint it has received and express its views thereon. It is left to the host country to decide on the course of action thereafter. In Sri Lanka it is a decision that has to be taken by the Cabinet. The Cabinet is ultimately responsible to Parliament. The pronouncement of the SC in what has popularly known as Singarasa case that the accession of the Optional Protocol of the ICCPR needs a two thirds majority of the House and also the approval at a referendum is nothing but a perverted interpretation of the Constitution,” the Prime Minister noted.
“In my view it is nothing but an attempt by judiciary to usurp the powers of both the Legislature and the Executive. The obiter dicta of the Supreme Court violates Article 3, 4 and 27 (2) of the Constitution. The Supreme Court does not have the power to violate the basic tenants of the Constitution which unfortunately the SC had been doing in the last decade. The judicial power of people is not exercised by the Supreme Court, but by Parliament through courts or directly by Parliament. The courts that have followed the obiter dicta have violated the Constitution. This is a judicial coup against Parliament and sovereignty of the people. Instead of confining itself to the matters before it, the court has meandered into a total irrelevant area and made pronouncements on the Constitutionality of competence of the President to accede to the Optional Protocol. This I believe something that should be left to the Speaker of Parliament in this instance and I ask the Speaker after necessary consultation to give his ruling on this matter,” he said.
“The government led by President Maithripala Sirisena took immediate measures following the Presidential Elections in 2015 to give effect to all the pledges that we had given to the people. Good governance, rule of law, human rights, transparency, and accountability remain the cornerstone of the national unity government’s policy and vision. In keeping with this policy and vision, the government assured the Office of the High Commission for Human Rights in 2016 of continued participation in the communications procedure of the UN Human Rights Committee. It is our firm belief that engaging with all human rights mechanisms including the UNHRC established under the ICCPR constitutes the correct approach. In view of the government, the basis for Sri Lanka’s participation in the communications procedure of the UNHRC continues to remain. The government has the political will and ability to consider the options of the UNHRC and conveys responses and observations to the committee in terms of the policy of openness and constructive cooperation with UN human rights mechanism,” the Prime Minister explained.
The Premier said that he holds the firm view that responding to communications from HRC also flows from the fundamentals of our international engagement. “That is projecting Sri Lanka as a responsible nation in the international arena and pursuing action towards achieving the said goals is accordingly in order,” he said.
After the Premier’s Speech MP Dinesh Gunawardena requested a special debate on it. “The Prime Minister has today given an opinion and requested the chair to give a ruling on a very important judgement on the Constitution of Sri Lanka which has been delivered by the Supreme Court. We would like to have a debate on what the Prime Minister replied to the House before the Speaker gives a ruling on it. This is a very serious issue. After about 20 years, the Prime Minister have come to parliament and made a new opinion on the judgement delivered. That is a procedure that has not been followed by any Prime Minister,” Gunawardena said.
The Prime Minister agreeing to facilitate a debate said, “The Speaker should give the ruling after the necessary consultation and that could also mean the expression of views by the members of this House. I am happy that the MP has agreed with me that the jurisdiction of this rests with Parliament and not with the SC. I have not come with this opinion after 20 years. I continuously held it. Powers of Parliament cannot be taken away by SC as and when they like it. All I am trying to do is to take away the SC acting as a dictator and bringing it into Parliament. How can Article 3, 4D and 27 (2)A be run off by the obiter dicta of the SC. Our rights are taken away and we have been made prisoners. I think it will be interesting to have that debate. We have to reverse this trend.
Mr Anura Bandaranaike has given a ruling. You cannot have SC get around his ruling in other ways. This can also be a breach of privilege of the House. Because of this look at the number of jobs and foreign exchange that were lost. If we had this by now you would have far more jobs in the country. This is a national crime,” he added.
Deputy Speaker said the matter would be referred to the Speaker.
Govt to seek avenues to obtain details of foreign accounts
Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayake yesterday said in Parliament that he would seek avenues to obtain details of savings made in banks like Panama, Switzerland and other countries.
The minister said that he would discuss with President Maithripala Sirisena and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe and take measures to inquire from those banks whether they can disclose the details to the country. He said this request would be made following considering the plus and minus points of the request.
Karunanayake made this observation in response to a suggestion made by opposition MP Vasudeva Nanayakkara to request from those foreign banks to disclose the savings of Sri Lankans in those banks. He made this observation while responding to a question raised by opposition member Udaya Gammanpila during the round of questions for oral answers.
The minister also said during past attempts to find details only some banks had provided few details and most of those accounts have been maintained under fake names and added that Swiss banks have stated that they would not disclose the details of their account holders.
He said, however, the countries like Indonesia, Thailand and Malaysia are attempting to attract foreign dollars to their banks.
“They have granted an amnesty period of 15 years in a bid to attract dollars,” Minister Karunanayake said.
“We attempted to do so, but had to give up due to others criticisms. Now we are reluctant to use even the word ‘amnesty’ due to the past experience”.
In his response to MP Gammanpila, Minister Karunanayake said Sri Lankan foreign reserves are sufficient to cover four months of imports of the country and added that although the Brexit developments have affected many countries negatively, it has a positive effect on Sri Lanka.
He said during the recent past the foreign reserves have increased by USD 250 million.
The minister also said Sri Lanka's foreign debt has increased by Rs. 228 billion during 2015 as a result of the rupee depreciation against the US Dollar.
“Rupee was depreciated due to loans taken by the previous regime,” Minister Karunanayake said. “We have taken measures to transfer those excessive short term loans to long term low interest rate loans, to commence projects to attract dollars to Sri Lanka and to commence Colombo International Financial Centre to prevent the depreciation of the rupee.”
National Research Council Bill through with amendments
 The National Research Council of Sri Lanka Bill was passed with amendments yesterday in Parliament.
Commencing the second reading debate on National Research Council of Sri Lanka Bill, Technology and Research Minister Susil Premajayantha told the Parliament yesterday that the establishment of the National Research Council as a statutory entity is the main purpose of this Act.
The main objective of the National Research Council (NRC) is to assist the government to plan, coordinate and facilitate research in science and technology so as to build a vibrant national scientific and technological community in the country.
“With the creation of new research culture and adding commercial value for the research results Sri Lanka will open more foreign exchange earning avenues,” the minister said.
He said innovation is considered as the 12th factor of the Global Competitiveness Index. The government has already allocated funds through the 2016 Budget for the creation of a new research culture and also for the development of innovations.
“The ministry has taken various measures to encourage researchers to carry out more researches. Funds have already been allocated for the researches related to Dengue, CKDU, cancer and diabetic, etc.,” he said.
Minister Premajayantha said it was necessary to get the involvement of Sri Lankan researchers currently in abroad for the development of the country’s research and technology sector. He said some of them are assisting some research activities jointly conducted by Sri Lankan researchers.
Around 25 Sri Lankan researchers are currently working at the NASA institute. One of the researchers from Peradeniya University has won an award from US President Obama, Premajayantha said.
Salawa blast : Rs. 18 m allocated to pay compensation
 Rs. 18 million has already been made available to the Colombo District Secretariat to provide allowances to those whose property were destroyed due to the Salawa Army camp blast, Prime Minister Ranil Wickramasinghe said yesterday.
He also said that this allocation would be used to provide a Rs. 50,000 allowance to 276 houses and 52 businesses destroyed due to the blast.
The Premier said that some are not contended with this estimation and said their grievances will be further attended to.
The Prime Minister made these observations in Parliament during the round of questions to the Prime Minister.
The question was raised by opposition Parliamentarian Vasudeva Nanayakkara.
The Premier said that the money to provide reliefs to the people who were affected by the recent flood catastrophe has already been allocated.
“The government has enough money to provide relief to them,” Premier Wickremesinghe said.
“A sum of Rs. 109 million, Rs. 152 million, Rs. 9 million, Rs. 20 million, Rs. 4 million and Rs. 6 million have been allocated to the Colombo, Gampaha, Puttalam, Kegalle, Ratnapura and Kalutara districts respectively. They have been granted other reliefs in addition to this money allocations”.
The Premier said the lands are being identified to build houses for those whose houses were destroyed during natural disasters and added that this process takes a little longer but not years.
When MP Nanayakkara questioned the delay in acquiring lands, the Premier said that not only the lands have to be identified but the process includes to acquire them and to divide and grant them to the people. He said specially it was very difficult to find alternative lands in the Colombo district.
When MP Nanayakkara questioned as to why there was delay in acquiring lands in Ratnapura and Kegalle districts where there are enough plantation companies, the Premier stated that in some instances there was objections from the staff and however the companies have to remove some constructions in the identified lands.
“However, the issues will be addressed as soon as possible," Prime Minister Wickremesinghe said and added, “The affected people are our voters.”
Plantation workers' salaries : Ministry to sign bipartite agreement
Labour ad Trade Union Relations Minister W. D. J. Seneviratne told the Parliament yesterday that his ministry plans to take immediate measures to sign a bipartite agreement with regard to the salary increase of plantation sector workers.
He was responding to a question raised by UPFA MP Dinesh Gunawardena under Standing Order 23(2).
“The signing of a collective agreement shall only be entered after reaching an agreement consequent to the successful completion of negotiations between the plantation companies and trade unions,” the minister said.
Minister Seneviratne also said the salary increase of Rs. 2.500 to be paid monthly under the Budgetary Relief Allowance Act No. 4 of 2016 has still not been paid to their employees by certain private sector plantation companies.
“The ministry had also taken measures to provide financial assistance to pay the salary increase for the first two months by granting speedy loans considering the difficulties faced by plantation companies due to the decline of the prices of their produce,” he said.
The minister said a crisis situation has arisen due to some Presidents or Additional Magistrates of Labour Tribunals not granting permission to the representatives on behalf of their clients through letter of authorisation.
“I hope to discuss this matter with the Judicial Services Commission as well as with the Justice Minister and if required, I plan to introduce an Amendment to the Industrial Disputes Act by way of a direct provision that empowers representatives to appear for the aggrieved party upon a letter of authorisation,” Minister Seneviratne said.
He said that the prime objective in establishing Labour Tribunals was to enable the workers dismissed from service and living in abject poverty to seek relief at a minimal cost through a simple process.
 
Media should play constructive role in nation-building: President
Nirushi Wimalaweera
President Maithripala Sirisena yesterday observed that media should play a constructive role in nation building without resorting to mere criticism.
He said it was the responsibility of the media to criticise and point out the shortcomings and mistakes but also had an obligation to provide accurate information to the public for the benefit of the country.
The President lamented that some private television and radio stations were allocating 80 percent of air time to criticise the government, but was not giving enough space to make people aware about government policies and its development efforts.
President Sirisena expressed these views during a meeting with high officials of the Telecommunication Regulatory Commission of Sri Lanka (TRCSL). He made an inspection visit to the TRCSL head office yesterday.
The President also said that it has been brought to his notice that some electronic media were violating rules and regulations and misusing frequencies.
He also discussed with officials of amending the TRCSL act to given the institution more teeth to deal with such incidents.

S. Diyaghage, Southern roving cor
The Principal of a girls school in Galle has been noticed to appear in Court over an incident where a teacher of the same school had got children of a year 4 class to knock another girl on the head as a punishment for a minor offence committed by her.
The Galle Magistrate's Court noticed the Principal after a lawyer informed court that the student was still been harassed at school over the incident.
Rajapaksa family made several political mistakes: SB
Although former President Mahinda Rajapaksa saved the country from the clutches of terrorism, his family made several political mistakes, Social Empowerment and Welfare Minister S.B.Dissanayake said.
Addressing a media briefing in Colombo yesterday, he said former Minister Basil Rajapaksa should be held responsible for most of these major mistakes including the defeat of former President.
There is an allegation against Basil Rajapaksa for distributing money deposited in the Samurdhi Bank without charging interest to the people during the previous Presidential election.
This caused severe damage to the Samurdhi fund, Dissanayake said. Even though a survey revealed there is 91 percent of small scale entrepreneurs requiring loan facilities to develop their business, Basil Rajapaksa took measures to deposit Samurdhi money in banks at low interest rates neglecting these small scale entrepreneurs, the minister said.
He said the Sri Lanka Freedom Party will not be able to win the forthcoming local government election if members are divided as two separate groups at ground level.
"Certain elements are trying to create a division in the SLFP and they want to defeat the party at the upcoming election,” he added.
