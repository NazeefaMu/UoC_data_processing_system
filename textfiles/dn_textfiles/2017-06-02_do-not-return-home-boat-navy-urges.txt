Do not return home by boat, Navy urges

The Navy urges flood-affected people currently staying at safer locations not to return to their homes by small boats or rafts arbitrary until flood waters recede.
Navy Media Spokesman Chaminda Walakuluge yesterday told the Daily News that three members of the same family including a14-year-old boy have drowned after a raft toppled near Ogaspe Temple in Aththudawa, Matara while they were going back to their inundated home.
He said the bodies of a father, 38, his wife, 30, and their son had been recovered by the Navy.
He added that the efforts taken to send flood-affected people to safer locations will be in vain if they do not stay in these locations patiently until flood waters recede. “When floods recede, there will be a strong current which will drag things at a faster speed and boats travelling in receding flood water will be at risk,” he added.
