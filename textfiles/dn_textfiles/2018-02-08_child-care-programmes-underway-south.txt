Child-care programmes underway in South

The Southern Provincial Social Welfare, Probation and Child Care Services Department has initiated a novel programme to educate schoolchildren, parents, and community leaders on child abuse-prevention and implementing of law on child welfare and care.
Commenting on the programme, Southern Province Probation and Child Care Commissioner Mahesh Karrunanayake said that in initiating the programme, priority would be given to regions from where child abuse cases were reported largely according to the statistics of the Police Women and Childs’ Bureaus of the South. School principals would contribute towards the programme as programme promotion coordinators. Students of grade 8 and upward would take part in respective workshops, while educational sessions for parents would be organized at the respective schools. Rural-level educational programmes would be conducted for community leaders, Karrunanayake further said.
