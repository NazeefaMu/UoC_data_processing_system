Patriotism at what cost?

Although I had given up speaking or writing on politics and politicians since my retirement from public service. Most of my service, I had to work closely with ministers and had seen the deterioration of politics and politicians. The last was a minister who was assigned a portfolio he was clueless about on 1988. Addressing the staff on his first day he said: “Do as I tell you and they, who cannot, should find other places.” This issue of Minister Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe compels me to express my views dispassionately.
The hottest topic on the lips of every citizen in this country is the call for the resignation of Minister Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe on his loud mouthed call defying collective responsibility of the Cabinet on the question of leasing Hambantota Harbour to a Chinese Company. Here I would wish to quote from an unbiased, professional authoritative economist Amila Muthukutti appearing on one of the English dailies.
“Unfortunately, the opportunistic politicians, whose sole objective is to come to power, have mistaken economic matters for political matters, making patriotism a best-selling commodity on the political arena.
It is needless to say that the sale of revenue generating assets is a sin and should be stopped at any cost. However, the logic behind the fact that the sale of loss-making public enterprises has to be questioned, regardless of political ideologies. Public enterprises need to contribute to the economy rather than being financed by tax revenue.
On the other hand, the deal was to lease out the port, but not to sell. The Chinese Company will run the operations of the port over a 99-year lease. The question as to why the port had to be leased out is directly connected with the necessity of debt repayment as the country can no longer continue to finance for a loss-making enterprise. Now it has been proved that Sri Lanka is no longer capable of operating the port in a profitable manner, hence, linking it with an industry leader like China Merchant Port Holdings can be appreciated, as it has an enormous capacity to make it profitable. Accordingly, it can be stated that the necessity to lease it out is timely.”
Future generations
In my view, when the period of lease – 99 years - is over, the Chinese Company would have attracted more ships to patronize Hambantota Harbour and the government will have a profit making venture to carry on. Let our future generations enjoy the sacrifices made by us today.
It is very unfortunate that Wijeydasa Rajapakshe speaks to the gallery, the hoi polloi, rousing their feelings in the guise of patriotism. One worst call of his was the Maha Sangha to spearhead this call to stop this sale of country’s silver. Let him and all those who gullibly swallow this canard, be reminded the untold damage done to this country by introducing the ‘Sinhala Only’ Act by S W R D Bandaranaike pressurised by Buddhist monks, without giving him a chance to implement it in a phased manner, getting the cooperation of the Tamils in the North. The irony is that SWRD was murdered by a monk named Somarama.
Reconciliation efforts
Today, after a thirty-year bloody war, there appears to be no settlement although reconciliation efforts and overtures made. Let not economic disaster fall on this country by following pseudo patriots. One other factor he seems to ignore is that inviting the Maha Sangha to support his cause is further deterioration of Buddhism as those monks who have taken up to politics have given priority to political activities neglecting their religious activities, demonstrating in the unruly manner, not expected of monks.
One hidden or secret motive of Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe may be to contest the next Presidential Elections with the support of the Maha Sangha, under the guise of Patriotism. Time will tell.
It is very unfortunate, the government has failed to educate the masses, as to what led to leasing Hambantota Harbour and the commitments of the previous government.
Let me wind up by quoting Albert Einstein “Heroism on command. Senseless violence and all the loathsome nonsense that goes by the name of Patriotism – How passionately I hate.”
