Dhananjaya de Silva may replace Kusal Perera

Following the hamstring injury to Kusal Perera during the Champions trophy match against India on Thursday, Sri Lanka are flying 25-year-old all-rounder Dhananjaya de Silva as cover up.
De Silva will join spinner Dilruwan Perera as the third standby.
Kusal Perera was forced to retire hurt at 47 with a hamstring injury that saw him being helped off the field.
Preliminary medical investigations have revealed a possible lateral mid-hamstring injury.
Perera was due to undergo radiographic testing yesterday to ascertain the extent of his injury.
Sri Lanka has already called up one replacement with Danushka Gunathilaka coming in for injured Chamara Kapugedera.
Gunathilaka was one of two standby players on tour and made most of his inclusion in the team by scoring a brilliant half century that propelled Sri Lanka to a sensational seven-wicket win over defending champions India.
