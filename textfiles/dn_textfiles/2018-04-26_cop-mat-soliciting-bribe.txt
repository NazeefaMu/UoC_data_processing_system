Cop on the mat for soliciting bribe

The Colombo Chief Magistrate Lal Ranasinghe Bandara on last Tuesday (24) ordered to re- remand the Police Constable attached to the Colombo Fort Police Station who was arrested by the Commission to investigate allegations of bribery or corruption (CIABOC) on charge of accepting a bribe of Rs.10000.
The chief magistrate re-remanded the suspect until May 2. The complainant, a resident of Polonnaruwa had allegedly engaged in an illegal activity at the Fort Railway Station. The Police Constable had demanded a bribe of Rs 20,000 from the complainant not to take any legal actions against him.
Eventually, the amount had been reduced to Rs 10,000 and the Police Constable had seized the person’s NIC and mobile phone until the bribe was paid.
The constable was arrested when he was handing over the items back to the person after accepting the bribe.
