Caught in the act?

A high Fisheries Department official who accompanied three Parliamentarians attached to the Parliamentary Sub Committee on fisheries and other officials on an observation tour of the Kalpitiya sand bay coral sanctuary facing destruction due to illegal fishing was himself caught by the press with a line and sink in hand trying to catch fish in the coral reef. The officer was seen allegedly indulging in the illegal act by the journalists who accompanied the group on the observation tour. The journalists wondered whether the illegal fishermen were destroying the coral reef in cohorts with the high Fisheries Department officials for personal gain.
