Malinga preparing for ODI return after 2015

Sri Lanka’s match winning fast bowler Lasith Malinga is expected to return to One-Day International cricket after a lapse of two years after he was included in the squad of 15 for the ICC Champions Trophy in England in June.
Malinga’s last ODI for his country was against West Indies at Pallekele on November 7, 2015 and since then he has been battling a troubled knee that has restricted his appearances for his country only to T20 Internationals.
But since of late Malinga has expressed keenness to return to play fifty-over cricket especially in the ICC Champions trophy and Sri Lanka Cricket knowing the value of the player and what an important cog in the wheel he is for the team has worked with him assiduously towards getting him fit to bowl a full 10 overs in the fifty-over version of the game.

“Malinga is looking forward to playing in a 50-over match after two years. We took a medical assessment of Malinga’s fitness conditions. He has expressed that if he is selected he is willing to give his 100 percent to the team,” said chief selector Sanath Jayasuriya. “A cricketer like Malinga is an asset to any captain in the side with his experience.”
Sri Lanka Cricket president Thilanga Sumathipala said that SLC had got Malinga medically cleared and that he was now fit to play 10 overs.
“He was initially cleared medically to bowl a maximum of 4-5 overs which was too much of strain on him, but two weeks ago just before he left for the IPL he was declared fit to bowl 10 overs,” said Sumathipala.
“We are building him up for the 10-over game. Malinga playing in the IPL is to our advantage because he is with the top class cricketing environment and practicing. Right now we are getting reports that he is getting upto 8 overs and improving to 10 overs. We have to make sure that he is fit by about May 10 or so.
“We are expecting the players to be back from the IPL on May 9 especially the captain (Angelo Mathews) and we are looking at Malinga to be available for our four warm-up games in England. Those games are very important for him to play and bowl 10 overs. His physical fitness is superb it is match fitness which he is lacking now.
“He has to adapt himself he is such an important player we are looking to give him a match fitness test. He will travel to England with the team but if his match fitness is getting delayed we rather put him before high intensity training. What we want is for Malinga to play in the matches. According to the medical reports and evidence, we have to peak him slowly to play in the 10 overs. He is such an important player our plan is to leave him as he is. The captain wants him in the team and he himself is keen to play and win the Champions Ttrophy for the country. We are managing him and player management is what is taking place right now,” he said.
POOR FORM SEES CHANDIMAL LOSE VICE-CAPTAINCY
Poor form and injury has resulted in Dinesh Chandimal losing the vice-captaincy to Upul Tharanga.
Soon after the last ICC World T20, Sri Lanka Cricket announced that Angelo Mathews and Chandimal would be the long-term captain and vice-captains respectively till the 2019 World Cup.
However for the Champions Trophy in England in June, the national selectors named Tharanga as vice-captain to Mathews who will lead the team.
Explaining the change SLC president Thilanga Sumathipala said, “Policy wise we would like to see stability in the team. We are happy that Angelo is taking the responsibility and going through. First of all a player should have a place in the side. In the last few months or so Chandimal couldn’t sustain his place in the team in all three formats. When Angelo got injured the vice-captain also had an injury. Even though our vision is to have a permanent captain and vice captain time and time again due to injuries and various constraints we have to change.
“Right now the selectors are of the view in case Mathews is unable to play the best man to lead the team who is within the 15 is vice captain Upul Tharanga. Based on current form he is the best man who will have a place in the side. The vice captain should be able to fit into the 11 definitely. That’s fair thinking and it’s not to run down Dinesh Chandimal. We know how cricket goes there are outstanding players where we have to drop them but our intention is very clear. Chandiamal has got to perform in the team and make sure he has got a permanent place in the side. Policy wise we are still on board but the selectors are free to make recommendations based on current form and current strength of each and every player.”
