Executive Presidency is a must - Ven. Kotapola Amarakeerthi Thera

The Executive Presidency in Sri Lanka has to be made effective once again to bring situations like the current political crisis that we experience under control. Therefore, the Executive Presidency is a must, said Ven. Kotapola Amarakeerthi Thera, the Patron of the Shanthi Foundation and the incumbent Monk of the Colombo- Seruwila Buddhist Centre.
The Ven. Thera was addressing a media conference at SEMA building in Colombo yesterday.
“During the past few days, our Parliament has been in a very sorry state of affairs due to the bad influence of the stars. But, things are gradually returning to normal and we saw our Parliamentarians move in good spirits the last time Parliament met as the leaders of the political parties representing our people in Parliament have responded positively to the advice of the President. All Members of Parliament should keep in mind that the people are supreme and have the final say. Hence, it is the duty of the Members of Parliament to work to fulfill the people’s aspirations,” the Ven. Amarakeerthi Thera Thera added.
The media conference were organised by the Chief Monks of the country to air their views on the prevailing situation and political turmoil in the country.
Vice Chancellor of the Buddhist and Pali University, Colombo Ven. Prof. Gallelle Sumanasiri Thera presided.

Paraduwe Jinarathana Thera, Ven.Athuraliye Indrajothi Thera and Ven. Hegoda Vipassi Thera, Directorof the Paramadhama Research Centre, Ratmalana were among those present at the media conference.
