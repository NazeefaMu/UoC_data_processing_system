SLPP calls for Parliamentary elections - MP Aluthgamage

Sri Lanka Podu Jana Peramuna (SLPP) MP Mahindananda Aluthgamage speaking to the media said that the only way out of this crisis is to go for a General Election so to allow the citizens of this country to decide on whom they chose to have as their leaders.
Speaking at the SLPP headquarters, he said that former President Mahinda Rajapaksa cut short his term in office and called for snap elections because it is what people wanted at the time.
“He left gracefully when the results were in. It demonstrates that he respects democracy and the will of the people of this country.” Aluthgamage charged that the United National Party was shying away from calling for General Elections and wasting time dwelling on the crisis simply because they would not be able to garner the support they think they have.
“It is evident that Ranil Wickremesinghe cannot win the next election. Neither can the JVP nor the TNA. There are reasons why the TNA backed by Sumanthiran and Sampathan is supporting the coalition, it is because they were promised federalism,” he said. “Now there are elements stirring up in the North and East.”
