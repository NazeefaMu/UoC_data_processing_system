Public urged to condemn racism - JVP leader

JVP Leader Anura Kumara Dissanayake yesterday urged the public to completely condemn racism and take every possible measure to defeat racism.
He was addressing the media yesterday at the JVP Headquarters in Battaramulla.
“We lost valuable lives of our generation due to the ethnic conflict. People lived with fear. People of this country had to undergo various hardships and insecurity. So we should not put our children in to trouble as well. Our future generation should not face any type of conflict situation.” he said.
JVP Leader said that all the people in this country should realise that we all are human beings. People should defeat racism and should not leave any room for such kind of discrimination.
“Since its inception, JVP fought against racism. So we are ready to defeat racism without considering any obstacles.” Dissanayake assured.
He further said that racism can only divide the people as Sinhala, Muslim and Tamil but there is no any advantage for people.
“Racism doesn’t develop spontaneously. Some groups with various political agendas create these racial conflicts. But unfortunately, people those who have no idea about the ones who are behind this are also involving in these conflicts.” He said.
JVP Leader charged that both two main political parties are entertaining racism in order to fulfill their political objectives.
He stressed the government about the importance of creating no room for any future ethnic conflict in this country and urged media institutions not to give publicity for racism.
