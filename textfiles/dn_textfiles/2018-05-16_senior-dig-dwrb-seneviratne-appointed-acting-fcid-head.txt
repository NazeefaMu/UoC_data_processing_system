Senior DIG - D.W.R.B. Seneviratne appointed Acting FCID Head

Based on service requirement, until a new Senior DIG is appointed to the post, Inspector General of Police Pujith Jayasundara has appointed Senior DIG - D.W.R.B. Seneviratne as the Acting Head of the FCID, Police Media Spokesman SP Ruwan Gunasekara said.
Financial Crimes Investigations Division (FCID) Head Ravi Waidyalankara left the Police department on Monday having reached the mandatory retirement age of 60.
“IGP Pujith Jayasundara had earlier requested the Police Commission last month to accept Waidyalankara’s retirement as there was no provision to grant him an extension. The senior DIG was under investigation by the Special Investigation Unit and the Bribery Commission (CIABOC),” it is reported.
Waidyalankara had submitted his retirement papers last month, but there were moves to grant him an extension.
According to reliable sources, the next senior most DIG is Kandy DIG Mahinda Ekanayake. However, he is due to retire in a month’s time and measures will be taken to re-employ Ravi Waidyalankara on contract basis to head the FCID thereafter.
It is also learned that a Cabinet paper has been submitted seeking approval to employ Waidyalankara on contract basis.
