Schools actively involved in national reconciliation

Hindu College Bambalapitya with over 700 students was involved in national integration under the “Reconciliation friendly Schools Programme” initiated by President Maithripala Sirisena as the Minister of National Integration and Reconciliation. The reconciliation friendly school programme was held on June 30, and Australian High Commissioner Bryce Hutchession, participated as Chief Guest.
State Minister of National Integration and Reconciliation, A.H.M. Fowze, Deputy Minister of National Policies and Economic Affairs, Dr. Harsha De Silva, and Representative of Unicef, Tim Sutton, Secretary, Ministry of National Integration and Reconciliation V. Sivagnanasothy, Principal, Hindu College T.P. Parameswaran, and other dignitaries participated.
The objective of this event is to promote national integration and reconciliation among school teachers and children and empower school children as peace messengers and peace advocates in society. In a pluralistic society it is important to recognize the multi-religious, multi-ethnic and multi-cultural and multi-regional diversities as a source of strength and richness while inculcating the concept of mother-land as a theme for stronger integration and reconciliation, said the Secretary Ministry of National Integration and Reconciliation, Sivagnanasothy.
The school children and participants expressed the need for healing, reparation, transitional justice and arrangements for non-recurrence as important elements in the reconciliation process. Religious fanatism, ethnic extremism, regional extremism and racism and economic imbalances have affected national unity, co-existence, peace and reconciliation in the past. Lack of trust and mutual understanding have created divisions and segregation among societies in specific pockets. Shortsighted political and vested groups have been instrumental in creating disturbances through hate speeches and religious and ethnic clashes in such places.
The integration friendly school programme aims to create a change in the attitude , mindsets and behavioral patterns which calls for respect of other religions and ethnicities as a way forward, said Sivagnanasothy. The Government policy on official languages and singing the National Anthem in both languages has strengthened the integration process. The reconciliation declaration was read in all three languages and the students and school administration committed to continue the discussions as an on-going activity in the school assembly. The Australian High Commissioner explained the experiences of the Australian indigenous community reconciliation initiatives as a success story.
