The Megapolis and Western Development Ministry has taken measures to introduce Bus Priority Lanes (BPL) for Colombo city and the suburbs only during the rush hours from 6 a.m. to 9 a.m. with the intention of reducing traffic congestion, Megapolis and Western Development Minister Patali Champika Ranawaka said.

Considering the success of this pilot project, the Ministry has taken measures to introduce BPL's to other areas also. This will also improve road discipline,” the Minister said.
