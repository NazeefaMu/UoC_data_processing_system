Police aiming to climb up in rankings

The first records of Police rugby go back to 1880s’ where a team of Police officers participated in a rugby game at the ‘Kew Garden’ Park in Malay Street, Slave Island in 1881. In 1891 a team from the Pettah Police Station played a rugby match.
In 1961 Police SC playing in the ‘B’ Division were permitted to play alongside the Division ‘A’ clubs. The expanded competition, allowed all thirteen clubs to play each other once on a home and away basis in alternate years and at the end of the season the best eight teams went on to play in a knock-out tournament for the Clifford Cup.
The Police Sports Club was promoted to Division ‘A’ in 1967 and in the first year they made it to the Clifford Cup finals, defeating Dickoya MCC in the quarter-final and CR & FC in the semi-final before losing the final to Havelock Sports Club 3–11. They won their first Clifford Cup in 1970 under the captaincy of Abdul Majeed, forcing a draw in the final 6–6 with Havelock SC. The club went on to win its first Clifford Cup outright in 1972 when led by Anton Benedict defeating Colombo CH&FC 12–9. In the following year Police SC participated in another drawn Cup final, this time with Army SC.
The club won its first Division ‘A’ League title, which was then known as the ‘John Player League’ in 1979, under the captaincy of Charles Wijewardene and retained the title in the following year (1980) led by Nimal Lewke. They were successful again four years later in 1984 under Upali Vithanage, winning the Clifford Cup. Police SC went on to win six consecutive League titles from 1984-89. During this period the club won numerous Sevens wins and clinched the triple crown (the League title, Sevens and Clifford Cup) twice. In 1985 under the leadership of Sunil Sahabandu, they were unbeaten in the League, won the Clifford Cup by defeating Havelock SC 22-16 and were also victorious in the Sevens competition. In 1986 under H. Premasiri they retained the League title, and in 1987 under Asiri ‘Muruga’ Jayaratne they won the League title and the Sevens. In 1988 Ajantha Samarakoon captained them to win a double again. In 1989 they enjoyed their most successful season under Hafeel Marso clinching the triple crown.
In 1990 they were heading the League points table at the end of the first round but had to withdraw from the competition due to the LTTE war. In 1991 under Hemantha Yatawara Police won the League and Clifford Cup, their last titles to date. In the last couple of seasons they have consecutively won the Plate title but have failed to progress any further.
Police SC will be captained by their hardy hooker Jayanga Silva, who is an old boy of Prince of Wales College, Moratuwa for the 2017/18 rugby season.
Players who have left to other clubs this season are national players in the likes of Mohamad Abzal (Navy SC), Terence Henry (CH and FC), Musheen Faleel (Navy SC) and Udara Gayan (CR & FC). But even with their presence it did not pay off well for the cops in their last season obtaining a disasters 7th position in the Dialog ‘A’ Division Inter Club League tournament and crashing out in the quarter finals of the Dialog Clifford Cup knock out tourney.
The new players who have joined Police this year are ex-Zahira College fly half Hasan Sinhawansa, experienced club rugby player and hooker Lahiru Pawithra, former Vidyartha College prop Hashan Fernando and old Peterite fierce third row forward Sajith Seram.
This year the Police team is coached by veteran rugby coach Shamly Nawaz who has a vast experience in the coaching field and Chammika Ranasinghe will be the Assistant Manager of the Police rugby team.
Police will come out for the first time this season against Havelock’s Sports Club in the curtain raiser on November 4th at Havelock Park with the kick off at 6:30pm.
