No decision to release Indian boats in Lankan custody :Amaraweera

No decision has been taken to release Indian fishing boats in Sri Lanka custody, Fisheries and Aquatic Resources Minister Mahinda Amaraweera said.
He dismissed as false and baseless news reports that Sri Lanka authorities are taking steps to release Indian boats.
He said none of the Indian boats seized for poaching in Indian waters since 2015 were released. There are about 130 Indian boats in Sri Lanka custody.
They had been forfeited after producing in courts.
The operation to seize Indian boats trespassing into Sri Lankan waters for illegal fishing continues, he said.
The minister said before 2015 too Indian boats poaching in Sri Lankan waters were seized, but they were later released.
