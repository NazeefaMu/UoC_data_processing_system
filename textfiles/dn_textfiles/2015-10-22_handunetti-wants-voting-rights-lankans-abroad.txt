Handunetti wants voting rights for Lankans abroad

JVP MP Sunil Handunetti yesterday handed over a letter to Speaker Karu Jayasuriya urging him to appoint a special committee to look into the possibility of granting voting rights to Sri Lankans abroad.
The MP through this letter signed by 22 parliamentarians representing the UNP and SLFP has urged the Speaker to appoint this committee to look into the possibility of granting voting rights to the Sri Lankans aboroad and make necessary recommendations to the House in this regard.
Every Sri Lankan has been ensured the voting right but the Sri Lankans expatriate community has not yet been ensured this right, the letter said.
The letter said that the Sri Lankan expatriate community is contributing enormously towards the economy of the country and it is the right of every government to prepare the ground for them to live with dignity.
The Parliamentarians requested the Speaker to appoint a committee to look into the possibility of granting them voting rights.
