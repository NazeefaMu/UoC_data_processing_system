Arsenal mark Wenger's final home game with 5-0 thrashing of Burnley

LONDON, Sunday - Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger signed off in style as they thrashed Burnley 5-0 in his last Premier League home game on Sunday with the kind of dominant performance he would have wanted after 22 years in charge.
Wenger was given a guard of honour from both teams and the match officials before kickoff, and received roars of support throughout the match from the home fans, most of whom had donned their complimentary red “Merci Arsene” T-shirts.
Arsenal’s January record signing, Gabon striker Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang, opened the scoring in the 14th minute at The Emirates, racing into the area to guide home Alexandre Lacazette’s cross with the outside of his right foot.
France striker Lacazette then doubled the lead for the Gunners just before halftime, volleying in a low ball from Hector Bellerin on the right side of the goal. Second-half strikes from Sead Kolasinac, Aubameyang again and Alex Iwobi put the game well beyond Burnley’s reach. – AFP
