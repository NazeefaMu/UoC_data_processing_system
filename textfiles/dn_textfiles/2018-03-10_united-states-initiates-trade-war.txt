United States initiates trade war

President Donald Trump announced a 25 percent hike in taxes on steel imports and a 10 percent hike in tax on Aluminium imports to the United States. This could trigger a trade war among major trading nations of the world.
The United States is the world’s largest steel importer. The European Union which is the biggest steel exporter to the United States is worst affected by the US decision. It vowed to retaliate. It is likely to petition the World Trade Organization (WTO) against the United States. WTO Director-General Roberto Azevdo has said that the US action could cause a worldwide recession.
Among other countries affected are China, Russia, Canada and South Korea. The latter has already announced its intention to complain to the WTO. The US earlier announced increased tariffs on import of washing machines, solar panels and arrange of intermediate goods. Korea is worried that a trade war between the United States and China to which it exports over 60 percent of its steel, auto-parts and intermediate goods could affect it adversely.
Meanwhile the United Sates energy industry which relies heavily on imported steel has opposed President Trump’s decision to increase steel import tariffs since it would affect it by increasing prices of its products.
This decision could also increase the United States isolation in many fields. Earlier it withdrew from the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). Now 11 nations in America and the Pacific have signed a Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP) without the United States. These countries include Canada, Japan, Mexico and Chile among others. They agreed to reduce tariffs by 10 percent.
Inter-Korean relations warm up
In contrast to the highly tense relations between the two Koreas during the time of the expedited development of North Korean nuclear weapons and missile programme, relations between them become warmer since North Koreas participation in the winter Olympics and subsequent exchanges of visits by high level delegations.
The latest visit was that by South Korean National Security Council Chief Chun Eui-yong and National Intelligence Service Chief Suh Hoon to Pyongyang early this week. The delegation was very warmly received and President Kim Jong-Un himself received it within hours of their arrival there.
During the discussions North Korea is supposed to have expressed its agreement to halt its nuclear weapon development programme in exchange for denuclearization of the Korean peninsula. Official North Korean News Agency reported that “It is the consistent principled position of the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea (DPRK) to resolve issues in a diplomatic and peaceful way through dialogue and negotiation”.
It is also reported that North Korea has agreed to release three US citizens detained there if the planned US-South Korean military drills this month are to be postponed or not held on a grander scale than earlier.
President Moon Jae-in of South Korea is expected to meet North Korean President Kim Jong Un in the border village of Panmunjam, South Korea at the end of April.
The two South Korean Security and Intelligence Chiefs flew to Washington to brief US National Security Advisor H R McMaster and other officials to brief them on their Northern visit. They are expected to deliver a special message from the DPRK to the United States.
However, the signals from Washington remain mixed. While President Trump has not gone back on his vow to use all options including war, he has also said that he is ready to meet the North Korean Leader. In the meantime the US has imposed tougher sanctions on North Korea.
China has welcomed the thaw in inter-Korean relations and stressed that North Korea’s security interests should be addressed in exchange for denuclearization.
A 500-strong cheer group from the North is expected to attend the Winter Olympics in South Korea in addition to 47 athletes. North Korea has also invited a taekwondo team for a demonstration and artistes for a musical show in Pyongyang.
Italian elections show shift to far Right
Parliamentary elections in Italy held on March 4 have produced no outright winner. No single party or an alliance has secured a majority in the 630 member Lower House of Parliament. The 5 Star Movement which has won 222-4 seats obtaining 32 percent of the vote is the largest party in Parliament. The coalition led by the far right The League has won 267 seats obtaining 37 percent of the votes. The Democratic Party (PD) has won only 123-5 seats.
As in France the traditional parties have lost and new emerging parties have come to the forefront. It is clear that anti-immigrant, anti-Establishment and anti-European Union sentiments have risen among the voters. The Brexit vote in the United Kingdom also showed a similar trend which did not augur well for the future of the European Union. Italian voters have also expressed their dislike to the European single currency.
It is not clear whether parties and coalitions would be able to form a government, though various coalition options are available. In case they fail to agree on a government the President will have to call for fresh elections. In post-Second World War history Italy has almost never had a government which lasted its full term of office.
