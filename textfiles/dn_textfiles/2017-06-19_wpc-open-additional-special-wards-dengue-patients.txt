WPC to open additional special wards for dengue patients

The Western Provincial Council Health Ministry is to open special wards at the Piliyandala, Thalangama, and Wethara Hospital in Polgasowita to accommodate the increasing number of dengue patients in the Western Province, a Ministry spokesman said.
He said the step was taken as the Gothatuwa Infectious Diseases Hospital (IDH) earmarked for 500 dengue patients had almost doubled that number of indoor patients.
The Colombo South Hospital at Kalubowila and the Homagama hospital have a large number of dengue patients and therefore, the Provincial Health Ministry decided to open new wards by deploying teams of specialists and other health staff, he said.
He said President Maithripala Sirisena, who visited the IDH on an inspection tour, directed relevant authorities to supply all resources needed to cope with the emergency expeditiously.
He said 14,188 dengue patients were reported from the Colombo district with Homagama accounting for a major share of it.
“So far 17 patients had died of dengue in Homagama,” he said.
