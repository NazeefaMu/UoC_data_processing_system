Kiriella tells Parliament: New constitution govt’s aim

With support of SLFP:
Followed by referendum:
The government’s objective is to bring forth the new Constitution, followed by a referendum with the support of the SLFP, Leader of the House Lakshman Kiriella said in Parliament yesterday, in reply to a question by MP Wimal Weerawansa.
Weerawansa questioned the Leader of the House, if Foreign Minister Mangala Samaraweera had made a statement to the foreign media that the government was to adopt a new constitution.
Kiriella said the government is optimistic about the new Constitution.
“The government is very clear on two main points. One, we will bring forth a new constitution. Then we will go for a referendum,” he said.
Kiriella pointed out the government will not adopt the new Constitution behind closed doors.
He said there are certain political parties still presenting their proposals for the new constitution.
“When we receive all proposals from all parties, we will table the draft in Parliament,” Kiriella said.
He also pointed out it was former  President Mahinda Rajapaksa who said the 13th Amendment wasn’t enough.
“It was the former President who wanted 13 Plus,” Kiriella pointed out.
MP Weerawansa asserted that the new Constitution is a a federal Constitution which fulfils the needs of separatists.
Kiriella in reply said, the government will steer the new Constitution within the provisions of the 13th Amendment to the Constitution.
