UK’s NHS performs life-saving surgery on Lankan

The UK’s National Health Service (NHS) gets a lot of flak in the British press and on social media, but for two Sri Lankan tourists, the NHS proved to be a god-send on a recent trip.
Subash and Sriyani, a husband and wife duo en route to Sri Lanka from the US, decided to stay over at a friend’s house in London for a few days. They came to London to July 10 and that very night, Sriyani developed a terrible pain in her urinary tract, with difficulty in passing urine. They tried various herbal and off-the-shelf medications to alleviate the pain over the next day, but nothing seemed to work.
Then on July 12, their friend suggested they visit the nearby NHS Northwick Park Hospital located in Harrow, Middlesex. They went there around 5 pm and Consultant Urologist Dr. David Manson-Bahr recommended some tests and scans. The tests were done that same afternoon and the scan was scheduled for July 13.
“When the scan results came back, the doctor told us the prognosis was not good; Sriyani had developed a kidney stone, which caused the pain. The recommendation was to insert a stent to reduce the pain and ensure the flow of urine,” recalled Subash.
Luckily, they had worldwide travel insurance. The insurer had earlier assured that genuine claims would be promptly settled, so the financial aspect of the surgery would be taken care of. But the only problem was that the clock was ticking; it was already Friday afternoon in London. Repeated calls to the insurer went unanswered. When at last someone answered, they were told that the claim could be processed only the following week, when the office reopened again. As for cash, they just did not have enough to cover a surgery of such scale.
“We were desperate. She could not bear the pain any longer, so we thought of flying back to Sri Lanka that night. We implored the surgeon to give her some painkillers for the journey and allow her to fly,” Subash said.
“Dr. Bahr took me to a side and explained that it would not be possible. He explained that no airline would let her board and even if that were managed, if something happened mid-air, the plane would divert to the nearest airport and offload the passenger to the nearest hospital. We might have to bear the cost of the diversion as well,” he added.
Subash and Sriyani were at their wit’s end, unable to fathom what should be done.
“I will see what I can do,” Dr. Bahr told the couple and went in to his consultation chambers. He emerged around 30 minutes later and said, “You do not have to worry anymore. I had a chat over the telephone with my boss to explain the situation and he agreed that we should do the surgery free of charge immediately,” he said.
“Once we regained our composure, I stammered and said doctor, you do not have to do that; we will somehow manage till Monday,” Subash told the Daily News. It was Dr. Bahr’s turn to reply:
“Trust me on this, we are going to do this. You can worry about the money later.”
With those words, the patient was immediately wheeled into the theatre where the surgery was completed in less than an hour. After a day’s observation, she was discharged and deemed fit enough to fly. Additional medication was provided for use during the flight home. The couple returned to Sri Lanka the next day.
They had since undergone further treatment at a local hospital where doctors had praised the UK’s NHS Hospital for their quick thinking and generous offer. “We are deeply indebted to Dr. Bahr, Dr. Anish Patel, their superiors, the hospital staff and the Government of the UK, for the courtesy extended to us during our time of need. We do not know what would have happened if they did not take the decision to operate for free at the time.
It was a deeply moving experience which we will never forget,” Subash added. Since then, Sriyani has had additional treatment and made a complete recovery, marking a happy end to a tale that could have ended on a very different note, if not for the timely intervention of a British doctor who adhered to the Hippocratic Oath in letter and in spirit.
