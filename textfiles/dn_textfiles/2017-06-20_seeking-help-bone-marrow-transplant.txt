Seeking help for bone marrow transplant

D. Oshada Vimukthi Hasaranga, 11, of No. 246, Meegahawatta, Delgoda is suffering from acute Leukaemia and warded at the Maharagama Apeksha hospital. Doctors treating him have recommended a bone marrow transplant within three months to save his life.
The surgery to be done in a private hospital in Sri Lanka is estimated to cost nearly Rs 5.5 million. Vimukthi's father, Duminda Aruna Shantha, says that being a driver by profession, he is unable to afford such an expenditure.
He requests Philanthropists and the public to assist his child by sending whatever financial contributions possible to help expedite the surgery.
All contributions should be remitted to account number 119200138161612 at the Peoples Bank, Naranhenpita branch, opened in the name of Aruna Shantha Divgirige Duminda.
His contact number is 0713211613.
