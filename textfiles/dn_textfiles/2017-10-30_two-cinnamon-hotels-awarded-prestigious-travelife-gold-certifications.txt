Two Cinnamon hotels awarded Prestigious Travelife Gold Certifications

Cinnamon Bey Beruwela and Hikka Tranz by Cinnamon attained Travelife Gold Certifications, which are recognized as one of the global tourism industry’s most comprehensive and credible sustainability accolades. Both hotels were awarded the certifications after successfully meeting the Travelife standards for hotels, which are based on requirements set by the Global Sustainable Tourism Council (GSTC).
Travelife Gold Certificationis awarded to hotels and properties that demonstrate best practices in a range of areas including environmental sustainability, contributions to the local economy, employee well-being and community development. Launched in 2007, Travelife is a web-based certification system that allows accommodation providers to monitor and assess their sustainability performance.
The programme recognizes hotels that make a difference through their economic, social and environmental impacts. Initially introduced as a stepping stone for hotels and accommodation providers to become more sustainable in their operation, over the years, the Travelife organization has adopted more extensive and stipulating criteria for assessment. Hotels with Travelife Gold Certification have to be environmentally sustainable in their operations, they have to demonstrate how they uplift the local economy and support local businesses.
They also have to show how they safeguard the community including children and youth and take strides to protect the local cultural, historical and natural heritage of the areas that they are located in. This highly acclaimed certification is awarded to entities within the hospitality industry that invest both time and resources into their operational efforts and demonstrate that they have a committed management team and staff who are passionate about running a green business that protects the environment and local communities.
