ACL Cables gets Master Brand status

Sri Lanka’s No. 1 cable manufacturer in Sri Lanka, ACL Cables PLC achieved the prestigious Master Brand status for 2017, conferred by Chief Marketing Officers (CMO) Asia in partnership with the World Marketing Congress.
At a ceremony held recently, at Taj Samudra Hotel Colombo, presided by Education Minister Akila Viraj Kariyawasam as Chief Guest, ACL Cables was recognized for its superior brand value including its ascendency as the country’s premier cable provider.
A Master Brand status is conferred only to top tier brands in a particular category and in recognition of market dominance. Once the status is awarded on a single brand, the competing brands are excluded from the category.
While selecting the Master Brand, CMO Asia carries out a detailed research evaluating all competing brands in the category considering criteria such as a brand’s leadership, brand growth, brand evolution, longevity, goodwill, customer loyalty and overall market acceptance.
Commenting on the new status, ACL Cables Managing Director Suren Madanayake said, “We are pleased to win the above award proving ACL Cables as the No. 1 cable brand in the market. This esteemed status would not be possible without our steadfast customers including consumers, dealers, distributors and project customers."
“ACL has continuously maintained a strong brand health creating positive brand experiences for all our customers. Quality has also become the bedrock of our brand and during new product development. Our new products such as the fire retardant and fire resistant cables, which has been tested and approved in accordance with national and international standards are examples of how we strive to maintain long term brand value.”
“The economic brandscape is going through an interesting phase with a healthy mix of popular international brands and local home-grown brands emerging in every category. That is why Master Brands outlive time and are indexed only to an evolving market thus forcing a sense of re-evaluation upon them. These brands are the brands that are here to stay,” said CMO Asia Executive Director Dr. Aalok Pandit.
“A Master Brand is a brand that has made it big. Master Brand in reality is a passion - a brand which has scaled the highest peak in the passion-scale of brands and their respective consumers. It is a passion of passions. Therefore, let’s respect the Master Brand for what it is. It is an exclusive club. Not too many members in this league. The esteemed and distinguished panel is confident that ACL Cables is a successful case in point to deserve the iconic status of a Master Brand,” he added.
ACL Cables holds a market share of 70% with an annual revenue of Rs 14.6 billion.
