Google to further help  Chinese companies go global

Google Inc will step up efforts to help Chinese companies expand their presence in countries and regions involved in the Belt and Road initiative, as the United States tech giant aims to grow its advertising revenue from the country, company executives said. Annabel Lin, director of sales at Google China, said Chinese companies are making a strong push to go global, which will bring good opportunities for the company.
“Clients including cross-border e-commerce and other export-focused companies are growing at a double-digit rate. We hope their strong momentum can also be reflected in our own business,” Lin said.
On Tuesday, the company published a white paper to analyze markets related to the Belt and Road Initiative by partnering with Peking University, in a move to help Chinese companies find proper ways to expand their business in related economies. Google also unveiled a list of the top 50 Chinese global brand builders in partnership with the global advertising company WPP and Kantar Millward Brown. The 2018 rankings list the Chinese brands that have most successfully established a presence in overseas markets. Consumer electronics companies such as Huawei, Oppo and DJI are among the fastest-growing Chinese brands. Lenovo is ranked as No 1 on the list. China Business News
