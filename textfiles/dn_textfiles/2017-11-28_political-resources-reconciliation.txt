Political resources for reconciliation

The District Inter Religious Committees of Sri Lanka gathered in Colombo recently and exchanged their experiences of interreligious cooperation and collaboration in aspects of reconciliation among the variety of people living side by side in all the parts of Sri Lanka.
The undue intrusion of corrupt politics into the lives of people have so adversely influenced the lives of all our people who left to themselves would have adjusted their lives to live cordially together as decent fellow human beings.
For all the plastering and patching up between the two parties of the coalition government and the reality of an atmosphere free from fear of arbitrary arrests, threats, white vans and grease devils of the despicable political culture of the Rajapaksa era, there does not appear to the people a solid and united front of the government embarking on and vigorously pursuing a culture of genuine reconciliation based on equality of human dignity, rights, freedoms and equality of all the citizens belonging to the various ethnic, religious and cultural groups in Sri Lanka.
This is still strongly felt by the minorities in Sri Lanka in spite of the praiseworthy actions of the Minister and the National Co-existence, Dialogue and Official Languages Ministry to ‘unite all people living in the island under the Sri Lankan identity’ because all the ministers do not have the right attitude and do not pull together with the intention of binding the various communities of people as Sri Lankans. Because they are politically divided, they bring to bear their partisan and personal political attitudes on matters of national policy. Whether their breadth of vision is narrowed by their political outlook, opportunism, prejudice, racial or family background needs to be examined.
Due to a lack of clarity on national policy, each minister as well as each MP, Provincial Counsellor and Local Government Representative seems to show forth a different attitude towards human dignity, equality, non-discrimination, impartiality as their fancy takes them. Not only do many of them show a glaring lack of intellectual, moral, psychological and emotional maturity, they show forth and display their racial and religious prejudices in a manner that affect also the public servants working under them who become reluctant to cooperate and collaborate in affairs that devolve to the common good.
STOOPING LOW
There was a time when Sinhala Buddhists, Tamil Hindus, Muslims, Burghers and Malays, Sinhala and Tamil Catholics students studied together in the same grade and school. Though they knew each one’s ethnic and religious background and identity, it did not stand in the way of their feeling and acting as classmates and schoolmates. We were so much bonded together that we even called ourselves ‘clash mates’ when we competed and clashed with others in various sports. There was great camaraderie and friendship, the give and take and mutual sharing that overcame the petty quarrels we had now and then. Those quarrels were very temporary affairs; they never dragged on for years and years so much so that because of our solid friendship we do not even remember what we quarrelled over just as we do not remember what we quarrelled over as brothers and sisters in the bosom of our families.
Why do we become so petty and carping, untruthful and antagonistic, deceitful and vicious in politics and public life while showing a façade of religiosity by artfully planned visits to places of worship and making token offerings which indeed become rotten offerings due to the cunning, hypocrisy and meanness hidden in the heart hidden beneath an immaculate dress but very apparent to the onlooker who has been observant over a period of time of the public behaviour of politicians and their henchmen contrasting with their private conduct in the domestic environment?
From the politician, public bureaucrat, education administrator, school principal and teacher to the three-wheeler driver, all wish to appear as benevolent, gracious providers of service to all and sundry while they actually practice blackmail, extortion and deception not only on the gullible but also on the helpless. Why do we stoop so low to outwit one another? Is that what the family background about which so many are very proud, religious upbringing and educational training, obtained free, have brought us to?
MISCONCEIVING RECONCILIATION
Then there are some who plan to come to power by becoming political thugs. They openly threaten the peace-loving people. They disturb the social peace and reconciliation by their threatening words that activate provocative social behaviour and instigate criminal action. They should be arraigned before the law. The majority of the people and the government should not become helpless onlookers before these uncouth, hateful and coarse characters who exhibit their propensity to thuggery for political ends.
Reconciliation is not about compromising on the democratic values and the rule of law and the equality of all the citizens that should be always upheld in Sri Lanka without conceding to some people the privilege of being above the law.
If politicians or those intending to become politicians do not understand the concept of reconciliation as a noble way of life among decent human beings and something in every way profitable to Sri Lanka, their heads need to be examined.
Social stability and peace are absolutely necessary for social progress and economic development. The New Constitution should be so framed as to gain the confidence and support of the great majority of the people along with the definitive solution of National Question. A political climate would be so created where every citizen is equal to every other before the law, no person or section of the people are marginalized or made to feel subservient to any other person or section due to their money bags, funds in foreign banks, various ‘connections’ political or otherwise.
RECOUPING SRI LANKA’S GOOD NAME
The good name of Sri Lanka that has been besmirched by the chauvinists and anarchists who are greedy over what rightly belongs to others. People in foreign lands think of the majority community in Sri Lanka as a selfish people who do not know how to share and live in a civilized manner and are incapable of getting along and living with others in solidarity and in amity.
It has fallen to the present generation living in the North and South, East and West of Sri Lanka to usher a new political culture and redeem her good name as befitting those who live in the Pearl of the Indian Ocean.
