An industry veteran of 24 years, Herat joins the firm from National Asset Management Ltd. (NAMAL) where he served as Executive Director and Chief Executive Officer. NAMAL is a leading provider of unit trusts and individual portfolio management services across equity and fixed income instruments.

This will help us develop a unique client offering.” He emphasized that “Independence and fiduciary responsibility to clients will be a mainstay of our business model. We will exercise high compliance standards which will separate the business from other affiliate business-lines, and on the principle of ‘open-architecture’ - working closely with several carefully selected financial product providers.”
