The last laugh is with Hathurusingha

What happened at the P Sara Oval where Sri Lanka were beaten for the first time in a Test match by Bangladesh would never have occurred had Chandika Hathurusingha not been head coach in the opposition’s camp.
The events that led to him ending up as coach of Bangladesh instead of Sri Lanka have been well documented in the past and for those who cannot remember how that happened you’ll have to question the interim administration that was headed by former Sri Lanka cricketer Somachandra de Silva who was running the affairs of Sri Lanka Cricket in 2011. At the time Hathurusingha was being groomed under Trevor Bayliss to take over as head coach of the national team but his innings was rudely cut short by the De Silva administration, so that six years down the line we are facing the consequences.
The way Bangladesh cricket had been improving since Hathurusingha took charge of them in June 2014 it has been an upward curve and it was not long before the youngest Test nation would start hitting the straps.
For those who have not been following Bangladesh cricket of late the result would have been stunning. But those who had watched Bangladesh’s gradual rise knew that it was coming. It had to come some day for any nation is not going to remain at the bottom rung for long. The day arrived just five months after Bangladesh had recorded their first Test win against England at Dhaka. What Hathurusingha has done to Bangladesh is what Dav Whatmore did to Sri Lanka in 1995 when he took over as head coach. At the time the Sri Lankan team was oozing with exceptional talent but it had no direction. That was provided by Whatmore who fine tuned that side to become world beaters by winning the World Cup in 1996. Since then Sri Lanka cricket has always been on the up and they have excelled in all three formats qualifying for six World Cup finals.
To reflect back on the two-Test series there seems to be a trend that the Sri Lanka team must address. They have a habit of winning the first Test of a series invariably at Galle and then losing the next Test and with it either the series or being held to a draw.
What happened in the series against Bangladesh is that Sri Lanka won handsomely at Galle only to succumb in the second Test at the P Sara Oval which is not a happy hunting ground for them having lost five of the last seven Tests played there.
The win at the P Sara Oval was not only a historic one for Bangladesh who were playing in their 100th Test match, but it was also the home ground of Hathurusingha who spent most of his time playing domestic first-class cricket representing Tamil Union in the Premier trophy tournament. It was the Tamil Union that found Hathurusingha when he was initially playing cricket for Veluwana College Dematagoda before moving to Ananda College where he created an unprecedented record of representing his country before his alma mater when he toured England with the Sri Lanka Schoolboys team in 1986 while Ananda were dilly-dallying to give him a place in their first team.
Hathurusingha knew the Sara Oval pitch like the back of his hand and how it would behave. Having learnt the lessons from the defeat at Galle, it was only a matter of the players applying themselves and putting things right with Hathurusingha’s guidance. In fact it was not only Hathurusingha who was instrumental in Bangladesh’s historic win but also two other Sri Lankans whom he had recruited into the coaching staff - former Sri Lanka Test cricketer Thilan Samaraweera who is their batting coach and fast bowler Mario Villavarayen their trainer.
Bangladesh’s rise is not the least surprising because since the advent of Hathurusingha they have been on the ascendency especially in 50-over cricket where they have recorded consecutive series wins against such formidable ODI teams like Pakistan, India and South Africa and also Zimbabwe and Afghanistan between March 2015 and October 2016 at home and reached a World Cup quarterfinal for the first time in their history.
As for Sri Lanka they will need to go back to the drawing board and reflect what went wrong for them at the P Sara Oval. Vital dropped catches seems to be their bane and it is still continuing despite the fact that Sri Lanka Cricket has hired a fielding coach Nic Pothas from South Africa, a High Performance Manager Simon Willis and Strength and Conditioning Coach Nick Lee – both from England.
Asanka Gurusinha the newly appointed Cricket Manager whilst admitting that Sri Lanka had not fielded well in the series, said: “I don’t think we are one of the worst fielding sides. We dropped a few catches which is bad. Working on little things is important. I am observing what we are doing well and what we are not doing well. Fielding will be one area we will focus a lot before the one-day games with coach Graham Ford. Its skill and a lot of repetition. It’s not the amount of time you do it’s the quality of training you do. We need to improve the intensity and not the time. You can do one hour or half hour. It’s the intensity we have to concentrate on. We will increase our intensity levels in training.”
The current Test squad had nine of the players who figured in Sri Lanka’s 3-0 whitewash of Australia in their last Test series played at home. Missing from the present side are captain Angelo Mathews who is injured, Kaushal Silva, Kusal Perera, Vishwa Fernando, Asitha Fernando and Roshen Silva. Between then and now Sri Lanka won a two-Test series in Zimbabwe 2-0 and was whitewashed 0-3 in South Africa.
So what went wrong against Bangladesh? As one critic jokingly put it across, there was a time when Sri Lankan batsmen thought enough is enough and retired themselves out against Bangladesh, but today they won’t even go if they are given out, they call for a referral. That’s how much the game has changed since Sri Lanka took on Bangladesh in 2001 and now.
Sri Lanka had four centurions in the series compared to Bangladesh’s one and Rangana Herath the stand in captain once again displayed why he is regarded as one of the greatest left-arm spinners in the game when he finished with another rich haul of 16 wickets that made him the most prolific left-arm spinner in Test cricket and also took him past 1,000 first-class wickets, having played a greater part of his career in the shadow of the great Muthiah Muralitharan.
Congrats from Hathuru’s captain and mentor
“My Dear Chandika, WOW is all I can say...and that too at the venue that nurtured you!!
Congratulations. Deservedly it’s a dream come true for you. As for the rest of us including those who shared those inexplicable months of arrogant stupidity of some cricket board officials, the faith Sanga, Mahela and the entire team of that time had in your coaching skills has certainly not been misplaced. Our loss has been Bangladesh’s overwhelming gain indeed!!
I can only reflect on that age old saying that there is no greater leveller than this marvellous game we called cricket......Yes no matter who you are, the game will ALWAYS be above you.
I know you will never forget that.
Warm thoughts and blessings, Skanda
