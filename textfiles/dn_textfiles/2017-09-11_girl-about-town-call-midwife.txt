Girl about town : Call the midwife!

The Duchess of Cambridge, pregnant with her third child, is keen on the idea of a home birth.
Kate previously sought permission from aides for second baby Princess Charlotte to be delivered in Kensington Palace, but decided against it after taking advice.

However, after the births of Prince George and his sister proved to be problem-free, my sources tell me Kate will be on much stronger ground this time.
It would spare Kate the ordeal of facing hundreds of paparazzi, as she had to do straight after leaving the maternity unit with George and Charlotte, and allow her children to meet their sibling in the privacy of their own home.
My well-placed informant says: ‘The Duchess knew it wasn’t possible for her first baby to be born at home, but she asked for a home birth for the second. Officials and doctors thought it too risky. There was concern and in the end she decided against it.’
The Duchess, 35, thought to be less than 12 weeks pregnant, has been suffering extreme morning sickness, as she did with both her other pregnancies. It caused her to miss George’s first day of school last week. If she gets the go-ahead for home birth this time, she will be reverting to Royal tradition. The Queen had her four children at Buckingham Palace, and Queen Victoria was born at Kensington Palace in 1819.
The Cambridge children were born in the Lindo Wing of St Mary’s Hospital, Paddington, where the £5,000-a-night suites have the latest technology and access to St Mary’s next door in the event of an emergency.
The Duchess’s wish for a home birth last time was taken so seriously that the route from Kensington to St Mary’s was timed in case of any scare.
My source adds: ‘The Duke and Duchess decided not to take the risk last time. A similar request with the third baby would be more acceptable.’ A spokesman for the Cambridges declined to comment.
