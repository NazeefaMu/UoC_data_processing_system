A BMW car travelling at high speed veered off the road and plunged into the Diyawanna Oya last Saturday morning.
“The car had crashed into two vehicles on its way from Thalawathugoda to Kimbulawela before plunging into the lake. The occupants in the vehicles were not injured,” Thalangama Police said.
The BMW belongs to a son of a car dealer at Isipathana Mawatha. The owner’s son was apparently driving it at the time of the accident.
The severely damaged car was taken to the Thalangama Police.
“The accident caused heavy traffic jams along the Kimbulawela-Thalawathugoda road,” police said. Thalangama Police are investigating.
Meanwhile, Minister Kabir Hashim in a statement said:My attention has been drawn to reports in web media outlets pertaining to the BMW which veered off the road and plunged into the Diyawanna Oya on Saturday.
“Although the driver of the said car is a relative of mine, he is not associated with my ministry nor is he in my personal staff and he is not in anyway associated with my political work. I will extend my fullest cooperation to the police in carrying out further investigations into this matter,”the Minister said yesterday.
