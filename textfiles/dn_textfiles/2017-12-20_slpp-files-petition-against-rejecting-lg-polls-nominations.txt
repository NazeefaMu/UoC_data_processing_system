SLPP files petition against rejecting LG polls nominations

 
A petition was filed at the Appeals Court by five Sri Lanka Podujana Peremuna (SLPP) candidates against rejecting their Local Government polls nominations for the Maharagama Urban Council, today.
Apart from the nominations of Maharagama Urban Council, Weligama and Panadura Municipal Councils, Badulla, Mahiyangana, Agalawatta Pradeshiya Sabas of the SLPP were rejected on December 14.
SLPP Maharagama Urban Council nomination was rejected due to a lack of female representation, the Elections Commission said.
