CURRENCY  TENSIONS AND  CONTAGION  Part I

There is a high publicity that the rupee has been gravely falling in the foreign exchange market. The currency has depreciated during the year so far by about 12% to around Rs. 170 per US dollar as compared to Rs. 152 at the beginning of the year. Further currency depreciation is expected while some raise concern that the country is on the verge of the economic collapse. The wider publicity is given for the primary, external reason, as usual with a tone of blame, for this sudden fall of the currency as the strengthening of the US dollar globally due to the increase in the US interest rates by the US central bank (the US Fed) and strong economic recovery in the US. The authorities emphasize that this currency problem is confronted by many countries in the world at levels worse than Sri Lanka and show a lukewarm attitude to get the currency under control by using immense policy powers available at their hands.
Some analysts seem to confuse the current currency problem (exchange rate over-shooting) with the currency depreciation seen throughout the past as a normal macroeconomic outcome due to the protracted deficit in the country’s balance of payment and, therefore, propose to resolve this deficit problem in order to control the current problem of heavier currency depreciation. However, the balance of payment deficit is a structural economic problem that has been debated during the past 50 years without an outcome and no solution is seen even in next decade.
Therefore, the country has to find immediate policy options to bring the present level of currency depreciation to its normal trend if we wish to escape an economic catastrophe in the event the current currency tensions develop to a currency crisis, as experienced in many countries in the past, given regional and global links and possible contagion of the current currency tensions.
Direct macroeconomic consequences of currency depreciation even in normal times are well-known. Those are the increase in local currency amounts required for repayment of foreign debt, increase in inflation due to the increase in local currency prices of imports and resulting erosion of living standards of the general public and the loss of competitiveness of exports due to higher local inflation. As usual, governments also are adversely affected by concerns raised by the public and political corners on such consequences. In opposite, exporters are expected to benefit from the increase in export proceeds in local currency if they are able to maintain their trade competitiveness not affected by the higher inflation. In general times, the currency depreciation or under-valued exchange rate is a textbook economic policy to improve the trade balance by encouraging exports and import substitution industries and discouraging imports, provided that exports and imports are highly responsive to exchange rates. However, excessive currency depreciation, if not controlled at the beginning, could disrupt the economies.
Therefore, given the wide literature in economic catastrophes due to currency and financial crises in the world, it is prudent to think of the worst and prepare at least from now onwards. This article is drafted in that spirit in the national interest. The relevant policy-makers can ignore my stance and proposals put forward here without any cost if they believe otherwise as they are the legally authorized on policy-making. In that event, contents in this article will help the general public to understand some of the dark inside of currency problems in countries.
The primary reason for the present currency tensions
The faster outflow of foreign investment to the US in the recent past is the prime reason. This outflow has been caused by two factors that emerged during the past two and half years in the global front.
First, the tightening of the US monetary policy by the US Fed has become faster since December 2016 due to strong recovery of the US economy from the global financial crisis 2007/09 during the past decade as reflected by the fall of unemployment from 10% to 3.9%, increase in economic growth from negative 2.8% to 4.2% (annual projection: 3.1%) and increase in general prices from a price reduction 0.5% to around low inflation of 2% between 2009 and present. The monetary policy tightening is being made primarily in areas. They are the hikes in policy interest rates and absorption of dollar liquidity by the US Fed. Interest rate hike so far is 2% from 0.25% in December 2015 to 2.25% as at September 26. The increase has been 1.75% between December 2016 and now and steady/gradual being seven times increase with 0.25% at each time. According to the forecast of interest rates by the US Fed, further hikes are expected, one more this year and four more next year, until the US policy rate is 3.00-3.5% in 2019/2020 as per projections.
The absorption of liquidity is to remove colossal amount of new dollars printed by the US Fed at interest rates close to zero to facilitate the US economic recovery from the financial crisis. Nearly 3.5 trillion of new dollars were printed during 2007-2016 by purchasing government and private securities (asset purchase) from the market. A part of new dollars was invested by private investors, i.e., investment banks and hedge funds, in developing countries including Sri Lanka to earn higher returns due to higher interest rates mostly more than 10% (as compared to close to zero in the US) prevailing in these countries.
These investments are generally short-term in government securities, equities, bank deposits and short-term loans that can be taken out in few days if necessary. The asset purchase was stopped in 2014 and printed money is being taken out gradually from the economy as and when those assets at the hand of the US Fed mature. The current projection is to remove about a trillion of US dollars whose eventual monetary policy impact would be reduction of the global dollar liquidity by nearly 6 trillion through the normal multiplier effect. When interest rates rise and dollar liquidity falls significantly in the US as compared to other countries, it is natural that money and investments flow back to the US for safer US investments with better returns.
Second, the President Donald Trump has offered a highly protectionist economic policy package, America First, through increase of import tariffs (increase from 10% to 25%), general tax cut (amounting 1.5 trillion with corporate tax reduced from 35% to 11%), new fiscal spending on infrastructure (nearly one trillion) and considerable deregulation. He openly and aggressively invited American firms and investors to come back to the US of the new business friendly economy. This also has prompted huge investment inflows to the US.
As a result of higher demand for and tighter supply of dollars in the US, the value of the dollar being the most popular global reserve currency (nearly 63% of world central bank reserves) naturally increases as against other currencies in the world. This is the story in brief behind the fall of the currencies of many countries. The currencies of countries which are highly exposed to short-term foreign investments confronted adverse falls when such investments started flowing out. India, Indonesia, Philippine and Sri Lanka are in the top of the Asian list. Argentina and Turkey are in the top of the worst list in the world. It is highly possible that the list will expand soon, added with prevailing trade tensions among the US, China, Canada and Europe.
Both monetary policy tightening and the US new economic policy package have been well communicated to the world. The US Fed continuously communicated its monetary policy tightening in its “forward guidance” policy since 2014 and global financial and economic analysts have been providing projections throughout the clock for the US interest rates and possible policy transmission and spillover effects along with past experiences. Therefore, the US monetary policy change was not a secret to policy-makers of developing countries as the global financial and economic media in the internet has been full of the literature. However, as usual, they started opening eyes only after the spillover effects started biting the economies since early this year, especially at the beginning of the currency turmoil in Turkey and Argentina in May-June. Still, some give brave talks as if the present currency problem has no macroeconomic fundamentalsim order for them to be complacent until a currency crisis hit, as usual.
Economic experts led by former US Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke state that, at the cliff of monetary tightening and termination of the additional fiscal stimulus by end of 2020, the US economy will start confronting a severe recession requiring a turn-back of another round of relaxed monetary policy in 2020 as the US economic recovery is still not sustainably strong for such a speedy phase of monetary policy tightening. Therefore, countries like Sri Lanka can expect another silver line from the US and world economy if we survive in next two years.
Currency tensions to currency crises
Exchange rate is a highly speculative price among all those who have economic activities that are linked to foreign exchange. Central banks, currency dealers, international investors, exporters and importers are on the top of the list. Except central banks, all attempt to make profit in their transactions of buying or selling or both of foreign currency. In normal times, various speculations mostly cancel out in aggregate and, therefore, the volatility of the exchange rate stays in unconcerned territory of minds of participants in markets. However, in the event the exchange rate gets in to regional tensions of speculations, it becomes destabilizing, i.e., everybody starts speculating (herd behaviour) in same direction faster and faster, causing the exchange rate to over-shoot.
In the current communication and geo-political systems, it becomes extremely difficult to make it turn-back if the currency tensions become currency crises. A regional currency crisis affects countries disproportionally depending on the economic and financial strengths and the policy proactivity of the respective countries. Any currency crisis within a country not connected to any global or regional tensions is manageable by the country authorities with the support of other countries in the region. Therefore, if a currency gets attacked by regional tensions, the country should think of the worst of a currency crisis and taking prompt action to prevent any contagion of speculation as nobody can forecast a currency or financial crisis and such crises have potential to destroy countries and regional economies as experienced from the Asian financial crisis 1997/98. Further, no support can be expected from friendly countries as they are also in the currency threats. A currency crisis causes widespread shortages of funds in the economy, loan default and bankruptcies. Therefore, we need to fully understand how various important sectors of the economy are linked to or exposed to tensions of currency speculations and crises.
Destabilizing speculation over the depreciation of the currency will cause significant shortage of foreign currency in the country through various sources. First, foreign funds/investments will flow out to safer and competitive countries.
As most foreign investments are in short-term local currency investments, the currency depreciation will result in reduction in their foreign currency capital (foreign currency brought to the country) that can be recovered by selling out local currency investments. They are usually currency arbitrageurs that flow across countries to earn quick gains from interest differentials and movements of currency rates and they have no mercy on our countries other than returns and safety of their funds. Some of these investors have high geo-political links which can destabilise the countries through their investments. Therefore, foreign investors rush to take back their investments as soon as possible as they also start confronting losses and defaults. For example, many high-street European banks started feeling tensions in August on their large exposures to Turkey and Argentina. This is the origin of a currency crisis. Second, citizens such as exporters and foreign remittance receivers will delay their foreign currency receipts with the intension to get more local currency out of foreign currency proceeds when the currency is more depreciated. This will curtail the existing foreign currency inflow to the country on real trade.
Third, importers and others who are to pay to foreigners in the near future, they will try to pay in advance in order to avoid the increase in amount of local currency required for foreign payments in future. Fourth, importers accelerate imports to pile stocks to make abnormal profit in the future. Everybody will try to stock foreign currency outside the banking system. The accumulated result of such currency speculation is the grave shortage of foreign currency liquidity in the banking system. As the foreign currency outflow has to be financed by the reduction in the foreign reserve of the Central Bank who sells foreign currency to the market by buying local currency, the market will confront a grave shortage of local currency liquidity and increase in interest rates unless the Central Bank pumps back new money to the economy through its domestic open market operations (sterilization).
