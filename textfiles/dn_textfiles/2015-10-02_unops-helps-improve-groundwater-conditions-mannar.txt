UNOPS helps improve groundwater conditions in Mannar

The United Nations Office for Project Services (UNOPS), in partnership with the Mannar District Secretariat and the Mannar Urban council, held a series of community consultations in a bid to help communities improve groundwater conditions and increase their resilience to floods related threats.
The result of the consultations has led to joint development of solutions for the problems faced in the district. The residents of Mannar face regular threats of flooding at rainy seasons. The threat of flooding looms high with the high tide levels reaching 0.75 metres, and with the height in some areas of the island being less than 0.75 metres above mean sea level.
The activities are part of a wider effort to upgrade the drainage network and the inland pond systems to contribute to better flood control and increased groundwater recharge. The interventions are set to benefit more than 16,000 people in the Mannar Island. UNOPS is also working with the authorities to demarcate and identify boundary lines of the ponds as those are often unclear and no proper documentation from the past is available. These activities are carried out by UNOPS in collaboration with the local authorities, community based organisations and the local residents.
This participatory approach has allowed the team to help resolve some of the land use issues and reach settlements with most of those who have encroached on the pond areas. Work is in progress to renovate and restore some of the main ponds in the island which will improve the surface water management and groundwater recharge capacity.
