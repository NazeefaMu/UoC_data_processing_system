New building for Aluvihare Maha Vidyalaya

The Education Ministry has taken steps to build a new multi-storeyed classroom building with all facilities at Aluvihare Maha Vidyalaya in Matale.
The move is to reduce congestion in the school.
Agriculture State Minister Wasantha Aluvihare laid the foundation stone recently in this regard. The building is to be completed soon. Rs. 24 million has been allocated for this purpose.
