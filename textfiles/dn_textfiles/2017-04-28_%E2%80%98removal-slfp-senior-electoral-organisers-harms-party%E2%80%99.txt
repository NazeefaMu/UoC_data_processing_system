‘Removal of SLFP senior electoral organisers harms party’

Removal of SLFP senior leaders like Janaka Bandara Tennakoon from electoral organiser posts has caused great harm to the party, former Galewela Pradesheeya Sabha Chairman M.P.R. Jayatilleke said.
He said Pramitha Bandara Tennakoon's resignation from his provincial minister post to condemn the removal of Janaka Bandara Tennakoon should be considered a great decision taken by a son on behalf of his father, .
Jayatilleke said people who voted for 'Swan' at the last presidential election detested the present government today. He said he would rally round these people and take them in 65 buses to participate in the Sri Lanka Podu Jana Peramuna (SLPP) May Day rally at the Galle Face Green.
He said the SLPP would win convincingly at any future election.
