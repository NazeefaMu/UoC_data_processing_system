Fear spots!

Many of us think that chickenpox is just another infectious disease that does not require serious treatment. But certain adults may develop complications when infected with the disease, says Consultant Virologist and the Head of the National Influenza Centre of Medical Research Institute (MRI) Dr. Chrishan Jude Jayamaha (M.B, B.S. PG Dip in Med. Micro., M.D. (Med. Virology)
Q: What is Chickenpox?
A: It is a highly contagious illness characterized by a skin rash caused by a virus called Varicella Zoster. Chickenpox is also called Varicella Infection. It is also known as VZV infection. It is an acute, highly contagious, disease.
In temperate climates most cases occur before the age of 10 years. The epidemiology is less well understood in tropical areas, where a relatively large proportion of adults in some countries are seronegative.
While mostly a mild disorder in childhood, chickenpox tends to be more severe in adults.
It is characterized by an itchy, vesicular rash, usually starting on the scalp and face, initially accompanied by fever and malaise.
As the rash gradually spreads to the trunk and extremities, the first vesicles dry out. It normally takes about seven to 10 days for all crusts to disappear.
Q: How does it spread?
A: By small droplets, aerosol or direct contact or indirectly by touching freshly soiled contaminated items. The incubation period is 14 to 21 days.
The patients are entitled for medical leave and it helps prevent the disease from spreading to healthy persons. Patients are usually contagious from a few days before onset of the rash until the rash has crusted over.
Q: Who are at risk?
A: Pregnant women, newborns, elderly patients and organ transplant patients are at risk. Those whose immune system is weak such as transplant patients and elderly patients may develop complications when get infected with the disease. They can rarely have pneumonia. The disease may be fatal, especially in neonates and immune compromised individuals.
Complications include VZV-induced pneumonitis or encephalitis and invasive group A streptococcal infections. Immune compromised individuals are at particular risk of severe disease.
Q: What is shingles?
A: Following infection, the virus remains dormant (lying in low activity) in neural ganglia; upon subsequent reactivation, VZV may cause zoster (shingles), a disease affecting mainly immune compromised individuals and elderly people.
It is restricted only to a small part of skin unlike widespread rash of chickenpox.
Q: What treatments are available for those infected?
A: Antiviral drugs such as Acyclovir (like antibiotics against bacterial infections) are available. Special treatments are available for high risk patients such as Immunoglobulins.
Q: How can Chickenpox be prevented?
A: Vaccines are available. It is recommended to children and adults. Two doses have to be taken.
It is advisable to children and teenagers as if they get infected they might miss examinations. Chickenpox leaves life long protection against it.
