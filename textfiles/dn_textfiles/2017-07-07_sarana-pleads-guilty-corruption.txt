Fined Rs.3,000:
Former Deputy Minister Sarana Gunawardena yesterday informed the Colombo Chief Magistrate that he was pleading guilty in two corruption cases filed by the Bribery Commission for his failure to declare assets and liabilities for two years.
The Commission to Investigate Allegations of Bribery or Corruption had filed two corruption cases in Colombo Chief Magistrate’s Court against former Deputy Minister Sarana Gunawardena over the non-declaration of assets and liabilities while he was serving as the Chairman of National Lotteries Board between 2006 and 2007. When the cases came up before Colombo Chief Magistrate Lal Banadara, the former Minister pleaded guilty in two cases and police were ordered to obtain his fingerprints in order to ascertain his previous crime records.
The Chief Magistrate fixed the cases for July 20 in order to mete out punishment.
The Bribery Commission alleged that Sarana Gunawardena had failed to declare his assets and liabilities for a period of two years since 2006 to 2007 while he was serving as the National Lotteries Board Chairman.
The Commission to Investigate Allegations of Bribery or Corruption had filed charges against the former Deputy Minister in the Colombo Chief Magistrate’s Court under Section 9 of the Declaration of Assets and Liabilities Law No. 1 of 1975.
President’s Counsel Anil Silva appeared for the accused.
On April 6, 2017, former Defence Ministry Monitoring MP Duminda Silva had pleaded guilty in three corruption cases filed against him by Bribery Commission and he was ordered to pay a fine of Rs.3,000 by the Colombo Chief Magistrate’s Court.
Former Defence Ministry Monitoring MP Duminda Silva who pleaded guilty in three corruption cases filed against him by Bribery Commission was yesterday ordered to pay a fine of Rs.3,000 by Colombo Additional Magistrate Aruni Artigala.
This is the first time in Sri Lanka a Parliamentarian was convicted by a Court over an offence that comes under the Declaration of Assets and Liabilities Law.
The Bribery Commission alleged that the former Parliamentarian had failed to declare his assets and liabilities in accordance with the Declaration of Assets and Liabilities Law No.1 of 1975, for a period of three years 2011, 2013 and 2014.
The Additional Magistrate informed Court that according to Assets and Liabilities Law, the Court has jurisdiction to impose a fine of Rs.1,000 or one year jail term for a person who found guilty to the charges. The Additional Magistrate imposed a fine of Rs.1,000 each on three cases and observed that the accused had purposely ignored to declare his assets and liabilities while being functioning as a Parliamentarian between 2010 and 2015.
