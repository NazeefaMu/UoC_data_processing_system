Day to take on Spieth at Australian OpenGolf | AUS | Day associated with x

Sydney: Former world No.1 Jason Day will battle two-time winner Jordan Spieth at this year’s Australian Open in Sydney, organisers said on Friday.
Australia’s top-rated golfer, now ranked No.9 in the world, will be contesting his national championship for the first time in four years at The Australian course from November 23-26.
Current world No.2 and three-time major winner Spieth is returning to defend the crown he won last year in a play-off.
“The Australian Open holds a special spot in my heart,” Day said”.
“I’d love to get my name on that trophy one day -– hopefully this November.”
His best result at the tournament was tied fourth in 2011.
Day has 14 top-10 finishes in the 28 major championships he has completed, including victory at the 2015 US PGA Championship. He is also a 10-time winner on the US PGA Tour.
The Australian Open winner will receive a minimum of 32 World Golf Ranking points.
