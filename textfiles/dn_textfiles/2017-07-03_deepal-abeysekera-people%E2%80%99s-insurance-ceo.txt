Deepal Abeysekera, People’s Insurance CEO

Former Head of Marketing & Research at People’s Bank, Deepal Abeysekera has been appointed as the CEO of People’s Insurance Limited from July, 2017.
During his 17 year tenure at the state-owned People’s Bank, Abeysekera lead it to amass some of the most prestigious awards in the country.
He was conferred the prestigious Brand Champion of the Year and Brand Leadership Award by the Sri Lanka Institute of Marketing and the World Brand Congress in recognition of his distinctive achievements in strategic business development and brand building in the financial services industry. Using this and the two decades of experience he gained prior to his banking appointment at People’s Bank in the insurance industry, Abeysekera is well positioned to spearhead People’s Insurance Limited, a subsidiary under the umbrella of People’s Leasing & Finance. Lauded for his innovative stance in insurance sales and marketing and for pioneering business development strategy, this aspect of Abeysekera’s experience and expertise will stand him in good stead to lead the Company.
Aptly qualified for a position of this stature given his MBA from the University of Queensland, Abeysekera augments his knowledge and experience by being a Chartered Marketer and Fellow of the Chartered Institute of Marketing UK and Member of both the Chartered Management Institute UK and Institute of Certified Management Accountants. The fact that he has been a Past President of the Association of Professional Bankers Sri Lanka showcases the recognition and reputation he has garnered among both the marketing and financial industry fraternity, which augurs well as he steps into his new role.
The input, leadership and value Abeysekera infuses into People’s Insurance will undoubtedly be of immense advantage to this seven year old company, which in the last financial year ending December 31 2016 saw its annual premiums exceed Rs 4 billion spread over 150,000 insurance policies. Quoted on the Colombo Bourse and backed by two of the largest financial institutions in the country, People’s Leasing & Finance and People’s Bank while being supported by reputed international reinsurers, PIL can use Abeysekera expertise to continue growing the outstanding performance the company has been posting since inception.
