Singha Cement launches  new logo and packaging

Singha Cement, a subsidiary of the second largest cement manufacturer in the world, Heidelberg Cement recently unveiled a new logo and packaging at a ceremony held at the Taj Samudra Hotel, Colombo.
In its capacity as a subsidiary of Heidelberg Cement Group, Singha Cement provides high quality products enriched by the mother company’s extensive research and development and technical expertise.
“Heidelberg Cement is world renowned for its customer orientation, service quality and the culture of continuous improvement. Here in Sri Lanka, Singha Cement operates in the same vein fuelled by our commitment to providing products on par with the highest global standards,” commented Kiran Redkar, Managing Director Singha Cement.
Singha Cement imports extensively ordinary portland cements from the SLSI registered manufactures and distributes those to the market under the brand ‘Singha’. In addition to remaining true to the promise of high quality products, Singha Cement maintains an uninterrupted availability throughout the country via wholesale traders in the market with a single source.
Heidelberg Cement commenced manufacturing in the 18 century when aspiring youth Johann Philipp Schifferdecker purchased a bankrupt mill in Heidelberg for 258,000 gold marks and converted it to a Portland cement factory. The Company (later named Heidelberg Cement) initially employed a mere 35 employees.
Its 159 cement and grinding plants throughout the five continents manufacture 195 million tons of cement annually and own 1,735 ready-mixed concrete production plants and 112 asphalt plants. In addition Heidelberg has aggregate reserves and resources of 20 billion tons.
In Sri Lanka, Singha Cement employs a similar core philosophy.
“In addition to set targets, we also enjoy the highest standard in production, staff management as well as meeting social obligations,” revealed Redkar.
Singha Cement meets the needs of domestic infrastructural developments, industries and residential constructions. It also provides quality products for non-residential markets. ‘Singha’ is sought after by the country’s largest construction, roofing and RMC companies in equal interest.
