[CITIZENS' Mail - (04-07-2017)]

Are there sufficient controls for lotteries?
While at least six or more draws are being conducted on a daily basis, which includes three from each of the Lottery Boards, it is pertinent to draw the attention of those officials responsible, to ascertain whether precautions are adequate to ensure that no malpractices are committed after the show is recorded at the SLRC studio by 7 p.m.
During this time and the actual telecast of the draw that does take place on National TV at 9.30 p.m., in many places in Colombo tickets are being sold beyond 8 p.m. It is in this context that it is pertinent to find out as to what happens to these tickets sold after the draws at 7 p.m.? Are there any winnings or not? If it is so valid then the next question arises as to the integrity of the staff, TV crew, and others accommodated with the draw. It is possible that the winnings could be made known to others outside via the mobile phones. With the intense competition between the two boards going head to head, with one outplaying the other, it is imperative that justice is done by those responsible on behalf of the many thousands who are daily trying their luck, sans any outside information from those involved in the draws. This may be an aspect that may have been overlooked up to now, by those concerned and hence needs corrective action as appropriate.
In the alternative the Boards may ban the sale of tickets by 7 p.m., but how feasible this would depend on the dealers and the management of the boards, as there would be a drop in sales if implemented.
