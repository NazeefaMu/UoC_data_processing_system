Dr. Wiratunga from the School of Computing Science and Digital Media at the Robert Gordon University in Aberdeen, Scotland, addressing the Forum said that Big Data is a popular topic which has gained much attention and is of strategic importance to Robert Gordon University and Scotland.

“What is Business Analytics? Everyone is talking about it these days. It is simply turning data into insight. If you have heard of Netflix, they have a lot of subscribers as well as data. After further investigation into the types of TV shows that subscribers prefer to watch, they found a relationship between specific pairings of TV shows and they went onto produce the American version of House of Cards which was a huge success. Another heavily used example in business analytics is on pampers and beer. A famous supermarket wanted to get an idea of the products customer like to buy together when they shop at the grocery store and they found a very unusual pairing which was pampers and beer. They put these products next to each other and even gave a promotion on these two products together and the sales increased by a vast amount,” Alroy Mascrenghe, said.
Farook said Big Data Analytics is targeted towards a tech savvy, R&D and research oriented architects, solution designers, implementers and engineers.
He added that the MSc Big Data Analytics offered at IIT will provide students following the programme an in-depth knowledge on technologies and tools that will give rise to efficient Big Data Analytics solutions.
