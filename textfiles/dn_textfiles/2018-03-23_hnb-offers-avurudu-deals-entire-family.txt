HNB offers Avurudu deals for entire family

HNB PLC launched its special New Year Savings Campaign for General and Minors’ Savings accounts throughout March and April, with a view to recognizing and rewarding the savings habit among all of its valued customers in celebration of the Sinhala and Tamil New Year season.
Through the new campaign, customers who make deposits between Rs. 25,000/- and Rs. 3 million in their general savings accounts during March and April will be provided with their choice of special gifts from HNB.
Elaborating on the unique features of this season’s New Year Savings campaign HNB Senior Manager- Deposits, Viranga Gamage said, “Our main goal with this year’s ‘campaign is to incentivize savings and make the whole process fun and exciting for the whole family and we are confident that we have really delivered on that promise this New Year season.”
“This year also marks the return of our highly popular gift voucher system, which HNB was first to introduce to the Sri Lankan market in 2016. Together with one of the largest selection of electric, electronic, home appliances and ceramic gifts, we are able to offer our valued customers unmatched value for their savings, and I believe that is what sets HNB ahead of the market,” he noted.
Notably, all HNB gift vouchers for this New Year Campaign can be redeemed at any Abans, Singer, or Damro outlet, providing customers with unprecedented choice this season.
In addition to HNB’s General Savings Campaign, the bank also announced the parallel launch of its popular ‘Minor Savings New Year Campaign’ to reward HNB Singithi customers of all ages during this year’s festive season.
Emphasising the traditional and cultural significance of the Sinhala and Tamil New Year, this year’s Minors’ Savings Campaign will mainly provide Singithi customers with gifts that are themed for the season.
Maintaining an island-wide presence across 251 customer centres, HNB maintains dominant leadership positions across retail, SME, corporate and digital banking including several of Sri Lanka’s most innovative internet and mobile banking services that are designed to usher in a new technology-enabled banking paradigm.
