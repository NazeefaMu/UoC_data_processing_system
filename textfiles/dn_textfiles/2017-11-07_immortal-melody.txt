Immortal  melody


Everybody did not listen to him. Everybody did not love him. But everyone knew him. He was known across this small island, and was much more than Sir Elton John or the like to the Sri Lankans. Which is why his departure left the Sri Lankans speechless although he bade farewell to a well consummated life.
That’s quite the thing about Amaradeva. He was loved by a major portion of this country’s yesteryear generation. He was imitated all the time. Yet he remained inimitable. He triggered controversy, but his character remains above controversy even to this date.
Amaradeva remained a global figure in the country’s national music. He was born when Ceylon was still trapped in the colonial clutches - 1927. It took a heavy toll on the country’s music scene too. Ceylon had to search its originality following the Independence in 1948. Ananda Samarakone established music unique to Sri Lanka, with Sunil Santha who followed him fusing Western and folk music for the first time. This was a period when hardly anyone bothered about Ceylonese original music.
The maestro belonged to the rare calibre of musicians who can express well. His sophisticated expression betrays his somewhat authoritative knowledge of literature as well as bilingualism. In both Sinhala and English, Amaradeva would articulate his thoughts of intellect in a soft cadence. To see him perform with his unique music instrument now and then was familiar in such instances.
When humans reach divinity, they achieve what deities cannot: immortality. Prof. Ediriweera Sarachchandra knew that Wannakuwattavaduge Don Albert Perera would make a timeless journey that will make him immortal in many centuries to come. And thus Albert Perera was baptized as Amaradeva, immortal deity.
Professor Sarachchandra and the then Lankadeepa Editor D B Dhanapala, who detected Amaradeva’s unsurpassable capacity, were instrumental in sponsoring him to further studies in India by setting up a fund. Amaradeva’s baptism took place just before leaving for Bhatkande University, which turned out a touchstone in his life later on.
Ashokamala’s music director Mohamed Ghouse recognised Amaradeva as the best violinist in his orchestra. Sri Lankan cinema’s second talkie Ashokamala is not only Amaradeva’s starting point as a cinema musician, but also as an actor. He could have been the most senior actor alive before the early hours of November 3, since none of the Kadavunu Poronduva (the first talkie) cast is alive today.
If Ananda Samarakone and Sunil Santha could set the platform for a new consciousness in local music, Amaradeva continued the process. His early music compositions were influenced largely by Ananda Samarakone. This influence was very much useful when Amaradeva joined the Radio Ceylon in the 1960s to moderate a number of innovative programs.
Young Amaradeva met Sunil Santha at one of the legendary vocalist’s concerts. That acquaintance led Amaradeva to Chitrasena studios. And that brief encounter was to have a lasting impact on Sinhala culture.
Amaradeva was not confined to oriental forms. He tried his hands on Western harmonies and counterharmonies and at times he fused it with oriental music forms. His voice has that powerful capacity to breathe life into poetry. Celebrated poems like Ma Mala Pasu and Sinidu Sudu Muthu flourish with life familiar in our realms, when Amaradeva sings in his exceptional voice. Poets such as Mahagama Sekara, Madawala S. Rathnayaka and Sri Chandraratne Manawasinghe could get the best of him.
Had he been with us, Amaradeva would have entered his ninth decade next month. He caused the flourishing rains to fall in this land which was left parched. May there be more rains in this land so that we would miss the legend less.
