Arrest warrant on SLPP Walallawita PS Chairman

The Colombo High Court yesterday issued warrant on the arrest of Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna Walallawita Pradeshiya Sabha Chairman Udeni Athukorala for not being present in Court in connection with a case filed against him by Bribery Commission.
The Pradeshiya Sabha Chairman was not present in court over a case filed against him for allegedly accepting a bribe of one million rupees from former Bentara Pradeshiya Sabha chairman in exchange for issuing a permit to transport sand in 2013.
Accordingly, High Court Judge Vikum Kaluarachchi issued warrant for the arrest of accused and sureties were ordered to appear in court on August 8.
The Director General of Commission to Investigate Allegations of Bribery or Corruption had filed indictments against the Pradeshiya Sabha Chairman on 13 charges under the Bribery Commission Act and listed twelve persons including former Bentara Pradeshiya Sabha chairman as witnesses.
The detectives of the Commission to Investigate Allegations of Bribery or Corruption had arrested the accused on June 12, 2013 on charges of soliciting a bribe of Rs. 1.5 million and accepting another one million rupees from the former chairman of the Bentara Pradeshiya Sabha in exchange for issuing a permit to transport sand.
The arrest was made by detectives of the Commission to Investigate Allegations of Bribery or Corruption following a complaint lodged by former Bentara Pradeshiya Sabha chairman Krishantha Sirimanna.
