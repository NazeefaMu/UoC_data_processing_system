Teacher shortage affects provincial education very much: NCP CM

Lack of teachers affects provincial education very much. I am doing my best to provide a permanent solution to this shortcoming. When I was appointed NCP Chief Minister, the province lacked over 5,000 teachers. I recruited 1,800 teachers. A member objected my action and even filed a case against me, North Central Province (NCP) Chief Minister Peshala Jayaratne Bandara said.
He was addressing the gathering after opening a new building for the Kekiwara, Galkiriyagama Primary School constructed at a cost of Rs. 5 million.
The Chief Minister said he was not feared of mudslinging, lawsuits and newspaper criticism. He said he performs his duties towards the people at any cost. The Chief Minister said a solution was not provided in the past to the teacher shortage in the NCP where 300,000 students from poor farmer families seek education.
He said President Maithripala Sirisena took steps to allocate Rs. 7,000 million recently to develop the provincial education.
"The Principal of the Galkiriyama Primary School carried out a commendable service by completing development work worth Rs 3 million with Rs. 5 lakh that PC granted to the school under 'Pasan Thakshilawa' programme," he said.
