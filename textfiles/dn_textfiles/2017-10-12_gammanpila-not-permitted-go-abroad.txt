Gammanpila not permitted to go abroad

The Attorney General yesterday opposed Pivithuru Hela Urumaya (PHU) leader MP Udaya Gammanpila’s request that he be allowed to travel to Italy from October 17 to November 4 to attend a function.
MP Gammanpila whose passport was impounded by Court for his Rs. 20 million alleged fraudulent share transaction, sought Colombo High Court’s permission to temporarily lift his travel ban.
Deputy Solicitor General Dilan Ratnayake appearing for the Attorney General informed Colombo High Court Judge R. Gurusinghe that Gammanpila’s request cannot be considered at this moment since court was unable to conclude recording evidence from Australian businessman Brian Shaddick, the key witness in this case.
“It would be unfair to the aggrieved party, if court allowed the accused to go abroad without concluding his evidence, who has travelled all the way from Australia,” Ratnayake said.
The High Court is to consider MP Gammanpila’s request on the next trial date.
Australian businessman Brian Shaddick, 74, the first witness in the alleged financial fraud case is to be further cross-examined on October 17.
The Attorney General (AG) alleged that MP Udaya Gammanpila has misappropriated Rs. 20 million when selling the shares of Digital Nominees to businessman Dhammika Perera.
The AG further charged that the alleged business transaction had taken place using a fraudulent power of attorney to sell the shares belonging to Australian businessman Brian Shaddick. The AG has listed 20 persons as witnesses in the case and named 16 documents as production items of the case. MP Gammanpila was arrested in this regard on June 18, 2016. He is currently out on bail.
Deputy Solicitor General Dilan Ratnayake, with Senior State Counsel Nayana Seneviratne appeared for the Attorney General.
President’s Counsel Shavindra Fernando with Jayantha Weerasinghe PC appeared for MP Gammanpila.
