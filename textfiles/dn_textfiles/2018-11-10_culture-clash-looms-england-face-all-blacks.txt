Culture clash looms as England face All Blacks

London, Friday: "Styles make fights" is usually the talk of boxing promoters but it could prove true of England's long-awaited clash against world champions New Zealand at Twickenham on Saturday.
England coach Eddie Jones has often insisted that trying to play the All Blacks at their own running from deep, passing game is a recipe for defeat, with the Australian championing the traditional Red Rose strengths of a powerful forward pack and solid set piece.
And All Blacks coach Steve Hansen accepted there was more than one way to win a game.
"Southern hemisphere rugby -- there's a lot of talk about Super Rugby, it's very free-flowing with a lot lot of tries scored, but in this part of the world, maybe because the environment is different, the weather is different, there is a necessity to play a tighter game," said Hansen.
"I'm certainly not bragging about it," added the former Wales boss.
"We have natural athletes who want to run and carry the ball and pass the ball."
The experienced Jones also knows the virtues of adaptability.
It was a trait England, then coached by Stuart Lancaster, showed in the last of just their seven wins over the All Blacks six years ago when, leading 12-0 at the break courtesy of four Owen Farrell penalties, they ran in three second-half tries through Brad Barritt, Chris Ashton and Manu Tuilagi in a 38-21 triumph.
Dashing wing Ashton is now set to make his first Test start in four years but the injury-prone Tuilagi's long wait for an England recall has been delayed again by a groin problem.
'Farrell doesn't play in a dinner suit'
Fly-half Farrell has found himself in the spotlight after escaping any action for a seemingly illegal shoulder charge in the closing stages of an unconvincing 12-11 win over South Africa at Twickenham last weekend with which England launched their November campaign. But former Wallaby and Japan boss Jones insisted Farrell required the kind of protection referees routinely afforded by match officials to Ireland No 10 Jonathan Sexton. "If he was Sexton then we'd be able to complain about him, but because he's Owen Farrell he's allowed to be hit late," said Jones. He's tough so he gets up and he plays.
"He's a tough rooster, a warrior. He puts his body on the line, he doesn't play in a dinner suit."
Ashton, 31, who came off the bench against the Springboks, has scored 19 tries in a 40-cap England career interrupted by suspensions and spending a season with French giants Toulon. AFP
