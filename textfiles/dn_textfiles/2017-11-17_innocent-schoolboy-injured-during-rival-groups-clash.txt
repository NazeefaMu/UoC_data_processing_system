Innocent schoolboy injured during rival groups clash

A grade six pupil was hit by a stone thrown during a clash between two groups of pupils of a government school in Minipe, where his forehead was injured by the stone that was thrown.
Eleven-year-old S. P. Akisha Irushan attending the Gamini Dissanayaka Model School of Pallevaththa, Minipe was going to wash his hands after having a meal at the school, not knowing that there was a clash going on between two groups.
“First, I didn’t understand what had hit me, but after a while I came to know what has been happening,” the child said.
“When I went to the school upon hearing that my child was sick, I saw he was bleeding from a gash in his forehead and I accompanied him to hospital,” his father said.
A member of the family at the Paalam Handiya, Veraganthota, Minipe, said that the victim is currently back at home after having a one day treatment at the divisional hospital of Hasalaka, Minipe, after being admitted on last Tuesday (14) noon.
The principal, N. W. Wishwakeerthi, is inquiring into the incident occurred during the school interval.
