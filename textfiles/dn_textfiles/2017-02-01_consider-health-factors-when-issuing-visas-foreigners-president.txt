Consider health factors when issuing visas for foreigners: President

Health factors in connection with rules and regulations on issuing visa for foreigners visiting Sri Lanka should be further strengthened considering the risks it poses to the country’s health sector and to protect Sri Lankans from diseases, President Maithripala Sirisena said.
“We have already won many challenges in the health sector. But more challenges emerge with climate change, social change and development,” the President said addressing the gathering after opening the new National Dental Teaching Hospital in Colombo yesterday.
President Sirisena said people visiting the island for various purposes, pose a major threat to the country’s health sector.
“A large number of foreigners arrive in Sri Lanka for various reasons. They stay here for short or long duration. This poses a major threat to the health of the country. It is also a threat to the illicit drug eradication programme. The Health Ministry and the government should give priority to solve this issue,” he said.
“The people, state institutions and others should support to control dengue in the country. I will hold a discussion with the Health Minister and formulate a better plan next week to control dengue,” he said.
“Active participation of both state and private sectors will be sought to control dengue,” the President said.
He said the Colombo National Hospital Heart Unit needs urgent uplift and expansion.
“New hospitals and development projects at hospitals are to be opened in Hambantota, Nuwara Eliya, Teldeniya, Warakapola, Galgamuwa, Kalawanchikudi etc. We have only 50 percent of the total requirement of consultant doctors,” the President added.
