State-of-the-art clubhouse for Army Golf Course

The re-laid Diyatalawa Army Golf Course was gifted with a state-of-the-art clubhouse on June 30, marking its exposure to both global and local golfers alike.
Initiated by the Sri Lanka Army Golf Committee (SLAGC) chaired by Brigadier Nanda Hathurusinghe, the clubhouse was made a reality owing to Army Commander Lieutenant General Mahesh Senanayake’s support.
The re-laying of the golf course as well as the construction of the clubhouse, which took three months to reach completion, had cost about Rs. 5 million.
Air Force Commander Air Marshal Kapila Jayampathy, Major General Seevali Wanigasekara (Rtd), Major General Srinath Rajapaksha (Rtd), Security Forces - Central (SFHQ-Cen) Commander Major General Rukmal Dias, Army Headquarters Master General Ordnance Major General Jagath Gunawardane, Engineer Brigade Commander Major General Jagath Rathnayake, Army, Navy and Air Force senior officers and invitees attended the event.
