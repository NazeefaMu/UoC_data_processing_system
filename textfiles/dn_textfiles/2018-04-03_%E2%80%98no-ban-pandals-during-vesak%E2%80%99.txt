‘No ban on pandals  during Vesak’

During an interview with the Daily News in Kurunegala, yesterday, Buddhasana Minister Gamini Jayawickrama Perera said he had not imposed a ban on pandals during this year’s Vesak festival.
“I only requested youth to refrain from using unnecessary decorations and instead, to take part in proper religious practices. No minister could impose such a ban sans Cabinet approval. However, certain newspapers had misinterpreted what I said,” he added.
