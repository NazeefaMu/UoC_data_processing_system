Ravi forced to resign for fear of possible split in govt: Vasu

Minister Ravi Karunanayake was forced to resign for fear of a possible split in the government, Parliamentarian Vasudeva Nanayakkara said.
“If a no confidence motion had been brought by the Joint Opposition, the UNP and the SLFP would have split. It would have put the government in turmoil. It is to avoid this that they had begged Ravi to resign,” he said.
Nanayakkara was addressing the media at the N.M Perera memorial hall.
He said the government had entered into a deal with Karunanayake. “Government members told him that they could not protect him if the government collapsed. He would be looked after like Thilak Marapana,” he said.
