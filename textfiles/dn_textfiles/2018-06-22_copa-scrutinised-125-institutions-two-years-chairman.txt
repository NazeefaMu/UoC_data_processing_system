COPA scrutinised 125 institutions in two years - Chairman

The people should not misinterpret that financial management and the performance of public institutions is poor under this government based on revelations through the Committee on Public Accounts (COPA) reports.
COPA Chairman and Finance and Mass Media Deputy Minister Lasantha Alagiyawanna said the flaws of public institutions under previous governments had been investigated flippantly and not in a very professional manner.
He said that only 400 institutions had been brought before the COPA from 1978 to 2015. In the last two years 125 institutions have been probed since then."Nearly one third of the COPA workload of 37 years under different governments had been done by the COPA during the last two and half years,” Minister Alagiyawanna said.
He made these observations during a press conference held at the Committee Room number 6 in Parliament complex.
Alagiyawanna said the service accomplished by the COPA since 1978 is so poor due to practical reasons. He added that there were only 26 members in the COPA whereas there are 837 public institutions including 51 Ministries, 92 departments, 19 Government Special Spending Units, 25 district secretariats, 9 Provincial Council Funds, 45 Provincial Ministries, 215 Provincial Councial Special Spending Units and Departments, 46 Provincial Council Authorities, 23 Municipal Councils, 41 Urban Councils and 271 Pradeshiya Sabhas to be assessed annually.
“However from 1978 to 1988 only 108 public institutions had been scrutinised while from 1983 to 1993, 50 institutions had been scrutinised,” Minister Alagiyawanna said. "Only one public institution had been scrutinised during the ten years from 1994 to 2004 and from 2004 to 2010 one another public institution had been scrutinised."
He said finding fault in public institutions based on the COPA reports is irrational.
However, since 2015, the COPA sought for a mechanism to face the challenge of bringing the public institutions before the COPA. Finally a questionnaire was proposed to be forwarded to all institutions.
The answers would be assessed by the Auditor General by visiting the respective institutions and later presented under a report to Parliament. “This mechanism was implemented after the government came to power.” Deputy Minister Alagiyawanna said.
“It was successful. But just by doing these assessments no justice is met by the people in the country. So we think is that if we can prevent the recurrence of these flaws, was an achievement.”
He added that the report prepared on a questionnaire was earlier tabled in Parliament. He said that due to this assessment, there seems a great improvement. In 2015, there were 104 public institutions that obtained less than 50 marks while it dropped to 50 percent in 2016. He added that there were only 282 institutions that obtained marks between 80 and 90 in 2016 and same increased to 447. He also added that the institutions that earned above 90 marks were 60 in number in 2016 and it increased to 73 the next year.
Deputy Minister Alagiyawanna further said that due to the new measures taken by the government, even the public could make complaints to COPA by browsing the www.parliament.lk website.
COPA member JVP Parliamentarian Nihal Galappatti also spoke.
