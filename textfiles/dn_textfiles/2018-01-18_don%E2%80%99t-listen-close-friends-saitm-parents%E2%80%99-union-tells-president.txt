Don’t listen to close friends, SAITM parents’ union tells President

All Presidents should be careful about their very close friends and not distant enemies. It is the same for the current President when it comes to solving the SAITM issue, SAITM Medical Student’ Parents’ Union Chairman Gemunu Wijeratne said.
Addressing a press conference held at the Organization of Professionals’ Associations auditorium in Colombo on Tuesday, he said that the union appeals to the President not to listen to his close friends because their sole objective is achieving private targets.
According to Wijeratne, the parents of SAITM students will never leave anyone alive if the students destroy their lives because of the SAITM issue<U+200B> which has dragged on for years<U+200B>.
All parties had agreed to accommodate all qualified SAITM students at <U+200B>Kotelawala <U+200B>D<U+200B>efence <U+200B>University<U+200B> <U+200B>(KDU), <U+200B>but Deputy Minister Dr. Harsha De Silva stated that there isn’t adequate space at KDU even without discussing the matter with KDU authorities, he added.
