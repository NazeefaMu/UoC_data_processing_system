Karunaratne propels BMS, Sri Lanka into the finals

Business Management School (BMS), Sri Lanka emerged victorious in a last-ball finish against University of Sydney, Australia.
The hosts’ hero was 21-year-old seam-bowling all rounder Chamika Karunaratne, who after having hit a valuable 33 off 29 balls, delivered an accurate final over, conceding only nine runs when Australia needed 14 to win. The final delivery – a perfect yorker – sparked jubilation on the field,
University of, Sydney needed four off that final delivery to score the 164 that would have seen them progress to the final. It was a dot ball. At one stage it seemed like Sydney’s chase had been halted by Sri Lankas disciplined seamers.
Though opener Hayden Kerr had struck 54 off 27 balls, the remaining top order batsmen failed to find the boundary, as the Sri Lankan bowlers delivered a succession of tight overs.
They had needed 67 runs off the last 36 balls, before Will Lawrence and Joseph Kershaw started hitting out. Even their rapid 48-run stand could not get Sydney across the line,
However. Sri Lanka themselves had been in trouble in their innings, with the first four wickets falling for a mere14 runs. Karunaratne put together a 54-run stand with Supeshala Jayathilake, who went on to top-score with 50 off 41 balls. Tilaksha Sumanasiri also hit 40 not out off 22 balls as Sri Lanka reached 163 for 6 in their 20 overs.
