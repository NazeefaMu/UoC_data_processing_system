Battaramulle Seelaratana Thera’s writ petition fixed for support

The Court of Appeal has held that a writ petition filed by Ven. Battaramulle Seelaratana Thera seeking an order preventing the authorities from taking further steps in the procurement process relating to the development of a 300 MW combined cycle power plant at Kerawalapitiya, cannot be dismissed in limine.
Court of Appeal President L.T.B. Dehideniya fixed the matter for support for notice.
President’s Counsel Rumesh de Silva with counsel Harith de Mel and S.V. Niles instructed by D. Vidanapathirana appearing for the 30th respondent raised a preliminary objection that the application cannot be maintained on the basis that the prayers to the petition are not maintainable.
However, counsel Pradeep Kumarasinghe appearing for the petitioner submitted that he is not proceeding with the prayers (h), (i) and G) where the petitioner was seeking for injunctions and enjoining order, but he will be proceeding with the other prayers.
The petitioner stated that the Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) has invited interested local and foreign companies to submit proposals for the project. “Initially over 30 companies had obtained the request for proposal from the CEB. However, only eight bidders have submitted proposal when the deadline for submissions expired on April 21, 2017,” the petitioner said.
The petitioner said among over 30 interested parties, only eight bidders submitted proposals which would minimise competitiveness for an enormous project.
The petitioner said the CEB as the procurement entity has personal interest in the procurement process that will have a huge impact on the transparency of the procurement procedure.
The petitioner cited the CEB, members of National Procurement Commission, the Power and Renewable Energy Minister and several others as respondents.
The petition was filed through counsel Pradeep Kumarasinghe under the instructions of Pradeep Associates.
