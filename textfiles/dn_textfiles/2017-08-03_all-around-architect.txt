An all-around  architect

Wisdom and Knowledge are two attributes it takes to become a competent architect. This is what the Moratuwa University Department of Architecture inculcates in its students. ArchWorld speaks to Dr. Shaleeni Coorey about advice given to students and going beyond the books to create an all- around Architect.
“A degree anyone can have, but honesty, integrity, sincerity - these qualities you can’t achieve through a degree. It matters to be “humane”, and to be so you have to go beyond the books. I think it is very important to respect other professions. You can’t think you know everything. You need to understand and be able to listen and respect the opinions of others. Whatever job one does, it’s a service to another and needs to be respected and appreciated. Honesty is very important. If you can couple these qualities with your qualifications then I think you have won the day,” elucidated Dr. Coorey.
More than listening
Architecture is more than listening to the client and creating spaces they want.
“The client is your first meeting point. Then there is the site and the brief and the design process evolves. Quite often you have to educate the client. That is the key word, because sometimes clients do not know what they really want and in your conversation with them you try and understand what their real requirements are and help them realize their needs and wants. It is a combination of clients’ requirements and the Architects interpretation of it through design. It is not that you merely get everything from the client and produce exactly what they want. That is not good architecture,” said Dr. Coorey
Feasibility also matters, often clients have a cost estimate.
“I think it is important to teach students to foresee the future of their projects. You can’t just design for the ‘now situation’. You need to look at the future.
The building will last 20 years or more. If you take a house at the moment it would be a couple with kids.
Eventually kids move out. How will you manage a house then? Can you separate it in such a way that you can rent out one portion? That is where educating the client comes into play, to discuss with them how they see their future, and how to sustain them. The client should be happy not only with what you produce for them now, but also with how the house will grow and adapt with time,” stated Dr. Coorey
Even in other typologies of buildings all of this definitely matters. But those are only some aspects.
“Then there are the essence of space, spatial experience, spatial qualities, materials and textures and how the building and spaces will behave and respond to the environment, all that relates to the design aspect. Then comes the construction aspect and then it is not just the client and architect. There are so many stakeholders involved – contractors and engineers. The architect has to manage and synchronize the design and construction and all the stakeholders involved, which involves – creative, design, technical, social and managerial skills. That is the tough part. You are not looking at the design and building process from one angle but be able to see it from all directions. It is multi-faceted.
Required skills
Soft skills such as the ability to communicate and to be sensitive and be a good team player are important. The technical knowledge and skills are also important. Project management also plays a major role as cost, quality and time is crucial in the building industry. One also needs to understand and respond to the society and the environment that he is building in. The degree course looks into all these aspects of the design and the building construction process. Such skills are important and require one to go beyond the books in the learning and teaching of Architecture,” explained Dr. Coorey.
Your ability to communicate is important whether it be in English or Sinhala.
“Besides the language, communication itself is an important skill. I think you can separate communication and language and there is a fine line between the two. Proficiency in language will help you communicate better, but logical thinking and presentation and the ability to make sense to people, the ability to prioritize and the systematic flow of information when presenting your design is important.
All that is part of communication. Students go through this process every time they present their designs. It is the skill of justifying what they have done and the ability to know the reasoning behind their creations – the forces in their design thinking. You should be able to explain that. That is where the communication comes in,” pointed out Dr. Cooray.
At University of Moratuwa the B.Arch Degree Course is conducted in English, so Lecturers must encourage students to speak in English and present their work in English. Obviously English is a plus point for their language and communication skills.
“Faculty of Architecture offers several options for students such as –integrated design department which offers fashion & lifestyle design, media and communication, product design , and Department of architecture offers Landscape Architecture and Architecture – which are all creative subjects for those students who are interested. Of course there are many more undergraduate, post graduate and short courses offered by the Department of Architecture, such as Building Economics and Town and Country Planning at the Faculty of Architecture. There are also other schools of Architecture in Sri Lanka. In the Architecture course creative, technical, professional and soft skills are all combined. In every batch we have had about 50 students and above,” informed Dr. Coorey.
Theory and practice
When it comes to student intake there are many criteria and requirements.
“There is of course the Z -Score a UGC eligibility criteria and then we have the aptitude test. That is where the creative skills and also their intellectual skills are tested. So they have to qualify in the aptitude test as well,” added Dr. Coorey.
Along with the theory subjects there is also the studio work and industrial training that helps to bridge the gap between theory and practice.
“The theory subjects and knowledge is the foundation for the practical skills and knowledge gained through studio and industrial training or internship. Learning is not just subject matter but a way of thinking and mastering the thinking process.
The subjects at the university are not only meant to equip them with knowledge, but also inspire in them and cultivate in them the interest to learn and search for new knowledge where the degree is only a beginning to their lifelong learning.
A student must make the best of this opportunity and thrive in this learning ground, but always remember as a student and then as a professional never to lose the “human touch” – “honesty, integrity and respect for all other living beings and the environment,” summed up Dr. Coorey.
