Ratnapura resident writes to Governor about compensation ‘fraud’

A resident of Ratnapura has written to the Governor of the Sabaragamuwa Province stating that a development officer has usurped her of compensation of Rs 1.6 million awarded to her by the government for her house that was damaged by the landslides in May 2017.
On May 26, 2017, her house was destroyed by the heavy rains, and the Divisional Secretariat had awarded her a compensation of Rs 1.6 million. In her letter, she stated that a development officer had handed over a half-built run-down house to her, and written the cheque due to her in the officer’s name. Further, she had taken Rs. 100,000 from her to hand over the deed to the land on which the house was built.
During that time, her husband was not at home and since he did not have a permanent job, she had to take a loan of Rs. 100,000.
As a result of having to repay it with interest, the education of her children has been affected. She has asked that the Governor look into her problem and provide her with a speedy solution.
