India’s dream run to be no. 1 – Sri Lanka is where it all began

‘We play a brand of cricket to be ruthless and to win at all costs - Shastri:
Two years ago is where it all began for India in Sri Lanka when they arrived as the seventh ranked Test team in the world and after losing the first Test at Galle recovered to win the next two Tests and with it the series 2-1. Virat Kohli by then had taken over the reins from MS Dhoni and was making his debut series as captain. That turnaround proved to be the platform for India to reel off six consecutive Test series wins against South Africa, West Indies, New Zealand, England, Bangladesh and Australia and today be ranked as the number one Test side in the world.
Kohli’s team has arrived in Sri Lanka not just for three Tests as was the case in 2015 but for a full gamut of 3 Tests, 5 ODIs and a one-off T20I.
Explaining the transformation that took place Kohli said, “We still remember for us as a squad after the tour of Australia in 2014-15 that we found ourselves being no. 7 in the world. From then on the transformation started this particular series in Sri Lanka gave us belief after being 1-0 down. What it taught us was to come together and come closer as a team and understand our strengths and weaknesses and be defining the rules that we play in Test cricket and take the team higher in the rankings.
“Within 12 or 14 months from then we were the no. 1 side already in the world, we just touched it and then onwards we have solidified it. I still believe in the team and everyone in the team believes and knows that this is where it all started for us. Losing the Test in Galle was quite a dent for us mentally. The way the team came together was iconic as far as the last two years are concerned,” said Kohli at the media conference held at Movenpick Hotel yesterday.
Respect the opposition
At the start of a new series we see the roles have changed and that Sri Lanka are now ranked no. 7 and India are no. 1. But even though Sri Lanka are not the side they once were Kohli said they would not take any team lightly.
“We pay equal respect to any opposition because you can be a strong or weak side but the game is the same, you still have to bat and bowl. You have to earn your victories. I do feel if you want to win a series in any country in the world you have to play good cricket and have to work very hard for it for which we are ready to do.”
Like Sri Lanka at present India were at the time going through a transition period and explaining how they came out of it Kohli said, “When we started our plans to make a comeback in Test cricket the very first thing we spoke about when we played Sri Lanka was the difference in experience in Test matches between the two sides which was vast. Sanga (Sangakkara) was still playing and Angelo (Mathews) was in the side as well so was Rangana Herath and Dhammika Prasad and all these guys. The team was not even closer by the number of Test matches but what we told everyone in the group was what matters is how much you believe more than the opposition.
“You might have played 100 games but if a guy who has played 10 games has more belief than him he is going to end up doing well on the field. This game gives rewards to people who are brave and who are willing to do the hard yards. It is something we have certainly accepted as a team and worked towards. Transition initially can take a few months but after that it’s all about mentally how much you feel you are ready to be at that level and all that counts,” Kohli said.
What has made India tick as the no. 1 Test team is the professionalism they display at every level.
“You have to respect the game and you have to take care of the fitness levels, be professional in practice, and be professional in the way you prepare for a Test match. You can’t just turn up for a Test match thinking we’ll see how it goes,” said Kohli.
“There’s a lot of preparation, visualisation and hard work that goes into starting off one Test, a series or two. This team takes equal onus of that and the responsibility and that is the only way you can get results. If the players feel they are responsible for what goes on in the field that’s when the professionalism comes out and people start preparing in the background, not many people see but that’s what counts.”
Keeping in mind Sri Lanka’s track record at home they beat the no. 1 ranked Australia side last year, Kohli said, “Sri Lanka is very strong at home and that is something we are aware of and it is something we will always keep in our minds throughout this tour.”
Fond memories of Sri Lanka
Ravi Shastri the newly appointed Indian coach said that his role was to get the players in the frame of mind so as to go out express themselves on the field.
“We want the guys to out there and express themselves and play a brand of cricket that’s ruthless, where you play to win at all costs. No compromise on that,” said Shastri. “If you look at Sri Lanka’s track record playing at home is as good as any side in world cricket right upto the best. As an Indian team we are not going to take them lightly, we will not take things for granted. We like to be consistent so that we keep our no. 1 position in place and above all we look to improve. If we don’t look to improve there is no point playing. You’ve got to try and raise the bar. “
Shastri who is no stranger to Sri Lanka said, “The first stamp on my passport was Sri Lanka when as an 18 year old I came as an under 19 player, my first stint as a broadcaster was also in Sri Lanka in 1994 and now my first stint as a coach also happens to be in Sri Lanka. Obviously there is some connection. It’s such a fabulous island with great people and fond memories for me.”
Sri Lanka’s one-day captain Upul Tharanga who was present on behalf of Test skipper Dinesh Chandimal who was down with a viral ’flu said that the Indian series gave Sri Lanka an opportunity to express themselves against the world’s no. 1 ranked side.
“The Test win against Zimbabwe has given the players a lot of confidence to face India. We know what we should do when we are playing such a strong side as India. We know the challenges that are ahead of us and we are preparing for it with our coach Nic (Pothas),” said Tharanga.
India open their tour with a two-day warm-up game against a Sri Lanka Cricket President’s beginning at the CCC grounds from today before moving into the three-Test series at Galle from July 26.
