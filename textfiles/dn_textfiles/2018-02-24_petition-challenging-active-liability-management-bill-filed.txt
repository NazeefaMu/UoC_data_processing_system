A Special Determination petition challenging the Bill titled “Active Liability Management” was filed before the Supreme Court by Colombo District Parliamentarian Bandula Gunawardena yesterday.

directly and indirectly suspend or make inoperative the provisions of the Constitution, particularly Articles 3, 4(d), 12(1) and 148, 149 and 150.

The Bill is in conflict with the provisions of the Fiscal Management (Responsibility) Act, No. 3 of 2003,he said.This special determination petition was filed through senior counsel Kanishka Vitharana and counsel H.M.Tillekaratne.
