Thuruliya Wenuwen Api launched

The Thuruliya Wenuwen Api project was launched on Thursday (23) by the Sri Lanka Army and the 'Derana' Media Network and tree saplings were planted along either side of the 154-long Kadawatha-Matara Highway.
The inaugural phase was coordinated and implemented by the Security Force Headquarters - West (SFHQ-West) on the guidelines given by Army Commander Lieutenant General Mahesh Senanayake. The first saplings were planted on sideways of the Athurugiriya entrance by the chief guest. The Department of Agriculture provided the saplings along with the Army Directorate of Agriculture and Livestock.
The project will continue afterwards from Kadawatha to Matara. Over 25,000 saplings will be planted under the programme.
