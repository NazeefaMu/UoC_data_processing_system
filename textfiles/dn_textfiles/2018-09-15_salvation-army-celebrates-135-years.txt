Salvation Army celebrates 135 years

The Salvation Army Sri Lanka (SASL) celebrated its 135 years of service, at Galadari Hotel, Colombo, recently.
The celebration was marked by the launch of the ‘Public Annual Report 2017’ for Sri Lanka.
The release was significant in view of the 14 decades of service by the organisation, committed to transforming the lives of Sri Lankans who live in extreme poverty and are victims of injustice and discrimination.
The report titled ‘Answering the Call’, depicts the tale of how the Salvation Army journeyed and developed in the country. The aim of the Salvation Army is to ensure that all communities live together in harmony, enjoying a better and brighter future.
The International Salvation Army was founded in 1865 by the then Methodist Minister William Booth, having experienced the despicable plight of slum dwellers in East London.
The Organisation now serves in about 130 countries. The projects in Sri Lanka include the provision of large-scale safe water wells. More than 15,000 people now enjoy safe water facilities with community wells built by the Salvation Army. The SASL has built about seven wells for the rural poor.
The projects also include nutrition programmes in eight districts; long-standing residential care for mothers and babies, children, and elders as well as island-wide hostel accommodation services for young employed and differently- abled people.
The Army Medical Services also conducted mobile medical clinics, assisted by local medical practitioners and health officers.
