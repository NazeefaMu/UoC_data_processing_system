Dollar strengthened due to US economic resurgence: JSS

The Jathika Sevaka Sangamaya (JSS) Vice President and Media Spokesman Sunil de Silva said yesterday, that the Dollar had strengthened due to economic resurgences in the United States, while this had become a problem to currencies of Germany, China and India and many other countries.
Therefore, we should have a proper method to direct our economy in the proper manner. Even though many political opposites are saying that the rupees’ depreciation against the dollar has caused severe economic problems, not even economic experts had provided a proper solution to the matter.
However, a rupee had devalued only by 2 percent last year. But during the former regime, a rupee had depreciated by 110 percent in 2011, 127 percent in 2012 and 130 percent in 2014.
He further said a rupee was forcibly held during the former regime. But, after this government came into power, it was allowed to float.
This generally led to the depreciation of a rupee. Although a rupee depreciation is not affected to local trade, we have to spend more to import goods. The only solution to this problem is moving towards the export oriented trade and re-export sector. We should not only increase agricultural production, but also enhance the service sector.
JSS Chief Organiser Suranga Naullage, said the country should move towards a production based economy. In 2012, former President Mahinda Rajapaksa took steps to devalue a rupee by 3 percent. Due to it, the economy suffered heavily as the dollar was artificially kept stable.
He further said that nobody uttered a word regarding a huge price reduction of vegetables during the festive season.
Commenting on the moving of May Day celebrations for May 7, he said the government rescheduled the May Day celebrations to May 7, as it was duty bound to the protection and fosterng of the Buddha Sasana. Therefore, we have given the utmost place and priority for Buddhism as mentioned in the Constitution, rather than May Day celebrations, “ he added.
