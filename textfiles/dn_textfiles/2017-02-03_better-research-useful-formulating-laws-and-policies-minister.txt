Better research useful in formulating laws and policies: Minister

Better research is useful in formulating laws and policies, Justice and Buddha Sasana Minister Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe said.
The minister was addressing a gathering at the inauguration ceremony of the Colombo Law Faculty Legal Research Unit.
“Throughout history, justice ministers were making the law without connection of the Law Faculty.
They were only analysing and criticising. Usually, the Attorney General’s Department and the legal draftsmen are given a limited time to formulate laws on adhoc basis. In future, the research unit can contribute when taking policy decisions and in formulating laws,” he said. The minister said measures were being taken to make changes to the Criminal Procedure Code and the Penal Code.
“Many issues of law reforms come up and as there is no proper research done, it is very hard to solve them. If proper researches are done, then discussions on them can be made and laws can be passed for the people’s benefit,” he said.
He said people are also losing confidence on law and order. Policies should not be formulated without proper research as it is not a good practice.
Speaking about the proposed amendments to the Criminal Procedure Code, the minister said that allowing lawyers to access suspects before trial would cause disturbance to relevant investigations.
“The Research Unit will benefit all Sri Lankans and it is of historical importance,” he said.
