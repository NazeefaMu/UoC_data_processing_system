SL has become political museum - Dr. de Costa

Sri Lanka has now become a constitutional museum, with its array of electoral systems and power struggles regarding the executive and legislature, prominent political analyst, President’s Counsel Dr. Jayatissa de Costa said .
In his broad analysis of the current political situation in the country, he noted that Sri Lanka has three organs of governance, the Executive, Legislature and Judiciary. “Under the first constitution of Sri Lanka, the Soulbury Constitution, there was a clear definition of division of powers. The Executive, Legislature and Judiciary was listed separately and defined.”
Sirimavo Bandaranaike who created history by becoming the World’s First Woman Prime Minister in July 1960, won the Parliamentary Elections in 1970 contesting as the United Front formed the Government and turning the parliament into a Constituent Assembly drafted a new Republican Constitution. It was promulgated on 22 May 1972 and this Constitution provided for a unicameral legislature named the National State Assembly with a term of office of six (6) years and Sovereignty was entirely vested in it. Then J. R. Jayewardene who came to office in July 1977 with a five-sixths majority passed the second amendment to the 1972 Constitution on 4 October 1977 and he became the first Executive President of Sri Lanka on February 4, 1978.
“It all changed under the J.R. Jayawardena government as he became somewhat of a dictator and the present crisis is a direct consequence of this constitution. In fact N.M. Perera predicted this a couple of weeks after this constitution at the time and today all his fears have come true,” Dr. De Costa said.
Expressing his views on the issue of parliamentary majority, he noted that today in parliament the biggest single party is led by Mahinda Rajapaksa. “There are around 106 members in the UNF. There are six JVP MPs, and another 14 are from the TNA. Leaving them aside, the Mahinda Rajapaksa camp has more on their side as a single party. Moreover, although many are pro UNP and anti-Mahinda, that does not necessarily mean that all of them want Ranil Wickremesinghe as the Prime Minister. Therefore, this parliament can be termed as a hung parliament as no one has absolute majority. Hence, you cannot have stability,” he explained.
In such a time of constitutional crisis, the country has turned to the judiciary with the hope that it would provide some consolation.
“Today everyone is eagerly anticipating an independent decision from the Supreme Court on December 7 and constitutional provisions can be interpreted by the seven member bench on that day (7). That verdict will affect the present situation and the judicial decision will also affect the executive and the legislature. It will have very significant results, but as a country it is not a good stand as there is no stable government.”
