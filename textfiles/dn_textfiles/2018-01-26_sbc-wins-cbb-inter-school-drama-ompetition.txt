SBC wins the CBB Inter School Drama ompetition

St. Bridget’s Convent secured the championship of the CBB Drama Competition for the second year running with their colorful and energetic rendition of ‘The Importance of Being Earnest’ by Oscar Wilde. The adaptation skilfully edited by the director Malinthi Perera conveyed the essence of the play in a nutshell.
Competing against local and international schools was no easy task especially for an all girls’ cast competing with mixed casts. Ultimately, it was all down to hard work, prayer and the grace of God.
Having done tragedies and emotionally charged dramas for quite some time now, in the inter school drama scene as well as in their annual productions, they wanted a contrast. Having been finalists at every drama competition they have participated in since 2010, they had many expectations to fulfil and the pressure to choose a suitable play which would enable them to use their talents to the maximum was high. It was a bold leap of faith to pass into the comedic genre but even more of a risk to choose period play. Nevertheless, with many prayers and long discussions they went ahead with an extract from Oscar Wilde’s hilarious comedy of manners.
The 5th Annual Inter Schools Drama competition organized by the Council for Business with Britain was held last year at the Bishop’s College Auditorium. 18 schools (including schools from Galle, Kurunegala, Negombo and Wattala) competed.
St Bridget’s Convent won the competition for the second time consecutively with their elegant and witty extract from “The Importance of Being Ernest” by Oscar Wilde. The producer Malinthi Perera has produced two winning plays – in 2016 and 2017. St Bridget’s were also Runners Up two times.
