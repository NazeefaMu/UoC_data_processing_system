Fitch downgrades Sunshine Holdings to ‘A-(lka)’; Outlook Stable

Fitch Ratings has downgraded Sri Lanka-based Sunshine Holdings PLC’s National Long-Term Rating to ‘A-(lka)’ from ‘A(lka)’. The Outlook is Stable.
The downgrade reflects Fitch’s expectations that Sunshine’s net leverage - defined as lease-adjusted debt net of cash/operating EBITDAR, including proportionate consolidation of Estate Management Services (Private) Limited (EMSPL), the holding company for the agriculture and consumer goods segments - will remain higher than the level commensurate with a higher rating over the next three years.
The higher leverage is due to the substantial increase in debt following Sunshine’s acquisition of an additional stake in EMSPL from Tata Global Beverages for Rs 2.9 billion on 28 December 2017.
The acquisition will increase Sunshine’s ownership of EMSPL to 60%, from 33.2%, and improve the fungibility of group cash flow.
