JO highlights country’s economic plight

The Joint Opposition(JO)said yesterday that the foreign exchange rates including the rupee is getting devalued by the day and soon the selling rate for a US dollar will top Rs.170, MP Bandula Gunewardene said. Addressing the media in Colombo,he said that the economic situation in the country continues to get weaker and this would impact the entire country in a negative manner.
Meanwhile, Prof.G.L Peiris compared the current economic situation in Sri Lanka with that of Greece before the latter’s economy collapsed in a big way.
He also said that an opposition parliamentary group had recently visited the International Monetary Fund (IMF) office in Colombo and had made the officials aware about the current economic crisis and the government’s imprudent handling of the economy.
Prof. Peiris went on to say that the European Union which has supported the Lankan economy subject to conditions over the years too had a responsibility to pressurize the government to do away with their wrong strategies and policies. The former minister also predicted that the government will continue to heap more burdens on the public by way of taxes and price increases as they had no alternatives or solutions to overcome the present crisis.
