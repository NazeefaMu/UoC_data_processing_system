ICTA upgrades divisional, district secretariat websites

Upon discovering flaws in divisional and district secretariat websites countrywide, the Information and Communication Technology Agency of Sri Lanka (ICTA-SL) had launched a programme to improve the said sites, recently.
It was initiated under the instructions of the Prime Minister’s Office and is being carried out in close cooperation with the Home Affairs Ministry. At present, the upgrading of websites had been completed in the Galle district, with the Colombo district slated for upgrading next.
The said programme aims to overcome security vulnerabilities and to provide user-friendly interfaces, while ensuring that staff are trained to update information on the websites. The ICTA had made preparations to upgrade 331 divisional secretariat and 25 district secretariat websites.
At present, three government officers from each district secretariat are being trained to maintain their websites. The Home Affairs Ministry is currently recruiting personnel to ensure the proper maintenance of websites. The websites are expected to play a critical role in the disclosure of information as required under the Right to Information Act.
