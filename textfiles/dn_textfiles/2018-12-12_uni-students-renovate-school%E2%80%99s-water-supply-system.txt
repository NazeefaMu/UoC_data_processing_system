Uni students renovate school’s water supply system

The renovated water supply system of the Maduluwawa Maha Vidyalaya in Padukka was opened on November 21.
The water supply system was renovated by first-year undergraduates of the Management and Finance Faculty of the Colombo University, under their community development project, ‘Diyawara Dothak Sarasavi Dethak’ at a cost of Rs. 170,000.
The school which provides education to 542 students with 16 teachers had faced many difficulties without a proper water supply system for the past five years.
The project was successfully completed under the guidance of Yasantha Madurapperuma and Rajistha de Alwis.
