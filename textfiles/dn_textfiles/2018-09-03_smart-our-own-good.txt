Smart for our own good

I enjoyed Michelle Dean’s Sharp: The women who made an art of having an opinion, but I have to admit that most of my enjoyment consisted of daydreaming about all the books I was going to read after I finished it. There is a whole literary subgenre now that trades in this sort of deferred pleasure – books with subtitles like “My year of reading” or “Unpacking my library” or “One hundred books I read in the bathtub during my sabbatical in the south of France”. When you read about someone working their way through their intended-to-impress reading list, it helps you to imagine that you too are capable of accomplishing such a feat. Often, these books involve either a man reading the Greek and Roman classics or a woman tackling the thick Victorian novels – canons both familiar and fusty enough to keep me from losing my mind with envy.
Not so in the case of Sharp. Dear God, what a sexy reading list Michelle Dean has put together. Never have I seen so clearly that my dream version of myself – the person I always assumed I would grow up to be – is a drily witty, slightly abrasive woman in a black turtleneck whose end table is stacked high with yellowed paperback copies of lesser-known works by Susan Sontag, Joan Didion and Hannah Arendt. If I were living my best life, I would spend my evenings at parties declaiming at length about the virtues of Arendt’s unfairly neglected biography of Rahel Varnhagen, and if any man dared insult me by bringing up Heidegger, I would put my cigarette out on his arm.
Literary women
Dean does an excellent job of moving swiftly through her list of writers, culling from these “women who made an art of having an opinion” quotations, jokes and arguments most likely to appeal to the literary women of 2018. Did you know that Rebecca West once called out H. G. Wells, for “the sex obsession that lay clotted on [his novels] like cold white sauce” only to shortly thereafter become his lover?
I was also delighted to learn that, in her early twenties, Arendt liked to write long, dire predictions for herself in the third person, like this one: “Most likely she will continue to pursue her life in idle experiments and a curiosity without rights or foundation, until finally the long and eagerly awaited end takes her unawares, putting an arbitrary stop to her useless activity”. Dean, herself an accomplished book reviewer, has an eye for excellence in the reviews of others.
She notes how Malcolm Cowley, unlike most of the other critics of the time, was able to identify the strength of Mary McCarthy’s sexually explicit, wildly popular short story “The Man in the Brooks Brothers Suit”: “Miss McCarthy has learned the difficult art of setting everything down as it might have happened, without telling a single self-protective lie”. Could an author of auto­biographical fiction receive a higher com­pliment than that? Perhaps the finest moment in Sharp, though, is Dorothy Parker’s parodic takedown of F. Scott Fitzgerald:
Polished sides
Rosalind rested her nineteen year-old elbows on her nineteen-year-old knees. All that you could see of her, above the polished sides of the nineteen-year-old bathtub, was her bobbed, curly hair and her disturbing gray eyes. A cigarette drooped lazily from the spoiled curves of her nineteen-year-old mouth.
Yes, Parker anticipated the recent, scathing Twitter thread “Describe yourself like a male author would” by almost a hundred years.
What I’m saying is, this book lands right in my wheelhouse. I would go so far as to say that Sharp was written expressly for me (a former English major in her mid-thirties with such an over-romanticized view of the Intellectual Life that she accidentally spent more than a decade in graduate school), except that it’s actually dedicated to “Every person who’s ever been told, ‘you’re too smart for your own good’”. Unfortunately, no one has ever told me that – though I’d certainly like to believe that people were thinking it. (I would also like to say that, after I read Sharp, I immediately went out and read the Rahel Varnhagen biography and formed my own sharp opinion on it; but in reality all I did was to add a bunch of titles to my Goodreads list and then ignore them in favour of my advance copy of the new Tana French.)
Now that a month has passed, I have finished exactly none of the books I thought Sharp was going to inspire me to read, inducing a more cynical mood. Sharp is not, in fact, a memoir about the experience of reading the work of twentieth-century female writers. It is a book about those women themselves, consisting of thumbnail profiles and quick critical assessments of Dorothy Parker, Rebecca West, Hannah Arendt, Mary McCarthy, Susan Sontag, Pauline Kael, Joan Didion, Nora Ephron, Renata Adler and Janet Malcolm, with excursions into the work of two others: Zora Neale Hurston and Lillian Hellman. Dean opens the book by announcing, “I gathered the women in this book under the sign of a compliment that every one of them received in their lives: they were called sharp”. Well, OK, but there’s got to be more to it than that. My sense is that Dean originally planned to write about women who worked as cultural critics – reviewers of literature, drama and film – but that as she got swept up in her research, she expanded her definition of a “critic” so widely that the word no longer functioned as a useful criterion for inclusion, and so she was forced to cast about for another, without quite landing on one that satisfies.
Simple-mindedness
It feels as if the women on Dean’s list do have something important in common, but the precise nature of that something is surprisingly hard to pin down. They could not all be described, for one thing, as feminists: Sontag “roared” at Adrienne Rich about the “simple-mindedness” of feminism, having previously defended it, and Ephron felt “uneasy” about organized feminist efforts at the Democratic convention in 1972. Likewise, only some of these writers – Sontag and Arendt – were capital-I Intellectuals. Kael was a movie critic. McCarthy and Hurston were best known for their fiction. Adler is most famous for her reportage. The famously witty Nora Ephron, meanwhile, in addition to writing the screenplay for When Harry Met Sally and the gut-busting novel Heartburn, once wrote one hell of a parody of Ayn Rand:
Twenty-five years ago, Howard Roark laughed. Standing naked at the edge of a cliff, his face painted, his hair the colour of a bright orange rind, his body a composition of straight, clean lines and angles, each curve breaking into smooth, clean planes, Howard Roark laughed.
On the other hand, one suspects that some writers on the list (Arendt, for example) wouldn’t know a good joke if it jumped up and bit them. Times Literary Supplement
