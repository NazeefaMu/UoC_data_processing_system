New State Minister pledges to render yeoman service

The newly sworn-in Law and Order and Southern Development State Minister Piyasena Gamage, requested the support of the ministry staff to render a great service to the country in 2018, in accordance with the wishes of the good governance government.
He added that President Maithripala Sirisena and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe, as the pioneers of the good governance government, expect the maintenance of peace in the country and the development of the South.
“The President insisted that I look into the development of the Galle district since Minister Sagala Ratnayaka could attend to the Matara district development,” State Minister Gamage said.
He made these observations yesterday morning after assuming duties at the Ministry in Suhurupaya.
He said he was pleased to work with Minister Ratnayaka since they were friends coming from the adjoining villages of Deniyaya and Hiniduma in the Southern Province. He added that he got a great opportunity to serve the people under the President and Prime Minister’s good governance government after being neglected as a senior minister during the previous government.
He said after he swore-in as a Member of Parliament on November 10, the President instructed him to work as the State Minister of Law and Order and Southern Development.
“I was reluctant as it was a State Ministry and requested to remain as a member for some time,” said State Minister Gamage.
“But later, he insisted me to take over a responsibility and take over this State Ministerial Portfolio. Then I took over last Thursday.”
Minister Nimal Siripala de Silva, Deputy Minister Nishantha Muthuhettigama, Provincial Councillor Randima Gamage, Law and Order and Southern Development State Ministry Secretary Pathmasiri Jayamanna, IGP Pujith Jayasundra also participated.
