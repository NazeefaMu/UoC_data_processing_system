Tasty or tacky?

It’s likely that if you don’t have a tattoo yourself you know someone who does. No longer confined to sailors and prisoners, tattoos firmly have a place in mainstream culture.
Some people opt for double sleeves, while others may have a discreet inking hidden somewhere on their body. And even if someone looks bare, it could be another story underneath their clothes.
