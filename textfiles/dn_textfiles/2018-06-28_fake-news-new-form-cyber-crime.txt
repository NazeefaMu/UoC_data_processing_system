FAKE NEWS: NEW FORM OF CYBER CRIME

It is too soon to say whether Google or Facebook would accelerate their initiatives to prevent the spread of fake news and even if they did, whether the attempts would have a significant impact. However, the threats caused by fake news are not likely to go away as they have now become part and parcel of what the people have come to expect.
The Institute of National Security Studies Sri Lanka (INSSSL) recently organised a symposium on ‘Media and Democracy; Misinformation, fake news and its impact on national security’ at the Defence Ministry in which the speakers highlighted that the proliferation of fake news on the internet and its associated media has been identified as a new form of cybercrime endangering free debate, social peace and national security in many countries across the globe.
Defence Ministry to counter fake news
The military force of our country countered terrorism, but today, misinformation campaigns, fake news and electronic espionage operations have become the cutting edge of modern warfare. The Defence Ministry is now focusing on how to protect the country against these new threats.
Defence Secretary Kapila Waidyaratne, PC, affirmed that the mission of the Defence Ministry was to ensure a secure and peaceful country and to achieve this through planning and executing strategies and policies for a secure, safe and sovereign country with total territorial integrity.
Waidyaratne, speaking about the danger of fake news and online radicalisation, said that it can be used to mobilise the masses and make them engage in violent acts on religion, racial and ethnic issues. He pointed out that the recent violence in Digana was one such example.
He noted that the importance of focussing on this matter lies in upholding the collective responsibility of narrating the truth, promoting the truth and protecting audiences from the dangers of fake news.
“Misuse of various media insights violence, spreads uncertainty and is a sure threat to national security and democracy. We are also vested with the responsibility of making social media a democratic space with rules and guidelines,” he said.
Waidyaratne highlighted the importance of making policies to avoid situations such as the country encountered earlier this year and added that preventing proliferation of fake news requires productive efforts, open minds and coherent strategies.
Military and technical perspective of misinformation
Group Captain M.D.A.G. Seneviratne was of the opinion that being exposed to an ‘overload of information’ was dangerous.
Explaining that we were facing a crisis of credibility, he noted that with the dramatic increase and speed in transmitting information, there was a drastic decline in objectivity and accuracy. “News is true unless it is proven otherwise.”
Seneviratne pointed out that from a military perspective, dissemination of information to the public was always a concern. He further said that the major threat to the military today was the information released to the public and the right to information had to accompany the ‘responsibility of information’.
“We should create awareness among people on the credibility of social media. Regulation is needed on misinformation in the public domain. When the platform changes, people would still have credibility issues. And to counteract it with censorship is not the solution. We need to find smart methods to deal with it,” he said.
Seneviratne emphasised the need to capitalise on the digital revolution and keep moving forward.
Roshan Chandragupta from the Computer Emergency Readiness Team (CERT) brought in the technical perspective: “It is difficult to identify individuals behind certain accounts on social media, track IP addresses and obtain court orders to do so. We need to balance data privacy and privacy of users against the need for regulation.”
He said that information spreads so quickly that it was called a global village today. “But technically speaking, it is not at all easy to manage, as it comprises different organisations.”
Accuracy is in eyes of beholder
The accessibility and instantaneous quality of online news platforms has propelled the rise of a new arena for information, but also misinformation.
Professor Gihan Dias from the Moratuwa University said that people go after news because often, it affected them in some way, and at other instances, it incited curiosity even though it might not affect them personally.
He said that the reasons for people to get news via social media were because it was convenient, fast, personalised, considered reliable and self-selecting.
Dias further said that the accuracy of fake news was mostly judged in the eyes of the beholder and that is how a post was shared and re-shared. “Sometimes fake news is spread on organised media as well, but they do have a limit, unlike social media. People go after what they consider true on social media and do what needs to be done to disseminate the news they believe is true,” he said.
He explained that the danger of fake news was that people select the news that they want and the audience strongly believes the news which might lead to issues in future. “People continue to follow what they believe is true and unfollow, unfriend or delete what they consider false. So it is how they perceive things. And there are issues in identifying distinctions between fake and real news to avoid confusion among people,” he said.
Harindra Dassanayake from the President’s Media Unit stated that he was inspired by Andy Warhol’s words, “In the future, everyone will be world famous for 15 minutes,” which appeared in the programme for a 1968 exhibition of his work at the Moderna Museet in Stockholm, Sweden, and added that Warhol’s saying has turned out to be true today. “Today, people are not bothered about what they share; instead, they focus on the number of likes and shares the post would get,” he said.
The speaker reminded the audience that we are living in a world where information was on overload and added that it came with a package of non-reliable information.
Dassanayake, pointing out the recent incident that happened in Ampara where a tense situation arose over allegations that fertility pills were mixed with food, said that fake news usually accelerated existing issues. “If a person has an intention of deceiving someone or creating conflict, he will always find a way to do that and the easiest way now is social media. And intention is not something that can be proved by anyone,” he said.
Dassanayake highlighted that fake news was not new. Even in the ‘good old days’ it was prevalent, but it spread slowly. Today, with the speedy development of technology, millions of people get to know fake or true news in seconds. “There is no change in the content of the fake news, only its form has changed,” he said.
His concern was that blocking social media was not the solution to the issue.
Dassanayake finally said that there are many other countries in the globe looking for ways to curb the spread of fake news.
Global fight against fake news
A December 2016 survey by the Pew Research Centre in USA suggests that 23 percent of US adults have shared fake news, knowingly or unknowingly, with friends and others. Data experts in Sri Lanka also revealed that there was a drastic increase in people following fake news and misinformation.
‘weaponised narratives’
Director of Bandaranaike Centre for International Studies, Dr Harinda Vidanage said that globally, dissemination of fake news became a hot topic after the US Presidential Election in 2016. He said the concept proposed by security researchers was that there are ongoing ‘weaponised narratives’ which look at misinformation, disinformation and fake news and its political impact.
He highlighted that most of the fake news challenged democracy and added that countries that are open to democracy face more issues compared to the rest. It is not a problem for countries that have traditionally not been democratic, he added. “We have entered a post-factual society. It is a great challenge to deal with a society that does not accept or regard facts,” he said.
Dr Vidanage said that he preferred calling the context of faking news as ‘narrative’ and added that more than what it is called, “the most powerful is the story that is spread.”
Even though online platforms have been used in politics since 1995, he said it was from 2007 that all security establishments in the world started to look at cyberspace as a threat to national security. It was at that time that the world realised that cyberspace can be used by a third country to destabilise the political process of another country without using traditional methods of war.
“It was after 2007 that even the US started developing serious cybersecurity responses on a global scale and it is still looking for a narrative. After 2010, it became more political, ever since WikiLeaks, as cyberspace became a liberation technology for some people,” he said.
Revealing the fact that since 2010 there are more than 70 countries today actively using cyber-weaponisation projects, Dr Vidanage said that after 2016, it was found that cyber-weaponisation was a threat where a third country is able to manipulate the international political process of a country by compromising the minds of its people. This was especially highlighted in the allegation that Russia undermined democracy in the US through its social media.
He pointed out that fake news brings destruction to the internal and external security of a country. These can get combined as well - an internal hate campaign of a country can be carried out by an external party.
Citing the upcoming election in Sweden as an example, he said people are being warned about the overload of information that is being spread, which has turned out to be one of the major worries of that country. According to Dr Vidanage, even though Sri Lankans believe that an election in the country is a local matter, it is also geopolitical. “Sri Lankans are very sensitive about what we see. Depriving people of what is true, cyberspace has made people look at what is comfortable. That is a dangerous threat. People are picking and choosing news which they like and as a result, there will be serious political and economic repercussions,” he said.
Dr Vidanage said that academia also contributed to the decay of truth and emphasised the need to promote the idea of truth irrespective of who was in power.
Information and Communication Technology Agency (ICTA) Chairman Prof. Rohan Samarajiva proposed self regulation as an expected solution to this issue, though it was going to be very difficult in Sri Lanka. He said that there are possibilities to introduce norms and ethics for organised media institutions, but it was hardly possible to implement the same for social media. “If an organised media institution violates the norms, its accreditation can be cancelled. But social media has no accreditation,” he said.
Explaining that even self-regulation could be difficult in Sri Lanka, he said even in the traditional media, the newspapers that were established in the past few years have refused to adhere to accepted norms of regulation. “Regarding the option of criminalisation, in the case of Sri Lanka, Article 14(1)(a) grants every citizen the right to freedom of speech, but there is a need to balance this right with regulating fake news, hate speech and incitement of violence via media platforms,” he said.
In Malaysia, the Anti-Fake News Act, entered into force on 11 April and its content-based offences are much broader than those that already exist in legislation like the Sedition Act, Communications and Multimedia Act, or the Penal Code. Two months after it was enforced, it was reported in the media that the Malaysian Communication Minister intended to repeal the law.
Samarajiva said that even Sri Lanka could implement laws like in Malaysia, but questioned whether it would be practical to implement if the convicted person is residing in another country. Chandragupta was also of the same opinion that when information is published on a website owned by a person living in a different country, challenging it was not practical unless it was a threat to national security. “The technical details are more complicated than what is apparent. Who is going to decide the credibility of the information? The institutions will always have their own agendas,” he said.
