Trump’s decision unifies Iranians in denunciation

IRAN: The Iranian press and people from all political leanings have lashed out alike at the United States over its withdrawal from the multilateral nuclear deal with the Islamic Republic, while a student rally has been planned in the capital to condemn the move.
Newspapers associated with either the Reformists or the Principlists, widely seen as the two main political camps in the country, on Wednesday ran headlines condemning the Tuesday decision by US President Donald Trump.
Students from different universities in Tehran were gathering in front of the former US embassy building to protest Washington’s failure to fulfill its commitment under the agreement.
The protesters were condemning the United States' “hostile attitude” towards the Iranian nation and its lack of commitment vis-à-vis the country on numerous occasions, Tasnim news agency said.
“We will proceed towards a bright future with or without sanctions,” the headline on the daily Ettela’at hearemark said, quoting President Hassan Rouhani.
Kayhan paper, which is largely viewed as a Principlist daily, said, “Trump tore up the JCPOA, it is time [for us] to burn it,” referring to the 2015 agreement by its official name, the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action.
Etemad, a reformist paper, and Iran wrote, “The nuclear deal without the interloper,” referring to the US.
Wide-circulation Hamshahri wrote, “The JCPOA stayed. The US left,” while Arman-e Emrouz republished a remark made by the European Union foreign policy chief Federica Mogherini, who had said earlier that the bloc would keep honoring the deal.
Wide-circulation Hamshahri paper’s headline for May 19, 2018 reads, “The JCPOA stayed. The US left.”
The JCPOA was signed between Iran and the five permanent members of the United Nations Security Council -- the US, the UK, France, Russia, and China -- plus Germany. It removed nuclear-related sanctions on Tehran in exchange for restrictions on Iran’s nuclear program in certain aspects.
Trump, who had been threatening to pull out of the accord since his inauguration last January, including by warning to “tear up” the deal, announced Washington’s withdrawal from the agreement on Tuesday.
Other signatories to the deal, as well as the United Nations and the EU had warned Washington against any bid to sabotage it. They call the JCPOA a pillar of regional and international peace and stability, and reiterate the multilateral pact cannot be simply terminated by a single party.
Only hours after the move was announced, Iranian students and some lawmakers took to Azadi Square in the capital, setting fire to American flags and shouting anti-US slogans.
The students called on the government to counter the US decision by leaving the accord.
MP Hossein Naqavi Hosseini said, “On the back of unity between the people and authorities, we will deliver such a response to the Americans that will make them regret [their decision]."
"The US showed that it does not commit to international regulations,” said the lawmaker who is also the spokesman for Parliament’s Committee on National Security and Foreign Policy.
All countries should beware of the possibility of Washington’s reneging on its promises, the MP added. - PRESS TV
