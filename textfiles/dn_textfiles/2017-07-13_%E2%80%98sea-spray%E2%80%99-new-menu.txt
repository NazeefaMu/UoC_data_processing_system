‘Sea Spray’ with a new menu

The Galle Face Hotel’s seafood restaurant ‘Sea Spray’ is debuting a delicious new menu that features Round Island’s premium quality barramundi as a signature dish. This sustainable and commercially farmed produce has a distinctive taste and will star in a new menu developed by Executive Chef, Adam Gaunt Evans for the restaurant.
Their new menu brings a fresh and contemporary feel to Sri Lankan seafood. It is crafted entirely of fresh seasonal island produce and coastal seafood prepared in a variety of styles. Chef Adam Gaunt Evans has brought simplicity to the table; “There is no better way to showcase seafood,” he says in a recently issued press release “-especially when the produce is so fresh and distinctive.”
Chef Evans has chosen Round Island’s signature barramundi for his signature dish.
‘Steamed Round Island Barramundi with Ginger Chilli Sauce’ is made from a premium fillet cut simply marinated in lime juice, salt and pepper, and gently steamed in a bamboo steamer basket until it is just cooked.
The Round Island barramundi is served with a zesty sauce made of ginger, chilli, garlic, coriander and soy sauce.
Chef Evans says that this is why he chose Round Island’s barramundi for his seafood dishes. “There is no substitute for quality and freshness when it comes to seafood,” he notes. “As a chef, I don’t need to do much to showcase Round Island’s barramundi- it’s delicious and already a favourite with our diners.”
