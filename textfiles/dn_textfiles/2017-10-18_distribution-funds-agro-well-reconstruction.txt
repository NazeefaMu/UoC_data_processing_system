Distribution of funds for agro-well reconstruction

The Yahapalana government has no problems regarding political parties constituting it. The two main parties are following a new political journey in unity, endeavouring to rebuild the country. People should be provided maximum facilities possible. However, we will face the forthcoming local government elections separately.
Then we can fight on dogmatic issues and conduct a campaign based on principles by eschewing political thuggery, said SLFP General Secretary and Agriculture Minister Duminda Dissanayake.
He was addressing a meeting to mark the distribution of funds for the rehabilitation and reconstruction of agro-wells in Anuradhapura district under the Food Production National Program recently.
A government grant of Rs. 200,000 is made under this program for the rehabilitation and reconstruction of each agro-well and an easy loan up to a maximum of Rs. 200,000 is given for the purchase of water pumps and pipes at 6 percent interest.
Rs. 150,000 was distributed among a batch of 400 farmers as the first stage of the program on this day.
Minister Dissanayake said the balance money needed for the rehabilitation of agro-wells would be given in stages.
The Minister said that we should prepare our strategies to face future climate changes. The agro-wells project was launched to prepare in facing any possible drought.
Farmers gathered at auditorium to receive their cheques for Agro-well reconstruction.
The Minister said the country did not receive the expected rainfall during the last two years, while unexpected rainfall was experienced during unwanted periods causing damage to crops. These climate changes were common to all countries in the world, but we should not neglect agricultural activities in the face of such catastrophes, he added.
The Minister said they would invite all house holders to cultivate some sort of food crop or vegetable in their home gardens so that they could relieve the burden on their purse strings. It is hoped to develop 500,000 home gardens throughout the country with the help of women’s organisations.
Plans would be implemented to rehabilitate 1000 tanks in the country. This rehabilitation project would be genuine and not a farce as done during the previous regime where contractors raked in millions of rupees by doing a roughshod job.
A sum of Rs 5 million had been provided to each DS division to rehabilitate agricultural roads. It had been planned to cultivate coconut on 10,000 acres in the NCP. All parties in the government had joined hands to develop the country without any political or other differences.
Parliamentarian Chandima Gamage Mahindasoma, former Minister W. B. Ekanayake and several local politicians and officials participated.
