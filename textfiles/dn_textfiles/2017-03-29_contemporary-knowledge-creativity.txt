Contemporary knowledge via creativity

This reviewer is grateful for the arrival of this excellent book meant for teenagers, although adults like me could gain information on such subjects like ecology, peace and value of human qualities. The text is educative but presented in creative form with stories, anecdotes and the like thus evoking the interest of the reader. It is an easy and lucid style that the writer employs to make what he wants stress effectively.
The title of the book, I feel, carefully chosen- Blue indicates studies centering on the Ocean and Green indicates the Greenery in the Land. The importance of cherishing Human Values is the undertone of the writer’s intention. He succeeds in his effort. There are 12 topics he takes for elucidation. And under each subject thought provoking questions to answer relevant questions that could reinforce a total understanding of the subjects discussed.
These are the 12 topics in English translation:
01. A Good World full of Blue and Green (Does the author also suggests the good governance envisaged by the two political parties at present using their party colours? I don’t know)
02. Beautiful Sea Coast in Moonlit Dusk
03. The Home Garden of Appan
04. Each drop of water is priceless
05. Making use of the Resources and practicing good Habits
06. Many usages of planting trees and make them grow
07. Living Beings that speak, sing and dance ( In this otherwise good printed book, a typo error has occurred in the word “Uyirinangal”
08. The beautiful hillcountry that is attractive make your body cold.
09. Resourceful desert jungles
10. Happy Life in a beautiful village
11. The Living Beings that live in jungles, the birds that fly in the sky, those beings that crawl on the land and swim in water are all our friends
12. Peace and Trouble Free World allover
What I like most in this book is how the fundamentals of good living are subtly given as a creative writing.
I must say something about the writer of this book. Hailing from Uduppiddy, an educated village in the north of the country, S.ThillaiNadaRaasa is a versatile man of many parts. I knew him as an actor on the stage and radio- an improvising actor, a creative writer with many books for children, a trilinguist ,a public speaker that adds personal anecdote sand make the audience laugh, a wonderful human being a well - known Public Servant.
It wouldn’t be inappropriate if I give his credentials for file of record of a successful public servant among other things:
Government Agent/ District Secretary Director , Department of Hindu Cultural Affairs Additional Secretary, Ministry of Education Member of National Library Services and Documentation Board Member National Book Development Council of Sri Lanka Member of Tower Hall Foundation Member Public Performances Board Adviser to the Department of Archeology Member of Sri Lanka Arts Council Chairman of Tamil Drama Panel Member of State Printing Corporation Member of Educational Publication Board Member of National Textile Producers Association Member of Delimitation Commission Appeal Panel member of National Police Commission Coordinator of National Finance Commission Coordinator of the Education Project of World Bank Member of Public Service Commission Member of National Salaries and Cadre Commission Chairman Hindu Encyclopedia Consultant, Department of Hindu Cultural Affairs Member of Advisory Board- Thinakaran News Paper of Lake House Advisor, Royal College Tamil Dramatic Club Member of Appeal Panel, Governor’s Secretariat, Western Province Resource Person, Department of Education Western Province Resource Person, National Institute of Labour Studies Patron of Past Pupils Association, Jaffna Hindu College, Colombo President of Past Pupils Association, Uduppiddy American Mission College, Colombo Branch. Advisor of NorCey Media(Pvt) Limited, Sri Lanka 10 years experience as Assistant Commissioner in the Department of Corperative Development.
It should be made a compulsory supplement for GCE O/A Levels Students.
