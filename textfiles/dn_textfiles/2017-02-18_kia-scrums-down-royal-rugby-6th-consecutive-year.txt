KIA scrums down with Royal Rugby for 6th consecutive year

The rugby development programme of Royal College will continue to be supported in 2017 by top Korean automobile brand Kia under a sponsorship deal ratified in Colombo recently.
This is the sixth consecutive year that Kia is backing the Reid Avenue boys as sole team sponsor and the third year of its Rs 27 million sponsorship that encompasses the college’s first XV as well as the Under 14, Under 16 and Under 18 rugby teams.
KIA’s sponsorship agreement was signed at the Royal Sports Complex by the directors of KIA Motors (Lanka) Limited and the Chairman and members of the Royal College Rugby Advisory Committee.
“Our support to Royal Rugby has given us a great deal of satisfaction,” Kia Motors (Lanka) Managing Director Mahen Thambiah said.
“The teams are playing well and the development of younger players is making good progress. These are not the best of times for the automobile sector in Sri Lanka, but Kia not a fair weather friend. We are committed to the success of Royal Rugby and look forward to witness some inspiring performances from the boys this year.”
“Sports have long been an unwavering passion for Kia Motors, which believes in the power of sports to move the world,” Thambiah added. “In support of the passion, performance, and touching moments that sports competitions offer, Kia is wholeheartedly involved in sponsorship activities for athletes and major and minor sporting events worldwide.”
Royal College Rugby Advisory and Management Committee chairman Rohantha Peiris praised Kia for their continues support for Royal rugby and said they hope that the commitment will last long for a decade.
“The sponsorship will cover almost all aspects including nourishment and other facilities for players and we have launched a long term programme to uplift the sport at Royal College.
Royal has produced some ruggerites who went on to shine in national and international rugby arena and above all we want to inculcate values and qualities of rugby in Royalists, so they will mould into good citizens,” Rohantha explained.
Royal College’s first XV retained the Bradby Shield in 2016 after the double header against arch rivals Trinity College was tied 35 each, and retained the B. C. Anghie Trophy defeating St. Peter’s College 33 - 24.
The team relinquished the Michael Gunaratne Trophy and the Milroy Fernando Trophy, but gave fans much to cheer about with many memorable games, including a nail biting draw against St. Joseph’s College in the Singer League, in which it took third place.
Royal College was also the runner-up in the 2016 all island Milo President’s Trophy knockout tournament.
The Royal College First XV team will be captained by fly half Ovin Seniya Askey in 2017 and have eight coloursmen. Having taken part in promoting some of the most highly anticipated events such as the Australian Open tennis championship, the FIFA World Cup and UEFA European Football Championship, Kia is committed to furthering the development of sports around the world. Rafael Nadal, one of the greatest tennis players of the modern era, is KIA’s Global Brand Ambassador. In Sri Lanka, KIA Motors (Lanka) Limited, has represented the KIA brand as sole agent since 1996.
