Women’s triple jump final

This should be an engrossing duel between the undisputed queen for the past few years, Colombia's 33-year-old Olympic champion Caterine Ibarguen and the pretender to her throne Yulimar Rojas, who could bring some much-needed cheer to Venezuela.
However, if Rojas the Olympic silver medallist thinks she can seize the world crown from the Colombian then she has another thing coming for Ibarguen is keen to win her third successive world title. "There are no doubts," said Ibarguen.
"I am aiming for a third world championships victory in London. Winning in Rio was great but I am still hungry for more."
