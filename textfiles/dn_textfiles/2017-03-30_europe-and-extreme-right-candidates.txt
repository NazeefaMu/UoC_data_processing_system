Europe and the Extreme Right Candidates

Cold gales of extremism are blowing over Europe from North America.
Religious sectarianism is now fuelling violence in the capitals of the so called civilised sections of the world kindling arguments that would once have been forbidden by the laws of these countries. The world seems to be deciding whether multiculturalism and globalisation does work or not.
With the policies of President Donald to clean the United States of Terrorism extreme right leaders in the old continent are confidently making headway with blowing anti Islam trumpets around Europe West to East and North to South. The first extreme right casualty has been the infamous Dutchman Geert Wilders. Yet the extreme anti Muslim feelings have grown from Italy to Sweden, from Spain to the borders of Turkey where anti-European feelings grow stronger by the minute.
So, what has gone wrong?
Countries were created by a world order victors of two world wars who to stop the turmoil in Europe “invented” the United Nations to create Israel the Biblical mythological country “Israel” to pacify Jews who were hounded out of many countries including the British Isles, France, Spain, Portugal and of course Germany. This became the tinder of the wars of Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and Syria. In each case the Western powers were using their firepower and the servile United Nations to instigate regime change of anyone who opposed Israel or the Western countries.
Socialists and Communist Trade Unions
The Muslim colonies of these countries had by then been exporting cheap labour to the factories of the industrialised west. The older generation of Arab and sub Saharan Muslims mostly illiterate very hard working and raised young families to respect law and order. They soon became naturalise British, Frenchmen or Germans on paper. But how real was their naturalisation.
In the 1970s I was as working class as they were and pushing buttons on machines in a cable factory in a Communist orientated suburb of Clichy. The Socialists and Communist Trade Unions were a powerful force because they defended the working class against even the moderate Right Wing of Georges Pompidou, Giscard D’Estaing and Jacques Chirac. In 1980 with the help of the Communists François Mitterrand was voted in and it seemed that although he took a pro-working stance he gave the extreme right Leader Jean Marie Le Pen the chance of openly attacking the foreigners who he said had invaded France and were preaching hatred from mosques that liberal parties had allowed to sprout with the Republican parties.
The British Isles was no different in the 1960s to the 1990s. Discrimination was rife. Coloured migrants found housing difficult to obtain if not impossible. They had to settle for derelict houses in slums just as Irish immigrants were forced into some years before.
In France, most of my workmates came from the slum housing of the North Parisian suburbs. They spoke halting French and found socialising with the French impossible. They felt no bitterness because they had been prepared to face that battle. Was this a part of Christian France I often wondered but as I moved on and the younger generation of Muslims grew to working age I realised that they were confined to the lower echelons of employment even with “proper” education. The stigma of the Holy Wars probably was in most middle and upper class people’s minds.
Soon the front running candidate in the French Election Marine Le Pen will dissect French antipathy and show how racist France can be. But then it is not just Islam against Christianity. The right-wing English and French are even against the East European accused of unfairly taking the jobs of the working class. The Polish, the Czechs, the Greeks, Romanians even the Portuguese, Spanish and Italians “are taking our jobs” they claim. Would they mind if it were the Swiss Norwegians, the Swedes and the Danes coming in? No, they don’t but the lesser Vikings; “the Latvians, Estonians Poles and Hungarians are the problem”. To these people every Sterling Pound or Euro is better value in their own countries merely because the cost of living in those countries are lower that the “rich European ones”.
If you can bang a fist on a table and shout out that the balance must be restored. Scream out that the factories of the industrial countries to be redeployed to the “homelands” you can reap in the votes. Have they any reason to believe that having done that the cost of every bolt and screw, every nail and tail will cost more when they are manufactured in England and France? “Look at Germany they will say” not realising that the “Nazis of yester year” have millions of Turkish and Pakistanis on the lines of factories and continue to call for migrants to join the work force.
Is Trump for real?
History studied carefully will tell us that the antagonists of peace are the ones have instigated “regime changes” and created breaches around the Middle East and North Africa. They toppled Sadaam Hussein on the pretext that he had Weapons of Mass Destruction, they were afraid of Ghaddafi’s influence in Africa so these men were toppled. They found it the duty of NATO to arm the “moderate” Afghanis first against the Russians and then against these very same “moderate” Afghanis who now, are the Taliban and Al Kaida and even ISIL!
Will they ever have an extreme right Government is now a question posed in every country in Europe. Yes, the US voted in a businessman who promises to “make America great again” while ignoring Media Freedom and the basic Human Rights of the First Nations – the native Americans. But then again, the other nation that presents itself as the paragon of Human Rights; Canada is no better. “Refugees and Migrants before the Natives”. Is Trump for real? He is and he will make enemies but Geminis I know don’t mind making enemies.
Europe will never ever have an elected President from the Extreme Right if the refugees of yester-year, the migrants of yesterday and the real French people.
They do want to see their own country chasing after an illusion of being a world power, just as the most unpopular French President thought he could be. All the republican parties will in the second round of the election unite to defeat Marine Le Pen again and again. It happened in Austria, now in Holland and if world war two was before my time Hitler did promise to make Germany great and he did for a while only.
