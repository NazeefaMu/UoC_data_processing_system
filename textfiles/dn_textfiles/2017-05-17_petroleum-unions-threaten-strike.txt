Petroleum unions threaten strike

 
Petroleum trade unions have said they will launch a strike if their demands are not met by May 22.
The petroleum trade unions have made three demands in relation to the Sapugaskanda Oil refinery, the China Bay Oil tanks and the proposed deal with India to develop the Trincomalee Oil tanks farm.
The strike that was launched by the petroleum trade unions last month was called off after discussions with Petroleum Resources Minister Chandima Weerakkody and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe.
