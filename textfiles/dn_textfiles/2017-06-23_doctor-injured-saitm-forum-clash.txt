Doctor injured in SAITM forum clash

A medical doctor was injured and admitted to the National Hospital yesterday evening following a clash between two groups during a forum held at the Sri Lanka Foundation Institute (SLFI) in Colombo.
The altercation had taken place following heated arguments about the South Asian Institute of Technology and Medicine (SAITM) in Malabe, sources said.
The National Hospital confirmed a doctor was admitted with injuries but refused to divulge the nature of the incident.
An official at the SLFI meanwhile confirmed that heated arguments broke out between some of the attendees during a forum on ‘Ending the SAITM crisis’ at the SLFI premises yesterday evening.
In addition to doctors, other professionals and several opposition politicians too had been present at the this forum.
A heated argument had taken place between a group of doctors opposing the SAITM and several others supporting it which had later led to the clash, sources said.
