Have a happy breakfast

Breakfast is the most important meal of the day, but preparing even a simple breakfast can seem like too much work on rushed weekday mornings.
“Science shows that morning nutrition is critical for learning, performance and behavior in school. In fact, kids who eat breakfast have better memory, attention, test scores and attendance than those who skip the morning meal,” nutritionists say.
If your kids are tired of the same-old breakfast, consider switching it up with these fast, healthy and simple breakfast recipes.
Waffle Happy Faces
Make breakfast prep a family activity by getting your kids to decorate their own waffles.
Whole grain waffles
2 to 3 tablespoons flavored nonfat Greek yogurt
Sliced fresh fruit of choice
Toast the waffle according to package directions.Top the waffle with 2 to 3 tablespoons of Greek yogurt (so the fruit sticks on).Then use your favourite fruits to decorate the waffle and create a smiley face. Anything goes—have fun with it! For example, create eyes using two slices of banana and a chocolate chip in the center; a raspberry works perfectly for the nose, and sliced kiwi fruit for the mouth.
Barely Banana Protein Pancakes
This delicious pancake recipe will provide a boost of protein.
3 eggs
1 cup oats
1cups cottage cheese
1 small ripe banana
Oil or butter for greasing the skillet
Favourite jam for serving
Put the eggs, oats, cottage cheese, and banana into a blender. Blend until the oats are pulverized, the cottage cheese is blended, and the batter is smooth.Set a skillet over medium heat. Add about a teaspoon of oil and swirl the pan to coat the bottom. Pour about 1 tablespoon of batter into the pan for each pancake. Cook until bubbles appear across the surface and the bottom is deeply brown.Use a spatula to flip the pancake and cook until firm to the touch, another 1 to 2 minutes. Serve hot out of the pan with a thin layer of jam.
Make Ahead: These pancakes are best the morning you make them, but if you have leftover batter, store it in the fridge for the next day. The batter will be quite thick, so you’ll need the aid of a spoon to spread it in the pan. Alternatively, you can thin the batter with a splash of milk.
