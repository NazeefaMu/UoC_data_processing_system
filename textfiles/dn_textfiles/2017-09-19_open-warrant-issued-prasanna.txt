Open warrant  issued on Prasanna

The Pugoda Magistrate Courts yesterday issued an open warrant against Parliamentarian Prasanna Ranatunge, former Dompe Pradeshiya Sabha Chairman Milan Jayatilake and four others for their failure to appear in Courts over their alleged involvement in damaging and obstructing vehicles transporting garbage from Colombo to the recycling plant in Dompe, Kirindiwela.
The courts also issued notice to the sureties of the accused to appear in courts.
Ranatunge and others have been charged with damaging three lorries transporting garbage and the STF jeep which was escorting the vehicles to the garbage recycling site at Dompe, Kirindiwela.
The court set the next hearing date of the case for February 26 as it plans to seek the Attorney General's advise with regards to the future proceedings of the case.
Deputy minister Dulip Wijesekera, Prasanna Ranatunge MP, Milan Jayatilake and former Dompe Pradeshiya Sabha members Tharaka Abeywickrema, Nihal Wijesena and 17 others have been cited as accused in the case. A lawyer appearing for the accused meanwhile informed court that Prasanna Ranatunge had gone overseas after obtaining permission from the High court.
The magistrate noted that she was not aware that Ranatunge had obtained permission to go abroad.
