Hambantota SEZ with China declared open

 
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe this morning together with Chinese Ambassador Yi Xianliang declared open the Special Economic Zone (SEZ) in Hambantota.
The SEZ will see USD 1.1 billion of USD 8 billion debt owed to China by Sri Lanka waived in a debt-for-equity swap negotiated by the present government.
