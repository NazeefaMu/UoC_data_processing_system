Why is the World so Passionate about Shakespeare?

As we still celebrate the 400 the death anniversary of William Shakespeare, the question asked by many is: why is he so passionately revered both as a dramatist and literature icon. No one seems to have the answer but remain in awesome at his remarkable wizadry.
The amazing language he used in dialogue, stunned the world then and now, a reason no renown writer attempted to eclipse.
Shakespeare thou art the Muse among the living and the dead. The creator of such magnificent characters that are immortalized so much so, they emerge as idols from incarnation.
Leading them is Hamlet, the Danish Prince.
Shakespeare did not simply appear from nowhere in a literary desert but on the contrary as a shooting star in the 16 the century from amidst the theatre instituted by a small group of young and educated people who had set about to make the theatre their career. His appearance on the scene threw light and illuminated the future theatre of drama and dialogue.
The universal genius he was, the works are now read and performed everywhere. He started life as the son of a glover with no more than average education at primary level that stunned the UNIVERSITY wits whom he white washed as he gained momentum on popularity, pulling the rug off from under their feet. They never recovered from that shock until they passed away.
Colossal drama
He knew how to exploit to the full the resources of contemporary theatre though sandwiched between it and classicism. One of the Chamberlain's Men, he was playwright, actor and gentleman. The spirit of England never left though he waded through many a country to set many of his plays and characters. I often wondered why he never made HAMLET the Prince of England but the Prince of Denmark in a colossal drama as this play.
In fairness to him every year some five to six thousand works about Shakespeare are published and since the end of the second world war as a virtual industry, producing books and articles on the playwright.
Shakespeare was such an extraordinary playwright unquestionably the greatest to date, He had little regard for his characters and plots that were later to become legend and every scholar to every critic was in no mood to question his authority. They accepted everything he wrote; total historical to improbabilities as well as impossibilities. He failed to portray contemporary manner and was unhampered with shakles of time. Never a historian of his time, h raced back to history to come up with a mix bag of improbabilities. Some of the strange events in his plays were censured gravely and never was possible with the time he wrote events.
But that did not matter as many thought some of his plays would not have been tolerated at the Globe. Many still wonder why he did not cast Hamlet as an Englishman or Romeo's birthplace as in York instead of Verona. These plays would have had winder appeal if they were sustained in their original sites.
But Shakespeare was different.
He was a master of his craft who was able to drive shock into heart rending tragedies and next minute turn around to create humour. Thus his characters were created to meet such situations. The horror found in his plays cannot match today's crime scenes that appear listless.
No other pen has written words that are simple and poignant that interpose history or tragedy and rise to fiery heights as the play gathers momentum. He used subtle preludes to an oncoming terror filled scene as found in many of the plays and reach a climax only to delight a director who later mounted such plays for hysterical audiences.
And who is the real Shakespeare?
How did he rise to be the world's greatest playwright?
How did he collect his colossal vocabulary?
How did he change the course of English language?
How did he influence the English literati already in existence?
And most of all, how did he survive the jeers and snobs of his contemporaries who called themselves the University-wits?
Immortal figures
No one has found the anserts to date. But I find of these solutions in the boyhood of his background in the rural setting from which he emerged; the of his time. He was a very observant youth. He trudged across valleys and dales; climbed mountain before the sun sets. His love for the forests of Arden, the swans in River Avon, etc. are bits I find in the plays. A nature man, there was nothing he missed in birds and bees nor the ever-changing four season the way composer Vivaldi had scored into his great scores. He paid much attention to his observations and the great writer who did not care to find characteristics, made them rise to immortal figures.
A historian able to illuminate the least of history plays with the inspiration of England's past by the historically minded dramatists was way out for the Bard In the approach to Shakespeare's life and works that related to the age of his time can never be during the Elizabethan period if one spends a life time trying figure it.
However, historical investigations by determined scholars have brought many things to light, especially found in the Sonnets that have baffled generations due to the careless handling of historical event by Shakespeare. Many Shakespearians feel the key to the resolution of their problem are now cleared except for his mistress. However a firm establishment of a firm chronology that took place year after year resulted in an enrichment of contemporary content that critics had been looking for. It cleared the doubts that many carried over his 'lost' years between 1587-1592 but it was also a tall order.
All the problems of the Sonnets had worked out consistently without knowing who the famous Mr. WH was could have been young Southampton. It had to be a Elizabethan historian to the circumstances and the available data to put together the results and come up finally to pin point the 'Dark Lady' often mentioned in the Sonnets.
People came to realize that the dark Rosaline in LOVS'S LABOUR LOST was inspired by the playwright's mistress.
However, was Rosaline the Dark Lady?
Once again Shakespeare gave rise to doubt. Why did he go out of his way to make HENRY VILL an exceptional play? Was it to play down Henry and Anne Boleyn as mere lay-figures and blame Henry's divorce from Catherene of Aragon and lay it on Cardinal Wolsey? Catherene being Spanish; why was she made the heroine in the play. That was in with keeping with James l's policy invented by Shakespeare seeking an alliance in order to make way for a marriage to his heir. Tactfully and prudently became the only playwright who never got into trouble. Because one third of his plays were from England, Scotland, Denmark tracing back to their rural roots and ancient collaboration of events that were sited and muddled.
But that did not matter because most people of his time were ignorant about history and paid less concerned. They were more concerned and elated about their right royal Englishman was on the way up. His plays were so colossal, spectacular and vibrant England had never seen or heard such magnificence or seen them staged. They swept aside the other playwrights who were good in their own right who had taken centre-stage before Shakespeare's rise. Some were the University-wits.
Shakespeare simply swept them to oblivion.
