‘Sri Lanka needs to take more risks’: Sanga

 
Former Sri Lanka captain Kumar Sangakkara has said Sri Lanka needs to change the way it plays.
Ahead of the ICC Champions Trophy the cricketing great said Sri Lanka must change it’s mindset to stay on par with other countries, and also take more risks.
“We have some of the more experienced players in Angelo Mathews, Chandimal. But there has to be development not just in the sense of ability but also in the sense of mindset.”
“There have quite a few change of attitudes around the world - if you take England, South Africa, even Australia, they’ve changed the way they play their one-day cricket; consciously changed, become better.”
“I think for us, we have to do the same. Because at this moment, we are playing very traditional, a tried and tested formula. That’s not going to be enough for us to win.”
“We have the ability; we have the talent – for sure. But we need to change the way we play. To be able to take more risks, to change the pace of the game, to score your runs when it’s most advantageous, to build partnerships, but also be a lot more attacking with our fast bowlers and our spinners,” the former Sri Lanka captain opined.
Kumar Sangakkara is set to make his commentary debut at the ICC Champions Trophy along with several other star players including Ricking Ponting and Saurav Ganguly.
