Sangakkara dismissed for 14 in final match for Surrey

LONDON: Kumar Sangakkara made 14 in the first innings of his final first-class game as Surrey declared on 201-8 on day one against Lancashire at Old Trafford.
The Sri Lankan, 39, who will retire at the end of the season and has hit nine centuries in 14 innings this term, was removed by Saqib Mahmood (4-50).
Sam Curran hit an unbeaten 56 before Surrey declared having just claimed their first batting point.
The hosts closed on 17-0 after seeing out the final nine overs of the day.
Second-placed Surrey began the day three points ahead of Lancashire in third place and the winners of the match will finish as runners-up to champions Essex.
Middlesex spinner Ravi Patel returned figures of 7-81 before Somerset fought back late on day one at Taunton.
Somerset, who need to win to stand a chance of staying in Division One, started well through Ed Byrom (56) and Marcus Trescothick (37).
But on a spinning pitch, Patel triggered a collapse as the hosts took just one batting point from their 236.
Jack Leach then took 2-3 as Middlesex reached stumps on 18-3, needing a further 232 runs to guarantee safety.
The away side began the day on 143 points, needing nine points to avoid the drop - a target based on Somerset (127) gaining the maximum 24 points for a win. But after the hosts took one batting point their target was reduced to five points.
Having taken all three bonus bowling points, Middlesex need to reach 250 runs in their first innings to gain two batting bonus points and take their overall total to 148 - one point more than the 147 Somerset can potentially earn from a 20-point win.
Somerset went into this relegation decider in the most perilous position following their defeat by Surrey last week and prepared a green pitch in order to take the required 20 wickets to beat fifth-placed Middlesex.
But despite winning the toss and electing to bat, their efforts were undermined by Patel, who bowled well to exploit the conditions and take career-best figures, finding prodigious turn to trap Trescothick lbw and begin the collapse from 206-4 to 236 all out.
Joe Denly dominated the Kent innings with 152 out of his team's 302 all out on day one against Glamorgan, with the visitors battling to 18-1 in the evening gloom.
Denly's vital knock, off 204 balls with 23 fours and two sixes, held his side together after they slumped to 39-4.
Lukas Carey struck twice early on, but Denly mixed caution and blazing aggression through the rest of the innings as he dragged the home team up to a respectable total, also passing 10,000 first-class runs in his career.
Joe Clarke hit an unbeaten 46 to help promotion-chasing Worcestershire recover from a bad start on a weather-hit first day against Durham.
After overnight rain ruled out a start until after lunch at New Road, Durham's pace attack of Chris Rushworth, Graham Onions and Mark Wood caused problems.
But, from 13-2, Clarke and opener Brett D'Oliveira (22) shared a nerve-settling half-century stand of 56. The hosts closed on 90-3, Clarke having so far put on 21 with George Rhodes.
Division two leaders Worcestershire, who elected to bat when play finally got under way, still need six points from this game to be sure of going up. If they beat Durham, it will almost certainly be enough to pip second-placed Notts to the title.
Third-placed Northants' game was completely washed out for the day at Leicester.
Onions is playing his final match for Durham, having announced that he will leave at the end of the season after being unable to agree a new contract. - AFP
