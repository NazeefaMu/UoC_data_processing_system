Yasas Abeywickrama elected SEARCC President

President of the Computer Society of Sri Lanka, Yasas V. Abeywickrama has been elected as the President of the South East Asia Regional Computer Confederation (SEARCC).
SEARCC is a forum of national Information Technology professional societies in the Asia Pacific region. It was started in 1978 and it aspires to be the key collaborative body for National ICT professional associations in the Asia Pacific region, helping its’ members and the ICT industry in the region to prosper and grow.
SEARCC/NITC 2017 conference recently concluded in Colombo which combined the regional SEARCC conference drawing delegates from across Asia, the Pacific and Europe together with the annual National IT Conference (NITC) for Sri Lanka. As is customary, the conference concluded with the transfer of the Presidency to the SEARCC member society hosting the conference. The next SEARCC conference will be hosted by the Computer Society of India (CSI) in 2018.
The concept of a regional computer confederation grew out of the first regional computer conference held in Singapore in September 1976 under the auspices of the International Federation for Information Processing and implemented by the Singapore Computer Society.
The Charter and Constitution of SEARCC was signed in Singapore on February 28, 1978. Six national societies from the region, the Hong Kong Computer Society, Indonesian Computer Society, Malaysian National Computer Confederation, Philippines Computer Society, Singapore Computer Society and Computer Association of Thailand were the founding signatories.
Australian Computer Society (ACS), Computer Society of Republic of China (CSROC), Computer Society of India (CSI), South Pacific Computer Society (SPaCS), Malaysian National Computer Confederation (MNCC), Papua New Guinea, are also among the SEARCC Executive Committee members. SEARCC, today, is the leading confederation of IT professionals throughout the region.
