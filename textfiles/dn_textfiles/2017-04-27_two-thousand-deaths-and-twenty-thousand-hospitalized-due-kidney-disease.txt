Two-thousand deaths and twenty thousand hospitalized due to kidney disease

 
Health Minister Rajitha Senaratne has said that according to the latest health statistics, annually about 20,000 Sri Lankans are hospitalized and around 2000 die due to various kidney diseases.
The Minister expressed these views during a recent ceremony held in Colombo.
According to Minister Senaratne, the number of patients who suffer from Chronic Kidney Disease of Unknown Origin (CKDU) is around 38,000.
Around 4000 CKDU patients were reported from Anuradhapura and Polonnaruwa districts along during the past four years.
Minister Senaratne pointed out that researching on CKDU commenced in 2008 and the Presidential task Force set up in 2014.
Malnutrition and Anemia are two common health issues among kidney patients.
The lives of kidney patients can be uplifted through correct nutrition.
This is proved scientifically. Plans are now being made to recruit 300 nutritionists to the Health Ministry soon.
The country needs more nutritionists in order t look after the health of kidney patients and the food habits of all patients who suffer from Non Communicable Diseases (NCDs), he added.
