Entertaining and engaging

The story being ‘Bogan’ begins with Vikram (Jayam Ravi), a dare devil Assistant Commissioner of Police (ACP), taking on the goons with his colleagues, Sathya (Varun), Prasad (Nagendra Prasad) and Akshara (Akshara Gowda). Vikram’s family fixes his marriage with Mahalakshmi or Maha (Hansika), whom he meets on a road drunk, to avoid getting married to an unknown person. When she realizes how good Vikram is, she agrees for the marriage.
Their engagement takes place. At the same time, the film introduces Aditya (Arvind Swami), who is having a whale of a life with foreign girls and drinks for company. Aditya uses his special power and at first he mesmerizes a jewelry shop manager and loots the money from the shop and then mesmerizes Vikram’s father (‘Aadukalam’ Naren), who is working as a Bank Manager and loots the money from the bank, where he works.
Vikram’s father gets arrested and he is unable to do anything. To rescue his father, Vikram starts investigating the way the money was stolen from both the places and finds out they were all done by Aditya, who has become rich in the last six months through dubious means.
The film belongs to Arvind Swamy who dominates as Aditya from the beginning to end. His mannerisms, style and casual attitude gives credibility to the character and he seems to be enjoying his role every minute. After Thani Oruvan, Bogan is his career best. Even when Jayam Ravi acts with Arvind Swamy’s soul, the impact of Arvind Swamy can be felt in those scenes.
