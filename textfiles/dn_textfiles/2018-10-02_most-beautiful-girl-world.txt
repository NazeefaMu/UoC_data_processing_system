Most beautiful girl in the world?

Five-year-old Jare, from Nigeria, has set the internet on fire with her striking looks and has been crowned the ‘most beautiful girl in the world.’ Her photos have put people into a frenzy over her smooth, un-photoshopped skin and luxurious hair, with comments about how “absolutely stunning” and “doll-like” she is.
Jare’s new fame is thanks to lifestyle-and-wedding photographer, Mofe Bamuyiwa, who captured and shared three portraits of the girl on social media for a project, writing “Oh yes she’s human! She’s also an angel! ‘J A R E ‘.”

It features not only Jare, but her other two equally photogenic sisters Jomi, 7, and Joba, 10. So far their account ‘the_j3_sisters‘ has an impressive 21.6k followers.The Nigerian beauty is only the most recent ‘most beautiful girl in the world’, Anna Pavaga, 8, was given the title past December after successfully beginning a modeling career at only three-years-old.
