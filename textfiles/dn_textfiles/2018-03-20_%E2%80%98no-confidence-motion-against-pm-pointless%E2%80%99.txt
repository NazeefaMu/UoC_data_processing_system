‘No Confidence Motion against PM is pointless’

No point of bringing in a No Confidence Motion against the Prime Minister, Government Medical Officers’ Association (GMOA) Assistant Secretary Dr. Navin De Soyza said.
He was addressing the media personnel during a press conference held in Colombo yesterday evening. Dr. Soyza said a No Confidence Motion should be brought in against all 225 Parliamentarians and not only against the Prime Minister. Parliament is full of uneducated persons. They cannot take the country forward, Dr. Soyza said.
Sri Lanka is another developing country even after 70 years of its independence thanks to our politicians, while other countries have well developed their resources empowering their citizens, he said.
