Robinson Crusoe : Unimaginative

Daniel Defoe’s ‘Robinson Crusoe’ is about the triumph of the human spirit. However the 2016 Belgian-French 3D computer-animated adventure comedy directed by Vincent Kesteloot and Ben Stassen does not embody this essence.
Published in 1719, the novel ‘Robinson Crusoe’ was an instant best-seller, and ran through many editions. The book has lived for 297 years with no fallow period where it dropped into obscurity. This is an incredible feat for any novel. The book has sparked conversation and argument for centuries. Kesteloot and Stassen’s production is a loose adaption of the tale.
Targeted at children, especially pre schoolers, the movie includes plenty of colourful animals: dog, cats, a macaw and even an armadillo. No wonder it is titled ‘The Wild Life’ and released in some parts of the world.
Exotic island
The story is narrated from the animal’s perspective rather than that of the lead role. Robinson Crusoe’s larger-than-life parrot voices the tale of the shipwrecked adventurer. His bird is not like your regular parakeet but dreams of exploring the world outside his exotic island. Named Tuesday, the brightly plumed macaw also attempts to fend off repeated attacks by a pair of nasty wildcats and their mangy litter.
The storyline does not hold much depth. A castaway finds himself on a tiny island with no other human inhabitants, after a rough start, he befriends the local animals and all hell breaks loose when the killer kittens enter the picture. Before Crusoe’s arrival, the island is an untouched paradise. The animals live together, gather food together, and get each other out of scrapes. The leader is Mak, a colorful parrot who senses a wide world is out there beyond the ocean and he wants to see it.
Everything about the film is pedestrian. There is nothing imaginative about it. At the same time there is nothing intelligent and interesting about the tale. The worse part is that there is nothing funny about it either. Even the animation in the movie is almost amateurish. The film also tries to pack in a little bit too much in its running time.
Skilled hands
The cats’ urge to dominate the island is a bit of a bore. This leads to a gigantic group fight later in the film. Crusoe’s animal-friends against the cat-couple’s endless offspring could have been played out better in more skilled hands.
Some of the colours used to paint the animals makes it a pretty picture to watch but that is probably the only positive element in the movie. Tiny tots might be amused with the tale but adults will find the story bland and the jokes weak. It is always a great shock when a production based on a beloved tale falls short of its mark but it remains badly told.
Robinson Crusoe is screening at Majestic Cineplex, Empire Arcade and Savoy 3D cinema.
