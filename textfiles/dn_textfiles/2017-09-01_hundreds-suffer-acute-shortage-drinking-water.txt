Hundreds suffer from acute shortage of drinking water

The residents of Bogahapelessa, Kavantissagama, Julepallama, Samaguliya, Siyambalagaswewa and Mahasenpura undergo untold hardships due to the acute shortage of drinking water for several years.
Residents in these villages said they do not get pipe born water from the Kataragama branch of the National Water Supply and Drainage Board during the months of July, August, September and October.
Residents said water is being distributed every now and then by bowsers but those who live in the interior of these villages do not get water from bowsers because bowsers cannot reach them due to the dilapidated condition of roads.
