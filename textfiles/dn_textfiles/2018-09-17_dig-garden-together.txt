Dig the garden together

Whether you have an acre of land or a few pots on a balcony, plant a family garden: You’ll all live healthier! Gardening is an easy activity to share and you’ll harvest benefits along with your fresh vegetables, colorful flowers, and aromatic herbs. Even better, you don’t have to wait for your plants to bloom to see those benefits. When parents and kids work together to plant and care for a garden, they can all enjoy these perks.
Physical Activity
Gardening and yard work are moderate-intensity exercises, which we all need every day (for at least 30 minutes). While tending your family garden doesn’t require the vigorous activity it’s still beneficial to your body. Gardening incorporates fine-motor skill strengthening and stretching.
Lower Stress, Better Mood
Gardening is excellent stress relief for a combination of fascinating reasons: exposure to fresh air and sunlight, relaxing and repetitive tasks, and even contact with harmless bacteria in the soil that helps release serotonin in the brain.
Outdoor Time
Children are prone to spending a lot of time indoors, which can negatively affect their behavior and health. A family garden gets them outside enjoying and experiencing the natural world.
Better Sleep
All of the above (physical activity, reduced stress, being outside) can contribute to more and better sleep for everyone. And better sleep, in turn, can improve kids’ behavior and performance at school.
Healthier Eating
Kids who grow vegetables eat vegetables—or at least, they are more willing to taste unfamiliar veggies, which is the first step to incorporating those new flavours into their diet.
Family Time
Planning, sowing, and tending a family garden offers physical activity with a purpose shared by everyone. It helps teach kids responsibility and gives them a sense of accomplishment. It gives all of you a project to work on—and enjoy—together, which reinforces your family bond.
Family Garden Chores for Kids
Kids can do a lot of the work for your family garden, either independently or alongside an adult. While you don’t want them to burn out on tedious tasks like weeding, taking responsibility is part of what makes a family garden meaningful. Set a goal, such as clearing one small, designated area or working for 15 minutes then do something else.
