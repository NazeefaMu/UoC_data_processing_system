Human elephant conflict intensified in Hambantota

As a result of clearing forest reserves in Hambantota beyond limits, elephants are being deprived of elephant corridors. It was these elephants that were transferred to the Horowpathana elephant
protection centre.
The wildlife officials at Hambantota said that only hardcore elephants that possess strong genes are sent to the Horowpathana elephant protection center. These elephants are those who
are considered hardcore ones. To increase the strong elephant population there should be enough she elephants at the Horowpathana center for the hardcore elephants. According to sources at the Horowpathana centre, there are only two she elephants at this center at the moment.
The Horowpathana centre is now similar to a prison for hardcore elephants as some of them transferred to this center die of attacks by other elephants, the sources said.
