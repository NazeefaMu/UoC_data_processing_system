‘Private hospital fees will be regulated’

Charges of 46 services at private hospitals will be regulated very soon, Health Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne said.
He was speaking at the Kalutara District meeting of the All island Private Pharmacy Owners’ Association recently.
Minister Senaratne said that when people see the bills issued by some private hospitals, they get heart attacks.
He said prices of 25 drugs including cancer drugs will be reduced before long. The All island Private Pharmacy Owners’ Association does not charge people unreasonably while private pharmacies earn profit, he said.
Minister Senaratne said the cap on the limit of funds that the State spends on cancer patients was lifted and earlier it was Rs. 1.5 million. “The government now spend around Rs. 450 million on a cancer patient. The health sector has received 43 private sector investments, the Minister said.
High prices of 48 drugs were slashed in the past and that immensely benefited the public. The National drug Policy was introduced after discussing it for over four decades.
