Siddhalepa Group in LMDs’ Most Respected Edition for  sixth year

The Hettigoda Group made it to the LMD’s prestigious special edition on Most Respected Companies for the sixth consecutive year, cementing their position as a market leader in Ayurveda Pharmaceuticals and Ayurveda based tourism.
The company established by Deshabandu, Dr. Victor Hettigoda, has achieved market leadership from a home grown ayurveda products manufacturer, championed by their signature brand Siddhalepa Balm and has maintained its ranking in an arena dominated by top blue chip conglomerates and multinational entities.
The ratings were based on; financial performance, quality consciousness, management profile, honesty, innovation, dynamism, corporate culture, CSR, Vision and National Mindedness and the Hettigoda Group won both a gold and silver this year.
The group’s phenomenal success as an Ayurveda product manufacturer, and its business expansion using Ayurveda to promote medical tourism can be attributed to the vision, entrepreneurship and innovation of its founder, Dr. Hettigoda, known today as the Father of Ayurveda, whose pioneering efforts have brought the concept of Ayurveda from its roots in the villages to the heart of the city and transformed it into a global commodity.
Siddhalepa Group uses local plantation raw material, local and imported herbs and 100 natural products for their range of Ayurveda Health Products, cosmetics and dental products. In a world of changing consumer demands Siddhalepa capitalized on using pure natural and herbal ingredients with no chemicals in their range of bath, cosmetics and detergents challenging and eventually compelling even the FMCGs to add herbal ingredients to their mass produced consumer products. Good examples are top dental care brands and washing powders that has added herbal varieties to their range. Similarly with a vision far beyond his time, Dr. Hettigoda introduced the concept of medical tourism to Sri Lanka with Siddhalepa Ayurveda Resort Hotel in Wadduwa, built over 30 years ago and supported by the Group’s Ayurveda Hospital in Mount Lavinia. Siddhalepa Group operates Ayurveda Centres in both their resort and city hotel and also in Ward Place, Colombo 7 and was the first company to open an Ayurveda Centre at the Colombo International Airport Lounge which they still operate. The group also operates Ayurveda Spas in some key European cities.
The award is also a salutation to its legendary founder and Chairman, Dr. Hettigoda whose has steered Siddhalepa from a small home grown Ayurveda Enterprise to a leading Ayurveda Based Brand in the Country, with Ayurveda Centres in Europe.
“We have implemented systems to introduce new products every year, to give back part of our wealth for the welfare of the community and educate youth on social values, MD, Hettigoda Group, Asoka Hettigoda says in the Q and A on the company in the Special Edition.
“We are honoured to be ranked among the Most Respected entities and consider this recognition as an impetus for growth. We hope to maintain this stature as we continue our growth to reach the pinnacle of success,” he added.
Apart from product innovation and business expansion, the Group was recognized for its corporate governance and its significant contribution to environment protection and its green mission.
The company was initiating and promoting Corporate Social Responsibility activity at a time when the word was not even yet coined. The best examples of CSR is at religious sites, where the group set up First Aid Camps to relieve weary devotees with Siddhalepa massages and serve their refreshing herbal hot drink, Lak Peyawa. Other activities like branded name board signs, branded litter bins and send out a strong message about the Group’s commitment in keeping the environment clean.
