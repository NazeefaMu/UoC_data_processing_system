Suspects cornered amid police raid in Paris suburb, official says

A number of suspects are holed up in a building amid a major police operation in the Paris suburb of Saint-Denis, officials say, as the hunt continues for people believed to be involved in the deadly terrorist attacks that rocked the French capital five days ago.
 
Latest developments:
• 1:32 a.m. ET: A series of explosions is heard in the area. It wasn't immediately clear whether the blasts were controlled explosions carried out by authorities.
 
• 12:39 a.m. ET: An unspecified number of suspects have been cornered in a building in the Paris suburb of Saint-Denis, Mayor Didier Paillard said in an interview on French television early Wednesday.
 
• Police and soldiers have cordoned off the zone and all public transportation in the area has been halted.
 
• The operation is related to the search for suspects in the Paris attacks, police say.
 
Full story:
Witnesses have reported gunfire amid a police raid in the northern Paris suburb of Saint-Denis as authorities hunt for two suspects from Friday's deadly terrorist attacks who are believed to be at large.
 
Police blocked off roads early Wednesday in Saint-Denis, which is home to the Stade de France sports stadium where three suicide bombings took place Friday.
 
CNN affiliate BFMTV reported that police officers have been wounded by gunfire during a raid seeking one of the suspects in the wave of violence across Paris, which killed at least 129 people and wounded hundreds more.
 
French police wouldn't comment on whether any officers had been shot in the Saint-Denis operation.
 
BFMTV reported that the police raid was linked to the hunt for the so-called "ninth suspect," who may appear in a video recorded by a witness to the attacks.
 
Police have been analyzing the video, which shows two gunmen inside a black car linked to the attacks and perhaps a third individual driving the car, French media reported.
 
Seven of the attackers were killed during the wave of violence Friday night, and an international arrest warrant is already out for one suspect, Salah Abdeslam, a 26-year-old Frenchman. The identity of the possible ninth suspect is unknown. (CNN)
