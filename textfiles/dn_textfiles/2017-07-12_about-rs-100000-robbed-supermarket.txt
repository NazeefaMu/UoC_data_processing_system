About Rs. 100,000 robbed from supermarket

A special investigation was launched by Welikada Police to arrest two suspects involved in robbing nearly Rs. 100,000 from a supermarket at Sri Jayawardenapura Road, Rajagiriya.
According to Welikada Police, the suspects had threatened employees of the supermarket at gunpoint and taken away the money from the cashier.
It was revealed that the suspects had come wearing full face helmets and jackets, armed with knives and pistols.
The suspects had not been able to open the drawers at the time. Therefore, they had removed four cash register machines in the supermarket by force.
The manager of the supermarket had removed all the money collected on the day from the cash register machines. The suspects did not have the opportunity to take a large amount of money, Welikada Police said.
The video footage of the robbery was recorded on the CCTV cameras fixed at the supermarket. It was found that the suspects had committed this robbery within two and half minutes.
Welikada Police are investigating.
