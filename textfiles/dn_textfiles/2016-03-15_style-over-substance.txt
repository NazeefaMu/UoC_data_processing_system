Style over substance

 
Chiseled and handsome men, buxom and obedient women, scary monsters and opulent palaces are in abundant throughout Alex Proyas' ‘Gods of Egypt’.
The story is simple but too many subplots make it complicated. Bek, a thief with a ‘heart of gold’, doubts the nobility of the Gods. Despite the fact that they are 12 feet tall, bleed gold, and transform into humanoid beasts in combat he is fearless towards them because they resemble humans in appearance. Meantime celebrations are underway since God Osiris will be passing his crown as King of Egypt to his son Horus.
This does not sit well with Osiris' brother, Set. He attacks the coronation and as a result Osiris is killed and Horus is blinded and banished. The people of Egypt become slaves under their new king and Bek sees Horus as the only way they could be freed from tyranny. Backed by his partner, Zaya, Bek hatches a plan to restore Horus’ sight and help him take over leadership.
Another noteworthy factor about Gods of Egypt is that the movie does not shy away from borrowing from other ancient epics. Ancient mythology is moulded to fit the structure of a contemporary superhero framework. This is evident in the manner the Gods transform themselves to resemble something between Ironman and the Transformers.
Ancient epics
The Gods are reduced to a level in which they resemble snobbish brats as they fight over the fact that who gets to control Egypt.
The stunt choreography fails to impress. They look like they were pulled out of a video game, and not a good one. The shots are cut rapidly and one almost wonders if Proyas too decided that nothing interesting has been captured on film so that it is best to wrap up the episodes.
There are a few instances when the movie entertains. However style overcomes substance and logic at times. The CGI just isn’t that good. Digital effects get a bad rap when compared to practical effects.
Entertaining diversion
Though Nikolaj Coster-Waldau isn’t likely to be the latest action hero, he carries the film off as well as he could have possibly managed. Chadwick Boseman is an entertaining diversion as Thoth the god of wisdom, and Gerard Butler too does well as the villain. Brenton Thwaites is not significant in his role.
Compared with the male roles the women have been shabbily treated in ‘Gods of Egypt’. Courtney Eaton exists solely to be a damsel in distress. Elodie Yung, as the goddess of love, Hathor, hardly has anything interesting to do. Both exist more to give the story a go ahead rather than add any substance to the tale.
Despite making creative movies like ‘The Crow’ and ‘Dark City’ in the 1990s Proyas’ latest addition to the cinema scene has not got anything new to offer. If you are a diehard fan of the ‘Clash of the Titans’ style of movie genre, then this might be your cup of tea. Otherwise this will get more yawns rather than laughs out of you.
