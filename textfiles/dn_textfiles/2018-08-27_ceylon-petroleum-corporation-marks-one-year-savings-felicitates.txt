CEYLON PETROLEUM CORPORATION MARKS ONE YEAR OF SAVINGS, FELICITATES LONGSTANDING EMPLOYEES

The Ceylon Petroleum Corporation (CPC) felicitated 73 of its employees who completed 25 years of service, in the presence of President, Maithripala Sirisena and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe at a ceremony which also marked a year since the new management of CPC took administrative control of the entity.
CPC has made significant headway in the past one year in terms of reforming the institution to curtail losses and fortify Sri Lanka’s energy sector. Under the new directive of Minister of Petroleum Resources Development, Arjuna Ranatunga, Dammika Ranatunga, Chairman of the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation, and the Management of CPC, the institution has been successful in achieving record savings throughout its operation, despite several external factors.
When the new management took over operations at CPC in May 2017, the budgeted loss for the year was estimated at Rs. 14.5 billion, but through a series of strategic initiatives and aggressive measures, CPC recorded a profit of Rs. 1.57 billion, resulting in a saving of Rs. 16.07 billion in just seven months.
This turnaround came despite a challenging external environment due to the depreciating value of the rupee, rising global fuel prices and sudden changes to Dollar Loan interest rates.
In the past year, the management of CPC and Ceylon Petroleum Storage Terminals Limited (CPSTL) have drastically changed several internal processes and revamped nation-wide infrastructure to increase savings and productivity, strengthen national energy security, improve quality and support national industries.
A zero-based budgeting process was introduced to promote more fiscal discipline, reducing expenditure and being stricter on the negotiation of interest rates on loans, enabling better management of debt. Within this period, CPC was able to record Rs. 11 billion in interest earnings due to improved treasury controls leading to better working capital management when dealing with banks. This was a 30% increase from the previous year’s Rs. 8.3 billion in interest earnings.
In addition, CPC for the first time in 50 years, comprehensively re-evaluated assets spread throughout the country in an inventory control digitisation initiative, which led to CPC’s balance sheet gaining Rs. 10.2 billion from the inclusion of the value of its assets valued during the programme. This enabled CPC to gain more preferential rates when acquiring loans for operations.
“It has been a year of transformation. We have taken many steps to ensure a secure, high quality national fuel supply while managing many challenges both externally and internally. Our priority is always to work in the best interest of the people, even over profits sometimes. Everyone at the Ministry of Petroleum Resources, CPC and CPSTL have worked incredibly hard to revamp essential infrastructure, introduce new products, bolster support to vital industries and better manage financials so the gains can be passed down to the public. We have recorded significant savings in just one year and we will continue to pursue further progress, which will contribute to the nation’s journey forward”, said Arjuna Ranatunga, Minister of Petroleum Resources Development, speaking at a recent press briefing.
Dammika Ranatunga, Chairman, Ceylon Petroleum Corporate, said, “Under the directive of the Ministry of Petroleum Resources Development together with the Management of CPC, the Management of CPSTL and everyone working in these institutions, we have overcome a variety of odds during this first year.We have had to take several stringent measures to curtail losses and increase savings without passing that burden onto the public. In addition, we had to completely re-evaluate many internal processes which were stifling the progress of CPC and threatening the national fuel supply. Our key areas of focus were increasing savings and productivity, improving the quality of fuel we provide and strengthening energy security while increasingly supporting SMES and vital industries.We have thus far been successful due to a number of key projects and initiatives that we have launched and in some cases, completed, within this short time frame of just one year. This is just the beginning. There are several projects that are in progress and in the pipeline that will benefit the country, and we are steadfast in our effort to reform CPC and transform the nation’s energy sector.”
