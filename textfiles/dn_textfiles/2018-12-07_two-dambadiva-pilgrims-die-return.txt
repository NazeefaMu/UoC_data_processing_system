Two Dambadiva pilgrims die on return

Two of four pilgrims who visited Dambadiva had been hospitalised a week after their return on Tuesday and Wednesday.
Doctors suspect they may have contracted a virus in India. A postmortem was to be held at the Matara and Deniyaya Hospitals, yesterday. All of them had similar symptoms when they were admitted.
A group of 38 pilgrims from Deniyaya, Matara, returned after their two-week pilgrimage on November 25. The deceased were identified as 67-year-old P. Jane Nona and 81-year-old R.M. Somawathie.
