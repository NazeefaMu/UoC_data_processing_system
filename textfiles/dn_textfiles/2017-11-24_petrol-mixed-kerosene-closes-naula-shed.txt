Petrol mixed with kerosene closes Naula shed

The Cooperative filling station in Naula is alleged to have been selling petrol mixed with kerosene.
The vehicle owners claimed that the particular fuel station distributed petrol mixed kerosene. One of the vehicle owners speaking to the Daily News said that his petrol smelled kerosene. Cooperative Association officials present at the scene said that they will launch an investigation over the issue.The officials tested the petrol but could not arrive at a conclusion. A person who claimed to be the manager of the particular fuel station, demanded the vehicle owners to prove their allegations.
He said that that they received fuel from the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation and added that the vehicle owners should question the Petroleum Corporation and not the fuel station. Vehicles owners also complained to the Naula police about the issue and the police officers who checked the petrol said that it smelled kerosene. The police informed the manager of the fuel station to temporarily stop distribution of petrol and assured the vehicle owners that an investigation will be conducted.
