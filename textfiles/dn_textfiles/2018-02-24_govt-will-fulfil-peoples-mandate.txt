PM tells group of ministers, deputy ministers:
Govt. will fulfil people's mandate

Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said the government will focus on the amendments that need to be brought in while working within the mandate given to it by the people.
He stressed that they needed to work within the mandate given to them by the people and discuss the type of amendments that need to be brought in, the speed in which they have to be implemented, look at their mistakes and shortcomings and plan what action needs to be taken immediately.
“We need to focus on the Local Government election results, correct our mistakes and shortcomings and take steps to fulfil the aspirations of the people,” the Prime Minister said.
The Prime Minister, made these observations after a meeting at Temple Trees yesterday, with a team of UNP ministers and deputy ministers to discuss the way forward for the country and look at what needs to be done during the tenure of the government.
He asked that the team hand in a report of suggestions and ideas of the projects that need to be implemented and the initiatives taken.
Ministers Sajith Premadasa, Harin Fernando, Akila Viraj Kariyawasam, Naveen Dissanayake and Sagala Ratnayaka and Deputy Ministers Harsha de Silva and Ajith P. Perera and State Minister Eran Wickremaratne were present at the discussions held at Temple Trees.
“The Local Government election results have clearly shown that the public is not pleased with the programme that we have implemented so far. In many countries around the world, such elections are held to feel the pulse of the people.
To see whether the people support the government’s programme or not,” Prime Minister Wickremesinghe observed.
“It is not that we have done nothing with our time but that we cannot be satisfied with the speed of implementation of our programmes whilst other plans have had issues,” the Prime Minister added.
The meeting not only discussed the future course of action of the government but also that of the United National Party. The Prime Minister further noted that as they successfully take forward the programmes of the government, within the UNP, they were committed to create a new generation of leaders.
This generation of leaders would be among the ministers, Members of Parliament, Local Government members as well as within the party membership itself, he said.
“I have brought you all together here to discuss whether we should embark on a radical path in future”, the Prime Minister said.
“Traditionally, this reform process is done by the Seniors, the Prime Minister noted but this time, as they were going to create a new generation of leaders, “I have entrusted the duty of putting forward suggestions for reform to you, you who will take the party forward in future”.
“This is just a part of the new journey the UNP will take, the Premier added and promised to appoint a team to look into the party restructuring process next week.
“I hope to complete the process within a month”, the Premier added.
The Prime Minister also explained that he would discuss the report put forward by the ministers with the President and other ministers and take action thereafter.
“This is an important step towards reform, the Prime Minister stressed.
