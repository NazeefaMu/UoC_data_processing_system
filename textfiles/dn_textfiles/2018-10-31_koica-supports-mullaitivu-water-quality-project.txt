KOICA supports Mullaitivu water quality project

The completion of the second stage of water quality enhancement project was celebrated in Maritimepattu in the Mullaitivu District on October 25.
This is a three-year project which is being conducted by Lamp INGO and funded by KOICA for villagers in the Maritimepattu Division where some people are suffering from Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD).
The ceremony was attended by KOICA Country Director Lee Dong Ku, Mullaitivu District Secretary Ketheeswaran, Lamp INGO Sri Lanka head officer Seo Jin Tae and International Manager Ahn Tae Ju and the villagers who will be provided with safe drinking water.
The main drinking water for the villagers was obtained from ground-water wells which are contaminated with agricultural chemicals and fertilizer, which was the main reason for the cause of water-borne diseases and CKD.
However, with the 60m deep well, operated by Lamp INGO, the people will be able to get safe drinking water at a low cost. Furthermore, a resident autonomy committee has been organised and will carry out action to maintain the water facility effectively.
Ketheeswaran said: “This town was affected by the war, so people are in need of many things to sustain their lives. I would like to thank Lamp INGO for giving us the prerequisite, water. We will make sure that the facility is managed well so that the people can have a better life.
I also want to specially thank KOICA, which made the project happen.”
Lee said: “Safe drinking water is essential for a healthy life. Pregnant women, the elderly, and infants with weak immunity in particular need safe drinking water.”
KOICA Sri Lanka office places high priority on development projects in the Northern and Eastern Provinces.
KOICA in cooperation with WFP supports increasing resilience to drought by establishing community and household water harvesting systems and recently, KOICA also signed a multi-year partnership with UNICEF for the Kilinochchi district to provide better educational opportunities for young people.
