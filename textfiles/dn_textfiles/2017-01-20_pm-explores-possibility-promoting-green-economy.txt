PM explores possibility of promoting green economy

Obtaining expertise for the preparation of a Green Economy and a Green Fiscal Environment in Sri Lanka figured at the discussions Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe had with United Nations Environment Programme Director Erik Solheim on the sideline of the World Economic Forum held in Daros, Switzerland.
A press release by the Prime Minister’s office said views were also exchanged regarding a reforestation programme to be undertaken in Sri Lanka. Prime Minister Wickremesinghe said when forest lands were cleared for development projects, it should be mandatory to compensate such land with a reforestation programme. Erik Soheim said the UN Environment Programme could provide assistance and advise in this regard.
Attention was also drawn during the discussion for the conservation of elephants, sharks and dolphins. They also identified water and soil conservation as two issues needing urgent attention.
It was also decided to appoint a team of Sri Lankan representatives to study the areas subject to discussion at these talks and prepare plans.
Sri Lanka’s Ambassador to Geneva Ravinatha Ariyasinghe and Prime Minister’s Additional Secretary Saman Athaudahetty also attended the discussions.
