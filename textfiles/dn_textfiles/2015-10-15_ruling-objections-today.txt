Ruling on objections today

The Presidential Commission of Inquiry into mass scale fraud and corruption suspended its sittings till today pending a ruling on the objections raised by the Counsel who appeared for former President Mahinda Rajapaksa.
The former President was summoned before the Commission to obtain a statement from him over five allegations including the financial loses to Independent Television Network for televising advertisements in support of him at the last presidential election.
Rajapaksa arrived at the Commission at the BMICH yesterday morning. Defence Counsel Gamini Marapone appearing for the former President raised objections that serving judges of the High Court cannot be appointed to function as members of the Commission.
Although a ruling on Marapone's objection was due to be delivered during yesterday's sittings, Commission Chairman High Court Judge Preethi Padman Surasena postponed the order for today.
Counsel Marapone made three more objections on behalf of the former President in addition to the main objection.
Former President Rajapaksa's counsel Gamini Marapone objected to make a statement at the Presidential Commission of Inquiry Investigating into Mass Scale Corruption and Frauds which was headed by a Colombo High Court Judge since High Court Judges have no power to involve themselves in the activities of other Commissions outside their courts activities.
Thereafter, Senior State Counsel Janaka Bandara also submitted counter objections to the Commission . The Commission after considering the submissions adjourned sittings for 20 minutes.
When the Commission resumed sittings after 20 minutes interval, Commission Chairman High Court Judge Preethi Padman Surasena announced that the Commission decided to put off the verdict for today.
