Delimitation Review Committee report will be handed over to be gazetted: Faiszer

Local Government and Provincial Councils Minister Faiszer Musthapha said he would hand over the report of the Delimitation Review Committee today to be printed and Gazetted.
He made this observation while addressing a press conference at the SLFP Headquarters yesterday. He said the rest of the legal requirements to hold the LG elections, such as publishing in the Gazette, the number of LG members and Amendments to the LG Act, would also be done as soon as possible.
He said a Committee headed by Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe and comprising representatives of all parties was looking at the Amendments needed to the Act. He pointed out that several minor political parties had submitted their proposals to this Committee. Minister Musthapha also thanked the Chairman of the Elections Commission for his support to fix the problems in the Delimitation report. “Delimitation Review Committee Chairman Asoka Peiris did not immediately respond to our requests to fix the errors in the report. However, the Elections Commission Chairman came between us and resolved the issues in the report,” he said.
