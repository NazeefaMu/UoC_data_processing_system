All That Jazz Sundays

A magic portion of soulful jazz and gastronomic symphonies is the ideal antidote for relaxation of a Sunday afternoon, swathed in the tranquility that emanates from the central courtyard of Chapter One.
Imbibe the iconic notes of trumpet stoking Miles Davies, Charlie Parker’s extraordinary chordal improvisations or be influenced by John Coltrane’s unique style that musicians even today find difficult to emulate - Ravel Crake and Friends will give you all this and more. Being at Chapter One on a Sunday afternoon, enjoying high spirits and tapping your feet to a great saxophone solo should surely be on the ‘To Do’ list for a weekend.
Embracing the rustic minimalism that forms the core characteristic of Chapter One, the exciting contemporary features including an open kitchen which transforms simple delicacies into a gastronomic journey compliments the Sunday Jazz delights. Chapter One Owner and Managing Director Chamila Samarakkodi, a jazz aficionado and musician himself, is enthusiastic about his Sunday Jazz Club. “Whether it’s hardcore jazz or jazz blues, New Orleans Jazz or cool jazz, hard bop or smooth jazz, this is a genre of music that everyone can relate to and enjoy, given that it has a little bit of every continent, whether American, African, Latin and now even fusion jazz which integrates eastern improvisations into contemporary jazz. For me, it’s all about drawing on different and diverse cultures and making music which surely is the universal language and it’s a language that Sri Lankans, who are inherently musical, will enjoy”, he stated in a release.
But it’s not just ‘All that jazz’ at Chapter One. Prepare for a gourmet revolution when entering those portals created to present gastronomic journeys. The restaurant prides itself on its curated menus and knowledgeable yet unobtrusive service, which makes it the ideal location for celebratory events including birthdays and anniversaries or corporate functions which could range from small meetings, brainstorming and even intimate cocktails and receptions.
“Chapter One is about exceeding people’s expectations with not only unparalleled levels of quality but also presenting innovative exciting options as food for the body and food for the soul. Our Jazz Club is just one such exciting feature that you will see at Chapter One. And let me tell you that music has never tasted so good as it will on a Sunday here at Chapter One, so to immortalize The Bard further, ‘If music be the food of love, play on’”, Samarakkodi adds.
