SLMC: GMOA writes to President

The Government Medical Officers’ Association (GMOA) has written to the President requesting him to intervene immediately to save the Sri Lanka Medical Council (SLMC), GMOA Secretary Dr. Haritha Aluthge said.
Addressing a press conference held at the GMOA headquarters in Colombo yesterday, he said that Health Minister plans to issue an extraordinary gazette notification and dissolve the SLMC and set up a competent authority which obeys him.
This will destroy the entire health sector of Sri Lanka as well as its future.
According to Dr. Aluthge, the Health Ministry is trying to dissolve the SLMC because the SLMC bravely decided not to allow registration of foreign MBBS degree holders who did not obtain relevant qualifications to practice as doctors in Sri Lanka, does not recognize foreign MBBS doctors who did not obtain relevant qualifications according to the requirements of their own country and does not support registration of SAITM students who do not have basic educational qualifications.
Dr. Aluthge said that the GMOA will launch the biggest-ever struggle in the Sri Lankan history against this conspiracy along with the support of all trade unions, parents’ unions, patients’ unions, and university students. The Health Minister is supported by Prof. Colvin Gunaratne and certain NGO henchmen who depend on foreign dollars and who promoted SAITM, the GMOA said.
