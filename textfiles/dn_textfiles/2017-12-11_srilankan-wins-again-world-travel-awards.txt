SriLankan wins again at World Travel Awards

‘SriLankan Airlines, the national carrier of Sri Lanka and a member of the oneworld alliance, proving its consolidated presence in the Indian Sub-Continent has been awarded the “World’s Leading Airline to the Indian Ocean” title at the World Travel Awards World Ceremony, in Phu Quoc, Vitenman. Thirteen other leading airlines were nominated for the award.
The Award proves SriLankan’s strong presence in the South Asian region, strongly supported by its connectivity of 133 flights to 14 Indian cities (including seasonal operations to Bodh Gaya and Varanasi).
The Airline also operates to other popular cities such as Dhaka, Karachi and Lahore. The Maldives has been Sri Lanka’s extended home market with its connectivity of 31 flights a week, facilitating leisure-seekers from its extensive network of Middle East, the Europe, the Far East and Australia.
SriLankan also became the first Airline to connect Gan Island of South Maldives with the world, thus becoming the only airline that operates out of two points in the Maldives.
This year, SriLankan also won “Asia’s Leading Cultural Airline” at WTA Asia Ceremony and “Asia’s Leading Airline to the Indian Ocean” at the WTA Indian Ocean Ceremony’.
