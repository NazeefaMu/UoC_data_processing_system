Family threatens doctor over land survey

Galle Chief Magistrate A. Nishantha Peiris released three members of a family - the father, son and daughter - on a cash bail of Rs. 15,000 and a surety of Rs. 1 million each, when they were produced before him with charges of using criminal force and threatening the doctor of Rathgama Poonangoda Rural Hospital.
The suspects were further ordered to report to Rathgama Police every Sunday.
The suspects are Deva Rathnasiri (father), Deva Kapila (son) and Deva Kanthi (daughter), residents of Rathgama.
As revealed in court, a dispute had taken place between the doctor and the three persons over the surveying of land adjoining the hospital premises, on an order of the Galle High Court, for the purpose of gem mining. As the survey was going on, the doctor had resisted the surveying process, claiming that a portion of the land being surveyed belonged to the hospital. Subsequently, the surveyor had stopped his work and left the spot.
Thereafter the suspects had allegedly gone to the hospital and threatened the doctor, disturbing the official performance of the hospital, about which the doctor had complained to the police. Following investigations into the doctor’s complaint, Rathgama Police arrested the suspects and prosecuted before Galle Magistrate. Sergeant Devasingha (17205) of Rathgama police prosecuted.
