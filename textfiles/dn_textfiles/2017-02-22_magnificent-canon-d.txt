The magnificent Canon in D.

Seldom played in concert halls or at command performances; not a favourite for orchestration nor the top choices for leading conductors around the world but Canon In D from the day it debuted had survived the music scene no matter the onslaught it had earned. Such an enchanting and romantic soul-clinging score left undone. Where he did go wrong? I cannot find the answer for that for someone who even taught music and the violin for the second generation of Bachs, one of whose father happened to be the sensational Johanne Sebastian Bach.
Yet, the score remain stubbornly ahead of the extraordinary works of such from Europe and Russia. Gets annual rating from among the greats and remains so. The Annual selection of the of the 100 top most favourite composers for their works conducted by the Classic FM LISTENERS HALL FAME has CONON IN D in 13th or 14th spot most of the years because of this magnificent score ahead of such The Messiah, Requiem, The Four Seasons, St Mathews’ Passion. Ave Verum Corpus, The Blue Denub etc. few that crossed my mind. He has even pushed Mozart to the 100th spot on Ave Verum Corpus.
I too discovered CANON IN D long after I quiet music studies. My favourite conductor, Vladimir Jurowski of the London Philharmonic Orchestra I never miss seeing if ever I am in London during the seasons who unlike others unearth the less - played, less - popular scores for the benefit of all music Lovers, missed the CANON IN D or perhaps played when I was not at one of his nights.
Developed from sonata, the emphasis were almost equal to the Canzoni cantatas that began in Italy around the seventeenth century. Pachelbel fell in line with this concept for this heavenly score. Yet it lacked the technical brilliance of Bach ‘s music but the expressive fire was there. Pachelbel stored his most beautiful and deepest thoughts for this composition and it was easy because music written in Baroque period had all the essence of light romance. The extraordinary fact about Pachelbel is that he never went out of Germany either to study or perform, perhaps a reason for hie low - key profile. His claim for fame during his lifetime was as an organist and composer. Wrote dozens of corales for the organ and ninety five fugues as interludes to the MAGNIFICAT along with non - liturgical toccaras, preludes, key - board music and similar numbers. The list of his motets is a long one. More importantly, Pachelbel pioneered his musical symbolism by using such ways in his sacred music as repeated notes to illustrate.
a) steadfastness in minor keys for sorrowful moods
b) joy in major keys
c) evil in broken diminished seventh chord.
He set the first part of the CANON and Gigue in D for three violins and basso. It took the form of variations ovens the repeated short bass phrase of the in production.
Johann Pachelbel was born in 1653 in Nuremberg into a middle-class family, son of Johann (Hans) Pachelbel (born 1613 in Wunsiedel, Germany), a wine dealer, and his second wife Anna (Anne) Maria Mair. The exact date of Johann’s birth is unknown, but since he was baptized on September 1, he may have been born in late August.
During his early youth, Pachelbel received musical training from Heinrich Schwemmer, a musician and music teacher who later became the cantor of St. Sebaldus Church (Sebalduskirche). Some sources indicate that Pachelbel also studied with Georg Caspar Wecker, organist of the same church and an important composer of the Nuremberg school, but this is now considered unlikely. In any case, both Wecker and Schwemmer were trained by Johann Erasmus Kindermann, one of the founders of the Nuremberg musical tradition, who had been at one time a pupil of Johann Staden.
In June 1678, Pachelbel was employed as organist of the Predigerkirche in Erfurt, succeeding Johann Effler (c. 1640–1711; Effler later preceded Johann Sebastian Bach in Weimar). The Bach family was very well known in Erfurt (where virtually all organists would later be called “Bachs”), so Pachelbel’s friendship with them continued here. Pachelbel became godfather to Johann Ambrosius’ daughter, Johanna Juditha, taught Johann Christoph Bach (1671–1721), Johann Sebastian’s eldest brother, and lived in Johann Christian Bach’s (1640–1682) house. Pachelbel remained in Erfurt for 12 years and established his reputation as one of the leading German organ composers of the time during his stay. The chorale prelude became one of his most characteristic products of the Erfurt period, since Pachelbel’s contract specifically required him to compose the preludes for church services. His duties also included organ maintenance and, more importantly, composing a large-scale work every year to demonstrate his progress as composer and organist, as every work of that kind had to be better than the one composed the year before.
Although Pachelbel was an outstandingly successful organist, composer, and teacher at Erfurt, he asked permission to leave, apparently seeking a better appointment, and was formally released on 15 August 1690, bearing a testimonial praising his diligence and fidelity.
He was employed in less than a fortnight: from 1 September 1690, he was a musician-organist in the Württemberg court at Stuttgart under the patronage of Duchess Magdalena Sibylla. That job was better, but, unfortunately, he lived there only two years before fleeing the French attacks of the War of the Grand Alliance. His next job was in Gotha as the town organist, a post he occupied for two years, starting on 8 November 1692; there he published his first, and only, liturgical music collection.
When former pupil Johann Christoph Bach married in October 1694, the Bach family celebrated the marriage on 23 October 1694 in Ohrdruf, and invited him and other composers to provide the music; he probably attended – if so, it was the only time J.S. Bach, then nine years old, met Johann Pachelbel.
In his three years in Gotha, he was twice offered positions, in Stuttgart and at Oxford University; he declined both. Meanwhile, in Nuremberg, when the St. Sebaldus Church organist Georg Caspar Wecker (and his possible former teacher) died on 20 April 1695, the city authorities were so anxious to appoint Pachelbel (then a famous Nuremberger) to the position that they officially invited him to assume it without holding the usual job examination or inviting applications from prominent organists from lesser churches. He accepted, was released from Gotha in 1695, and arrived in Nuremberg in summer, with the city council paying his per diem expenses.
Pachelbel who was not a confirmed Christian though he wrote many sacred works, used to visit quaint ancient church on a mountain top in the windy outskirts of Nuremburg with many worshippers who came for mass from different directions to listen to their German Chief Priest who spoke no English. Tall with a magnetic personality that drew worshippers to him and among them Maria, organist who led the hymns.
On many occasions Pachelbel noticed her adoration for him and his resonant voice as she played. Maria was attracted to him. She always played a prelude and prepared the way for a longer work beginning on any note that related between others. Its tonality was smoothing and delicately beautiful as Pachebel listened. After running her fingers through keyboard, she would suddenly stop to gaze towards the alter. This was a regular happening, the gentle music falling on his ears. Maria would wait until the High Priest left. He had stolen her heart. She was sad.
THE DREAM One night, Pachelbel awoke from his dream. He heard her play the opening notes of his score, In his sleep, he put down the notes. he played while dreaming with Maria’s Canon. At dawn he visualized the concept that was going to be his CANON IN D Major.
Few Sundays later, he handed Maria the full score of Canon in D Major to be played at the end of the Mass before the congregation left. The elated Maria obliged and not one single parishioner moved until the last chord was played. As Pachelbal turned to leave the church, he saw the High Priest approach Maria who was still on the keyboard.
The glow on their faces revealed the romance of CANON IN D.
