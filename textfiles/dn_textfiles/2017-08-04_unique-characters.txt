Unique Characters!

For the thespians of Dharmaraja drama has been a process of maturation. Dramatic Moves features the English Literary and Drama Association of Dharmaraja College Kandy where drama has enabled one to become a ‘man of the world.’
Teacher in Charge of the English Literary and Drama Association (ELDA), Shanthi Kumari Navaratne feels that drama teaches you lesson for life.
“According to my knowledge, The English Literary and Drama Association of Dharmaraja started sometime back in the 1930’s. I’ve seen some pictures in the archives. In a paper cutting from the British Bulletin, I saw the committee there, and the year was 1932. I 

don’t know whether it was started in 1932 or long before that, but the picture says 1932. So it has a very long history and still we are functioning very well. Our students take part in the competitions and go for national levels and they win places,” said Navaratne.
Navaratne feels that the biggest thing students’ gain from drama is “Exposure.”
“We encourage children to take part in extracurricular activities. When children work in teams and when they go for competitions what they get is exposure and a stage to showcase their talents. I have been in the profession a long time and this is my 39th year. My reward is, when my past pupils ( I have been working in girls’ school as well) come and talk to me, and tell me that they are doing well and they have learnt so much from school, that is my reward,” explained Navaratne.
Putting together a production is hard work and takes a lot of effort.
“We used to get help from professionals as well. But during the last few years we couldn’t do that. We work as a team. We have a lot of English teachers here. So we used to get professional helps especially for Shakespeare dramas,” added Navaratne.
Navaratne believes giving the students freedom can bring out the best in them.
“Suppose we are practicing for a drama, we give them the script and give them the freedom as well. When meeting a deadline for a performance of course discipline is involved as well,” said Navaratne.
“Whatever the lessons they learn in school, drama or their academic subjects, what they learn is lessons for life. The experience and exposure I have got from my school is a lesson for life,” pointed out Navaratne.
Navaratne recalls that in 2000, they did Romeo and Juliet for Shakespeare and they won the Best Outstation School Best Actor’s Award and felt that it was really unforgettable!
Not black or white
President ELDA, Sasanka Yakandawala feels that they have gained insights into the gray areas of life.
“When it comes to the drama culture at Dharmaraja there is a lot of enthusiasm and there is a lot of talent when it comes to acting. We may not have taken part in many of the drama competitions as of late, but there is great talent and great enthusiasm at Dharmaraja,” said Yakandawala.
“We have great actors and great orators at Dharmaraja. Most of the youngsters in Grade 5, 6 &7 are very keen on acting. Some of the aspects we have delved into are love and the realities of life. It is not black or white out there. There are lots of shades of gray as well. Drama is another way of looking at life - What is outside,” explained Yakandawala.
When preparing for a deadline for a competition, the boys have a meeting with the teacher in charge and the executive committee as well.
“We then prepare a plan and a timeline. There are great teachers here who are great at directing and making scripts as well. We get the help of the students as well. We formulate a plan and execute it, meeting the deadline,” said Yakandawala.
Yakandawala felt that it is a novel way of teaching.
“Drama is another way of looking at life. As I said before, it is not just black and white but there are a lot of shades of gray as well. It is a good way of teaching students what life is really about without giving them a lecture. It is a more enjoyable way of teaching students as to what life is,” elucidated Yakandawala.
Yakandawala feels that ‘Les Miserables’ is one of his favorites and feel that the characters are definitely interesting.
“With the modern trend of tuition and high competition to get into Universities, students are drifting away from drama and other extracurricular activities. I think that is the main challenge we have. They don’t have the time to invest in these things. So we need to find a way to circumnavigate. That is the main challenge. Even on Sunday’s they have classes. We have a wealth of talent but they don’t have the time,” pointed out Yakandawala.
When considering the Drama circuit Colombo and Kandy are pretty competitive.
“If you do drama you acquire a lot of skills. You get skills just by observing. It is not like watching a movie. In a drama you have to interpret it on your own. Several people may have several different interpretations of the same drama. So that is a very good way of developing your skills,” informed Yakandawala.
Getting into the skin of a character comes to you naturally once you read the whole script and practice it.
“Now you have youtube and you can watch it. So you can get an idea about how to get about it. My whole family is really supportive of what I do. Integrating as a group can be quite hectic with different mindsets and opinions. We need to find a clear path, taking all of them together. But you need to have one goal and one mindset. It is quite hectic, but it is also good. It gives you a great deal of tolerance and develops team work,” said Yakandawala.
Practice, practice and practice!
Secretary of the ELDA, Vishwa Pathirana believes practice make perfect!
“When enacting complicating roles I would say Practice, practice and practice! However we tend to let our actors be a bit flexible with their characters, so that they can add a little bit of their individual flair to the characters that their playing. We don’t insist on them playing the characters by memorizing the scripts, but by actually understanding the character itself. So a lot of research about the characters like Julius Caesar is done,” explained Pathirana.
Pathirana, like the President feels that there is a lot of enthusiasm when it comes to drama.
“There is a lot of enthusiasm. Especially the younger students in grades 6, 7 and 8, although there was a very low point in drama at Dharmaraja about 2 -3 years ago, interest is now picking up once again,” said Pathirana.
Drama has been a source of great maturation for Pathirana.
“I believe that I am more mentally mature than when I was a beginner in drama. I believe that drama has also given me a range of perspectives about the world and life,” added Pathirana.
Pathirana feels that preparation varies from character to character.
“As I stated earlier we conduct a lot of background research about the character, the society and life at the time to get a more in depth knowledge about the character. Also we obtain recordings of great performances and derive inspiration from them as well,” pointed out Pathirana
Drama at Dharmaraja is in good hands.
“We rejuvenated the drama sector at our school which was experiencing a low point and have recognized great actors at our school and we have trained them as well as we could,” shared Pathirana.
For Pathirana, drama has affected him deeply and profoundly.
“Sometimes I’ve found that drama has given me answers and has given me refuge especially during times of grief and heartbreak. Integrating as a group is exhilarating and at times confusing. There are so many different ideas, mindsets and agendas in a group but, we’ve always managed to put aside our differences and work towards a common goal,” explained Pathirana.
