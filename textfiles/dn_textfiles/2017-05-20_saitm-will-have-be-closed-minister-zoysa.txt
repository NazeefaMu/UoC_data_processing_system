SAITM will have to be closed: Minister Zoysa

If protestors reject President’s solutions:
The SAITM will have to be closed if the solutions given by President Maithripala Sirisena are not accepted by the protestors, Irrigation and Water Resources Management Minister Vijith Vijayamuni Zoysa said. He made this observation at yesterday’s press conference at the Irrigation and Water Resources Management Ministry auditorium in response to questions raised by media personnel.
He also said that not only the SAITM, but the private hospitals, private schools and other private education institutions should be closed down if the protestors stand against the President’s solutions and the court orders in this regard.
Minister Zoysa also said that the private practice of the doctors should also be stopped and they should work at hospitals at night too.
He added that the Police had to use minimum force against the protestors as they acted against the court order and also were protesting against an institution established under existing law.
