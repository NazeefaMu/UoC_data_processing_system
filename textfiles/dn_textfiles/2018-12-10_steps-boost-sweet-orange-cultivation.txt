Steps to boost sweet  orange cultivation

‘The Agriculture Ministry plans to cultivate sweet oranges as there is a huge demand for this fruit internationally,’ said Kurunegala District senior Divisional Secretary W. E. Jayathilake.
He was speaking at a meeting he had with vegetables and fruit farmers of the Kurunegala District at the Bingiriya Agrarian Services Centre in Kurunegala, yesterday.
The Government spent Rs. 2,760 million to import oranges last year. Therefore, President Maithripala Sirisena instructed the Agriculture Ministry to take steps to grow all possible varieties in the country in order to lower the importation of vegetables, fruits, grams and other food products.
‘We have allocated 2,200 acres of land in the Moneragala District to set up an orange-growing zone where 85,000 saplings will be planted before the year ends.
It is expected to harvest around 15,000 million kilogrammes of sweet oranges through this project,’ he added.
