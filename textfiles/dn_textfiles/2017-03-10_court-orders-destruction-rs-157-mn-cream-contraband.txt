Court orders destruction of Rs 15.7 mn cream contraband

The Consumer Affairs Authority CAA claimed legal victory over one of the largest cosmetic contraband stocks ever to be nailed in the country.
Industry and Commerce Minister Rishad Bathiudeen has commended CAA officials over phone for the legal victory and also on two other raids by CAA (on match boxes and steel rods). “Good work by CAA and the alert officers for this achievement and also on quickly raiding sub-standard match box makers and steel rod makers,” the Minister said.
The Maligakanda Magistrate’s Court ordered the destruction of the entire Rs 15.7 mn contraband stock contained in 42,000 packets and at present sealed and lying at the Wellampitiya warehouse. CAA officials also said that they are planning to destroy the stock next week in the presence of a courts official.
On a tip-off, on March 9 CAA also raided a manufacturer of match boxes who produced 28,080 match boxes valued more than Rs 100,000, thus netting Sri Lanka’s largest ever sub-standard match box haul in recent times from Nittambuwa. CAA found that they were made without completing the mandatory Sri Lanka Standards (SLS) requirements. The suspects are to be produced at Attanagalle Courts on March 17. 
The CAA also raided a steel and iron rod maker in Hekitta, Wattala claimed to have manufactured 40 tonnes of iron rods (QST bars) in three sizes (10mm, 12 mm, and 16 mm) but identified by CAA as producing only 12 mm rods despite claiming three sizes, while also allegedly in lower standards than mandatory SLS requirements. The rods, estimated to be worth over Rs 4 million were manufactured locally with imported raw material.
CAA has dispatched samples from this 40 MT haul to SLS on 9 March and awaiting results. The recommendation of pending SLS report shall indicate to CAA whether to pursue further legal proceedings or not.
