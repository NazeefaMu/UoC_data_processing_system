Barbie has had a surname for the last 60 years!

Some people don’t need a surname. Cher, Seal, Prince, Madonna, Kylie, McLovin, Kajol - none of these famous faces need any further introduction.
Barbie , while not technically speaking a person, has also always been counted amongst this illustrious company for the past 59 years. Unfortunately for her however, her place on the one-name-wonder roll-call isn’t in fact merited. Because Barbie has had a surname all along.
And no, it’s not Doll. The iconic doll’s Twitter account revealed that Barbie officially goes by the name of Barbie Roberts. Her parents (yes, she has those too) are called George and Margaret.
While some mega-fans may have already known this, an overwhelming and huge majority were taken aback. It’s also her maiden name, as Ken’s surname is Carson, apparently.
That’s not the only name-related bombshell. According to Barbie folklore, ‘Barbie’ is in fact her nickname. Her full name is Barbara ‘Barbie’ Millicent Roberts.
The fact she has three sisters seemed to catch people off-guard too. Research into her siblings gets a little confusing and murky - because she’s had quite a few and, of these, a couple have quietly disappeared.
She had a sister called Kristine who was ‘discontinued’ in 2001, and her sister Kelly was replaced with Chelsea in 2010. You see, every family has its problems, even Barbie’s. Mirror
