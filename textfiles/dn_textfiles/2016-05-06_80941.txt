James Vince eyes Test spot against Sri Lanka

LONDON: James Vince is in pole position to claim a place in England’s top six for the opening Test of the summer. The Hampshire batsman has played only five times at senior level for his country - a single one-dayer and four Twenty20 matches - but is thought to be at the forefront of the selectors’ minds as they contemplate their squad for the three-match series against Sri Lanka.
The First Investec Test starts at Headingley on May 19 and it is believed a spot in the team is Vince’s to lose. He usually bats at No3 for Hampshire.
The 25-year-old began the summer in strong style, scoring a century against reigning champions Yorkshire at Headingley last month.
Vince was the leading run-scorer for England Lions in a three-match Twenty20 series against Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates late last year, which earned him the man-of-the-series award.
He was also the most prolific batsman in the County Championship two summers ago, passing 1,500 runs and making four centuries.
Four of five cricket pundits of SkySports opted for Vince to be part of the England Test squad against Sri Lanka. "I've gone for James Vince at number three ahead of Nick Compton. If you ask me about the long-term potential, then Vince has got something about him that I would like to see more of - he is a very elegant player,” said former England captain Nasser Hussain.
Former England opener Nick Knight said, “"I've seen a lot of Vince over the years and I think now is the right time for him. Picking a young player to play Test cricket is all about getting the right timing, and having been part of the England one-day set-up for a while, now is the right time for him. "He is a very classy player, an eye-catching player. He has a hundred in the Championship already this year, against Yorkshire - a very good attack - so his form is good. I have a hunch that this lad is ready to play.
England have decisions to make about their batting line-up. Captain Alastair Cook has not had a regular opening partner since the retirement of Andrew Strauss in 2012.
To put that into perspective, Strauss is now effectively Cook’s boss, as managing director of England cricket. Alex Hales did the job in South Africa and is expected to continue in the role, at least during the early part of the summer.
There also remains a feeling that the coaching team remain unconvinced by Nick Compton, who batted at No3 in South Africa.
The retirement of James Taylor, who had to quit the game last month because of a heart condition, has left the selectors with questions to answer.
