Silence, like a tide, splashes

The evening sun was setting at the faraway horizon. The sky was slightly turning to pale red. Solitary sky was disturbed by the gulls. They were flying serenely towards the western sky one after another. Ebbing tides splashed themselves on the rocks and sprayed the white foam to the empty sky. Constant coming and going of the waves drowsed me as a lullaby my mother used to sing when I was a little one.
I felt cozy on the warm sea sand while the cool breezes snared me and soothed myself. Empty papers of my file tried to fly with the sea wind but I kept it under my satchel. Crowds of people have flocked under the warmth of the setting sun. Screaming children were running and playing on the beach. But they didn’t see that the sand castles they built few minutes ago were swept away by the rude tides of the sea. I felt cold as usual. I gazed at the crowds of people but still he was absent.
At last I saw him emerging at the far end. His thin cotton shirt was trying to fly away with the rustling evening winds. He walked towards my direction, constantly looking at the setting sun, faraway in the horizon.
“Am I late? had some assignments to finish…’ Without even giving me a chance to answer, he finished the sentence.
“I came half an hour ago…..”
I looked at his face. His face was blank. Blank as usual. The noisy crowds around us, were enjoying their evening; laughing and screaming at the top of their voices. I tried to remember the silent evenings we had spent among such happy and noisy crowds. Silence…it is not something new to us. Because it is silence that we shared with each other. We sat there for some time, looking at the setting sun. We saw a world created before our eyes red, yellow and orange.
“It’s beautiful..” he said.
“Yes it is beautiful, as it is always” I whispered.
“Shall we go near that rock? “ He asked, still looking at the faraway sky.
I fetched my bag, file and the pair of slippers. The slight warmth of the sea sand has now disappeared as the sun has gone from the sky and the cold sand escorted me. After twilight, the shadows of darkness were creeping around. End of another day… yes, a silent end of another silent meeting.
We let our feet to take us along the dark streets of the city. Amidst the buzz of the busy city, we walked along the road. Where does this path take us? Is it the road to our destination? Sometimes it is really hard to understand what we really expect from life. Is it a matter of accepting everything that life gifts you? At the end, all the time we were left with the ironical answer ‘I don’t know’.
The unbearable silence reigns us. But still we were unable to disturb it as we cherished those silent moments so much. We were able to understand each other through this silence. If we can listen to the voice of our silent soul…
“Get in… the bus is going to leave” he said.
I took an empty seat at the far end. Through the misty panes of the shutter, I could see him walking along the road. He didn’t look back.
