Sri Lanka never failed to appreciate Saudi assistance:Muslim Affairs Minister

Sri Lanka never hesitated to appreciate the cordial assistance of the Saudi Government, Post and Muslim Affairs Minister M.H.A. Haleem said. He said so while accepting a 150 MT consignment of dates from the Saudi Government. The consignment was granted to be used during the Ramazan period of the Muslim people. The Minister said that it was a highly appreciate move of the Saudi Government to offers dates for the use of Sri Lankan Muslims annually.
The Minister added that there is a slight decrease of the volume of the consignment when compared with the previous years. Anyhow, the Sri Lankan Government highly appreciates the move of the Saudi Government and Saudi King to offer dates annually. “When I asked the Saudi authorities about the reduction, they told me that there was a slight decrease in the harvest. However, they told me that the consignment would be increased when they receive a better harvest,” he added. The Minister further said that Saudi and Sri Lanka have been maintaining a better rapport for decades. Owing to the strong bilateral ties, the Saudi Government is assisting in various sectors including development activities of Sri Lanka. The Secretary to the Post and Muslim Affairs Ministry Wasantha Hapuarchchi and a team representing the Saudi Government, participated on the occasion.
