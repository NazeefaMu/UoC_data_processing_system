Pre planned strategies for product life cycle management

Any product launch need careful analysis at all stages to make it successful and to recover the returns in the planned manner. The business environment is extremely competitive and leaves no room for complacency. Any omission, commission or delay will affect the success of the subject matter. Pre planned strategies should be devised for each stage of product life cycle. Most products and services developers are usually neglecting the consideration of all vital key factors in their preliminary, secondary and final evaluation.
Some spend years in the design and planning stage. A good example of a common and easy to understand case is the making of a film. The film in the first instance need to have a story which has so far not being made use of by any film producer. In other words it should be a breakthrough story. Then the film producer should select the most appropriate and suitable director for this type of stories. To select the director, the producer should possess an in depth knowledge of the film industry for at least a decade, to make sound judgements on all aspects. Together with the director selected, the producer is required to select the most dynamic and versatile cast for the film. If required auditions should be preceded for each role preceding the selection of cast. Screenplay is another important aspect of the film and the screenplay should not make the viewers feel uninterested for even one single scene. The momentum should be kept upto the end of the film. Then comes the dialogue which need to match the roles of each member of the cast. Then the selection of the music director is also of significance. The background music and songs (if any) will add to the strength of the film. Amongst other things the type and quality of film production equipment and the skills of film crew also play a pivotal part. The most important angle of the film would be the film locations and studios to be selected. The film should be shot within the shortest possible time as film artistes and crew usually have other assignments in the industry. Finally, the censor board approval and film release dates be decided. The length of the film is also important as most viewers do not wish to spend more than 2 ½ hours at the cinema. The modes of film advertising in both print and electronic media and the selection of film halls for simultaneous release will also be important factors. The film producer should target the maximum collections within the first 2 to 3 weeks from film release as the feedback from the film fans will spread. If the film is good and meets the requirements and expectations of the target audience the film will draw crowds over and above the target audience.

This product life cycle is common in most products and services. Banks and financial instituitions can make a detailed study on each customer base products and services to determine the extent of success possible with a view of safe lending. Banking products and services need special attention.
Now let us look into summarized details of each module of product life cycle.
Specific planning stage
The entrepreneur is required to have a thorough knowledge and a deep insight into the product or service to be introduced into the market. It is ideal that the product and service should be a breakthrough product and service to catch the attention of the customers. In other words the product and service is not currently available in the market or the new product and service is available in the market at present is sold and serviced by a competitor. If the same product and service is introduced into the market under a different trade and brand name it may be necessary to spend a large sum of money for sales promotion and advertising to achieve the market leader or dominancy status or to achieve a fair market share.
Product development stage
This is the most important stage of the cycle and needs lot of research data and market acceptance reports of similar products and services. A technical analysis in all aspects will ensure a tried and tested product and service.
Sensitivity analysis based on key factors
This is required for building up the perfect model for the product or the service. The quality of the product at different denominations of key factors will ensure a low cost and high quality product at a good profit mark up continuously, to ensure the availability of product in the markets at all times.
Re-development of the project model based on results of sensitivity analysis
This process is known as the ‘Stamping of class’ into the developed product or service.
Product launch
This is commonly known as the introduction stage. At a suitable time of the year the product and service should be launched. The ideal time would be a time where the consumer savings are higher and they possess the spending power to purchase. A successful launch covered by the media as well coupled with the production of a short promotional advertisements will be the beginning of the success road. The product is promoted vigorously to create awareness and develop markets for the product and service.
Product acceptance
To gain market acceptance all new products and services are required to spend a considerable part of their promotional costs in the first few weeks, to ensure large sales volumes and ready acceptance of the product and service to be launched in a majority of markets.
Growth
At this stage of the project, higher sales volumes are appearing and brand preference and increased market shares will be the result. In growth stage, firms seek to build niche markets.
Maturity
Consolidations in markets and market acceptances are at a very high level at this stage.
Competition by way of new and existing products and services
The competitors at this stage may well employ new strategies to get back their lost market shares.
To counter this threat, sufficient liquid funds are needed to tackle them head on, with similar or superior counter attack strategies.
The liquid funds should have been built up over a period from profits generated internally in anticipation of this threat.
Product innovation
Product specifications are tested again for a simple but an improved product or service in terms of technology, easier handling, cheaper with many added security features to catch the eye of consumers again.
Product relaunch
Re-launching will take place again at a time most opportune for the existing business. Launch of complimentary products may be more advantageous as both products will be made use of by the customers, that is the re-launched product and the complementary product. A higher combined profit could be achieved.
Decline
There may be a point at which superior and cost effective products will come into the market. These products may be imported ones or produced locally with superior technology by the competitors. At this stage it may be a strategic move to merge with another business house or to sell the existing business to them, unless the management is confident that further innovation is possible to counter the threats of competitors. The other option would be to shift markets.
Obsolescence
If the company fails to carry out further innovation or are unable to merge or sell the business, it will only be a matter of time before obsolescence arrives.
Market exit
Market exit is advisable after obsolescence without spending valuable resources on the product and service.
Drop out
Finally, total drop out will come. Staff cadres could be shifted to an inter company or found employment with external companies. In the alternative, compensation will have to be paid.
For each of the above stage mentioned above, alternative strategies could be designed to ensure that there will be many business alternatives at every stage of product life cycle. If manufacturing is involved, the manufacturing cycle should be reduced as far as possible with lower times for raw material procurements, factory production, selling and realizing the sales proceeds into cash. It is the cash flow that is important for the survival of any business. Sales volumes may be there at all times. However, the credit periods both inward and outward will decide on the availability of liquid cash within the company which will assist the company in the working capital management.
Let us now consider the practical cases of long term business survival and forward corporate march and product life cycle management in the long term.
The famous international drink coca cola is in Sri Lanka for over five decades and the consumers are assisting the company by being loyal to the brand, taste and the company itself. Only a few added features in packaging, like cans and mega bottles, have come in as value additions to the original product. In the case of our own Elephant brand soft drinks, the product range has been increased with additional quantities at same price. Elephant soft drinks are also in the market for a considerable time. Maliban and Munchee are two more consumer products who have been innovating their products and provided the consumers with high value all the time.
Diversification into other snack items has achieved commendable results. The local and overseas consumers are provided with a wider choice of quality products at affordable prices. They have successfully weathered the local and overseas competitors.
At the same time there were many other business ventures who had to cease functioning due to bad planning and non management of product life cycle at most vital times. For a successful management of product life cycle, a company will need excellent marketers, finance personnel, research and sales personnel, information technology and engineering staff to look into the components of the products and services with a view of cost cutting, engineering analysis and continuous edge over market competitors. BPO could be another method of cost control. Product life cycle should be jointly monitored by the directors and the top management to devise joint strategies to successfully prolong the product life cycle ousting the competitors at all times.
Though the product life cycle concept has been used successfully over the years, it has made marketers assume that there is only one trajectory for successful products. By viewing the product life cycle in the same way, marketers pursue similar positioning strategies for products and services during each stage of the life cycle. In the process, they miss out on opportunities to differentiate themselves and exploit ‘Fortune favours the brave’ concept.
Cost of entry to domestic and overseas markets is very high and it is advisable to launch on new products and services with a sufficient liquid capital, sophisticated fixed assets and a clear vision. If the launch is unsuccessful and the product and service fails, bulk of the capital pumped in will be lost. In addition business name, brand and the goodwill of the company will suffer.
Given below is a checklist of points for consideration in deciding to launch a new product or service and the management of life cycle of same.
* Nature of product and service to be launched
* Target markets
* Patent rights
* Resources required
* Cost of market entry
* Market shares
* Profit margins
* Credit periods
* Availability of resources
* Means of reaching the customers in all markets
* Innovations possible later on
* Advantages and disadvantages vis a vis competitors
* Local and imported materials and expertise required
* Long term existence
* Direct and indirect taxes payable
Depending on the product and service and the competitors and the state legislation there could be other considerations as well. Many businessmen and companies have run into difficulty after launching new products and services due to incomplete pre evaluations of the product and service life cycles. As a result they had to exit the markets and forego the invested capital.
