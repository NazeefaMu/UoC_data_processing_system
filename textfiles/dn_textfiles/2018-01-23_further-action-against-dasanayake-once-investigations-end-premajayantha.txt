Further action against  Dasanayake once investigations  end: Premajayantha

Further action against Uva Province Chief Minister Chamara Sampath Dasanayake, would be taken after the investigation into the allegations levelled against him is completed, SLFP National Organizer and Science, Technology and Research Minister Susil Premajayantha said.
He was addressing a media conference held yesterday at the SLFP Headquarters. Minister Premajayantha said that the President has already directed the IGP to probe into the allegation made against the Chief Minister, and the President also directed the Uva Governor to take over the functions of the Uva Province Education Ministry temporarily, to ensure a just and fair investigation into these allegations.
“The SLFP will not hesitate to take further action against him, if the Chief Minister is found guilty of making a principal kneel before him,” the minister said.
It has been alleged that Chief Minister Chamara had summoned the principal of the Badulla Tamil Girls' School and warned her for disregarding an order sent by him to admit a student to the school, allegedly making her kneel and apologize to him.
