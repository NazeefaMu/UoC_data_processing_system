Setting up of NEC will not abolish CCEM: Gayantha

The Cabinet Committee on Economic Management (CCEM) headed by the Prime Minister will not be abolished with the setting up of National Economic Council (NEC) headed by the President, Parliamentary Reforms and Lands Minister Gayantha Karunathilake said.
The minister was responding to a question by a journalist at a press conference at Sirikotha UNP Headquarters yesterday. The minister said the recommendations and proposals of the CCEM and the NEC would finally reach the Cabinet, and the Cabinet could either endorse or reject them after careful consideration.
“The CCEM chaired by the PM over the past several months took decisions on many projects and investments, and economic affairs and those were submitted to the Cabinet for consideration. The President’s proposal in setting up the NEC is to make it the central decision making body on all economic affairs. Both will be answerable to the Cabinet,” the minister said.
The Cabinet last week approved the President’s proposal to set up the NEC. The NEC chaired by the President will comprise the Prime Minister, Finance Minister, Secretary to the President, Secretary to the Prime Minister, Central Bank Governor and Secretary to the Treasury among others.
The CCEM was appointed following a Cabinet decision on September 22, 2015. According to the Performance Report of Prime Minister’s Office, the CCEM had conducted 43 meetings from January to December 2016, and it has given 931 decisions/policy directives mainly on key economic issues related to National Policies and Economic Affairs, Finance, Development Strategies and International Trade, Transport and Civil Aviation, Ports and Shipping, Power and Renewable Energy, Highways and Public Enterprises Development.
Minister Karunathilake commenting on the criticisms directed at Justice Minister Dr Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe said he too holds the opinion that legal actions pertaining to certain cases related to large scale corruption and fraud have been unduly delayed.
"This is the widely held public opinion and it was reverberated in the UNP Working Committee and the Parliamentary Group meeting. We have to deliver on our pre-election promises. We, by no means, want to interfere in judiciary, but we see that the current pace of these investigations is sluggish.
The law should be implemented against the wrong doers, may they be in the previous government or this government,” the minister said.
