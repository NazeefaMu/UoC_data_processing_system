Chamari’s double in vain Sri Lanka Women lose ODI series

Sri Lanka Women skipper Chamari Atapattu’s fine double of scoring a half century and capturing three wickets proved a vain effort as her team fell short by eight runs to secure a win in the second ODI against Indian Women at the Galle International Stadium yesterday.
Sri Lanka Women did very well to dismiss the strong Indian batting line up for 219 to leave themselves with a chance of leveling the three-match series.
But after being in a position to win at 165-5 in the 42nd over Sri Lanka buckled under pressure to be dismissed for 212 to lose by seven runs. Three run outs also didn’t help Sri Lanka’s cause.
Apart from Atapattu’s 57 off 95 balls, veteran all rounder Shashikala Siriwardene chipped in with a useful knock of 49 off 91 balls. Nilakshi de Silva made a valiant attempt to get her team across the line with a determined 31 off 19 balls before being ninth out at 207.
India Women’s total was made up by half centuries from skipper Mithali Raj and Taniya Bhatia.
With this win India Women take a winning 2-0 lead in the three-match series.
The final ODI will be played at Katunayake on September 16.
Scores:
Indian Women 219 in 50 overs (Mithali Raj 52, Taniya Bhatia 68, Dayalan Hemalatha 35, Udeshika Prabhodani 2/45, Sripali Weerakkody 2/36, Chamari Atapattu 3/42)
Sri Lanka Women 212 in 48.1 overs (Chamari Atapattu 57, Shashikala Siriwardene 49, Nilakshi de Silva 31, Mansi Joshi 2/49, Rajeshwari Gayakwad 2/37)
