Another successful Member’s Weekend

Members of the Classic Car Club of Ceylon were treated to a memorable Classic Challenge Pannala member’s drive-and-stay weekend recently.
The stunning engines of 53 classic cars were revved at 6.30am on Saturday 9 June at Town Hall, signalling the start of a glorious procession passing by appreciative onlookers, until the cavalcade stopped for a sponsored breakfast by the Negombo Motor Sports Club.

The cars then took to the road again, this time making their way to the Pannala International Race Circuit, where an entire morning of festivities awaited.
Entertainment came in the form of fun games such as musical chairs, adrenalin-fuelled sprints at the track, and even activities specific to the theme such as Gymkhana auto tests; keeping members and their families both challenged and engaged in a genuinely sporting atmosphere.
In addition to the club’s familiar faces, the Classic Challenge Pannala 2018 was honoured this time by the presence of six participants from the Federation of Historic Vehicles of India (FHVI) -the Indian arm of the esteemed The Fédération International des Véhicules Anciens (FIVA)-, joining a club event for the first time.“The Classic Challenge Pannala 2018 has been the perfect way to mark a weekend of motoring with our members,” said Classic Car Club of Ceylon President Ramani Ponnambalam speaking at the gala dinner. “Not only have our members been given yet another opportunity to interact with one other, but also for the first time, to interact with and exchange individual expertise with our esteemed guests from FHVI.”
The Main Sponsor of the Event was Nankang Tyres and Smart Wheels (Pvt) Ltd., with McLarens Lubricants, Mobil, Pidilite (Pvt) Ltd., and Fevicol as event partners.
