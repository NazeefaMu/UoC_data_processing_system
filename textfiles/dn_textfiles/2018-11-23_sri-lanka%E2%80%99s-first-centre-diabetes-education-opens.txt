Sri Lanka’s first centre for diabetes education opens

Sri Lanka’s first Centre of Excellence for diabetes education was opened by the college of Endocrinologist in partnership with Morison PLC. The centre will be utilized by Endocrinologists and other specialities to enhance their knowledge to strive to assist in Sri Lanka’s efforts to address Diabetes, which is a growing national concern.
There is an alarming increase of prevalence in diabetes in Sri Lanka, where a Colombo Urban Study shows that 27.1 per cent of the Colombo urban population suffers from diabetes.
The Centre of Excellence will cater to provide for a much-needed opportunity for medical professionals to enhance their knowledge through awareness session, research, and discussions. “We are thankful for Morison PLC for coming forward to assist us in addressing a growing concern in Sri Lanka,” President - College of Endocrinologist, Dr. Manilka Sumanatilake said.
The centre for excellence in diabetes is a forum which will facilitate the work of healthcare professionals in their effort to implement the National Diabetes Management Strategy. It will provide easy access to global and local information about diabetes management through technology and resources. The centre will be an excellent resource where health care professionals can meet to develop solutions for diabetes.
“It is a privilege to partner with the College of Endocrinology through the Centre of Excellence which is meant to help research in Diabetes. Morison being part of the Hemas Group, looks forward to working in the space of diabetes awareness, prevention and cure in the years to come. To further these efforts, we have commenced work in building a State-of-the-Art EUGMP pharmaceutical manufacturing facility in Homagama to provide efficacious medicine to the Sri Lankan patient,” says Managing Director at Morison PLC, Murtaza Esufally.
