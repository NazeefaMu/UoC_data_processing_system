SLMC to support PM

The Sri Lanka Muslim Congress will support Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe and vote against the No Confidence Motion submitted by the Joint Opposition, SLMC Secretary Shafeek Rajabdeen said, yesterday.
Responding to the Daily News, Rajabdeen said several parties have approached them seeking the SLMC’s support. However, he said the party will stand for the continuation of the unity government.
“As a partner of the unity government, we will continue to support it,” he said.
However, Rajabdeen added that the government should learn from the recent local government election results and enact necessary changes to move forward as a more vibrant and effective force.
He said the government should commit itself to fulfilling the promises given to the people without delay.
