KANDY SPORTS ROUND UP: Muralitharan chief guest at 100th Trinity-Antonian clash

The world's top class spinner Muthiah Muralitharan will grace the opening ceremony of the Trinity-St. Anthony’s 100th big match next Friday at Pallekele Stadium. Born in Kandy at the age of 9 Muralitharan was admitted to St. Anthony's College, Kandy. He began his cricketing career as a medium pace bowler but on the advice of his junior coach, Sunil Fernando, he took up to off-spin when he was 14 years old. He soon impressed and went on to play for four years in the senior team as an all-rounder and batted in the middle order. In his final two seasons he took over hundred wickets and in 1990/91 was named as the 'Bata Schoolboy Cricketer of the Year. He played for Kandy CC and later joined Tamil Union. He was selected for the Sri Lanka A tour of England in 1991. He played in five games but failed to capture a single wicket. On his return to Sri Lanka he impressed against Allan Border's Australian team in a practice game and then went on to make his Test debut at the R. Premadasa Stadium in the second Test of the series. He retired from Test cricket in 2010, registering his 800th and final wicket on 22 July 2010 with his final ball in his last Test match.
Another Sri Lanka great Kumar Sangakkara will be chief guest at the Trinity-Antonian limited overs match on March 18 at Asgiriya Stadium. Sangakkara will not be available for the Big Match due to his other commitments.
Wesley was in Kandy on a goodwill visit
Last week the Principal of Wesley College along with the Chaplain, Captain and Vice Captain of the rugby team paid a visit to Trinity College to meet the Principal, Rugby Captain and the Vice Principal. This visit was due to the unwanted incident which occurred at the Trinity-Wesley rugby game at Longden Place. Further it was very nice of the captain and the vice captain to present a rugger ball signed by them to symbolize the friendship. In rugby a bit of rough play is part of the game, but this is only between the players when the referee intervenes and controls, and certainly not by the spectators and public. Wesley and Trinity have a long history of friendship and camaraderie in the sporting field. They first met at rugby in 1957, which game Trinity won, then at cricket in 1903 - that was a win for Wesley, then in 1950 in hockey where Trinity won.
