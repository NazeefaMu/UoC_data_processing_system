Govt. should desist political vengeance: Ven. Walpola Piyananda Thera

Chief Sanghanayake of the United States Most Ven. Walpola Piyananda Thera said the government should desist from taking revenge from its opponents.
“Rulers should treat all citizens equally including its opponents," he said.
Piyananda Thera was addressing the media after visiting National Freedom Front Leader and parliamentarian Wimal Weerawansa at Welikada Prison yesterday.
“Vengeance has become the order of the day,” the Thera said adding that Sri Lankans living in the United States think that the government has started taking revenge from their opponents.
“This is a very bad precedence. The change expected by the people is visible today.
Heaps of garbage has accumulated in every nook and corner of the city, unlike in the past," he said.
