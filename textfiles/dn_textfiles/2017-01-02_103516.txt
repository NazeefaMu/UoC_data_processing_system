President, Prime Minister work with vision for future: Rajitha

Today the President and the Prime Minister work with a vision for the future. This Good Governance government will continue without any problem and toppling it will be only a dream, Health Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne said.
According to Minister Dr. Senaratne, some says this government will be toppled and some are trying to shake the government. But nothing will happened. He was addressing the gathering after opening the Rs. 1.35 million worth drinking water project at Katuhena hospital, Mathugama constructed by Sri Lanka Navy.
The minister said the two main political parties were great enemies and that hatred is in the minds of some politicians. All senior and experienced ministers are standing by the government.
I am against the system that professionals are being transferred by politicians. Scolding is what should not be done when something goes wrong. The full stop will be placed for the era which youths criticise the politicians, he added.
