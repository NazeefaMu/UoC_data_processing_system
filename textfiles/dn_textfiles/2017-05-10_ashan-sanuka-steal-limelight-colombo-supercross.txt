Over the limit...
A poor display of sportsmanship was evident in the 1500 cc Ford Laser/ Mazda car event as race leader Susantha Gunawardena and ultimate winner Upulwan Serasinghe engaged in an ungentlemanly confrontation from the beginning.
Both drivers knocked on each other’s vehicles several times and tried to obstruct each other’s way. Upulwan won the race at the last moment after knocking race leader Susantha’s car which resulted in Susantha been delayed to complete the race at third.
Susantha was quick to lodge a protest against Upulwan and the organizers did not announce the result subject to an inquiry.
The racing critics criticized both senior drivers, that their disgusting behaviour will remain a big black mark in Sri Lanka motor racing history.
