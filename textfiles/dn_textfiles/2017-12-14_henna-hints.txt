Henna hints

Henna is a hair colouring dimension which dates back to hundreds of years. Lately it has become a symbol of modern fashion to many women and men. Henna isn't just for covering grey hair. It makes your hair strong, voluminous and shiny. It is considered as a home remedy for various hair problems. Regular use of Henna on hair will help your hair regain the lost lustre and result in healthy hair.
Henna for all hair types
Natural Henna can be used on virgin hair that has not been chemically straightened, curled or coloured. It is not advisable to use Henna if you want to continue with the above mentioned chemical treatments as it will act as a barrier sometimes.
Natural Henna is actually one of the most versatile hair care treatments. Unlike a lot of commercial products which say they are only good for certain hair types, you can use Henna no matter what the texture your hair is.
Henna for chemically coloured hair
Pure Henna (Lawsonia inermis) does not react badly with previously chemically-treated hair. The problem only arises if the brand you buy has additives, synthetic dyes or metallic salts. Read the ingredients or use body art quality Henna. As long as you use pure, body art quality Henna, you can Henna over chemically dyed hair.
However Henna is permanent and can't be removed or stripped out easily when used over a period of time. Those who foresee lots of chemical processing in their near future might want to hold off on Henna as going back to chemical colouring and other chemical treatments might be difficult.
Lasting period
Henna stays rich and vibrant for four to six weeks. You can layer the colour as much as you want. The colour will build after every application, making for dense, multi-dimensional colour.
Things that should be done before applying Henna
A skin sensitivity test should be carried out 48 hours prior to henna application.
Applying Henna
Shampoo and then dry your hair. Before applying Henna, you will want to start with clean hair. Wash your hair with your regular shampoo to remove dirt, oil, and styling products inn the shower or bath.
Protect your hairline. If you have long hair, gather it up and tie it back so it is out of your face and off your shoulders and neck. Apply a barrier cream around your hair line. Comb and part your hair. Let your hair down and comb it with a wide-toothed comb. This will remove tangles and knots without making your hair frizzy. Part your hair in the center, and let your hair fall evenly to either side of your head.
Protect your skin. Henna tends to get everywhere, so it’s a good idea to wear old clothes and to protect yourself with a rag or old towel. Drape the towel over your shoulders. Arrange the towel to cover your neck and shoulders, and use a pin or hair clip to keep it together. Put on a pair of rubber or latex gloves to protect your hands and nails because Henna can stain the skin.
common Henna faux pas
The most common mistake that people make when applying Henna has to do with root coverage. Be sure to get down to the roots of your hair as you colour (this is common for all hair colouring practices).
Henna has a thicker consistency than chemical dyes, less runny, and may require a little more attention to ensure that it’s touching and colouring all hair on the scalp. You want it there too - Henna conditions the scalp while it colors. It detoxes the follicle-root junction and nourishes the scalp so massage it deep to the scalp. Go heavy. I is worth it all around for colour, richness and treatment benefits. A hair colouring brush will definitely assist with roots, but is not paramount for quality Henna hair application.
Avoiding stains below the hairline, ears and neck
Smooth a protective balm/cream around the hairline and neck to ensure your skin is not accidentally tinted. Use protective ear guards to protect the ears.
Getting Henna stains off your fingers and skin
The easiest way is just to let it take some time. Most light stains will fade by morning, but if you have a deep, dark stain (you left skin fully exposed and immersed in Henna) well, you can only really speed up the fade time by applying natural oils (coconut, olive). They may help fade the stain faster and along with some direct exposure to UV (sun) light. Best advice: wash up very well after finishing hair application. If it stays on the skin for too long, it’s simply going to stain (for a few days in worst case if it is full exposure and left on skin for 2 hours). Pure Henna will stain longer (up to two weeks). Just wash up well to avoid such blunders.
Neutral Henna
Neutral Henna is actually Cassia Obovata. Potent botanical remedies are harvested from the leaves, pods, and seeds of this flowering Senna legume tree. Cassia conditions the hair, and shares in some of the hair treatment qualities of Henna, but it does not dye the hair like Henna.
It can boost blonde colours and undertones, or stain gray hair slightly blonde. Bunettes and redheads won’t notice a colour change.
Consider it a conditioning Henna clear coat for the hair. Mix and apply to hair just like Henna and Henna-herbals. It’s excellent for a conditioning and shine boost
Storing leftover Henna powder
The best way to store any remaining powder is to place it all in an airtight zip lock bag/container. Remove any remaining air and then keep from light. Store in a cool dry place. Don’t store in the bathroom as it may get too humid and warm.
Identifying a quality Henna product
High quality Henna can be recognised by the intensity of the dye.
Another hint is where and how the Henna was stored.
You can also identify it according to the intensity of the colour of the powder (it is similar to barley and spirulina)
It is a quality product if your scalp doesn’t itch when you use it.
If your hair is not dry, then your product is of good quality.
The colour reacts within one hour in a good quality product.
High quality Henna does not wash out fast.It only contains additives like amla, shikakai, reetha, brahma, indigo and other Ayurvedic herbs.
High-quality Henna does not contain any PPD, chemical dyes, peroxide or ammonia.Your hair should be stronger and with no dandruff if you use high quality Henna.
