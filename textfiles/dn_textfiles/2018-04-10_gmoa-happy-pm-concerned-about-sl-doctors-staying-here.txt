GMOA happy that PM concerned about SL doctors staying here

Government Medical Officers’ Association (GMOA) is happy that the Prime Minister and the government are concerned about keeping Sri Lankan doctors in the country, GMOA Secretary Dr. Haritha Aluthge said.
Addressing a press conference held at the GMOA Headquarters in Colombo yesterday, he said that there are certain things that need to be done in order to keep Sri Lankan doctors in the island, as stated by the Prime Minister during his recent speech at the World Health Day celebration.
According to Dr. Aluthge, the former Health Minister and current President did a significant service towards doctors and as a result, the number of consultants (specialists) increased threefold, while the total number of doctors doubled. The situation improved after the previous government ended the war in 2009. But under the current government, a hostile environment has been created in Sri Lanka for doctors.
Dr. Aluthge pointed out that certain things such as not signing the ECTA without a national policy on foreign trade agreements, not letting provincial health conventions destroy island-wide health service, stopping the creation of unqualified doctors through fraudulent companies such as SAITM, offering tax relief for doctors, not violating the National Wages Policy, making sure that doctors’ children get suitable schools and stopping all interference in granting duty free vehicle permits to doctors, should be looked into in order to encourage Sri Lankan doctors to remain in the country without migrating.
