School heads instructed to assist O/L students to obtain NICs

Principals have been instructed by the Education Ministry to take steps to get National Identify Cards (NICs) for schoolchildren who sit for the G.C.E. (O.L.). Examination-2017 in December from their schools.
Many students who sat for the G.C.E.(A/L) and G.C.E. (O/L) Exam in the last few years had faced severe difficulties as they could not get their NICs on time.
Some school heads have filled application forms incorrectly. Consequently, students and parents had to undergo severe difficulties at the last moment of the exams, sources said.
All students at the age of 15 can apply for a NIC. The Department of Examinations has called for applications for the O/L exam 2017. The closing date for applications is May 31. School candidates have to submit their applications through their school heads, while private candidates have to submit their applications directly to the Commissioner General of Examinations.
The G.C.E.(O.L.) Examination-2017 will be held from December 12 to 21.
