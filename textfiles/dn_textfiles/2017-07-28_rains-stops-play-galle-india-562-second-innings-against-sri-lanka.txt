Rains stops play at Galle, India 56/2 in second innings against Sri Lanka

 
India was 56-2 in their second innings when rain halted play on the third day of their first Test against Sri Lanka in Galle, today.
The top-ranked visitors, who posted 600 in their first innings, are 365 runs ahead after skipper Virat Kohli decided not to enforce the follow on.
Sri Lanka was bowled out for 291 shortly after lunch, to hand 309-run first innings lead to India.
