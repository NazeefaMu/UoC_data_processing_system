Sasikala urges Colombo to release all Tamil Nadu fishermen before Pongal

 
Chennai: AIADMK general secretary V. K. Sasikala called upon Colombo to immediately free all the fishermen languishing in Lankan prisons and also release the fishing vessels impounded by the Sri Lankan navy, ahead of Pongal festivities.
She also urged the Centre to prevail upon the island nation and ensure the safe return of the fishermen and help them reunite with their families to celebrate the harvest festival - Pongal.
Taking strong exception to the inhumane treatment meted out to the Tamil Nadu fishermen by the Sri Lankan, Ms. Sasikala said “the continued aggression and inhumane treatment meted out to the Tamil Nadu fishermen by the Sri Lankan navy has caused me anguish. The latest incident is the detention of fishermen from Pudukottai district's Jagathapattinam and impounding their fishing vessels on Jan.4.”
