Aged couple forced to make cave their home

An elderly couple, R.B. Dharmadasa and his wife J.H. Bandara Menike, have been living in a cave for the last 27 years for want of a house of their own.
The cave is situated near a chena named Konaneyaya in the Serathkada grama niladhari division in the Padiyatalawa DS division, nearly 8 km off Serathakada.
Dharmadasa said the wattle and daub house they were living in was destroyed during heavy rains in 1992 and since then they shifted into this cave, as they did not have funds to build a new house.
They have no income at present and make a living with the meagre Samurdhi allowance of Rs. 2,000 per month. Very often they had to skip meals due to their penury. Archaeology authorities have requested them to move out of the cave, but they are unable to accede to this request as they have nowhere to go.
They appeal to the public or social service organisations to provide a house for them.
