Crop insurance paid to paddy extended to five main crops

The crop insurance that has so far covered only paddy cultivation has been extended to cover other major five food crops, as announced by Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayake at the Budget-2017.
The Government has already launched a two-year National Food Production Programme to ensure self-sufficiency in potatoes, big onions, chillies, maize and soya beans.
The farmers of these crops will also receive crop insurance. and will be paid compensation up to Rs. 10,000 per acre for crop damages in any natural calamity. The agricultural insurance scheme is funded by 1 percent levy charged from the profits of all registered banks, financial institutions and the insurance companies since 2013. This levy is credited to the National Insurance Trust Fund from which the farmers are paid compensation through the Agricultural and Agrarian Insurance Board.
The farmers whose crops were affected during the drought in the Maha season were paid up to Rs 10,000 per acre last month.
The government introduced the National Loan Protection Scheme in 2016 to provide further relief to farmers who could not repay their bank loans due to damages caused to their crops.
The National Loan Protection Scheme initiated for the purpose, on behalf of the farmers, will pay their banks loan outstanding after having assessed the crop damages. The government has estimated that Rs. 500 M will have to be paid to banks in lieu of the loan obtained by the farmers during 2016/2017 Maha season.
Even this scheme is supported by the levy charged on the banks and financial institutions
The National Insurance Trust Fund since the introduction of the 1 percent levy on profits of the banks, financial and insurance institutions has so far received Rs 5,069.81 million and disbursed Rs 3,932.34 million as the payment for crop damages and other relief to farmers.
Another Rs 500 million has been earmarked to be provided to the Agricultural and Agrarian Insurance Board to provide relief to farmers under the National Loan Protection Scheme.
