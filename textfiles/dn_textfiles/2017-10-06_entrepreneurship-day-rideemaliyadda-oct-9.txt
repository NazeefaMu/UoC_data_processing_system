Entrepreneurship Day at Rideemaliyadda on Oct 9

The Entrepreneurship Day, which is the fourth day of the Jathika Ahara Nishpadana Sangrama Sathiya (National Food Production War Week) of the Government, will be held at Rideemaliyadda in Badulla on October 9.
Plantation Industries Ministry Secretary J. A. Ranjith told that the programme would give a new life to Maha season food crop cultivation which drew back during the last few seasons due to the adverse weather conditions.
Secretary Ranjith said Plantation Industries Minister Navin Dissanayake would distribute 3000 best quality coconut saplings at Rideemaliyadda among the farmers in the Badulla district. He said coconut saplings would also be provided at concessionary level to public servants.
He said a special workshop was organised to educate the schoolchildren in the area on the coconut cultivation.
