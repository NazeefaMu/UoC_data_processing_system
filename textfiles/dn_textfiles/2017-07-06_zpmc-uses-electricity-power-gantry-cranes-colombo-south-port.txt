ZPMC uses electricity to power gantry cranes at Colombo South Port

ZPMC Lanka Company (Private) Limited, the joint venture between Shanghai Zhenhua Heavy Industries Company Limited of China and Access Engineering PLC, is engaged in a contract for the conversion of 40 numbers of diesel engine driven rubber tired gantry cranes (RTG) into electricity driven gantries (ERTG) at Colombo South Port operated by Colombo International Container Terminals Limited.
The design, manufacture and supply of the electricity driven gantry system was awarded to Shanghai Zhenhua Heavy Industries Company Ltd while construction, installation and commissioning was subcontracted to ZMPC Lanka (Pvt) Ltd.
The project was initiated by Colombo International Container Terminals Ltd (CICT) with the objective of establishing a Green Port concept with a significant reduction of GHG emissions approximately by 45% and the reduction of cost per tons of equivalent units (Cost/TEU).
The scope of the work entrusted to ZPMC Lanka includes the construction of four numbers of convertor stations, a DC conductor bus bar system, modification of RTGs inclusive of installation of power trolleys, high voltage and low voltage cable laying with termination work and commissioning and handing over of the project.
Meeting the tight time schedule in the execution of the project is extremely challenging while the CICT terminal is in full operation and the daily requirements of the RTGs should be provided while only few RTGs are allocated for modification.
A qualified and well experienced set of Chinese technical experts are currently engaged in the construction and commissioning work along with the ZPMC Lanka engineering team to complete the project, scheduled for October 2017.
