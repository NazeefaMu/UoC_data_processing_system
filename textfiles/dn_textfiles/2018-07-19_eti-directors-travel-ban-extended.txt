ETI Directors travel ban extended

Colombo Fort Magistrate Lanka Jayaratne yesterday extended the ban on overseas travel for ETI Finance Limited directors of the Edirisinghe Group indefinitely. Accordingly Jeewaka Edirisinghe, Nalaka Edirisinghe, Deepa Edirisinghe and Asanga Edirisighe have been banned from travelling overseas.
Court issued the travel ban after taking the submissions made by the Attorney General into account. The company is accused of not paying billions of money deposited by the public.
