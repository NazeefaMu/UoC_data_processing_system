Yala National Park

Motherly love and care is extended in equal measure to the offspring by humans and animals alike as exemplified by this she-elephant who blocked oncoming vehicles to allow her baby elephants to cross the road at Kotigala in the Yala National Park the other day. Foreign tourists who were among those present enjoyed the spectacle, notwithstanding the 30 minute delay they encountered. Picture by Ambalantota Group Corr. Rahul Samantha Hettiarachchi
