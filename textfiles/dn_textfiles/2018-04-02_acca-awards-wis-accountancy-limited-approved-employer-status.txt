ACCA awards WIS Accountancy Limited with Approved Employer status

The Association of Chartered Certified Accountants (ACCA) recently awarded WIS Accountancy Limited with the Approved Employer Professional Development status.
This approval indicates ACCA’s recognition of employers who maintain high standards of staff training, accountancy resources and development for their ACCA members and trainees. It enables employers to benchmark their training and development practices against ACCA’s best practice training standards and to receive global recognition for the training and development opportunities they provide. In order to achieve the ACCA Employer status, WIS needed to adhere to ACCA’s best practices across various areas including work experience, supervision, training and continual development.
Trainees studying towards the ACCA qualification can now claim exemption from the performance objective component of their practical experience requirements. They will only be required to provide details of their employment with WIS Accountancy Limited to claim the performance objective exemption.
With their head office based in London, and founded by a team of Sri Lankan professionals WIS is a modern and dynamic firm of Chartered Management Accountants providing a wide range of services for Contractors and Freelancers including Accountancy, Taxation, Mortgage and Insurance Consultation.
WIS also has an office in Sri Lanka staffed by a 26 member team of professionals that include chartered accountants, mortgage para-planners, and insurance experts.
Commenting on the accreditation, Suneth Silva, Director of WIS said, “This status demonstrates that WIS meets ACCA’s demanding criteria for professional development, including having the policies and processes in place that allow members to meet the minimum performance experience requirements for ACCA. It also acknowledges and strengthens the image of WIS as a responsible employer. We constantly invest in our people and their professional development. Modern career path entails constant changes and the need to adapt, especially for the accountants and finance professionals. The success of WIS depends on these people and we assume it our ultimate responsibility to provide them with proper environment and support for continuing learning and development, so they can always be acute and ready for changes and innovations.”
In formally welcoming WIS to the ACCA’s Approved Employer program, Head of ACCA Sri Lanka Nilusha Ranasinghe said the accreditation was no easy feat and it was an achievement they should be proud of. She added “This award recognizes the rigour of the learning and development programs that WIS has put in place for ACCA members, and demonstrates that WIS’s accountants and finance professionals are maintaining the skills and knowledge at high levels.”
