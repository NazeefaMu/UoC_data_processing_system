Charlo downs Jackson to make history

LOS ANGELES, SUNDAY: Jermell Charlo made boxing history on Saturday after scoring an eighth-round knockout of John Jackson in Las Vegas to claim the vacant World Boxing Council super-welterweight title.
Charlo joins twin brother Jermall Charlo as a reigning world champion in the 154-pound (69.8kg) category -- the first time twin siblings have owned world titles in the same weight division. The 26-year-old Jermell Charlo was trailing on all three judges scorecards after the first seven rounds against the skillful Jackson, but unleashed a brutal series of punches to score a knockout in the eighth round.
Charlo, who had caught Jackson flush on the chin with a left hook in the fifth round, connected with another stinging blow to his opponent's head early in the eighth round.
A stunned Jackson appeared dazed by the shot, and turned away from Charlo, who moved in for the kill, sending his opponent crashing into the ropes with a two powerful left hooks to the head.
Referee Tony Weeks halted the fight to prevent Jackson suffering further punishment.
“It's history, we did it,” a delighted Charlo said.
“I'm waiting on my brother next,” added Charlo, who improved to 28-0 with 13 knockouts. Jermall Charlo, 23-0 with 18 knockouts, is to fight on the same card later Saturday. Charlo defends his defends his International Boxing Federation crown against former champion Austin Trout.
