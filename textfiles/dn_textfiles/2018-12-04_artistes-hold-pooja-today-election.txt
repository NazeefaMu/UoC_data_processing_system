Artistes hold pooja today for election

An Adhistana Pooja (ritual of determination) will be held at Independence Square today (4) at 4 pm calling for an election to end the current economic, social, political and religious crisis in the country and to bring goodwill to the people by ensuring sovereignty. The function is organised by the Free Arts Guild. The dress code is white attire.
