Investors need swift project approvals - Speaker

Investors will come into the country only if quick approval is granted to their project proposals, Speaker Karu Jayasuriya said.
For instance the Shanghai Investment zone in China provides a one day service for project proposals. A project proposal submitted in the morning gains approval the same afternoon. I did not believe in it at first. But later I realised that seeing is believing, Speaker Jayasuriya said addressing a meeting after inaugurating the third stage of the Sethsiripaya development scheme of the Megalopolis Development plan.
It was initiated by the UDA under the Megalopolis and Western Development Ministry yesterday.
The Speaker said as opined by Megalopolis and Western Development Minister Patali Champika Ranawake, people everywhere had a right to obtain an efficient service to them. When people visit a hospital they should receive an expeditious service including the issuing of drugs.
Similary, people visiting a railway station or bus station should be provided with a efficient service to travel to their destinations.
If people having railway season tickets cannot reach the station to board a train on time, it was a denial of their fundamental rights. According to available reports thousand or more strikes and demonstrations had been conducted last year for frivolous reasons. The Speaker said government servants in Sri Lanka had only 250 working days per year. Sri Lanka was a country enjoying the largest number of public holiday per year in the whole world.
“In foreign countries there was a single government servant per every 250 people. But in Sri Lanka there was a government servant per every 15 members of the population. The people had a right to obtain a quick service when they visited a government office.
He said they hoped to bring all independent commissions under one roof at Sethsiripaya soon.
The government objective was to provide an apolitical service to the public. The independent Commissions were rendering a praiseworthy service to the people.
The Right to Information Act had hoped to eliminate waste to a large extent.
The Speaker said Sri Jayawardhanapura will regain its ancient grandeur with the completion of the development projects undertaken by the Ministry.
The Megalopolis and Western Development Minister said the Parliament building had brought a new vista to the ancient Kotte Kingdom which is now called Sri Jayawardhanapura.
Their intention was to shift all government departments to the Sri Jayewardhanapura city, Already 40 institutions had applied to shift into the city. Several buildings have been planned to accommodate them. He had been able to transform the UDA into a financially strong independent institution during the last two years.
The entire investment of Rs. 15 billion in the building project launched yesterday would be borne by the UDA.
They also hoped to build several new road networks this year. This would include a light rail network from Kaduwela to Pettah. US$ 1.4 billion funded by Japan, Secretary Megalopolis and Western Development Ministry Nihal Rupasinghe, UDA Director General Sumedha Ratnayake and other officials were also present.
