SL women’s cricketers ready to face West Indies challenge

The Sri Lanka women’s cricketers, who will embark on a tour of the West Indies from October 5 to 27, have improved with the experience derived from this year’s world cup, according to team Manager Indrani Abeyratne.
The 15-member national women’s squad will meet the West Indies in three (03) ODIs on October 11, 13 and 15, and three T20s on October 19, 21 and 22.
“The players have worked hard on their preparations, and there is a changed outlook as a whole,” she said while adding that there was a new inclusion in wicket-keeper batsman Rebecca Vandert.
Expressing optimism of getting the better of the West Indies, she said that Sri Lanka’s captain Inoka Ranaweera was an exceptional player. She had the rare distinction of being the only women’s cricketer to have taken a hat-trick in world cricket against New Zealand away in 2015.
Meanwhile, coach, Hemantha Devappriya said that while the team had struck a pleasing balance in most every department of the game, a buoying factor was that the team had averaged a score of 190 in an innings during this year’s world cup.
The team used to average 130 which were not good enough. But in the 7 matches in the world cup we averaged 190,” he said.
Much home work had gone into the effort of raising their game. “We developed a range of shots to increase the number of singles. We were therefore able to increase from an average of 40 runs to 80 at the world cup through singles,” the coach explained.
Commenting on the player capacity, he said that it is an advantage to have 7 specialist batsmen including wicket-keeper batsman Rebecca Vandert. Two of them were all-rounders. There were 4 ‘major spinners’ in right arm bowlers Shashikala Siriwardena and Chamarie Athapattu and left armers Chandima Weerakkody and skipper Inoka Ranaweera. In the pace bowling department, there were 4 specialists in Sripali Weerakkody who is also a middle order batsman, Hasni Perera, Udeshika Prabodini, Ama Kanchana and Achini Kulasuriya. The batting was quite strong with 3 openers in Hasini, Nipuni Hansika and Yasoda Mendis. The middle order comprised Atapattu, Dilani Monodara and Shashikala.
The Lankan women’s team to west Indies - Inoka Ranaweera (Captain), Sripali Weerakkody (Vice Captain), Rebeca Vandort (Wicket Keeper), Prasadani Weerakkody, Chamari Athapaththu, Dilani Manohara, Nipuni Hansika, Hasini Perera, Yashoda Mendis, Chandima Gunarathne, Hansima Karunarathne, Shashikala Siriwardena, Ama Kanchana, Achini Kulasuriya, Udeshika Pabodinie
