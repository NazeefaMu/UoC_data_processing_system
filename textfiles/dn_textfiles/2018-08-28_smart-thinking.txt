SMART thinking!

An explanation session regarding 'SMART classrooms' for the second section students, who are to continue their 13 years warranted education, in Puttalam Zahira National College, was held recently at the A H M Aswar hall. This session had been arranged under the chair of the school principal H.A. Jabbar.
This 13 years warranted education scheme has been introduced to the central government schools by the Education Ministry to provide career guidance for the students who have got low results in their G.C.E O/L examination.
Deputy principal S R M Muhsi, the teacher in charge of the SMART classrooms M I M Akbar and a SMART classroom teacher A H M Azhar conducted the session.
The new SMART classrooms system was also officially launched on the same day. Parents of these children gifted flower pots to the school at the event.
