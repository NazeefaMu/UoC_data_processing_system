Committee work on electoral delimitation to conclude by October 31

Provincial Councils and Local Government Minister Faiszer Musthapha instructed the committee appointed to inquire into appeals on delimitations to conclude the process by October 31.
This was consequent to a request to the minister asking for further time.
Political parties, civil organisations and the public had directed nearly 2,000 appeals regarding issues in the delimitation report gazetted in August last year. Minister Faiszer Musthapha appointed a committee representing all the political parties in Parliament.
According to the Committee, 90 percent of the process has been completed and handed over to the Department of Survey to demarcate the newly delimit boundaries in the map.
