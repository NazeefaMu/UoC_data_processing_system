Homemade Harry and Meghan dolls for sale!

A woman has launched Harry and Meghan dolls ahead of the royal wedding. They look a little bit like characters from 2004 action-puppet movie 'Team America' or classic show 'Thunderbirds'.
Designer Shirley Corsey has given Prince Harry slightly longer, browner hair than in real life, while Meghan Markle isn't captured perfectly, but there is a vague resemblance.
The couple do come in their formal wedding attire. Harry's dressed up in a white and gold military-style jacket. Meghan's in a traditional white wedding dress.
The dolls are 18 inches tall and available to buy on Etsy. They cost £130.
Shirley says the dolls are a "fun way to celebrate the upcoming, wedding of the year". Prince Harry and Meghan Markle are due to get married in May this year.
She adds: "I love history and current events, therefore my 18 inch doll outfits and designs for girls and boys reflect my interest. I also look for current event trends regarding what I feel Esty shoppers will be looking for, and I created and just launched for 2018 my Royal dolls inspired creations based on what will be one of the most exciting 2018 weddings for the UK and America."
Shirley designs dolls and matching clothing to fit popular culture. On her site HistoryWearz, a number of other characters feature, including a 'colonial man' and a Disney-style princess.
She hopes the royal dolls will be popular with collectors and history-lovers. They're available worldwide.
