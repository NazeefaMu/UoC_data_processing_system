Sridevi files legal complaint against producers of Vijay's Puli

After nearly three decades, Sridevi made a comeback into Tamil film industry with the big budget multi starrer Puli starring Vijay, Sudeep, Shruti Haasan and Hansika.
While the film was panned by the critics and fans expressed disappointment in Sridevi's caricaturish performance, the film managed to rake money at box office. However, all is not well between Sridevi and makers of Puli. Apparently, Sridevi is miffed that Rs.50 lakhs of her remuneration is still pending to be paid by SKT Productions. It is rumoured that Sridevi charged a whopping Rs.6 crore for the film.
Now, reports claim that Sridevi has filed a legal complaint against the producers of Puli as she is yet to receive a part of her remuneration. While official statement from Sridevi is yet to arrive, producer Shibu Thameens was quick to react to the reports. The Puli producer tweeted," Will clarify Sridevi mam complaint, postpone my surgery tomorrow and joining my partner pts in chennai."
Even earlier this year, Sridevi had sent a legal notice to Ram Gopal Varma as he had used her name as the title to his upcoming voyeuristic film. Now that Sridevi has taken the legal route to clarify the issue with Puli producers, we will have to wait and watch how this issue resolves in future. BollywoodLife
