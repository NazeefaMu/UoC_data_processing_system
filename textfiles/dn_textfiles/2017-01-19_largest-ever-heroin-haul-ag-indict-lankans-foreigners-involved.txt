largest ever heroin haul: AG to indict Lankans, foreigners involved

The Attorney General is considering indicting several foreigners and Sri Lankans for alleged smuggling of the largest ever heroin haul into the country.
Senior State Counsel Suharshi Herath appearing for the Attorney General informed Colombo High Court Judge Manilal Waidyatilleke that the Police Narcotics Bureau (PNB) has concluded its investigation and sought the Attorney General’s advice in order to institute legal action against the possible suspects. The Police Narcotics Bureau (PNB) with the assistance of the Sri Lanka Navy (SLN) seized 110 kilos of heroin on March 30, 2016 when the drugs were being smuggled to Sri Lanka through the Southern seas.
The Senior State Counsel made these submissions when the revision applications filed by three foreigners held in remand custody were taken up before Colombo High Court. The revision applications were fixed for inquiry on March 14. Sixteen suspects, including thirteen foreigners and three Sri Lankans allegedly involved in the largest ever heroin smuggling incident in the southern seas had been ordered to be further remanded by the Colombo Fort Magistrate’s Court. The 10 Iranians, three Sri Lankans, a Singaporean, an Indian and a Pakistani produced before Colombo Fort Magistrate, are being held in remand custody.
