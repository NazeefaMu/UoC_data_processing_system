Social media smear campaign hurts Muslim hotels in Galle: Single Koththu misconstrued

World renowned Financial Advisor, Ziad K. Abdelnour in his book ‘Economic Warfare’ once said ‘Rumours are carried by haters, spread by fools and accepted by idiots’. This quote has aptly described the recent round of gossip spread over social media that Muslim hotels in Galle were selling food mixed with contraceptives to the Sinhalese who come to dine in their hotels.
The following is our investigation into the rumours, and not surprisingly, we found that they were fabricated and spread with little knowledge of the real story.
Tale of “Sinhala Kottu"
A few weeks ago a post on the Facebook wall of a certain individual stated that two Muslim hotels M.J.M. Hotel at Galagediya Handiya on Hiribura Road and Thalal Hotel at Thanipolgaha Junction in Galle had been sealed off and their businesses closed. The posting further warned the Sinhala community not to buy food from Muslim hotels, for food sold at these hotels had been found to be mixed with contraceptive drugs.
In another Facebook posting it was published that another hotel named Rizla at Saranthukade Junction had been closed down in the same manner- this has also been proven to be a lie.
The gossip on the post however spread quickly, many have started to believe it and business in Muslim hotels declined drastically within a very short period of time. On inquiry we heard a hilarious yet weird story about what led to such a post on social media.
Story behind the post
One night a drunk person had come to the hotel at Thanipolagaha Junction in Galle and ordered a “Kotthu” and subsequently the hotel employee placed the order with the Rotty Maker yelling out, “A single Kotthu” which meant that he needed one portion of Kotthu. The drunk man however had misheard it as “Sinhala Kotthu” due to the erroneous pronunciation of the word by the Tamil speaking Muslim worker.
The person who was under the influence of liquor shouted at the hotel staff alleging that they were selling a different kind of Kottu to Sinhala people and left the place making various accusations and challenging legal action against the hotel.
Nevertheless, he did nothing against them, but propagated the tale which was well fostered and improved by racial elements.
When we visited the areas mentioned in the post, we could not trace any hotel which had been sealed off or closed down. When inquired from the Galle Police and Galle Municipal authorities they denied that any such incident had taken place.
A business world conspiracy?
“I inherited this hotel from my father, the late Mohamed Jasail. He ran the hotel for 35 years and handed over the business to me. By now I have been operating this business for the past 30 years. Altogether the hotel has existed for 65 years.
During such a long period in business, we have not been charged by Municipal Health authorities or any other institution for even a minor offence connected to the business.
I have six cooks employed in my hotel. Two of them are Sinhalese. In addition there are four other employees working at the hotel as well. Among them there are both Sinhalese and Tamils. Majority of my customers are Sinhala people and they have been patronising my hotel throughout. People from far off villages come to my hotel for food,” said the proprietor of M.J.M. Hotel and Chinese Restaurant M.J.M. Faizal.
They had closed the hotel from September 2 to 4 in lieu of the Haj festival and had displayed a notice regarding it at the entrance.
This however, was taken as a fact which authenticated the post on Facebook by some people and they used this opportunity to further spread the offensive and damaging gossip.
“However, the destructive story adversely affected my business. I have already made a complaint at the Galle Police. They have already initiated investigations and identified the suspects.
Galle Police have also reported the matter to the Computer Emergency Readiness Team/Coordination Centre (CERT/CC) for further investigations. I hope that I would receive justice," explained Faizal further.
U.M.G. Jagath Kumara (34), a cook at the hotel said he had worked at the hotel for over 15 years and that the ‘contraceptive' story was a complete lie.
“I too eat food from this hotel. I feed my wife and children with food here. I have three children and at present my wife is expecting again. If it was true, I would also have been infertile,” he quipped.
T.L. Karunathilake (54), another cook at the hotel added that a large number of Sinhalese came daily to the hotel for meals and the place is quite popular for having clean and tasty food.
“We do not even add Ajinomoto the famous flavour enhancer to our foods,” he added.
He further explained that his child who attended Nagoda Royal College was ridiculed in class over the incident because he worked at the hotel.
‘This is my 21st year of service at the hotel. I am a waiter here. Many of the doctors at the Karapitiya Teaching Hospital come to this hotel for food. If any harmful ingredients are mixed with food, the doctors would know. The doctors always praise the cleanliness and hygienic conditions of the hotel,” said, G. Piyasena (52) an employee of the hotel.
Muththusami Balachandran (39), from Wanduramba who has worked at the hotel for 13 years, voiced his concern as the number of customers coming to the hotel was decreasing at an alarming rate.
‘We fear that we would lose our jobs if this continues. Already two people left the hotel owing to the decrease in the number of people coming to the hotel,” he said.
Sameera Sampath (29), the Steward of S.M.J. Chinese Restaurant, joined the hotel five years ago, reiterated that the gossip about the hotel was fabricated, and that youth from faraway areas such as Mapalagama, Nagoda, and Yakkalamulla came to this hotel for Chinese food.
Further, a number of businessmen in the area also commended the hotel for its unblemished, grand services and clean food.
We also met M. Nuwaizer (39) the Owner of Rizlat Hotel at Saranthukade Junction in Galle which was said to have been sealed off for selling drug mixed food.
“I ran the hotel in a rented premises. At the end of the lease agreement I handed over the building to the owner and selected another building just opposite the former one, on the other side of the road.
I named my new hotel as Bhasha,” he explained.
Police response satisfactory
Subsequently, some persons had circulated a malicious story about the closure of my former business, he added and informed the public that the hotel was sealed off. “I had to keep it open during the day, so all could see the actual state of my former business place,” he said.
He also explained that three days ago, an unknown person threw a petrol bomb at the former hotel premises. He has lodged a police complaint CIB 253/418 dated 13.09.17.
A separate complaint has been made to the police over the Facebook allegation under complaint No. CIB 231/120.
“Galle Police swiftly initiated investigations into my complaints. They have already identified the suspects and informed the CERT/CC for necessary action to be taken.
I am satisfied with what the police have done so far,” said Nuwaizer.
The penultimate explanation over the incident came from the Southern Provincial Councillor Ven. Dr. Baddegama Samitha Thera who made a special statement over the issue.
He explained that he personally investigated the incident and the respective Facebook gossip was a premeditated commercial conspiracy targeting the Muslim business community in Galle by some chauvinist groups.
