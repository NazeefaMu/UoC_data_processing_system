Army to obtain Yan Oya sand deposit or be auctioned

The special committee to look into the ways the sand deposit at the proposed Yan Oya reservoir construction site in Anuradhapura could be used, recommended that 100,000 cubes of sand be handed over to the Sri Lanka Army or be sold at a public auction, Anuradhapura Government Agent R. B. Wanninayake said.
He was addressing the Anuradhapura District Agriculture Committee meeting at the Kachcheri auditorium, recently.
He said the Yan Oya reservoir sand deposit should be used appropriately. The GA added that steps were taken to ascertain the full capacity of the sand deposit with the assistance of relevant departments.
"We will dispose of the deposit appropriately. A portion will be provided to villagers for construction work. At present, the Mines Bureau had stopped issuing sand permits due to malpractices taking place in the issuance," the GA said.
Meanwhile, residents in Welioya, Wahalkada and Pamburugaswewa demanded to take immediate steps to renovate the roads in the area damaged due to the transport of sand by heavy vehicles.
