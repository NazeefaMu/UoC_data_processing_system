Badulla prone to landslides


About 66.9 percent of the land area in the Badulla district is prone to landslides, according to latest reports of the Building Research Institute, said Uva Provincial Councillor Samantha Vidyaratne.
Vidyaratne has drawn the attention of the Uva Provincial Council and the Central Government and requested them to take measures to prevent natural calamities. He said landslides in hilly areas in Uva slopes had been a common feature. Several large scale landslides have been reported during the last few decades.
He said Sri Lanka had been included in the minor earthquake prone areas in South Asia following the 2004 Tsunami.
