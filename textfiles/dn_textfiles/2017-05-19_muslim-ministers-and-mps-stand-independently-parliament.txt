Muslim Ministers and MPs to stand independently in Parliament

 
Muslim Ministers and MPs who met this morning to discuss a 'common strategy' to 'approach the President and Prime Minister' on the recent attacks faced by the Muslim community, warn that they choose to sit independently in Parliament if the Leaders do not take action to rein in extremist groups in the country.  
According to a post shared on the Minister of Muslim Affairs and Postal Services, Abdul Haleem's Facebook profile,  the Muslim legislators met at his ministry. Their focus has been the recent increase in activity by the Buddhist group; Bodu Bala Sena (BBS).
Over the last week, a series of incidents such as the attack on the Kohilawatte mosque in Sedawatte by an unidentified gang have led the MPs to believe that the BBS might be involved though the attackers are yet to be identified and apprehended. 
A source at the meeting speaking to Daily News said that they have sent a letter requesting for a meeting with the President and they hoped that they will get an appointment before the President leaves the country on Tuesday.
