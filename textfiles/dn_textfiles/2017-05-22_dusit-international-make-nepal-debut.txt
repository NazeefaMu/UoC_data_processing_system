Dusit International to make Nepal debut

Thailand-based, global hospitality company Dusit International has signed a management agreement with Omstone Asia Capital Nepal Pvt. Ltd. to operate Dusit Thani Himalayan Resort & Spa, the first Dusit-branded property in Nepal.
Located in the heart of Nepal’s central region, just over an hour’s drive from Kathmandu and Tribhuvan International Airport (KTM), the luxurious mountaintop resort will comprise 44 well-appointed guest rooms and 20 exclusive villas, each providing magnificent views of the majestic Himalayan range.
Leveraging the natural beauty of its surroundings, with pristine air and good weather year round, the new property will have a wellness spa concept created by Dusit’s signature Devarana Spa, which provides luxurious, personalized treatments designed to promote emotional and physical well-being. Other facilities will include an all-day-dining restaurant, a bar and lobby lounge, meeting facilities and a swimming pool.
Namo Buddha, a small village which houses the ancient Thrangu Tashi Yangtse Monastery, one of the most important Buddhist pilgrimage sites in Nepal, is less than ten minutes away by car. Dhulikhel, the administrative centre of Kavrepalanchok District, whose old town is home to many Hindu shrines and Buddhist stupa, is also located nearby. The extension of the highway which links Dhulikel to Kathmandu is expected to complete by 2020, reducing travel time from the capital to the resort to under 45 minutes.
“Dusit Thani Himalayan Resort & Spa brings wellness and well-being to the fore in a magnificent setting that invigorates the mind, body and soul,” said Ms Suphajee Suthumpun, Group Chief Executive Officer of Dusit International. “In keeping with our brand promise to uniquely deliver gracious hospitality to the world, we will do all we can to ensure our destination resort has a positive impact on the local environment and community, and we look forward to making it a huge success.”
