Express Weekday Lunch at Colombo City Centre

The Atrium by Food Studio, located on the 3rd floor of Colombo City Centre, launches its Express Weekday Lunch deals, available Monday to Friday between 11am to 3pm.
Outlets serving up authentic Sri Lankan, Indonesian, Japanese and Singaporean cuisine will have delicious combo meals running throughout the week. From Katsudon sets and authentic Hainanese Chicken Rice and Soup to Singaporean Teppanyaki, Sri Lankan Rice and Curry, and delicious Indonesian Chicken Opor rice sets – Food Studio promises a lunch spread where variety is key.
Given the Colombo City Centre’s strategic location to a number of offices and organizations in and around the Nawam Mawatha area, it is expected that the launch of Express Weekday Lunch will provide some much needed culinary therapy.

Hosting spectacular terrace views of the city, Beira Lake and Indian Ocean, Colombo’s lunch date with Food Studio is already set.
