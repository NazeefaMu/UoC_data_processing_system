Lanka Property wins ‘Best Website’ at SLT Zero One Awards

Sri Lanka’s leading property website LankaPropertyWeb.com, was awarded the ‘Best Website’ under its relevant category at the inaugural SLT Zero-One awards, which recognises achievements within the country’s digital sector.
This being the first awards programme the company has participated in, its win is a particularly significant achievement.
Launched in 2007, LankaPropertyWeb.com was initiated with the intention of assisting Sri Lankan property owners and agents reach a wider local and global audience, allowing them to sell and rent their properties much more efficiently. Additionally, it was also setup to serve as a platform for property seekers worldwide, to locate properties for purchase and rent in Sri Lanka.
Over the past decade, the company has done exactly that, proving to be instrumental in the field of real estate, assisting scores of real estate agents, sellers, renters and buyers secure their ideal property and amassing the highest number of property ads and visitors to the site, making it the No.1 property site in the country.
Their resounding success has a great deal to do with their expansive and fully-functional website, which needless to say, also saw them as the clear winners for this award.
Commenting on the award, Daham Gunaratna, the founder and Managing Director of Lanka Property Web said, ‘Whilst the user-friendly setup of the website is undoubtedly one of the key reasons for the win, there are plenty of additional traits that helped contribute to this accolade. For starters, the website was enhanced and developed based on user feedback that was meticulously accumulated and assessed over the past 10 years. Needless to say, this has allowed us to tailor the site according to the needs of customers and make it easier for them to search and post properties. We are greatly honoured that the distinguished judging panel at the Zero-One awards have recognised our achievements, and presented us with this prestigious award.’
There are continuous enhancements done to the site, such as expanding search by radius, the ability to search properties near you using GPS, and the ability to directly share pages via Viber and Whatsapp.
Lanka Property Web has taken into account every detail, which has paid off, seeing as how visitors were shown to spend an average of 8 minutes on the site with each visit. They also boast an average of 6 leads per property ad, which is quite above the industry average.
