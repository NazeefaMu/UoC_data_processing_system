Delay of billions in tax Refunds slows India’s exports

Four months after India’s biggest tax overhaul, traders are still waiting for 500 billion rupees ($7.7 billion) they say the government owes them in refunds, leaving them short of operating capital as overseas sales suffer.
“It’s an alarming situation,” said A. Sakthivel, regional chairman of the Federation of Indian Exporters Organisation in southern India. "Our working capital is stuck, we’re losing revenues and now we’re having to let workers go." More than 10,000 workers have lost their jobs in the Tirupur export hub that employs half a million in the state of Tamil Nadu, according to Sakthivel.
India’s exports dipped for the first time in 15 months this October, falling 1.1 percent to $23.1 billion, even as the government tinkered with ways to simplify the hurriedly implemented nationwide goods and services tax. While last month’s trade deficit widened the most in three years to $14 billion, exports are expected to fall further in November if prices of crude oil, India’s biggest import, continue to climb, traders say.
The decline in exports combined with the slowing of India’s $2.3 trillion economy contrasts with the accelerating global economy. With elections due in key states over the next few months, including Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s home state of Gujarat -- India’s second-most industrialized state with annual exports worth $60 billion -- his government faces the twin challenges of restoring business and saving informal sector jobs.
Nitin D. Wakankar, a spokesman in the commerce ministry, didn’t respond to calls seeking comment.
