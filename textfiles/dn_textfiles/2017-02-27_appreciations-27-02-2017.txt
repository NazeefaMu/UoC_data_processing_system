[APPRECIATIONS - (27-02-2017)]

Albert Clarence Fernando
Live wire of Moratuwa St. Sebastian’s
It's 20 years since Albert Clarence Fernando entered eternal glory to be with his maker. February 11, 2017 was his 20th death anniversary. He was the chief of the clerical staff of St. Sebastian's College, Moratuwa, which was also my alma mater.
He was a very loyal old boy of the college, a very active member of the college OBA, as well as a live wire of the college Teachers’ Guide for many years. During his period of tenure, he served the college administration without any fear or favour.
Albert was the energetic Treasurer of the OBA for over 15 years continuously, Vice President of the OBA, President and Treasurer of the Teachers’ Guild, member of the Welfare Society during very difficult days of the college, and also served in almost all committees in various capacities, holding responsible positions in serving his alma mater. In all projects organized by the OBA to raise funds for the college, he was the one and only person who was entrusted with the responsibility of handling large sums of money collected from the public. I well remember that at the several carnivals organized to raise funds, he was there in the office till the early hours of the morning. In whatever capacity he worked, he gave his very best in performing his duties.
Albert, who was always smartly dressed in immaculate white, was also one of the members of the college staff. At the same time, he was one of the earliest to arrive and commence work for the day, patiently and silently.
Likewise, he was the last to return home after work, often after 5 pm. His integrity and dedication to work entrusted to him was unique.
He never looked for positions or other perks, but discharged his duties without leaving any loopholes, for the betterment of the college. He gave his whole-hearted co-operation to all the Rev. Directors under whom he worked.
Albert Fernando was one who always stood by the La Sallian Brothers. My association with him began from my school days, and I would say very proudly that he never uttered a word to hurt the feelings of others and was extremely courteous and kind to all those who came to seek his assistance.
May his soul rest in peace in the presence of his maker!

Dr. Quintus Corea
Treasured doctor
Quintus Corea was born to Edith and Dominic Corea on the September 26, 1925. As his name implies, he was the fifth in a family of six–five boys and a girl.
Being of a service-oriented disposition, he decided to study medicine. Having qualified as a doctor, he married Margie Alles in 1959 and had two children–Chris and Rochelle. Quintus and Margie celebrated over 50 years of marriage until Margie passed away in 2010.
Although he had only two children and four grandchildren, many in his extended family and in the community looked up to him as a father-figure. So much that he served as the Patron of the Colombo Chetty Community in Sri Lanka for many years until his death.
He was a source of great comfort when it came to medical matters and all sorts of other matters. Many confided in him, secure in the knowledge that their secrets were very safe in his confidence.
As a doctor, he was an exponent of the healing art. He treated not only the bodies but also the minds and hearts of his patients. This made him very much in demand in the social circle. When someone was ill, the first question would be “Has Quintus seen him yet?”. Many patients would say “Quintus came and now I feel much better”. His bedside manner and diagnostic skills were legendary, and he epitomized the concept that the practice of medicine was not just a science, but also an art.
Many visited our home to seek his advice and he would also visit family members, friends, and neighbors at all hours of the day or night to sort out medical problems.
His earnings came only from his meager salary as a Government and Local Government doctor. Although he did not earn anything else from the practice of medicine he acquired immeasurable goodwill in the community in return for his selfless service.
His passion for pets was also legendary. He had all manner of bird and beast as pets, including deer, sambur, donkeys, ponies, porcupines, rock squirrels, and his favourite which survives him–his African grey parrot Chico. This passion for pets was prevalent amongst all his brothers and periodically there was much excitement in the family when one of them had a new addition to their menagerie.
He loved the outdoors and took great pleasure in visiting his coconut estate where he would show us some large and prolific fruit trees and proudly say–“all these trees were planted by me.” The estate was also invaluable in housing the larger members of his menagerie.
Tennis was another passion. He would be out on the tennis court at the Otter’s almost every day with his many friends–some of whom are present here today. This was usually followed by a quick beer. He continued playing tennis until Margie’s passing in 2010–a period of over 60 years. Although he tried to get back into the game again, this was not to be as age had taken it’s toll.
Afterwards, his source of entertainment was playing cards with Margie’s sisters and their friends. I am sure that the presence of her sisters reminded him of her, and he enjoyed their company immensely.
It is very hard for us to manage without his constant, caring, steadfast presence.
I used to visit him in his room in the evenings and share a drink with him. He was a man of few words, and although we enjoyed much fellowship and exchange of news most of this took place with a minimum of actual conversation. This interaction had a therapeutic effect on both of us and I will be facing the vacuum created by his absence for the rest of my days. Although he was absolutely alert mentally, I realized that at 91, I would not have the privilege of his company, love, and guidance forever. So, I tried to make the most of it at the time.
A few days before he passed away, he must have had some premonition because he asked me to stay with him while the rest of the family went on a small trip.
I should have guessed that there was something significant in this as he is usually undemanding to a fault. His medical skills may have led him to realize that his own life was nearing its end. His heart which had beaten for him and for his vast extended family for 91 years was reaching the end of its life. Even the strongest oak must ultimately fall.
Always a meticulously religious person, he would attend mass dutifully on Sundays. When he became less mobile, he witnessed mass on TV conducted in Latin.
He greatly appreciated the Latin mass as it brought back to him memories of his childhood. A few days before he passed away, Rev. Sr. Barbara who is known to the family for over 50 years, administered holy communion to him whilst he enthusiastically uttered the appropriate responses in Latin. We entrust Daddy to the caring hands of his creator and thank God for giving him to us for so long.
He joined the company of Mummy once again, and this may account for the flicker of a smile that lit up his face in the end. Our Father, who art now in heaven Hallowed be thy name.

William Henry Samaranayake
A great educationist
The passing of William Henry Samaranayake, retired principal of St. Bernadette’s College, Polgahawela, in 1969, removed a great educationist and social worker of this country.
His activities were directed to the welfare of students, many of whom rose to power and distinction. When he took over St. Bernadette’s College, it had but two cadjan huts to house its students. Through his perseverance, the college grew in land and magnificent buildings.
He was calm and collected, and a gentleman par excellence; he belonged to an age fast-sliding into history. He successfully accomplished tasks, reaching eminence in diverse fields.
His philanthropic genius enabled many unfortunates to bask in the sunshine of his warm hearted munificence and generous acts. Educationists of Samaranayake’s stamp, mettle, and genius are rare as sandalwood trees which adorn the jungles of Sri Lanka.
He will long be remembered as the great educationist who disciplined and moulded the characters of the students to be respectful towards parents, elders, and the state. Those students who now occupy occupations of dignity owe a great deal to Samaranayake.
He was also a prolific writer to the press, and his articles were directed towards creating public opinion. Three great ambitions are to be the ruler of a city, the principal of a great school, or the author of a great book. He was not only the principal of that great school, St. Bernadette’s College, but also the author of four great books: English with a Smile 1, 2, 3, and Practical English, which is almost a vade mecum and a sine qua non of students of English in Sri Lanka.
Although he has gone to eternal rest, he will live on forever in his books, which as textbooks in Sri Lankan schools, have proved, and will prove to be, invaluable guides to generations of teachers and students for years. The world lost a great educationist who was distinguished for his simplicity, integrity, and sense of duty.
His 47th death anniversary fell on August 26, 2016, and his 110th birth anniversary fell on November 26, 2016.
“We hold you close within
Our hearts and there you
Will remain to walk
With us throughout
Our lives until we meet
On that beautiful shore”

Rev Bro Michael Robert
Another legend lost
It is five years since Rev Bro Michael Robert entered eternal glory to be with his maker. March 8 will be his fifth death anniversary. He was my class teacher at St Sebastian’s College in Moratuwa which is my alma mater. Bro Michael Robert was born on February 23, 1936 and his parents were late Bastian Santiago and late Magilin Fernando. He was admitted to the juniorate from St Mary’s College, Chilaw in 1949 and received the Holy Habit in Penang on June 24, 1952.
He taught and worked at St Sebastian’s College, Moratuwa, De Mazenod College, Kandana, St Benedict’s College, Kotahena and St Mary’s College, Chilaw. He served in different communities and held different positions as teacher, assistant Prefect of Games, Book Depot Manager, APC in-charge, class teacher, boarding prefect formator, assistant director, supervisor, vice principal and acting principal.
He was the former Director of the De Mezenod community and was in charge of the district archives. He was 76 years and had served for 60 years as a De La Selle Brother at the time of his death.
Many were the God-given qualities in his life. Looking back, in short, I could say that he was a man of prayer, a kind and a cheerful person and an authentic religious person.
Rev Bro Michael Robert was a voracious reader, an educationist, a historian, a good teacher, a leader and a strict disciplinarian. He was an example of discipline, regularity, and orderliness. He was a knowledgeable, experienced and wise person. He was a historian with a good memory and could relate to any person on any topic in a positive and inspiring way. He was courageous and hard-working, and had a preserving character.
In fact, he published some valuable books during his period of retirement. The three-volume History of the De La Salle Brothers in Sri Lanka, Deceased Brothers of the District of Colombo, Community Prayer Service – La Saccean Saints, Praying – the Rule and 75 Reflections are some of his publications. He shared his spiritual wealth where he experienced God in his life, with us. He was an evangelizer of the young and made them feel that they are loved and cared for, by making them at home.
Even during the time he was ailing, he made it a point to thank and appreciate all those who visited him.
With his passing away, the De La Salle brothers in Sri Lanka lost another legend, a devoted brother. We thank Rev Bro Michael for the inspiring leadership he gave us wherever he worked in the formation of houses, schools and religious communities. We thank him very much for touching our hearts.
“May He Rest in Peace”

Daisy David
Unforgettable teacher
It is with great grief, I pay this tribute to my beloved sister, Daisy. She was born on October 29, 1924 and was called to her eternal rest on February 28, 1983. At the time of her demise, she was teaching at Dematagoda M.V. She took a keen interest in teaching English and carried out all the duties trusted to her.
She was a member of St. Peter’s Church, Mutwal. She took part in all church activities, and enjoyed herself. Birthdays were always looked forward to by her relatives and friends. She would prepare many dishes. Her nieces and nephews were well cared for by her.
She was the one who looked after me, my sister, Ruby; and my brother, David. She made many sacrifices for the family.
She was kind, loving, and generous. She was very smartly dressed, and had a charming smile.
Life was not always easy for her, but she took on challenges with great courage and fortitude, and she had unfailing faith in the Lord. I miss her guidance and assistance and I’m comforted by the though that she is at peace in the presence of Lord Jesus Christ.
Asleep in God’s beautiful garden,
Away from pain.
Some day when our life’s journey ends,
We shall be together again.

Lucian Emmanuel Fernando
Excellent Administrative Officer
It is with sadness that I write these few lines on Lucian Emmanuel Fernando who was an Assistant Regional Manager of the People’s Bank from 1953 to 1983, and father of my good friend Terrence.
Born on January 7, 1929, Lucian Emmanuel passed away peacefully on February 26, 2003 at the age of 74 years. He hailed from a very respectable Catholic family of Katukurunda, Moratuwa, and had his entire education in one of the leading Catholic schools, namely, St Sebastian’s College, Moratuwa.
After completing his studies as a dedicated and brilliant student, Lucian brought immense credit to his school in the spheres of sports and other extra-curricular activities. He excelled as an all-round sportsman, representing the college in cricket and athletics during his time. He found employment firstly at the Bank of Ceylon, where he worked as a clerk for five years, and subsequently, at the People’s Bank, in the same capacity.
He served the bank for 30 years continuously until he retired from the banking service. At the time of relinquishing office, he had been elevated to the post of Assistant Regional Manager. He thereafter joined the private sector, as Director of Zellers Holdings and Alpex Engineering Ltd in Colombo. He was a very efficient and highly intelligent Administrative Officer, and also a kind-hearted person.
He was a faithful husband to his wife, Felicia, a loving and caring father to his nine children, and an adoring grandfather to his grandchildren. Felicia’s father, who was from Beruwala, was a very close relative of mine. However, after Felicia’s aunt’s death, we lost close contact with that family.
My association with his five sons, Laktran, Anton, Terrence, Linzy, and Sharvan began in early 1972 while at St Sebastian’s College, Moratuwa, when I was in grade seven. Laktran represented the Sebastian’s invincible 1971 and 1972 cricket team led by the legendary Sunil Wickramanayake. Another of Lucian’s sons, my best friend Terrence, worked for a short period at the Food and Beverages Department of a leading hotel in Colombo and Galle in 1978. During his last days, Lucian lived with his son, Terrence.
Lucian Fernando was the eldest in a family of three, the others being Norbert and Bernadette. His brother, Norbert, was a former all-round cricketer who played for St Sebastian’s, Catamarans Sports Club, Air Force, and Ceylon Intercontinental (now Kingsbury) during a span of 22 years.
Norbert’s wife Norma, was a retired teacher of St Sebastian’s College, Moratuwa. She was my tutor in the primary section. Her father, ‘Lawrence Sir,’ also served as an English Master in the same school.
All family members are past pupils of my alma mater, St Sebastian’s College, Moratuwa. Lucian and my father, Mervyn, were more friends than relations. He left behind three daughters and six sons. I have seen from my young days that annually, all members of Lucian’s family get-together and offer prayers soon after the St Sebastian’s Church feast. This proves the unity of their family.
Lucian had many friends, and one of them was the auxiliary Bishop of Colombo, Dr Marius Peiris, also a past pupil of St Sebastian’s College, Moratuwa. I extend my deepest sympathies to the bereaved family.
May the soul of Lucian Fernando Rest in Peace and rise in glory!

Rev. Bro. Stephen Modestus
First old boy Director of St. Sebastian’s
It is with profound sorrow that I write this appreciation of Rev. Bro. Modestus FSC who passed away peacefully on February 7, 2003. Bro. Modestus was the first old boy Director of St. Sebastian’s College, Moratuwa which was my alma mater, and in addition, he became a Director of St. Benedict’s College, Kotahena as well. Bro. Modestus served for a long period at his alma mater, St. Sebastian’s College, Moratuwa.
He hailed from Katukurunda in Moratuwa and was the son of Joseph Peiris and Inez Bastiana Fernando. He was the second Moratuwite to join the La Sallian Institute, the first being Rev. Bro. Cassim Charles. He joined the juniorate in September 1930 and after a brief period there, went to the novitiate in Penang.
In August, 1932, Bro. Stephen entered the scholasticate at Mutwal and took his vows as a Christian Brother. In January, 1934, he joined De Mazenod College, Kandana, as a teacher, and at the end of the year, he joined St. Mary’s School in the Pettah. In 1939, he was transferred to the De La Salle school to be in charge of the Kindergarten Department and was involved in various activities relating to the primary school.
He took over the St. Benedict’s College branch at Veyangoda as Principal and was also in charge of its boarding house. In 1945, he was re-transferred to St. Benedict’s College, Kotahena, as the Prefect of boarders and the junior classes.
From 1947 to 1954 he served as the Principal of the primary school, Prefect of boarders, and Prefect of Games at De Mazenod College. Subsequently, he was appointed the Principal of St. Andrew’s College, Puttalam.
In 1956, he came back to St. Sebastian’s College, Moratuwa, as the Principal of the Primary Department and Sub-Director of the College. In 1959, he became the Director, and thereby created history of a past pupil becoming a director of the school for the first time. Due to his efforts, the number of students on the roll rose to 1500 with 99% being Catholics. It was he who formed the scout troop which brought many a glory to the school.
During this period, Bro. Modestus’ winning ways earned himself the invaluable assistance from the then Parish Priest of Moratuwa, Rt. Rev. Dr. Edmund Fernando, the Bishop of Badulla. He found many ways to raise funds for the college.
In 1964, he went back to St. Benedict’s College as Head of the Primary Department and Prefect of boarders and ultimately became the acting Director.
In 1977, he went into retirement yet in 1978, returned to St. Sebastian’s College. The government too recognized the services of Bro. Stephen Modestus in the sphere of education and appointed him an All-Island Justice of Peace.
May his soul Rest in Peace. PP
C.G.Weeramantry
Luminary judge
C.G. Weeramantry was a lawyer, Supreme Court Judge, lecturer, legal consultant, and served in high office in local and international legal and academic fields. He wrote many books on important legal and religious aspects, and key topics reflecting on our society’s past, present, and future.
I’ve observed his great vision, looking at his publications and speeches delivered.
He will remain in the hearts of all who’ve loved him as a religious-minded, soft-spoken, simple person. I’m very happy and fortunate to have met and worked with him during my life, and I believe that it was a God-given privilege.
I’ve gained knowledge and important guidelines for my personal life from him.
First and foremost, my thanks goes to Dr. Rohan Perera (PC), Former Chief Legal Advisor to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Colombo, and the present Sri Lanka permanent representative to the UN, who recommended me to serve late Justice Weeramantry’s office.
I had heard the name of Justice C.G. Weeramantry while I was working as a staff member at the Law Chambers (Law library) at Hultsdorf, Colombo, and was blessed to meet and work with him many years later (more than 30 years later). I had opportunities to handle numerous valuable publications and preparations for his visits abroad on invitations received from internationally recognized academic and other organizations for orations, seminars, and workshops.
It was nice to see and read the values involved with his speeches and lectures, mostly on climate change and its effects on the world, multi-religious values, and inter-faith dialogues. Justice Weeramantry also paid a memorable visit to Theological College, Pilimatalawa, as Chief Guest for their Annual College Day, and graduation ceremony held in 2011 on an invitation from the Principal of the college. He made a fruitful speech for the graduating students.
I was happy thinking how Judge Weeramanatry was so simple although he had been a highly-recognized personality in Sri Lanka and abroad.
Madam Weeramantry was a kind-hearted lady who always supported his work as a shadow partner. Although we may not able to hear Justice Weeramantry’s voice, his name, publications, and speeches keep us alive and remind us his valuable academic life offered to all of us in Sri Lanka an abroad.
Considering his spiritual vision, one of the latest publication of his ‘Our Lady–A Fount of Inspiration’ has been recognized by the general public and the Catholic Church of Sri Lanka.
Lord Jesus has called him to rest in peace from his faithful and confident life as we mourn his passing.
