Greek New Testament papyrus found on sale on eBay

US: In January, Geoffrey Smith, a scholar of early Christianity at the University of Texas, noticed something startling: an eBay listing for an ancient Greek papyrus fragment of the Gospel of John – with an opening bid of only $US99 ($137).
“I thought, this can't be allowed to sell on eBay,” Dr Smith said. “It will just disappear into a private collection.”
He contacted the seller and urged him to halt the online auction – apparently the first on eBay for a Greek New Testament papyrus, he and other scholars said – and let him study the fragment. The seller agreed, and now Dr Smith will present his research at the annual conference of the Society of Biblical Literature in Atlanta.
The credit-card-size papyrus, which Dr Smith dates from about AD 250 to AD 350, contains about six lines of the Gospel of John on one side and an unidentified Christian text on the other.
If Smith's analysis is correct, it is the only known Greek New Testament papyrus from an unused scroll rather than a codex, the emerging book technology that early Christians, in sharp contrast to their Jewish and pagan contemporaries, preferred for their texts. That adds an interesting wrinkle, scholars say, to the story of the rise of the codex, the book as we know it today. But the dramatic story of the papyrus’ emergence also speaks to a distinctly 21st-century technological anxiety.
“The fact that this one came to light on the internet speaks to the reality for all of us who deal with manuscripts and antiquities,” Dr Smith said. “We're all trying to come to terms with these things we study – our prized scholarly possessions – are now coming up for sale online.”
Greek New Testament papyri are among the oldest and rarest traces of Christian scripture. Only about 130 have been recognised by the Institute for New Testament Textual Research in Munster Muenster, Germany, which registers New Testament manuscripts of all types and oversees the effort to reconstruct the Greek initial text from surviving variants.
They are also a new entry into the growing – and, many scholars say, ethically questionable – online marketplace in ancient papyri.
“History doesn't belong to one person,” said Dr Brice C. Jones, a papyrus expert who tracks online sales, and who wrote about the eBay listing on his blog the same day Dr Smith noticed it, inadvertently sending bids shooting up.
“Collectively, globally, it's ours,” said Dr Jones, who also communicated with the seller, who wishes to remain anonymous. “It needs to be available for research, to be put on display.”
Many scholars refuse to study manuscripts that might have left their country of origin illegally, and some refuse to study material in private collections, on the grounds that it helps drive the market.
That market is certainly robust. A third-century fragment of Romans on vellum, Dr Jones noted, sold at Sotheby's in 2014 for more than $600,000.
