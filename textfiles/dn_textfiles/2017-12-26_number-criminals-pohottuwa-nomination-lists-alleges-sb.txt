Number of criminals in Pohottuwa nomination lists, alleges SB

The Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) which will contest the upcoming Local Government election under the symbol Pohottuwa (Flower Bud) has included a number of criminals and corrupt individuals in the nomination lists, Minister S. B. Dissanayake charged yesterday. Speaking at a public event in Kandy, the Minister said, individuals accused of murder and those who threw parties to celebrate the raping of women were allegedly included in the SLPP nominations lists.
He also stressed that the Sri Lanka Freedom Party will not support the SLPP at the local bodies where the SLFP nominations were rejected.
He said views expressed by some that the SLFP will support SLPP at Local Government bodies where the formers nominations were rejected may be personal ones. Minister Dissanayake also said the SLFP unlike the SLPP has not included any disreputable individuals in the party’s nomination lists. Meanwhile, media reports said that the People’s Action for Free and Fair Elections (PAFFREL) election monitoring organisation was making arrangements to inform the Inspector General of Police about the criminals and corrupt individuals included in the nomination lists of political parties contesting the forthcoming election.
