Madonna turns 59

The Queen of Pop Madonna celebrated her birthday with her family.
The singer, who turned 59 on August 16, took all her six children - Lourdes, 20, Rocco, 17, David, 11, Mercy, 11, and four-year-old twins Estere and Stella - to Italy for the celebration, reported Ace Showbiz. The ‘Material Girl’ singer had a gypsy-themed party. She shared on Instagram a series of pictures and videos that showed her having a blast with her kids.
She wore a green skirt, corset, fishnet stockings and a hat, while her boys donned vests and her girls were decked up in floral dresses.
Rocco, who was estranged from his mother in 2016, flashed a big smile to the camera. In another image, Lourdes planted a kiss on her mother's cheek. Music News
