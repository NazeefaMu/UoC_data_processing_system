Mendis & Company in dialogue with CBSL to resolve restrictions

Referring to an article in the Daily News on February 6, under the caption 'Licence of Mendis distillery suspended', Sudath Perera Associates on behalf of W.M. Mendis and Company says that the news item is factually incorrect.
The company in a clarification says licences of W. M. Mendis & Co. Ltd. have not been suspended, cancelled or revoked and remains operative and valid currently. The company has not in any instance evaded tax payments due to the Government of Sri Lanka.
Owing to the debit freeze issued by the Central Bank of Sri Lanka on the bank accounts of Perpetual Group of Companies, W. M. Mendis & Company has not been permitted to make any payments, including statutory dues. However, W. M. Mendis & Co. Ltd. is actively engaged in dialogue with the Central Bank of Sri Lanka in order to resolve the restrictions, the clarification said.
