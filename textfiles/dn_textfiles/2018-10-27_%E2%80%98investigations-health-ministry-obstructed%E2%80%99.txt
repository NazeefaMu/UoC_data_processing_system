‘Investigations at Health Ministry obstructed’

The Investigation Unit of the Health Ministry has complained to Health Minister Rajitha Senaratne that wrongdoers in the Ministry obstruct investigations into illegal activities.
Investigation officers of the Unit have reported to the Minister that investigations at the Anuradhapura and the Karapitiya Teaching Hospitals are obstructed in this way.
Investigation Unit members were instructed to investigate corruptions and illegal activities at the Ministry at a recent meeting with the Minister. They have been instructed to use CCTV camera evidence and other modern technologies to arrest the situation.
The officers of the Unit have disclosed many such incidents at the meeting where doctors and health officers attempted to disrupt a large number of investigations.
