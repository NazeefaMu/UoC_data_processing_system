Suspension of eye surgeries: Minister refutes claim

Eye specialists at the National Eye Hospital have decided to suspend cataract operations and the eye lens attachment surgeries, according to hospital sources.
Surgeries had been stopped since Monday and many patients who had scheduled operations for the day complained that they were turned away by the hospital administration.
When the Daily News contacted Health Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne yesterday over the suspension of surgeries, he said that there was no issue and that surgeries were continuing as scheduled.
He added that the hospital had been provided with the necessary lenses for the operations and he had instructed the authorities to purchase any extra from the local area to meet any shortages.
The minister explained that he would implement the decisions needed to maintain the free healthcare system for the people no matter the challenge.
