Presidential Secretariat to intervene in drinking water projects

President Maithripala Sirisena had instructed the Presidential Secretariat to intervene in the commencement of the new drinking water projects, as well as to find suitable water sources for the implementation of water schemes.
Simultaneously, the World Bank had agreed to offer financial and technical aid, while conducting a systematic water balance study concerning 10 major river basins in the country such as the Malwathu Oya, Kala Oya; Kelani, Mahaweli, Walawe and Kalu rivers; the Deduru Oya as well as the Nilwala and Gin rivers and the Ma Oya, for arranging a database to enable the preparation of a master plan on the availability of drinking, irrigation and industrial water, parallel to the overall development boom.
Under the study, changes in rainfall patterns, protection of cascade networks and water sources, maximum water intake for drinking water projects, preparation of future drinking water sharing mechanisms and identifying water-management options, including any new water resources required with proposed catchment management measures for river basins in order to meet future water demands within the 10 river basins, would be scrutinised.
Specifically, the proposed World Bank-funded, detailed water balance study for the 10 river basins, would provide due consideration to present and future (predicted) demands of all water users, including ecological demands, a spokesman attached to the Irrigation Department's Water Management and Training Unit told the Daily News.
It had also been agreed to hold a water balance study for the Kala Oya basin, which would be coordinated by Irrigation Department Water Management and Training Unit Director of Engineer Wasantha Palugaswewa.
The Kala Oya is the third longest river in the country, which is around 145km in length, covering an area of 2,870 square-kilometres. The overall objective of the water balance study for the Kala Oya, was to review the present status of water availability in the river basin and thereby, decide the possibility of extracting 300 cubic metres of water per day, to fulfil the water supply demand in the Eppawala, Rajangane, Nochchiyagama, Giribawa and Thambuttegama water supply schemes, without compromising the water requirement of other water users, the spokesman added.
However, the proposed Kala Oya basin water balance study is yet to commence since response by the main stakeholders, namely the National Water Supply and Drainage Board (NWSDB) and the Sri Lanka Mahaweli Authority, the main users of the river basin, is slow.
It had also been decided to acquire water for the Anuradhapura North and Trincomalee-integrated mega water supply scheme from the Yan Oya reservoir that is currently being constructed in the Horowpothana and Gomarankadawala District Secretariat divisions. With regard to the Galenbinunuwewa water project, the Hurulu Wewa was proposed to be the main water source, whereas the Habarana tank is being used as the water source for the Palugaswewa water project.
It was learnt that no water source had been found to cater to the Galgamuwa water project, while the Siyabankotuwa tank had been proposed as a water source for the Puttalam City (South) water scheme.
Regarding the Mahawilachchiya water project, steps are being taken to renovate the Kudawilavchchiya tank located at the Wilpattu National Park at a cost of Rs.250 million, and the Environmental and Archaeological Impact Study reports are pending.
