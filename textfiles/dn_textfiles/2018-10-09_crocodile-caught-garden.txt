Crocodile caught in garden

A 9 feet-long swamp crocodile which crept into a home garden in Hidogama following heavy rains which lashed the area on October 7 night was caught and tied by the residents of the housing.
This was following an alarm raised by their pet dog with its barking. As the residents awaited the arrival of wildlife officials from Anuradhapura to remove the reptile and release it to a water body, curious crowds flocked around to have a glimpse of the rare visitor.
