Kamila Shamsie: 'We have to find reasons for optimism'

When Kamila Shamsie began her novel Home Fire in 2015, Sadiq Khan had yet to launch his campaign to become London’s mayor and the idea of a Muslim home secretary would have been dismissed as a futuristic fantasy. As she stepped up to receive the Women’s prize for fiction this week, both had come to pass, along with several more chilling scenarios in her updating of the classical tragedy Antigone to multicultural Britain today.
After the banker-turned-Conservative MP Sajid Javid was promoted to the Home Office, a supporter went so far as to create a twitter hashtag, #nostrashamsie. But to those who tell her that the resonance of the novel has grown exponentially since it was published last year, Shamsie briskly responds: “I’m not a soothsayer – these things were in the water.”
The Pakistani-born daughter of a businessman and a leading critic and literary historian, Shamsie has lived in London since the mid-noughties. Two years before starting work on the novel, she became a British citizen, “so I was very aware of what was going on around citizenship and how easy it was to fall between the cracks. Until then, each time I signed a form for residency renewal I was incredibly tense: what would have happened if I had ticked one box wrongly?”
The ancient Greek play on which Home Fire is based tells the story of a princess who is forced to choose between obeying the king, who is her uncle, or burying her brother, whose body has been left to rot as punishment for waging war on the kingdom of Thebes.
Shamsie’s Antigone is Aneeka, one of three Muslim siblings, whose twin brother has travelled secretly to Syria to film Islamic State fighters in Raqqa. While their older sister tries to protect the family by reporting him to the police, Aneeka embarks on a cloak-and-dagger campaign to force the Muslim home secretary to allow her disaffected and frightened brother back into the UK, against government policy.
The idea came about through “one of those funny confluences of events”, Shamsie explains. Her previous two novels, Burnt Shadows and A God in Every Stone, had been sweeping historical investigations, and she was keen to write something set in the present day that did not require a lot of research. “I was ready to write but not sure what.”
In this creative hiatus, she met a theatre director who pointed out that there was a revival of interest in Greek tragedy and suggested she take a look at Sophocles’ Antigone. “My thought at that point was, let’s do something to fill the time,” she says, but she was struck by how pertinent the story seemed. Mohammed Emwazi, the British-born Isis executioner also known as Jihadi John, had hit the the headlines, along with a succession of stories about young British runaways who had dedicated their lives to religious war.
