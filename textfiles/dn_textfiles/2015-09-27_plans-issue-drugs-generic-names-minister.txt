Plans to issue drugs in generic names - Minister

Arrangements will be made within the next two years to issue drugs to patients in generic names, Health, Nutrition and Indigenous Medicine Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne said.
Addressing the gathering after launching several state hospital development projects in the Kalutara district recently, Dr. Senaratne said that he had made a request to the UN to include dengue and CKDU controlling and immunization into the 17 UN Development Goals to be launched on January 1, 2016.
“We introduced the Prof. Senaka Bibile Drug Policy and I am very happy about it, because I am one of his students,” he said. Dr. Senaratne pointed out that the total coverage of the National Immunization Programme in Sri Lanka is 99 percent which is on par with the US. Australia has only 92 percent of coverage. Immunization is still an issue for many other countries in South East Asia.
“Unlike in the past, we have five years ahead of us to develop the country’s free health service. In the past, we had only 100 days to achieve our targets.
“During the next five years, we will develop infrastructure facilities in the health sector and upgrade the free health service,” he added.
