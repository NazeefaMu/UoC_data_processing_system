GOODS DISTRIBUTION AHEAD OF POLLS
Galle GA warns Govt. officials

Galle District Secretary S.T. Kodikara yesterday warned his officers that those who work with politicians to distribute goods during the election period will have strict disciplinary and legal action taken against them.
He told the Daily News, that since the election period has now been declared, a government officer can in no way involve a politician in the distribution of goods funded by the Central Fund.
“It has to be carried out by the government officer. If at any point, a politician not contesting the election participates in an event, then representatives of all parties need to be invited to the event. In addition, any speech given by them cannot promote a single party or candidate standing for the election, Kodikara said.
He stressed that he will be taking legal and disciplinary action against government officers who do not adhere to the election laws during this period.
The District Secretary’s stance comes in the backdrop of Former Secretary to the President and senior most government servant of the previous regime, Lalith Weeratunge having been found guilty in September this year of misappropriating Rs 600 million worth funds belonging to the Telecommunications Regulatory Authority to distribute Sil cloth to devotees during the last Presidential election.
