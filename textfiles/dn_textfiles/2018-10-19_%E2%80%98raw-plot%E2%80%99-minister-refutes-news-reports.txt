‘RAW plot’: Minister refutes news reports

Ports and Shipping Minister Mahinda Samarasinhe refuted media reports that President Maithripla Sirisena had made reference to the involvement of Indian intelligence agency RAW in the alleged plot to kill him and the former defence secretary.
The Minister was speaking at a media conference at the SLFP headquarters yesterday.
He added that the President did not utter a word relating to the alleged plot to assassinate him or accuse RAW in this connection at the recent Cabinet meeting.
Asked why such news appeared in the local and foreign media, the Minister said that it may be a result of certain persons who want to create a clash between Sri Lanka and India.
“This can be an action taken purposely by a certain group aiming to create unrest between the two countries. Sri Lanka and India have long been friends and certain persons may want to harm the relationship,” the Minister said.
The Minister said that an investigation should be done to ascertain who is behind the spreading of such news. This matter will definitely be discussed at the next Cabinet meeting.
He added that the Cabinet Secretary, President’s Media Division and the Foreign Affairs Ministry issuing three separate statements have vehemently refuted the news that such a statement was made by the President during the Cabinet meeting. The Minister said at the National Economic Council meeting President paid attention to the non-essential items imported to the country. The President asked for a report on the imports and highlighted the need to increase local production rather than importing.
Speaking on the reorganisation of the SLFP, the Minister said that the report produced by the committee appointed to furnish proposals to reorganise the party was unanimously approved by all members of the Central Committee. According to those proposals there is a suggestion to appoint a politburo in addition to the Central Committee. The President then noted that there should be an amendment to the party constitution to appoint a politburo to the party.
