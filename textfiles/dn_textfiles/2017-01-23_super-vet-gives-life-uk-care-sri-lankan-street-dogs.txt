Super vet gives up life in UK to care for Sri Lankan street dogs

A supervet who gave up life in the UK to rescue street dogs in Sri Lanka has saved 5,000 animals.
Janey Lowes, 28, helps dogs with ­problems ranging from mange and ticks to rabies and machete wounds.
She said: “So many are in such a bad way, I’m amazed they’re alive. I am in surgery every day but a lot of it is also about showing them compassion. I feel these are all my dogs and I have a responsibility to them.”
Many have been injured in traffic accidents and need amputations, while others have been attacked by locals with knives or had boiling water thrown over them, as they are viewed as vermin. Janey, whose story shown on BBC’s Inside Out tomorrow, said: “Dogs here are not seen the way they are back home.
"Even when they are owned, the majority are used as guard dogs, tied up on a chain in the heat or kept in a crate 23hours of the day. So on top of treating dogs, we are aiming to educate people.”
Janey, of Bishop Auckland, Co Durham, is also trying to curb the number of ­unwanted puppies, as 60 percent ­die ­before they are fully grown. Her neutering programme has made a big difference.
When she arrived, 40 percent of dogs in the area were bald with mange. This is now below five pe cent. Most days, she jumps in a tuktuk and tours around looking for dogs. It is a 24-hour job and she sees animals seven days a week.
Janey, who won Vet of the Year at last year’s Daily Mirror’s Animal Hero Awards, moved in 2014 after a ­backpacking trip. She said: “I’m well-travelled and have seen lots of street dogs but Sri Lanka was another level. I couldn’t walk away.”
She set up a practice in an empty school and now has 20 staff members. They rely entirely on charity donations.
She has taken in five dogs herself, ­including two-week-old Ralphie, who was the only surviving pup in his litter and had a head wound filled with maggots.
She said: “I trained as a vet as I want to help animals. Here I wake every day ­knowing I’ll do something worthwhile.”
