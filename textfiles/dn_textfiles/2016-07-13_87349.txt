Wallaby playmaker Cooper quits Toulon

 
Australian playmaker Quade Cooper on Tuesday confirmed his departure from Toulon, just a year after signing from the Reds.
“Goodbye. Thank you for everything. I will miss my brothers and family that I now have in Toulon... See you soon,” the 28-year-old Cooper said on his Twitter account.
Cooper failed to settle at Toulon, struggling to nail down a starting spot and was often criticised after failing to fire.
