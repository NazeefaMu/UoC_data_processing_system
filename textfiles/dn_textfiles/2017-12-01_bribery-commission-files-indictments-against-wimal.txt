Bribery Commission files indictments against Wimal

The Bribery Commission yesterday filed a fresh corruption case in the Colombo High Court against former Minister and National Freedom Front (NFF) leader Wimal Weerawansa, for the alleged unlawful acquisition of money and assets, estimated at Rs.75 million within a period of six years while serving as a Minister, during the former regime.
The Director General of the Commission to Investigate Allegations of Bribery or Corruption alleged that the former Minister had committed this offence by way of undeclared assets between January 1, 2009 to December 31, 2014. The indictments had been filed under 39 counts based on monitory and property transactions estimated at Rs.75 million.
The Director General alleged that the former minister had unlawfully made 26 monitory transactions, constructed a house and purchased lands and vehicles in contravention of section 23(a) of the Bribery Act. The Director General further alleged that former Minister Weerawansa had owned these properties-deemed under the provision of the Act to be property acquired through bribery.
On July 28, 2016, the Supreme Court decided not to proceed with a writ petition filed by Wimal Weerawansa, who sought an Interim Order preventing the Bribery Commission from serving indictment in the High Court, against him ,over assets investigations.
The Supreme Court had observed that there is no legal basis to issue notices on the respondents including the Chairman of the Commission to Investigate Allegations of Bribery or Corruption.
The Bribery Commission had initiated an assets investigation against MP Weerawansa based on a complaint by Attorney-at-law Namal Rajapaksa.
