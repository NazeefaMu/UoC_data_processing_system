Paracetamol proves deadly sweet

A four-and-a-half year old boy who had mistakenly eaten Paracetamol tablets thinking it was peppermint died on Tuesday morning, in Maskeliya.
He was identified as Sri Manokrishnan Merdi of Nottingham Group, Maskeliya. Reports said the boy’s parents who noticed that he had consumed the painkiller, had rushed him to the Dikoya Base Hospital, along with the sample of the tablets. Although hospital authorities transferred him to the Nawalapitiya hospital after giving him initial treatment, the boy died there. The postmortem examination was due to be held at the Nawalpitiya hospital yesterday.
