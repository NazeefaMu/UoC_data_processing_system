Temple can guide people on solar energy: Siyambalapitiya

Since the temple offers guidance to people as a centre of attraction in the villages, they can be encouraged to use solar energy for domestic lighting by providing solar energy panels to viharayas as a pilot project, Power and Renewable Energy Minister Ranjith Siyambalapitiya said.
He was addressing a meeting held to mark the installation of a solar energy panel at the Mangedara Raja Maha Viharaya in Ambepussa concurrent to the 'Battle for Solar Energy' launched by his ministry recently.
Siyambalapitiya said: “we are engaged in a vital battle for solar energy. We have a responsibility to obtain the optimum possible level of the country’s electricity generation from local sources."
He said: "We are producing half of the country’s electricity requirement from coal and fuel. This entails a heavy drain of foreign exchange. This is a grave problem. But we have many other cheaper unutilised power sources such as water, wind and solar power. Producing electricity through them will be cost effective. As a country in the tropics close to the equator, it will be more profitable for us to produce electricity from solar power. We are late in this endeavour. It is to catch up with lost time that we have launched the battle for solar energy. We will be able to have roof top solar panels in one million houses countrywide."
