Four-century old charm

William Shakespeare has become a domestic term in Sri Lanka, despite his obscure works. He is the widest known English playwright in the world scene as well. How could one man have dominated the cultural landscape for centuries with such fame? Scribes from many plains of life share one theory to a clichéd extent: Shakespearean themes are universal.
Here is a man who lived only for five decades (from 1564 to 1616), yet his legacy has influenced the mankind for four centuries. That said, William Shakespeare still dominates the written word of English language with a metaphorical iron fist. No other writer, let alone a playwright, managed to reach even closer. If there be one, that would only be a text: the Holy Bible.
Shakespeare stands alone as the one man who dominates the literature of the world’s most used language. It is simply impressive how this single man of letters survived centuries with such reputation from the academia as well as the common man. His plays have held influence over western literature inasmuch as he is still alive today.
 A portrait of William Shakespeare is pictured in London, on March 9, 2009. The portrait, painted in 1610, is believed to be the only surviving picture of William Shakespeare painted in his lifetime. 
Thanks to a few Shakespeare enthusiasts such as Bandula Vithanage, K G Karunathilaka and Tony Ranasinghe, Sri Lankans are now familiar with Shakespeare’s well-received plays: Othello, Hamlet, The Twelfth Night, The Merchant of Venice and Romeo and Juliet.
The world knows him more as a playwright and less as a poet. Above anything of that sort, Shakespeare was a writer. Was he in possession of a secret formula to become the most celebrated writer – something like a magic potion? Probably, or probably not. Shakespeare’s own quotes throw some light towards us.
Have more than thou showest; speak less than thou knowest. (King Lear: Act 1, Scene 4, Page 6)
Give every man thy ear, but few thy voice. (Hamlet: Act 1, Scene 3, Page 3)
In two plays and two different lines, Shakespeare lays emphasis on one point: pay attention to what others have to say more than your own. He would have been a silent listener, extracting the juice as well as essence from gossip that others feasted on.
There is more to Shakespeare’s script though. He deconstructed the ancient text into plainer and more enchanting style of his times. His language is plain? That may sound eccentric at this age when everyone needs a paraphrased edition to understand the Bard’s lines. It is still not far from possibility, if you have a general command of English.
You can still understand Shakespeare, only if you care to bury your head in these lines written four centuries ago. Take a breath while reading his sentences, which in turn will offer you breathtaking proverbs, phrases, metaphors, idioms and any figure of speech you name.
He continues to cast a spell on the western thinking, probably only second in rank to the Holy Bible. Even with no typewriter in possession - let alone modern word processors - he penned about 37 plays and 154 sonnets. That figure is colossal, in contrast to the short lifespan Shakespeare had. Shakespeare filled his text with inspiring characters. One modern playwright is inspired by the ‘Fools’ in Shakespearean plays. Another playwright would re-interpret the famous Shakespearean characters.
William Shakespeare was not the only playwright of his time. He had a fair share of contemporaries.
They outsmarted him as well at times. Yet, Shakespeare was left to be the only scribe best remembered in western literary sphere. How and why are researched extensively across the globe.
Shakespeare had an amazing knack for capturing the human essence in his sources. To borrow from his own glossary, he fed the readers with milk of human kindness. The dramatist within him took liberties remoulding his sources into universal human experiences. That is how his plays have varied plots. Shakespeare syringed the power of creativity into words of his predecessors.
That earned Shakespeare wrath too, from his contemporaries.
The Guardian cites a diarist who was born 11 years after Shakespeare died. The diarist was an academic who looks down on Shakespeare and notes that the only good thing is that ‘his plays took well’. The diarist’s account aside, the literary circles are not short of scholars who maintain that Shakespeare was not much of a writer. There could be some truth to their verdict, as the Bard had contemporaries like Christopher Marlowe who claimed better scholarship.
Along with the diarist’s account, the Guardian also publishes an interesting note:
“For a man famous in his own lifetime there is little documentary evidence for Shakespeare’s life and times. The plays would scarcely have survived if his friends and fellow actors had not gathered together every scrap of every play they could find - drafts, prompt scripts, scribbled actors’ parts, and 17 plays not known in any other version - into the precious First Folio published in 1623, seven years after Shakespeare’s death.”
Now that is the surprising part about this much-spoken-of man of the 20th century. But then he was born in a period when information power was toddling.
The universality is not merely a concept when it comes to Shakespeare. His plays influenced more and more creative writers, who remoulded his plot outlines. That happened mostly in cinema and tele media. Romeo and Juliet, for instance, inspired many versions of the same plot. That reached somewhat a crescendo with Leonardo de Caprio carrying a gun. Examples are aplenty where Shakespeare has been influential, inspiring, and subject to distortion.
And today, Shakespeare is now an institution. He penned plays and poems, but the bard is extensively researched in wider scopes of literature.
Many, among you, need to enjoy Shakespeare on stage. Another group will be content with reading him between lines. For some, Shakespeare has to be visited in Stratford. What matters most though is the amazing fact that one man - a writer at that - could claim such a vast literary dominance for four centuries.
Yes, that is no go figure. Four centuries and still a living icon, Shakespeare would continue to inspire, motivate and encourage even the techno-savvy audience with his insightful expressions.
