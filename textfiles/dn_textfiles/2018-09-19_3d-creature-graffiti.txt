3D creature graffiti

Talk about graffiti today and you’ll find it has shed some of its old stigmas. In fact, the once rogue street art genre has been welcomed into the traditional art world and when you look at the work of Sergio Odeith, it’s easy to see why.
The Portuguese artist started creating graffiti in the 90’s when it was first gaining prominence in the country. He started with simple sketches on street walls and train tracks but then advanced into large-scale murals.
Odeith continued to evolve and adopted the obscure signature style, which he refers to as “sombre 3D.” This technique combines angles, lines, and shadows to create an extraordinarily life-like effect. In 2005 he gained international recognition for his anamorphic art series, which looked like something out of a science horror fiction flick, with giant spiders appearing to climb off the walls at helpless passers-by.
Not surprisingly, the Lisbon-based muralist has since been asked to design pieces across the pond in the U.S cities of Baton Rouge, L.A, Charleston and Lexington and has even received business contracts with major corporations like Coca-Cola, Samsung, and Shell. Bored Panda
