Nestle Milkmaid wins Merit Award at BestWeb.lk 2017

Nestle Milkmaid, synonymous with mouthwatering desserts, and Sri Lanka's household favourite for over 100 years, bagged the Merit Award for 'Best Advertising and Marketing by a Website' at the recent BestWeb.lk 2017 Competition.
Milkmaid shone among the rest of the Food and Beverage (F&B) brands, as it was the only F&B brand to have won an award in the competition.
Vice President Dairy Ruwan Welikala said, "Milkmaid has been a trusted and versatile dessert ingredient for generations. Our sweet treat search engine has made the brand even more appealing to its digitally savvy consumers ensuring that the sweet treats they love can be found in one easy-to-use platform. We are deeply honoured to have been recognised by BestWeb.lk for the hard work put in by our Milkmaid and Marketing Services teams, as well as our agency partner, Publicis to make Milkmaid.lk what it is today."
Milkmaid is Sri Lanka's first mobile friendly dessert-making digital platform that shares appealing three-step recipes and do-it-yourself videos by recipe name, occasion and cooking time to easily make the perfect Milkmaid treat.
The platform has increased the brand's share of attention among its target audiences, delighting even the most difficult to reach consumers. Milkmaid also has the largest fan base in Sri Lanka in the F&B category for its Facebook page.
BestWeb.lk 2017 is the most prestigious competition held for Sri Lankan websites. Conducted for the seventh time since 2009, it recognises the best websites developed and maintained by companies over a wide range of industries in Sri Lanka. Milkmaid is made from the highest quality fresh milk, collected from 21,000 Sri Lankan dairy farmers. It is manufactured at Nestle's state-of-the-art factory in Kurunegala, upholding the high quality standards Nestle is renowned for across the world.
