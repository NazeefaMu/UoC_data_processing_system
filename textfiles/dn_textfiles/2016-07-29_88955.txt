Pallekele happy hunting ground for Mendis

 
Pallekele International Stadium it seems is a happy ground for Kusal Mendis who scored his maiden Test century on it yesterday taking on the Australian bowling by the scruff of its neck to give Sri Lanka a whiff of victory in the first Test.
Thanks to Mendis’ brilliant knock of 169 not out Sri Lanka who were wobbling at six for two at one stage ended the third day at 282 for six wickets – a lead of 196.
“I’m very happy today because I scored my maiden first-class century here in Pallekele and also my first Test hundred at the same venue today,” said Mendis.
“The Australians have a very good bowling attack but we played them better in our second innings. When I walked into bat, I clearly knew what my role was going to be. I stuck to my plans and just did what was required.
“I didn’t try to go in search of runs. Just tried to understand how the wicket played and try to accumulate runs with singles,” he said.
Mendis said Australia losing one of their front line bowlers Steve O’Keefe to a hamstring injury made batting a bit easier.
“He was their main weapon against the right-handers. I think his injury affected their game plan. From our point of view, I was more comfortable against the offie (Nathan Lyon),” said Mendis. Reaching his maiden Test hundred with a six Mendis said was not a pre-determined shot.
“I usually play the sweep and at that moment, I just felt to go for that shot.”
By reaching his maiden Test hundred with a six Mendis became only the second Sri Lankan batsman to do so after Aravinda de Silva who did it 31 years ago against Pakistan at Faisalabad.
Mendis said that he owed his success to practicing a lot and to the many people around him including the current players who come and point out his mistakes at practice and advice him on how to correct it.– ST
