‘Devolving power through constitutional reforms fully supported’

The Socialist Alliance yesterday said they would fully support efforts to devolve power to the provinces under constitutional reforms but oppose any move detrimental to the unitary nature of the country.
Socialist Alliance member, Parliamentarian Vasudeva Nanayakkara said the proposed constitution should not include any clause detrimental to the unitary nature of the country.
Addressing a press briefing, Nanayakkara said the Socialist Alliance was supportive of devolving power to the provinces under the 13th amendment.
“I do not see the need to change the powers vested with the Governor but a mechanism where the Governor and the Chief Minister could work together when making key decisions was feasible.
