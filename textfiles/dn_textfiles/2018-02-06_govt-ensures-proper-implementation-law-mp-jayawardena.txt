Govt. ensures proper implementation of law: MP Jayawardena

Today, the law is implemented properly under the good governance government and officers properly implement the law on the Treasury bond issue as well, said United National Party Parliamentarian Kavinda Jayawardena yesterday.
He added that seven Independent Commissions have been set up under this government so that officers are able to perform their duties properly. Today, no white vans abduct media personnel. MPs or Ministers do not sit in the chairs of the Police OIC.
Those days, Chief Justices were removed when they properly carried out their duties.
He said even Udayanga Weeratunga had been arrested by the Interpol and he would be sent to Sri Lanka soon. So no one is above the law, he said.
He was responding to a query made by a media personnel during a press conference held at the UNP party headquarters - Sirikotha.
MP Jayawardena said Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe’s plan is to hand over the country to the future generation after developing the economy.
“Today, the wealth of the country is the human resource,” MP Jayawardena said. “The Premier is of the view that much focus should be placed on education. That is why the Mahapola scholarship was increased by 50 percent. Earlier, only Rs. 109 million was allocated for the Mahapola Scholarship. But it has been increased to Rs. 912 million. A thirteen-year education was made compulsory. Steps were taken to introduce the Suraksha Insurance policy to all students around 4.5 million in number. They get a cover of Rs. 200,000. Further, the government was able to develop schools under the concept of the ‘Langama Pasala Hondama Pasala’.
He said smart classrooms would be set up, while laptops and tabs would be granted to students. He added that the National Youth Council is now free from political influence and is available for youths to develop their skills.
The Premier had spent Rs. 4 billion through his ministry to create an environment suitable for youths to engage in self-employment.
MP Jayawardena said Rs. 10 billion of SME loans had been allocated for self-employment. For the year 2018, Rs. 15 billion has been allocated for that purpose.
The government has been able to identify around 150 small-scale industries to be granted with loans. The government has increased the recruitment to universities by 20 percent.
The allocation for universities expenditure had been increased by two folds from Rs. 414 million to Rs. 832 million.
The government is spending Rs. 325 billion for education. We grant Rs. 25 billion for local government institutions for the construction of roads while Rs. 35 billion is spent under the Central government, MP Jayawardena said.
