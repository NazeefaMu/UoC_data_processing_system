Dinesh requests special debate over prevailing emergency situation

MEP Leader Dinesh Gunawardena yesterday requested a special debate in Parliament over the prevailing emergency situation in the country due to floods and landslides.
He urged the Prime Minister to convene a special sitting of Parliament next week to discuss this matter.“We are deeply concerned over the prevailing situation. Life rescue missions are going on. Loss of lives, a possible spread of various diseases leading to a possible epidemic and damages to property and businesses have been reported in many parts. Therefore, we urge the Prime Minister to facilitate an urgent debate on the national disaster situation,” he said.
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe proposed to wait for a complete report from the Disaster Management Ministry to proceed in this regard. “I have ordered the Disaster Management Minister to produce a full report. Let us have this discussion based on this report,” he said.
At this point, the Prime Minister in rather a sarcastic tone reminded that such a disaster would not have taken place, had not the Joint Opposition smashed coconuts at Kovils.
State Minister Sujeewa Senasinghe rising to a Point of Order requested Joint Opposition MPs to go to the field and assist the affected people, adding that holding a debate in the House would not be of any help for relief distribution work.
He said the Government has decided to pay compensation for all damaged houses irrespective of whether those are illegal constructions or not. MP Gunawardena at this point stated that they do not require any invitation to go to the ground and assist the people.
