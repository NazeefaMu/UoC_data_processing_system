Top tips for growing healthy roses

A lot can be said for a healthy rose bush, and the sight of blooming roses in your garden really will brighten your mood each day. There are two very important factors when planting roses to make sure you give them the best chance to thrive – firstly, make sure they are in the right growing conditions and secondly, plant them properly. Once you’ve got that right your roses will have a much better chance of thriving.
1. Plant your roses in full sunlight – be sure that they never have less than four hours sunlight on them each day or you will notice reduced flowering.
2. Never consider growing roses in areas with a cold draught or in waterlogged ground.
3. Enrich your soil with organic matter, such as well-rotted manure, and plant your roses there. This will give them the best chance to thrive.
4. Before planting a rose bush, prune back all the branches to about 15cm (6in) in length to concentrate the plant’s energies on producing a strong root system.
5. Most roses prefer well-drained, neutral soil, and flower best on fertile, clay soil.
6. Roses are greedy, so for best results plant them in rich soil, mulch annually with compost, seaweed or manure, and feed in spring and summer with a proprietary rose fertilizer.
7. If you spot the first signs of black spot then make sure you treat it right away by removing diseased foliage and burning it.
8. Train climbers up sturdy supports, ensuring unrestricted air flow around the foliage to deter mildew.
9. Deadhead your rose bushes regularly to encourage more flowers to grow, leaving late blooms to form hips.
10. Pruning is essential for flowering, but varies depending on type, so ensure that you check what your rose bush will require when you buy.
