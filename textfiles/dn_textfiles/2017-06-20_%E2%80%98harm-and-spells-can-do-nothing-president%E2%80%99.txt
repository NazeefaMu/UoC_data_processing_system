‘Harm and spells can do nothing to President’

No damage could be done to President Maitripala Sirisena by so-called callous means of harm and spell as long as he enjoys the love and faith of masses, Southern Province Chief Minister Shan Wijayalal De Silva said.
He made the above assertions in response to a question raised by the media regarding certain rumours spread over the country about harm and spell stories connected to the President these days.
Since ancient times, people of the country believed in harm and spell practices. In the contemporary society also, there are sections of people who trust these occult practices.
However, no harm could be done to any politicians who have won the real and enduring love and faith of public. President Maitripala Sirisena is such a political leader who is greatly loved by the people. He is well-protected by people’s love and affection against any forms of harm and spell Chief Minister observed, the minister added.
President has obviously declared that he could not be discouraged or dispirited by such mean occult practices.
Owing to such malicious schemes, President becomes more fortified and resilient in his forward march. No one can stop him in his firm robust political journey, he said.
