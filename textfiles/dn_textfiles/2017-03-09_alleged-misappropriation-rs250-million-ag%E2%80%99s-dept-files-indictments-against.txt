Alleged misappropriation of Rs.250 million   : AG’s Dept. files indictments against Basil, Nadeshan

 The Attorney General’s Deparment yesterday filed indictments against former Economic Development Minister Basil Rohana Rajapaksa and businessman Thrikumar Nadeshan for misappropriation of Rs.250 million by purchasing and developing a 16 acre plot of land in Malwana.
Attorney General Jayantha Jayasuriya, when contacted by the Daily News said the indictments were filed against them before Gampaha High Court yesterday under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act.
The plot of land was believed to have belonged to former Economic Development Minister Basil Rajapaksa, bought using public funds, but he denied ownership of the land. Meanwhile, the FCID informed court that they have forwarded the investigation notes regarding the case for the Attorney General’s perusal, Rajapaksa recently filed a fundamental rights petition before the Supreme Court seeking an order preventing the FCID from arresting him over five magisterial inquiries under the Prevention of the Money Laundering Act.
Earlier, businessman Thirikumar Nadeshan who was allegedly involved in this land deal was arrested by the FCID when the latter arrived at the FCID to record a statement. He was later granted bail by the court.
