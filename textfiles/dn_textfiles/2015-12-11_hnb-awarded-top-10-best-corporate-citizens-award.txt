HNB awarded Top 10 Best Corporate Citizens Award

Hatton National Bank (HNB) was once again selected as a Best Corporate Citizen under the Top 10 category at the Best Corporate Citizens Sustainability Awards 2015 organised by the Ceylon Chamber of Commerce.
The awards ceremony, held on 26th November 2015 at the Cinnamon Grand Colombol, saw the 'Sustainability Stars' of the Corporate World being recognized for their untiring efforts to adopt Best Sustainability Practices in their business processes.
Environmental management, environmental integration, environmental value addition, employee relations, customer relations, community relations, governance, financial performance and economic contribution were some of the stringent evaluation criteria for this 'sustainability' award.
As one of the foremost financial institutions in the country, HNB has proved the sustainability of its operations through existence in the market since its inception as Hatton Bank in 1888. Today, the Bank has demonstrated sustainability through diverse initiatives which are directly linked to its core business activities, to make a greater impact on the country and the communities in which it operates.
HNB's renowned micro-finance product 'GamiPubuduwa' is one of the greatest steps in the industry towards social sustainability. A number of customers who obtained micro finance loans under this scheme over a period of 25 years, have now grown into SME or corporate level and make significant contributions to the country's economy.
The Bank has been partnering the progress of these customers not only through financing the startups and expansions, but enhancing their capacity through workshops to improve financial literacy of micro entrepreneurs , training programs for SMEs and facilitating buy-back schemes etc.
The NenaPubuduwa School Library project which currently stands at 200 libraries and 15 computer centres in some of the most rural schools in the country, is another initiative by HNB that supports nurturing Sri Lanka's future generation with knowledge.
Financial assistance to cancer patients as well as facilitating trauma counseling, investments in hospital projects, water and sanitation projects, HIV Aids awareness campaigns etc. are HNB's contribution towards community health.
