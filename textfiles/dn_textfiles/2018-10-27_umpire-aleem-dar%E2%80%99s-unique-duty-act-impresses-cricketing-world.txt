Umpire Aleem Dar’s unique on-duty act impresses cricketing world

It was almost like a pilot leaving the board after all had evacuated. Pakistan umpire Aleem Dar recently set such a high standard while on duty that the entire cricketing world has lauded him for his sense of responsibility.
The 50-year-old umpire though had his share of controversies in the past but his latest act during an ODI game between Sri Lanka and England will certainly do his reputation as an umpire a world of good. It all happened during the fifth and final game of the recent series played in Sri Lanka. It was a dead rubber at R Premadasa Stadium in Colombo as England had already won the series. Sri Lanka won the toss and put up 366 for 6 in 50 overs. England had a bad day at the office and were completely off target. They faced a batting debacle and were 132 for 8 after 26 overs, still having a mountain in front of them to climb. Off-spinner Akila Dhananjaya came out to bowl the 27th over and on the very first delivery, he found tail-ender Liam Plunkett plumb in front of the wicket after the latter failed to read the googly. After pitching outside the off stump, the ball hit him on the right thigh, betraying the batsman’s hope that it would turn.
Dar was the umpire and he gave it out. Plunkett then referred for a third umpire’s decision but in between the technicalities, the skies opened up, as it in all the matches earlier. The decision was so correct that Plunkett had no option but to return but then something unique happened.
All the players had left the ground as the rain and thunders increased but Dar stood his ground, waiting for the verdict from upstairs. Finally, the fans saw in amazement that Dar left the field with his dreaded finger raised, confirming the decision he received from the reviewer. Plunkett was dismissed and England were 132 for 9 in 26.1 overs, losing the game by a whopping 219 runs as per the Duckworth-Lewis Stern method – their heaviest defeat in the 50-overs format. crictracker
