Singapore-SL yoy trade up to $1.4 bn

Sri Lanka’s newest Free Trade partner in the world, itself a major economic hub, hinted its ambitions to leverage the new Sri Lankan economic partnership as a springboard towards the rising South Asian market.
“Many Singapore businesses see Sri Lanka as a gateway to South Asia” announced President of the Singapore Chinese Chamber of Commerce & Industry (SCCCI) Roland Ng yesterday in Colombo. SCCCI has 5,000 corporate members and more than 160 association members, who in turn represent over 40,000 companies across various industries. President Roland is in Colombo leading a 30-man Singaporean business delegation to Sri Lanka. Among the delegation are both listed and unlisted (but well established) firms. Also joining the evening was Shamil Mendis, President of the Sri Lanka-Singapore Business Council.
“Singapore Companies can share their experience, insight and know-how with their Lankan counterparts. Due to their own business approach and practices gained in the overseas market. This is not a case of one-sided change and interaction. Started in 1906, the Singapore Chinese Chamber of Commerce & Industry (SCCCI) is the apex business chamber of the Chinese Community in Singapore.
With these connections and network, we can help to link up business opportunities abroad with S’pore companies. We partner with our government agencies to organise many initiatives, activities for our member companies. This is to transform, and improve their capacities to spread overseas.
This approach helps for Singaporean businessman to get to know well about Sri Lanka before coming here on business. SCCCI always played a role of introducing opportunities to Singapore businesses. Last year, Sri Lanka-Singapore total bilateral trade was at US $ 1.4 billion, surging from 2016’s $1.1 billion. The trade balance is in favour of Singapore at a 5.3 import to export ratio. Despite this, year on year exports have more than doubled last year-from 2016’s $108 million to $221 million in 2017.
Analysts say that SLSFTA is Sri Lanka’s first Free Trade Agreement that covers government procurement, and Singaporean enterprises can bid for Lankan projects.
