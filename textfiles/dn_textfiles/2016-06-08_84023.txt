School curriculum to undergo massive overhaul
The school curriculum will undergo a massive overhaul to suit modern requirements, Education Minister Akila Viraj Kariyawasam said in Parliament yesterday.
He was participating in an adjournment motion moved by JVP MP Bimal Rathnayake on the problems of the education sector.
He said a new school curriculum would be introduced to offer a job oriented and knowledge-based education system. He said a committee headed by Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe sits twice a week to discuss revisions to the education sector. He said changes to the education system have been proposed in a futuristic manner.
He said unemployment among youth will be solved under the new system.
“We provide internationally recognised training to Principals. We are in the process of training 4,000 principals. There were 6,768 vacancies in the cadre of principals. We held an examination to fill them. We received 21,000 applications and 19,000 sat for the examination. Four thousand passed the exam. There was no political interference in this regard,” he said.
The minister said the number of students in a class has been limited to 40, adding that this would be brought down to 35 by 2020.
Replying to a charge by MP Bandula Gunawardena that the number of admissions for commerce courses at the National Colleges of Education have been reduced, the minister said the step was taken as there were limited vacancies for the subject. He said the new criteria adopted to recruit students for the National Colleges of Education helped to recruit 1,250 students more.
“Whenever we propose a change to an system, criticisms flow. This was the same for the voucher system introduced in replace of school uniform material. However, many said the new system is good. Likewise, the new set of criteria for the enrolment of the National Colleges of Education will also be praised later,” he said.
Attempt to get political capital through grapevine - PM

Taxes will not be increased further this year. The tax burden will be reduced by the year end, Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayake told in Parliament yesterday.

SAITM standards far better than those of State Medical Faculties - SB
Facilities and standards of the academic staff of the SAITM are far better than those of the Medical Faculties of Colombo, Peradeniya and Ragama Universities, Social Empowerment and Welfare Minister S. B. Dissanayake told in Parliament yesterday.
He was participating in an adjournment motion moved by JVP MP Bimal Rathnayake on the problems of the education sector.
Former Higher Education Minister Dissanayake who granted the degree awarding status to the SAITM, challenged to compare the facilities
and staff of the private medical institution with those of other medical faculties in the country.
He said the Higher Education Minister has the power to veto the Sri Lanka Medical Council (SLMC) decision.
“These students have gone to court. We hope they will mete out justice. Students with 3S at the Advanced Level Examination from areas such as Kilinochchi and Manner had been admitted to state medical faculties. The SAITM does not have such students. It has students in urban and semi urban areas who could not afford to spend about Rs. 30-40million for a medical degree,” he said.
He said the SLMC did not hesitate to recognise the medical degree of the Kothalawala Defence University and was even ready to amend the Act to recognise it, the minister said.
Cabinet paper to make Tamil proficiency prerequisite for public sector recruitment
The National Dialogue Ministry has formulated a Cabinet paper to make Tamil language proficiency a prerequisite for recruitment to the public service, Minister Mano Ganesan told in Parliament yesterday.
He made this observation in reply to a question by UPFA MP Douglas Devananda under the Standing Order 23 (2). He said the Cabinet paper
has been taken up at a Cabinet Sub-Committee.
He said even though Tamil language proficiency has been made compulsory for all public servants by a Circular, it has not been properly
observed.
“The National Language Policy has not been implemented properly over the past years. It was a dead document when I assumed duties, but I have taken measures to put it into practice. We have paid attention to make Sinhala and Tamil language proficiency compulsory at least in areas where both the languages are widely used,” he said.
He said measures have been taken to recruit 500 Tamil speaking individuals to the Police service, adding that they would be given appointments in the North and the East. Commenting on language issues in Court, the minister said if the judge could not understand Tamil, a system in which the defendant could ask to take up his case before a panel of judges who can understand Tamil would be introduced in the future.
Higher Education Minister to comply with SC verdict
Higher Education Minister Lakshman Kiriella yesterday in Parliament said that he was waiting for the Supreme Court verdict on the matter of recognition for the SAITM medical degree adding that he would oblige by the decision.
He was taking part in an adjournment motion moved by JVP MP Bimal Rathnayake on the problems of the education sector.
“We hope the Supreme Court will sympathetically look at SAITM students’ issues and come up with a solution that will protect the standards of the medical degrees. We have to look into the fate of these students. The court will take a fair decision,” he said.
The minister said the Medical Faculties of the State Universities had admitted students with 3S from rural areas.
“At the same time those who had obtained 2As and 1B in areas such as Galle and Kandy had been unable to enter into the university. SAITM students have gone to court. We hope they will meet out justice by the court,” he said.
The minister said those in the Joint Opposition must be responsible for the issues of the SAITM students. However, he said the same group is against recognising this medical degree.
UPFA MP Ramesh Pathirana proposed to introduce the Act 16 exam for those who pass out from private medical institutions.
The minister said a system to receive online complaints would be introduced by December to prevent ragging in universities. He said the university system has been accorded freedom and independence without political interference.
He said independence would be strengthened by presenting a Bill in Parliament. He said the hostel issues of the university students would be solved by 2018, adding that financial allocations to the Higher Education sector have been increased by 50 percent under the present government.
