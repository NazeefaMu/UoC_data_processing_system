Programme to donate organs of brain dead patients to be introduced

The government has taken steps to introduce a national programme to allow brain dead patients donate their organs for transplant purposes.
Brain dead patients who are on life support, could donate their organs for organ transplant operations for those in need. This system has been in operation around the world. Kidneys, hearts, liver, lungs, sections of the bowel, sections of the eye, skin, veins, tendons, bones, valves in the heart and pancreas, are all possible organs that could be donated. A Cabinet Paper put forward by Health and Indigenous Medicine Minister, Dr. Rajitha Senaratne, however, asked that a national programme and mechanism be set up to permit citizens to express whether they wish to become organ donors after their death.
The Minister had earlier proposed that people be allowed to state whether they are organ donors or not when obtaining one’s drivers’ license and that would be indicated in one’s license. This however is a voluntary gesture and officials at the Motor Traffic Department have been known to make no effort to inform applicants of this option. At present, close to 750 - 1,000 people die each year, without their organs being harvested for better purposes. Motor vehicle accidents which have a high rate of brain dead patients, have approximately 2,500 people die of accidents in Sri Lanka every year.In countries such as Australia, France and Lebanon, a national database of donors have been set up, permitting hospitals quick access to organs when they are ready.
They also allow people to register with this national database through the internet, phone and SMS services.
