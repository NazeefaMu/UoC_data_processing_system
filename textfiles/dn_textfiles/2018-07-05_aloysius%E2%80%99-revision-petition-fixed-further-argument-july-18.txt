Aloysius’ revision petition fixed for further argument on July 18

A revision application filed by Perpetual Treasuries Limited (PTL) beneficiary owner Arjun Aloysius and its Chief Executive Officer Kasun Palisena seeking an Interim Order to release them on bail was yesterday fixed for further argument on July 18 by the Court of Appeal.
Senior Additional Solicitor General Yasantha Kodagoda PC appearing for the Attorney General made oral submissions citing that there is no illegality in the order made by the Magistrate of Colombo Fort regarding suspects' bail.
When the matter came up before Court of Appeal (President) Preethi Padman Surasena and Justice Shiran Goonaratne, the matter was fixed for further argument on July 18.
The suspects were remanded in connection with the controversial Central Bank Bond issuance.
Arjun Aloysius states that by his application he was seeking Court’s Jurisdiction to the set aside order dated March 9, 2018 of the Colombo High Court in Revision Application No. HCRA 22/2018.
The High Court refused notice in the said Revision Application for affirming order dated 16-02-2018 made by the Magistrate’s Court of Fort in proceedings bearing No.B/8266/18, refusing the grant of Bail and committing the Petitioner to remand custody.
Aloysius states that he was arrested and produced before the Magistrate’s Court of Fort on February 4, 2018 and committed to remand custody by the Magistrate’s Court of Fort on February 4 and February 16 and thereafter, at the behest of and on the strength of further reports filed by the Criminal Investigation Department, in connection with an investigation commenced upon a complaint dated 25-11-2016, made by the Governor of the Central Bank of Sri Lanka.
President's Counsel Gamini Marapana with counsel Navin Marapana appeared for Arjun Aloysius.
