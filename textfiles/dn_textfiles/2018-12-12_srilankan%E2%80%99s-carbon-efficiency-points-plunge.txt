SriLankan’s carbon  efficiency points plunge

Carbon Efficiency points (EPs) of SriLankan Airlines declined to 55.6 points in 2018 from 56 points in 2017 according to the ‘atmosfair Airline Index’ which ranks and compares the carbon efficiency of the 200 largest airlines of the world.
The British TUI Airways was placed first in the ranking as in the previous year, reaching under 80% of the feasible optimum of low CO2 emissions. Fourth place went to its German counterpart TUIFly. The German airline has consistently been at the top in the atmosfair ranking since 2012. With Condor another German holiday flier made it into the top 10 (72 out of 100 efficiency points).
This tool enables passengers to compare airlines offering flights to particular destinations and choose the airline that produces the least CO2 emissions.
The formula contain for every flight the aircraft type, engines, winglets, seating and freight capacity as well as load factors for both passengers and co-loaded freight.
Carbon emissions from airlines grew by about 5% last year, while the number of kilometres flown increased by 6%, according to atmosfair, showing that much more needs to be done to ensure aviation does not take up an unsustainable amount of the world’s remaining “carbon budget”.
