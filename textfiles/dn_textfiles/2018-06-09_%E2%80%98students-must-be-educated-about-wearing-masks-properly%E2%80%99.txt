‘Students must be educated about wearing masks properly’

Certain organisations in Matara distribute protective masks to students and I appreciate it very much, Matara Consultant Community Physician Dr. N. Y. Samaraweera said. “but some times, the students wearing masks may infect others if they do not know how to use a mask properly,” he said.
The Matara Health Services District Director. Deputy Director, the Matara General Hospital Director and other health authorities are in the same view. Persons suffering from Acute Respiratory Illness (ARI), cough, cold or fever must wear a mask to prevent others from the virus. Persons in the high-risk groups should use a mask whenever they are in public places, they said.
Dr. Samaraweera said students should be instructed to use the masks properly. Otherwise, they will put others at risk. “Children touch their face more often and adjust their mask and hold their noses which is risky. Using a mask worn by another is also risky. they must remove the masks they wear properly. the doctor said.
The Health Services Department is carrying out awareness programmes about these matters throughout the year. A circular issued in mid-May has instructed all government and private medical institutions on how to control a RTI outbreak and every institution had followed our instructions, he said.
Health Services Deputy Director Dr. Deepika Patabendige said the media and health officials should corporate to make the public aware of in this regard
The circular specifically requested that all health education units of hospitals should carry out health education for OPD patients, in-ward patients, health staff and for visitors.
Matara Health Services Director Dr. A D U Karunarathna said a downward trend of patients being admitted RTI symptoms, fever and cough to government hospitals and private hospitals is evident now.
