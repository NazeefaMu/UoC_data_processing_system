Written as if in a trance

Those of us who are interested in Lankan English Literature are familiar with the profile and works of the internationally celebrated prolific writer, Jean Arasanayagam. But the relatively less known husband of her, popularly known as Arasa, is an equally brilliant playwright and poet. He was one of the winners of the prestigious Gratiaen Prize. The couple live in Kandy. Parvathi, one of their daughters, is also a poet.
In his well-constructed book of 16 poems within 66 pages, White Lanterns: Wesak 2011, T Arasanayagam gives us a medley of his varied felt experiences he had had. The writer is an English teacher.
In his acknowledgement, he says: To my family for the continuing encouragement in all literary endeavours and for the trust and belief they have in my talents and potential as a creative writer.
His talents as a creative writer are now proved by the publication of the book.
Let us see what his poems tell us and how poetic is his endeavour.
The opening poem, Mother, is a beautifully compressed account of Hindu funeral rites. In this, a rebellious son succumbs to the tradition.
For the information of the non-Hindus, I give below some aspects of the last rites as narrated by Arasa:
Holding flaming torch behind,
go round thrice, they tell me,
don’t look back but forward, they tell me,
now stop, face away walk backwards holding torch behind, they tell me,
and I in a trance hear a voice distant, exhorting,
place it, place it, look not back, walk away.
Walk.
Crackling dry wood touching my senses,
and I led away from burning pyre,
duty done with an umbilical tug of conscience ashes to ashes,
words reverberate
as urn flung onto ocean
tide will carry her away back to the elements as will I in time,
going back to Brahma, from whence I came.
His second poem is both nostalgic and the present, using the bird Koel’s (Kuyil in Tamil) sad song on the plight of the displaced but ends the poem with a positive note as singing your song of hope for the displaced.
Even though I am a Hindu, I feel jealous over Arasanayagam’s selective words to describe another Hindu act of worship in his poem, Pooja to Saturn. Please read it yourself as I want to save space in this review.
Arasanayagam writes about his observations and experiences of his youthful days in such an authoritative manner as a Tamil who has not forgotten his roots and cultural traits.
This attempt serves the useful purpose of telling others via the English medium some aspects of Tamil culture in Lanka.
He liberally uses Tamil words that in turn would educate the non-Tamils to equate the meanings of the words in their respective languages.
An Elegy to an IDP is a telling commentary on the immediate past where most of us in the North and East encountered.
The title poem to the poet concludes with this stanza:
The Spirits of the Dead
I see them now,
white in the darkness
moving, floating, flying,
and waving their whiteness
in the ocean of Darkness, Spirits of the Dead.
Please read rest of his poems as well. I like the freshness of thought, although the bitterness in the poet’s life overwhelms over some positive things in life, and of course the employment of creative use of language. Thiagaraja Arasanayagam should continue to write more poems and fiction.
