Commenting on the Group’s inclination towards making mid to long term investments, Deshamanya D.H.S Jayawardena, Chairman of Aitken Spence PLC stated, “we have been quick to identify new investment opportunities where we can diversify to remain relevant in the present business context. Catalysed by our investment model, we seek strategic partnerships with global partners that would provide a competitive edge in the markets we intend to serve. Aitken Spence PLC reported a profit attributable to shareholders of RS. 2.9 billion, a rise of 43% while earnings per share also rose by 43% to Rs. 7.12.
“Despite challenges faced from external factors by some of the key sectors, the Group had a commendable year of performance, commented M J.M.S Brito.
“Over the years we have invested to build robust businesses underpinned by strong fundamentals. Our presence in diverse sectors has been the cornerstone of Aitken Spence PLC’s success, cushioning the Group during times of economic adversity. In the year under review, we switched gears and accelerated the pace to reach the next phase of our growth agenda. Uncertainty becoming the new normal for many of our businesses, our purpose for the year was not to be distracted by it, but rather look for opportunities that would take the Group to new heights,”.
At present, we have identified Tourism and Maritime and Logistics as key growth sectors, and have made significant strides in the current financial year to expand the Group’s footprint in these selected business domains.”
