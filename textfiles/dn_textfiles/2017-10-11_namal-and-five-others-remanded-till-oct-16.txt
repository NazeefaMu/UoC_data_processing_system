They were informed to be present at the Hambantota Police station to obtain a statement in connection with the protest that was held on October 6.
The protest held in Hambantota was against a proposed joint development venture by the government with overseas stakeholders from China and India to develop the Mattala International Airport and the Hambantota Port.
The protest was held in Hambatota on Octomber 6 despite a Restraining Order issued by the Hambantota Magistrate against it.
Police dispersed the protest as the protestors attempted to enter the Indian Consulate by force. Three Provincial Councilors, Upali Kodikara, Sampath Athukorala and Ajith Prasanna are also among those arrested yesterday.
