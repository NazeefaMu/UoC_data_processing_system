HDFC Bank signs MoU with SANASA Insurance

HDFC Bank recently signed an MoU with Sanasa Insurance Company Limited in respect of granting life and total permanent disability insurance protection to the bank’s loan customers. This will be a value-added service which would provide further financial security to the loan customers of the Bank and their families.
Palitha Gamage, Chief Executive Officer/General Manager of HDFC Bank and Wasantha Premalal Perera, Deputy General Manager of Sanasa Insurance Company Limited signed on behalf of the two organizations.
The association with Sanasa Insurance Company Limited will provide the HDFC Bank’s loan customers with the best-in class products and services beyond the normal loans.
Accordingly, in case of an untimely demise or total permanent disability of a Bank’s loan customer, the loan repayment will not be an additional burden to his/her loved ones.

Together we will provide value added services to our mutual customers while mitigating risks to our customers and the bank.”
