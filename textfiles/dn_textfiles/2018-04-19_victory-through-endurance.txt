Victory through endurance

The hard work, the discipline, the achievement, the pride added to it all would be hope and anticipation to reach greater heights. Young endurance athlete, Ashwin Doranegama finds himself on the move, aiming for victory, one after the other.
Doranegama, 21, took part in the recently concluded Iron Man 70.3 in Colombo and was placed second in the 18 – 24 age category and thirty first out of the 850 participants. The 70.3 Iron Man consisted of a 1.9 kilometre swim, 90 kilometre cycle and a 21 kilometre run. Doranegama’s finishing time for this race was 4 hours 53 minutes and 16 seconds. He was the youngest athlete in this event.
“It came up as a bit of a surprise,” said Doranegama. “I was not expecting it, actually.”
“My passion for this sport started after I took part in an Ironman 70.3 contest in the Men’s Open Relay category in Subic Bay Philippines in 2017,” he said. At this particular contest, Doranegama contributed in the run leg and his team won the first ever Gold for Sri Lanka for the Open Men’s Relay category. “Just by witnessing the event, feeling the atmosphere, I got sucked into the sport,” he elaborated.
In September, 2017, Doranegama entered the Olympic Distance Triathlon at the Singapore International Triathlon. Olympic Distance race consists of a 1.5 kilometre swim, 36 kilometre cycle and a 10 kilometre run. He was placed second in the 18 - 24 age category and was placed 26th out of 673 competitors.
Doranegama has been swimming since the age of four. In school, his events for nationals were the 50m, 100m, 200m, 400m and 1500m freestyle. “Swimming was quite intense. We had about 11 to 12 sessions a week. Because of that, getting the discipline for this kind of training is not too hard,” Doranegama explained.
In 2015, he started pursuing marathon. He did his first half marathon in 2015 and second in 2017. His first full marathon was done in 2016.
His fastest half marathon was concluded in one hour 28 minutes whereas his fastest full marathon was completed in three hours 30 minutes.
“Waking up in the morning is challenging, sometimes, because you’re tired after your previous session,” said Doranegama. “Making up your mind to get out of bed is the most difficult because you’re hurting and you’re tired. I think, everyday, waking up is the biggest obstacle.”
“Training alone is another challenge, I face sometimes,” he said further. “It’s hours and hours, training alone. I like to train with company, so, I don’t feel the time go by.”
In terms of rest, you need to sleep on time, stated Doranegama. Forty per cent of the work is done by training, the rest is all what you eat –how much you eat and how much you rest. Rest is like one of the most important things.
“My Mom and Dad support me a lot. Dad said ‘if you’re not doing it properly, don’t do it, at all.” recalled Doranegama. “My coach Rajan made sure I was on track, doing all the sessions, and if I didn’t get something right, I had to do it the next day. Until I achieved what he wanted me to do, he made me do it for weeks. There was a time when I had to repeat the same thing for eight weeks,” Doranegama remembered with wonder. “It was tormenting but, I guess, that’s what builds up the confidence and mind-strength. My ambition in terms of triathlon is to basically try and get more athletes of my age to start the sport by just simply showing that it can be done if you put in the time and effort,” he stated.
“There’s very little eagerness among people of my age for triathlon,” he remarked. “Outside Sri Lankan forces, it’s very little. Athletes are good in this sport when they’re aged 25 to 40. But it’s not bad to start now so you gain the experience you need for those years to come. We need more athletes doing triathlon, especially in my age.”
“I think people don’t do this sport because they’re scared how much it’ll hurt. And I think you need to give in to the pain and not be scared of it,” he said further.
Doranegama has been qualified to represent Sri Lanka in the (18 – 24) age group category at the Iron Man 70.3 World Championship in South Africa this September. The Iron Man 70.3 World Championship in South Africa is a race limited to qualified participants. Approximately 6,000 athletes from all over the world will be participating in this event and it is one of the biggest Iron Man events held in the world.
The race will be held along the coast in Nelson Mandela bay and “it is said that the water is going to be cold,” anticipated Doranegama. “It’s a wet-suit race. A lot of participants, a big audience, it will be a good experience to me.
I’m excited. I can do a lot better than I did here because South Africa, for one thing, it’s cold, so, conditions will be better. The only problem will be with the altitudes. I might have to do a training camp for two to three weeks in Nuwara Eliya or somewhere high up to get used to the climate.”
There’s a lack of facilities, remarked Doranegama. “Literally, when we train, we cycle around Viharamahadevi Park. When we do our long rides, we go to places like Bandaragama, Rathnapura. Just to get out of Colombo and the traffic, you have to do a lot but if you’re living in the outskirts, it’s fantastic. And we don’t have enough experienced coaches, at all. I think, in order for the sport to grow, you have to invest in it.”
Personally I want to be able to represent Sri Lanka in world championships, commonwealth and hopefully one day Olympics, stated Doranegama. I want to be able to put Sri Lanka on the map in the world of triathlon and show that we can produce athletes of such standards. I do plan on becoming a pro athlete and I hope to take the country forward in terms of the sport.
A young personality with such enthusiasm and dedication never fails to flourish the society and to take it into high levels of success and glory. It is, indeed, a pleasant hope, an unfailing inspiration.
