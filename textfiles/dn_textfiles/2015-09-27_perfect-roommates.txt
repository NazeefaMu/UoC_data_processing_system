PERFECT ROOMMATES

Tips for a healthy indoor garden
01.Water your plants only when the potting mix feels dry to the touch - over watering is often the cause of indoor plant death. Check by pushing your finger into the soil; if it comes out without any trace of soil on it, start watering.
02. Water from the bottom
Water poured directly onto the soil may flood, or not reach the pot plant’s roots. Instead, water plants bottom up by standing them in a dish and filling the dish with water. Delicate plants such as fuchsias thrive on this method. For this method to work, all pots should have holes in the bottom through which the water is absorbed.
03. Keep away from drafts
If you don’t want your plant to die of heat or cold, avoid placing it in draughty areas or near air-conditioning outlets.
04. Plants that need lots and lots of strong light might not flower or set fruit, but they may give you enough nice greenery and fragrance to make keeping them worthwhile.
05.Plants that send out large or abundant roots may grow into smaller specimens than they would outdoors.
06. An important warning: be careful not to use plants that later become invasive weeds. (good example is water hyacinth which was brought to our country as an ornamental plant
Looks like I need to find an aspidistra. Not simply because I am a diehard fan of George Orwell whose favourite plant was probably an aspidistra, but because a kind lady in a gardening forum on yahoo, told me to do so. She was giving me advice when I wrote about the death of Twiggy. Poor Twiggy was my snake plant who had been on my desk the past six months. A few weeks ago I noticed Twiggy looked unusually dry, so I gave her a bit of water. Then a bit more. Then one day she shriveled horribly and collapsed like a deflated balloon, onto my desk.

When I wrote about Twiggy's tragic death and wondered what to do on the net, this unknown lady wrote, saying, “You probably over-watered it. Too much love - it's the houseplant owner's classic mistake. After neglecting them entirely, that is.” She suggested I replace poor Twiggy with an aspidistra.
I don't know where I can find an aspidistra. When I asked Eranga Lakshith, the proprietor of ‘The Garden’, who has over twenty years experience in creating indoor gardens, he didn't know, either. (This could be because I didn't pronounce the word right and he heard it as Asterix). He had better suggestions. He said to try plants like, Livistona (fan palms), Dracaena Sanderiana (lucky bamboo), and Phalaenopsis (moth orchids).

No doubt they are godsends for the “I wish I had more time!” gardener, the “I always forget to water the plants” gardener, or simply the lazy gardener. But mostly, for those of us, who are all these things as well as being the “I plant things indoors,” gardener.
Surely, if we, city-dwellers, find ourselves yearning for some greenery in our surroundings, an indoor garden is the answer - either in the form of a court yard - (a mada midulak) or otherwise. Indoor gardens would take you back to nature the way Thoreau wanted every man to live, “as an inhabitant, or a part and parcel of Nature, rather than a member of society.” Moreover, indoor plants lavish you with unexpected advantages, like cleaning the air and helping to elevate your mood. Incredibly, according to gardening experts once you know a few simple tricks, an indoor garden is easy to care for. Don't raise your eye-brows to the sky and smile; it is true. As landscape expert Eranga says, if the right amount of sunlight is there, the ‘soil setup cost’ is very low for indoor plants. So, too the amount of water a plant needs, compared to the amount its counterpart outdoors would consume.

If so, why not, invite some flowers, herbs or vegetable plants to share your living space with you? Most plants have simple needs, and as roommates go, they will be relatively undemanding.
Still, there are four basic things you need to understand before you decide to invite a plant home, though: light, water, temperature and air. If you can master these four elements, from a plant's perspective, you can create an indoor garden just about anywhere in your house.
Then again, (if you do not have a mada midulak) how would your garden grow, without the right kind of vessels to keep the trees on their feet? Should they be made of clay or cement? Should they be as big as barrels or as small as thimbles? Relax. Vessels, big or small, clay or not, are totally unnecessary for an indoor garden.

According to Lifelong organic gardner Deborah Stephenson “almost anything waterproof can serve as a pot with enough creativity.” Instead of paying for costly conventional pots, she suggests all you have to do is think out of the box and fill old handbags, boots, jugs and soda bottles with soil, “add a plant, and presto, you have a stylish new ‘planter’ you won't be ashamed to display.”
Growing your own indoor plants can be handy if you are into organic food, too. With a very sunny location, or the help of a hydroponics (growing plants without soil) kit, you can grow tomatoes, chillies and brinjals, to name a few, right in your living room or kitchen. Isn't is wonderful to grow something else other than your appetite?
If you still have doubts about the amount of light and water an indoor plant needs you can read all about it in blogs like The Worms Way where experts tell you these are obstacles that can be easily overcome. For instance, there is a simple way to decide if there is enough light in your home for an indoor garden. If you put your hand in front of the window and it does not cast a shadow, chances are the light is not adequate for most plants to live a happy life. You can always overcome this problem with artificial lights, but, if you have modest natural light in your home and do not want to fuss with special lighting, you can stick to plants that normally need low-light conditions, or try moving your garden to a sunny windowsill.

Knowing what water conditions a plant prefers, too, is a good first step to keeping a successful indoor garden. This is easier than you think because the plants themselves will often give you clues. Plants with thick rubbery leaves are water hoarders and can typically survive with less water than plants with thin, delicate leaves. If you don't have enough time to water your plants everyday, choose varieties that can thrive on less, to cut down on your watering chores.
Why waste more time? Begin today. Find some plant roommates, who will clean your indoor air, and help discover the inner farmer within you, re-connecting you with nature, one seedling at a time.
As for the aspidistra, I don't want one. But going by what Orwell says in his book, “Keep the Aspidistra Flying”, “you can get anything in this world if you genuinely don't want it,” I guess I will end up having an aspidistra growing on my desk, one day. This time around, she will have a better life than Twiggy.
Next week let’s move out of doors for a little bit of mud, little bit of digging, little bit of fuss and unlimited fun all in your backyard.
