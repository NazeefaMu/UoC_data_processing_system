Combatting wasteful consumption

Extensive and increasing use of fossil fuel across the world for diverse modes of transportation and production of electricity for domestic and industrial purposes is the main factor behind global warming which is undoubtedly one of the biggest challenges facing the world today. Though there is a small but powerful lobby against this prognosis, largely backed by fossil fuel interests, the dominant opinion on the issue is almost unequivocal. The latter is reflected in the mainstream global opinion expressed by the adoption of SDG's and the Paris agreement on climate change by the United Nations in 2015 and 2016 respectively.
Yet, what is quite uncertain is the ability of the world community to bring about the social and economic transformation required to arrest the trend towards increased global warming in the next few decades. This is due to increasingly unsustainable consumption patterns across the world, particularly in the developed and fast developing countries.
As is well known, increasing consumption creates the demand for various goods and services, which in turn leads to increasing use of fossil fuel. So, the challenge before us is not only to wean us away from fossil fuel in favour of green energy but also to reduce wasteful consumption of natural resources and diverse goods and services. Our experience shows that these are challenges that are not easy to overcome, particularly because most people do not voluntarily change their consumption patterns. So, in this article, I intend to concentrate on consumption and explore the possibilities for its reduction.
Economic growth
As is well known, economic development everywhere has been accompanied by increasing consumption of goods and services. In fact, economic development became almost synonymous with mass consumption of goods and services. While developed societies became affluent, I.e. abundance of consumer goods, most consumers tended to overconsume resulting in widespread waste of resources. On the other hand, people in less developed countries, often harbouring a sense of relative deprivation, aspired to emulate their developed country counterparts. So, when the developing countries reached a higher level of economic growth, it was almost natural for them to adopt similar consumption patterns.
A clear case in point is the adoption of car culture in the developing world in recent years. As is well known, large cities in many developing countries today are full of motor vehicles resulting in many serious problems including the increasing use of fossil fuel. Similar patterns can be identified in other areas of consumption as well with equally serious adverse consequences.
Both economic development and the spread of modern consumption over the last several decades have been guided by neo-liberal policies adopted by governments as well as global institutions. The key words here have been globalization, privatization and free trade. While national economies have increasingly come under the control of private interests, financial capital has become increasingly mobile and global. National governments have lowered taxes to attract FDI, often contributing to domestic fiscal crises. The resulting reductions in social spending has reduced the quality of public services such as education, health and public transport, encouraging the well to do to rely more and more on privately funded healthcare and private modes of transport.
Increasing use of private transport and other privately funded services, often at the expense of public provision has serious social and environmental implications. As is well known now, people living in large urban centres, particularly in the developing countries like China, India and Brazil are forced to live with serious negative effects of air pollution, slowing down of mobility due to traffic congestion and increasing road accidents. Moreover, the marginalization of public transport in the face of increasing use of motor cars by the affluent has also negatively affected the life chances of low income people who are dependent on public transport.
Environmental and health risks
Mass production and consumption of commodities have become defining features of development almost everywhere in recent years. Production of durable industrial goods such as household appliances and cars has almost become a thing of the past.
The short life span of many industrial goods not only promote the accumulation of industrial waste everywhere and poses unprecedented environmental and health risks, not to mention the mass production and use of disposable stuff ranging from plastic bags to water bottles that continue to contaminate the environment posing a threat to both humans and animals alike. A recent documentary entitled 'Plastic China' produced by a socially and environmentally conscious team in China shows the growing threat of wasteful consumption of almost all sorts of commodities and the increasing threat of accumulating industrial waste everywhere.
Those who are compelled to deal with the hazardous waste such as those employed in the recycling industries run grave risks to their own health and their families. We in Sri Lanka have seen the increasing influx of junk motor vehicles and parts into the country and the possible dangers it poses to our water ways. On the other hand, plastic bags and bottles have become a real menace, clogging water ways and polluting the environment in densely populated areas and public spaces. All well-meaning pronouncements and efforts on the part of the authorities in recent years have had little or no effect in containing the problem. We need researchers to undertake some serious research on this and related issues.
Low income population
Wasteful consumption is not confined to industrial products. As the President of the country also noted several weeks back, a considerable part of our available food is also wasted. While a significant section of the low income population shows clear signs of malnutrition, the greed of many affluent people results in obesity, besides artificially jacking up the price of rice, vegetables and fruits the poor badly needs to feed their families.
Wasteful consumption and related problems in the world are intricately connected to persisting imbalances in the global economy. Emerging global consensus on sustainable development no doubt provides a sound basis for bringing about the necessary economic and social transformation on both national and global levels. But the rising economic and other nationalisms in many parts of the world, particularly in the United States threaten to undermine this laudable global initiative that many countries have embraced.
It is in the interest of everybody, in particular the marginalized and the vulnerable to translate the accumulated wisdom and experience of many societies into concrete action by way of policies and interventions and ensure that the goals of sustainable development are achieved over the next decade or so. This is what we owe to the younger generations and those who yet to be born everywhere.
