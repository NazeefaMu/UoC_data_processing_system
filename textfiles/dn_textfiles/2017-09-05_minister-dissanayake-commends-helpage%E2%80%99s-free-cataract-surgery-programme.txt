Minister Dissanayake commends HelpAge’s free cataract surgery programme

Social Empowerment and Welfare Minister S.B. Dissanayake, during an inspection tour at HelpAge Eye Hospital recently, commended the free cataract surgeries conducted for poor and destitute elders in the country.
The visit was organized by HelpAge Sri Lanka (HASL) Communication Manager Ananda Kannangara, while HASL Executive Director Samantha Liyanawaduge briefed Minister Dissanayake about the progress of the ongoing free cataract surgery programme.
During his short stay, Minister Dissanayake visited every section of the hospital including the patients’ waiting rooms, eye examining section and the operation theatres.
The Minister also had the opportunity to speak to many patients who visited the hospital from distant areas including Galle, Ratnaputa, Matara, Anuradhapura, Polonnaruwa and Mawanella.
A 64-year-old female patient from Kaduwela told the minister that the HelpAge free cataract surgery programme paved the way for her to continue her employment in a tile factory where she earns Rs. 900 a day.
She said she got to know about the hospital from a person who had a cataract surgery from the hospital three years ago
Another patient thanked the minister for visiting the hospital and said the eye hospital conducted a surgery on his left eye and it was a dream of having such a costly surgery done free.
Minister Dissanayake, who arrived at the hospital in the early hours (about 7.30 am), gave a patient hearing to many elderly patients and their guardians and valued the free service rendered by HelpAge Eye Hospital.
Executive Director Liyanawaduge said over 30,000 cataract surgeries have so far been performed by the hospital and highlighted that majority of the elders are not in a sound financial background to have their cataract surgeries done in private hospitals.
He told Minister Dissanayaka that the hospital performs 20 free cataract surgeries everyday, with donations and assistance received from donors. HelpAge Eye Hospital Manager Ajitha de Alwis also briefed Minister Dissanayake about the free cataract surgery programme and said the hospital has so far conducted over 30,000 cataract surgeries for poor and destitute elders in the country.
