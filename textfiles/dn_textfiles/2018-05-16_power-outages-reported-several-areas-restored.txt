Power outages reported in several areas restored

Power outages were reported from many places in Colombo after a tripping of the Biyagama-Pannipitiya power grid disrupted power supply to four substations, officials confirmed.
Power cuts were reported from Ratmalana, Dehiwala, Pannipitiya and Sri Jayawardenapura. Chief Engineer at the Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) for the Dehiwela region Saumya Kumarawadu told Daily News that the 220 kilowatt Biyagama-Pannipitiya line had tripped causing the power disruption. “The issue has been looked into and swiftly resolved. The Dehiwala area received power by mid-day. I believe the head office may call for an investigation into the matter.” He said the disruption could be a maintenance issue.
