Errant group promising Italy jobs nabbed

An organised group which prepared forged documents and cheated youths by promising them jobs in Italy, was apprehended by Marawila Police.
According to the police, they had charged nearly Rs. 2 million from one person to provide their service.
Police arrested six youths including a female. They were between 20 to 26 years. The main suspect is a 25-year-old woman of Dankotuwa and she fled before being arrested.
Police also seized a car that was rented by this group.
The main suspect, who had never been to Italy, pretends to be living in Italy. She had agreed to marry the youths who need to migrate to Italy and later documents are prepared in this regard. It was revealed that she had married several youths from Marawila, Thoduwawa, Kochchikade and Chilaw. She had charged hundreds of thousands of rupees to do so.
The racket was revealed on a tip-off received by Marawila Police.
The police was told by a youth in Thoduwawa that this group prepared forged documents for Rs. 500,000. He told the police that they were coming to Chilaw to get the rest of the money and thereafter, the police instructed him to pay the rest of the money before a lawyer.
Afterwards, the group was arrested when they attempted to pay the lawyer’s fee. However, when the police tried to arrest the main suspect, she had run away with the manager of the rest house she was staying at.
Marawila Police are investigating.
