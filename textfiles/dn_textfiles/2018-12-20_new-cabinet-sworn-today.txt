New Cabinet sworn in today

The new Cabinet of Ministers will be sworn in today, President Maithripala Sirisena had announced yesterday, nearly two months after the backdrop of the ongoing political turmoil in the country.
During a meeting of the United Peoples Freedom Alliance (UPFA) Parliamentary group yesterday evening, the President had said the new Cabinet of Ministers will be sworn in today, Parliamentarian Nishantha Mutuhettigama said.
Mutuhettigama said the UPFA Parliamentary group had discussed about its future political plans but refused to divulge details.
Meanwhile, attempts to contact a member from the United National Front Parliamentary group failed as they were engaged in a meeting at Temple Trees under the patronage of the Premier.
Meanwhile, political sources said that the new Cabinet will be confined to 30 members.
On December 16, the leader of the United National Party (UNP), Ranil Wickremesinghe was sworn-in as the Prime Minister.
President Maithripala Sirisena removed Wickremesinghe from the Prime Minister’s post on October 26 and replaced him with former President Mahinda Rajapaksa.
Immediately after that, the President dissolved Parliament and called for snap Parliamentary elections.
The President’s move was challenged in the Supreme Court and the court ruled that the President’s action was against the Constitution.
Rajapaksa resigned last Saturday paving the way for President Sirisena to appoint Wickremesinghe as the Prime Minister again.
