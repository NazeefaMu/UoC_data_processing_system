Students should advance in studies to prosper country: President

 Students should advance in their studies if the country is to prosper, President Maithripala Sirisena said.
He was speaking at the centennial celebration of the Oddamavadi Central College National School after opening the new administrative block yesterday (29).
He said measures are being taken to improve the education standard of the Eastern Province and the Central Province.
“People who do not like Sri Lanka having peace are creating problems. They use a Buddha statue or a kovil or a mosque to create problems. Buddhist, Hindu, Catholic, and Muslims religions do not preach any contradictions. It is the troublemakers who bring up these issues and create problems for the country,” the President said.
“Extremists are conspiring to destabilise the peaceful life of the people. In this small country, Buddhist, Hindu, Catholic, and Muslims faiths must live amicably. Religious leaders should get together and work towards this goal.
“The Eastern Province is lagging behind in education. Though the North and East were affected by the conflict, North has improved in education,” he said.
Education Minister Akila Viraj Kariyavasam, Eastern Province Chief Minister Habiz Nazeer Ahamed, State Ministers, Deputy Ministers, Provincial Councillors were present.
