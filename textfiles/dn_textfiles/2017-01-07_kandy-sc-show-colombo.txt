Kandy SC on show in Colombo

Kandy Sports Club who got off to a flying start in the second round of the Dialog ‘A’ division rugby league with a grand 50 points victory over Army Sports Club will be on show in Colombo, when they play CR & FC at Longden Place today at 4 pm. Both teams are unbeaten in the second round and a blockbuster of a game is in store for Colombo's rugby fans. When these two teams played in the first leg match at Nittawela, the hill country club defeated the Red shirts. The side which plays the better rugby should come out winners. Fitness has been Kandy SC's forte this season. Another advantage is that the white shirts have suitable replacements for all players save for skipper Roshan Weeraratne who has been the mainstay in the side. The Red shirts are sparing no pain or efforts to win this one. They have been through a kind of training that would not be ideal for this game and the excitement is just electric. Kandy SC's pre-match mood is a happy one with all the players in peak form. The CR & FC side too should be able to address in the same manner in their home territory. The Red shirts are likely to find most of their problems coming from up-front where Kandy has shown tremendous fire. The CR & FC work up-front will not be only confining the virile young pack of the opponents, but in showing the area where Kandy SC's attack is sharpest. CR & FC has a good back division, for them it is going to be a hard evening's work.
