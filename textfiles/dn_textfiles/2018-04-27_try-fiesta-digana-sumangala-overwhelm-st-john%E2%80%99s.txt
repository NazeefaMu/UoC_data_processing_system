Try fiesta at Digana  as Sumangala  overwhelm St John’s

Sri Sumangala (St. Paul’s) College maintained their unbeaten record in the inter-school rugby season Segment – IIC competition when they scored a massive 119 points (12 goals and 7 tries) to 3 (1 penalty) win over at St. John’s College Nugegoda at Provincial Council Digana grounds yesterday.
At half time the winners led 60-0. From the kick off, the winning side entirely dominated the game, in every department, and rattled the opponents in style. With the winners dictating terms the losers were a loss to curtail the flood of tries that overwhelmed them. Nearly six players of the losing side were injured and had to be treated.
Sri Sumangala has won all four games played so far and is expected to do well in the second half of the season. They are coached by former Army and Sri Lanka player G. Gunadasa.
S. Sandaruwan refereed.
