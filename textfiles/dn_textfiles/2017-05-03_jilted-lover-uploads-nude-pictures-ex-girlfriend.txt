Jilted lover uploads nude pictures of ex-girlfriend

A youth who allegedly uploaded nude photos of his girlfriend after breaking up with her was remanded by Negombo Magistrate K. G. Gunadasa until May 12.
The suspect is a resident of Thanamalwila and is employed in a private firm in Colombo.
This youth in question has told police that he had an affair with the girl for several years and he had provided money for her educational purposes too. However, his girlfriend and parents have ignored the youth after the girl entered university.
The youth in a fit of anger had allegedly doctored his girlfriend’s photos as nude photos and uploaded them on Facebook with the mobile numbers of both his girlfriend and her mother.
