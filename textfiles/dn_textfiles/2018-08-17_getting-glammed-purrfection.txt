Getting glammed  up to purrfection

Photographers snapped cats dressed in Twenties fashion. Every iPhone in the house was out and taking videos as New York City’s Algonquin Hotel hosted its annual Cat Fashion Show on August 2. The event is a fundraiser for the Mayor’s Alliance for NYC’s Animals, which helps support more than 150 animal shelters and rescues in New York.
