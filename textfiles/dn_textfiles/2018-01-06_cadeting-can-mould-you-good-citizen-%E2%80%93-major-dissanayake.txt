Q. What is your first school?
A. I had my entire education at Kekirawa Central College from Grade 1 to Grade 13. I entered school in 1967 and the then Principal was Harry de Silva. I got through the Advanced Level Examination in 1979 and got selected to the University of Peradeniya. I passed out in 1984.
Q. Did you do sports at school?
A. I played for the school volleyball team and took part in athletics in the Inter House Meets. Our volleyball team emerged as the Provincial champions and I was awarded school colours.
But my forte was Cadeting. I was a Junior and a Senior Cadet under Lt. Lanarolle. I was a Senior Cadet Sergeant and later promoted as a Company Quarter Master and attended Diyatalawa Cadet Camp in both these formats.
Q. Did you do sports whilst at University?
A. During my university days there was no possibility at all to do sports over there due to JVP terror and the campus was closed very often.
Q. What is your first employment?
A. Actually I was interested to join the Army but my parents vehemently opposed so I got a teaching appointment as a Graduate Teacher at Medawachchiya Central College.
As soon as I assumed duties the Principal appointed me as the Master in Charge of Senior Cadeting and we attended camps for four successive years. In my fourth year I was sent to Rantambe for my Officers’ Training Course by the Sri Lanka Cadet Corps.
Q. Then what happened?
A. I did the course well and I was promoted as a Second Lieutenant and I was drafted to Lumbini Vidyalaya, Colombo and the Principal W. P. A. Perera asked me to take over cadetting. I served there for four years. Lumbini performed well under my command and I was promoted as a Lieutenant and transferred to Moratu Vidyalaya.
Q. Did you continue cadeting at MMV?
A. We were in the third Battalion and we were able to win third place. In addition to cadeting the Principal D. M. Gunadasa entrusted me to Volleyball, Athletics and Cricket.
In Athletics Vidyalians came up to the fore and always they were neck to neck with Prince of Wales’ and St. Sebastian’s. Then I was appointed as the Prefect of Games. Moratuwites are famous for cricket and I took several cricketers from the area schools which doesn’t have cricket.
Ajantha Mendis was also taken by me. Cambrian Bandula de Silva was coaching Vidyalians and he got a coaching assignment at his alma mater and I took Old Vidyalian Sumith Prasanna and we were able to win several championships at various levels. I got the opportunity to organize seven Big Matches with Sri Sumangala College, Panadura.
During this period I was promoted to the rank of Captain and transferred to Lalith Athulathmudali Vidyalaya as the Vice Principal.
Q. Did you take over cadeting in addition to your duties?
A. There was no cadeting over there at that time and I commenced and after one year. I was mobilized during the height of North East War and drafted to Matugama Youth Cadet Camp and from there I was transferred to Bulathsinhala Youth Cadet Camp as the Second in Charge and then I was promoted to the rank of Major and transferred to Bope Youth Cadet Camp at Galle as the Commanding Officer.
I encouraged most of the Cadets and students of nearby schools to join armed services and the Police and I was able to encourage more than 2000 young men to join the services and Police. In 2011 I was de mobilized and transferred to Kotalawalapura Maha Vidyalaya as the Principal.
Q. Did you continue cadeting at this school too?
A. There was no Cadeting at this school and there were about 180 girls and boys all together on the roll and classes were upto Ordinary Level. By now there were nearly 900 students and I was able to commence the Advanced Level classes.
There were no sports. I commenced Athletics and took former Vidyalian Indika Cooray as the coach and we started to do well.
We came first in the Dehiwala Division and we came fourth in the Zonal. One athlete became all island overall third in 2016.
I commenced Inter School Sports Meets and to develop athletics at school I organized an inter schools sports meet from the area schools. In Volleyball we won the Divisional title and represented at the Zonal Level.
In the sphere of education we were promoted as a one A-B School in 2015. Our school is the first Mahindodaya Vidyagara School in the island and we now have classes up to grade 13.
Q. You are at your last stages of your employment and have you got an any idea of mobilizing again?
A. Already there are several requests. But the Ministry of Education is reluctant to release me.
Q. What is the advice you can give to the students?
A. The education and extra-curricular activities of the school should go together. With my experience if you do cadeting at least for one year you will be moulded as a good citizen but every male student is not getting this opportunity as there is no cadeting at most of the schools in the island.
