Gazette notification on revising NMRA charges in Parliament today

Health Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne will present the gazette notification on revising charges of the National Medicines Regulatory Authority (NMRA) to Parliament today, a Health Ministry spokesman said.According to the spokesman, the gazette notification was released on June 14 in connection with revising the charges made for various services delivered by the NMRA. The revision has been done after nine years.
Since the NMRA is now an independent body, it should pay salaries for employees and members of expert committees.
It should also pay for the specialized services and advisory services. NMRA charges the lowest rates in South East Asia, he said.
The intention of the charge revision of registering drugs and medical equipment is to break the market monopoly maintained by multinational drug companies. Preventing unnecessary drugs coming into the country and reducing the misuse of drugs are also expected through the revision of charges. The registration fee for drug storage will be reduced by Rs. 10,000 and the registration fee for pharmacies will be reduced by Rs. 7,500 soon, once the Cabinet paper is submitted, he added.
