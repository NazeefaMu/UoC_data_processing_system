“online construction permit”

The Colombo Municipal Council on Tuesday launched its “online construction permit” platform which will facilitate the issuance of construction permits to applicants within two weeks. The applicant needs to visit the Municipal Council only twice. The applicant should appear at the CMC in person to hand over the application and he has to visit the Council again to collect the permit. Under this new system the entire process will be completed in 14 days (two weeks) from the date of handing over the documents.
