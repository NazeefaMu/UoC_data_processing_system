President agrees to remove Wijedasa Rajapakshe from office

 
President Maithripala Sirisena, this morning, agreed to removed Justice and Buddhasasana Minister Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe from office.
The decision follows a request from the United National Party (UNP) Working Committee that the Justice and Buddhasasana Minister is removed for non-compliance.
Rajapakshe was given time until August 21 to retract a statement made expressing his disagreement with the Hambantota Port agreement Sri Lanka signed with China.
The Minister had, however, not retracted his statement and had instead defended his position at a special party meeting called to discuss the matter.
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe, in his capacity as the head of the UNP, had requested President Maithripala Sirisena to remove Rajapakshe from office.
Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe is also alleged to have not moved fast enough of certain of the cases brought against the previous regime.
