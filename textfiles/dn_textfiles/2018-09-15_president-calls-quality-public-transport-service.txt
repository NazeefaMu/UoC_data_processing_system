President calls for quality public transport service

President Maithripala Sirisena said the public transportation service must be made convenient for the public.
The President was participating in a discussion at the President’s Office on maintaining a regular public transportation service and uplifting its quality.
During the discussion, progress of the Sahasara Niyamu Project introduced in 2016 was reviewed to introduce a quality transportation service.
President Sirisena brought the attention of the officers towards the ways to attract the public towards the public transportation system by reducing road congestion, ensuring their safety, and making it public-friendly service.
Transportation causes severe setbacks in economy. Crowded buses, lack of decent service, delays and other issues worsen the situation. Employers in the field will not receive professional dignity because of various public-unfriendly issues..
Sixty five per cent of the commuters used public transportation in 2008. Now the percentage has reduced to 45 per cent.
Minister Patali Champika Ranawaka, Deputy Minister Lasantha Alagiywanna, and other offers were present.
