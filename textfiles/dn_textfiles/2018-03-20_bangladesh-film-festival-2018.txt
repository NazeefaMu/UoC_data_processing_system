Bangladesh Film Festival 2018

The Bangladesh High Commission in Sri Lanka together with the National Film Corporation will hold a Bangladesh Film Festival from March 23 to 25 at the NFC film hall. Six exceptional films which have won global acclaim will be showcased at the event. Entrance free.
The cinema of Bangladesh comes from the Bengali language-based film industry, and revolves around Dhaka (Bangladesh). It has been a significant industry since the early 1970s. The industry is frequently referred to as "Dhallywood" - a portmanteau of the words Dhaka and Hollywood. The dominant style of Bangladeshi cinema is melodramatic cinema, which developed from 1947 to 1990 and characterizes most feature films to date.
Cinema was introduced in present-day Bangladesh in 1898 by Bradford Bioscope Company - credited to have arranged the first film release in Bangladesh. During 1913–‘14, the first production company i.e. Picture House was opened. A short, silent film Sukumari (The Good Girl) was the first film produced in the region (1928). Then followed the first full-length film - The Last Kiss (released in 1931). In 1956, The Face and the Mask was produced – as the first Bengali language Bangladeshi full-length feature film.
Throughout the 1960s, 70s, 80s and the first half of the 90s, the Bangladeshi film industry witnessed its golden period. Many successful films were produced. Some of the films are still adored beyond borders. Directors like Fateh Lohani, Zahir Raihan, Alamgir Kabir, Khan Ataur Rahman, Subhash Dutta, Ritwik Ghatak, Ehtesham, Chashi Nazrul Islam, Abdullah al Mamun, Sheikh Niamat Ali, Gazi Mazharul Anwar, Tanvir Mokammel, Tareque Masud, Morshedul Islam et al made significant contributions to Bangladeshi mainstream cinema, parallel cinema, art films and won global acclaim.
