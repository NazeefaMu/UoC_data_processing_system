‘Political powers to provincial councils; cornerstone to separatism’

Parliamentarian Mahinda Yapa Abeywardena said that granting political powers to provincial councils would lead to the creation of separate states in the country.
He was peaking at a press conference held in Colombo, yesterday.
Abeywardena said that former Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe has promised to the Tamil National Alliance that he would give political powers to provincial councils.
He added that the power delegated to provincial councils under the Provincial Councils Act was more than enough for a Chief Minister to carry out development work.
“Wickremesinghe has promised the abolition of Presidential powers,” Abeywardena said, “The President is the symbol of unitary status; the country cannot be divided as long as the Executive Presidency remains intact,” he said.
He added that the country was in danger as United National Party Leader Ranil Wickremesinghe wanted to divide it.
He added that he was one of the two parliamentarians who opposed the 13th Amendment to the Constitution.
“I was the chief minister of the Southern Province for seven years; I rendered an excellent service using the existing powers,” he said, “Schools and roads were developed using the council’s funds.”
