GMOA token strike on May 17

The Government Medical Officers’ Association (GMOA) has decided to launch an island wide token strike on May 17 at 8.00 am, GMOA Secretary Dr. Haritha Aluthge said.
Addressing a press conference at the GMOA Headquarters in Colombo yesterday, he said the token strike will be launched in protest of the Free Trade Agreements already signed and the Free Trade Agreements to be signed without establishing a National Policy.
“The token strike will be halted if the relevant authorities give an assurance that they will refrain from signing such agreements until the National Policy is introduced,” Dr.Aluthge said.
According to Dr. Aluthge, the GMOA had a discussion with new Higher Education Minister Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe on the SAITM issue and reached several agreements. The Minister responded positively to the demands presented by the GMOA in connection with SAITM and KDU.
Not bringing in a new Act, not offering a degree under the SAITM name, were among the topics discussed and agreed.
The GMOA expects that the agreements made during the meeting will be put into action without further delay with the consent of President Maithripala Sirisena, because any delay can pave the way for opportunists, like certain politicians and public servants who are determined to make the SAITM issue more complicated, Dr. Aluthge added.
