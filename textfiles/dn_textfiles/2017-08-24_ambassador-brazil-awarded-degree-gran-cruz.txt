Ambassador in Brazil awarded with Degree of Gran Cruz

General Jagath Jayasuriya, Sri Lankan Ambassador in Brazil was awarded with the Degree of Gran Cruz by the State Government of Goiás at a royal ceremony held on July 26. The degree and medal of honour was awarded to Ambassador Jayasuriya in recognition of the contribution he made towards strengthening trade and economic relations between Sri Lanka and the State of Goiás.
The degree which is regarded as the highest award presented by the State of Goiás is generally offered to the Brazilians who contribute to the upliftment of the economic and social wellbeing of the people of the State. Only few foreigners have so far been honoured with this award. Ambassador Jayasuriya is the first Sri Lankan Ambassador to be awarded by a Brazilian Government entity.
Presenting the award, Marconi Ferreira Perillo Junior said that the contribution made by Ambassador Jayasuriya to enhance trade and economic relations between Sri Lanka and the State of Goiás was outstanding. In order to expand existing trade and economic relations between the State of Goiás and Sri Lanka, Ambassador Jayasuriya initiated a series of trade related activities in June 2016. Since then, many promotional activities took place under his guidance and leadership.
