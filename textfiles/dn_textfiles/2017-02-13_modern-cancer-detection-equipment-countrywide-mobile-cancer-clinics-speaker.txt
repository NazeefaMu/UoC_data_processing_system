Modern cancer detection equipment for  countrywide mobile cancer clinics: Speaker

 Steps have been taken to import cancer detection equipment for mobile cancer detection clinics countrywide, Speaker Karu Jayasuriya said.
He was addressing the gathering after opening a new wards complex at the Kurundankulame cancer treatment centre in Anuradhapura on February 11.
The Speaker said cancer could be cured if it was detected in its early stages. He had personally witnessed the trauma of cancer in his own family recently and resolved to prevent others from undergoing the pain.
The Speaker commended the founder of the cancer centre Dr. Samadhi Rajapakse and his team for the great sense they rendered towards cancer patients. Mhintale Raja Maha Viharadhipathi Ven. Walawahengunawewe Dhammaratne Nayake Thera, Parliamentarian Chandima Gamage and many others were present.
