“Vibration of Strings” for music lovers

The Tower Hall Theater in Maradana is set to give a unique Hindustani classical music concert on Friday, September 15 at which legendary Indian violinist Dr. N. Rajam and her granddaughter Ragini Shankar will perform with Laknaw Gharana’s phenomenal tabla player Ustad Ilmas Hussain on one stage.
The concert, “Vibration of Strings” will commence at 6.30 pm, organized by the P. V. Nandasiri Kalakendraya (Centre of Arts). The artistes will participate in a workshop on Hindustani violin and tabla on September 16 at 9.30 am at the Indian Cultural Center, Colombo.
The Head of the Kalakendraya, Sangeet Nipun P.V. Manomanjari, the daughter of late Hindusthani classical singer and tabla player P V Nandasiri of Laknaw Gharana said they primarily organized Vibration of Strings to pay tribute to their beloved music teachers and mentors.
“We hope that this will create an unforgettable experience. This is a rare opportunity for Sri Lankan music lovers, musicians and especially music teachers to witness three of Hindustani’s best musicians,” said Manomanjari who had studied Indian music under Dr. N. Rajam.
The artistes representing various schools of Indian music and dance traditions (Gharanas) are also expected to come together at the concert. As the concert goes on with string renditions by violinist Dr. Rajam, Shankar will improvise on dynamics of Hidusthani Raagas to the scale-flows and Tabla drum bols by Ustad Ilmas Hussain. There will also be North Indian classical dance and music performances by local guest artistes at the concert. Nritya (Dance) Visharada Dumitha Gunawardena of Jaipur Gharana is to give a kathak dance performance while P. V. Upula Madushankha will play the Tabla.
The event’s script is written by Gayani Wijayasinghe. Visharada Manchana Tharushan is the organiser of the concert while Billy Fernando is on sounds.
