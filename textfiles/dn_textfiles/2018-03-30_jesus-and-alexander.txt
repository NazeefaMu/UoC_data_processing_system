Jesus and Alexander

Jesus and Alexander died at thirty-three;
One lived and died for self; one died for you and me.
The Greek died on a throne; the Jew died on a cross;
One’s life a triumphed seemed; the other but a loss.
One led vast armies forth; the other walked alone;
One shed a whole world’s blood; the other gave His own.
One won the world in life, and lost it all in death;
The other lost His life, to win the whole world’s faith.
Jesus and Alexander died at thirty-three;
One died in Babylon; and one on Calvary.
One gained all for self; and one Himself He gave;
One conquered every throne; the other every grave.
The one made himself god; our God made Himself less;
The one lived but to blast; the other but to bless!
When died the Greek, forever fell his throne of swords,
But Jesus died to live forever, Lord of lords.
Jesus and Alexander died at thirty-three;
The Greek made all men slaves; the Jew made all men free.
One built a throne on blood; the other built on love,
The one was born of earth; the other from above;
One won all this earth, to lose all earth and heaven.
The other gave up all, that all to Him be given.
The Greek forever died; the Jew forever lives;
He loses all who gets, and wins all things who gives!
