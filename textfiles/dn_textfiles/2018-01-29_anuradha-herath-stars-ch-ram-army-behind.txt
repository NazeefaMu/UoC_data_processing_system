Anuradha Herath stars as CH ram Army from behind

A spectacular last minute try scored by former Peterite ruggerite cum CH winger Anuradha Herath off a superb off load by inspirational ex-Sri Lanka captain Yoshitha Rajapaksa and a stunning touch line conversion slotted in by St. Anthony’s College Kandy star player Samuel Maduwantha seconds before the final whistle saw CH&FC come from behind to pull off a stunning 30-28 win over Army SC in their Dialog 'A' division inter-club league rugby second round match played at Havelock Park yesterday
CH scored their 30 points through 4 tries, 2 conversions and 2 penalties to Army’s 28 that came off 4 tries, 1 conversion and 2 penalties. At half time CH trailed Army 15-17.
CH showed better control of the ball in perfect conditions and turned the match in their favour with a rousing game carried out in the second half.
CH were always sure of what to do, in contrast to the Army who only knew to run straight often into their opposite number and thereby lost the grip on the game and any hopes of winning due to the game they carried throughout the entire second half.
However the Army outfit staged a spirited performance in the first half by scoring three quick tries to lead the game and go into the breather with a two point lead.
But CH gave a superb brand of running rugby in the second half under the instructions of their head coach Tavita Thulagaese "Laga" where they enjoyed major share of possession from the scrums, line outs, set pieces and the break downs by putting up a sensational effort to topple Army and dared to run the ball and gain territory whenever a gap in the opponents defence was detected.
CH sealed the game by scoring a total of four tries through flanker Yoshitha Rajapaksa (one), crack centre Lee Keegal (one), flanker Kanchana Lakshitha (one) and Anuradha Herath (one). Fly half Samuel Maduwantha put over the two conversions and the two penalties.
Prop forward Nanayakkara, wing three quarters Bandara and Sudaraka Dikkumbura along with fly half Ashan Bandara scored one try apiece for Army. The solitary conversion and the two penalties were slotted in by their full back Gayan Salinda.
Referee Charlie Brown from Singapore had an excellent game with the whistle.
