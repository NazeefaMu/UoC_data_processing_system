Amãna Bank wins IFN Best Bank accolade

Amãna Bank was adjudged IFN’s Best Islamic Bank in Sri Lanka for the 6th consecutive year, based on a global poll conducted in 2016 by the Malaysia-based RedMoney Group.
The IFN Awards poll recognizes the best providers of Islamic financial services across the global markets which also include the World’s Best Islamic Bank, the Best Islamic Bank by Country, the Best Central Bank and the Best Islamic Banking Deals for the Year.
The IFN polls takes an unbiased and all-encompassing approach in selecting the best banks in the world. Since its establishment in 2005, it continues to be the appropriate representation of the current Islamic financial market landscape and is the industry’s most comprehensive annual poll.
Amãna Bank’s Chairman Osman Kassim, who was in Kuala Lumpur recently to participate at the IFN Asian Forum as panelist to discuss on the opportunities for Islamic Finance and Investments in Sri Lanka, collected the award from RedMoney Group Managing Director and Publisher Andrew Morgan.
Sharing his views Kassim said “We are honored to have been bestowed the title of Best Islamic Bank in Sri Lanka, which testifies our market leadership as well as the impact we have had on growing the non-interest based banking model in the country. I am truly grateful to the CEO and staff of Amãna Bank for their commitment, passion and leadership in taking the Bank forward as we continue our inclusive expansion strategy reaching out to all Sri Lankans, in line with the our five-year strategic plan.”
