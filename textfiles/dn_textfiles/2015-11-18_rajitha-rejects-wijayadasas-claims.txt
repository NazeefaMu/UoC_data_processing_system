Rajitha rejects Wijayadasa's claims

Health Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne had rejected claims made by Justice Minister Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe in connection with a judgement given by courts convicting Dr. Senaratne for importing low quality drugs to Sri Lanka, Media Secretary to the Health Minister Nipun Ekanayake said.
According to Ekanayake, Minister Rajapakshe was recently reported to have said that Dr.Senaratne had been convicted by the judiciary for importing low quality drugs to Sri Lanka. But, Dr. Senaratne rejected it. No such judgement had been given by the courts. Judge Mahanama Thilakaratne had stated that the case had been a fabricated one. The 400 page judgement acquitted Dr.Senaratne from all charges.
Dr. Senaratne had not supplied medical equipment and the case had been filed against him because he had criticized the Government while being an opposition MP.
"The medical equipment imported under an agreement between the Government and the relevant companies. The case was filed just before the court vacation and Minister Rajapaksa had obtained money for representing Government for the case," he said.
