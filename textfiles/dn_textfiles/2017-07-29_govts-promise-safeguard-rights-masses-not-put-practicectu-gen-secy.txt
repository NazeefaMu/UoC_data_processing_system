Govt.'s promise to safeguard rights of masses not put into practice:CTU Gen. Secy.

The general public voted for the establishment of the ‘Yahapalanaya’ regime to end corruption and safeguard the rights of the people, but not to create a regime similar to the previous regime, said the Ceylon Teachers’ Union General Secretary Joseph Stalin.
He was speaking at a media briefing at the Ceylon Mercantile Union (CMU) Hall yesterday, along with several other trade unions to voice against the attack on Petroleum Trade Union members.
Stalin said the Government had come into power with the promise to safeguard the rights of the general public, yet it had not been put into practice. He also said, “A country should have sustainable economic policies. Although it does not necessarily imply that a government should prioritise economic objectives of the country over the needs of the general public. Therefore, the leaders of the country have to pay attention to the concerns and demands of the public, prior to the implementation of plans to achieve economic growth.”
The General Secretary further alleged that the attack on Petroleum Trade Union members was conducted by the Government.
CMU General Secretary Sylvester Jayakody said that petroleum trade union action had been conducted to protect the resources of the country and not with the aim of satisfying narrow needs such as demanding for higher wages.
Jayakody also stated that continuous trade union action would be conducted islandwide if no equitable solutions be provided immediately by the Government to the prevailing issues related to the petroleum strike.
Delegates from the Ceylon Bank Employees Union, Ceylon Plantation Workers’ Union, United Workers’ Union, Government Press Employees’ Union and Insurance Employees’ Union also participated.
