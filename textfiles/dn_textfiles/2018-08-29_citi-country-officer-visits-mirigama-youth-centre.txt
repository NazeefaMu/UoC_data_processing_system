Citi Country Officer visits Mirigama Youth Centre

Country Officer of Citi Sri Lanka, Ravin Basnayake visited the National Youth Services Council Youth Centre in Mirigama recently to conduct the session on ‘financial literacy’ under the ‘Technopreneurship for Social Change’ programme.
The session highlights the importance of making informed decisions on financial resources for budding entrepreneurs. The United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) in Sri Lanka has partnered with the National Youth Services Council (NYSC), Citi and Cisco to conduct e-learning programmes in 20 locations across Sri Lanka to build on national priorities placed on strengthening the knowledge on Information and Communication Technology skills and to equip youth with the right tools to contribute to the sustainable development of the country.
This innovative mode of learning will also support in developing the entrepreneurial skills of youth, thus providing them with the ability to positively contribute towards the economy.
The two-day workshop which engages 50 participants at each youth centre, is part of a wider programme which will engage approximately 1000 youth through the NYSC network island wide, who will have an opportunity to study the Cisco eLearning course on entrepreneurship supported by Citi.
Speaking at the session, Basnayake said, “Technology to us is the fourth revolution in the world, and we believe that it has the capacity to uplift the lives of people in a way that no other movement is able to. By empowering people to reach markets and access technologies, we can build entrepreneurship skills among the youth of the country”.
At present, the programme has been successfully completed in four locations- Dehiwala, Chilaw, Elpitiya and Mirigama.
