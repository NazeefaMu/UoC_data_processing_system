Navy erects solar-powered electric fence in Sooriyawewa

A solar powered electric fence devised by the Sri Lanka Navy was erected in Sooriyawewa on May 9.
Commander of the Navy, Vice Admiral Ravindra Wijegunaratne initiated the project. It was implemented by the Navy's Research and Development Unit under Captain Priyankara Dissanayake.
It is another grand community development and social responsibility project carried out by the Navy to resolve the issues of the general public.
Taking the elephant menace prevailing in the area into serious consideration, the Navy’s Research and Development Unit devised the cost effective electric fence using their expertise and technical know-how.
The 4 km-long electric fence will protect the villagers and their properties from the wild elephants.
