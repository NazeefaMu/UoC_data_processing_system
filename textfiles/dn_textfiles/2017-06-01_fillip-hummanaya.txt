Fillip for Hummanaya

The blowhole also known as Hummanaya in Tangalle will be developed on the initiative of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources State Minister Dillip Vedaarachchi.
A committee headed by the Tangalle Divisional Secretary has been formed to expedite the development work.
A yacht anchoring area will be set up close to the Tangalle fisheries harbour parallel to the blow hole development, the state minister said.
