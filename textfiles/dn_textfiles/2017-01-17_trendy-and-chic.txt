Trendy and chic!

The Kingsbury high tea monthly fashion show featuring an impressive collection by the young designer Anouki Cooke was held on December 7 at The Gourmet Station. The collection featured some stunning designs from her label 'Anouki' just in for the festive season. The event received a good turn out as the high tea buffet at The Kingsbury delivered great flavours and variety.
