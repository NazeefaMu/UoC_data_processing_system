Mixed views on Good Governance : 2017, the year of Judgement!

It has been two years since Sri Lanka came under the 'A Compassionate Maithri Governance - A Stable Country.' Here some well-known personalities who have been a part of the driving force behind the change share their views about the present government with the Daily News.
Somaratne Dissanayake
People elect a new leadership and government expecting a change. The past two years have seen some positive changes taking place in the country. The issue of bribery and corruption is almost under control. They are investigating cases which have been done and have been ignored in the past.
The country's economy is in a positive state. Some of the general problems of the people too have been solved. Their day to day living conditions have improved.
We have to appreciate these changes. However there have been no changes in the arts field yet. The situation is the same or even worse. Since the authorities have turned a blind eye on the problems in the arts sector, issues have doubled. We expected more but got nothing in return so far.
They have not met our expectations yet. We need remedies for these issues which hinder our work. In my point of view the year 2017 is the 'Year of Judgment'. Two years is more than enough for a new government to settle in and recognize the problems in each sector. They cannot give excuses after this term. They need to start working instead of talking now.
Dilhani Asokamala
We worked towards establishing this government expecting some change. I am on alert, just waiting to see what is happening.
Dharmasiri Bandaranayake
The main reason why the public wanted a change is because they wanted to live a life free of fear and suspicions. The country was under the rulership of a dictator then. People did not have the freedom to express their opinions.
They were not in a state to seek the law to solve their problems. It was like we were all controlled by a certain force.
The present government too seems to be forgetting that it is the people who put them in power. It can be seen by their haughty behaviour. They do not have any knowledge about the results of the wrong decisions that they take.
The law gone astray, a society living in fear, corruption and nepotism... You can forget such incidents if they happened many years back but can you ignore them if they happened in recent times? A parent can't even admit their child into a school of their preference in peace because certain personalities work against it by establishing societies under various names. This is the pathetic but true state of affairs.

I sense that we are in better hands if you compare the present government with the previous one. They have taken the needs of the citizens to heart. The law and order of the country has been reformed.
There are no partialities like before. However there is much more to be done. We need to move towards a better direction.
Though I am happy about these changes what concerns me now is that most of the decision makers in the government were the same ones who held top positions in the previous government as well. This is not what we expected from them. I am waiting to see what would happen next.
Suresh Maliyadde
We had great hopes that something would happen after the elections are over. Now two years after obtaining power the government still hasn't made the changes we expected from them. Now bitter experiences have made me come to the conclusion that no matter who would come to power, they will not build up- this country.
Navaratne Gamage
Peace among ethnic groups and the citizens of the country is the most important factor at the moment. It is the government's duty towards the people to take up this matter seriously. We got details about many murders due to the greed for power in the past. Even the poor people in the country need to transform their life in a certain manner.
I was in Cambodia recently. I witnessed that the situation in that country is similar to that which our country had in the 1970s. Though we have gathered many material goods today but our human qualities have deteriorated. The barbaric nature of the society has increased today.
We need to guide the new generation towards the correct path. They are keen to pursue knowledge but cannot do so because of the division of power. There are too many philosophers today. The whole country is in an uproar. We need to look at matters with a critical eye.
We have lost many opportunities to make quality productions. An artiste is dedicated to his or her work. Unlike other fields the arts helps to reform the lifestyle of the people.
Samanalee Fonseka
We were disappointed with certain things done by the previous government. The turning point came with the Aluthgama anti-Muslim riots. We feared that another Black July was about to dawn. So we decided to act and support the opposition.
That was not the best decision to take but it was an option. We can see a slight improvement in the relationships between ethnic groups today which has broken away from former president Mahinda Rajapaksa's nationalistic vision. We need to change the mindset of the people in the south so that they will not fear or hate the Tamil people anymore. This is a very important initiative but the government has brushed it aside. As members of the Aluth Parapura Kalakaruwo society, we are doing what we can but the Government needs to play a bigger role in this matter.
Parakrama Niriella
The government has taken up matters like peace and law seriously but they have not done anything on behalf of the arts. We decided to support them after getting a signed document from President Maithripala Sirisena before the 2015 presidential elections stating that he would make certain changes in the field once he comes into power but today both the President and the Prime Minister are too busy to give even a date and time for discussions. They are too concerned about their own businesses to look into the issues in the arts field.
