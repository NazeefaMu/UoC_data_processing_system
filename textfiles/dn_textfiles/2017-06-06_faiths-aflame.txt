Faiths aflame

For most people, following a religion means belonging to a religious denomination and following a system of beliefs, expressing it in certain practices of worship in private and / or in public devotion, celebrating holy days and adopting certain attitudes of life and striving to relate to oneself and others in ways consistent with one’s beliefs. Although we are supposed to be living in a Dharmadveepa an island of righteousness, we are not a sufficiently spiritual people as a whole.
There is so much of crime and corruption, vice, cruelty and wickedness, dishonesty, deception and thieving, bullying and ragging, unkindness, rampant harassment and unlawfulness, indifference and unconcern for the helplessness and the sufferings of the poor. Professing to be religiously devoted men and women, some have unjustly used their office to do manifest wrong while others have swindled the Country and exploited her for self-gain.
There are many who frequent temples and participate in religious observances and yet engage in superstitious practices, usurp and abuse their official positions, careless of the duty of doing an honest job and are indifferent to social obligations, evading even the payment of taxes.
Yet other people who do not regularly participate in worshipful rites and celebrations in temples nevertheless live righteously and act according to their honest convictions.
Karl Marx, looking at all reality from the tinted glass of economics and class struggle, thought of religion, of his time naturally as observed by him, as an opium that drugged especially the poor people of an unjust, wicked and merciless commercialized capitalist world order that led them into an unreal and imaginary world of hope in a heaven beyond, that may never exist.
Even though a free, fraternal, just an honest society has not come about even in the socialist world, following Marx – in fact, atrocious crimes against humanity have been perpetrated in communist countries – many have dismissed religion as of no benefit to mankind; thought of God has been interpreted as a creation of the human mind, even though some would defend the rights of man to adopt and follow a religion of one’s choice. People could have various attitudes to religion.
FROM HUMAN EXPERIENCE
Religions arose among human beings. There is a constituent element in all human beings that searches and yearns to find, embrace, acquire and possess spiritual values. Some values seem beyond man yet not beyond his reach. This search is not a search for physical goods and possessions of material value that could be measured in terms of silver and gold. It is a spiritual pursuit towards possessing a value, a basic and fundamental truth about life attained and found through spiritual search, human effort and insight and living one’s life according to what one has found. Of course, selfishness and love of pleasure and indifference to principles and values of life do make a human being a hard-core prodigal.
Religions originated through the experiences of human beings. Some remarkable individuals experienced an enlightenment, a revelation hidden from the ordinary mass of human beings. And devoting themselves to that quest and imparting that learning of theirs to others they brought fellow human beings to a deeper, more abundant and meaningful level of human living. They who devoted themselves to the search for deep human and spiritual values of life shared their experiences with those who were closest to them who also likewise experienced and embraced the truth of the one who experienced it first.
It is necessary for all followers of a religion to examine the veracity and the substance of that original experience. If the experience of the original encounters is valid and authentic, then the followers too could have a similar experience because it is a human experience and a human understanding of it. They could then further test the truth of that unique primordial experience and come to a similar spiritual experience themselves.
Of course before basing oneself on such a truth also means investigating the validity, the authenticity and the reliability of the unique spiritual experience of the Teacher whose life does not show evident contradictions, evils or sin. An all-embracing and life-transforming experience of deep spiritual richness is experienced by those whose spirits could comprehend and absorb it and perceive its consistency to the truths of life as they know it. Reason leads one to distinguish between deluding imagination, misjudgement, misunderstanding, and credulous devotion leading to the misinterpretation of experiences, ambiguity in the communication of experiences and a perception of the clarity of truth from falsehood evidenced in the life. Also, the authenticity of the experiences of the first followers of such a leader and the truth, the validity and faithfulness of the communications transmitted by the followers of such a leader needs to be investigated.
RELIGIOUS TRADITION RELIABLE?
A problem may arise because the religious leaders themselves did not leave a testament of theirs in a script of their own. What we have are testimonies of their closest followers, put down in writing. The written scriptures came as a result of an oral tradition. The oral tradition that developed with understanding and interpretation and preaching of the message was documented after a period of time.
The investigation should focus on ‘How close was the relationship of the followers to the author of the proclamation. How faithfully has the oral proclamation been recorded without distorting it and how capable, competent and authoritative were they to do it. How realistically have the messages been transcribed needs to be judged by objectively and critically investigating the documentation and the manner and style of the documentation by the followers who recorded them and by establishing the authenticity of what has been documented and later copied innumerable times. And how reliable are the copies that record the religious tradition that has come down to us? Once this has been established, one begins to have faith in what has been recorded and handed down.
EVALUATE THE SCRIPTURES
All religious scriptures should undergo this critical examination and evaluation just as archaeological artefacts, historical documents and religious relics should undergo verification and establishment of authenticity.
What should we expect to find in the testimony of the closest followers of the Teachers? We should find an authentic record of what they experienced, knew, taught and shared. We should find the Teacher’s life to be a living epitome, a personification of his message.
There is something that transcends our individual selves that pervade humanity. This is evident when we go beyond ourselves to gratuitously serve others, especially when they need our help. It is up to each one of us to decipher whether it is a spiritual thirst that seeks satisfaction or whether there is a religious spirit pervading humanity. Even a person without a religion could have a spirituality, an acceptable attitude to life and its challenges; there cannot exist a religious person without a spirituality.
RELIGIONS SPIRITUALLY ENRICHING?
Therefore the question can be asked whether our people understand well the religions they follow and whether they live according to what they understand and believe? What is the spirituality in the religions they follow? Is it a spirituality that is self-centred or a spirituality that is self-donating in service to others that spiritually enriches all?
Human beings are influenced for the better or worse by other human beings. Some leading persons among religious leaders and politicians depending on the quality of their lives exercise a certain influence over others. When leading persons themselves are spiritually flawed and act in contravention of religious principles, they cause great harm to society.
Politicians in power though they like to show themselves as devoted to religion and benevolent to the followers of all religions, do not, in fact, act truthfully, honestly, justly, fairly and impartially in the crucial instances where truth, justice and good social order are at stake. They show themselves spineless and practically untrue to their own religion.
While even people of no religion urge the authorities to act determinedly to uphold law and order extending equality and justice towards all, the supposed to be followers of religious teachings show themselves to be weak and vacillating, not at all strengthened and emboldened by their religious principles. They do not show themselves to be deeply convinced or rooted on their religious principles.
Among the politicians following various religions are skimmers of ‘commissions’, bribe takers, drug traffickers, dishonest men and women who abuse their offices and their positions, money launderers, manipulators of people and law breakers. This shows that religion does not touch the interior core of their person leading them to act justly, truthfully, honestly and religiously. The pretence of being religious is a convenient and conventional political cover. If religion is vibrant among the prominent people, there cannot be room for hatred for minorities and anarchism. It is necessary for all to be honest about their religious affiliation and live truthfully and honestly according to the norms of their religion.
