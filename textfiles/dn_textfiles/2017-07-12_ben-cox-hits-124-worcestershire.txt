Ben Cox hits 124 for Worcestershire

LONDON, Monday: A career-best 124 from wicketkeeper Ben Cox
helped Worcestershire recover from a precarious position on day two against Gloucestershire in their English county championship match.
The visitors had slumped to 69-4 in reply to Gloucestershire's 383 all out at Cheltenham, before Cox and George Rhodes (52) shared a stand of 141.
Cox eventually nicked medium-pacer Kieran Noema-Barnett (4-31) behind and Worcestershire declared on 300-9.
The hosts batted out eight overs to close on 20-0, leading by 103.
