Alleged unlawful acquisition of money and assets:
Case against Wimal fixed for August 6

A corruption case filed against former minister and National Freedom Front (NFF) leader Wimal Weerawansa was yesterday fixed for August 6 by the Colombo High Court.
High Court Judge Vikum Kaluarachchi made this order regarding an indictment filed against Wimal Weerawansa for the alleged unlawful acquisition of money and assets, estimated at Rs.75 million, within a period of six years, while serving as a minister, during the former regime.
President’s Counsel Jayantha Weerasinghe, appearing for the accused, sought a further date to present their stance regarding the computer evidence of the case. This case is to be taken up on the next date as a calling date.
The Director General of the Commission to Investigate Allegations of Bribery or Corruption alleged that the former minister had committed this offence by way of undeclared assets between January 1, 2009, and December 31, 2014.
The indictments were filed under 39 incidents based on monetary and property transactions estimated at Rs.75 million.
The Director General alleged that the former minister had unlawfully made 26 monetary transactions, constructed a house, and purchased lands and vehicles in contravention of Section 23(a) of the Bribery Act.
The Director General further alleged that former minister Weerawansa had owned these properties, deemed under the provision of the Act to be property acquired through bribery.
