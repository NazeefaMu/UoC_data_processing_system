SLFP is not anyone’s fiefdom: Thalatha

 
The SLFP is not the fiefdom of anyone, said Foreign Employment Minister Thalatha Athukorala. The minister, speaking at a UNP promotional programme in Kalawana, said former President Mahinda Rajapaksa thought that he could remain in power for more years. His son Namal Rajapaksa becomes President after him at whatever cost, she said. She said the Bandaranaike dynasty lasted for 50 years. The former President also thought that his family could rule for 50 years.
“However, when the son of a farmer family from rural Polonnaruwa became President, it is hateful to them. They though it did not matter even if people perish as long as members of the Rajapaksa family become Presidents. Since there is no sign that the Rajapaksa family can come into the power, they try to block the path of President Maithripala Sirisena,” he said.
