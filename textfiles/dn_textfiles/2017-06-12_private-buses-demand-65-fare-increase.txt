Private buses demand 6.5% fare increase

Lanka Private Bus Owner’s Association (LPBOA) yesterday demanded a 6.5 percent increase of private bus fare according to the annual bus fare revision.
Addressing a media briefing held in Colombo yesterday, (LPBOA) President Gemunu Wijeratne said private bus fares should be increased by July 1 due to the unchanged prices of fuel, overhead costs for service and repair, salaries of the crew, tyres and tubes and other maintenance.
The annual bus fare revision would take place every year in July and bus fares are revised based on a special formula taking into account various factors such as the rate of inflation, the price of a litre of diesel, electricity charges, maintenance costs and the price of tyres and other spare parts, he added.
“We are waiting for the National Transport Commissions decision on fare increase which is yet to be reached,” he added.
