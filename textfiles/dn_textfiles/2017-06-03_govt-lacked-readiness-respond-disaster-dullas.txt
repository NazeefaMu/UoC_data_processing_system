Govt lacked readiness to respond to disaster -Dullas

The Government again showcased its inability and lack of readiness to respond to a national disaster, United People’s Freedom Alliance (UPFA) MP Dullas Alahapperuma said.
Speaking to the Daily News he said that past two years could be pointed out as the years with the most hazards reported in the country.
Alahapperuma said the country's leaders should find out the causes for this incident and should take the sole responsibility for this disaster.
He said the Government had been unable to provide relief to the victims of the previous disasters and that had seriously affected to the trust of the victims towards the Government.
MP further said the elderly population and children had been most prone to the recent floods and landslides.
Alahapperuma said that the Government was only capable of providing relief to the affected but had neglected to give attention to the disaster management aspects.
