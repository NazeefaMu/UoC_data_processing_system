‘Terrorists would not come under Reparations Act’s purview’

The Reparations Act has been brought to pay compensation in respect of truly disappeared persons and those who suffered damage on account of war and other turmoil, Megapolis and Western Development Minister Patali Champika Ranawaka said.
"This is different to the way Rajapaksa paid salaries and compensation to terrorist leaders such as KP, Ram and Nagulan, who massacred innocent civilians in their hundreds," he said.
Minister Ranawaka was addressing a meeting after laying the foundation stone for the proposed new trade complex building at Kolonnawa, recently.
The minister said an office for paying reparations has been established to which the President would appoint officials to pay reparations to people who have undergone suffering on account of the war and gone missing.
"The Office for Missing Persons would nominate people who had truly gone missing. Thereafter, it would investigate the accuracy of the claimant and see whether he or she had truly disappeared or is living abroad before paying compensation," the minister said.
"Earlier, compensation was granted according to an archaic law enacted in 1987 and the payment was carried out by Divisional Secretaries. It was to streamline this process and offer proper guidelines, that the Reparations Act was enacted," he added.
Minister Ranawaka said nearly 12,600 LTTE terrorists surrendered to the Security Forces during the last stages of the war.
"Of them, LTTE leaders such as KP, Ram and Nagulan were even paid salaries by Rajapaksa. They were people responsible for the massacre of hundreds of innocent civilians in Moneragala, Kataragama and elsewhere. Another group of nearly 1,000 terrorists were deployed for Army intelligence services and paid monthly salaries by Rajapaksa. When they questioned about these payments, the answer given was that they would ensure a vote bank for the Rajapaksa regime from the Vanni and the Eastern Province at the next election," Minister Ranwaka alleged.
Minister Ranawaka said he would challenge Rajapaksa to come forward and deny that they paid salaries and compensation to surrendered LTTE terrorist cadres through Army intelligence services.
Minister Ranawaka said the government would bring in a new Counter Terrorism Act to replace the PTA. Once the Supreme Court opinion was received for it by the Speaker, it would be brought before Parliament. It was the people who were not even seen during the final do-or-die battle against terrorists who now try to pose as national heroes on Facebook.
"Terrorism would come under the old PTA. Terrorists would not come under the purview of the Reparations Act. A lot of false rumours were being spread in the country. The government displayed a weakness by not countering them. People in the North and South should resolve to join hands and march forward without getting misled by false rumours spread by those forces with vested interests and ulterior motives," the minister said.
