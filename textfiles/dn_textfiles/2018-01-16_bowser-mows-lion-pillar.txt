Bowser mows into Lion Pillar

The 37-year-old Lion Pillar at the Mihintale New Town junction roundabout and accompanying edifices were completely damaged when an fuel bowser coming from the direction of the Matale junction crashed into it in the wee hours yesterday.
Mihintale police investigating the incident said they suspected the driver dozed off due to fatigue and lost control of the vehicle resulting in the accident.
The driver and his assistant were unhurt. The bowser was on its way to Trincomalee to obtain fresh supplies when the accident occurred.
Although the driver was not arrested, legal action would be taken against him for damaging state property, police said.
