SC decision eagerly awaited

A cross section of political leaders and lawyers interviewed by the Daily News said they were eagerly awaiting the Supreme Court’s verdict on the dissolution of Parliament. Representatives of all parties said they would abide by the Court’s decision. Most expressed the opinion that people have now been given an opportunity to elect a Government of their choice on January 5. Excerpts from the interviews:
JNP leader, Minister Wimal Weerawansa:
Sri Lanka has the only party in the world which goes to Court against elections. We are seeking a mandate to chase away the bank robbers, to stop the persecution of war heroes and end the shady oil price formula. It is a pity that our opposition parties have stooped to this low level.
SLFP General Secretary Rohana Lakshman Piyadasa:
The President has an option to seek the people’s verdict in a crisis. Holding an election is one such method. The President has taken that decision, but if some think it is not a good decision, they are free to seek the Court’s opinion. And going to Court is a much better option than resorting to violence. The people must reign supreme in all our endeavours.
Pivithuru Hela Urumaya leader Minister Udaya Gammanpila:
The UNP suffers from people phobia and have been postponing elections for the last four years. However, now the President has given an opportunity for the people to elect their representatives. The power lies with the people. An election is the best feature of a democracy.
Today, many have filed petitions in the Supreme Court against the holding of an election. This is the first time in the world that political parties have gone to Court against an election. This is a matter of shame for the UNP. However, we are happy that the UNP has finally gone to Court instead of taking their case to foreign ambassadors.
SLPP General Secretary Sagara Kariyawasam:
The President’s decision is Constitutional. He has taken this decision in terms of the powers vested in him by the Constitution. However we have no issue with parties and individuals going to Court on this issue. Our stance is that the President acted legally within his rights.
LSSP General Secretary Prof Tissa Vitarana:
We are happy that the UNP is seeking the Court’s opinion instead of going to foreign embassies. We should find solutions to our problems without foreign intervention.
An election is an opportunity to express the people’s will and supremacy. The President took every action within the confines of the Constitution. He has the right and the power to dissolve and prorogate Parliament. However, the Supreme Court will provide an interpretation. We should all abide by that ruling. We thank the President for calling an election which is a good chance for the people to elect a Government of their choice.
Senior lawyer Gomin Dayasri:
The President has taken a decision to dissolve Parliament and we are awaiting the Court’s decision. All parties expect to hear the opinion of the masses. The people now expect a General Election. We are seeking a verdict that both sides can accept.
JVP Propaganda Secretary Vijitha Herath:
The Fundamental Rights of the six Parliamentarians from our party have been violated by the President’s decision to dissolve Parliament. This is why we instituted legal action.
UNP General Secretary Akila Viraj Kariyawasam:
We have faith in the Judiciary and the Courts. We are ready to accept the verdict given by the Supreme Court.
