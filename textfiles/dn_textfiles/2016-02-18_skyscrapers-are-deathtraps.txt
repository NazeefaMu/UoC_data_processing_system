SKYSCRAPERS ARE DEATHTRAPS ?

It’s never just a fire, if it’s in a skyscraper, is it? It has to be “an inferno”. Events are always more dramatic when they occur on the 60th floor. And as flames “engulfed” the 63-storey 5-star Address Downtown Hotel in Dubai this New Year’s Eve, our worst fears about tall buildings were fuelled once again. Skyscrapers may represent the height of luxury and provide astonishing views, but they’re death traps all the same.
Except that they’re not, actually. Not anymore. With each inferno, earthquake and terrorist attack over the last half century, each new landmark architectural brief, building technology has got better and better. Though comparisons to 70s disaster movies are inevitable, high rise no longer needs to be seen as (to quote Paul Newman) “a shrine to all the bull---- in the world”, because design has come to the rescue.
Today’s tall buildings are no longer just silhouettes on the skyline – they have potential far beyond their panoramic views. Which is good, because with increasing urbanisation, and the rise of the megacity, many of us will likely end up living in one.
When it comes to skyscraper design disaster has been the father of invention. It’s thanks to horrific earthquakes in Japan and San Francisco that in any quake today, the 25th floor of a modern skyscraper is one of the safest places to be. While the building sways rather than collapses, you will be kept safe from falling debris and stampedes of panicking people in the street.
Since 9/11 architects and engineers have worked harder than ever to improve fire safety and evacuation possibilities. Where one of the problems in tall buildings has traditionally been access for firefighters, whose hoses will generally only reach 50ft (a high-rise building is defined as anything from 75ft upwards), this is now a major consideration in any new build.
The new Freedom Tower, on the site just north of the Twin Towers, features a dedicated staircase for emergency crews. Pressurised and protected by 3ft concrete walls, it runs through the very core of the building, ensuring firefighters have access enough to tackle the flames in good time.
Dubai, home to more than 900 skyscrapers, as well as the world’s tallest (the 168-storey Burj Khalifa) is also doing its bit to advance the high rise safety cause. The Burj in particular has benefited from post 9/11 innovations with designated “refuge areas” on each floor where occupants gather in case of fire before taking safe lifts (named “lifeboats”) down to the ground floor, and the exits.
Despite the ‘towering inferno’ in Dubai, there has been a design revolution in high-rise buildings
Later this year too, Dubai is set to introduce a new level of futuristic fire fighting, with flying forces, specially trained and equipped with jetpacks. Designed by New Zealand manufacturer Martin Aircraft Company, the jetpacks not only shoot rescue missions straight to the relevant balcony from outside, but will also manoeuvre heavy equipment and assess heat sources using thermal imaging cameras.
Of course the bad press that skyscrapers encounter is not all misplaced. Greedy developers with a “pile ’em high, sell ’em at a premium” mentality can be identified through any number of empty and odd-looking trophy towers creeping up on the world’s ever-busier city skylines.
But there is good news here too as tall buildings begin to address new problems. Climate change and housing shortages are very real issues that towers can realistically be expected to address – and in the face of them, skyscrapers in the 21st century are beginning to look very different from their predecessors.
Architectural ego wars and overly gilded towers playing top Trumps on the skyline appear both dated and a little pathetic in the face of these innovations and ideas – buildings like CF Møller’s “woodscraper” design for Stockholm, a 34-storey apartment block made from timber.
Wood is taking over from steel and concrete as the architectural wonder material, with cross laminated timber (CLT) in particular being increasingly popular with architects for its sustainability, quality and speed of construction – as well as its safety credentials. (Specially developed coatings combined with proper building regulations can make a wooden apartment building 50 times more fire safe than a similar apartment building made of concrete.)
Or what about a vertical SkyFarm – a proposal by Rogers Stirk Harbour + Partners developed in response to the 2015 Milan Expo theme “feed the world”? An alternative to the typical land-intensive farming systems, it is designed to produce crops in multistorey structures within high-density urban areas or where there is insufficient land or poor quality soil.
Even more progressive (or outlandish) still, Dutch architects DoepelStrijkers have designed a huge circular wind turbine that doubles as an apartment block, hotel and… a rollercoaster.
The Dutch WindWheel is designed to generate more energy than it uses, while also attracting around 1.5 million visitors per year.
Whether it ever gets built we’ll have to see, but when it comes to high-octane architectural drama we’ve come a long way from infernos. (telegraph.co.uk)
