Ja-Ela UC endorses appointment of Mahinda Rajapaksa as Premier

Ja-Ela Urban Council Chairman Shammika Dias (SLPP) moved a motion endorsing the appointment of Mahinda Rajapaksa as the new Prime Minister at the monthly meeting of the UC November 9.
Councillor Anne Deepika Marcus (SLPP) supporting the motion said previous government did not develop the country. She said Mahinda Rajapaksa was appointed as the Prime Minister by the President to revive the stalled development.
Councillor Sumedha Rukmal (SLPP) said Mahinda Rajapaksa is full of experience and he is the most suitable person to develop the country.
Councillor Anton Nishantha (JVP) said the new appointment has created political chaos in the country.
Chairman Dias cut him short and said the JVP is known for murders and chaos.
“You are a dictator. You cannot order me to shut-up. I am speaking on the motion, Nishantha said.
Earnest Fernando (UNP) said the appointment is shameful and they buy parliamentarians for money.
Susantha Perera (UNP) said President Sirisena has done unconstitutional things. The President is ungrateful. He betrayed the country and gave it to a set of people who behave like wild animals, he said.
When the Chairman brought a motion to meet the members’ expenses on telephone bills by increasing present payment Rs 2,500 to Rs 5,000 and travelling expenses from Rs 2,500 to Rs 5,000, Councillor Stefny Fernando (JVP) said he does not want anything above his salary. “Remember we were voted to serve people,” he said.
Counsillor Susantha Perera (UNP) opposed the motion. “I do not accept any other payment other than my salary.
We were voted to serve the people, not to live with the people’s money to fatten our bellies,” he said.
