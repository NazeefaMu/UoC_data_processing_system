Sarath Kumara Gunaratne  further remanded

 Former Deputy Minister Sarath Kumara Gunaratne arrested for allegedly misappropriating Rs.12 million of public funds allocated for the Negombo Lagoon Development Project, was yesterday ordered to be further remanded till January 13 by Colombo Chief Magistrate Lal Bandara.
The former Fisheries Deputy Minister was arrested by the CID on December 2 for the alleged misappropriation of Rs. 12 million belonging to the Ceylon Fisheries Harbour Corporation (CFHC) during the last Presidential election.
Rejecting a bail application submitted on behalf of the former minister on medical grounds, the Chief Magistrate observed that the medical reports submitted in Court were unreadable and unable to understand and the defence was directed to submit fresh medical reports in due course.
Defence Counsel Sampath Mendis appearing for the suspect, had earlier informed Court that there is no summary of evidence against the suspect alleging that he had committed anything wrong and moved Court that his client be released on bail as he is suffering from diabetes.
On a previous occasion, CFHC former Chairman Upali Liyanage, CFHC General Manager Piyal Abeysekara, Deputy General Manager Chandana Palpita and Lakmuni Munidasa were ordered to be released on bail regarding this incident. In this case, the CID had named six individuals including Gunaratne as the suspects following the instructions of the Attorney General. The Special Presidential Investigation Commission had recommended that the Attorney General’s advise be sought to institute legal action against persons responsible for the alleged financial frauds.
The Attorney General is expected to file indictments against the suspects in the High Court.
