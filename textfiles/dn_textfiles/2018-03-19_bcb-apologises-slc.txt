BCB apologises to SLC

The Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) has apologized to Sri Lanka Cricket over the incidents that took place during and after the Hero Nidahas tri-nation T20 final league match between Sri Lanka and Bangladesh at the R Premadasa Stadium on Friday.
In a media release the BCB states:
“The Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) regrets the unfortunate happenings during Friday’s Nidahas Trophy match between Bangladesh and Sri Lanka.
The Board accepts that conduct of the Bangladesh team in certain instances was unacceptable on a cricket field.
We understand that the events may have transpired due to the importance of the match and the pressure that comes with it but feel that the expected level of professionalism was not exhibited by the team while dealing with a tense situation in the game. The Bangladesh team members have been reminded of their responsibility in upholding the spirit of cricket at all times.
“The BCB and Sri Lanka Cricket (SLC) have a lasting bond which has a deep-rooted history of support and cooperation and the players of both sides continue to share an excellent relationship that gets stronger by the day.
“We look forward to a riveting end to the Nidahas Trophy which has been a brilliantly organised tournament.
It has been very competitive and well received by cricket fans around the world and the SLC deserves every praise for that. The Bangladesh team is proud to be associated with this competition.”
