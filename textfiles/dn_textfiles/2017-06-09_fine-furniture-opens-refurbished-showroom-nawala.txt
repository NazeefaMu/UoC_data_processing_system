Fine Furniture opens refurbished showroom at Nawala

Fine Furniture opened the refurbished new showroom recently at Nawala Road with a huge investment with 14 luxury European brands.
Martin Klement, Co Founder of Fine Furniture speaking to Daily News Business said that they have invested extensively for Fine Furniture at Nawala. "We are introducing some luxury European brands to Sri Lanka and now we have expanded to over 15,000 square feet of the showroom. We have every product that customer requires,” he said.
Martin Klement, a former structural engineer and his partner Niluka Klement, in a brief period of three and a half years have successfully established a new benchmark for luxury living in Sri Lanka and raised the bar vis a vis customer expectations and service .
“At Fine Furniture we promote the concept of investing in long-lasting, quality products with outstanding design, function and performance for a new way of living”, said Klement.
He promises his clientele a one stop shop that caters to the changing lifestyles and demands of today’s sophisticated consumer, providing an experience hitherto not encountered in Sri Lanka.
According to Klement the renovations which are currently ongoing have entailed a considerable investment which he says further underlies his commitment to Sri Lanka and his desire to bring the very best of European lifestyle products to the country.
“When we started Fine Furniture a few years ago, it was answering an obvious need for great kitchens, luxury interior products and furniture that represents the lifestyle of the upwardly mobile, modern Sri Lankan and Sri Lanka responded to us exceptionally! Furthermore with the real estate boom which has resulted in several international developers such as Clearpoint Residencies, Destiny, and Shangrila etc, flocking to Sri Lanka, not forgetting local entrepreneurs Blue Mountain and Achilleion, the need for furniture and fittings of an international standard have increased exponentially; hence our decision to expand and upgrade”, said Klement.
“At Fine Furniture whether your style is down to earth, creative, purist or romantic, the possibilities for creating an individual style are endless. Our exclusive partnerships with some of the most luxurious European home brands such as Koinor, Pacific Green, Flexa, Loddenkemper, Alpa Salotti, Häcker Kitchens German Made, Bosch, Miele, Brandt, Bovictus Metaltex, Eurographic and Masterlight have made us the obvious choice for total home solutions,” said Klement.
Today, Fine Furniture occupies a niche in the local market for superior and luxury furniture and fittings and has established a whole new paradigm for luxury living spaces in Sri Lanka.
