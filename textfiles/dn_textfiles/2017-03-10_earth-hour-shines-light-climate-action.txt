Earth Hour shines light on climate action

Following a landmark year for climate change WWF’s (World Wide Fund for Nature) Earth Hour is calling on people around the world to escalate the charge and be a part of the global momentum.
Earth Hour 2017 will be celebrated on Saturday, March 25, between 8:30 pm and 9:30 p.m. local time.
Last year was the hottest year on record. Earth Hour 2017 is our time to shine a light on climate action and build the foundation for a better future for our planet and future generations.
“Climate action today will decide what tomorrow looks like for years to come. Earth Hour empowers each individual to be a part of making climate change history, be it through a social event, interactive campaigns and even social networks,” said Siddarth Das Executive Director, Earth Hour Global.
Since 2007, Earth Hour has mobilized businesses, organizations, governments and hundreds of millions of individuals in over 7,000 cities and more than 172 countries and territories to act for a sustainable future. In the past years, WWF and Earth Hour teams around the world have harnessed the power of the movement to raise support and funds for access to renewable energy, protection of wildlife and their habitats, building sustainable livelihoods and driving climate-friendly legislation and policy.
In 2017, Earth Hour will continue to power grassroots efforts to change climate change.
In addition, as the world’s most iconic landmarks prepare to switch off their lights for Earth Hour, supporters are also invited to take a stand for climate action on their own personal landmarks – their social media accounts.
“It’s evident that Climate Change is real and it’s the most urgent threat our planet is facing today. For an issue of this magnitude we need to work collectively together in order to Change Climate Change. We need to take action now to save this beautiful planet, which is our only Home” said, Abdul Qadir Uvais – Country Manager and Coordinator of Earth Hour Sri Lanka.
“Growing up, we have all had dreams about our future, and the children of today are no different. But their dreams for tomorrow depend on our actions today. Therefore we urge you to join us to #ChangeClimateChange and help shape the Future of our Children and our Beautiful Country – Sri Lanka,” added Abdul Qadir Uvais.
