Established on June 14, 1973: Sri Lanka Press Council’s Forward March since its origin…

Sri Lanka’s Press Council has become the topic of the day on several occasions during the recent past within intellectual circles referring to Right to Information and press freedom, which created a massive social uproar fuelled by comments of the print and electronic media channels. Thus the need has arisen to outline the pathway of the Sri Lanka Press Council and its present role.
The Sri Lanka Press Council was first established as a Statutory Board on June 14, 1973, as per Regulations of the Press Council Act No 05 of 1973 under the purview of the then Ministry of Information and Broadcasting. Its present Line Ministry is the Ministry of Parliamentary Reforms and Mass Media

The Sri Lanka Press Council was operated under the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting from year 1973 to 1977, under the State Ministry from year 1977 to 1989, under the Ministry of Cultural and Information from year 1989 to 1994, under the Ministry of Mass Media, Tourism and Aviation from year 1994 to 1997, under the Ministry of Postal, Telecommunication and Mass Media from year 1997 to 1999, under the Ministry of Mass Media and Information from year 1999 to 2000 and for a short period from year 2000 to 2001 under the President.
At its inception in 1973, the first Board of Directors of the Sri Lanka Press Council consisting of six members was presided over by its first Chairman Senior Counsel A. K. Premadasa.
The Director of Information was an Ex-officio member in the Board of Directors. The greatest challenge before the first Board of Directors was to establish its impartial identity as an independent institution. As a result, it was the responsibility of the Sri Lanka Press Council to respect both parties; the complainant and the respondent, maintain an amicable environment within complaints inquired before the Council and to bring in justice to both parties in accordance with the Sri Lanka Press Council Law and its rules, while it was further responsible in making the society aware of its process of bringing in justice. Within a short period of time, the Sri Lanka Press Council was able to ensure its stand as an institution, which would not become a threat to press freedom.
The relationship between the journalists and the Sri Lanka Press Council had gradually grown as a result of journalists receiving the respect and dignity they deserved from the Sri Lanka Press Council. With the decisions of the Press Council, it was evident that press freedom would not be challenged by the Press Council. At the end of its first term, complainants and defendant journalists were mutually settling disputes at hearings before the Press Council and it was quite a victory for the Council to reach such status within a minimal period of three years.
Its first Chairman, Senior Counsel A.K. Premadasa, who rendered yeoman service to create the legal framework and physical infrastructure required for its firm establishment, had said goodbye to his post in 1974. Later, a veteran politician well-revered in the Government as well as in the Opposition and a Barrister, P.M. William de Silva, had been appointed for the post and served till 1977. After William de Silva, Presidents Counsel J.W. Subasinghe was appointed to the post in 1978 and served till 1986.
Code of conduct
With the clearing of initial hurdles, the Press Council had taken measures to introduce a Code of Conduct in 1981 with the contribution of veterans in the field, University lecturers, clergy and various mass organizations. The prime objective of this Code of Conduct was “to encourage journalists to act with self-discipline rather than legal pressurizing.”
Accordingly, the main focus of the Press Council during this decade (1973 – 1983) was to demolish negative responses aimed at the Council and to conduct fair and unprejudiced inquires and to cement the fact that the Press Council is vital for the betterment of Democracy. But at the time, the Press Council had been a novel experience in Sri Lanka and therefore, many were there to find fault with.
During the decade from 1983 to 1992, the misconception that the Press Council was an obstacle to press freedom had been dissolved. The few years of this decade had gone in history as the period in which the proposal of conducting seminars, workshops, courses and publication of literature on journalism had been submitted to the Board of Directors. “Puwathpath Kala Sameeksha – I,” the first compilation published by the Press Council had been first published in year 1992.
After the tenure of Presidents Counsel J.W. Subasinghe in 1986, Attorney-at-Law M. Hussain had been appointed in year 1987 and had served till year 1991. Later in the year, Attorney-at-Law A.L.M. Fernando, was appointed as Chairman.
During the decade 1993 – 2002, the first publication of “Puwathpath Kala Sameeksha – I, was launched by the Sri Lanka Press Council in 1993, Prof. Sunanda Mahendra had been the Consultant Editor, along with the contribution of all other veterans in the field. Furthermore, it had provided the opportunity for a series of controversial articles expressing views on various subjects in different perspectives. Journalists too had voluntarily appreciated this compilation. “Puwathpath Kala Sameeksha – I” can be recognized as standard literature related to the field of mass media. Subsequently launched was “Puwathpath Kala Sameeksha – II,” which had also been widely acknowledged. Some journalists referred it as “Pen Thudaka Aravindaya” (Blooming of a Fountain). Even today, these two books are used as hand books in Universities in the stream of mass communication. Furthermore, the book “An Access to Provincial News reporting” (2000) published by the Press Council is a guide to provincial journalists.

The primary focus of “Puwathpath Kala Sameeksha – III” (2003) was to present a scientific research study on obscene publications. This book had achieved key attention among a handful of publications on the subject within Sri Lanka.
Conducting of workshops and seminars
Sri Lanka Press Council has continued to conduct workshops and seminars and during the year 2002 alone, 35 awareness workshops for students and journalists. In addition, several diploma courses; i.e. Preparatory Diploma in Print Media, Bi-lingual Training Programme for Journalists and language proficiency courses were introduced by the Press Council.
During the decade, several professionals have chaired the Sri Lanka Press Council from time to time. After the farewell of Attorney-at-Law A.L.M. Fernando in year 1994, Attorney-at-Law A.A. De Silva was appointed to the post in the same year and held the post till 1997. In year 1998, Dr. P.V.J. Jayasekara was the Chairman of the Press Council. Later Dr. Jayasekara bid farewell in year 1999. A renowned Presidents Counsel in Sri Lanka Dr. Wijeyadasa Rajapaksha was appointed as its Chairman in year 2000, where he continuously served till year 2001. During his tenure, the Sri Lanka Press Council was able to remarkably achieve its desired goals.
In year 2009, a Board of Directors chaired by Prof Somarathna Balasooriya was appointed to the Press Council. Gradually, the conducting of various courses and workshops and the launching of publications had re-commenced.
Veteran Presidents Counsel W. Dayarathna held the post of Chairman from year 2010 to 2014. In year 2015, the Council had proceeded under the presidency of another reputed Advocate as well as writer, author and critic Counsel Koggala Wellala Bandula, while further reactivating various programmes. Accordingly, following in the footsteps of the previous chairmen, complaints received against newspapers were inquired systematically, efficiently and in an unbiased manner. Even though a number of complaints have been received by the Council, less than 10 complaints have issued orders of correction. It is the anticipation of the Council to conduct inquiries with the concurrence of the two parties and to ensure public rights, while making press freedom more meaningful.
90 percent of complaints received investigated 
From the date of its re-functioning, the Press Council had received many complaints from which investigations of over 90% of the above had been completed. Whenever the Council receives a complaint, it takes every possible effort to initiate investigations at its earliest and to arrive at conclusion within a period of 3 months.
In keeping with the recent social, economical and political changes, the Sri Lanka Press Council too has changed its perspectives. Accordingly, awareness of journalists and their welfare have become its foremost priorities. It is the expectations of the Council to create journalists, who could face future challenges by being empowered with theoretical and practical subject-related knowledge and also to engage them in the national development drive and create well-disciplined modern media culture. Among the programmes initiated in realizing the above goals, is the one year Diploma in “Journalism and Communication Studies.” The Diploma is designed for professional journalists as well as new entrants in the field and it has been based on UNESCO guidelines on journalism training. The awarding of certificates of the 4th batch of this Diploma was held recently under the patronage of the President and the participation of line Ministers. Studies of the 5th batch are currently underway, while the course co-ordinator was Prof. Sunanda Mahendra.
The Council is of the view that re-commencing the English Language Certificate course was initiated with the intentions of upgrading language proficiency of professional journalists. Furthermore, the Council conducts seminars and discussions on the subject prescribed for the G.C.E. (A/L); Media and Communication Studies to update the knowledge of students in rural areas away from the city of Colombo. Accordingly, a number of workshops were conducted at Education Zonal levels. It is expected to upgrade media literacy and appreciation in school students.
Media workshops conducted at district level
Media workshops conducted for provincial journalists have turned effective and attracted many journalists. Media workshops are being conducted at district level on selected contemporary significant issues in view of upgrading theoretical and practical knowledge of provincial journalists. The workshop organized under the patronage of the Minister and Deputy Minister and conducted for journalists in Jaffna in March the previous year, was quite significant.
Sri Lanka Press Council identifies and conducts research on contemporary and significant issues with social and cultural repercussions and guides respective parties in its relation. Accordingly, the Council is currently conducting several researches in collaboration with universities.
Since its inception in year 1973, the Press Council has launched several publications from time to time. Even though these publications were centered around journalists and journalism at the beginning, the Council has decided to launch publications to cover various other media. Accordingly, the magazine “Maadya Sameeksha I” was launched in year 2010. In year 2011, five hand books for journalists named “Sannivedana Vividhanga” – (“Source and Development of Sri Lankan Newspapers,” “An Introduction to Media Literacy,” “Language and Communication,” “Media Education and Newspapers” and “An Introduction to Photographic Journalism”). Sri Lanka Press Council has launched “Maadya Sameeksha - II” to coincide with its 40th Anniversary which had been edited by senior journalist Karunadasa Sooriyarachchi.
Among other functions conducted by the Press Council, we find conducting subject related seminars and workshops at the request of private institutions and organizations, registration of School Media Associations, conducting Symposium on significant publications and conducting a series of monthly seminars.
With the establishment of the Sri Lanka Press Council in year 1973, registration of newspapers had become one of its prime objectives. In the absence of a central systematized state institution for registration of newspapers, the Sri Lanka Press Council has been able to ensure the nature of newspapers in Sri Lanka in accordance with the highest recognized standards as well as to discourage obscene or defamatory newspapers. Therefore, registration of newspapers has become the most significant function of the Press Council today.
Chairmen and Board of Directors appointee from time to time had been well-versed veterans equipped with knowledge and experience in each field. The services of the members of previous and current Boards of Directors in successful and effective operation of the functions of the Council should be appreciated. In addition, the contribution of the Press Commissioners, who were responsible for its administration during the past forty years, is commendable.
Senior panel of experts at the helm
A senior panel of experts representing diverse disciplines act as members of the present Board of Directors. Senior Attorney Koggala Wellala Bandula (Chairman), Prof. Sunanda Mahendra, Prof. Rohana Lakshman Piyadasa, Senior Journalist Gamini Sumanasekara, Senior Journalist Ariyananda Dombagahawatta, Senior Journalist S. Thillainathan and Dr Ranga Kalansooriya, Director General of Information function as Board members.
It will be the expectation of the Sri Lanka Press Council to continue the service rendered by the Council during the past four decades amidst public accolades in a far more attractive and effective way, while educating journalists and securing press freedom as well as public rights in realization of the ultimate goals of creating a better media culture.
