Royal regain E F C Pereira Challenge Trophy

Royal College, Colombo edged out their traditional rivals S. Thomas' College, Mount Lavinia 3/2 and walked away with the E F C Pereira Challenge Trophy as the 13th traditional tennis encounter between the two schools concluded at the Royal College tennis courts recently.
Now the tally moves to 9/4 in favour of Royal. Royal had won the trophy continuously the first 7 years, before STC recorded their first win in 2012. STC were able to retain the trophy consecutively for two more years until Royal claimed it back in 2015. Last year, once again STC were able to regain some of their lost pride in a closely contested match to grab the victory 3/2.
Victorious Royalists were captained by Mihindu Samarasinghe this year while Avindra Perera, who is the present national junior champion and Davis Cup poolist led the Thomians.
Despite bad weather conditions, the tie got off with the first singles between Davis Cup poolist Avindra Perera (STC) and Junior Davis Cup player Kavisha Ratnayake (RC). The first doubles played between Avika Kelegama and
Dhilvan Herath (RC) against Rakesh Ratnasingham and Akira Perera (STC) ended in a draw.
Avindra pulled off his singles match to push STC into a 1 nil lead at the onset but Royal made it 1/1 with Avika and Dhilvan winning their doubles match.
Both teams were trying hard to break the tie by winning the next two matches, however that too ended in a deadlock with a 2/2 tie with the RC pair Mihidu Samarasinghe and Senal Hemakumara getting the better of Dulitha
Ellawala and Vihan Herath (STC) in the doubles match, while Avindra’s brother Shivendra (STC) winning a hard-fought battle over the Royal vice-captain Nadil Silva in their singles encounter. This, brought the battle right to the wire where Thehan Wijemanne (RC) was to take on Akil Ismail (STC) in the decider. Thehan pleased the large Royal gathering there winning back the trophy to Royal.
The winning Royal team comprised Mihindu Samarasinghe (Capt.), Nadil Silva (VC), Kavisha Ratnayake, Avika Kelegama, Dilvan Herath, Thehan Wijemanne, Senal Hemakumara, Venushka De Silva, Januda Jayasekera and Manish De Silva. The team was coached by Prasanna Athauda assisted by Master In Charge Jaliya Yasaratne.
Former STC tennis captain Shehan Meegama was the chief guest while Principal of Royal College, B A Abeyratne together with the former SLTA president and old Royalist, D L Seneviratne were also among the guests.
In the under 15 event Royal came out victorious with a 3/0 win, while in the under 13 event STC came out on top with a 3/0 victory.
