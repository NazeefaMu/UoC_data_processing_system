‘Year 2016, a success story in drug enforcement’

 The year 2016 has been a success story for drug enforcement in Sri Lanka but the job is not complete as drug traffickers had not stopped, said United Nations Office on Drug and Crime Programme Coordinator Shanaka Jayasekara.
He was addressing the launch of the International Narcotic Control board (INCB) Annual Report 2016 at the National Dangerous Drugs Control Board (NDDCB) yesterday.
“Drug traffickers need to know that the drug enforcement agencies are out-performing their colleagues in the region and Sri Lanka is no longer a soft transit location. However, this also becomes a challenge as we strive to improve on the records of 2016. We need to have higher seizures in 2017,” he said.
Jayasekara said the law enforcement agencies in Sri Lanka, be it the Police Narcotics Bureau, Sri Lanka Customs and Excise Department, have taken the fight against drug traffickers with its own resources and initiatives. The report stated that the amount of heroin trafficked into Sri Lanka continued to increase in 2016. Seizure data for the first half of 2016 indicated a sharp increase over the same period of the previous year.
The report stated that in 2016, the Police Narcotics Bureau with the support of other law enforcement agencies in Sri Lanka seized over 1,550 kg of cocaine. This included the seizure of 928 kg of cocaine on MV Fabiola when it arrived at the Colombo Port on December 9, 2016 from Ecuador. This was the largest seizure of cocaine in South Asia, a great achievement for Sri Lanka. In addition, consignments of 210 kg of cocaine seized on November 24, 301 kg on July 21 and 80 kg on June 15 account for the record seizure of cocaine in Sri Lanka.
It further stated that in 2015, South Asia continued to be particularly vulnerable to trafficking in opiates and heroin. Trafficking in cannabis, synthetic drugs, and new psychoactive substances also persisted in the region. Trafficking of heroin from South-West Asia to India and then to Sri Lanka, Maldives and countries in Western Europe was identified by the Narcotics Control Bureau of India as a major trafficking trend.
The theme of the INCB Annual Report 2016 is the impact of narcotic drugs on women.
The report identifies the disproportionate increase in drug overdoses among women and calls on member States to do more to take women into account in their drug policies and programmes.
The report calls on governments to give priority to providing healthcare access for drug-dependent women and calls for more funding and coordination to prevent and treat drug abuse among women.
