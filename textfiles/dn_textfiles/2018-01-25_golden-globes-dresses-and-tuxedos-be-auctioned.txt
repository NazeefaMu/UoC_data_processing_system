Golden Globes  dresses and tuxedos  to be auctioned

The Golden Globes 2018 saw the red carpet turn black with almost all celebrities turning up in shades of black to stand in solidarity with victims of sexual harassment in Hollywood.
While the actresses turned up in all black gowns, the men joined in with all black tuxedos and sporting Time’s Up pins. All those fans fanticizing about owning a gorgeous gown or tux worn by celebrities like Reese Witherspoon, Meryl Streep, Emma Watson, Hugh Jackman, Jude Law, among others, to the awards show might just have their dream come true.
According to international media outlets, an auction is being set up on an online marketing site to raise money for the Time’s Up Legal Defense Fund. This initiative will reportedly help provide legal and public relations assistance to victims of sexual harassment at workplaces. Reports state that a total of 39 gowns and tuxedos will go under the hammer when the auction goes live with bids reportedly ranging from $2,500 to $10,000 (based on prices suggested by the designers who donated the pieces).
