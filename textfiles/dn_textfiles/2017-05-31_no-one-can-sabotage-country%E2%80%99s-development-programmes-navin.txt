No one can sabotage country’s development programmes: Navin

The government would not allow anyone to disrupt or harm the country’s development programmes, Plantation Industries Minister Navin Dissanayake said.
He made this observation at a ceremony held yesterday to grant compensation of Rs.6 million and promotions to 66 employees of the Coconut Cultivation Board who were subjected to political victimisation during the previous regime.
He added that victimisation has become part of our political culture which should not continue any further.
“It is the responsibility of the employees of this ministry not to create a situation for the next government to organise a similar ceremony to grant compensation for employees subjected to political victimisation,” Minister Dissanayake said.
“Political vengeance is not accepted by disciplined societies.
One should be able to accept the views of the opposition as well,” the Minister said
Minister Dissanayake further stated these employees had been subjected to political victimisation since they had supported the Jathika Sevaka Sangamaya during the previous regime. He added that however, those employees had been granted 50 percent of their demanded compensation.
“The future of coconut cultivation, coconut development and research looks bright since we are seeking USD 50 million funds for the same,” Minister Dissanayake said.
The Minister also pointed out that it is the responsibility of the Ministry employees to achieve the desired targets set for them, as they are being paid with the tax payer’s money.
He also said the Plantation Industries Ministry also has planed to grant compensation and promotions to employees of other institutions who had been subjected to political vengeance during the previous regime.
Plantation Industries Ministry Additional Secretary Kumari Somaratne and Coconut Cultivation Board Chairman Kapila Yakandawala spoke.
