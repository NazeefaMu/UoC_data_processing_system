Joint TU Committee protest calling for General Election

The Joint Trade Union Action Committee (JTUAC) will hold a mass protest near the Fort Railway station on Tuesday (27), demanding early General Elections to end the current political impasse.
“Holding a General Election at the earliest is the best option to overcome the current political impasse. All political parties should agree to hold a Parliamentary election and let the people’s sovereignty prevail,” Sri Lanka Nidahas Sevaka Sangamaya General Secretary Leslie Devendra said.
He was addressing the media in Colombo yesterday.
Devendra said that the people were unhappy about the performance of the former UNP led Government and it should be up to the people again to appoint a government of their choice.
He said it was not prudent to hide behind the constitution or the law in an attempt to put off polls and added the best way out of the current imbroglio was to hold General Elections and let the people decide. Devendra said as trade union members and civil society members, the Joint Trade Union Action Committee has come forward to galvanize the people and ensure people’s sovereignty prevails.
While approving the President’s decision to appoint a new Prime Minister and change of governance, he said the UNP led government had robbed the Central Bank through the Bond scam, Sold state assets to foreign entities and brought the economy down.
Devendra said Tuesday’s protest was only the beginning and the the Joint Trade Union Committee will organize similar events until elections are held.
Meanwhile, Public Service Trade Union president W.H. Piyadasa said the UNP’s economic policies which are based on new liberal and capitalist concepts were not suitable to Sri Lanka.
He said Ranil Wickremesinghe’s new liberal economic policies had only pleased the west and had undermined local enterprises and the development of agriculture.
