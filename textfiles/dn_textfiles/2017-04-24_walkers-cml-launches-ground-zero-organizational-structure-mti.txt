Walkers CML launches Ground-Zero Organizational Structure with MTI

The new organizational structure for the Walkers CML Group was presented to the Senior Management and Executives of the Group at an event held recently at Hilton, Colombo with the participation of over 800 employees. The existing organizational structure was evaluated by MTI and restructured in order to facilitate the growing business needs of the Group.
In 2014, MTI was appointed to advise Walkers CML on developing a Strategic Plan covering a 5 year period up to the financial year 2020. MTI developed the Strategic Plan by employing its internationally acclaimed 8S(r) Model framework to execute the project. This framework facilitates the engagement of the management team through a highly inclusive process of strategic planning consisting of eight stages namely; Scope, Scan, Sights, Strategy, Structure, Staff, Sustainability/Social Responsibility and Systems.
The Ground-Zero structure proposed by MTI as part of the Strategic Plan, is divided into seven clusters which will complement the Strategic Plan of the Company. The cluster based structure will focus on sharing knowledge and resources, achieving corporate synergy and enable greater senior management focus on growth opportunities whilst streamlining the role of the corporate functions towards delivering value to the operational business areas.
“We are happy to launch the new organizational structure which has been developed to match the core business operations of our organization. I thank MTI for developing a holistic organizational structure that has been customized to suit our Group profile and growing business needs,” said Jehan Amaratunga, Executive Deputy Chairman of Walkers CML Group.
“We evaluated the organizational structure and identified the need for a hybrid solution combining the aspects of domain, value-chain, functional and engineering capabilities of the Group. The new structure will ensure efficient running of the organization and propel the Group to greater heights” said Hilmy Cader, CEO of MTI during his presentation at the event.
