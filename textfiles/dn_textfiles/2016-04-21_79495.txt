EU ban on Sri Lankan fish exports lifted

 
The EU ban imposed Sri Lankan fish exports has been lifted,  Fisheries and Aquatic Resources Ministry stated.
 
Earlier it was reported that a high level discussion to decide on the lifting of the European Union fishing export ban imposed on Sri Lanka was scheduled to take place today (21).
 
Fisheries and Aquatic Resources Minister Mahinda Amaraweera said that relevant documents pertaining to removal of the ban will be received by Sri Lanka in the coming month. Sri Lanka's seafood exports were severely hit by the ban and continued to decline since the announcement of the ban in October 2014. "The EU ban took effect over the previous government's failure to prevent local fishermen from violating international fisheries laws," he added.
