Gift-wise New Year

The common belief is that the god of the sun begins his journey in the month of April. Bak alludes to prosperity in Sinhala. That connotation led to the genesis of the month’s name. The Sinhala Buddhist community celebrates the dawn of the month with a new hearth boiling new rice.
And the National Library Services Board has much to offer on the occasion.
To coincide with the 28th anniversary of the National Library and Documentation Services Board (NLDSB), a book exhibition titled as ‘Bak Mahe Poth Mangalya 2018’ will be held at the National Library premises from April 4 to 8 from 9 am to 8 pm under the theme ‘Gift a Book for New Year’ under the supervision of NLDSB Assistant Director Kusala Sajivani.
“The real education is not confined to towers, buildings, cities and vehicles. A real education creates a citizen instrumental in the societal growth. On the contrary, the current education system is manifesting a generation of generation as against the rich tradition of Anuradhapura civilisation. Education must fulfil not only the worldly, physical and mental growth but also the spiritual growth of the humans. It is not only the teachers who are responsible to this, but also the parents, the elders, the government as well as the media. Education must succeed in resolving the conflicts as well as revolving the internal human knowledge. To achieve this end, the most practical end is to persuade the child to read books,” Sajivani said.
Reading is a vital factor in order to build a proper society. It will be a vital step in listening to the other, bearing, reconciliation, understanding the other’s mutual feelings, utilise the literature and achieve the challenges.
NLDSB is geared to make arrangements to gift a new book to introduce a noble concept. Inculcating noble habits are not so easy. As the National Library has taken on that initiative, Sri Lanka’s pioneer book publishers will take part in this exhibition with the objective to show how important this whole project is. Reading is an essential factor whether the education is proper, indirect, lifetime or self. We lived in a righteous society in the past.
“We have reached the information age thanks to the unique revolution of the information technology. But we are lost in the whirlpool of information without being able to decipher the accurate information from the fake. What is the use of physical development if we are yet to achieve the ethical development?” Sajivani questioned.
The National Library has offered the stalls for a reasonable price. A series of lectures has also been arranged for schoolchildren who face Scholarship examination, O/Ls and A/Ls. This series is aimed at proper entertainment beyond the subject matter. Athula Ransirilal is also scheduled to deliver a special lecture on the art of dubbing to the university students and mass media students.
Still looking for the perfect gifts in the forthcoming New Year season? True, people are hard to please. Don’t worry. Step into the National Library premises, close to Independence Square, between April 4 and 8, and browse the books available for reasonable prices.
