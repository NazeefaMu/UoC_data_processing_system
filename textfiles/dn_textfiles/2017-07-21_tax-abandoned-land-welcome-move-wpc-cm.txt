Tax on abandoned land, a welcome move: WPC CM

The public showers praise on the Western Provincial Council for imposing the <U+200B>two percent
tax on the total value on abandoned lands in order to control dengue. It is observed that many land owners have since visited their abandoned lands and cleaned them up, Western Province Chief Minister Isura Devapriya said.
Addressing a press conference held at the Western Provincial Council Auditorium in Colombo yesterday, he said that presently it was the abandoned state lands which needs to be cleaned up as the public clamour for it. The issue would be brought to the notice of the President. A formal request would be made from all Cabinet Ministers to get the abandoned lands belonging to their ministries cleaned up as soon as possible in order to control dengue mosquito breeding.
According to the Chief Minister, fogging (fumigating) is useless when it comes to controlling the Dengue menace due to dengue mosquitoes hiding in places where the fumes do not reach directly. Therefore, fogging only helps give the public just mental satisfaction. All types of chemicals used for mosquito control such as mosquito coils, Malathion, etc are poisonous to the people. It would take at least two years to find a scientific solution for the control of the dengue mosquito. Therefore it was the responsibility of the people to keep their premises free of mosquito breeding sites.
The CM does not have any right to dump garbage at Karadiyana. This garbage storage would be modified, while a new project would commence soon. Garbage only from certain areas such as Maharagama, Boralesgamuwa, Dehiwala, etc., will be disposed there.
Responding to a question posed by a journalist, he said that he would campaign for filling up the entire nomination list from women candidates in the upcoming Provincial Council elections, which would not only be 25 percent. But here in Sri Lanka, less women come into politics because of culture., etc. Responding to a question posed by a journalist, he said that he would campaign for the filling up of the entire nomination list from women candidates in the upcoming Provincial Council Elections and not only 25 percent, but here in Sri Lanka, less women come into politics because of the existing culture in the country.
