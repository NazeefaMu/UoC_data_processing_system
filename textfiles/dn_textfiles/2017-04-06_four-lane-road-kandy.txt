Four-lane road for Kandy

As the government devices various ways to get to ease traffic congestion and air pollution in the city of Kandy, State Minister of Development Strategies and International Trade Sujeewa Senasinghe said, the main issue was that there was no consensus between the Mahanayaka Theras in Kandy over the re-opening of the road in front of the Dalada Maligawa.
Environmentalists and planners have pointed out that the re-opening of the road would reduce congestion, ease traffic flow, and minimize the concentration of air pollution in one area.
The government instead has decided to build a four-lane roadway comprised of tunnels to connect Tennekumbura and Suduhumpola to reduce traffic congestion in town at a cost of USD 252.3 million. Higher Education and Highways Minister Lakshman Kiriella earlier this year said, steps would be taken to construct a bridge across the Kandy Lake to ease the movement of traffic.
Senasinghe informed the cabinet media briefing that while the Mahanayake Thera of the Malawatte Chapter was agreeable to re-opening the road, the Mahanayake Thera of the Asgiriya Chapter was opposed to it.
“We can’t go against the Mahanyaka and open a road. We have a government to run,” said Minister Rajitha Senaratne, while Senasinghe added, “It is easy to close things, but harder to re-open them. When we go to open it, we also open a whole other can of worms.”
UNESCO, in the meantime, has issued warnings repeatedly that Kandy would lose its World Heritage City status if the pollution was to continue. Kandy City was declared a UNESCO World Heritage cultural site in 1988.
