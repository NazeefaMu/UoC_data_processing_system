Sales of ice cream are melting away!

Amount sold across the world falls by 2.6bn litres in just two years as consumers opt for healthier lifestyles Whether you are on a beach holiday, sitting at home in the garden or even at a fancy restaurant, ice cream has always been the go-to treat for many.
But global ice cream sales have recently seen a large drop – and it’s all down to healthy eating habits.
A new report has revealed that sales across the world totalled 13 billion litres last year compared to 15.6 billion litres in 2015.
Market experts have explained that the trend is due to consumers being more aware of their sugar intake, and a movement towards higher-quality products.
Alex Beckett, global food and drink analyst at Mintel – the company which compiled the research - said: ‘More people are aware of the sugar content of food they are eating now. They are going into the ice cream chiller with their diet in mind.
‘While the industry is very competitive, prices have also had to go up due to cost hikes. People are eating less ice cream but when they do buy it, they want the good stuff – for example gelatos or Magnums.
‘It’s a treat so it will always appeal, but people are opting for quality over buying a litre tub. ‘Premium yoghurts are also becoming a more acceptable dessert.’
The report also revealed that although China is the biggest ice cream market, with sales estimated at 4.3 billion litres in 2016, Norwegians are actually the biggest ice cream eaters. Customers in the chilly Scandinavian country, where temperatures plunge to -6C (21F) in winter, ate 9.8 litres per person last year – around the equivalent of a family-sized tub each month.
Although Italy is famed for its ice cream and gelato, the research shows that 29 per cent of Italians are looking to cut down on their dairy consumption.
Despite sales being dominated by Western markets in recent years, rising popularity in the dessert is rippling throughout the East. India, Indonesia and Vietnam are among the world’s fastest growing markets, with India expected to overtake the UK in sales next year.
On the other hand, volume sales in Switzerland, Denmark and the US have decreased slightly over the past five years. Western consumers are increasingly looking to try ice cream products with more Eastern inspired flavours.
Japanese mochi ice cream – a treat of frozen rice dough around an ice cream filling – is gaining popularity, as well as Thai-style rolled ice cream.
