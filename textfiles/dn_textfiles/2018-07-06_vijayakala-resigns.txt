Vijayakala resigns

State Minister of Child Affairs Vijayakala Maheswaran has tendered her resignation letter to the President and Prime Minister yesterday, Government sources said.
The United National Party (UNP) has decided to conduct an inquiry against State Minister Vijayakala Maheswaran over her recent remarks in Jaffna.
She called for the reorganisation of the outlawed terrorist group to curb crime in the North.
A committee charged with examining alleged breaches of discipline is to be named today, UNP sources said.
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe summoned Maheswaran to Colombo following her controversial statement and on Wednesday evening had a lengthy meeting with the state minister at Temple Trees.
Government sources said Vijayakala had decided to resign from her ministerial portfolio following the meeting with the Premier. Irrespective of Vijayakala’s resignation, the UNP will conduct its inquiry against the state minister, party sources said.
The State Minister came under fire from her own party, the UNP as well as from other political parties in the legislature for making a controversial statement at a public function in Jaffna recently, calling for the reorganization of the outlawed terrorist organisation LTTE.
