Traditional Christmas Cakemixing at the Taj

Christmas is never Christmas without its finest traditions. One of its sweetest traditions was Christmas cake which originated in Europe centuries ago. The Christmas cake is a favorite amongst all that enjoy sweet treats during festive season, the world over.
Welcoming the much-awaited Christmas Season,Taj Samudra Colombo hosted the traditional Christmas Cake Mixing Ceremony on October 12 at the spectacular venue The Samudra Ballroom on the rooftop. The Cake Mixing Ceremony is an event that the hotel celebrates annually as a tradition. Taj Samudra heralded in the Festive Season this year by inviting those nearest and dearest to participate for the mixing of the traditional Christmas cake.
Taj’s Executive Sous Chef Samila Kumarasinghe and his kitchen team put up a marvelous show last Friday at the Taj Samudra! A decadent and fabulously adorned display of the cake mixing items weighing 325 kgs were mixed together by all our esteemed guests – colorful cherries to crunchy cashews, to warm brandy and of course the most important ingredient – love.
The mixing of the Christmas cake was followed by festive merry making, live entertainment by Wild Fire and laughter over delicate canapés and wine. It was an evening to remember and a cheerful start to a fabulous festive season at the Taj Samudra! - OG
