Kingsbury VESAK

Vesak spectators of Colombo were given an extra special treat at The Kingsbury Soup Dansala recently.
The dansala was opened by Chairman Hayleys PLC, Mohan Pandithage and received a tremendous response with over a thousand Vesak goers around the vicinity making their way to enjoy a generous cup of hearty vegetable soup and bread rolls.
Capturing the true spirit of Vesak, a special performance was also conducted by the Hayleys bakthi gee singers. Here are some highlights of the event.
