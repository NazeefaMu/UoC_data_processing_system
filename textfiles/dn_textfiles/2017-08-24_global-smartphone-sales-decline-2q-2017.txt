Global smartphone sales decline in 2Q, 2017

Global smartphone sales saw a modest decline of 0.8 percent in the second quarter of 2017, as market leaders Samsung and Apple consolidated their positions, an IDC survey showed.
The South Korean
giant maintained the top spot with a 23.3 percent market share, while Apple held onto second place with 12 percent, according to IDC.
Huawei was the third-largest vendor, with an 11.3 percent market share. The Chinese electronics giant closed the gap with Apple, adding two percentage points to market share from a year earlier, according to the survey.
China-based Oppo and Xiaomi rounded out the top five.
Samsung is in stride with a recently released Galaxy S8 flagship phone, seemingly recovered from an embarrassing recall of a Galaxy Note 7 model due to batteries catching fire.
