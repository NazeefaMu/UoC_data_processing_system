World’s smallest advertisement

A Connecticut manufacturing company broke a Guinness World Record by creating an advertisement smaller than the width of a human hair.
ASML announced it broke the record for the world's smallest advertisement by creating an ad that measures 22.37 micrometers by 7.76 micrometers and sports a surface area of 28 micrometers.
An average human hair measures about 75 micrometers wide.
"To truly go small you have to think big #smallest_ad ASML," the ad reads.
The ad broke the previous record for smallest advertisement, a 735-micrometer advertisement printed on a sesame seed by fast food chain Arby's in June.
