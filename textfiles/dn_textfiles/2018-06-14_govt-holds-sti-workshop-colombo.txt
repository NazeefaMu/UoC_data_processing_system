Govt. holds STI workshop in Colombo

At the request of the National Science and Technology Commission (NASTEC), the Science and Technology Policy Institute (STEPI) recently held a workshop on capacity building in STI (science, technology and innovation) for high-level government officials and researchers, in Colombo.
The ‘Capacity Building in STI Policy Formulation and R&D Commercialisation’ workshop was held from May 30 to June 5.
The workshop was designed to enhance the capacities of 50 senior-level officials and managers of the related science and technology government agencies, academia and research institutions.
Sri Lanka has set its national vision to become an upper middle-income country by 2025, by transforming the country into the hub of the Indian Ocean, with a knowledge-based, highly comparative, social market economy. To do so, the country tries to harness science, technology and innovation to create the conditions which will generate economic growth.
In order to realise the vision of national development with sound STI capacity, it is necessary for officials to be equipped with knowledge and expertise in establishing and implementing national STI policy, its action plans, and an efficient STI system.
In most cases, policy formulation and implementation in Sri Lanka are based on ad hoc approaches and intuition.
The NASTEC, under the Science, Technology and Research Ministry, requested STEPI to provide a customised training programme for STI stakeholders about STI policy development and R&D commercialisation mechanisms.
A special team from STEPI conducted this training programme with presentations on various policy tools, R&D planning and evaluation techniques and R&D commercialisation approaches with relevant case studies from Korea.
The inauguration ceremony was held on May 30 at the Sri Lanka Institute of Development Administration (SLIDA) auditorium, with the participation of the members of the STEPI team from South Korea, officials from NASTEC, Science, Technology and Research Ministry, and invited scientists and guests from institutes in Sri Lanka.
NASTEC Chairman Prof. Gunapala Nanayakkara, delivering the welcome speech, described the present situation in the science, technology and research in Sri Lanka. Dr. Eun Joo Kim from the STEPI team and Science Technology and Research Ministry Additional Secretary H.M.B.C. Herath also delivered speeches. The vote of thanks was delivered by Dr. Kalpa Samarakoon from NASTEC.
The outputs expected from this workshop are to acquire essential knowledge on framework, concept, schemes and tools involved in developing STI policies and managing national research and development (R&D) programmes.
It is also to share Korean experiences and practices which were applied in the fields, as well as to explore policy ideas that could be applied in the Sri Lankan context through discussions with Korean experts.
