Ministry inspects Pattipola Tourist Comfort Centre

The Tourism Development and Christian Religious Affairs Ministry dispatched a special team of officials to look into the status of the Tourist Comfort Centre attached to the Pattipola Railway Station, which is operated by the Department of Railways.
A photograph taken at the facility, where a foreigner was seen lying on a trolley, went viral on social media platforms and subsequently, Tourism Development and Christian Affairs Minister John Amaratunga deployed a team of officials to look into the current status of the facility.
The officials who visited the facility said the Tourist Comfort Centre was not dilapidated as portrayed by certain social media sites and other website reports.
They said the Tourist Comfort Centre is well-maintained and fully utilised by tourists visiting the area.
"There are hardly any complaints about the cleanliness of the place or bad maintenance. The Department of Railways is continuously working on its improvement and and the staff is working around the clock to ensure the proper maintenance," an official who visited the Pattipola facility said.
"During our discussions, the Pattipola Station Master said that the picture, which was shared on social media, had been taken when a tourist fell asleep on a trolley, while waiting for a train. He said some tourists preferred to sit outside and enjoy the beauty of the Pattipola railway station. When analysing the picture out of context, it may give a wrong idea about the comfort centre. But we can assure that the Tourist Comfort Centre is in good condition and it continues to be a useful facility to all tourists visiting the railway station," the Sri Lanka Tourism official added.
The Transport Ministry, the Tourism Development Ministry and provincial tourism authorities are currently working hand-in-hand to improve facilities and infrastructure for tourists travelling across the country.
