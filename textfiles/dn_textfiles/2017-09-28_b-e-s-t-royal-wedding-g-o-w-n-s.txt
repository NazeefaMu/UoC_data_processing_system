B e s t Royal wedding g o w n s

A royal wedding isn't just a union between two people and their families. It's a national and sometimes an international affair that attracts throngs of well-wishers, close media attention, and high-profile guests all hoping to catch a glimpse of the happy couple.
The Duchess of Brabant
Mathilde d'Udekem d'Acoz married Prince Philippe, Duke of Brabant in 1999. The wedding was held in December and included plenty of movement - to the Brussels Town Hall for the civil wedding, and then to the Cathedral of St. Michael and St. Gudula for the religious wedding, and then on to the reception - so a winter coat dress was called for. The coat was a silk crepe design with a tall collar and long sleeves. At the front, it closed with buttons and a trim line around the waist. The coat covered a simple sheath dress beneath.
Princess Claire
When British-born, Belgian-raised Claire Coombs married Prince Laurent (son King Albert and Queen Paola), the simple elegance of her dress won the day. Just as he designed her sister-in-law Princess Mathilde's triumph, NATAN's Edouard Vermeulen designed this dress for Claire. Claire wore the same antique veil as Mathilde, but here, Vermeulen accentuates the lace on the veil by adding an overlay bodice made of Chantilly lace from Calais.
Crown Princess Mette-Marit
This is a wedding dress you might not like at first. At first, it might seem way, way too simple, too bland, not enough sparkle. But just keep looking at it - eventually, it will hypnotize you. Designer Ove Harder Finseth collaborated with Mette-Marit on this surreal, dream-like interpretation of the fashions first worn by Queen Maud of Norway. The dress itself was created from thick custom-dyed ecru silk crepe and 125 meters of silk tulle. The two meter long train on the dress was unusually shorter than the silk veil, which was a whopping six meters long - nearly 20 feet! Such a veil does take a bit of management.
Diana, Princess of Wales
Diana wore an ivory silk taffeta and antique lace gown, with a 25-foot (7.62 m) train, valued then at £9000. It became one of the most famous dresses in the world and was considered one of the most closely guarded secrets in fashion history. The dress was designed by David and Elizabeth Emanuel, who described it as a dress that "had to be something that was going to go down in history, but also something that Diana loved", and which would be "suitably dramatic in order to make an impression".
Princess Margaret, Countess of Snowdon
This was also the first royal wedding ever televised, and was watched by over 300 million viewers worldwide, so her effect on ushering in the sleek styles of the 1960s could very well have stretched far beyond the royal family. Her dress was a white silk organza with a satin-bound silk tulle veil and not a stitch of embroidery in sight. The whole design was made to accommodate the princess's short stature, including the tiara.
Sarah, Duchess of York
Despite a wedding that took place in the midst of high 1980s fashion, this dress managed to eschew most trends in favor of an extremely flattering, classic design. Of all of the dress' elements, the only item that has fallen prey to the passing of time is the slight shoulder pouf of the sleeves. Designer Lindka Cierach didn't have an enviable task, working with Sarah Ferguson. The bride had a particular fondness for whimsical motifs, most especially bows.
Princess Maxima
Princess Maxima has her fair share of hot mess appearances, but when she gets it right, few can surpass her. In this Valentino couture gown, Maxima was at the top of her game. The dress was made of ivory Mikado silk. It was an excellent material selection; despite the fact that the wedding included lots of movement not a wrinkle was to be found.
The Duchess of Cornwall
She enlisted the design help of Robinson Valentine for her 30-years-in-the-making big day. For the civil service, they created a delicate cream silk chiffon dress and with a detail of woven disks made in Switzerland at the hem. Over that, she wore an oyster silk basket weave coat featuring herringbone embroidery. At her lapel, a Prince of Wales feather brooch. Beige shoes from LK Bennett, a purse from Launer, and headgear from Philip Treacy rounded out the look.
Princess Grace
Helen Rose from MGM's costume department was recruited to design the royal wedding gown. Rose used rose point lace on the bodice, veil, train insert and prayer book; Valenciennes lace for the skirt support and ruffled petticoat; and taffeta for the skirt. The dress was quite uniquely constructed.
Queen Anne-Marie
The Jørgen Bender dress isn't complicated: the gown is relatively unadorned - the lace detail on the skirt is hard to pick up - so the waist and the sleeve length are running the show here. And this has to be about the most perfect sleeve length ever.
