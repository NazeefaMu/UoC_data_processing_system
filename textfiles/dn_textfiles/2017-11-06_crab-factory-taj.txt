Crab Factory at Taj

Taj Samudra’s Crab Factory is the new indulgence for crab lovers. With a restaurant dedicated for the sole purpose of tantalizing your taste buds with a unique array of crabs prepared according to your preferences, it certainly is the place to dine in style.
Committed towards achieving high quality and consistent dishes that come to your table, the crab menu features an array of delicious cooking methods like bake, fry, braised and steamed. These authentically prepared dishes are further enhanced by the blending of distinct Asian flavours consisting of fresh herbs, mustard oil, fresh turmeric, Kashmir chilli and garam masala which is then prepared to perfection.
The freshly caught crabs vary in size and are served as traditional Sri Lankan crab curry and tandoori style crabs with the accompaniments such as butter naan, roast paan and strings.
The experienced Chefs are eager to please the guests with their expertly concocted dishes. In keeping with the restaurant’s “in season” philosophy, the dishes, sauces and soups are freshly prepared in house on a daily basis.
Though the restaurant per se is a veritable treasure trove for the single-minded crab aficionado, it offers a vast selection of sea food dishes and more from jumbo prawns, cuttle fish and lobsters. The menu places a high value on authenticity and taste with soups and appetizers such as mud crab cakes, crab pakoras and crab cocktails, leaving guests spoiled for choice. Moreover, one could not ignore the Crab Factory signature hot pot which is a fusion of many dishes bursting with flavour.
As with many choices in life comes the choice of creating your very own special crab dish with the each individual gaining the satisfaction of picking and choosing from a set of sauces and condiments to create that unique dish which is all about you. The menu also includes the Crab Factory Specials such as crab thermidor, which could be classed as a connoisseur’s dream dish, soft shell crab hot butter and much more.
To down the fiery albeit spice infused crab dishes are the cooling refreshments provided by the restaurant and for those who are unable to resist the temptation to indulge the sweet tooth are the mouth-watering desserts.
Exuding a relaxed ambience the bistro type restaurant offers a casual dining experience for guests during lunch and dinner.
