IPM Sri Lanka awarded ISO 9001:2015

IPM Sri Lanka, the nation's leader in HRM, was awarded the prestigious ISO 9001:2015 Quality Management System Certificate covering all its operations including branch operations in Galle, Kurunegala and Kandy.
The certificate was presented to Prof. Ajantha Dharmasiri, President, IPM Sri Lanka and P. G. Tennakoon, Chief Operating Officer, IPM Sri Lanka, by Gamini Dharmawardena, Director General, Sri Lanka Standards Institute (SLSI) at the recently concluded IPM National HR Conference 2017, held at the BMICH in Colombo.
“We are delighted with the ISO quality certification that we received. It symbolizes our continuing commitment to quality across all of our operations. We are thankful to the Sri Lanka Standards Institute for the guidance, help and support extended to IPM to achieve this landmark quality certification which is a first for our industry” said Prof. Dharmasiri.
IPM Sri Lanka's ISO 9001:2015 certification for quality management, which is the current version of ISO 9001 released in September 2015, follows the receipt of the ISO 9001:2008 certification in 2012.
“IPM Sri Lanka recognized the need for providing consistently high quality services to our various stakeholders in order to be successful in our journey of developing globally competitive HR professionals. ISO 9001:2015 provides us with the most current processes to provide high-quality services to our students, professional members and partners and to improve these processes on a dynamic basis according to market dynamics,” said P G. Tennakoon, Chief Operating Officer, IPM Sri Lanka.
The ISO 9001:2015 implementation team at IPM Sri Lanka was led by Ruwani Senevirathne, Manager, Quality Assurance, IPM Sri Lanka, who was supported by the IPM Sri Lanka family from all locations.
Valuable advice and guidance for the implementation was provided by the Chief Operations Officer who is the Management Representative of ISO, Quality Management System.
Receiving the new ISO 9001:2015 certification further substantiates IPM Sri Lanka's commitment towards continuous improvement to offer superior services to its stakeholders. With the embedding of quality systems into operational processes, quality has now been integrated to the system where a new quality culture has developed where people add value to the processes that drive the IPM standards.
