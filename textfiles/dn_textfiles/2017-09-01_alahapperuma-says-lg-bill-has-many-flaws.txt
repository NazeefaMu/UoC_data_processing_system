Alahapperuma says LG Bill has many flaws

UPFA parliamentarian Dullas Alahapperuma yesterday said the Joint Opposition (JO) was against the proposed Local Government Bill as it has many deficiencies.
“The Local Government mechanism will be in disarray if the government decides to implement the new bill,” Alahapperuma said.
He was addressing a press conference organised by the JO at the Dr.N.M.Perera Memorial Center, Borella.
He said the Government deceived the people by stating that after establishing the Election Commission, the powers to hold polls would be vested with the Commission.
Alahapperuma said it was proven now that the Commission has no power to hold polls. It was the Government in power which ultimately decide.
He said the new Act was presented in haste and the requests for a reasonable discussion had fallen on deaf ears.
He said the new bill had serious flaws and they should be rectified.
Alahapperuma said decision to deprive the rights of youths by prohibiting the government servants to contest the election was a crime.
