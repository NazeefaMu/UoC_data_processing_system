‘Shortage of  teachers in NCP will be resolved soon’

North Central Province (NCP) schools will be provided with enough teachers by July this year. NCP Chief Minister Peshala Jayarathna Bandara said.
He was addressing the ceremony held for pinning badges to the prefects of the Mahakanadarawa South Bank Dharmapala Vidyalaya recently.
The Chief Minister said 1,500 graduate teacher will be recruited by July to address the shortage of teachers in the province.
He said remote schools can produce eminent personalities like that prominent urban schools do. “I will resolve shorcomings of the Dharmapala Vidyalya before the end of this year,” he said.
