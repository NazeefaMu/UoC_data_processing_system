Stop stress eating

People deal with stress in several different ways - some chew on nails, others have sudden outbursts and some find themselves reaching for a bag of potato chips.
Stress eating is a common coping mechanism when dealing with pressure but it's far from a healthy way to handle stress.
Nutritionists agree that the bad habit can happen to anyone and reveal their tips to resist the urge.
They recommend going for a walk, ditching your cell phone and making a great music playlist, among others to distract the brain from wanting junk food.
Experts warn that when stress eating isn't managed, it can turn into a full-blown eating disorder which can lead to serious health issues.
The health risks of stress eating
Those who stress eat tend to overeat, which can later develop into unhealthy weight gain.
Stress is caused by a spike in the hormone called cortisol, which elevates blood sugar levels and makes the body crave sugar.
This makes people tend to reach for sweets and different types of junk food.
These foods are not only loaded with sugar, but are high in carbs, calories and fat.
They often have little fiber, protein or any nutritional value.
High consumption of these foods can lead to people being overweight and obese, which increases the risk of heart disease and diabetes.
Ways to beat stress eating
1. Go for a walk
Lyndi Cohen, of the Nude Nutritionist, said going for a walk is the simplest thing to do to combat stress eating.
The Australian native said she had a first-hand experience with stress eating and once she realized the signs, she dropped 40lbs.
Cohen said: 'Often, we stress eat out of habit and instinct.
'So going for a walk can help break the cycle, by distracting your brain from the cravings and help you get endorphins from somewhere other than chocolate.
'Even a 10 minute walk has been shown to help buffer stress by increasing these "feel good" chemicals released in your brain.'
She said to wait an hour to see if these cravings still exist before eating.
Cohen added: 'By creating this "buffer period", you allow time for the craving to go away and for your stress levels to reduce.
'If you aren’t willing to delay gratification for an hour, I’d still recommend trying to distract yourself, even if it’s for just 10 minutes or half an hour.'
2. Ditch your cell phone
Dietitian Cassie said that although phones seem to be a form of distraction, it ultimately doesn't give people an intentional break from stress.
She said that sometimes work emails or unwanted texts can creep into mindless phone time, spiking stress levels.
Cohen adds: 'Also, scrolling on your cell phone while you’re eating creates mindless eating so you’re more likely to overeat.
'Put your cell phone down, monitor how long you scroll for and become a mindful eater by turning off devices when you eat.'
Cassie agreed and said: 'Using a phone can be seen as an escape but there is still that buildup of stress. You need to be intentional with how you are relaxing.'
She explains that stress is caused by a hormone called cortisol, which increases blood sugar levels and makes the body crave sugar.
Cassie said: 'This is why we crave sugar or high carb foods when we are stressed. Relaxation techniques are super effective because if you stabilize your blood sugar levels you won't crave the sweets.'
3. Make the perfect playlist
Cohen said making a playlist is a perfect way to de-stress because music is a natural relaxer.
She said focusing on calming songs and compiling them into a track list will distract the mind from craving sugary or salty foods.
Cohen suggests: 'Try listening to music that puts you into a good mood or new music that will engage and distract you. 'Another option is to listen to a podcast or a book as these can also take your mind off your cravings.'
Music has long been known to be a relaxation method, especially if it's classical music.
A study by German researchers last June found that the music of Mozart and Strauss significantly lowered stress, blood pressure and heart rates.
4. Get some sleep
If you find yourself eating away feelings of stress, you might want to try getting a better night's sleep.
Stress during the workday can lead to overeating and unhealthy food choices at dinnertime, research from the University of Michigan and the University of Illinois warns. But a good night's sleep can counter the effect of stress during the day on overeating in the evening, according to the June study.
Being well rested helps people to cope with unexpected problems at work and makes it less likely that they will turn to junk food in the evening, researchers said.
The study found that workday stress was linked to employees’ negative mood while on the job, which in turn was linked to unhealthy eating in the evening.
The study is one of the first to investigate how psychological experiences at work shape our eating patterns.

Why you need to get stress eating under control
Melainie Rogers is a certified eating disorder dietitian and founder of the BALANCE eating disorder treatment center in New York.
She agrees with the tips to keep stress eating at bay and said that if the issue isn't handled, it can develop into a full-blown eating disorder.
Rogers said: 'If someone isn't able to use these methods to control their eating, then it can turn into a cycle of emotional eating or binge eating.
'They will obviously gain weight and then eventually try to go on a diet. But because they never addressed the root of their problem, they will eventually fall off the wagon, whether in a week or a month.
'They'll end up over-eating again, stress about it, and a wave of binge eating starts. They can end up with a full-fledged eating disorder.'
The expert said besides the physical aspect of weight gain, lots of people with this kind of eating disorder have anxiety and depression.
Their self-esteem and confidence plummets, and they just feel out of control, Rodgers added.
Rogers said those who feel they are stress eating must first acknowledge their problem and then use tips to combat the eating.
She said if a person can't use the self-help tips, then it may be time to seek out a professional dietitian or therapist.
