Switzerland, Sri Lanka ties strengthened

Swiss Justice Minister, Simonetta Sommaruga has agreed an extended migration partnership accord with Sri Lanka.
On Monday, Sommaruga signed a Memorandum of Understanding in Colombo with Interior Minister Seneviratne Bandara Nawinne reaffirming cooperation, according to the Justice Ministry.
Sommaruga said Switzerland will increase its support to Sri Lanka to promote democratic reform, a ministry statement said.She said the migration partnership set conditions to strengthen human rights and create better prospects for young people in Sri Lanka through vocational training projects. Sommaruga met President Maithripala Sirisena and ministers and representatives of the National Human Rights Commission and several civil society organisations including members of the strongest political party, the Tamil National Alliance.
During her four-day trip to Sri Lanka, she will look into labour migration programme led by the Swiss Agency to develop external link.
The visit will gain first-hand information on the reconciliation process following the end of the 30-year civil war in 2009 and the rule of law in the country, notably the labour migration to Gulf States and Asian countries.
In 2016, Switzerland and Sri Lanka signed a bilateral immigration treaty covering the repatriation of Sri Lankans who no longer fulfill the conditions for continued residence in Switzerland.
The non-governmental Swiss Refugee Council external link and the Swiss branch of Amnesty International external link have criticised the planned cooperation accord with Sri Lanka.
They said the reconciliation process in Sri Lanka was not sufficiently advansed and the human rights situation in the country was too problematic for closer cooperation.Switzerland offered shelter to thousands of refugees. About 51,000 Sri Lankans are in Switzerland. Half of them have acquired Swiss citizenship, according to the Jjustice Ministry.- Swissinfo
