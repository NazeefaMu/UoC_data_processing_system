Immediate steps to fill islandwide teacher vacancies

Kurunegala District UNP Parliamentarian and Education Minister Akila Viraj Kariyawasam instructed top officials of his Ministry to take early steps to recruit subject teachers for the existing vacancies at 352 national schools countrywide. Meanwhile, the minister decided to recruit qualified school principals for the vacancies at national schools. 
Since permanent principals are not available presently at nearly 210 national schools, acting school principals are covering the duties of principals in those national schools now. It was reported that many of them have not obtained required qualifications or experience to hold these posts. Hence, steps should be taken to replace them with qualified personnel in the near future.
About 1,500 graduates are to be recruited to be employed at provincial and remote schools of both, Kurunegala and Puttalam Districts of the NWP, said Kurunegala Senior Director of Education W.M.Balasooriya, speaking at a meeting of school principals held at Wariyapola Teachers’ Training Resources Centre, Kurunegala, yesterday.
