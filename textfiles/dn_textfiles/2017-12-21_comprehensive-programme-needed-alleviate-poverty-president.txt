Comprehensive programme needed to alleviate poverty - President

A well coordinated programme is necessary to alleviate poverty in the region and around the globe, President Maithripala Sirisena said yesterday.
The President was addressing the Bay of Bengal Initiative for Multi-Sectoral Technical and Economic Cooperation (BIMSTEC) Ministerial meeting held at the BMICH yesterday.
Social Welfare and Empowerment Minister S.B. Dissanayake and Secretary to the Ministry Shriyani Weerakoon also participated in the meeting as Sri Lankan delegates.
Having the ministerial meeting in Sri Lanka was of much importance since President Sirisena had earlier declared year 2017 as the Year of Poverty Eradication.
President Sirisena observed that all members of the BIMSTEC should work together to achieve its goals.
President Sirisena reminded the responsibility of the super power countries not to allow anybody in the world to die out of hunger. He also pointed out that the National Programme on Poverty Alleviation was launched in Sri Lanka this year.
The Bay of Bengal Initiative for Multi-Sectoral Technical and Economic Cooperation (BIMSTEC) is a regional organisation comprising seven Member States lying in the littoral and adjacent areas of the Bay of Bengal constituting a contiguous regional unity.
It constitutes seven Member States: five from South Asia, including Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Nepal, Sri Lanka and two from South East Asia, including Myanmar and Thailand.
Bangladsh Finance Minister Muhammad Abdul Mannan, Bhutan’s Finance Minister Namgay Dorji, Myanmar’s Deputy Minister of Agriculture, Thailand’s Minister of Internal Affairs and other delegates from all BIMSTEC countries participated in the event.
