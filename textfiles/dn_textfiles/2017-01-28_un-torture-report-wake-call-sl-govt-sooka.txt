UN torture report a wake up call to SL Govt.: Sooka

A UN report which was published yesterday describing a ‘culture of torture’ in Sri Lanka is a wake up call to President Maithripala Sirisena’s Government to comply with its obligations under international law and to the international community to put torture prevention at the core of its engagement with the new Government, the International Truth and Justice Project (ITJP) yesterday said. The UN report by Special Rapporteur Juan Mendez was published yesterday, following his mission to Sri Lanka last year as UN Special Rapporteur on torture.
The Special Rapporteur said he received credible reports to show “white van abductions” have taken place under President Sirisena's government in 2015 and 2016.
ITJP’s Executive Director Yasmin Sooka said this ‘devastating’ report rightly calls for an office which is independent of the Attorney General’s office to investigate and prosecute allegations of torture in Sri Lanka. “We have already offered to assist both the Foreign Minister and the Sri Lankan Human Rights Commission in identifying international experts to help set up such an investigative team. If they are serious about justice, this should have been done two years ago,” she said.
Sooka said there had been a deep seated reluctance to accept the evidence on the on-going violations, but without security sector reform these sorts of violations will inevitably continue.
“Denying the evidence of ongoing abductions because they are politically inconvenient is an unforgivable affront to the scores of victims whose cases have been painstakingly documented by ITJP, our medical colleagues and other human rights groups,” she said. The report says Sri Lanka’s progress in implementing UN Resolution 30/1 has been slow and transitional justice paralyzed.
