'Lanka needs int’l exhibition centre'

Sri Lanka needs to set up an international level exhibition centre said Special Assignments Minister Dr. Sarath Amunugama, declaring open the International Printing Exhibition.
Participating as the Chief Guest at the opening of the International Printing Exhibition, Minister Dr. Amunugama said that an international level exhibition centre is necessary for Sri Lanka and that action should be taken towards that end. The International Printing Exhibition was held recently at the International Exhibition and Convention Centre in Colombo.
He also engaged himself in fact finding conversation with the printers present.
The Minister acquainted himself with the way in which modern printing work is done efficiently and the problems faced by printers.
Speaking further Minister Dr. Amunugama said that a big contribution is being made to the Sri Lankan economy by the Sri Lankan printing industry. “The annual income earned in the printing industry today is US $ 200 million. The industry will before long reach the 500 million dollar target.”
“Today our country needs an international level exhibition centre. The present exhibition centre is not suitable at all for today. Therefore action should be taken to establish an international level exhibition centre. Such a centre is essential for Sri Lanka.”
“If we initiate action for establishing such a centre there are countries who will be prepared to contribute financially for setting it up. Therefore an international exhibition centre should be established quite soon,
“Sectors like the garment industry, the gem and jewelry industry and the printing industry contribute a great deal to the Sri Lankan economy. Such private sector industries have progressed a lot. The service performed by such industries in pushing the economy forward is immense. It is the duty of the state to encourage and assist such industries. Obstructing them will retard economic progress.”
Sri Lanka should be developed as a printing industry region. By doing, so it will be possible to earn a massive income for the country. We should do so. The full assistance and the attention of the government must be directed towards it.”
Chairman Commercial Bank, Dharma Dheerasinghe, Chairperson E.D.B Ms. Indira Malwatta, President, Sri Lanka Printers’ Association, Lal Jayawardhana, Secretary of the same organization, Ranjith Fernando, many printers and foreign delegates participated at this event.
