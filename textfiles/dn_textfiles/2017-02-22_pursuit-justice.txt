In the pursuit of justice

Former Deputy Editor of ‘The Nation’ newspaper Keith Noyahr was abducted at the entrance of his house, at Waidya Mawatha, Dehiwala, on May 22, 2008.
His was the first in a chain of lethal attacks on journalists, which turned out to be a key characteristic of the Rajapaksa administration.
The incident took place a day after ‘The Nation’ celebrated its third anniversary: The paper was then owned by Dr. Sena Yaddehige, Chairman of the Arpico group, who ventured into the industry on the backs of two weekend newspapers – Rivira and The Nation.
Nearly two weeks before his abduction, Noyahr - who was also the defense columnist of the newspaper - had written an article titled ‘An Army Is Not Its Commander’s Private Fiefdom’, severely criticizing the top-brass of the Sri Lankan Army on many matters.
The incident
On the day he was abducted, Noyahr had dinner at Queen's Cafe on Duplication Road, Bambalapitiya, with his Editor, Lalith Allahakkoon, and CEO of The Nation's publisher, Rivira Media Corporation, Krishantha Prasad Cooray.
Noyahr left Queen’s Café around 10 that night. He drove his own vehicle to his home, in Dehiwala.
At around 10.30 pm, Noyahr’s wife Roshini received a phone call from her husband: He told her he was almost home and asked her to unlock the front door for him.
When her husband had not arrived 15 minutes later, Roshini grew worried. When she checked she heard the rumbling of the car engine near the front entrance of the house.
It was her husband’s car – but no one was in it: The engine was running and the lights were on. The driver’s door was wide open, but Noyahr was nowhere to be seen.
Roshini immediately sensed that her husband, a well-known defence columnist, was in trouble. She called Gamini Abeywardena, another Deputy Editor attached to ‘The Nation’ and told him what had happened.
Abeywardena telephoned Allahakkoon, the Editor of The Nation and informed him of the incident. Alahakoon, recognizing immediately the gravity of the situation, rushed to Noyahr’s Dehiwala residence.
On his way there, he telephoned his CEO, Krishantha Cooray and briefed him about the phone call from Abeywardena. Cooray, who was in his apartment at the time, also rushed to Dehiwala.
When Allahakkoon and Cooray arrived at Noyahr’s house, the journalist’s two children were crying in distress. They pleaded with Allahakkoon and Cooray to bring their father back.
Allahakkoon, at that point, telephoned Former Defence Secretary Gotabhaya Rajapaksa, the de facto head of the Rajapaksa defence apparatus, and sought his intervention to find the missing journalist. When Allahakkoon said Noyahr was the defence columnist of the paper, Rajapaksa was quick to deny military involvement in the “disappearance”.
The Nation Editor even spoke to former President Mahinda Rajapaksa and urged him to ensure the release of the journalist. Rajapaksa said he was unaware of the incident; but promised to look into the matter.
Cooray spoke to Karu Jayasuriya, who was then a senior Cabinet Minister of the Rajapaksa government, and asked him to intervene in the crisis. Jayasuriya had also telephoned former President Rajapaksa. This ‘intense search operation’ by Noyahr’s colleagues, soon became a nuisance to the top echelons of the government.
Search
Noyahr’s colleagues – especially the journalists who had worked with him at ‘The Nation’ newspaper – gathered at the Dehiwala Police station to exert pressure on authorities to investigate the ‘disappearance’, but it was clear that the Police were not in a position to do anything, or that their hands were tied.
Shortly afterwards, the former head of the Colombo Crimes Division (CCD) former Senior DIG Anura Senanayake arrived at the Dehiwala Police station. Senanayake was known to be a close ally of former Defence Secretary Rajapaksa and his involvement in the investigation raised questions in the minds of the journalists who were present at the Police station.
Senanayake ran into an argument with Cooray when the latter said he suspected three top-notch members of the Rajapaksa defence apparatus to be the main culprits behind the abduction: Cooray had insisted the Police should record his statement - but Senanayake wanted to avoid it. The Senior Police Officer had then ventured that the reason for the abduction might have been a “personal dispute”.
Cooray and Allahakoon also contacted embassies, media organisations, newsrooms and other influential friends and alerted them on the ‘disappearance’. Noyahr’s mobile phone was switched off, but Cooray even managed to get a telecommunication service provider to monitor if there were signals from the journalist’s mobile phone.
Sometime after midnight, Cooray was informed that a mobile transmission tower in the vicinity of Dompe had captured signals from Noyahr’s mobile phone – this meant the abductors, or some other party, had switched on his mobile phone, for some reason. It was also lead on the possibility that the journalist was detained in that area.
As Noyahr’s colleagues had little faith in Police investigations, they chose to go to Dompe on their own to look for their missing colleague. They got into their personal vehicles and rushed to Dompe in groups.
Dompe was an area in which the military intelligence ran several safe houses during the final stages of war. Therefore, mobile signals coming from the Dompe area was an indication that Noyahr was in the custody of a group attached to the military.
The journalists who went to Dompe in search of Noyahr did not have access to military safe houses, but they looked for remote places in the area, believing that the abductors had abandoned him somewhere, to no avail.
Found
In the wee hours of Friday (May 23), Noyahr was found in Dehiwala – not very far from his residence. His clothes were torn and he was almost unconscious and his body badly bruised. It was clear that the journalist had been beaten up and tortured. He was rushed to the Colombo National Hospital
It became clear that the pressure exerted by Noyahr’s colleagues on the government had compelled the ‘abductors’ to release the journalist: His release also established a connection between the ‘adductors’ and the top echelons of the previous government.
While Noyahr was still at the Colombo National Hospital, the former Rivira CEO issued a statement explaining the circumstances leading to the attack:
‘His abduction followed a series of threats issued against him, and, according to Keith's close associates, seemingly because of his regular contributions to The Nation's weekly defence column published under the nom-de-plume Senpathi.
After what seemed like an endless vigil for Keith's family and friends, he was ‘released,’ but not before being brutally assaulted by his abductors.
I am joined by Keith's colleagues both at The Nation and Rivira and the wider media community, who have recognised both his valour and unprejudiced journalism, and therefore view this attack against him as a despicable act aimed at silencing a pen committed to the truth above all else.
We live in a nation where terrorism is a word much bandied about. Terrorism is words, ideologies and individuals; terrorism is also a convenient label, a weapon to be used against a political detractor and dissident. But terrorism by definition rises beyond individual and organisation.
Keith is a journalist by profession, but he is first and foremost a family man.
On Thursday night, his abductors rendered his two small children hysterical with grief and fear that they might never see their father again, presumably because they disagreed with what he wrote.
Keith remains at the Colombo National Hospital, receiving treatment for injuries sustained, the extent of which is not yet fully known. Journalistic principle aside, it was a heavy price to pay for writing an article.
Despite all evidence pointing to the contrary, we, at Rivira Media Corporation, remain hopeful that the authorities will seek to bring the perpetrators of this heinous act of terrorism to book. We recognise that while a strong campaign to bring Keith's abductors to justice is being waged, there are thousands in the very same plight, without voice and without hope.
In appealing for justice for Keith, we echo the same call for justice to be served to the hundreds and thousands of abductees all over Sri Lanka. We pray that this culture of impunity will be arrested forthwith - already too many have paid the highest price to satisfy the whims of a few.
We take this opportunity to thank our colleagues in the media for their stoic and unending support in this time of crisis. Keith, had he been in a better condition, would have been the first to recognise this support and offer his thanks.
It was Keith, more than any of us, who was the defender of media rights; he was at every protest against the obstruction of media freedom, he would personally insist on articles being published about journalists killed for doing their job. He embodied the best of journalism in this country.
One by one, journalists in this country have been silenced. When they have not been killed to stop them reporting, they have been intimidated into reluctance to pick up a pen again. We call on our colleagues in the media therefore, to stand up against this injustice. We urge you to join with us in a campaign to bring about true democracy in this country.
May our calls be stronger than ever before; may our struggle prove a force to be reckoned with. It is a moment for collective solidarity, a time to shun rivalry, a time to stand up for each other against the forces that seek to silence and destroy us.
Let us step up to the challenge, for Keith Noyahr, for the countless other scribes and perhaps for ourselves.’
Noyahr later revealed he had been “questioned” by the abductors about his sources:
They wanted to know who gave him the information he used in his defense column.
The journalist left for Australia no sooner he was released from the Colombo National Hospital and never returned.
Investigation
Now, nearly eight years after the incident, on the back of the good governance government, the Criminal Investigation Department (CID) has launched an investigation into the attack.
The CID recorded statements from many individuals who worked with Noyahr at the time of the incident and have also contacted the journalist to seek his cooperation to proceed with the inquiry.
Noyahr’s friends and the media fraternity have expressed relief that the investigation is finally seeing light.
On Saturday (18), the Criminal Investigations Department revealed it had arrested five Army personnel in connection with the attack that took place in May 2008, affirming the suspicions by Noyahr’s friends and colleagues, that the abduction had the backing of the military.
Among them is Major Bulathwatte, a senior Military officer – who is also believed to be involved in the assault on former Rivira Editor Uplai Tennekoon, seven months later.
The five men have been remanded till March 02 and the CID will continue investigations. But the question of who gave the order to abduct Noyahr remains unanswered.
Neither Major Bulathwatte nor any of the other military personnel suspected involved in the attack have any personal reasons for wanting to know who Noyahr’s sources were.
It is a clear and accepted fact they were merely carrying out orders given by higher authorities.
Finding these ‘higher authorities’ will be the next challenge posed to the CID and other authorities tasked with the investigations – especially in light of the fact that none of the ‘big fish’ implicated in any of the nets case wide by the various investigative agencies – the Bribery Commission, the FCID et al – have made any progress, in this regard.
