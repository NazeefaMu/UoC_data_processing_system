Health Education Bureau re-launched as Health Promotion Bureau

The former Health Education Bureau (HEB) which functioned under the purview of the Health Ministry was re-launched yesterday as the Health Promotion Bureau to widen its coverage.
The institution was re-launched by the acting Director General of Health Services Dr. J. M. W. Jayasundara Bandara in the presence of staff members, journalists, Health Ministry officials and invitees. The objective is to make the population healthier. Addressing the gathering after opening the Bureau, Dr. Bandara said with the assistance extended by media institutions, dengue reduced by 70 percent within four weeks. It was previously aimed to reduce dengue by 50 percent within four weeks.
“We should be ready to prevent Super Malaria entering Sri Lanka and to face it if it enters the country,” he said.
“We should give what is demanded by the people when it comes to health information. It is useless to offer what we know to them,” he said. The former Health Education Bureau was established in 1972. The Health Promotion Bureau is the centre of excellence in Sri Lanka for health education, health promotion and publicity of health information. Empowering and mobilizing communities for the improvement of life through health promotion principles is the main achievement gained for the last few decades, Dr. Bandara said.
