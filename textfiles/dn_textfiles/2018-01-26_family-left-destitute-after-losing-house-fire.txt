Family left destitute after  losing house to fire

A mother and her two children have fallen destitute without a proper abode following the destruction of their house at the Rambewa, Kahatagasdigiliya, near the 70th kilometre post on the Trincomalee Road in a fire, last December. The woman, N. A. B. J. Ranasinghe, said their house was destroyed in a fire on December 16, last year, while they were away.
All their possessions including a sewing machine and furniture items, were destroyed in the fire. Kahatagasdigiliya Police, who were informed about the incident, were conducting investigations to find the cause of the fire. The woman and her children are currently living in a make-shift hut built in the compound as they are unable to build a proper abode for themselves with their meagre earnings. Ranasinghe’s 19-year-old daughter was supporting them with the salary she earned as a garment factory worker and her 12-year-old son is still attending school. She supplemented the family income by working as a labourer when time permits.
Ranasinghe said her family would request philanthropists or good samaritans to aid them in building a small house for themselves. Members of the public wishing to help them financially are kindly requested to remit their contributions to account number 051200360042762 at the People’s Bank branch in Kahatagasdigiliya or the following address: N. A. B. J. Ranasinghe, 70 km Post, Trincomalee Road, Rambewa, Kahatagasdigilya.
