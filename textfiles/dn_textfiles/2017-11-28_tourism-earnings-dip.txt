Tourism earnings dip

In September 2017, earnings from tourism recorded a decline in comparison to September 2016 owing to the drop in number of tourist arrivals during the month. The moderation in tourist arrivals was mainly attributed to the decline in the number of tourists from China, Maldives, Germany and Russia.
