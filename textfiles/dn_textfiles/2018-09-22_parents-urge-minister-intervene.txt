Possible closure of Rajarata, Eastern medical faculties:
Parents urge minister to intervene

The Parents Union of the State Medical Students had sent a letter to Higher Education Minister Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe on the possible closure of state medical faculties of Rajarata and Eastern Universities, the media spokesman of the union Wasantha Alwis said.
He was addressing the media in Colombo yesterday. He said the state medical faculties of Rajarata and Eastern Universities would stop studies soon due to the lack of lecturers. The special payment promised to lecturers had not been made, he said.
According to Alwis, there is a severe shortage of lecturers in both faculties and as a solution, it was proposed to make an extra payment for lecturers. However, the Cabinet approval had not been granted for the proposal yet. Therefore, the payment had stopped and the lecturers are in crisis.
The attention of both Minister Rajapakshe and President Maithripala Sirisena should be paid to this issue and be solved as soon as possible because the studies of medical faculties had delayed for a long period due to the SAITM issue too, he said.
