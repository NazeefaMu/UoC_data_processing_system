To Valentine with affection

They beat the roads again – for a different purpose, this time. It was a long march into the well-lighted spacious chamber of Nelum Pokuna Theatre on February 19. They had no placards on their hands. They had no slogans to shout. Attired fully in white, this massive crowd of youngsters were on a disciplined walk to celebrate the Valentine’s Day.
Valentine’s Day has amassed enough wrath from all fronts for its evil influence on the youngsters. As this Day dedicated to lovers grew up in Sri Lanka, it generated ample news.
There has been positive responses from the religious clergy. Venerable Galagodaatte Gnanasara Thera, for instance, initiated a Sil campaign called Ama Vessa at Viharamaha Devi Park years back as a spiritual response to the Valentine’s Day. It ceased to exist over the years.
The Nelum Pokuna silently witnessed a packed audience in all its floors with young devotees standing as well. The evening began with Buddhist rituals, followed by Venerable Kiribathgoda Gnanananda Thera’s Dhamma talk and Question and Answer session. The priest made direct reference to concepts such as sex before marriage and internet pornography usually considered taboo in daily conversations.
The major focus of his Dhamma talk was on how Internet – facebook in particular – takes a toll on daily life. Our ancestors did not have internet, he said, and they lived a comfortable life. They had less worries. They had lesser problems. They had less healthy complications. And finally, there were only a few cases of divorce, or not at all.
The priest however did not directly place the blame on facebook. The social media should be dealt very carefully. Internet and social media offer you the luxury of noble friendship, but it is a territory dominated by bad influence.
The bad influence, the priest reiterated, generates bad effects on daily life. The humans require sensual pleasures. But if you go behind them the wrong way, that will only lead you to suffering a miserable life. Pleasing your senses the wrong way is like borrowed money, which leaves you with no satisfaction at all ultimately.
“The people are more interested in auspicious times and glamour for weddings. They pay a scant attention to the virtues. The marriages are plagued with countless problems because of obvious reasons,”
The obvious reasons include wrongful pleasure in senses. Times, whether auspicious or inauspicious, can hardly affect one’s life if they adhere to virtues properly. Most crises are originated because of bad company.
Venerable Gnanananda Thera cited an account of a porn addict who threw his smarthpone on a bowl of hot water.
“He wanted to get rid of that habit somehow. So he decided to get rid of the smartphone. But then how can the smartphone be responsible for his addiction? Even if he threw it away, over time he will need pornography again. He will be starving, and it will be a worse scenario the next time,”
The Thera offered two tips to get rid of the addiction: avoiding the habit as much as possible and substitute it with another hobby. Being without a smartphone could be good if it could only be put into practice. Whether you use a smartphone or not, what matters more is your effort.
“This is not going to be easy. You need to have the best of your efforts. The best effort followed by a wholesome habit will relieve you of the addiction,” the Thera said.
Everyone, Ven Gnananda Thera reiterates, has a guardian angel (Ishta Devatha). The guardian angel could be the relations from previous births. If they are in good states of birth, they will take delight in all the good things you do. When a newly married couple enters a poruwa, they should have had led a pious life. If they had not led a pious life before, no amount of auspicious times will save them from impending disasters. Probably the Ishta Devatha will leave you cursed. In such occasions, only the well practised virtues can help you out.
This life is to be enjoyed, not for suffering, emphasised the Thera. He went on to narrate several accounts of youngsters who suffer without being able to settle the heavy loans taken for glamorous weddings. Have your wedding beautiful and charm, the Thera offered a tip, and then you do not need big cash for a lavish ceremony. That will help you look at life with a sense of reality without being sentimental.
“Even if you have done many wrongs before, do not ever waste time thinking about them over and over again. That is the worst thing you can ever do. What happened in the past is gone. You cannot undo it. Try to do good as much as possible and aim your next birth in a heaven. If you will be reborn in a heavenly abode, then you will have a slight chance to enter at least the first sainthood before arahanthood. Then the effect of your wrongs will lessen,” the Thera said.
Opt for celibacy before marriage, rather than otherwise, the Thera advised. Such a lifestyle has more benefits than one can imagine. Comfortable and satisfied lifestyle aside, the young couple will also be entitled to bear smart and intelligent kids.
The pin-drop silence that ensued throughout the four-hour long session indicated one thing: the audience was attentive to Venerable Kiribathgoda Gnanananda Thera who ranged the riches of the Buddha’s teachings in order. This could probably come as a bolt from the blue in this day and age of much noise on the streets.
It was no walk against Saint Valentine. It was rather an evening that capitalised on Valentine’s Day to enlighten the younger generation about a happy and comfortable lifestyle. If he was alive today, Saint Valentine would have been overjoyed to see the February 19 crowd.
