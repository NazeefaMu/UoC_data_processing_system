P!nk scores her second Number 1 album

Congratulations to P!nk, whose new album Beautiful Trauma lands straight in at Number 1 on this week’s Official Albums Chart.
The singer-songwriter’s seventh studio album shifted 70,000 across physical, download and streaming equivalent sales to top this week’s chart, earning the star her second Number 1 album in the UK, after 2008’s Funhouse. 64% of P!nk’s sales this week were physical purchases, and the album’s total opening week number is more than double her nearest competitor, Liam Gallagher’s As Your Were, which drops from 1 to 2.
P!nk tells OfficialCharts.com: “Wow… a Number 1 album! Thank you UK for continuing to support me. Two very happy ladies here today <3” Agencies
