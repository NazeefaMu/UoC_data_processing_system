Flippin’ great!

Pancakes are already awesome to eat, but one Japanese chef also turns them into works of art.
Keisuke Inagaki is a chef at La Ricetta in Zama City, has turned the lowly pancake into a veritable canvas, putting designs of everything from Pokemon characters to portraits of pets, according to Barcroft TV.
Each pancake masterpiece takes about 20 minutes: 5 to 10 to draw the outline and 5 to 10 to cook the incredible flapjack.
As you might expect, this Picasso of pancakes has flipped his passion into a huge Instagram following. Inagaki discovered his pancake passion in the aftermath of the 2011 Fukushima nuclear disaster.
“After Fukushima I participated in a camp for children to comfort them,” he told Barcroft TV. “I wanted to think of some activities that mothers and children could do together. Then I discovered pancake art. I saw it for the first time on TV, an American named Nathan Shields making it and thought it was interesting. Whilst children were playing, the mothers and I wanted to surprise them.”
Although most of Inagaki’s edible artworks get consumed quickly after they are served to customers, he has his eye on posterity.
“There’s vacuum packing available, and you can present your work in this way,” he told Barcroft TV. I think it would be fun to do a gallery show if I create enough pancake art.”
It’s certainly food for thought!
