England Lions arrive for tour : Sri Lanka A team to be picked after trial game

Sri Lanka ‘A’ team coach Avishka Gunawardena said he hopes to fulfill his duties to the best interest of the country and make the forthcoming series against England Lions a success.
The former attacking batsman who represented Sri Lanka in six Tests and 61 ODI’s stated that he is very happy to provide the opportunity to some youngsters to enter the national squad during his period as ‘A’ team coach.
The England Lions series will consist of four-day matches and five limited over matches where the first and second limited over matches are scheduled to be played at Dambulla International Cricket Stadium with the third match at Kurunegala on March and the fourth and fifth limited over matches at CCC grounds on March 9 and 11 respectively.
The Sri Lankan squad to face England counterparts has not been selected as yet and Gunawardene said that it will be selected after a practice match. According to coach Gunawardena the selectors are expected to give a chance to some under-19 players who have arrived in the island on March 6 after touring South Africa.
England Lions will be captained by 24-year-old Keaton Jennings who played against India in the recently concluded Test series. Jennings entered the record books by hammering a century in his very first Test innings scoring 112 against India in the fourth Test.
Jennings seemed very confident and said he is looking forward for a competitive series.
The English team has undergone special training sessions in Dubai as a preparation for the tropical climatic condition and their coach, former Zimbabwe captain Andy Flower said his team is ready to take the up the challenge with their morale high following a comprehensive training of three months.
