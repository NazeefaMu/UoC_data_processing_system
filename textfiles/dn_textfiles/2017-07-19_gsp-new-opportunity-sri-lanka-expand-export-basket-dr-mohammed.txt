GSP+ new opportunity for Sri Lanka to expand export basket - Dr Mohammed

The regaining of GSP Plus concession has given a new opportunity for Sri Lanka to expand its export basket, said Senior Trade Felicitation Advisor International Trade Centre, Dr. Mohammed Saeed.
Speaking at the MoU signing ceremony of the National Institute of Exports (NIOE) and International Trade Centre (ITC), a UN agency based in Geneva, he said that Sri Lanka should be able to enjoy this facility at least for the next five years and the country should exploit this situation.
“I have observed that though this concession is extended for over 7,000 products, Sri Lanka have not exported some products at all and these untapped areas should be focused on soon. More education to exporters too should be given and we are working with the Export Development Board and some universities in this regard as well,”he said.
Saeed said that it was also important that the NIOE also came on board to educate the exports in these areas and other export related issues by singing a MoU with them to launch educational programs in this direction.
Chairman NIOE, Dr. Jagath Peiris said that they conduct professional training courses related to exports currently for the certificate and diploma levels.
He said it is an honour for the NOIE to be recognized by ITC in recognition of the work carried out by the NCE through the NIOE for the benefit of exporters to raise awareness on the benefits of the Trade Facilitation Agreement and to be better acquainted with the export procedural tasks associated with successful trade.
“The courses enable those who are employed in various capacities in export enterprises, as well as school leavers who wish to engage in the field of exports to advance their careers.
The MoU is a part of the implementation of an EU-funded project in Sri Lanka aimed at strengthening trade competitiveness of Sri Lankan SMEs in regional,SAARC and ITC,” said, National Chamber of Exporters, President, Ramal Jasinghe.
“This would also help expand exports, said Secretary General, CEO, NCE, M. Shiham Marikar
