Justin Timberlake concert film to debut on Netflix

Justin Timberlake’s 20/20 Experience World Tour concert film is heading to the small screen this October.
Oscar-winning director Jonathan Demme filmed Justin Timberlake and The Tennessee Kids in Las Vegas, during the final date of the pop superstar’s mammoth 134-city 20/20 Experience World Tour, which ran from November, 2013 to January, 2015 and amassed a staggering $232 million (£174.8 million) in ticket sales.
The film, which also features the 35-year-old singer’s 25-strong backing band, the Tennessee Kids, will have its world premiere at the Toronto International Film Festival, when the Can’t Stop The Feeling hitmaker is expected to appear alongside Demme to present the behind-the-scenes show to fans.
Demme previously opened up about the project while it was still in production last year, calling it “very emotional, very exciting”.
He added, “It’s a space age music film. There’s tremendous dancing in this piece. He’s got an extraordinary band called the Tennessee Kids. Huge horn section, two lead guitars, two drummers, eight dancers, four exquisite background singers. And we caught them on their last performance.” Demme, 72, was an obvious choice for the job, given his background in legendary concert films, which include the 2006 Neil Young documentary Heart of Gold, and Talking Heads’ famous 1984 film, Stop Making Sense.
He is also a seasoned Hollywood moviemaker, best known for 1991’s The Silence of the Lambs, for which he won the Best Director Oscar, and Philadelphia in 1993. Justin Timberlake and The Tennessee Kids will stream on Netflix from 12 October.
Timberlake, meanwhile, is preparing to star opposite Anna Kendrick and James Corden in his first Woody Allen film, an as-yet-untitled project reportedly set in New York City in the 1950s. He also voices a character named Branch in the upcoming animated film Trolls, to be released in November.
