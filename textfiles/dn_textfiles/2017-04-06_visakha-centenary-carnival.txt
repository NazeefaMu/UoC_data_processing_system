Visakha Centenary Carnival

Visakha Centenary Carnival 2017 organised by the Visakha Vidyalaya Old Girls' Association will be held on April 7 and 8 from 5 pm till midnight at Thurstan Cricket Grounds, Colombo 7.
All proceeds will be in aid of the primary school building project.
A special performance by Wayo will be held on April 7 while the Marians will perform on April 8.
Visakha Vidyalaya, Colombo marks its 100th anniversary this year with several programmes to be held throughout the year. The carnival, which is an upgrade of the annual Avurudu Pola, is the largest fund-raiser organized this year.
With wide patronage by the corporate sector, the carnival will include trade stalls ranging from clothes, pottery, services and other household items. Shoppers will have the opportunity to do their Avurudu shopping well in advance leaving more time for other Avurudu preparations. Children will also have ample opportunities to enjoy with special rides and other fun activities.
