Homemade Instant Glow Face Packs

Papaya Face Pack For Instant Glow
You Will Need
1/4 bowl papaya
1/2 teaspoon sandalwood powder
1/2 teaspoon aloe vera gel
Rose water
What You Have To Do
Mash the papaya. Add sandalwood powder and aloe vera gel to it. Mix well.
Add a few drops of rose water and mix everything to get a homogeneous mixture.
Apply this on your face and let it dry for about 20 minutes.
Wash your face clean with tap water.
 
How Often You Should Do This
Apply this face pack 2-3 times a week.
 
Why This Works
Papaya, which contains papain, can outdo the performance of even the best of brands when it comes to glowing skin. Papain structures its way through skin pores and offers the benefits of deep exfoliation. Sandalwood also works to remove dead skin from the epidermis and brightens up your complexion. This brings your fresh and glowing skin to the surface.
Banana Face Pack For Instant Glow
You Will Need
1/2 banana
1/2 teaspoon honey
1 teaspoon yogurt
Few drops of rose water
 
What You Have To Do
Mash the banana and add the other ingredients to it. Mix well.
Apply this on the face and let it dry naturally for about 15 minutes.
Rinse it off with lukewarm water.
How Often You Should Do This
Repeat this twice every week.
Why This Works
Banana and honey are rich sources of natural antioxidants that fight free radicals. Free radicals damage your skin cells and make the skin dry, dull, patchy, and wrinkled. Banana also moisturizes the skin and reduces wrinkles (7). The effects on the skin after 15 minutes are clearly noticeable from the first use itself.
Oatmeal Face Pack For Instant Glow
You Will Need
2 tablespoons oatmeal
1 teaspoon sandalwood powder
Rose water
What You Have To Do
To the oatmeal and sandalwood powder, add enough rose water to get a thick paste.
Apply this paste on the face.
Leave the face pack on for 15 minutes and then wash it off using upward scrubbing motions.
How Often You Should Do This
Do this twice a week.
Why This Works
Oats are the unsung heroes when it comes to skincare! Oatmeal forms the most natural scrub with the goodness of antioxidants and skin hydrating components. The end result is a cleansed face with glowing skin.
Tomato Face Pack For Instant Glow
You Will Need
1 small tomato
1 tablespoon sugar
What You Have To Do
Chop and mash the tomato. Add sugar to this and mix it well.
Apply this mixture on your face and neck.
Leave this on for 10 minutes.
Then, wet your fingertips and massage the face in upward strokes for a few minutes.
Now, rinse off the tomato face pack with cool water.
How Often You Should Do This
Use this as a face pack only every alternate day. Do not scrub your face more than two times in a week.
Why This Works
Tangy tomatoes, when used with right ingredients, add an instant glow to the skin. Sugar and tomato make a powerful spot correction and insta-glow face pack. The mild acids of tomato exfoliate the skin and also balance the skin’s pH (9). This brings out the true skin tone and glow in your skin. Sugar also helps in the exfoliation process with its coarse structure. Scrubbing boosts blood circulation to the facial skin resulting in radiant and flushed complexion.
Egg Face Pack For Instant Glow
You Will Need
1 egg white
1 tablespoon gram flour
Few drops of lemon juice
What You Have To Do
Beat the egg white well and then add the gram flour and lemon juice to it. Mix well.
Apply this carefully on your face and leave it on for 10-15 minutes or until it dries.
Rinse it off with lukewarm water first and then with cool water.
A teaspoon of honey can be added to the face pack to make it suitable for dry skin.
How Often You Should Do This
Apply this egg face pack 1-2 times a week.
Why This Works
Egg whites give your skin an instant lift and glow. They tighten the skin pores and tone the skin.
