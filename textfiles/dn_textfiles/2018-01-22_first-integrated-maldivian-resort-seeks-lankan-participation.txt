First integrated Maldivian resort seeks Lankan participation

Singha Estate PLC a leading Thai real estate developer launched Maldives’ first integrated resort, a travel destination mega project in Emboodhoo Lagoon, titled ‘Crossroads’ recently.
The Investment Retail Opportunity event is supported by the Maldivian government. This mega real estate project saw several international investors as well as international retail stores, including Sri Lankans attending the open house event for business and investment opportunities.
Situated just a 15-minute speedboat ride away from Velana International Airport (Malé International Airport) this Bill Bensley-designed ‘Township’ will bring together a rich combination of hotels, entertainment centres, retail stores and fine dining restaurants with unique offerings for both travellers and residents of Malé. “We are very keen on attracting investors from Sri Lanka, both those residing in Sri Lanka as well as expatriate Sri Lankans. The proximity between the two countries is definitely an attraction, while it is very much an investment which will keep increasing in value as the Maldives is one of the world’s leading up market tourist destinations, said Thiti Thongbenjamas, Chief Investment Officer, Singha Estate Company Limited. He also said the Crossroads development would present exciting new career opportunities for Sri Lankans who are known for their proficiency in the hospitality industry.
“We are focusing on business expansion and investment via land purchases in high-potential locations and quality project development under the “Best in Class” concept in tandem with investment, joint investments.”
Recent investments and business expansions have resulted in Singha Estate today commanding assets under the operation of the company itself, subsidiaries, and joint-venture companies in and outside of Thailand in three core areas, Commercial, residential and leisure /hotel properties. The company is investing in a rich portfolio of hospitality businesses that includes two high-end luxury resorts in Thailand and 29 hotels in the United Kingdom, giving them a combined total of over 3,000 rooms.
Crossroads is set to redefine the Maldives’ tourism experience and stimulate the country’s economy. The project is responding to the rapidly growing demand of the international family-leisure market, while embracing the “One Island, One Resort” concept.
