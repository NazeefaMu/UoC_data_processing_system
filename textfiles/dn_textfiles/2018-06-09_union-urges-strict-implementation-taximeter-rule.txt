Union urges strict implementation of taximeter rule

The All Island Three-Wheel Drivers’ Union had urged the government to make taximeters compulsory for all three-wheelers from June 20, to regulate the three-wheeler industry.
The All Island Three-Wheel Drivers’ Union President, Lalith Dharmasekara, addressing a media briefing held in Colombo yesterday, said this is the only way to make the three-wheeler industry a disciplined and safe public transport mode in the country.
“It was our union that first introduced taximeters, on January 5, 2005. Therefore, we are 100 percent in favour of making the taximeter compulsory for all three-wheelers. Those who opposed to taximeters previously still maintain the same stance, citing various reasons. But, these types of regulations are necessary to protect honour and dignity of the profession,” he added.
“Several gazette notifications making taximeters mandatory for all three-wheelers were issued in 2013 and 2017. But, no action was taken to implement the regulations. The government should at least make taximeters compulsory for all three-wheelers operating in the Western Province,” he added.
