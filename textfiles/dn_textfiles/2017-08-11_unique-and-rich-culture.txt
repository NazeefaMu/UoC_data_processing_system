Unique and rich in culture!

Divided we fall but united we stand. There are some leaders who are determined to spread discord and enmity. We can only resist them by our bonds of friendship and trust. The Daily News recently attended the Location Opening Ceremony of South Asia’s First Chinese Cultural Center. The new premises started operating from August 8 and this is a giant stride in the relations between our two countries. Two rich cultures meeting together.
The Chinese Cultural Center was established under the direction of President of People’s Republic of China, Xi Jinping, during his visit to Sri Lanka in September 2014.
Director of China Cultural Center Liwen Yue, called the event a moment of celebration and a historic milestones of the relations between the two countries. This journey was begun by the visit of President Xi Jinping during the presidency of President Mahinda Rajapaksa. Now the mission has been completed. The Center has its new premises. Now the best is yet to come.
“We have experienced quite a lot of challenges along the way. We have grown and learnt and this is a moment of respect and gratitude. We are thankful to all our friends for their friendship and support along the way. First I wish to convey our sincere gratitude to our Chinese Embassy and Ambassador Yi Xianliang and his capable and efficient staff. They have given us guidance, help and direction,” said Yue
The new center will be equipped with a library, classrooms for the purpose of conducting Chinese language programs and Chinese painting/craft lessons, an exhibition space to conduct painting/photography exhibitions. There will also be a kitchen with the facilities to conduct demonstrations and programs on authentic Chinese culinary art/style and a program assistance unit to help the students and academics to engage with the Chinese educational institutes for exchange programs.
This new center would not have been possible without the assistance provided by the Sri Lankan government, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Ministry of Culture, BMICH and BCIS and numerous others who helped a great deal. Yue also acknowledged the Media Coverage without which no one would know about the existence of the center.
China Cultural Center is a non- profit organization established by the Chinese Government. So far there are 30 overseas Chinese Cultural Centers. The one in Sri Lanka is the first overseas cultural center in South Asia. This China Cultural Center is dedicated to cultural relations between our two countries – professional art performance, Chinese language teaching, Chinese Martial Arts and Chinese cooking and many other aspects. It will also organize international seminars.
“We want to improve the mutual understanding and friendship of our two peoples. This will be a home and family to all who are interested in Chinese Culture. We hope that you, the Sri Lankans will be our frequent visitors, learning our language and read our books and watch our movies and just enjoy the aesthetic aspects. We will soon launch our website,” said Yue.
Deputy Minister of Internal Affairs, Wayamba Development and Cultural Affairs Palitha Thewarapperuma, pointed out the relations between Sri Lanka are China are truly old.
Fa-Hien was a celebrated 5th century Chinese Buddhist monk who visited Sri Lanka and spent much time in Sri Lanka. He returned to China and wrote a book on Sri Lanka. Our two countries have so much in common when you take into account our rich history. It is natural for such strong bonds to be forged.
“We Sri Lankans have a rich cultural history. Take Sigiriya for example. It is a marvel. Still no one has figured out its water management technology. We have a great history. However the state of affairs in our country at the present is upsetting. The Chinese are certainly an industrious nation who respect their natural environment. We can see by this how developed they are. Fa- Hien journeyed widely through Sri Lanka. From his visit to Sri Lanka we can see that we have always had ties with China dating back to the 5th century,” said Thewarapperuma.
Indeed Buddhism has also been part of these ties. After receiving independence from British Rule, the ties between Sri Lanka and China were further strengthened. In 1957, the two sides formally established the diplomatic relationship. Economic, Political and Cultural ties were formed. Such achievements are certainly praiseworthy.
The BMICH was built between 1970 and 1973. The convention center was a gift from the People's Republic of China in memory of S.W.R.D Bandaranaike. The BMICH has been a boon to Sri Lankan society and artistes. The cost it took to build the Nelum Pokuna was partly covered by China. This has been a huge help to our artistes.
Ambassador Yi Xianliang in his speech, spoke about the event as an exciting moment for him. The establishment of the cultural center between the two governments was an important decision. When it comes to ties between two countries culture is a very important part of the relationship.
“The decision to set up this cultural center was a landmark decision. The power of culture cannot be underestimated. Fa-Hien’s impact on the cultures of both our countries was touched upon by the Deputy Minister. Buddhism has had a significant influence on our relations. This cultural center is a family. Sri Lankans and Chinese alike. It is also open to anyone regardless of religion or race. It is a relationship. We should respect our differences and we should respect each other,” said Xianliang.
This year we celebrate 60 years of diplomatic ties between Sri Lanka and China. Xianliang pointed out that culture goes beyond boundaries. Culture has the power to promote friendship and cooperation. That is why cultural exchange between China and Sri Lanka is so important.
“We Chinese love peace. We want to further strengthen cultural exchange,” said Xianliang.
