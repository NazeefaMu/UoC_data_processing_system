Train strike called off temporarily

A strike scheduled from today midnight had been called off by the railway trade unions on the understanding that Transport and Civil Aviation Minister Arjuna Ranatunga would attend towards solving the issues relating to the railway salary anomalies within a month.
 
The President of the Train Controllers’ Association M.L.S. Ariyaratne said the Minister made this promise at a meeting with the railway trade unions held at the ministry auditorium. Considering the minister’s positive response, the trade union decided to temporarily call off the strike to facilitate the commuters during this festive season, Ariyaratne told the Daily News.
