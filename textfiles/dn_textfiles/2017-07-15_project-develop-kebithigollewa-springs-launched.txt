Project to develop Kebithigollewa springs launched

North Central Province (NCP) Chief Minister Peshala Jayaratne Bandara has launched a project to develop and preserve Kebithigollewa springs taking into account the value of them in providing clean drinking water for the area.
The programme was initiated recently by commissioning the development of the Gonameriyawa spring. A protective fence, storing tanks and a solar powered illumination system were installed under the programme.
The Kebithigollewa springs provide water to the people in the area, while tanks and wells dry up during even a short drought. Sinhaya, Udangawa, Dambagaha, Ambagahawewa, Dunuke and Kalawedi springs are some of them that continue to provide water for the people during droughts.
The water quality tests show that water of these fountains is 100 percent clean.
Kebithigollewa divisional secretary Chandana Anurudda Piyadasa said he has submitted a report on the importance of Kebithigollewa springs to the Anuradhapura Government Agent and the North Central Provincial Council for necessary action.
