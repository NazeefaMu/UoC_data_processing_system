Benefit-oriented approach to nutrition

According to a recent study, while a benefit-oriented approach to nutrition increases college students’ willingness to consume fruits and vegetables, the availability and cost of healthy food on campus are critical to changing their eating habits.
As part of the study, researchers surveyed 175 college students, assessing their willingness to change their diet to include more fruits and vegetables. Participants were asked to weigh pros like improved energy, meal variety and weight control against perceived disadvantages like being hungry, having less energy and not enjoying meals.
Once convinced that more fruits and vegetables would benefit them, students noted that other changes were needed in this area to help them consume fruits better. These included adding vending machines that sell produce, increasing the variety of fruits offered and improving the taste and variety of cafeteria meal choices. Most importantly, students said produce needs to be more affordable.
Manoj Sharma, lead researcher on this study said, “Between 90 and 95 percent of adults in the U.S. do not consume the recommended amount of fruits and vegetables. This basic nutritional deficiency is tied to a myriad health problems, so it is important to address it early.”
According to the survey, sustaining a diet with the recommended amount of fruits and vegetables requires an emotional shift, in which students decide to eat healthy even when they are stressed or feeling low. Respondents also said keeping a diary or utilizing an app that helped track eating habits would help monitor their consumption and rectify their diet if they face difficulties. Finally, enlisting the support of family and friends appeared crucial to sustainment.
Vinayak K. Nahar, co-author of this study said, “Once we can entice students to add more fruits and vegetables into their diets and create conditions that make it possible, we have to then focus making those changes permanent.”
The findings appeared in The Journal of the American Osteopathic Association. ANI
