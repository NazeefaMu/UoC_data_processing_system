Cake mixing celebration at Lavinia Bakers

Christmas is no fun without the traditional Christmas cake. The cake-mixing ceremony, it dates back to 17th century in Europe. Hotels have been known to organize cake-mixing ceremonies to spread the warmth of the festive season. Lavinia Bakers had their Christmas cake mixing ceremony recently. Lavinia Bakers have established as one of the finest delicatessen shop and restaurant in Battaramulla and suburbs.
The ingredients of the festive fruit cake were mixed with wine and liquor in advance so that the ingredients can develop aroma and taste. The ingredients mostly comprise dry fruits like raisins, black currants, prunes, glazed dates, cherries, candid orange, lemon rinds and nuts like cashews, pistachios and almonds. The best part is pouring in the liquor. Fresh juices and honey are also generously added along with freshly ground spices are also added and tossed till the fruits and nuts are well coated. This is emptied into large containers and stored for a couple of days before Christmas, with occasional stirring to ensure that the nuts soak till they are swollen. This was a fun filled event and was attended by the staff and Chefs of Lavinia Bakers.
