OGILVY PR WINS GLOBAL BULLDOG PR AWARD

Ogilvy Public Relations Sri Lanka won a coveted Bulldog Award at the Bulldog PR Awards 2018, which recognised outstanding PR and communications campaigns from 2017.
The Agency’s ‘Uncover the Truth’ campaign for Transparency International Sri Lanka (TISL) topped the ‘Campaign on a Shoestring Budget’ category winning the Gold Award, in a competition that saw a record number of entries from around the world.
The Bulldog PR Awards is organised by The Bulldog Reporter, considered a leader in media intelligence - supplying news, analysis and high-level training content to public relations and corporate communications professionals. It is the only PR-focused award programme solely judged by a collective of senior international journalists.
The globally-recognised campaign for TISL, focused on educating the Sri Lankan public on the Right to Information Act, which came into effect on February 4, 2017, after nearly two decades awaiting parliamentary sign-off. The PR campaign was executed in partnership with the Neth FM radio station and its online channels, to promote the Act’s usage among Sri Lankans.
Speaking on the win, Irvin Weerackody, Chairman, Ogilvy Group Sri Lanka, said: “This is the fourth international accolade received by the ‘Uncover the Truth’ campaign. Winning the Gold Bulldog PR Award in a competition that is 100% PR-focused and judged by an esteemed panel of senior journalists is affirmation of the campaign’s thinking, the results it has achieved and the role PR plays in matters of national interest.”
In 2017, Ogilvy Public Relations became the first and only PR Agency in the country to win the Platinum ‘Best-in-Show’ Award at the SABRE APC Awards. The campaign went on to win Gold in the Global SABRE Awards 2017 and was ranked as the 6th best PR campaign in the world, by The Holmes Report.
