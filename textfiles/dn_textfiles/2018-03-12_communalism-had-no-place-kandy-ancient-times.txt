Communalism had no place in Kandy since ancient times

Since ancient times, communalism or racism had no place in the Kandy district or even the central hills for that matter, since the Sinhalese, Tamil and Muslim communities had always lived in unity and harmony.
This had been the strongest foundation for unity and peace, as shown in previous election results. The Sinhalese living in Kadugannawa, Galagedara and Akurana electorates had joined hands with their Muslim and Tamil brethren to elect Muslim members as their parliamentary representatives at the general elections. The Sinhalese joined hands with Muslims in this manner as they valued humanism and human values over racism and religionism.
After 1970, the two-member Akurana seat was renamed the Harispattuwa electorate, with a majority of Sinhalese people. A Muslim individual named A. C. Shahul Hameed was elected as the first member of the two-member Harispattuwa electorate at consecutive elections from 1970 to 2000, since a majority of the Sinhalese too, rallied around this renowned leader of the Muslim Community, to repeatedly send him to Parliament.
A. C. S. Hameed was never communal-minded, as he looked at society with humanism. The Buddhist temple was a common place to him as much as the Mosque or the Hindu Kovil was.
He patronised all of them with equal enthusiasm. A. C. S. Hameed was instrumental in building a fully-equipped Seemamalakaya at Waratenna, Haloluwa, near the Mahaweli Ganga and gifting it to the Maha Sangha for the Udarata Amarapura Nikaya to perform its Higher ordination; the (Upasampada) Vinayakarma ceremony.
Sinhalese Buddhists always remember with gratitude, the services rendered by such leaders to forge communal amity.
It was through such services that communal and religious unity could be forged, rather than through legal means. People ought to realise that it was through the path laid by Buddhist, Islam, Hindu and Christian leaders and clergy that we could strive for peace and prosperity.
Everyone should unite and join hands in the spirit of brotherhood for the sake of unity amongst Sinhala, Tamil, Muslim and Burgher communities. That would be the best tribute we could pay to past leaders such as A. C. Shahul Hameed.
