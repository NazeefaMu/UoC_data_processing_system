Ceylinco Insurance PLC moved up the corporate ladder to the 7th position, reinforcing its dominance as an outstanding performer in the corporate sector according to Business Today Top 30 rankings for the year 2018.
Once again, Ceylinco Insurance earned the honour of being the only Insurance Company amongst the top 30 companies for the year 2017/2018. Sri Lanka’s top 30 companies were feted at a ceremony held at the Shangri-La Hotel in Colombo recently.
The occasion marked the sixth consecutive year that Ceylinco Insurance came out ahead in the insurance arena in the island, achieving a truly unique feat.
Ajith Gunawardena, Managing Director / Chief Executive Officer of Ceylinco Insurance PLC accepted the award from President Maithripala Sirisena. He was accompanied by Patrick Alwis and Thushara Ranasingha, Directors of Ceylinco Insurance PLC. A distinguished gathering of corporate leaders representing a diverse spectrum of businesses and religious leaders were also present on the occasion.
Business Today Top 30 is based on published information of companies listed in the Colombo Stock Exchange. The companies are selected on the basis of their performance during the financial year ending December 31, 2017 and March 31, 2018. Announcing the Top 30 Companies in Sri Lanka, the November 2018 issue of the Business Today magazine commented, “We Congratulate the Business Today Top 30 - 2017/18 for their steady excellent performance. It is our hope that as the Sri Lankan economy continues to grow amidst challenges, that they too will embrace the opportunities and of course, face the competition as true giants.”
Ajith Gunawardena, Managing Director / Chief Executive Officer, addressing the gathering said, “I would like to express my gratitude to our loyal customers for placing their trust and belief in us through the most difficult times. It is their loyalty and confidence that motivates us to reach higher, as we make every effort to serve them beyond their expectations. Similarly, I thank each and every one of our employees, who I consider members of our large family, for their dedication, commitment, courage and professionalism that ensures we deliver an exceptional service. They always do their utmost to live by our promise, overcoming all obstacles, especially in instances such as On The Spot Claim settlements, which is considered a world’s first. I wish to dedicate this recognition to our valued customers, our staff and my fellow directors for enabling us to reach another milestone in our dynamic journey.”
