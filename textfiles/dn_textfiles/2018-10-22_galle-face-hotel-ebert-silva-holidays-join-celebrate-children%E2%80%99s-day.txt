GALLE FACE HOTEL, EBERT SILVA HOLIDAYS JOIN TO CELEBRATE CHILDREN’S DAY

The Galle Face Hotel with Ebert Silva Holidays, Sri Lanka’s pioneering travel and tourism company partnered to celebrate World Children’s Day and bring joy and happiness to 100 under-privileged local children.
This year’s celebration invited 50 children from The School for the Deaf in Ratmalana and 50 kids from Madduma Bandara Vidyalaya School in Kandy for a entertaining day of sightseeing and activities in Colombo courtesy of Ebert Silva Holidays, plus food, special treats and games at the luxurious Galle Face Hotel.
Robert C. Hauck, General Manager and Area Vice President of the Galle Face Hotel, commented; “The Galle Face Hotel regularly engages in CSR activities that benefit local communities, so we were thrilled to join hands with Ebert Silva Holidays once again to host the World Children’s Day activities. By interacting with the children during the day, it is clear that activities such as these have the ability to make a positive difference, bringing renewed hope and joy into young lives.”
Rajini de Silva Mendis, Chairperson of Ebert Silva Holidays, added that Ebert Silva Holidays was delighted to partner this worthwhile CSR initiative. “Once again we gave these children a most splendid, fun-filled day out. The Children’s Day is the highlight of our CSR calendar.. We, as responsible entities, have joined hands to convey the love and care the society has for the children with the sincere wish of seeing them become responsible citizens.”
The 50 children from Madduma Bandara Vidyalaya School arrived by train from Kandy to Colombo’s Fort Railway Station. For many of them it was their first time visiting Sri Lanka’s capital city.
Upon arrival they were met by Ebert Silva Holidays and welcomed onboard brightly decorated open-top double-decker buses, which took them to the Galle Face Hotel.
They were joined by the children from The School for the Deaf in Ratmalana.
The city tour ended at the Port of Colombo, where the children were shown around the new developments of the port and harbour, courtesy of the Sri Lanka Ports Authority.
The highlight of the day was still to come however, as the children were transported to Bandaranaike International Airport for a private tour of a SriLankan Airlines Airbus A330 aircraft, courtesy of SriLankan Airlines Engineering.
