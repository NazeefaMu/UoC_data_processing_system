Companies must heed  to voices of Chief  Information Officers

Sri Lankan companies must give a better hearing to the voices of Chief Information Officers (CIO) in today’s tech focused, competitive business environment where the flow of information is essential for business success, said Dr Sanjiva Weerawarana, Founder, Chairman and Chief Architect of WSO2.
He was speaking at the second edition of Future of Business - Innovation in Action’, conference, held at the Gall Face hotel Colombo, yesterday.
The modern CIO is a key figure to transform the way companies do business. “In many developed countries CIOs are at the forefront of implementing innovative solutions to create value for all stakeholders.”Adopting disruptive technologies and generating a culture of innovation in Sri Lanka’s corporate entities could spur entrepreneurship, making their customers, employees and overall ecosystem happier, Weerawarana said.
“Technology is changing at a faster pace whether you like it or not.”
He said that innovation means thinking of new ways to do old things better or do entirely new things. “Corporate entities need to come up with solutions that are inherent, practical in a bid to make a meaningful impact on all stakeholders.”
