Kalutara North Public Cemetery neglected

The Kalutara North Public Cemetery is currently overrun by wild plants as it had been neglected by the relevant authorities, residents said.
Most cremations in the area are carried out at the Pothupitiya Public Cemetery and hence, the Kaltuara North Cemetery is not used that often by the people, they said, adding that anyone deserves an honourable burial, but at the said cemetery, that would not be possible.
The Kalutara Pradeshiya Sabha should take responsibility for the current state of the cemetery, residents said.
