Unqualified SAITM students creating obstacles - Alwis

SAITM students have been absorbed by the Kotelawala Defence University (KDU) but 34 students who did not possess the required basic qualifications to study medicine could not gain entrance.
But, the first, second and third batches of SAITM students have not entered the KDU due to certain reasons, Media Spokesman of the Parents Union of the State Medical Students Wasantha Alwis said.
Addressing the media in Colombo yesterday, he said the three student batches have refrained from joining the KDU because they are unable to sit and pass the examination required for this purpose after clinical training. The second reason is that they do not possess the minimum qualifications to enter the KDU.
According to Alwis, SAITM students who do not have even three simple passes (3 S) at the G.C.E.Advanced Level Examination in the Science Stream are now trying to prevent those qualified SAITM students in their group from entering the KDU and obtaining a medical degree. Therefore, the parents of these qualified students should come forward against this injustice.
“Recently,the media reported that 83 SAITM students had the Sri Lanka Medical Council to register them as doctors, but only a few SAITM students had come on that day.
The SAITM is an illegal fraudulent institution and this fact had been proved on several occasions during the past. Now, it is up to the authorities to end the issue in keeping with the KDU Act,” Alwis added.
