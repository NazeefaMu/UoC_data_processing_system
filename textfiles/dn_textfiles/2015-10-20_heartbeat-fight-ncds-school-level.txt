'Heartbeat' to fight NCDs at school level

The 'Heartbeat' walk will commence from Green Path, Colombo on October 24 at 7.30 a.m. with the participation of President Maithripala Sirisena and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe, Media and Parliament Reform Minister Gayantha Karunatilleke said.
Addressing the media at the Government Information Department Auditorium, Colombo yesterday he said that he will take part in the walk with Health, Nutrition and Indigenous Medicine Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne, Education Minister Akila Viraj Kariyawasam and many others. The walk which begins from opposite the Nelum Pokuna, has been organised to educate school children on preventing rapidly increasing Non Communicable Diseases (NCDs) and promote healthy living.
According to Minister Karunatilleke, four main facts will be highlighted at the programme and they are: the importance of drinking clean water, importance of eating nutritious food, avoiding unhealthy food and avoiding tobacco and alcohol.
The programme organised by the UNESCO section of Royal Collage, Colombo, has been accepted by all schools in the Colombo Educational Zone and assisted by the Health, Nutrition and Indigenous Medicine Ministry, World Health Organization, UNESCO, UNICEF and NATA.
Minister Karunatilleke said the funds allocated for free health and education will be further increased from the next budget and it will surpass the allocations made by the previous government.
Sri Lanka has controlled communicable diseases similar to developed countries but NCDs are rapidly increasing. Children are also becoming victims of NCDs. Over 15 percent of school children in Colombo city are overweight.
This is a very timely programme organised to save our future generation from NCDs and make them healthy, he said.
