Rs. 50 mn for Kataragama sacred city

Megapolis and Western Development Minister Patali Champika Ranawaka said Rs.50 billion has been allocated for the development of Kataragama sacred city.
He said the present regime inaugurated a mammoth development plan that was never inaugurated by any previous regime for the sylvan shrine area of Kataragama.
The minister was addressing the gathering at the Sella Kataragama sylvan shrine after inspecting work on the construction of the resting place and park.
He said that shops and retail outlets scattered all over Kataragama in a haphazard manner will be relocated under one roof according to a plan mooted by the Urban Development Authority. The Vedasitikanda sylvan shrine area also will be developed along with Kataragama sacred city. The chairman and opposition leader of the Kataragama PS have joined hands to make these development programmes a success.
The minister said that poverty exists in alarming proportions in the Moneragala district. As such, they have to focus their attention on that district. He said that Menik Ganga is a river of great importance and steps would be taken to stop the pollution around the river. The crocodiles in the river would be relocated to prevent devotees from attacks. Minister Ranjith Maddum Bandara was also present on the occasion.
