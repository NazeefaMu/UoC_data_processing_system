Shashikala Siriwardene the  queen of Sri Lanka cricket

Shashikala Siriwardene started to play cricket at the age of six at Kotikawatte, a suburb of Colombo in Sri Lanka. She had the unstinted support of her father even at that tender age and with that guidance she has never looked back. She was only a slip of lass, but packed into her tiny frame it was evident that she had loads of guts, coupled with determination and dedication which enabled her to reach stardom thus far. The sudden success she gained by leading Sri Lanka with distinction at the Women’s World Cup in 2013, has not changed her life style by even an iota. She is still humble and down to earth and this she states was due to her upbringing based on good moral values inculcated into her from her early days.
Sri Lankan women cricketers stamped their authority in their vastly improved World Cup campaign 2013, where they surprised defending champions England and throttled India down the relegation path from the Super Six. To cap it all Sri Lanka also had the better of the much fancied South Africa to capture the number 5 slot then.
She also gives a word of thanks to Gwen Herath, who was a live wire behind women’s cricket from the very inception.
At the time I interviewed Shashikala, the Sri Lankan women’s cricket team was an unknown quantity. The names like Shashikala Siriwardene and Kaushalya became household names overnight not only in Sri Lanka, but also in countries like England and India. All this ‘Ha Ho” came about, when our lissome lassies beat the English and the Indian women cricketers in the Women’s World Cup 2013; they entered the Super Six Stages of the tournament.
The Sri Lankan team beat the World Cup title holders England by the skin of their teeth in the last ball of the match and then went on to beat India as easy as a walk in the park, this victory was by a handsome margin of 138 runs in the 43rd over, with 7 overs to spare. Those who were fortunate enough to witness these matches on our famous cricket channel were in for pure unadulterated entertainment at its very best.
Whilst Shashikala’s then aspirations to succeed at the highest level should be admired, it is interesting to note the present Sri Lankan team’s dismal performance in South Africa.
In my opinion the void left by Mahela Jayawardene and Kumar Sangakkara will take some time to fill but all is not lost since we have two promising young batsmen whose technical inadequacies should be sorted out and together with the right exposure, they should go a long way.
Dhananjaya de Silva if he can reduce his back lift and get used to the change of pace could go far; he shows class when he drives with his head still. Kusal Mendis the pocket rocket should be persevered with in all formats as well. He unfortunately gets exposed to the moving ball outside the off stump time and again.
Lahiru Kumara is another find who could form a devastating combination with Dushmantha Chameera if he gets his rhythm back. The future does not look too bad for Sri Lanka if the fitness levels of the players could be sustained!
It is interesting to note that a friend of mine G.C. from U.K. had to say about the present happenings in the Test arena, he goes on “May I share with you one of my views on our SL Test Cricketers: Generally, only a handful of them have been blessed with that special combination - “Talent” with a “Cricketing-Brain”. I believe, to become a top quality international player today, one needs this combination. Among the recent SL players, Mahela, Sangakkara, Murali and Vass were good examples of this fact. They had the skill to gauge the opposition during a match and make quick adjustments to counter the challenges presented by the opposition, most of the time quite successfully.
“When watching the current SL team in action, in South Africa, it was obvious, although some of the SL players have good talent, they appear to lack awareness of what the opposition team was getting up to, and therefore were unable to make necessary adjustments (e.g. to their style of playing) to deal with the challenges in the matches whilst batting, bowling and fielding.
The difference between the two teams could be described simply as SL being ‘Amateur’ or non Professional.
Today, with so much electronic information available about players and teams in all sports, to compete successfully consistently and particularly against quality opposition like the SA cricket team, one need to have the above combination in abundance, I feel.
All our present players are desperately in need of quality professional help and encouragement to develop this skill - “how to THINK in cricket during the game”, concludes my friend in UK.
