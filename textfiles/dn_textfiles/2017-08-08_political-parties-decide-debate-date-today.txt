Political parties to decide debate date today

Leaders of political parties in Parliament would decide today the date for taking up the no-confidence motion debate against Foreign Minister Ravi Karunanayake.
Speaker of Parliament Karu Jayasuriya accepted the no-confidence motion last week against Former Finance Minister and Present Foreign Affairs Minister Ravi Karunanayake submitted by the Joint Opposition (JO) over his alleged involvement in the Central Bank Bond Scams in February 2015 to March 2016.
Thirty seven members of the JO reportedly signed the petition. The JO comprises about 52 members elected on the UPFA ticket at the August 2015 parliamentary polls.
