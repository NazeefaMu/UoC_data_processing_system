'National assets should not be sold to foreign companies'

Addressing a meeting convened by the Joint Opposition at the Tangalle Town Hall auditorium last morning, MP Dullas Alahapperuma said, “It is our duty to protect our land and national assets from being sold or given on 99-year leases to foreign companies and safeguard them for our future generations.”
“The Portuguese who came to this country in 1515 only requested for a land area which could be cordoned off by a cow’s skin. What did they do? They shred the cow’s skin and enclosed the Colombo Fort with it. Afterwards, the Portuguese and Dutch invaded our country and later on, the English. It was only after 433 years that we were able to gain our freedom again. Under the agreements signed by the present government, it will be only in 2116 that we can even discuss the future of the Hambantota port and Mattala airport,” he added.
Members of Parliament Bandula Gunawardena, Wimal Weerawana, Johnston Fernando and a few others addressed the meeting which was attended by approximately a thousand supporters of the Joint Opposition including members of provincial councils and former members of local government institutions.
Later, the participants protested opposite the Tangalle bus stand for almost an hour without incident before dispersing.
