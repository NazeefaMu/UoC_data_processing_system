Khan spins Afghanistan to big win in first Bangladesh T20

DEHRADUN, India, Sunday - Teen sensation Rashid Khan led an inspired spin attack to help Afghanistan trounce Bangladesh by 45 runs in the first Twenty20 international on Sunday.
Khan claimed three wickets with his wily leg-spin to help bowl out Bangladesh for 122 as hosts Afghanistan took a 1-0 lead in the three-match series in the northern Indian city of Dehradun.
Off-spinner Mujeeb Ur Rahman struck with the first ball of the innings to trap Tamim Iqbal lbw for nought.
Fellow spinner Mohammad Nabi soon joined in to claim the two crucial wickets of Liton Das, for 30, and Shakib Al Hasan, for 15, as Bangladesh were reduced to 3-64.
The 19-year-old Khan then broke Bangladesh's back with two successive strikes in his very first over to derail the chase.
