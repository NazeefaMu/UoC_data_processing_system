External sector strengthens, export earnings rise

Sri Lanka’s external sector strengthened with significant inflows to the financial account of the balance of payments (BOP) with proceeds from the 11th international sovereign bond (ISB) issuance and a syndicated loan facility in May 2017.
These inflows resulted in an increase in gross official reserves from US dollars 5 billion as at end April 2017 to US dollars 6.8 billion as at end May 2017. Investor confidence in the Sri Lankan economy continued to be buoyant with continuous inflows to the government securities market and the Colombo Stock Exchange (CSE).
However, the current account of the BOP demonstrated a mixed performance during May with a widening of the trade deficit and a moderation in earnings from tourism and workers’ remittances. Despite exports increasing for the third consecutive month, the higher increase in import expenditure resulted in a further expansion of the trade deficit. Overall, continuous inflows to the financial account with positive investor sentiments and a gradual rebalancing of the current account is expected to positively impact Sri Lanka’s external sector during the second half of 2017. Continuing the year-on-year increasing trend observed since March 2017, earnings from exports expanded for the third consecutive month in May 2017. Accordingly, export earnings increased by 7.8 per cent to US dollars 841 million in May 2017 compared to US dollars 780 million recorded in the corresponding month of the previous year.
The largest contribution for this increase was from agricultural exports followed by industrial exports. Earnings from agricultural exports at US dollars 223 million increased by 32 per cent (year-on-year) in May 2017 due to higher exports of all agricultural goods except coconut kernel products.
Export earnings from tea grew by 45.9 per cent (year-on-year) to US dollars 132 million owing to both higher prices and increased volumes.
Reflecting high tea prices in the international market, the average export price of tea increased to US dollars 5.41 per kg in May 2017 in comparison to US dollars 4.24 per kg in May 2016.
Earnings from seafood exports increased by 40.5 per cent (year-on-year) to US dollars 18 million in May 2017 benefitting from the removal of the ban on exports of fisheries products to the EU market.
On a cumulative basis, earnings from exports grew by 4.3 per cent (year-on-year) to US dollars 4,410 million during the first five months of 2017.
Expenditure on imports increased to US dollars 1,727 million in May 2017 registering a 8.6 per cent (year-on-year) growth, reflecting higher demand for consumer goods and investment goods imports.
Expenditure on consumer goods imports increased by 17.5 per cent (year-on-year) to US dollars 386 million in May 2017, mainly driven by higher imports of food and beverages particularly sugar and rice.
On a cumulative basis, import expenditure at US dollars 8,610 million during the first five months of 2017 increased by 12.6 per cent (year-on-year) largely due to higher imports of fuel, rice and gold.
The deficit in the trade balance widened to US dollars 886 million in May 2017 compared to US dollars 810 million in May 2016.
The cumulative trade deficit during the first five months of 2017 increased to US dollars 4,200 million from US dollars 3,415 million in the corresponding period of 2016.
In May 2017, tourist arrivals recorded a decline of 2.5 per cent, year-on-year, with 121,891 tourists arriving during the month.
The overall BOP is estimated to have recorded a surplus of US dollars 1,586.6 million during the first five months of 2017 in comparison to a deficit of US dollars 1,142.4 million recorded during the corresponding period of 2016.
Sri Lanka’s gross official reserves increased to US dollars 6.8 billion by end May 2017 with the proceeds from the ISB issuance and the syndicated loan facility.
The gross official reserves were equivalent to 4.0 months of imports, while total foreign assets at US dollars 8.9 billion were equivalent to 5.2 months of imports.
