Ten percent bonus for Thriposha employees

Health Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne paid a 10 percent bonus to all employees in the Thriposha Company, recently. The company made a net profit of Rs. 103 million last year, a Health Ministry spokesperson said.
According to the spokesperson, the company provided Rs. 200 million to the Treasury last year. There are 40 sales agents island-wide who sell the additional production of Thriposha called ‘Suposha’.
Before paying bonuses to the employees, Minister Senaratne opened the new machinery worth Rs. 100 million installed with the aim of transferring the entire Thriposha production mechanism to machines. Earlier, 75 percent of the Thriposha production was handled with machines while the rest of the 25 percent was handled with human labour, he said.
Addressing the gathering, Minister Senaratne stated that a net profit of Rs. 2,900 million was made by the State Engineering Corporation when he was the Cabinet Minister in charge of the institution. However, the Cabinet Minister who took over after him spent the profit in six months. Now the State Pharmaceuticals Corporation (SPC) makes profits and as a result, the SPC employees’ salaries increased by 50 percent, he said.
