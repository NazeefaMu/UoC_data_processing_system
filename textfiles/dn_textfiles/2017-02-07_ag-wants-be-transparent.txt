AG wants to be transparent

Auditor General Gamini Wijesinghe said he is committed to stand by the principles of good governance on which the ‘Yahapalana’ government was formed.
Wijesinghe said as the Auditor General of a country where good governance thrives, he is compelled to execute his duties to the utmost, delivering transparency and accountability.
He questioned as to how he should help achieve good governance if he is supposed to keep secrets from the public.
“One of the basic principles of good governance is transparency. I will have to speak up openly and overtly. If the Auditor General has to function in secrecy what good governance would there be?” he questioned.
Wijesinghe pointed out that when it comes to matters regarding public property, he has no power to keep any matter under wraps and not be accountable to the public.
He also pointed out that with the recent implementation of the Right to Information Act, the public was entitled to have access to information to which he cannot do otherwise.
“The public might sue me if they suspect that I suppress important information. I can in no way hide any information from the public,” the Auditor General said.
He said he got the Auditor General’s Department website upgraded to upload all audit reports to it, soon after sending them out to respective institutes, for the public to access.
“As the Auditor General, I am not ready to write ‘secret-letters’ to fulfill other people’s whims and fancies. I will execute my duties while securing the sensitive aspects of the public administration,” he said.
Wijesinghe said the judiciary is also making an effort on promoting accountability and transparency.
He said the public is starving for justice and accurate information.
“The public will only be able to come to a conclusion on certain issues, only if they are privy to multidimensional observations and impartial information, ” the Auditor General pointed out.
Speaking on issuing of surcharge certificates, Wijesinghe said under new amendments to the Audit Act, the Auditor General’s powers of surcharge will be extended. Audit surcharge is a statutory remedy available to safeguard the property of the institution subject to audit. In practice, it serves to recover the loss sustained by the Local Authority or university from the persons responsible for such loss.
The Auditor General of Sri Lanka does not possess power of surcharge in respect of government departments, ministries, public corporations and Provincial Councils.
“With the new changes, even if a minister discards a surcharge certificate issued by an Auditor General, the Audit Commission can probe into the matter if necessary. So no one indicted will be able to get away with what they have done using political favours,” Wijesinghe said.
The Auditor General said issuing a surcharge certificate precedes much inspection, discussion and audit queries.
