A brand new collection of sapphires from Tiesh

Tiesh jewellers recently unveiled an impressive array of trend setting designs from its brand new collection of sapphires for the forthcoming festive season, at an exclusive gala soirée at the Tiesh store in Colombo.
Gracing the champagne soirée was Miss Inter Continental Sri Lanka 2017 Natalee Fernando in her first official public appearance after winning the title. Tiesh created the crown for the winner and was also the Official Jewellery Partner of the Miss Continental Sri Lanka pageant.
Designed and created by the master craftsmen at Tiesh, the Rs. 1.2 million hand-crafted rose gold crown weighs 212 grams and is studded with blue topazes and white sapphires.
The multi-hued sapphires, ranging from the perennially favoured blues, sun-kissed yellows, the pretty pinks and more, are meticulously hand-crafted and artfully placed on precious metal, thus producing the most exquisitely designed selection of jewellery coveted by all who value the good things in life.
Speaking about the elaborate designs, Tiesh, Directors, Ayesh and Thiyasha De Fonseka remarked, “This is a collection of statement pieces which are perfect for cocktails or evening functions. Using a new range of cuts and styles in fashioning the gemstones we have gained ground in the ever-evolving fashion trends of Milan and Paris.”
“While the main focus in the collection is centered on the versatile sapphires, we also showcase other Sri Lankan gemstones and the timeless value of diamonds which always lives up to its reputation as being a girl’s best friend. By setting these stones in precious metals of rose gold, white gold, yellow gold and silver, we have further enhanced their original value many fold,” they added.
The Directors went on to say that Tiesh uses Sri Lankan gemstones as much as possible. “Since we have such a vast range of beautiful, naturally-coloured and textured gemstones we can boast of. The collection comprises beautiful necklaces, earrings, pendants and rings, with a focus on the larger pieces designed primarily for events and cocktails.”
