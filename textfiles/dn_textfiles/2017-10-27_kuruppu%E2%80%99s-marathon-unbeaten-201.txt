KURUPPU’S marathon unbeaten 201

He was the first to score a century on debut and follow it up with the first double hundred. He was DON SARDHA BRENDON PRIYANTHA KURUPPU,a classy cricketing star to emerge and shine in the Lankan cricketing firmament as a wicket keeper/batsman and enter his name in the record books.
As a youngster taking to the game very early in his cricketing career at Ananda College he showed immense potential as a competent right hand opening batsman and capped it by being a stylish and safe wicket keeper.
As a right hand batsman he was stylish, always in line before executing and had the supreme elegance and was a treat to watch when he began to unwind his repertoire of strokes all-round the wicket. He had the ideal technique and temperament for an opening batsman.
Responsibility
On opening batsmen falls the responsibility to see the side to a formidable start so that the batsmen following will have the right platform to launch out and see the team to a formidable score. In the four Test matches he played he put on show this essential requirement.
It was pity that KURUPPU did not have the opportunity of playing more Test cricket than the four Tests he played. Yet in those four Test matches he excelled he had the fortune of playing in more Test matches would have gone to leave an indelible mark.
KURUPPU was born on January 5, 1962 and had his education at Ananda College where in addition to his studies, he showed immense potential as a promising opening batsman and wicket keeper and when he scored heavily in school cricket and later for Bloomfield C & AC and Burgher Recreation Club, national honours were not long in coming.
Memorable outing
And when that great day dawned what a memorable outing he made debuting against New Zealand at the CCC Ground facing the pace and swing of that great Kiwi all-rounder RICHARD HADLEE who was later knighted for his astonishing performances for country and the English county he played for Nottinghamshire.
Hadlee was one of the best all-rounders of that era. He had a lovely run up and even lovelier action and with a little leap at the wicket he delivered express speed and had the ability to move the ball both ways and cap it all with a vicious bouncer and to survive his blitz was an achievement.
That Kiwi attack had another fine mover of the ball in Ewan Chatfield. His accuracy was his hall mark. And they also had a vicious left arm spinner in Stephen Bock. KURUPPU faced all their wiles in compiling his unbeaten double ton – 201
Amazing powers
KURUPPU showed remarkable and amazing powers of concentration in batting for 777 minutes and facing 548 balls which was also a world record. When he scored the double ton as a wicket keeper batsman on debut, he also became the third to do so in Test cricket history. The other batsmen who had performed this feat earlier were R.E. Foster and Lawrence Rowe.
That was the Test match that had to be abandoned before going the full distance because the terrorists exploded a bomb near the Pettah Bus Stand and most of the Kiwi cricketers who were shaken by the explosion urged the management to send them back pronto.
It was a travesty of justice that he played Four Tests and 54 one day internationals. He played in the 1983 World Cup in England and in one of the games he made 72 against Pakistan. In the historic victory against New Zealand he made a fluent 62 that helped Sri Lanka beat New Zealand.
Match winning knock
I covered that tour for the ‘Daily Mirror’ and the ‘Times of Ceylon’ and in the company of Sports Minister of that time Vincent Perera watched him make that match winning knock. On hanging up his boots KURUPPU served as selector, manager of the national team and in many other positions.
He also had a stint in Maldives as their coach. He was the son of Stanley Kuruppu who was an outstanding cricket promoter and umpire.
