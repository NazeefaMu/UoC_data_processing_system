Reimbursement programme to enable heart surgeries to be done at private hospitals

The Government will shortly introduce a reimbursement programme to enable heart patients get their surgeries done at private hospitals, Parliamentary Reforms and Lands Minister Gayantha Karunathilake said.
The minister was addressing the media at Sirikotha UNP Headquarters yesterday.
“With this move, heart patients will no longer be required to wait in the waiting lists of government hospitals. They can get their surgeries done in private hospitals and the Government will pay for it,” he said.
The Government early this month also announced a drastic price reduction of heart stents. Accordingly, the maximum retail price of a bare metal stent has been fixed at Rs.24,000 and the maximum price of a drug-eluting stent has been fixed at Rs.105,000.
Stents are provided free of charge for heart patients who undergo surgeries in state hospitals.
