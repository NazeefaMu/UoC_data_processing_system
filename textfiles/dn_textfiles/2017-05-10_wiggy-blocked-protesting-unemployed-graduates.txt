Wiggy blocked by protesting unemployed graduates

Northern Province Chief Minister C. V. Wigneswaran was prevented from attending the Northern Provincial Council (NPC) session by a group of protesting unemployed graduates yesterday. Wigneswaran, along with several other Councillors, had to return without attending the sessions as the unemployed graduates had blocked both entrance gates to the NPC. The graduates have been protesting in front of the NPC for the last two months demanding jobs.
Wigneswaran’s plea that he be allowed to enter had been refused by the angry graduates, sources from Jaffna said.
The Chief Minister had said that he will intervene to solve the graduate’s issues shortly but the graduates had been adamant claiming that for two long months their requests have fallen on deaf ears.
The 92nd NPC council session was scheduled to be held today.
