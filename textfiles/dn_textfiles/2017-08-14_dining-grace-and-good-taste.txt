Dining with grace and good taste!

I’ve noticed a several shameless diners openly belch, talk with their mouths full and pick food from their teeth during meal times. I’ve seen people with atrocious table manners shovel food into their mouths reminding one of feeding time at the zoo.
I have watched quite a few diners talking with their mouths full, belching and burping while attacking their fodder and wolfing it down in the most disgusting manner imaginable.
‘Finger food’
Table manners play an important part in making a favourable impression. They are visible signals of the state of our manners and therefore are essential to professional success. The point of etiquette rules is to make you feel comfortable.
Whether dining with royalty, heads of state, the diplomatic corps or sitting with friends and family at a humble home repast, an understanding of dining protocol makes time spent with others around a table more enjoyable. When you know the rules there is no awkwardness or questions about how things should be done.
Instead there is only opportunity to spend quality time with the company present. I have often noticed that many of the so-called elite, or people regarded as the cream of society had never been taught proper dining etiquette. I was actually astounded that people who had spent fortunes on their education were still gobbling from their plates like horses.

Yes, some of us do have horrendously poor table manners. We slurp our soup, chomp our chocolate cake, spill our salt and belch our blessings. And while all of this slurping, chomping, spilling and belching can be seen as quaintly charming, we are no longer living in caves or little wooden shacks. You must learn about basic table manners you should use at every meal.
It may have been frowned upon for decades but eating with your hands in a restaurant is now acceptable, etiquette experts say – so long as you do not lick your fingers clean afterwards. Even then there are guidelines to modern dining manners designed to help people navigate the potentially messy minefield of ‘finger food.’
Sure, we Sri Lankan ‘buth gottas’ relish out staple rice and curry above most other menus. For us sub-continentals there is no way around it. Our food tastes best when eaten with the fingers. There is a perceptible dimension added to the eating process when we do it the customary way. Besides, Sri Lankan foods are designed to be eaten by hand.
Even breads are to be torn and wrapped around foods. Rice is customarily blended with curries so each mouthful is unique. If you eat off a banana leaf trying to use a knife and fork would shred your ‘plate.’
Paying attention
Eating gracefully with your fingers is a cultural practice everyone should experience while visiting Sri Lanka. For those who might feel finicky many Sri Lankan hosts provide esoteric table items such as fingerbowls. Frankly, many Westerners almost never use those things, and even when they do, will not know how to use them either.
I remember at a large formal rice and curry luncheon where finger bowls had been placed for every diner. One of the foreign guests tried to drink it mistaking it for a kind of exotic aperitif.
If nothing else, live by these simple rules which I was tutored in when I was around six. First always pay attention to your hosts. Being an observant diner and picking up on cues from your host will enable you to avoid most of the embarrassing situations you could find yourself in.
Simple things like waiting to eat until you see others eating and using the utensils others are using will enable you to ‘wing it,’ meaning to do it in an impromptu manner, improvising, with little preparation. However, this constant observing and following does not allow you to relax and enjoy the evening. So you had better become a fast learner from simple observation so that you can dine with the confidence and finesse of an aristocrat.
To start, your napkin should be spread out on your lap, never tucked into the neck of your shirt even if you want to protect your Gianni Versace tie. Sit up straight and make sure your elbows are not encroaching on your neighbour’s space. Do not rest your elbows on the table or lean on them when eating. If you are served a meal that is already on the plate, wait until everyone round the table has been served before starting.
Cutlery should be rested on the plate or bowl between bites. Never gesture with your cutlery, and do not scrape or clatter it noisily. Depending on the formality of the occasion, there will be varying amounts of cutlery on the table. The layout should always be the same, fork to the left, knives and spoons to the right. Work from the outside inwards, course by course. Dessert utensils usually sit above the place setting.
Awkward situations
Always eat at a relaxed pace and try to match your fellow diners. Keep your mouth closed and chewing noise to a minimum. Never smack your chops. Talking while there is food in your mouth should be avoided at all costs even when you have a conversational gem ready to pop out of your gullet. Do not drink your wine too fast or ask for a top-up unless you are in very familiar company. Do not over-indulge, there is nothing worse than a drunken diner, particularly at a formal or business dinner.
In order to recover if expected to speak, only put a single bite in your mouth at a time. The days of stuffing your mouth and with as much food as it can hold and wolfing it down are over.
Bring your food to your face, not your face to your food. You should not be leaning over your food, shovelling it into your mouth with a distance travelled of only six inches. Instead, sit straight, balance a single bite on the utensil of choice and bring it directly to your mouth.
Dress appropriately even for informal dining and make certain your attire even though relaxed and casual is clean. In both social and professional circles, demonstrating class and courtesy can open doors for you, while displaying poor manners can cause doors to shut in your face.
It only takes a bit of guidance and practice to help people sail through a wide variety of potentially awkward situations while dining with grace and poise. Moving from being clueless in such matters and becoming a class act is not a impossibility if you simply follow the right guidelines. Bon apetit!
