Do cats actually like being hugged?

Do cats even like being hugged? Will they just put up with it to please us lonely humans? When we hug our cats in a loving embrace, do they secretly resent us?
The idea that our cats may not even like a cuddle is a little heartbreaking, so we chatted to an expert to find out the facts.
Anita Kelsey is a cat behaviourist with a degree in feline psychology, so she knows her stuff.
Anita tells Metro.co.uk that all cats are different, and that some will like hugs while others won’t – so no, there’s no definitive declaration that cats hate hugs and we shouldn’t be clutching them to our chests.
“Some like physical contact and others hate the feeling of entrapment and not being in control,’ says Anita.
“There’s a high percentage of cats that do not like being picked up and we are learning it is more common than we thought.”
Her advice is to assess your cat’s behaviour, read their signals, and don’t force a hug with your cat if they don’t seem into it.
“A cat that doesn’t like being held or picked up will struggle to get away or hiss to tell you it is not happy,’ Anita tells us. ‘One could even get a nip to say “put me down”. Other signs are the body going stiff and feeling tense until the cat is put down again.”
Hissing, scratching, or wriggling out of your grasp are all pretty obvious signals that the cat you’re hugging doesn’t want to be hugged at the moment. Don’t ignore those signs – put the cat down.
Signs a cat does like being hugged: They’re purring, they’re nestling in closer, and if you stop the cuddles they’ll tap you with their paw.
