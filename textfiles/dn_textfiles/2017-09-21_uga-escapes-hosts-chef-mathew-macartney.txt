Uga Escapes hosts Chef Mathew Macartney

Colombo’s Residence by Uga Escapes hosted a curated wine dinner at their acclaimed restaurant, Rare with Chef Mathew Macartney. Guests were treated to a variety of dishes packed with flavour and an array of colours, to sample with a side of complementing wine.
Some of the wines included in the menu were Italian Prosecco, Chilean Sauvignon Blanc, South African Rosé and Argentinian Viognier.The dishes were works of art as much as they were culinary marvels, with the likes of Shiso Cured Canadian Wild Salmon with Kohlrabi, Oysters, Passionfruit and Roasted Sesame, Spiced Caramel Glazed Pork Belly with Celeriac Remoulade and Honey Crisp Apples, Roasted Salt Grass Lamb with Crisp Mint Hollandaise, Boulanger Potato and Organic Vegetables, and to round it off, Rose Geranium Gelato.
‘The team at Residence worked together with me to create a menu for the evening with both international experiences and local inspirations,’ Chef Mathew Macartney said.
Chef Macartney himself first got his start as an apprentice at Café Cuccinain South Yarra which specialises in Italian cuisine. Macartney was actively involved in a range of culinary events, working hand-in-hand with industry leaders. Over the years, Macartney travelled the world, including countries such as Fiji, New Zealand and Dubai. Following many awards and accolades, Macartney recently opened Char Dining in the leafy suburb of Balwyn, Melbourne, Australia. The aim is to offer a convenient, high quality suburban bistro for culinary enthusiasts to hop into whenever they feel like it.
Macartney’s next big project is slated for 2017, where he will be overseeing the kitchens at the newly redeveloped Village Belle Hotel in beautiful Saint Kilda. The hotel which is scheduled to open later this year is set to be a vision, encased in a double-storey glass winter garden and complete with an open kitchen.
