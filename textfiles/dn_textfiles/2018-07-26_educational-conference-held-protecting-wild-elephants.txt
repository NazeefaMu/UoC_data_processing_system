Educational conference held on protecting wild elephants

An educational conference on protecting wild elephants in both Kurunegala and Puttalam Districts of the NWP was held on July 25 at Bingiriya Youth Training Centre, Kurunegala for the school community of the Kurunegala District.
Senior Divisional Secretary of Kurunegala District W. E. Jayathilake speaking at the conference said, “The Department of Wildlife Conservation has decided to conduct a survey on wild elephant population countrywide. Accordingly, this proposed survey would be held from September 23 to 25, 2018. Accordingly, all tourist bungalows attached to the department would be closed during these three days.
Jayathilake said, “In 2011, a survey on wild elephants in Sri Lanka was held. That survey revealed that there were 5,878 wild elephants in our forests at that time.
However, many wild elephants have died due to human–elephant conflict after that survey in 2011 and about 79 wild elephants have died of different reasons during the past five months of this year”.
