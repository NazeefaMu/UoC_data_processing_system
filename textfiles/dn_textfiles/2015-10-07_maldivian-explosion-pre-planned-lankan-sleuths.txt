Maldivian explosion pre-planned - Lankan sleuths

The four Sri Lankan detectives who investigated the Maldives speed boat explosion had found that the incident was pre-planned.
The Lankan detectives team arrived in the Maldives on October 1 to investigate an explosion which occurred in the Maldivian President Yameen Abdul Gayoom's speedboat on September 28. It was not happened due to any technical failure in the boat's engine, as claimed previously. The Sri Lankan investigative team comprising the Government Analyst, an STF bomb squad officer and two CID officers were in the Maldives to assist in the investigations on the explosion. The team returned to the Island on Monday.
According to the sources the explosive device had been planted in the VIP cabin of the boat, under the helmsman's seat and the Maldivian government had been conveyed this information verbally.
"We think this is not an assassination bid but a mere warning to President Gayoom. The final report of this investigation had been handed over to the Sri Lankan government on Tuesday for onward transmission to the Maldivian Government," the sources said.
According to the reports only the Sri Lankan team had completed the investigations on the incident though the officers of the FBI, Indian and Saudi Arabian sleuths have involved in the investigations to the explosion, the sources added.
