Acne bacteria trigger pimples

Acne is one of the most common skin problems around the world, with youth suffering its impacts the most.
The most common causes of acne is the result of hair follicles becoming clogged with oil and dead skin cells or the excess activity of a particular type of hormone.This results in acne erupting usually on the face, forehead, chest, upper back and shoulders.
Research however shows that apart from the above factors, bacteria too can affect the breakout of acne. Certain bacteria called Propionobacterium acnes that live on our skin cause pimples.
P. acnes consume sebum as its food source and secrete substances to break it down. These secretions irritate surrounding tissue, resulting in a quick response from the immune system,an inflammation or pimple. Latest findings however show that not all acne bacteria trigger pimples and that some actually help maintain healthy skin.Thus through the use of creams or lotions which increase the concentration of friendly P. acnes, one can reduce the severity of acne.
