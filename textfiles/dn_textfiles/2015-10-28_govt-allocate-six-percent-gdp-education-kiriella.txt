Govt to allocate six percent of GDP for education - Kiriella

The prsent government would increase the funding for education by four fold during the next year, University Education and Highways Minister Lakshman Kiriella said.
The best gift that could be given to children is education. We will also increase university education funding by hundred percent next year. It is only through the knowledge of children that we could serve the country," he said.
"The government intends to provide special preference to education. We will allocate six percent of the GDP for education as already promised," he added.
Minister Kiriella said so addressing the parents and teachers at the annual prize giving of Buddhist Ladies College in Colombo.
He further said that there is more unity among Indians, because they have an understanding of the various languages used in the different states. We went backward because we failed to learn each others languages despite there being only two native languages. This led to mistrust among the communities, breaking down the friendship and finally to the war,' he added.
Out of 1400 million Indians, 500 millions have a very good knowledge of English. Even at this late stage, many schools have realized the need to teach English. Buddhist Ladies College render yeoman service in this regard to their students. We love our native languages, but we need a command of English to deal with the wider world," he added.
