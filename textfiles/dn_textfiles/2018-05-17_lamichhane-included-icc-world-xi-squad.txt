Spotted by former Nepal coach Pubudu Dassanayake
Lamichhane included in ICC World XI squad

Nepal wrist-spinner Sandeep Lamichhane was on Wednesday added to the ICC World XI squad for the May 31 T20I against the West Indies.
The match will be played at Lord’s and all the proceeds will be used to redevelop the stadia in the Caribbean which were damaged due to hurricanes last year.
Lamichhane, 17, will join a star-studded line-up, which also comprises Eoin Morgan (captain), Shahid Afridi, Tamim Iqbal, Dinesh Karthik, Rashid Khan, Mitchell McClenaghan, Shoaib Malik, Hardik Pandya, Thisara Perera and Luke Ronchi against the ICC World Twenty20 champion side, which includes the likes of Samuel Badree, Carlos Brathwaite, Chris Gayle, Evin Lewis, Marlon Samuels and Andre Russell.
Lamichhane was spotted by then Nepal coach Pubudu Dassanayake in 2014 and first represented Nepal in the ICC Under19 Cricket World Cup 2016 in which he took 16 wickets.
Lamichhane became the first Nepal player to be picked in the IPL 2018 auction when he was signed up by Delhi Daredevils.
Meanwhile, Bangladesh star Shakib Al Hasan has withdrawn from the match due to personal reasons and his replacement will be announced soon.
