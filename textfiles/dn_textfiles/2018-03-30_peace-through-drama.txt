Peace through drama

The Workshop Players are a group of thespians that deliver powerful and exceptional performances. They are a theatre outfit that have conquered the stage. Recently the workshop players celebrated World Theatre Day at the British Council. To celebrate this day the Workshop Players delivered performances based from Excerpts from Les Miserables, Lion King and Antony and Cleopatra.
Workshop players Andre Howson (Antony) and Piorina Fernando (Cleopatra) delivered an absolutely professional, dynamic and classy performance of Antony and Cleopatra that involved exchanges between the Roman Military Commander Mark Antony and the charismatic Cleopatra. The passion and the intensity was brought out well by the extremely talented duo that did justice to the World Theatre Day.
Artistic Director of Workshop Players Jerome De Silva, a larger than life personality in Sri Lankan theatre, was seen overlooking the entire evening as his thespians made him proud by their superb acting.
The Workshop Players, one of Sri Lanka’s foremost English theatre groups, is famed for bringing some of the best of Broadway musicals such as ‘Oliver!’, ‘The Sound of Music’, ‘Evita’, ‘The Phantom of the Opera’, ‘Les Miserables’ and most recently the highly acclaimed ‘My Fair Lady’ to the local stage. This non-profit organization made up of theatre lovers, aims to promote talent in all aspects of theatre while also using it as a vehicle to promote peace.
Founded on March 7, 1992, over the past 26 years hundreds of children, adolescents and adults from different theatre and personal backgrounds have been part of the WSP family. The WSP also have dedicated groups for Sinhala theatre productions and junior theatre productions.
The group functions under the philosophy of ‘theatre with a purpose’, and has tried to share their learning with young people from less privileged backgrounds and run workshops for theatre students in Colombo, Wadduwa, Alawwa, Batticaloa, Jaffna and Trincomalee.
The troupe is made-up of directors, actors, singers, dancers, musicians, choreographers, writers, composers, artists, designers, sound engineers, lighting designers and engineers, stage managers and backstage and front of house (FoH) crew. Several ‘Workshoppers’ have gone on to successfully establish their own theatre companies while many of the troupe are also frequently found handling lights, sound and stage management for other companies.
Since its maiden production in January 1993, The Workshop Players have staged 16 plays in English and three in Sinhala, from musicals to straight plays, foreign to local plays and historical epics to contemporary fiction.
Artistic Director of Workshop Players Jerome De Silva, said that as Thespians World Theatre Day is their day. “I am part of the Tower Hall Theatre Foundation and is the International Theatre Institute (ITI) center for Sri Lanka. When I went to the World Theatre conference last year, we discussed a lot of things and we felt that we were not doing enough in this country to warrant ITI membership. So I came back and dedicated the work of the Workshop players towards furthering that and bolstering the ITI center here at Tower Hall Theatre Foundation. World Theatre day is a big thing all over the world. Last year we celebrated it by doing Shakespeare in the Park. So it is good that we can involve people. If you take the situation in the world, theatre can cross all borders. So we are fighting for artists’ mobility. We have a voice in the United Nations. I am trying to make the Workshop Players an associate member of ITI,” explained De Silva.
De Silva’s message to people is to join hands with the theatre.
“Let’s go out and spread this message and make theatre accessible to everybody. And that is exactly what we are doing here. We are doing Antony and Cleopatra on April 7 and 8. We want to make World Theatre Day officially known to people, otherwise The Tower Hall does it only in the confines of the Tower Hall Theatre Foundation and no one knows. We have a voice in the United Nations. With all the walls that are being built, border walls and immigration problems and shutting out immigrants. Workshop Players is probably the biggest and the most active theatre group in the country, having crossed all borders, all nationalities with no racial issues and is the ideal group to take the message of World Theatre message of peace. It is great if we get associate membership,” pointed out De Silva.
President Anoj Wijayaratne, pointed out that World Theatre Day in Sri Lanka is something that is largely unheard of. “I think us partnering up with the British Council is definitely an important initiative when it comes to spreading the message out, saying that there is a World Theatre Day that exists. Because in Sri Lanka theatre is developing on a huge scale, in English and Sinhala. So in the plays done today, Hamlet was performed by the Tower Hall Theatre Foundation who we invited to come along and perform, and Les Miserables, Lion King and Antony and Cleopatra were done by the Workshop Players,” said Wijayaratne.
Wijayaratne, started out with the Workshop Players with Jesus Christ Superstar, and then did Phantom of the Opera and Les Miserables and My Fair Lady. “For me Jesus Christ Superstar was the most memorable for me and I had a really great experience with the cast,” said Wijayaratne.
Workshop Player Emmanuel Eze, is Nigerian who came to Sri Lanka in 2015, to study Electronic engineering and entered the workshop players by auditioning for ‘My Fair Lady’.
“At first I thought theatre was lame, but it turned out to be one of the most amazing experiences in my life. And I found a second family. I love all of them and I would definitely advise anyone to take part in theatre at least once because it is a great experience. It is surprising how people from different walks in life can come together in unison and love each other because of their shared interest in drama. You get to spend time with each other and form a bond that is going to be there for a life time. This is one awesome family that I do not want to let go of,” said Eze.
Praneeth Chanaka, is a close associate of Jerome De Silva who says that the workshop players are extremely resourceful and that they have great discipline.
“At the Workshop Players you can learn a lot and it has nothing to do with money. You learn something of intrinsic value at Workshop Players. This applies to both English and Sinhala dramas. Working with Jerome and the workshop players opens up so many avenues for English and Sinhala thespian,” said Chanaka.
Reihan Stevens has been part of the Workshop players since 2013. “We are doing stuff from Shakespeare to Lion King and to Les Miserables. We are using this day as a vessel to promote the upcoming production of Antony and Cleopatra which is happening at Vihara Maha Devi open air theatre which is of the Shakespeare in the park initiative. This has grown by leaps and bounds. So it is basically spreading the word of theatre. So Sri Lanka has tremendous potential when it comes to theatre. What is great about the workshop players is that it has become a family for me. It is an outlet to express who I am and I love being on stage. I have done Jesus Christ Superstar, Phantom of the Opera and Les Miserables and My Fair Lady.
I have done Bengal Bungalow with Jehan Aloysius and Peter Pan. It is a great experience being with the Workshop Players. You gain amazing friends,” said Stevens.
Piorina Fernando felt that it certainly is a privilege to play the role of Cleopatra in what can be regarded as one of Shakespeare’s great tragedies – Antony and Cleopatra. “I really embraced this opportunity when they were casting. I really love the productions the workshop players do. In school I did a lot of drama. I have a passion for drama that you can’t really put into words. I have enjoyed the process thoroughly. Drama has given me a lot of confidence and brought me out of my shell. You learn so much and your character is built and you become part of a family,” she said.
Mayanthi De Silva, who has been in the Workshop Players since 2014,described drama as a life choice. “It is great that Sri Lanka has a drama culture and we have drama available and a lot of people don’t realize how educational it is and what change it can do. It is a vehicle of change. It is important to understand that you have to keep the aesthetic part of you alive, because that is what will keep you happy and keep you grounded,” said De Silva.
Dramatist Andre Howson who played the character of Caesar’s General Mark Antony said that theatre is a wonderful way of showing the human condition. “You are able to bring out emotion and stories that people can relate to. We study the mood and the emotion and the intention behind the words and try and bring that out. You try to be as authentic as possible. Drama has made me more aware of how people think. It has given me greater control over how I speak and behave and made me more confident. Antony and Cleopatra is one of the biggest plays you can ever do in Shakespeare. There is so much story in this and so much passion,” said Howson.
