Faith unmoved

The fountain of compassion, the supreme enlightened one blesses the humanity with the outcome of his intellectual struggle – the greatest truth that ever occurred in human history two months after his enlightenment on Esala full moon day he delivered his first sermon to the five ascetics in Deer Part at Isipathana Benares and set in motion the wheel of Dhamma. The priceless Dhamma was brought into focus. The gift Dhamma excels all other gifts “Sabha Danam Dhamma Danam Jinathi,” so said Sakyamuni Gautama the all wise, all compassionate universal teacher displaying the distinctive noble message. He advised him, numerous disciples, to spread the doctrine and the message of the Dhamma to all mankind in the whole world. When the monsoon breaks, however, it was not possible for them to engage in the samsaric tour.
Vassana
The Sakyamuni Gautama advised them to stay indoors this period is called vas meaning rain. Esala poya marks the beginning of the vas season when Bhikkhus had been advised to stay in their own temples without going for alms. It is said that the first vassana was observed by the Buddha and his five disciples at Isipatana Migadaye in Benares. This traditionally accepted vas retreat coming down from Buddha time is continued to date by the most revered Sangha with great piety and the Nikini Poya remains very important.
Vassana remains honoured for those devout Buddhists who await the dawn of if to engage in religious activities and gain merit. This is the time that the meritorious heart of the true Buddhist is best with love and compassion. This is the time that both clergies as well as the laity engage in Dana, Seela, Bhavana the three fold activities of true Buddhists while at the same time giving up Loba, Dwesha and Moha.
Profound faith
They invite the Maha Sangha to observe Vas with Vas Aradhana Pinkama since that time, till it culminates in Katina pooja and the laity look after them to the best of their ability. It is the responsibility of the Dayaka Sabha to look after the Sangha attending to all their needs complying with their requests. They see to the comfort of the sangha with great care making offerings and paying them respect in every way. The devotees visit the temple daily for religious activities such as Mal Pooja and Bodhi pooja in the evening and listen to the sermons delivered by the sangha. They engage in acts of guiding Upasaka Upasikas in Dhamma path helping them in religious rituals and the true Buddhists, in turn, provide the Bhikkhus with four essentials in the life of a Bhikkhu namely, Cheevara Pindapatha Senasana Gilanaprathya (robes alms, shelter and medical case), the most merit bestowing religious act of theirs. The practice of observing vassana continues to this day as the fulfilment of a disciplinary requirement as laid down by the Buddha. Hence vassana creates a special religious awakening among the Buddhists making a great impact on their moral lives.
Sangayana
Among the other events, the most historic and the most sacred event was the first convention or the first Dhamma Sangayana to preserve the supreme gift of Dhamma in its pristine purity in the land of its birth – Jambudweepa. This was undertaken by his third disciple Arahat Maha Kashyapa which was held at Saptapanni cave entrance located in the foot hills of Himalaya. Ven. Ananda supposed to be the treasurer of Dhamma, the very person who should have been leading the event was unable to participate due to his failure to attain Arahantship. However, with a determined effort, it was achieved on the Nikini Fullmoon day, paving the way for his to make the most intellectual contribution to the Sangayana. It was a landmark gift to the upkeep of the Buddha Sasana.
