Errant traders in Akkaraipattu warned

Health Department Officials inspected hotels, eateries, fruitstalls, and trade centres in the Akkaraipattu Municipality areas and issued warnings to several errant traders recently. They were warned to follow proper safety measures and asked to destroy rotten fruits and outdated food items in their trading locations.
The PHIs said owners of the unclean hotels in Akkaraippattu were charged. They warned hotel owners not to send waste water to road drains since it will create ideal breeding grounds for mosquitoes.
PHIs attached to the Akkaraipattu MOH participated.
