Peradeniya Economics Research Symposium held

The sixth Peradeniya International Economics Research Symposium (PIERS) – 2018 was held on November 8 and 9 at the Postgraduate Institute of Humanities and Social Sciences (PGIHS), Peradeniya University. The event was jointly organised by the Department of Economics and Statistics of the Peradeniya University and the Faculty of Economics, South Asian University, India with collaborative support from the Faculty of Economic Sciences & Business Administration, Transilvania University of Brasov, Romania.
The Department of Economics and Statistics, the pioneer institution in Economics education and research in the country, organised the Peradeniya Economics Research Symposium (PERS) in 2013, as an opportunity to bring together academics, researchers, policy makers, public officials and students in the field of Economics to share their research findings and learn from interaction with each other. Since then, this Symposium has continued as an annual event whilst growing in stature and participation. In 2017, the Symposium widened its doors to include greater foreign participation and thus became known as the ‘Peradeniya International Economics Research Symposium (PIERS)’.
The theme of the conference was “Towards equitable, inclusive and sustainable development within the globalised economy”.
The keynote address on “The role of foreign direct investment for economic development: Evidence from Central and Eastern Europe” was delivered by Prof. Nicolae Marinescu, Faculty of Economic Sciences and Business Administration, Transilvania University of Brasov, Romania.
Prof. Upul B. Dissanayake, Vice Chancellor, University of Peradeniya was the Chief Guest. Prof. Santosh C. Panda (Vice-President and Dean, Faculty of Economics, South Asian University, India), Prof. O.G. Dayaratna Banda (Dean, Faculty of Arts, University of Peradeniya) and Prof. Monica Raileanu Szeles (General Manager, Research & Development Institute, Transilvania University of Brasov, Romania) graced the occasion as guests of honour.
The symposium began with a panel discussion featuring local and international speakers engaging with each other on the topic of “South Asian Economic development”. Technical sessions featured 30 research papers distributed across nine themes. The symposium closed with an invited speech on “The Fallacy of the Sri Lankan open economy” by Prof. Sirimal Abeyratne, Colombo University.
Prof. Anoma Abhayaratne was the Chairperson and S. Rajendran was the coordinator of the organising committee of PIERS 2018. The Head, Department of Economics & Statistics S. Vijesandiran served in an advisory capacity.
