Stage set for Techno Sri Lanka – 2018 in October at BMICH

Techno Sri Lanka – 2018, the country’s premier National Engineering and Technology Engineering and Technology Exhibition, the annual flagship event of the Institution of Engineers, Sri Lanka for the year 2018 to be held on 12th, 13th and 14th October 2018 at the BMICH, was officially launched recently.
Held for the 33rd consecutive year, the exhibition is well known for bringing the latest in technologies, products, skills and best practices from around the world to its target audience during the 3 days it’s held, while maintaining optimum standards.The appropriate and timely theme for this year’s Techno is “Engineering the Green Future”.
The “Green Future” concept adds new dimensions to traditional ideas of comfortable livelihood and has gained momentum as a fast emerging, wide spectrum game changer, making everyday life more affordable to benefit of a wider global population for sustainable living, without compromising the existence of future generations. It encompasses sustainable practices for improving environmental quality with the aim to conservatively harness existing resources to create vibrant, resilient and socially responsible communities.
Green future products, services and practices allow for economic development while conserving for future generations by integrating social, environment by incorporating ‘Green’ principles in to planning, design and execution of engineering.
As an event organized by apex body for the engineering profession in the country, IESL, Techno Sri Lanka 2018 would be an ideal platform for visitors to experience the latest products and services using latest green future compliant technologies from all over the world on display under one roof.
Techno Sri Lanka hold its reputation high for being the exhibition, which causes the most direct influence of introducing cutting edge technology from the global arena to the development of the country. As Sri Lanka is on the lookout for ways and means to fast track its development, the government sector needs active support of the private enterprises to benchmark performance and create healthy competition.
Techno Sri Lanka is an ideal setting by being a common platform for both exposing and promoting the latest engineering and technologies of the industry among engineers involved in the development of the country, whether in public or private sectors.
Sri Lanka as member of a responsible world community is compelled to comply with global standards, making it imperative that we follow sustainable methods. Going forward, the market will demand for products that are manufactured in an environment-friendly manner, complying with strict quality standards, with highest regard for health and safety of humans as well as flora and fauna.
Progressively, the market will analyze product material all the way down to their source to ensure that the sustainability guidelines are met.
Techno Sri Lanka has established itself as the prime exhibition in Sri Lanka to demonstrate the ability to champion this cause and Techno displays demonstrate environment-friendly manufacturing processes that produces a range of innovative products which contribute towards energy efficiency.
Techno Sri Lanka 2018 with Engineering the Green Future, as its theme, takes a significant step forward, encouraging smart, clean and green solutions, to the country, which our indigenous ways always had, but lost during the colonial period.
IESL encourages all stakeholders to participate in this exhibition and make the best use of this opportunity for their respective spheres of activity, be it as suppliers, agents, national policy makers, engineers, consumers, etc. towards achieving green future compliant national development.
