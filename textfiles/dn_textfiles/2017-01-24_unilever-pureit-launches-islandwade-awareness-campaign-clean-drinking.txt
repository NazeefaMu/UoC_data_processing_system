Unilever Pureit  launches islandwade awareness campaign  on clean drinking water

Unilever Pureit launched the ‘Simple Water Challenge.’ This cleverly engaging activation began with a focus on thought provokingly educating the public about existing misconceptions around clean drinking water.
Conducted at the World Trade Centre Lobby, passers-by were presented with two seemingly identical glasses of clear water and requested to select the safe drinking water option from the two glasses. This was met with an array of responses and reactions.
“When I was asked to select the clean drinking water glass, I realised I have always assumed that clear water equates clean drinking water.Now I’m thinking about water more seriously,” said Neel Indika Balasooriya who stopped to participate in the activation and took on the ‘Simple Water Challenge’.
Clean water is accepted as an intricate element of human health, well-being and broader eco-life. Despite this, there is a tendency to make decisions about cleanliness of water on subjective values like colour, odour (or lack of) and taste.
This launch was aimed at confronting the simple way we think about water to help people realize, Water is not as simple as we think.
The awareness campaign drew an enthusiastic response from the participants who were hitherto unaware of many of the sanitation and safety aspects of clean drinking water that were shared with them following the challenge.
This 2017, Unilever Pureit Sri Lanka launches into an island-wide campaign to raise public awareness about clean drinking water.
The ‘Simple Water Challenge’ continued to key Lankan cities such as Kandy City Centre January 22 and Kurunegala on January 28 is carried out by Pureit, a water purification system by Unilever (Pvt) Limited.
Pureit is a point-of-use and in-home water treatment system and uses water purification technology that reduces harmful bacteria and parasites, which exists in drinking water.
Pureit is available in 14 countries and was a result of extensive research and development undertaken by Unilever to ensure clean and safe drinking water around the world through affordable means.
