To make way for Kelani Valley expansion
Railway squatters to get houses

About 1,600 unauthorised settlers will be given houses in railway lands to facilitate Kelani Valley railway line development, Transport and Civil Aviation Minister Nimal Siripala de Silva said.
The minister made this observation following an inspection tour along the Kelani Valley railway line on November 29.
The minister said the development of the Kelani Valley railway line is an urgent need but its development is hampered due to unauthorised settlements on either side of the rail track.
"Therefore as a solution to this problem we have decided to identify 1,600 families living on either side along the track and relocate them in 1,600 houses built on four different plots of railway land without resorting to forcible eviction of the unauthorised settlers," de Silva said. The Railway officials who accompanied the minister said plans have already been finalised for the relocation exercise. The minister said the 2016 Budget has allocated Rs. 1,500 million to develop the Kelani Valley Railway.
That allocation would be used to develop and raise the platforms of 11 main railway stations and 10 sub stations to suit the trains deployed along the line.
Since this work had to be accomplished without any delay the Railway Department should obtain private sector support for the job by calling tenders if it did not possess the facilities and human resources needed for the job. He also said emphasis should also be given to build a dual track by eradicating bends to facilitate greater speed.
He said at present trains on this track proceeded at a speed of 15 to 40 kmph and three hours to complete a 60 km journey from Colombo Fort to Avissawella. Ministry Secretary Nihal Somaweera and GMR Vijaya Amaratunga were also present.
