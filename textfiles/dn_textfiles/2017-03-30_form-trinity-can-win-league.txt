In form Trinity can win league

The inter-school first round league rugby tournament for 2017 is coming to an end. Trinity College Kandy has finished their first round with resounding success having won all the matches played. If Trinity continues to play in this fashion they should have no problem in winning the schools league title. School’s rugger today, particularly in Kandy is the number one glamour sport. Its popularity is shown by the large crowds at matches.
It is also significant that rugby crowds have been swelling with great interest, but the rugby organization for the schools controlling body has left much to be desired. Today out of the Kandy schools only one or two schools are backed with much needed facilities, most of the schools are lacking the basic facilities and are severely handicapped and lack what they need. Some schools lack good trained MIC’s who know the game. Some of them don’t even know the names of their players. To play a game, a school needs over Rs. 50,000 as ground charges together with other expenses it comes to over Rs. 85,000.
TRINTIY COLLEGE: Led by Nathan Yee and coached by Lote Raikabula, who is assisted by Buddika Abeyasinghe playing in Division I Segment 2A opened the season beating Wesley and continued their winning streak by beating Science, Zahira, S. Thomas’ and Prince of Wales. Now they are waiting for the second round peak in performance. Their key game the Bradby Shield against Royal will be the 73rd, and the first leg is scheduled for 20 May in Kandy. The second leg on 3 June is in Colombo. Trinity has a wealth of talent in their forwards and their back division too comprises some exciting players. Whatever the secret of their success, rugger has always been the most popular game at Trinity College since it was first introduced in 1906.
VIDYARTHA COLLEGE: Led by Sachintha Kaluarachchi and coached by one of the most qualified coaches Anil Jayasinghe are with three wins in three outings against Ananda, Maliyadeva and St. Sylvester’s. Their last game is with Kingswood College. It has been postponed a few times and still the new date has not been fixed. They have a good side, but their weakness is in their back division. They are playing in the Division I segment 2B. Vidyartha is a school which earned a name in the field of rugby. The game was introduced to the school chiefly due to the initiative of Old Trinitians. It was Kandy Sports Club who helped them to find their feet at rugby by permitting them to use of their grounds at Nittawela free of charge, and also channeling their knowledgeable players to coach the Vidyartha boys.
St. ANTHONY’S COLLEGE: Led by Dinuk Amarasinghe and coached by Nihal Viper Gunaratne and assisted by Nalaka Weerakkody have won only one game against D.S. Senanayake and lost to St. Joseph’s, Isipathana and St Peter’s. Their next game is on 1 April with Dharmaraja and on 8 April with Royal. St. Anthony’s is a school which has reached great heights in the field of rugby, after coming into the game in the late 1950’s. They have come a long way in the game. They have the potential to perform better, but there is some ‘hoodoo’ which seems to be prevailing over them. It is time they settled down to some solid rugby to repeat their past glory. They play in Division 1 Segment 1A.
ST. SYLVESTER’S COLLEGE: Led by Kelum Rajapakse and coached by Aruna Rankothge from whom a lot was expected in the first round have failed to oblige. They have managed to win only one game against St. John’s and lost to Vidyartha, Kingswood and Maliyadeva. Their next game is on 1 April with Ananda. A school which started rugby in the mid 1950’s and had to give up and restart in the 1980’s sad to say their performances have been very disappointing. The school together with the OBA need to study the actual reason for the team’s poor performance and find avenues to provide the important needs in order to do better in 2018. The players have no proper facilities to train. They are in Division I Segment 2B.
KINGSWOOD COLLEGE: They began the season well, out of the three matches in Division I Segment 2B with wins over Maliyadeva, Ananda and St. Sylvester’s. Their last game is with Vidyartha for which a date has yet to be fixed. Kingswood are led by S.S.Jamson and are coached by D.D.S. Gamage who guided the under 18 side to win the All Island championship last season. They were the first to play the game when they were known as Kandy Boys High School. The match was against Trinity, which ended in a 6-all draw. They gave up rugby and re started in the 1970’s.
DHARMARAJA COLLEGE: Playing in Division 1 Segment 1A they are led by Shamika Perera and coached by Isipathanian Kapila de Silva, who has done a good job in coaching the team against all odds. Performance wise the team has given a dismal display. They have won only one match but almost every game saw a very close call towards their victory, means the team has not reached peak form and lack experience, the last outing against D.S. Senanayake and lost to Royal in the last few seconds of the game. Isipthana and St.Joseph’s were close games. They are left with two more games with St. Anthony’s and St. Peter’s. It is hoped that at least in the second round, the players will play some attacking rugby.
SRI SUMANGALA COLLEGE: They are with two wins against Carey and Moratuwa Vidyalaya but lost to St. Benedict’s and Nalanda. Their next game is with Panadura Royal. They are led by Supun Madushanka and coached by former Army, Defence Services and Sri Lanka player G. Dharmapala. Rugby has caught up well and there is great potential in the team’s performance. They lack the basic facility of grounds to train. They play in Division I Segment 2C.
SRI RAHULA: Playing in Division 2 Segment 1B they have played two games won against Dharmapala Pannipitiya and lost to Padukka Priyarathne. They have to play against Nugawela, St. Aloysius and Devapathiraja. The side is led W.M. Yohan and coached by Nalin.
