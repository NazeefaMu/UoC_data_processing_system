KPMG and Alibaba Cloud to form global alliance to help advance digital busines

KPMG International and Alibaba Cloud, the cloud computing arm of Alibaba Group, announced plans to form a global alliance to provide digital transformation to businesses of all sizes and across multiple industries initially in Asia-Pacific and Europe. The alliance was announced at Alibaba’s largest global customer and partner event, the Computing Conference 2018.
The alliance will focus on digital transformation, “new retail”, IT strategy consulting and cloud-based digital solutions. Alibaba’s strong cloud computing and artificial intelligence capabilities, together with KPMG’s global network, global enterprise solutions, business acumen and knowledge of global industries with many Fortune 1000 companies will complement each other in helping clients to expand into new markets. The aim is to build a strong global ecosystem with cloud services and infrastructure, particularly serving organizations with multi-cloud strategies including small-to medium-sized enterprises.
Moreover, the alliance will provide an avenue for KPMG clients in APAC and Europe seeking access to the China market to establish local cloud services from Alibaba Cloud.
As one of the world’s leading global infrastructure-as-a-service (IaaS) providers, and China’s largest provider of public cloud services, Alibaba Cloud will be the latest global cloud provider to join KPMG’s alliance community, allowing KPMG to offer businesses with multi-cloud strategies a single, independent advisor for cloud- and platform-based digital services and solutions.
Said Honson To, Chairman, KPMG China and Asia-Pacific region: “We’re very pleased to form analliance with Alibaba Cloud as this relationship will further our commitment to help clients address key transformation priorities in the areas of growth, innovation and operational efficiency.As businesses continue to embark on their cloud transformation strategies to address these challenges, they can feel confident that KPMG and Alibaba Cloud teams around the world together can address their specific needs for global, scalable, cloud-based digital solutions.”
Simon Hu, President of Alibaba Cloud said: “Alibaba Cloud is excited to drive innovations across different industries and businesses together with KPMG, and to address the ever-growing needs of high performance and secure cloud infrastructure. Through our alliance, we will help empower KPMG clients with cutting edge cloud technologies and experience to advance digital transformation in various verticals.”
