54th “Battle of the Brothers” begins today : Thurstan have the edge over Isipathana

Thurstan College with eight victories under their belt will go out firm favourites when they confront traditional rivals Isipathana College in the 54th Battle of the Brothers which begins today at the SSC Grounds.
Thurstan under the leadership of Kasun Abeyratne are going great guns this season including outrights victories over formidable teams such as Prince of Wales, Nalanda, Maliyadeva and Richmond and will go all out to break the 25-year hoodoo having last tasted victory in 1992 under McKenzie Perera.
Sri Lanka under 19 player Charana Nanayakkara is Thurstan’s key player with 732 runs including a century and five half centuries and 48 wickets.
Other noteworthy contributions have come from skipper Kasun Abeyratne who smashed a record century in last year’s Big Match. Another outstanding player in their batting line up is centurion Prageesha Mendis who has contributed 322 runs to the team. All rounder Sawan Prabash has piled up 560 runs with three half tons and bagged 15 wickets this season. Right hand batsman Nimesh Lakshan has given his full support to his team and has scored 485 runs.
Their match winner has been leg spinner Naveen Gunawardana who has taken 76 wickets including 10 wickets for 36 in one innings against DS Senanayake and another fine spell in which he took nine wickets against Maliyadeva. He has been well supported by Charana Nanayakkara.
Isipathana College despite fielding an experienced side have not lived up to expectations winning just two matches outright against Sri Sumangala and President’s College, Rajagiriya winning seven games on 1st innings and losing to Mahanama outright while suffering five first innings losses.
A second year coloursman Pathum Nissanka who represented Sri Lanka Under 19 team against South Africa and England is their leading run getter with 925 including a double century against President’s College, Rajagiriya and three tons.
Fourth year coloursman Isipathana skipper Sanjula Abeywickrama, a left-handed top order batsman and the wicket keeper of the team has piled up 575 runs this season and contributed 75 runs in the last year’s Big Match.
All rounder Ayana Siriwardana, Vice Captain of the team has also contributed lavishly with 706 runs. He has been impressive with the ball too taking 19 wickets and his best was 7 for 54 against St. Peter’s.
Paceman Neranjan Wanniarachchi will open the attack for Isipathana but their main strike bowler is left arm leg spinner Lahiru Dilshan who has taken 60 wickets. The spin department will be strengthened by second year coloursman, off spinner Heshan Danushka Fernando who has captured 25 wickets and off spinner Ayana Siriwardana 19 wickets.
The series tally stands at Thurstan five victories and Isipathana four wins (last victory in 1999).
Kasun Abeyratne, skipper of Thurstan College said that “This time around we are going out for an outright win and I’m sure our boys will rise up to the occasion. We have a well balanced team in all three fronts.”
Sanjula Abeywickrama, Isipathana’s skipper mentioned “We too have a balanced team, I won’t single out any player because everyone has played well. The big match is just another game for us, the only difference is that there will be a bit of a crowd. We will first look at winning on first innings and then see where we stand and go for the outright win.”
