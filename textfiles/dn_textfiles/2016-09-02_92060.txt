Joining hands with Trail through #Dance forTrail

 
Wellawatta Nithyakalyani Jewellery organized a Bharathanatya recital at New Kathiresan Hall, Bambalapitiya along with Trail to raise funds for the Trail Karapitiya Cancer Hospital. Dhakshayani Jayarajah, a fashion designer by profession, performed in this event in memory of her uncle and late founder of Wellawatta Nithyakalyani Jewellery M Balasubramaniam.
Daughter of Wellawatta Nithyakalyani CEO A P Jayarajah, DHakshayani is a disciple of Smt. Shivanandhi Haridharshan and has been dancing from the age of 5 years. She brought all her experience to play at #dancefortrail, which was held under the patronage of D M Swaminathan and other distinguished guests.
The fund raiser event was targeted at collecting generous donations from invitees and all funds collected from the event were routed to Trail/Colours of Courage Trust.
Nathan Sivagurunathan and Sarinda Unamboowe, founders of Trail set upon their goal to enhance cancer treatment facilities in 2011 through the Trail walk which began at Dondra Head in the South and ended in Point Pedro in the North.
The walk which covered a distance of 670kms over a span of 27 days, helped create awareness on cancer and raised over USD 2.6 million, which was used to complete the Tellippalai Trail Cancer Hospital in January 2014.
Wellawatta Nithyakalyani Jewellery had raised USD 100,000 in 2011 through Rotary Foundation and Rotary Colombo East for the cancer facility in the North. They joined hands with Trail once again where the donations collected from #DanceforTrail will be utilized along with the funds collected from the Trail walk 2016 in order to build the cancer treatment facility in the South.
The walk titled “Trail 2016” commences on October 6 from Point Pedro and is expected to complete at Dondra Head on November 2.
