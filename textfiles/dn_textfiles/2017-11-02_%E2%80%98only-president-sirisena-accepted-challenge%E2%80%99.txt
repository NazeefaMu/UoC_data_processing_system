‘Only President Sirisena accepted the challenge’

The only leader who accepted the challenge of implementing the Nilwala-Gin Ganga Project is President Maithripala Sirisena, said Fisheries and Aquatic Resources Minister Mahinda Amaraweera.
He was addressing a meeting following the distribution of jayabhoomi ownership deeds at Angunakolapelessa.
The minster said that this project will become the country’s main irrigation project and that this will be a solution to the burning problem of scarcity of water in the Hambantota district. This project will also be a boon to foreign and local investors who plan to launch industrial ventures.
The people in the district knew how the lands in the district were distributed. Henchmen of the previous regime and the then politicians were the owners of State lands in the Hambantota district. There are thousands of families in the district without a shelter, but politicians never listened to their grievances, the minister added.
The minister said that industrial and service projects would provide thousands of jobs to unemployed youths in the district with a reasonable salary. Most of the families within the Mahaweli Authority area remained without ownership deeds for decades, but today, their expectations have been fulfilled.
