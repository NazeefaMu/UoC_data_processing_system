Sri Lanka participates in Korean dance festival

Sri Lanka was fortunate to have been selected to participate in the 46th annual Andong Dance Festival held in Korea. This annual dance festival was held by the Andong Tourism Foundation with the support of the Koran Ministry of Culture Sports and Tourism. The festival has been ranked among the top 10 dance festivals out of over 1,500 such festivals held annually in Korea.
It is of special significance to both Sri Lanka and Korea since the two countries celebrate their 40th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic ties with each other, this year. The Kandy Girls' High School was selected to participate in this festival and was one of the 12 foreign countries invited to participate. This Festival drew 300 overseas participants and 1,000 dancers and musicians from 30 different dance troupes in Korea.
The Andog Province Governor was the chief guest at the opening ceremony where each foreign dance troupe was allocated 60 seconds to perform a traditional dance from their country. This was followed by a fireworks display that lasted for over 15 minutes.
The Kandy Girls' High School troupe was fortunate to be drawn among the first three foreign dance troupes to perform on the main stage on the first day of performance and were allocated 20 minutes. The items for the 20-minute programme included a solo magul bera performance by Saduni Gayathri, who was placed first in the all-island drumming competition in Sri Lanka.
Kandy Girls' High School Principal Malkanthi Abeygunasekara and Tilak Fernando were the co-directors of the dance troupe. The drummer of the dance troupe and Tilak Fernando were invited by the Korean Broadcasting System for an interview.
