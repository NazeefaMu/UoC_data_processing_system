Explore Lankan cashew

The Sri Lanka Tourism Development Authority (SLTDA) organized a cashew tasting event for a group of social media influencers in Colombo, last week.
The cashew tasting held at the Sri Lanka Institute of Tourism and Hotel Management restaurant was organized to promote and strengthen the traditional cashew sellers of Kajugama and Sri Lanka's diverse cashew products.
The SLTDA recently launched a series of initiatives to strengthen the traditional cashew sellers of Kajugama who offer an invaluable service to tourists visiting Sri Lanka. The cashew tasting was facilitated by Ran Crisp, a leading cashew brand in Sri Lanka.
On the sidelines of the event, SLTDA Chairman Kavan Ratnayaka praised the work the Sri Lankan social media influencers have been doing on their own to promote Sri Lanka as a Tourist Destination and explained the Tourism Strategic Plan of 2020 which recommends actions and implementation mechanisms for the next three years.
He further stated that SLTDA is looking forward to work with them as digital media is the future.
The influencers also got the opportunity to participate in a Q&A session with the Chairman of SLTDA where many of them shared their views on the current position of tourism in Sri Lanka.
