Patali Champika tasked with clearing canals

Megapolis and Western Development Minister Patali Champika Ranawaka has been entrusted with the task of clearing the blocked canals in and around the Colombo city.
The Cabinet Sub-Committee which met on Wednesday has given full authority to Minister Ranawaka in this regard. The minister, who was previously given full authority to ensure proper and efficient garbage disposal in Colombo, had shouldered the task successfully during the past few weeks. The new assignment comes on the heels of this success.
Ranawaka said he would shoulder the task of clearing the canals from today by coordinating with all relevant institutions. Starting from July 5, 754 individuals have been arrested within 14 days for illegal dumping of garbage on the roadside.
Garbage disposal is constantly supervised and daily reviews are conducted at 7 pm at the Colombo Municipal Council (CMC) hall with the attendance of Colombo, Moratuwa, Kotte, Dehiwala-Mount Lavinia, Kelaniya and Kaduwela Special Commissioners and the OICs, Engineers, PHIs and garbage collecting private companies namely Abans and Care Cleaning.
