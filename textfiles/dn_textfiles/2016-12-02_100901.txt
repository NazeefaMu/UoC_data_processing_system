Air Force accepts two PT-6 Aircraft after overhaul

The first two PT-6 Aircraft overhauled at the Aircraft Overhaul Wing at Sri Lanka Air Force Base, Katunayake, were accepted by Air Force Commander Air Marshal Kapila Jayampathy at Katunayake yesterday.
The Aircraft Overhaul Wing was established early this year with the technical assistance of M/S CATIC. The Chinese specialist will assist and guide the SLAF in establishing the facilities in the first few overhauls. They will withdraw gradually, leaving the SLAF with the capability to handle overhauls.
Technology transfer is a common practice in most countries where foreign origin aircraft are inducted and used. The practice permits the user nation to ensure longevity of the platforms that they acquire without having to rely on foreign assistance and having to dispatch aircraft overseas at great expense.
