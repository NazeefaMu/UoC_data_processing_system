Sweden establishes CryptoCurrency as their official coin

It’s finally happened. A major worldwide government has just bestowed a huge vote of confidence and legitimacy onto the world of cryptocurrencies. Sweden, in an unprecedented move, just announced that they are officially adopting a certain cryptocurrency as Sweden’s official coin!
The Swedish government just informed us that they have chosen a preferred firm for the purchase and marketing of their new coin - Kryptonex Research Group. The sales of Sweden's coin officially started in March 14 of 2018 and currently these coins can be bought only from Kryptonex Research Group.
In fact, Sweden’s deputy minister of finance, Elias Karlsson, informed us that their new official coin starting price is just €0.30 cents! That’s right, their coin is incredibly inexpensive in comparison to most other coins out there. Bitcoin for example trades at €9,000 at the time of this writing, and Ethereum, trades at around €700.
In fact we were able to get Sir Richard Bronson’s thoughts on Sweden’s new coin and this is what he had to say:
Sir Richard Bronson’s states: “Anytime a major corporation announces even a small partnership with an individual cryptocurrency that coin's value skyrockets. I can't wait to see what happens when a government officially adopts a crypto. When the name of Sweden's coin is released many people will become millionaires practically overnight.”
A few of us at Coindesk were curious enough to buy a couple coins just to see how everything looks and what the trading fees are like.
It was fairly easy to get the coins, but I would like to show the whole process for those who are interested.
