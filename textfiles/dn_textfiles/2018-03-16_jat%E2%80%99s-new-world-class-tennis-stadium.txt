JAT’s: new world-class tennis stadium

JAT Holdings recently commenced a joint-initiative with the Sri Lanka Tennis Association (SLTA) to build “JAT Stadium” at the SLTA premises. Earl of Wessex, Prince Edward and the Countess of Wessex, Sophie during their official visit to Sri Lanka laid the foundation stone.
Sports Minister, Dayasiri Jayasekara, JAT Holdings Managing Director, Aelian Gunawardene and President of the SLTA, Iqbal Bin Isac were also present. Financed and developed by JAT Holdings, the complex will consist of 80,000 square feet of exhibition space located on two levels, for high end interior design, life style and sports products.
The five world class indoor tennis courts on the top level will be built to international standards in order to host and facilitate players, press and spectators. Ample parking facilities, a refurbished club house, sports library, 100 pax conference facility and restaurant are also on the cards. The existing ground-level outdoor tennis courts will also be revamped and flood lighting added for night time play.
Speaking at the ceremony Managing Director of JAT Holdings Aelian Gunawardene said JAT Holdings has had a longstanding commitment to uplifting all sports in Sri Lanka. “This initiative will no doubt take Sri Lankan tennis to the next level.
The design and structure have been meticulously planned out with the involvement of renowned architect Bernard Gomez and our own experts to ensure that it is truly a world-class stadium,” Gunawardene said.
As the sole local representative of the International Tennis Federation, and tennis in Sri Lanka, the SLTA has a broad based national agenda which includes improving standards through training, selection, conducting international and local tournaments, and increasing spectator and public awareness in the sport.
