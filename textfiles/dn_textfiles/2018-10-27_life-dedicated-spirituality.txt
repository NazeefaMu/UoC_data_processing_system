Sri Lanka’s First Cardinal His Eminence Thomas Cardinal Cooray OMI - 30th death anniversary:
Life dedicated to spirituality

Born on December 29, 1901 in the little hamlet of Periyamulla in Negombo into a modest but devout Catholic family as the fifth child and its third son, Thomas Benjamin Cardinal Cooray OMI became the first ever native archbishop of the metropolitan See of Colombo on July 28, 1947 with the sudden demise of Archbishop Jean-Marie Masson OMI the last foreign prelate to hold that office. The Church authorities of Rome had decided wisely that it was the opportune time for the administration of the Catholic Church to pass on to native hands especially with the Independence era about to dawn on Ceylon the following year. His Eminence Cardinal Cooray passed away on October 28, 1988, having held the reins of office for 30 years. His mortal remains are interred in the crypt of the National Basilica of Our Lady of Lanka at Tewatte. His entire life had been marked by the pursuit of personal holiness, faithfully shepherding his flock, the archdiocese of Colombo and leading the Catholic Church into its post-Independence era. At the time of his demise, he had been a Religious for 63 years, a priest for 59 years, in episcopal rank for 42 years and a Cardinal for 23 years.
The Dawning of the Cooray-Era
At the time of his appointment, Fr. Thomas Benjamin Cooray OMI had earlier been a member of the staff of St. Joseph’s College, later holding responsibilities as the warden of the Catholic hostel for university students and finally, the office of the Director of the Oblate Major seminary in Borella. He became archbishop at the age of 46. With brilliant academic careers both here and in Rome where he was sent by his superiors for continued priestly and missionary training, coupled with many experiences in the spiritual formation of the young and in matters of ecclesiastical administration, Fr. Cooray was well equipped to become the first native archbishop of Colombo and spearhead the Catholic Church in Sri Lanka. He joined the minor seminary at the age of 12 finishing his education with a B.A. (Lond) and while in Rome, was ordained priest in June 1929. He returned to Ceylon in 1931 earning two doctorates with highest honours in Philosophy and Theology and got his first appointment to the staff of St. Joseph’s College, Colombo.
The Cooray-Era that began in 1947 lasted until 1976, when he retired at the canonical age stipulated by Church Law. His period of stewardship saw tremendous change that came over the Catholic Church which entered the post-independence era. To crown it all, Archbishop Cooray was created Sri Lanka’s first ever Cardinal in 1965 by St. Pope Paul VI, thus becoming the 5th Asian to be bestowed with this highest honor and the third in the history of the OMI congregation. As archbishop he had the privilege of having as co-workers Fr. Peter A. Pillai OMI, an intellectual colossus of his time, Fr. D.J. Nicholas Perera OMI who was in the team of delegates that approached the Colonial Secretary in Britain demanding Independence for Ceylon as far back as 1920, appointed as liaison between Church and State and the stalwart Frenchman Fr. Gerard Fortin OMI who was known as a working dynamo. Thus in his choice of collaborators he succeeded in engaging well, the local priests and foreign missionaries to launch a new era in Sri Lanka’s modern Church history. As a leader he believed in harnessing the talents of others.
Some Vicissitudes of his Involvements
More than his administrative talents and ability to maintain good relations with all, he was known even during his life time as priest, archbishop and cardinal for sanctity and holiness of life. He was lauded as a man of principles, undaunted defender of justice, ever-strong in his convictions and always sensitive towards others in empathy and understanding. Even today those who knew him have great reminiscences of his spirit of kindness and compassion to all. He desired goodwill and spirit of solidarity to animate the life in the various ranks in the church such as the priests, the religious men and women and the lay faithful towards all of whom he exercised a strikingly paternal care. He was more than convinced of his spiritual obligations towards all of them.
Even in times of difficulties, crisis and problems, His Eminence Cardinal Cooray held himself in calm disposition of mind and took decisions that were inspired by a sense of humanity and love for people.
His concern for victims of natural disasters such as the floods of the mid-fifties in Chilaw and that of the mid-sixteees in the north and east had been admirable, visiting these victims personally and organising relief-services. Even today people talk about his involvements with the conditions of living and work of the farmers in the North Central Province and the fisher-folk along the coastal belt of the western province. Some of the best Catholic initiatives for elevating the standard of living, employment and integral formation of these ranks of workers and those of young Christian workers were launched by Archbishop Cooray.
He had a special place in his heart for the poor youth of the rural areas and those who could not continue schooling due to financial constraints and also juvenile delinquents who needed rehabilitation. His Eminence Cardinal Cooray was very much distressed at the spate of violence that overtook the youth in 1970’s erupting in the youth insurrection of April 1971. He assisted the government in rehabilitation programmes and appealed to the errant youth to adopt non-violent means to address injustices and to claim their rights of to education and employment through patient dialogue and discussion with the government. From his earliest days as Archbishop he had serious concerns about the impact of Marxism and leftist tendencies intruding into the mainstream of national politics and universities, which made him warn about impending disasters that would follow in the blind pursuit of radical socialism. There was no possibility of reconciling such materialistic and purely economic ideologies with the great and noble values proclaimed by the great religions practiced in the country for centuries.
Cardinal Cooray and the Nation
Archbishop and Cardinal Cooray maintained excellent relationships with the governing authorities from whichever party-hue they came whilst expecting from these seats of power justice and fair-play for all: majority community as well as minorities. He wished to see Ceylon becoming more and more indigenous, learning how to tap the natural and cultural resources it enjoyed while being open to modern technology, including mass media and to carefully avoid pitfalls of western cultural value systems. He was a great lover of nature and the plant world as we can see from the oasis of the mighty trees that offer shade around the national basilica of Our Lady of Lanka in the hamlet of Tewatte (Ragama): clusters of trees that he himself had planned and planted. His sensitivity to the needs of the poor is seen in his proposal made already in 1946 for the erection of an overhead-bridge at the Ragama Railway intersection to ease the congestion of traffic and thus enabling easy mobility to pilgrims flocking the shrine of Tewatte and poor patients coming to the Ragama hospital. His Eminence Cardinal Cooray welcomed with patriotic joy, the new constitution of 1972 which declared colonial Ceylon to be a new independent Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka, though he was swift to advice the government not to hurry through a new constitution without sufficient consultation.
He shared the sorrow with his co-patriots at the sudden death of the father of the nation, D.S. Senanayake and kept longing for stable governments to continue ensuring his policies for national development, working towards an agro-economy and national unity.
He fought heard for the rights of the Catholic Church and the Christian minority of the country when land bills and education policies enacted at times, affected them adversely.
His concept of education was that it be integral, thus forming a growing child holistically and inclusive of a sound religious formation. Archbishop Cooray is well-known for his bitter opposition to the Schools Takes-Over of 1960 in which the Church lost nearly 600 schools that were under its administration. He firmly believed of the crucial need of a Catholic atmosphere for the education of Catholic children and the parents’ right to choose a Catholic institution for the education of their children.
Towards an Indigenized Church
The “Cooray Era” brought in an in-culturated Church with its buildings and worship taking on a local cultural touch. One saw also with the departure of the foreign Catholic missionaries as a result of certain government restrictions on visas, the emergence of a local Clergy that could replace them and take on reins of responsibility in running the Church’s affairs. All in all, Catholicism and Christianity in general had entered a new phase within independent Sri Lanka and were gradually becoming part of the country’s identity. His dream was to see a Sri Lankan Church with its adherents also living and contributing their best to the common good of the nation. Hence we see that Cardinal Cooray has made a great and significant contribution to the country and can easily be seen as a true patriot, a great religious leader, an illustrious prelate and a pioneer.
Path to Sainthood
Within the Catholic community, he has always been regarded as a person of sanctity who pursued and gave primacy to spirituality in all his undertakings. This striking witness of his life bolstered also by facts and documents pertaining to his work and activities, made it possible for the cause of his canonization as a saint to be introduced by Cardinal Malcolm Ranjith in October 2010, It was completed in 2017. All documentation pertaining to this process now rest with the relevant departments in the Vatican City for review and final approval. With an eventual miracle of a cure or healing through his intercession, that will attest to the sanctity of His Eminence Cardinal Cooray and declared to be so by medical experts, the path to sainthood will be assured. If declared a saint, His Eminence Thomas Cardinal Cooray OMI will become the first ever Sri Lankan saint, one from our own soil, who will be a source of jubilation and pride not only to the Catholics here and the universal Church, but also to entire Sri Lanka, the pearl of the Indies.
May one of the great dreams of His Eminence Cardinal Cooray who loved his motherland in true patriotic grace, soon come to pass with the dawn of a truly united and prosperous nation which provides safe sanctuary to its ancient religious teachings and noble cultural traditions.
