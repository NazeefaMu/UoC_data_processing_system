New Megapolis Project underway

Call for proposals to be announced this weekend:
The Sri Lanka Land Reclamation and Development Corporation (SLLRDC) under the Ministry of Megapolis and Western Development (GOSL), will initiate the tender process this weekend for the first leg of a proposed ferry transport system in Colombo. The project will be implemented as a public/private partnership.
As detailed in the 2016 Megapolis transport master plan, several of Colombo’s inland waterways would be utilized for passenger ferries whereby commuters and recreational users may travel across various parts of Colombo, avoiding traffic and enjoying scenic views. The first phase
would be a service from Wellawatte to Battaramulla. A ferry service from Fort to Union Place in the Beira Lake, as well as from Mattakkuliya to Hanwella along the Kelani River are also in the pipeline, as are potential other routes such as the Hamilton Canal towards Negombo.
The tender process which is open to both international and local investors, is being supported by PPP advisors from the Government of the Netherlands, under a Government-to-Government technical assistance initiative. The Sri Lanka Land Reclamation and Development Corporation
(SLLRDC) under the Ministry of Megapolis and Western Development (GOSL) will be the lead agency for the project. Tender notices and detailed documentation for bidders will be posted on www.megapolis.gov.lk and www.landreclamation.lk on Sunday and an investor dialog is expected to be held in July.
The service along the Wellawatte-Battaramulla canal is expected to be operational in early 2018, and the Beira Lake ferry to be operational within the year as well.
