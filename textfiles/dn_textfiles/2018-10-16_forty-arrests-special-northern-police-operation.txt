Forty arrests in special Northern Police operation

Forty arrests were made after a special search operation was carried out in the Northern Province with the participation of around 500 Police officers.
Speaking to the Daily News, Jaffna Senior DIG Roshan Fernando said 40 roadblocks had been set up with 10 roadblocks each in the Kopai, Chunnakam, Jaffna and Manipai areas, specially targetting the Inuvil and Kokkuvil areas where most of this gang violence has been reported.
“There were around 12 Police officers stationed at each roadblock,” the Senior DIG said.
He said these operations were carried out under the supervision of the SSPs.
“During the search operations at these roadblocks, we paid special attention to motorcycles.
The search operation commenced at 4.00 pm and concluded at around 10 pm.
These special operations were carried out with the aim of putting a stop to gang related violence in the North. These incidents are not serious, but we want to nip it in the bud before it gets out of hand,” Senior DIG Fernando said, adding that this operation was a huge success.
“During the operation, the Police had made 40 arrests including seven with warrants against them, 16 drunk drivers, seven wanted suspects and 10 arrested on suspicion. A further 152 traffic related cases were filed and these suspects would be produced before courts for legal action,” he said.
Senior DIG Fernando noted that these mass scale Police operations would be continued to curb gang violence in the North.
However, he said these operations were carried out in a manner that would not infringe on the normal activities of the people living in these areas. The Police had commenced these special search operations with the aim of bringing under control the ‘Aava’ gangs and other splinter gangs that operate in these areas, creating fear in the minds of the Northern people.
However, Senior DIG Fernando pointed out that in comparison to the violence reported in the Southern parts of the country, the Northern Province has a relatively lower crime rate, but said that these special operations would help further reduce the crime rate.
