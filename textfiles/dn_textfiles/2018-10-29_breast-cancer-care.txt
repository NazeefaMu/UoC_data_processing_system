Breast cancer care

This week Oncologists, Consultant Community Physicians and other health professionals attached to the National Cancer Control Programme of the Health Ministry speak about available medical treatment for breast cancer which is the commonest cancer among Sri Lankan women.
The age specific rate of breast cancer in Sri Lanka is 22.2 per cent by last year (2016) while it was only 18 per cent in 2009. The life time breast cancer risk in Sri Lanka is one in every 40 (38) women.
Poor survival in breast cancer is mainly attributed to the advanced stage of the disease at diagnosis. The choice of treatment for breast cancer depends on the tumors as well as patient related factors.
Surgery
* Breast conserving surgery - Rages from a Lumpectomy, wide local excision to a Partial Mastectomy or Quadrantectomy.
* Mastectomy - Removal of all breast tissue including the nipple.
Breast Reconstruction Surgery can be done at the same time as Mastectomy (immediate reconstruction) or it can be carried out later (delayed reconstruction).
* Lymph Node Surgery - Sentinel lymph node biopsy may be carried out to find out the stage of the tumor.
Radiotherapy
* Breast Radiotherapy is done following breast conserving surgery.
* Chest wall Radiotherapy is done following mastectomy.
* Breast Boost - Some women may be offered a boost of high dose radiotherapy in the area where the cancer was removed.
* Radiotherapy to lymph nodes is for metastatic cancer with a spread to axillary lymph nodes.
Chemotherapy
* Neo-adjuvant is Cytotoxic medication given prior to the surgery to shrink the lump.
* Chemotherapy is usually a combination of Cytotoxic drugs are given following the surgery.
* Chemotherapy for breast cancer is given in cycles. The cycle for chemotherapy can vary from once a week to once in every three weeks. Each treatment session is followed by a period of recovery.
Hormone Treatment
For hormone receptor (Oestrogen / Progesterone) positive tumors medications that stop the body from making estrogen after menopause is given. Aromatase inhibitors are a class of medicines that reduce the amount of estrogen in your body, depriving breast cancer cells of the hormones they need to grow and thrive. Aromatase inhibitors are used to treat breast cancer.
Targeted Therapy
Therapy is targeted for tumors with human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2). About one in five women with breast cancer, the cancer cells have too much of a growth-promoting protein known as HER2/neu (or just HER2) on their surface. The side effects of Targeted Therapy are skin problems (acneiform rash, dry skin, nail changes, hair depigmentation), problems with blood clotting and wound healing, high blood pressure and gastrointestinal perforation (a rare side effect of some targeted therapies).
