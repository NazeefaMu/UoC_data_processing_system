Presidential Commission probing SriLankan Airlines:
Former SriLankan Chairman’s decision resulted in over Rs.10 mn loss to airline - Air Traffic Controller Managers

Due to former SriLankan Airlines Chairman Nishantha Wickremesinghe changing a decision taken by highly trained professionals with regard to the departure time of a flight scheduled for Paris in 2014, the Airline had to incur a loss exceeding Rs.10 Million, two air traffic operation control managers giving evidence before the Presidential Commission inquiring into irregularities in connection with Sri Lankan Airlines, Sri Lankan Catering and Mihin Lanka yesterday said.
The witnesses also said that former Chairman’s decision had a negative impact on the international reputation of Sri Lankan Airlines.
The Air Traffic Controller Managers Dhammika Senanayake and Nishantha Handapangoda giving evidence before the Commission yesterday also said that it was the first time that a SriLankan Airlines Chairman took decisions regarding air traffic control.
The decision referred to concerns UL 563 flight bound for Paris on Januray 25, 2014.
The Air Traffic controllers had taken a decision to delay the flight slightly taking into considerations the requirements of the passengers. However Wickremasinghe had allegedly ordered for the flight to procedd without further delay.
Due to this decision authorities had to delay UL 553 flight bound for Frankfurt and 75 passengers had missed connecting flights and the Airline had to pay close to Rs.10 million for the inconvenienced passengers.
According to evidence, the said flight has been delayed for a particular time as it was the only one bound to Paris. However, the former Chairman Wickremesinghe had ordered the flight to leave saying that there is a group of diplomats in the flight who needs to reach France on time. The Air Traffic controllers said they were not aware who the diplomats were.
