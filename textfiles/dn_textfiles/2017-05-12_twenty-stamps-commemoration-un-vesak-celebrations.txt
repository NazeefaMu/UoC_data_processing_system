The Postal Department will issue twenty postal stamps in commemoration of UN Vesak celebration in Colombo.
Twenty of the world’s most sacred Buddhists sites such as the Kandy Lankatilaka Temple, the Lumbini Temple in Nepal, India’s Gupta Temple in Sanchi, the Horyuji Temple in China and the Sompura Temple in Bangladesh will be illustrated on these stamps.
In addition, a book containing stamps issued by the Postal Department thus far will also be published to mark the occasion.
