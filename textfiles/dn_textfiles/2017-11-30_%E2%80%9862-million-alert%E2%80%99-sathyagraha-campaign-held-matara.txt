‘6.2 million on alert’ Sathyagraha campaign held in Matara

“Let’s make use of this most opportune moment at which the Sri Lanka Freedom Party and the United National Party have formed a consensus government to finalize and adopt a new constitution for Sri Lanka as we do not know who will be elected as Executive President in the future”, said Minister of Finance and Media Mangala Samaraweera addressing all who participated in a silent protest to reaffirm public support for the intended reforms to the constitution.
The third of the ‘Sathyagraha’ campaign named as ‘6.2 million on alert’ being carried out island wide was held opposite the Sacred Bo Tree in Matara last Friday (24th) evening. TNA Member of Parliament M. A. Sumanthiran, Ven. Dambara Amila Thera, Leader of the NSSP Wickremabahu Karunarathne together with members of the clergy and activists who supported National Movement for a Just Society attended the event.
“By Prime Minister Ranil Wickremasinghe being subject to cross examination by the Attorney General when he was summoned before the Commission appointed by His Excellency the President to investigate the Central Bank Bond issue this government of good governance has proved that no one is above the law.” the Minister said.
“Power should be devolved to an extent where every citizen can live amicably as one family and refer to Sri Lanka as ‘our nation’ said Tamil National Alliance Member of Parliament M. A. Sumanthiran addressing those present in Sinhala. He related a story of a family comprising of three girls and boy who decided where they were to spend their school vacations. Every time a vote was taken the girls had the majority vote until such time that the boy was forced to revolt against the democratic process which in this instance was unfair.”
Ven. Dambara Amila Thera said “Former Minister N. M. Perera forecasted that the executive powers vested by the new constitution promulgated by the National Assembly in 1978 would someday have a disastrous effect on day to day life.
Leader of the NSSP Dr. Wickremabahu Karunarathne said that Member of Parliament M. A. Sumanthiran was in Matara to address the people of the South in their own language because he had trust in the present government. “In the past, northern politicians who addressed the people of the South in Sinhala were assassinated by northern extremists. Sumanthiran has ignored this threat as this may be the last opportunity to adopt a new constitution”, said the NSSP Leader.
