Pakistan’s General Hayat calls on SLAF Commander

Pakistan Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Committee, General Zubair Mahmood Hayat called on Air Force Commander Air Marshal Kapila Jayampathy yesterday at Air Force Headquarters, Colombo.
General Hayat was received upon arrival by the commanding Officer of SLAF Station Colombo, Air Commodore Waruna Gunawardana and was conferred a guard of honour by the Colour Wing of the SLAF commanded by Flight Lieutenant L.N. Mayuranga.
General Hayat discussed matters of mutual interest with the SLAF Commander. He also met with the Chief of Staff of the SLAF, Air Vice Marshal Sumangala Dias and the Air Force Board of Management after which official plaques were exchanged to mark the occasion.
Adding uniqueness to his visit, the visiting General symbolically handed over six stallions to the Air Force Commander. These stallions arrived in the island on Tuesday by an SLAF C-130 aircraft, which flew them in from Islamabad, Pakistan.
