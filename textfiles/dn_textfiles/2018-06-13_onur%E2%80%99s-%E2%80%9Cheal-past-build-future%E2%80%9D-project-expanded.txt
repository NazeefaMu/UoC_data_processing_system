ONUR’s “Heal the Past Build the Future” project expanded

The Office for National Unity and Reconciliation (ONUR) has taken steps to expand “Heal the Past Build the Future” project in 14 districts more to create a discourse on reconciliation at grass root level. The pilot project of this programme was conducted in Jaffna, Anuradhapura and Ratnapura earlier.
The chosen new districts include Ampara, Mannar, Galle, Kalutara, Kilinochchi, Kurunagala, Matara, Monaragala, Nuwara-Eliya, Batticaloa, Trincomalee, Mullaitivu and Vauniya.
The overall objective of this unique initiative is that physical and human infrastructure at the level of divisional secretaries is developed and strengthened for designing and implementing a national level reconciliation initiative in Sri Lanka.
The special objectives of the initiative include developing a carder of trainers who will closely work with divisional secretaries to create a discourse on reconciliation among government officials and communities, develop and implement an awareness creation campaign on reconciliation among the relevant government officers at the regional level and develop a reconciliation programme known as seed activities, through Divisional Secretariats to be implemented at the community and regional levels.
