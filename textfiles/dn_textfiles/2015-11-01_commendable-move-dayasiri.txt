Commendable move by Dayasiri

Sports Minister Dayasiri Jayasekara has finally decided to abandon the controversial four-year law which prevents sports officials from holding Executive Committee positions of a National Sports Association (NSA) and also to reinstate democracy at the NSAs controlled by interim committees, including Sri Lanka Cricket (SLC).
He has promised to take immediate steps to amend the National Sports Law to fall in line with the International Olympic Charter before the end of next month and also to hold fresh elections thereafter to all NSAs.
The much-criticised new law prevented sports officials of all NSAs holding key positions for more than four successive years. This disqualified almost all veteran sports officials of the country from seeking re-election to their respective NSAs. That turned out to be a serious issue, not only because it violated the Olympic Charter but also created a dearth of experienced officials at NSAs.
The previous practice at most NSAs, including the Sri Lanka Rugby Football Union (SLRFU), was to groom future presidents to head their respective sports controlling bodies. But the sudden implementation of the new law, drafted during the tenure of Dr. Maiya Gunasekera as the Chairman of the National Sports Council, forced all seasoned sports officials from serving their NSAs.
But Dr. Gunasekara had even told the Dayasiri's predecessor Mahindananda Authgamage, during whose tenure the new legislations were introduced, that their recommendations had been misinterpreted when drafting the new law. The eminent medical surgeon had said that he would never have become the SLRFU President if the new law had been there during his time.
What Maiya had meant was not to allow a sports official holding on to any one position such as the President, Secretary, Treasurer or Vice President for more than two successive terms, that's a maximum of four years. But it had been interpreted in a different and drastic manner when drafting the new law - that's no official should be allowed to serve in any senior position for more than four years, instead of stating it as any 'one position'.
Maiya's thinking
What Maiya and his team originally meant was that a President or a Secretary of a NSA should not be allowed to remain in those top positions for more than four successive years. But due to the mistake make in drafting the new regulations, even a Vice President of a NSA, who had served for more than four years, was made ineligible to contest for a higher position as the President. The controversial law brought a totally inexperienced and amateur set of officials, who even had not served in their respective NSA's executive committees before, to the top administrative positions. Hence, the day-to-day affairs and administration functions of some NSAs were in a total mess as the new officials do not have the company of any experienced officials in the executive committees.
Moreover, the new law clashed with the accepted international sports regulations and the Olympic Charter. As a result, several international sports governing bodies, including the International Olympic Committee, had sounded warnings to local NSAs as well as the National Olympic Committee (NOC). In fact, the NOC had alerted the Sports Ministry a couple of years ago but their objections had been overruled by the then Sports Minister.
Apart from the IOC, some of the leading world sports governing bodies such as World Rugby and FIFA have severely criticized the new Lankan regulations and forced the local authorities to make necessary changes to fall in line with the international requirements such as the Olympic Charter. It is heartening to see the Sports Ministry, under the stewardship of the new minister Jayasekera, working closely with the NOC to iron out differences. Unless we do away with the controversial law and accept the Olympic Charter, Sri Lanka will be forced to the wilderness in international sport.
Dayasiri had sounded that elections to all NSAs could be completed before the end of March next year after abandoning the new four-year rule. He also intends to reinstate democracy at the NSAs which are currently run by interim committees, including the SLC.
"I want to make the law for sports, not for personal vendettas of certain individuals and settling this problem is my priority right now as sports minister," the Minister was quoted as saying at a recent news conference. Dayasiri had sought to draft the law with a maximum term of President and Secretary to be eight years. This allows any official to serve as Vice President or Secretary for four years and seek election as the President, or to serve as Executive Committee member for four years and seek election for any of the senior positions for another four years.
In addition, any person, who had held four or eight years as administrators in one NSA will be allowed to serve in the same position at another NSA, subject to winning the elections. In such case number of years will be counted disregarding positions held in former sports associations which is not permitted at present.
The current regulations implemented last year after the amendments brought during the tenure of Aluthagamage allow only four years of two successive terms for any top positions of a NSA. This prevented many experienced sports administrators from contesting this year's elections to their respective NSAs.
Timely action
Dayasiri has made a timely move to rectify all these problems and make Sri Lanka acceptable to international world of sport. Most importantly, the new Sports Minister has given an assurance that the Sports Ministry would not interfere with the elections of NSAs and would only play a role of an observer. Dayasiri had said that the NSAs will have full autonomy to carry out their functions, sans any interference from the Sports Ministry.
The Sports Minister is making a sincere attempt to get the ban on the local aquatic sports union be lifted by the world governing body FINA so that Sri Lankan swimmers would be allowed to participate in international events under the lion flag.
He has already taken steps to amend the sports law and regulations according to the principles of global Olympic Charter. He has also taken actions to submit the issues arising in relation to amending the sports law and regulations to the NOC.
Following his recent discussions with the Deputy Director General of the IOC Pero Miro in Lausanne, Switzerland, Dayasiri has got the clear picture on the IOC member countries' requirement to meet the Olympic Charter. Hence, he has agreed to amend the sports regulations before the end of this year and hold fresh elections to all local sports governing bodies.
Following his discussions with the IOC, along with the top NOC officials, the IOC has agreed to provide technical assistance to build the Sri Lanka Olympic Museum. Reputed sports administrator and veteran cricket umpire Saman Amarasinghe is playing an active role in Sri Lanka's attempts to establish a national Olympic museum.
We earnestly hope that Dayasiri would keep his promises so that democracy will be reinstated in some of the NSAs which are currently administrated by interim committees. Especially, several fishy deals of the SLC, which too is run by an interim committee, have come to light in recent times.
The Sports Ministry should initiate a thorough investigation on numerous allegations against the SLC Interim Committee as the officials are answerable to its member clubs and associations.
