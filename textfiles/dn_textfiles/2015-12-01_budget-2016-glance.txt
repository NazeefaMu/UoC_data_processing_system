Budget 2016 at a glance...

SC Securities, a fully owned subsidiary of Sampath Bank has done a study on the impact of the 2016 budget and they have weighed the advantages and disadvantages.
SC Securities express that the proposals from a point of view of the Colombo Stock Exchange to favour them.
Following are some of the selected budget proposals and the impacts from it to some of the segments.
Developments in favour of CSE
Share Transaction levy of 0.3% was removed. As a result, this will attract foreign investors’ interests into the Sri Lankan Equity Market.
Foreigners are allowed to bring in cash to any bank account without the name of a SIA. This relaxed currency regulation will increase the flow of funds to the economy.
Exporters were encouraged to bring in the funds generated and kept outside the country to Sri Lanka.
Foreign holding limit of Government Securities will be reduced from 12.5% to 10.0% - This will divert the interest of foreigners towards the equity market.
Lanka Hospitals, Hilton – Colombo, Hyatt Residencies, Waters’ Edge , Grand Oriental Hotel, Ceylinco Hospitals and Mobitel will be listed on CSE – This will increase the market capitalization of CSE, which will be favourable to the Sri Lankan Equity Market.
Promoting senior citizen deposits
We see the initiative taken to reduce the qualifying age from the present 60 years to 55 years and expanding the earlier deposits cap of LKR1mn to LKR1.5mn at an interest rate of 15.0% to increase cost of funding and to exert pressure on NIMs on banks. We expect this to reduce the earnings prospects in the industry,
Pawning Value As a % of Total
Seylan Bank PLC8.7bn4.90% Sampath Bank PLC15.4bn4.20% HNB PLC17.1bn3.60% PABC PLC1.3bn1.60% UBC PLC447.5mn1.00% DFCC PLC1.4bn0.90% NTB PLC558mn0.60%
Commercial Bank PLC1.953bn0.40%
NDB PLC224.8mn0.10% SME Sector emphasis
Currently, the banking sector overlooks the SME sector due to its inherent credit risk associated due to lack of asset base to provide asset backed lending. However, government’s initiative to implement credit guarantee schemes from 2016 onwards with an allocation of Rs 500 mn to selected financial institutions to recover 75.0% of the principal amount in case of default and obtaining US$ 100mn from ADB to support lending to SMEs will increase the focus of banks and financial institutions towards SMEs.
Therefore, we see this as a positive development towards the SMEs which represent 80.0% of the registered businesses.
We see prospects for counters such as Sanasa Development Bank, Bimputh, and Commercial Credit who are currently focused on to this sector.
Proposed mergers
*HDFC + State Mortgage and Investment Bank = National Housing Bank *Lankaputhra + Regional Development bank = Lanka Enterprise Bank *Savings Bank + NSB = NSB *Divineguma Bank + NSB = NSB
We believe this consolidation largely comprising of state owned banks will be more streamlined and will be appositive development towards the financial sector of Sri Lanka. However, this will create competition for the listed counters going forward.
Others developments
Employees receive salaries through bank accounts. This will increase the deposit base of banks which we see as a positive development.
Bank draft chargers to be reduced from Rs 250 to Rs 150. This will limit the fee and commission income prospects of banks.
Removal of Stamp duty on credit card for local purchases. We expect this to promote the credit card usage in the economy and to facilitate the expansion of fee and commission based income.
Return on cheques to be considered a serious offence – This will promote timely depositing of cash and maintaning cash balances in current accounts. As a result, this will promote CASA ratio of banks further to result in increase NIMs.
Measures to promote banking accounts for children will further strengthen the NIMs of banks with the ability to increase the low cost deposit mobilization.
Allowing local companies to borrow from international Banks – We see this to impact corporate banking activities of the banks with increased competition setting in from International banks being allowed to fund directly to local companies.
Removal of WHT of 2.5% - We expect this development to promote a savings culture in the economy. As a result, this will increase the deposit mobilization of banks overall. Further, this will increase low cost funding such as savings and will reduce the need of the banks to borrow further.
To impose the cap on interest rates offered by finance companies – This will enable to regulate the finance companies. However, this will have an impact on the potential for earnings growth and we see an impact on all listed finance companies.
Restriction on lending to unsuspecting borrowers - We see this as a positive development which will enable the overall finance industry NPLs to reduce with increased pressure on borrowing conditions.
Investors allowed to bring in money to any bank account – This development will certainly benefit the banks to increase deposit mobilization.
Proposal to maintain a dedicated bank account for each company for government related payments. We believe this will also increase the deposit mobilization and increase the CASA ratios.
Initiative to set up an EXIM bank - We perceive this as a negative development towards listed banking and finance counters in the CSE, as this will set in more competition and reduce earnings prospects.
Initiatives taken to reduce cost of living by bring won prices of essentials and further easing the cost of living for people and increasing PAYE to higher cap of LKR2.4mn, will increase saving levels in the economy. Therefore, we expect increased deposit mobilization of banks and finance companies. Also, on the other hand, personal loans demanded in the economy will also reduce.
Initiative taken to remove import taxes on gold and further issuing 50 import licenses will promote gold as an investment commodity in the economy from a domestic level. We believe this will have an impact on the level of savings in the economy and resulting impact in the deposit mobilization of banks.
Proposed to develop International Finance Center in Colombo with a 30,000 sq ft area. We believe this will increase the free flow of funding and expansion of the financial system in the economy which will in return, the growth prospects of the banking and finance sector.
Allowing the foreigners to borrow 40.0% of their investments in condominiums from banks in local currency – This will positively affect the local banking and finance industry.
Taxation
The applicable corporate tax has been increased from 28.0% to 30.0% for the banking and financing sector.
The NBT has been expanded from the current 2.0% to 4.0%. This will inevitably, reduce earnings potential in terms of transaction volumes for the banks and finance companies.
We expect this to reduce the prospects for a bottom line expansion in the short to medium term.
Insurance
The new requirement of the insurance companies to issue medical insurance covers up to the age of 75 will increase the claims ratio, and will have a downward pressure on the thin profits currently enjoyed by the insurance industry as a whole.
Proposed initiative to provide health insurance schemes by EPF will reduce the demand made for life insurance policies. We perceive this also as a negative for the listed counters.
The applicable corporate tax has been increased from 28.0% to 30.0% for the insurance sector.
We expect this to reduce the prospects for a bottom line expansion in the short to medium term.
Beverage, Food and Tobacco Sector
We believe reduced prices of essentials and initiatives taken to reduce FMCG products for the benefit of consumers from the 2016 budget to positively impact BFT counters, with increased demand setting in and resulting volume driven performance.
Proposals that affect FMCG companies positively
*To reduce the Special Commodity Levy (SCL) of potatoes by Rs 25/- per kilogram. Accordingly, it is expected to provide a price ranging from Rs 75/- to 85/- for a kilogram of potatoes for the consumers
*To reduce the SCL for big onions by Rs 25/- and to provide consumers with a price ranging from Rs 85/- to 95/- per a kilogram of big onions.
*To reduce the price of a 400 gram packet of locally manufactured milk powder to Rs 295/- and in order to cover the loss incurred by the local milk powder manufacturer, the Government will provide a subsidy of Rs 30/-
*To reduce price of infant milk powder by Rs 100/- per kilo.
*To reduce the price of a canned fish tin of 425 grams to Rs 125/-. Accordingly, to provide a subsidy of Rs 15/- for a canned fish tin of 425 grams.
*To limit the maximum retail price of Sprats to Rs 410/- per kilogram.
*To implement a maximum retail price of Rs 169/- per kilo of dhal
*To impose a maximum retail price of Rs 1,100/- for a kilo of “Katta”
*To impose a maximum retail price of Rs 425/- for a dried fish kilo of “Salaya”
*To impose a maximum retail price of Rs 169/- for a kilo of chick pea
We expect these developments to promote increase consumption and also promote the per capita purchasing power to result in increased volumes.
Granting depreciation on machinery and reduction of taxes associated with machinery used in the dairy industry – This will be beneficial for counters mainly into the dairy industries NEST, Lanka Milk Foods, Lucky Lanka Milk, and Renuka Foods.
SCL imposed on fish imported will most likely positively contribute towards the business development of canned fish manufacturers such as Renuka Foods and Tess Agro.
Taxation -FMCG
The applicable corporate tax has been decreased from 28.0% to 15.0% for the FMCG sector counters such as CCS, CARG, RICH, COCO, NEST, Keells Foods Products, Bairaha Farms, Convenience Foods etc. We expect this to increase the prospects for a bottom line expansion in the short to medium term.
Liquor and Tobacco
*Reduction of corporate tax from 40.0% to 30.0%
*Introduction of Surtax at a rate of 25.0% on the income tax liability
*Beedi manufacturing License fee will be increased from LKR1,500/- to LKR5,000/-
*Increasing the manufacturing license fee of Distilleries to LKR150mn
*Excise duty of LKR250mn per month
*Custom duties to be revised and tax on imported foreign liquor imported to be increased
We gather that these developments will have an adverse effect on the bottom line expansion of DIST, CTC, LION and BREW.
Retail and trading
VAT imposed on wholesale and retail trade has been proposed to be removed. We believe that counters which has exposure to retrial and trading such as CARG, JKH, and RICH will benefit going forward, with increased volumes.
Apparels
Revised import taxes on garment, shoes and accessories with the view of developing Sri Lanka as a shopping destination.
We believe high end retail counters such as ODEL, SHL to benefit. However, income tax has been increased to 30.0% from 28.0%.
Manufacturing
It was proposed to ban all used consumer capital goods such as TVs, washing machines etc. from 1ST January 2016. This will increase the demand for consumer goods. Also it was proposed to reduce PAL Tax on consumer electronics. Additionally these industry tax rates applicable for manufacturers of these goods were reduced to 15.0% from 28.0%, while companies that are involved in trading of these goods will face an increase in taxes from 28.0% to 30.0%.
We believe this development to go favorable for Regnis and Singer Industries.
Tile and ceramic
* Tile, clay and sanitary wear removed from the BOI negative list
* Reduced taxes for importation
We believe counters that are directly into tile and sanitary manufacturing such as Lanka Tiles, Lanka Walltiles, Royal Ceramics would face price based competition from cheap imports particularly from China.
Therefore, we see limited profit prospects for this sector in the forthcoming period.
Chicken
*To promote local industries of Chicken
*To increased investments to promote local industry
*Export markets – utmost assistance promised
*Maximum retail prices were increased to LKR400 and LKR480 (without skin)
We believe this development would go in favour for counters such as Bairaha, and counters that are operating in the upper tiers of the value chain such as three acre farms and Ceylon Grain elevators and CIC.
Motors Proposals
*To introduce a simple unit rate of excise duty for the vehicles on the basis of cubic centimeters. Duties on the percentage basis on certain vehicles will also be revised.
*A fee on valuation certificates obtainable for finance facilities will be charged: - Three wheeler/Motor Cycle - LKR5,000. All other vehicles - LKR25,000/- with effect from January 1, 2016.
*Unregistered vehicles to be registered before 31/03/2016: Such vehicles could be registered by paying the following fee to RMV: - Cars/ Vans - Rs.01 Mn - Other vehicles - Rs.0.75 Mn
*A fee will be imposed in lieu of ‘Motor Vehicle Importers Registration fee’ with effect from January 1, 2016 - Motor Cycle/three wheelers- Rs.2,000/- Motor Cars - Rs.15,000/-
*Emission Levy – The levy is payable at the point of renewal of annual license on every motor vehicle which is over 03 years at the rate of Rs 5,000/- per year
*To reduce Excise duty to 2.5% for the vehicles which are run entirely on Solar, Hydrogen or Helium.
These developments will result in contracting the vehicle importation and registration market which expanded quite aggressively during the 1st 11 months of 2015.
Therefore, we believe counters such as DIMO, UML, Sathosa Motors, Colonial Motors to have a contraction in profits reported in the forthcoming period.
Hotels sector
Proposals
*Tourism Development Levy will be removed.
*Plans to promote Bentota, Colombo Fort, Mirissa and Galle as tourist destinations – Rs 500mn allocation
*Promotion of the medical tourism – legislation for this industry
*Exhibition centers to be established
*Need for registration of all hotels in the Tourist Development Board to be registered in order to obtain a star category (60% hotels not registered)
*LKR100 million would be allocated as a start to train workers through a public private partnership.
*New tax structure to make a ‘shopping paradise’ on several items that will have lower import duties
We believe in the short to medium term, none of the proposed initiatives will have a direct impact on the listed counters that are into hospitality and tourism.
Plantations Sector - Proposals
*To promote all regional plantation
companies to get listed on CSE
*To promote recultivation
*A restructuring committee to look after the plantation companies – a special report will be issued
*Profits and income from the cultivation of tea or rubber by any plantation company, of which the Government shareholding is in existence, will be exempted for a period of 2 years commencing from April 1, 2016.
Tea
*Not enough value addition
*Blending and value adding behind Dubai
*Positioning SL as a Tea blending country
*A new committee appointed to increase the value addition
*To rebrand “Ceylon Tea” – compulsory
*Cultivation companies to get 2 year
tax holidays
*Coco, tea, rubber (research sectors – LKR200mn for 2 years)
*Two year tax exemption for Tea and Rubber growers to incentivise
Rubber
*Technology subsidies are looked at
*LKR100mn will be allocated for development of the industry
Coconut
*LKR250mn allocation Other crops
*Arecanut – promotion of commercial cultivation
*Arecanut collection centers
*Value added Erica nuts to be developed for exports
*Planting corporation support
The proposed developments are more towards survival of the industry than for an expansion Therefore, we do not foresee any contribution to the plantation companies listed.
Chemicals and Pharmaceuticals Sector - Proposals
* Custom Duty will be revised on Agriculture machinery and equipment
*A reduction of 50% of the tax payable on the profits from the locally developed seeds and planting materials for a period of 5 years.
*A reduction of 50% of the tax payable on the profits from agriculture by a company using drip irrigation method, greenhouse technology and high yielding seeds for a period of 5 years.
*The triple deduction for Research and Development expenses will be allowed only if a technology advancement and yield development is proved
We believe this will have a favorable impact on CIC in the medium term, with fertilizer and seed business.
Lubricants and bitumen- Proposals
*Liberalize the lubricant market and liberalize the bitumen segment in Sri Lanka
*Plans to remove lubricants from BOI negative list
*To promote new production
*Reduce the tax rate by 50.0% - for 1 year capital nature to bring investments into the lubricants sector
Proposal to liberalize lubricants can be seen as favourable from consumers’ point of view when the motor vehicle market has expanded quite rapidly in the recent past. However, this will trigger price competition to the 2 large players mainly Chevron and LIOC. This will have a direct impact on the bottom line in the forthcoming period, with reduced profits.
Liberalizing the bitumen industry will increase the current no. of players largely limited to two. This will have a direct impact on growth and profit prospects of LIOC.
Power and Energy Sector
Proposals -Bunkering
*Increased participation of the private sector encouraged for deep sea bunkering
*Hambantota land to be allocated for ship building an repairing activities
We identify this to have direct impact on LIOC as bunkering was seen as a main sector that generated revenue and profits to the company in the recent past.
Power
*Power and energy developed in line with the Megapolis concept in cities
*Eco friendly power generation
*More emphasis on solar power generation and other renewables
*Expenditure for solar power by houses – qualified payment for tax purposes
*Investments into generation activities will be allowed without any restrictions
*Letters of Intent issued by the CEB for Non-Conventional Renewable Energy projects (NCRE) that has already been issued but unutilized for more than 1 year as at 31. December, 2015 will cease to be operational.
Price of a 12.5kg of LPG gas cylinder by LKR150, with immediate effect – We expect this to have a negative bearing on LGL by exerting pressure on their gross profit margins.
Telecommunications Sector - Proposals
Telecommunication Levies
* International Telecommunication Operators Levy (ITOL) on incoming calls will be increased US$ Cents 9 to US$ Cents 12.
* Environmental Fee will be charged per tower at the rate of Rs.50,000/- per annum.
* Cess levied at 2% for international transit traffic will be exempted
* Exemptions for NBT will be removed
We believe these proposed initiatives will have a negative impact on the 2 large players namely Dialog and SLT, with increased costs going forward.
Construction Sector- Proposals
* One section of the central expressway allocated to local contractors.
* Housing sector to be made self sufficient
* Megapolis concept to be implemented
* Foreign contractors should work with local partners to increase experience and knowledge
* Deep sea sand to be accessed with machinery which are imported on a duty free basis
* To allocate Rs.1,000 million in 2016 as seed capital of the proposed public private partnership, “Infrastructure Development Authority” (IDA) to expand the Central Expressway to connect Dambulla, Polonnaruwa, Mullaitvu and Jaffna
* It is also proposed to provide guarantees to the IDA , should the company be engaged in raising debt finance domestically or internationally.
* Constructing a new access road from the Kelani Bridge to the Colombo Fort improving access to Fort. - to allocate a sum of Rs.4,000 million to be utilized within a period of 2 years.
* To construct an elevated road from Cotta Road to Kaduwela on BOT basis. - to commit a sum of Rs.10,000 million
* To allocate Rs. 15,000 million for the expansion of the road network which includes the expansion of the Ruwanpura Expressway, extension of Marine drive up to Panadura, extension of the Pamankada - Ratmalana Road, new bridge construction over the Kelani River, reconstruction of 25 bridges and 3 flyovers.
These increased infrastructure development projects proposed will be beneficial for the 2 large construction counters namely Access Engineering and MTD Walkers. Therefore, we believe these 2 counters will have the project pipelines filled going forward with the increased emphasis on infrastructure development
Land and Property Sector
Land (Restriction on Alienation) Act
* Restriction on transfer will be removed for certain identified investments
* Tax on leasing of lands will be removed
*Allowing the foreigners to borrow 40.0% of their investments in condominiums from banks in local currency
*Mansion tax will be removed from condominiums.
These relaxing of rules with regard to land and property, will increase the prospects for property sector counters particularly to OSEA, which is currently attractive in this sector.
