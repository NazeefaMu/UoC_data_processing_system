1990 Emergency ambulance service now islandwide

The 1990 Emergency Ambulance Service, which expanded island-wide recently under Indian grant assistance, is now available in seven provinces.
The service has been available in Northern Province since July; in Uva since August; in North Central Province since September; in North Western Province since October; and Central Province since November 2018. The service will also be available in the other 2 Provinces (Sabaragamuwa and Eastern Province) soon.
At the request of Government of Sri Lanka, the service was initially launched in 2016 in Western and Southern Provinces of Sri Lanka under an Indian grant of USD 7.56 million. This grant included purchase of 88 ambulances, operational expenditure of the service for one year and setting up of an emergency response Centre.
The service, can be obtained by simply dialing toll free number ‘1990’ on any network in Sri Lanka. It is the largest Indian grant project in Sri Lanka after the Indian Housing Project.
