Propagating benefits of good governance to outside world

The book Buddhist Ideals of Good Governance authored by Prof. Francois Chenet and Ven. Dr. Tampalawela Dhammaratana Thera of the Paris-Sorbonne University in France on the invitation of President Maithripala Sirisena on how the Buddha’s teachings and guidance can help the process of good governance, will be launched on January 16 at Water’s Edge, Battaramulla.
The book will be useful to world leaders and others interested in the principles of good governance.
Parliamentary Reforms and Mass Media Ministry Secretary Nimal Bopage addressing a media briefing at the ministry yesterday, said the new book will highlight the teachings of the Buddha on good governance during his time to emphasise human dignity, human rights, peace, justice, religious and cultural reconciliation and social and economic sustainable prosperity.
The main aim of this endeavour is to propagate the benefits of good governance to the outside world, he said.
Bopage said Ven. Dr. Tampalawela Dhammaratana Thera was born in a remote area in Bibile and obtained higher education at the Kelaniya University and has been living in France for the past 30 years.
The thera followed his PHD studies at the Sorbonne University in France. During President Sirisena’s visit to France in November 2015, he requested the thera to write a book on the values of good governance as reflected through the Buddha and the Dhamma, Bopage said.
The thera compiled this book in collaboration with senior professor of Sorbonne University, Francois Chenet. This book shows how world leaders can govern their countries by adhering to the Buddhist philosophy, he said.
Bopage said on the day of the launching of the book, a trust fund titled ‘Nidahase Maithree Daruwo' will be launched with the help of philanthropists.
A deed of the trust fund will be handed over to the President. Over 1,200 children born on January 8, 2015 will receive scholarships from grade one to university level. Children with economic issues and various ailments will also receive donations in the future, he said.
In addition, a draft paper on the establishment of the global centre of studies and research on good governance will also be presented to the President.
International Institute of Buddhist Studies of Paris Director and Buddhist Liaison Officer to UNESCO, Ven. Dr. Tampalawela Dhammaratana Thera said President Sirisena was making a great effort to create a just society through a good governance concept based on the teachings of the Buddha.
"This is why I accepted his invitation. The whole world including the UN firmly believes that only the Buddha’s philosophy has the answer to the problems of the people and governments. The Buddha has stated about good governance through Dasaraja Dhamma sermons. The entire world is facing various war and tragedies and world leaders are also facing problems due to this, he said.
"The world has accepted that only the Buddha’s teachings can show us the way to deal with these problems. Following the Buddha’s philosophy will be a great consolation for world leaders to solve their problems and this book will benefit them,” he added.
