President throws challenge to debate reports before LG polls

President Maitiripala Sirisena yesterday said that those who were demanding to bring the Presidential Commission reports in Parliament ran away from the debate on these reports.
He challenged them to have the debate on the revelations of these reports before the upcoming Local Government election.
Opposition politicians were clamouring for parliamentary debates on these Presidential Commission reports including the report of Central Bank Bond issue until they were tabled in parliament. “These while collar thieves have grouped themselves to prevent these reports from being debated in parliament,” he said.
“These rogues in unison have got the debate on these reports postponed till the end of February.
The President said these rogues will be exposed, once these reports are debated in parliament.
The President was addressing an election rally in Panadura yesterday to ensure the victory of the UPFA candidates vying for the local government bodies in the Kalutara district.
“We have begun a national campaign to ensure a clean and corruption free politics for the country. While collar thieves who are against these moves are grouping themselves”, he said.
“Former President Mahinda Rajapaksa was not in parliament to vote for the no confidence motion brought in against former Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayake. The former President had said that he did not bring a no confidence motion against Karunanayake. I will today show you the parliament Hansard which records the no confidence debate and the vote”, he said.
President Maithripala Sirisena said that former President Rajapaksa had phoned Ravi Karunanayake soon after the debate and the vote on the no confidence motion in parliament.
