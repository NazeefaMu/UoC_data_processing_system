A true smile makes the world go round in Style

You have to really empathize with people holding demanding service industry jobs. Thousands of you are hard working skilled employees or professionals who are occupied in stressful and exactingoccupations. But all you folks have it easy compared with the poor souls who, despite being paid miserable wages and measly benefits, are required to smile all day.
Although I have done my share of public relations stints I have never been pressed to keep smiling until my gritted teeth hurt. If I would have had to suffer such pressures I certainly would have provided any such demanders with an un-clinical example of free dentistry.That is why I really pity all those people engaged in the service industry whose job compels them to flash a smile at every potential customer.
Adaptable and appropriate
For those in hospitality, airline, retail and most any service industry, I would not like to be in your shoes, and ‘walk the talk’ in such testing vocations. In effect, let me assure all you servers out there that I feel your pain.
A smile can communicate a surfeit of various meanings. But that again would depend on the type of smile and how it is taken to mean. People normally figure out the intimation of a smile since it was a considerable design for survival. Throughout the ages it revealed to the recipient if the smile was one of sarcasm or genuine friendship.
Some read a smile as an intimation of delight, others as a grin of annoyance or irritability. History has proved that certain such interpretations of smiles, whether rightly or wrongly construed, have diplomatically averted potential skirmishes or encouraged the start of armed conflicts. As the woman of the century Mother Teresa so succinctly put it: “Peace begins with a smile.”
It is true that people smile for varied reasons. There is a specific something within the customary expressive smile which makes it adaptable and appropriate in various circumstances. Everyone knows that a power of an endearing smile could ease tensions in the most explosive situations and get you out of even the most troubled encounters.
We all use a variance of smiles in our everyday dealings. Perceptibly, it is the rudimentary type of smile which is known as a ‘happy smile.’ Such a smile is genuinely straightforward and engaging and easy to recognise by most. It clearly expresses that the ‘smiler’ is delighted or appreciative over a pleasurable encounter. It is usually a demonstration or acceptance of kindness, love, happiness or simply being appreciative of the presence of the company.
A diminutive gleam
Then there is also the shamefaced or embarrassed smile. This routinely occurs when we make a blunder or drop a clanger that would prove discomfiting to the people you are having a discussion with. The sheepish smile is meant to take the edge off your bungle or omission and attempts to stir a more benign response by the affronted party.
There is again the attentive smile. This is a diminutive gleam on the face of listeners which give the impression that they are all ears to the conversation. In stark contrast is the devious or deceitful grin which is known as the fake or forged smirk.
This specific sneer could be baiting or unctuous and extremely questionable because it could create a great deal of misunderstanding.
The social smile is intended to exhibit respect, dependability, honesty and openness. People usually flash this smile when they come across people for the first time at a social event. As most great marketers would tell you, retail is part selling and part psychology and in this case it is true for both shoppers and employees. People are sometimes offended by the type of a smile that one makes even though one is not willing to smile. Meaning it is not a spontaneous smile and can be construed as forced, unnatural or mechanical.
No, I am not an anti-smiling lobbyist. I know smiling helps your immune system. Yes it does release endorphins, the body’s natural painkillers. Still, I have learnt from experience that if a man smiles all the time, he is probably selling something that does not work. As someone, probably a conman so aptly said: “A smile is an effective way to get out of trouble, even if it happens to be a fake one.” Now, don’t get me wrong. I am not saying you should not smile if you feel like smiling. No one wants to be around a ‘moosala’ personality who constantly wears a hangdog expression. Neither am I suggesting walking around grinning at people all day. That would be more likely to make someone suspicious that you are a grinning idiot rather than helping lift their spirits.
Positively affecting
But psychologists recommend a smile, even if it is a sad smile, because sadder than a sad smile is the sadness of not knowing how to smile. And yes, we all have our bad days. But no matter how hard it is, smiling has been proven to make a person happier. As another wit said: “Use your smile to change the world. Don’t let the world change your smile.”
Humour is infectious and a smile is the prelude to laughter. The sound of roaring laughter is far more contagious than any cough, sneeze or yawn. When laughter is shared, it unites people and increases joy and intimacy. Laughter also triggers healthy physical changes in the body. Humour and a smile which lead up to laughter toughen your immune system, enhance your energy, lessen pain and protect you from the harmful effects of stress. Best of all, this precious remedy is enjoyable, is on the house and has no side effects.
And whether you are interacting with a co-worker, a shop assistant or a check-out cashier, a simple smile can go a long way towards making a person feel appreciated. It turns out, that smiles are also contagious and capable of positively affecting our own moods. Flash a smile, and chances are you will get one in return.
I know at times it can seem impossible, but even forcing a smile can make you feel a little better. And you will definitely feel better when your smiles are reciprocated by happy customers. But a genuine smile, one that comes from the heart, is a gift. It simply cannot be bought, begged, borrowed or badgered.
So you see, in all these service industries as well as in the world’s political and diplomatic firmament there is no doubt that the majority of them simply fake it. I mean they have a plastered almost permanent beam on their mugs that seem to have been passed through a strainer. But a real smile is a curve that usually sets things right even in the most volatile situations. [email protected]
