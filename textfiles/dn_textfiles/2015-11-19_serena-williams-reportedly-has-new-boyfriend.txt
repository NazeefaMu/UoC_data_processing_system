Serena Williams reportedly has new boyfriend

Serena Williams reportedly has a new high profile millionaire boyfriend, and it isn't Drake, who was widely blamed for her US Open loss.
Us Weekly reports that Williams is dating Reddit co-founder Alexis Ohanian.
"They met at a lunch," a source said. "It's new."
The magazine reported that Williams, 34, and Ohanian, 32, were spotted working out together in Los Angeles earlier this week.
"He called her babe and they held hands," a source said. However, Ohanian is not a huge tennis fan.
"He said he'd never been into tennis until they started dating!" the course continued.
Williams had been rumoured to be dating Canadian rapper, Drake, who was present at many of her games leading up to the US Open, where Williams had the chance to become the first player in 27 years to win a calendar grand slam.
However, she lost in the semi-finals to Italian Roberta Vinci.
The internet turned on rumoured-boyfriend, Drake, accusing him of taking Williams' focus away from her job.
