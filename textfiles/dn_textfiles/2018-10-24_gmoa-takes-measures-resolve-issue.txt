Rajarata University’s Medical Faculty :
GMOA takes measures to resolve issue

The Government Medical Officers’ Association (GMOA) will take several steps to address the issue of the Medical Faculty of Rajarata University, GMOA Secretary Dr. Haritha Aluthge said.
Speaking at a press conference at the GMOA headquarters in Colombo yesterday morning, he said the Anuradhapura branch of the GMOA has already been informed of the issue and it will hold a discussion with the Medical Faculty Lecturers’ Union and report back to the Executive Committee on possible solutions.
In addition, the GMOA will inform the Vice Chancellor and administration of Rajarata University to solve the issue as soon as possible.
The issue has already been brought to the notice of the Higher Education Minister Wijeyedasa Rajapakshe over the telephone and arrangements will be made to meet him and find a solution in the next few days, Dr. Aluthge said.
The GMOA will also inform President Maithripala Sirisena about the importance of formulating a strategy to increase the standard of medical education and encourage professionals to remain in the country, without going abroad for better pay and benefits, he said.
