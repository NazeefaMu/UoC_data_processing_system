Dwellings Group opens opportunity to local investors to Melbourne ‘661 Chapel St.’ apartments

Dwellings Group once again offers value for money alongside a luxurious urban lifestyle, set in a stunning location. Developed by Malaysian public listed developer Gamuda Land and located in Melbourne’s 661, Chapel St., this latest 30-storied new high rise is scheduled to be ready by the 1st quarter of 2018
Residential sales of its apartments have commenced and investors have the opportunity now to customize their requirements. Prestige buyers can buy individual apartments or buy entire floors.
Dwellings Group are specialists in signature-living property investments and experts in property sales and management with a portfolio of successful projects in Australia and Sri Lanka.
With an opulent luxury-hotel-style entrance and art gallery, 661, Chapel St. is situated in a shopping, dining and entertainment precinct in Melbourne.
It has myriad shops ranging from exclusive upmarket fashion designers at the South Yarra end to trendy retailers and eateries in Windsor. This high-rise residency overlooks a panoramic landscape of the neighbor-hood with the equally impressive lower levels enjoying the soothing sights of the Yarra river.
661 Chapel St. is designed by renowned architects Bird de la Coeur and is the first in the world that enables residents to enter through a covered gateway cobbled in bluestone leading to a grand lobby with a concierge.
A cantilevered 25-metre lap pool is designed to hang over the entrance, while a bold lighting installation of suspended orbs by Israeli artist Omer Arbel, creates a focal point in the grand entrance hallway. Another luxury touch is the ground-floor art space, which will include sculptural pieces by French crystal brand Lalique, including a collaboration with English artist Damien Hirst.
Director of Dwellings Group Navin De Silva said, “We appreciate the importance of developing long-term relationships with each of our clients, wherever they are on their property journey.”
“ We understand that every area, every property and every client is different and that one size doesn’t fit all, so while many agents focus purely on their sales processes, exceptional agencies like Dwellings also focus on people and on delivering a truly excellent service to each and every one of its clients.
That is why we employ some of the most experienced and most qualified agents in the industry and have our service regularly recognized by industry awards.”
