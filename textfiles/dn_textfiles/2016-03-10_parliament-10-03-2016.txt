Govt allocated Rs. 9,055 m to stabilize tea, rubber prices
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe told Parliament yesterday that the government had allocated Rs. 9,055 million to stabilize the prices of tea and rubber in 2015.
He was responding to question raised by UPFA MP Mahinda Yapa Abeywardene during the Prime Minister's question time.
The Prime Minister said the government would initiate a systematic programme to improve tea and rubber cultivations in the near future.
Commodity prices have come down throughout the world and subsequently tea and rubber prices too had come down. The Middle East is a biggest buyer for Sri Lankan tea. Russia and Ukraine which used to be the biggest buyers of Sri Lanka tea, are not buying our tea at the moment.
The present fertilizer requirement of the country is 870,000 tones. We will convene both state and private stakeholders to take a decision on fertilizer shortly. A new programme too would be implemented to revive the tea industry. Some relief had to be provided to this industry and we are looking into to exactly which section of the tea industry should get this relief. We have also paid attention to protect tea small holders.

Country needs constitution that recognises rights of Sri Lankans
Minister of Justice and Buddha Sasana Wijeyadasa Rajapaksa told Parliament yesterday, that what Sri Lanka needed now was a profound multi ethnic, multi religious and multi language Constitution that recognizes the rights of all Sri Lankans to live in peaceful and coexistence in this island.
The minister commencing the debate on the Resolution to appoint a Constitutional Assembly for the second allocated day, said that no one likes to be controlled by another one. All the people however, like to be treated equally under the law. The people also expects the law makers and rulers should also respect the same law.
Earlier, it was the ruler of the country who was the most powerful under the existing Constitution. The 1978 Constitution did not create a stable and strong government as former President J.R. Jayawardene envisaged. It was formulated without obtaining public views and ideas.
This made the Executive Presidency stronger and the powers of Parliament weaker. When the Executive Presidency turned into dictatorship, those powers could not be curbed by Parliament or by the Judiciary. Only the people force could topple the powers of the Executive Presidency. That was the change which took place on January 8 in this country.
After the new government came into the power, it had been able to curtail most of the powers of the Executive Presidency by bringing 19th Amendment. No party claimed ownership of the proposed new Constitution, as it was a joint effort of all political parties, based on the opinions and views of the general public.

Only Finance Companies pay 15 percent interest'
Only finance companies provide 15 percent interest rate on senior citizens' deposits upto Rs. 1.5 million, Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayake said in Parliament yesterday.
He was responding to a question raised by JVP MP Bimal Rathnayake. The minister explaining the matter, said this budgetary proposal was not operative in state banks or private banks. He noted the said budgetary proposal had been implemented by the Government only through licensed finance companies registered under the Central Bank.
The minister said the Government accepted the responsibility on the safety of these deposits, adding that the Central Bank would streamline and restructure the finance companies in the country.
"The interest rates in finance companies stand at 11-12 percent, while these rates in private banks are only 7-8 percent. When this scheme is implemented through finance companies, the amount the Government has to pay becomes less," he said. However, Chief Opposition Whip Anura Kumara Dissanayake and MP Bimal Rathnayake, questioned as to how the Government could guarantee the safety of deposits in these private financial institutions, as there were past experiences on the collapse of some of these institutions, which had been recognized by the Central Bank.
They also pointed out that it was unfair that the Government limited this proposal to the deposits in finance companies, as those companies did not have islandwide branches. "This inconveniences senior citizens. We urge the Government to include state and private banks too in this scheme.
"The people have much faith in state banks and private banks," they said.
However, the minister said that 65 percent of the deposits in the country are in finance companies, adding that this shows that there is no credibility issue in them. He said there are 54 finance companies in the country and the Government would lift up the credibility of finance companies in par with state banks.
