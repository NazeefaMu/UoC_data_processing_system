‘SL - China ties strong despite New York Times allegations’

Diplomatic ties between Sri Lanka and China are strong despite various allegations levelled against them in the New York Times article on the Hambantota Port, said Co-Cabinet Spokesperson Minister Rajitha Senaratne, yesterday.
Answering questions on whether diplomatic ties have been strained between the government and China due to the article, Minister Senaratne insisted that allegations of bribery were against a Chinese company and not against the Chinese government.
The New York Times article had alleged that China Harbour Engineering Company had paid USD 7.6 million to fund former President Mahinda Rajapaksa’s 2014 Presidential campaign. The article also alleged that through their support of the former President and the granting of loans on high interest rates, the Chinese company had forced the Sri Lankan government into giving them the Hambantota Port.
The minister, addressing the weekly Cabinet media briefing at the Parliament complex, said government MPs too should refrain from criticising the Chinese government.
In 2015, the CID started investigations into the dealings between the Chinese company and the former President but the minister said he did not know the current status of those investigations. He, however, stated that there were 16 active investigations against Rajapaksa. Three had been filed in court and Rajapaksa had appealed against them. The rest are yet to be filed in court.
The Prime Minister, meanwhile, informed Parliament yesterday that the CID would begin investigations into the complaint made by Deputy Minister Ranjan Ramanayake against former President Mahinda Rajapaksa with evidence based on the New York Times article.
