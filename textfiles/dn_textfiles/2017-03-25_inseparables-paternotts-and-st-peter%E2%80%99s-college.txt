The Inseparables the Paternotts and St. Peter’s College

The Paternotts and St Peter’s College, Bambalapitiya are almost synonymous with each other for when one talks of the sporting achievements of the school especially at cricket and rugby you cannot leave the name of Paternott out.
The Paternotts have a unique history with St Peter’s and what better way to introduce it than to say that Norman Paternott was the first cricket captain of the school from 1927 to 1930 and that he was also the school’s first Head Prefect.
The 1968 Peterite cricket team captained by Rodney Paternott (fourth from left).
Thirty-eight years later Rodney Paternott followed in his father’s footsteps by captaining St Peter’s at cricket in 1968 and his younger brother Hamish at rugby in 1970. Rodney belongs to a unique sextet of Peterites who have captained the school at cricket as well as rugby.
The six in order are: Shirley Illesinghe, Percy Perera, Jayantha Fernando, Adiel Anghie, Darrel Wimlaratne and Rodney Paternott. Of this unique honours list the only surviving captain is Rodney with the rest having passed away.
“I am hoping to come next year to celebrate 50 years as Peterite cricket captain,” said Rodney. “I captained St Peter’s at rugby in 1967 and cricket in 1968. We are trying to have a reunion of the 1968 cricket team. I think except for one, all the cricketers are alive, half of them are in Sri Lanka and the others in Australia.”
Rodney was recently in Sri Lanka where he had come down for the celebration of the old boys’ global reunion more or less leading towards the countdown for the school’s 100th year which falls in another five years.
“The school is 95 years old and most of us may not be there for the Centenary, so we take every year as it comes,” Rodney told the ‘Daily News’.
“The old boys union celebrated 90 years and they had a big do. Everyday there was some function we had a reunion of the past cricketers Josephians and Peterites. I was there for the Big Match as well, it was my first Big Match since I left for Australia in 1984. I’ve come to Sri Lanka many times since migrating but not during the big match. My last visit to Sri Lanka was five years ago,” he said.
Rodney’s immediate families are all overseas in Melbourne and when he comes to Sri Lanka he visits his cousins and relations.
Rolling back the years Rodney recalled, “Darrel (Wimalaratne) and I played cricket for CCC and rugby for CH&FC. For CH I first played as fly half then moved to centre with Darrel. In the 1972 season we beat every club home and away except for the Police. We lost to them in the very first match but beat them in the return. We were the league champions but we lost the Clifford Cup final to Police.
“My first captain at CH was an Englishman Morris Marrinon he was our no. 8, there was also Lorenz Pereira as fly half and late Horace Perera. My idol was John Burrows, he was magic. If I learnt anything in rugby I learnt it from watching him. A man of a few words but got what he wanted.
“In my eyes Mike Cork, an Englishman who played for CH was the fastest. He was a wing three-quarter and very close to him will be Chandrishan Perera on the wing. Both guys were like lightning. Cork had no idea of rugby but he learnt it on the field. He ran in the British Empire Games. It is unfortunate that Mike and Chandrishan never played together. Mike played in 1972 and Chandrishan came about three to four years later.”
While in Sri Lanka, Rodney also took time to watch a few school rugby matches.
“I watched the Royal-Peterite match, Royal deserved to win because they played a better brand of rugby. The second game was Peterites playing Isipathana. The Peterites came off well. The school standards have always been high. I have not seen the club games yet. But the school standards have really gone up they will give any of the schools in Melbourne a good run,” said Rodney.
Comparing the game during his time and now, Rodney said, “It’s become more physical, very fast and the game pattern has changed. It has improved in a lot of ways. We had a lot of open play. I was really taken up by the present school standards. The crowd factor is really fantastic.”
Rodney was of the opinion that Sevens rugby suited the Lankan style of play.
“We should do well with our Sevens it suits our style of play. In Sevens you cannot miss, you need to have possession and if you don’t you need to tackle. Sevens is mainly about size and speed. We have speed but we don’t have much of the size so you have to compensate for it by tackling.”

Paying a visit to the Gymkhana Club (comprises CCC, CH&FC and Queen’s Club) Rodney was saddened by what the club had to offer today.
“It’s disappointing to see CH today this club meant a lot to me, it was like my second home. Every day of the week I was at CH we had a good time with the Pink Elephants (a team comprising past and present players). It’s very disappointing to hear that CH rugby has declined so much. When I told some of my friends that I wanted my grandson to come and play a couple of seasons for CH, I was told not to put him at CH but at some other club,” said Rodney who has two grandsons, the eldest Aaron who is 18 and plays for the seniors as half back.
Looking around the club Rodney observed that there was no past champion team photographs hanging on the walls or any past captain’s names on the honours board.
“I hope they put them back in a prominent place and not in a corner where no one will see. You like to see your past chairman’s photographs and past captains names on the board in cricket and rugby for which this club is famous for,” said Rodney.
He also had another sad story to relate with regard to the club.
“It is disappointing to note that we are over 150 years old and I read a magazine that had been put out for the Centenary year that does not mention the very first team that played in the Sara trophy tournament,” said Rodney.
“We were originally in the Donovan Andree trophy division II, then we won the Donovan Andree under Laddie Outstchoorn and we were promoted to Sara trophy division I. Dan Piachaud was the first Sara captain and in that Sara side we had Abu Fuard, Lorenz Pereira, Kevin Perera, Vernon Davidson and five Peterite captains HIK Fernando, Travis Fernando, Darrel Wimalaratne, Tony Opatha and myself. It was unique to have five Peterite captains in the first Sara side. We also had Brian Obeysekera, Tony Amith and HN de Silva. There is no mention at all about the Sri Lankans who played in the first year of the Sara side which I believe was in 1971.”
Rodney played cricket for CCC only for a short period more time was spent playing rugby for CH.
Since moving to Melbourne, Rodney who is presently retired at 67 worked in a bank for about eight years, was in the public service for another eight years and later helped his son in his printing business.
He has two sons Ryan and Keith and daughter Shanika but none took to sport seriously, although his grandsons have shown the inclination to do so.
