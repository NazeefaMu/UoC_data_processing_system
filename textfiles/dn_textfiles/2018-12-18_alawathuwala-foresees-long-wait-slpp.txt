Alawathuwala foresees long wait for SLPP

Kurunegala District Parliamentarian J.C. Alawathuwala said the SLPP will have to wait for another couple of years to form a new government.
He was speaking at a media briefing at his residence in Millawa on Sunday morning.
He said in three-and-a-half years after coming into power, the UNP has been able to fullfil the pledges mentioned in the election manifesto. Under the leadership of Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe, the government has decided to give facilities to 2,000 entrepreneurs in Wayamba to develop their exports before 2020.
“Former President Mahinda Rajapaksa had not initiated any important development projects in the Kurunegala district during his tenure of nearly 10 years. Now they are attempting to resume violent activities.
Whatever they do, the SLPP cannot win the game. The bankrupt Pohottuwa will have to wait for another couple of years to form a new government,” he said.
The UNP is still very popular among the people and it could be seen from the tremendous public support it received, he said.
