Together in good times and bad

Life is diverse and it brings to one’s fold various relationships and at times these relationships colour your life in the most unexpected ways. It is believed that many of those who you would meet in your life are your fellow travellers in samsara. The traveller which may have one of the most significant impacts in your life will be your partner in life; the one who promises to stand by you until death do you part. But, as divorce rates soar and stories of husbands beating their wives daily sometimes as brutally as to kill them with an axe or where wives murder their husbands are plenty, we bring to you the story of a man who has sacrificed it all for his wife.
The passions of youth brought them together but marriage solidified their love for each and as they reach their twilight years, the couple has stood strong despite the tragic circumstances they now find themselves in. We met this couple; S. Selliah and Magi Nona by sheer coincidence, in the Mahameddewa division in the Nawattegama Divisional Secretariat. Their story was related to us by Selliah, he was the narrator of their story while Magi Nona remained silent.
Standing by her
The old couple, living in a thatched hut on Temple Road, Ralapanawa, Nawaththegama live a difficult life. Selliah and Magi Nona have been married for over 25 years and throughout that journey they have both sacrificed much for each other and Selliah especially has had to give up much. Magi Nona suffers from a debilitating illness which makes her unable to do many things on her own, but Selliah has stuck by her and has looked after her every need with love and kindness. Though Tamil by descent, he has over the years chosen to pay homage to Buddhism and the monks along with alms being regularly presented to them.
“It has been over 25 years since we got married. Though we live here now, I am from Kekirawa. My wife is from Hiripitiya. At the start, I made a living through the sale of sesame. I met my wife on one of my trips. Her mind has always been slightly unstable. When I went to her village to sell sesame, she followed me round and came with me. I felt sorry for her. Since that day we have been living together. Though I am Tamil and she is Sinhala; that did not matter to us much. With much difficulty, I tried various charms ‘Gurukam’ and cured my wife. We lived very happily together for a long time. I even sent her to temple every Poya day,” related 78- year- old Selliah.
I was born a Tamil but over time I learned to work alongside Sinhala people, said Selliah. When he first arrived in Nawaththegama, the area was a jungle. He had to clear the jungle to make a home for himself and his wife and at the time, he also abandoned selling sesame and took to chena cultivation.
Magi Nona’s failing health
“Five years ago my wife started to get sick once again. But, I could not leave her just because she was sick. Moreover, my wife and I love each other dearly and the idea of separation is unimaginable. One day, all of a sudden, she developed a back pain. Gradually that pain worsened, I visited every doctor I knew and used every medicine possible. It did not cure her. In the end, she became paralysed. I spent all the money I had on her treatment, I even sold the milking cows I had to find money to treat her. Even then she was not cured. Today I attend to all her needs, I am able to look after her with these two hands of mine,” he said.
It is Selliah who is not only the primary caregiver to Magi Nona but he also takes care of all the housework as well. He cooks for her, cleans her and must also find means to earn an income for them.
“I attend to all her work. I bathe and clean her and wash her clothes. I cook food so we can have it for two meals. Otherwise I just cook one meal a day for us. We have water problems in this area. Bowsers deliver water to us. We have to manage everything with that water. Earlier I had a good cultivation going and we used to make a living by growing vegetables. But now it is very hard for me to engage in such work. My knees have started to ache. Those who live around us and even some from far away give us some food rations to live by but that doesn’t happen every day. On average we might have two people coming to see us every month.
We also receive a ‘ping padiya’ of Rs. 2,000 per month. We make do with that. Even though I might not have food to eat, I somehow manage to get some rice for my wife. I provide some alms to the temple with the little means I have. I carry on with her work no matter how difficult. That is how we live,” explained Selliah.
Perhaps Magi Nona has done much good in her life to have a husband such as Selliah in her twilight years. Their fates entwined, they have lived their lives together in love and kindness; their lives have become an inspiration to all.
“I undergo much difficulties and suffering in my day to day life. If there is someone to help us out, we would wish great merit on them. We too will soon pass away and until then my only solace and happiness is to take care of my wife until the last. It would be great if someone can assist me in fulfilling that,” said Selliah as we prepared to leave.
He appealed for help with eyes filled with tears. Despite the little means they have, they have become accustomed to making the maximum use of whatever they have. Given the circumstances, Selliah has mastered this art. Having spent over 25 years of his life with Magi Nona, their journey has come to a standstill here. Happiness, sadness, a smile, a tear; they have all been cemented together into one, on his face.
