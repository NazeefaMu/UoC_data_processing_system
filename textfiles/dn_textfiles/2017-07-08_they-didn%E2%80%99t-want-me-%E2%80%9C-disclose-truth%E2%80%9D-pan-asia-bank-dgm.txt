They didn’t want me “ to disclose the truth” : Pan Asia Bank DGM

Treasury Bond issue :
In a shocking revelation at the Bond Commission hearing yesterday Richard Dias, the Deputy General Manager of Pan Asia Bank, said that Arjun Aloysius and former Chairman of Pan Asia Bank Nimal Perera had called him on multiple occasions to pressure him into “ not disclosing the truth” during evidence.
Giving evidence before the Commission for the second time yesterday, Dias said that Aloysius called him on June 29 following a news item on the electronic media. “He (Aloysius) pleaded me to meet with him. I showed him my dissatisfaction (about being a part of the issue) because I’m a professional and my career is at stake,” Dias said giving testimony led by Deputy Solicitor General Milinda Gunathillake.
Giving further evidence, Dias said that Aloysius insisted that the two of them met and accordingly on June 30, Dias went to the home of Aloysius.
“Aloysius asked me what I would like to drink and I asked for a glass of water.” Dias said the two spoke of the news item that was telecast.
“Aloysius told me that even if I was told to walk out (of the current job) that I will have a place in his (Aloysius’s company”.
Justice Jayawardena asked Dias as to why he went to meet Aloysius at his home. Dias said ‘following the media report, the PABC has raised some concern regarding the matter and that he ( Dias) was worried about the possibility of being fired.
“I wanted to know if the former Chairman Nimal Perera has discussed anything regarding my job with Mr. Aloysius. That is why I went to his place.”
“I also expressed my dissatisfaction regarding the whole matter. My career and my reputation are at stake. I am very worried as to what my family and relatives think of me as well.” Dias added.
Thereafter Dias said he received three telephone calls from Arjun Aloysius on June 3 and 4, 2017. According to the evidence lead, Dias has received calls at 9.12 pm on June 3 and at 6.31 am and 3.48 pm on June 4. Dias said he refrained from answering any of the calls.
Asked as to what Dias assumes regarding these communications and the attempted ones, he said, “They probably would have been trying to prevent me from revealing truth at the Commission” Asked as to what he refers to as ‘the truth’, Dias said it means ‘the revelations he is making regarding the intermediary role the PABC played under the directions of former Chairman Nimal Perera in consultation with PTL CEO Kasun Palisena and Arjun Aloysius.
“I then received a call from my former Chairman Nimal Perera on June 4, 2017 in the evening around 3.21 pm. I was leaving the Treasury bond Commission after giving statements to the police team. Since I received the call while I was traveling, I told him that I will call back. Then after reaching my office, I called my former Chairman,” Dias said.
Dias was then requested to describe the content of the conversation that transpired between himself and Nimal Perera.
“His initial call was a shock to me. He asked me whether I have been summoned by the Presidential Commission to testify. I told him ‘No’. I explained to him that I was only there to give a statement to the police. But Nimal Perera said that I will be summoned before the Commission to testify. I did not know about it by then.” Dias explained.
Justice Prasanna Jayawardena directed the Attorney General’s Office to look for legal provisions to take action against Aloysius and Perera for interfering with witnesses of the Commission. Senior Additional Solicitor General Dappula de Livera consented.
Dias further went on to say that Nimal Perera assured him a ‘place’ in his moneybroking company if he had to walk out of his current working place. Dias said it was only later he received a call requesting to come before the Commission to testify.
Commissioner Justice P.S.Jayawardena asked whether the witness knew Arjun Aloysius before. He said he had met him several times at former PABC Chairman Nimal Perera’s residence. Asked as to why he went to Nimal Perera’s house, Dias said he was requested to come to meet PTL CEO Kasun Palisena and Arjun Aloysius regarding secondary market transactions of February 27, 2015 bonds and the issued PTL faced in not being able to settle the Intra Day facility provided by the CBSL to Primary Dealers on March 2016.
According to evidence given by Dias, the PABC purchased the February 27,2015 Treasury bonds in the secondary bond market under the instructions of former PABC Chairman Nimal Perera.
The quantity and the prices were decided by the PTL, it was also said. In March 2016, when the PTL was short in liquidity to settle the Intraday Liquidity facility provided by the CBSL, the Former PABC Chairman Nimal Perera again instructed Dias to purchase assets from the PTL as a means of injecting money to the PTL to settle their issue.
“I thought it was a very risky thing to do from the part of my bank and my career. I was the one who should take the decision in doing as requested by former Chairman Nimal Perera. So I refused to do as instructed,” Dias said.
Dias said he once met Aloysisus when he was visiting Perera’s house regarding a matter mentioned above. “I met Aloysius in the lift. I cannot remember if PTL CEO was in the lift as well,” Dias said.
Commissioner Justice P.S.Jayawardena then questioned Dias regarding the ‘lift’ he was speaking about.
“You keep referring to a lift. Where were you meeting Nimal Perera?” Justice Jayawardena questioned.
“I met him at his residence,” Dias replied.
“Do you mean to say there is a lift in Nimal Perera’s house?” Justice Jayawardena asked. Dias confirmed so.
Senior Additional Solicitor General Dappula de Livera voicing his views following Justice Jayawardena’s remark that ‘isn’t it a normal house’ said ‘it should be a palace then’, to the much amusement of those who were present at the hearing.
Deputy Solicitor General Milinda Gunatilake produced contact details of Aloysius and Nimal Perera to the Commission.
He also produced deal tickets relating to transactions where PABC has acted as an intermediary between the PTL and the EPF at the February 27,2015 auction.
Justice Jayawardena reflecting on a document produced asked as to why an image of a ‘crown’ ‘similar to British Monarch’s’ appear above Nimal Perera’s contact details. “I am baffled as to why a ‘crown’ appears there.” Justice Jayawardena said. “It is the British Crown!” he pointed out.
Additional Solicitor General Yasantha Kodagoda rose to say ‘since his friend De Livera suggested Nimal Perera’s house seem to be a ‘palace’ a ‘crown’ is rather matching as well.
The telephone call recordings relevant to the 27 February 2015 auction that have taken place between the PABC, PTL and the EPF will be produced before the Commission next Monday (10).
PTL counsel Nihal Fernando PC requested the presence of PTL CEO Kasun Palisena to get instructions regarding the call recordings if necessary to which the Presidential Commission granted permission.
