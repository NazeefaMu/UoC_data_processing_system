UNP LEADERSHIP CRISIS
We want Sajith - Marikkar

Former Colombo District Parliamentarian S.M.Marikkar yesterday said that majority of UNP party members are of the view that UNP leader Ranil Wickremesinghe should step down paving the way for Sajith Premadasa to become the party leader.
“The Party should give an ear to the voice of party members, if it wants to win at future elections,”he said.
Speaking at a press conference held at Temple Trees yesterday, Marikkar added that former Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe led the party for more than 24 years and the people are now crying for a change in the leadership.
He said that the United National Party will form a broader alliance to vie for the upcoming election.
“We have two options. Either we have to go before court and solve this issue or contest the forthcoming election,” he said.
