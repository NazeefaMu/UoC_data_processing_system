Jak, Croton represent voters in provincial council

Jak and Croton leaves and grass came into focus when the Southern Provincial Council met at the Council hall yesterday chaired by Council Chairman Somawansa Kodagoda.
UPFA member Saliya Mendis attended the meeting wearing a garland of jak leaves.
Vice Chairman Sampath Athukorala making a special statement said the government instead of making preparations to meet a prospective drought, was advising people to feed on croton and jak leaves.
He made the speech displaying these leaves in his hands. UPFA member A.G.C. Jayasiri started distributing croton leaves among members subscribing to the joint opposition group.
UNP member Jayantha Jayaweera said it was the SLFP members who had made the suggestion.
UNP member Asoka Dhanawansa de Silva displaying a sheaf of grass said members who brought jak leaves to the house should be given grass to eat.
When the meeting ended in the midst of tension and cat calls, Jak and croton leaves and grass were littered all over the floor.
