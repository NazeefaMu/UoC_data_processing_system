Sampath Bank Pahe Shishyathwa  continues to empower students

Over 1,800 students and 1,600 parents took part in workshops of the Sampath Bank “Pahe Shishyathwa” seminar series held recently at Kirindiwela Central College, Kirindiwela and Malwattawala Central College, Wellawaya.
The Bank has been conducting these workshops for nine consecutive years to support underprivileged students around the country. It seeks to provide them with the requisite knowledge and skills to help them better prepare for the most challenging exams during their primary school years.
Sampath Bank will be conducting similar workshops in Polghawela, Galle,Homagama, Batticaloa and Ratnapuraduring the coming months.
Every year, about 350,000 students sit for the grade five scholarship exams across Sri Lanka with the hope of getting the opportunity to pursue their further studies at some of the country’s premier educational institutions. It is viewed as a ticket to a brighter future, especially for students from underprivileged, rural communities.
However, it is these students who often do not have the necessary support infrastructure to help them in preparing for this exam. Having realized the challenges they face, Sampath Bank embarked on this noble initiative in 2009 to take the best of training and resources closer to their hometowns.
The free workshops are open to all students sitting for the exam this year irrespective of whether they hold an account with Sampath Bank or not.
Participants can directly walk in on the day of the event without any prior registrations. “At Sampath Bank, we actively strive to add value to the communities that we are present in, with education being one of the key focus areas of these engagement initiatives. Given the importance of education in shaping a child’s future, we are delighted to conduct the Sampath Bank “Pahe Shishyathwa” seminar series for 9 consecutive years with the aim of supporting underprivileged students,”. said Lalith Weragoda, Head of Human Resources, Sampath Bank.
While touching on the core subject areas, the Sampath Bank “Pahe Shishyathwa” seminar series primarily focuses on grooming their minds to not give into examination and face such challenging situations with greater confidence.
