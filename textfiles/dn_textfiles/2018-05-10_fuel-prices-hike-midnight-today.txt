Fuel prices to hike from midnight today

 
The Finance Ministry said that the price of fuel will increase from midnight today.
Accordingly the price of 92 octane petrol was increased to Rs. 137 per liter, 95 Octane petrol was increased to Rs.148, Auto Diesel was increased to Rs. 109, Super Diesel was increased to Rs. 119 and Kerosene was increased to Rs. 101.
The prices were determined according to a pricing formula which the Central Bank urged the government to imply, citing that under pricing fuel adversely affects Sri Lanka’s balance of payments and puts pressure on the currency.
The price hike was felt in Sri Lanka as a result of the fuel price hike in the global market, which rose above US$70 on May 8, for the first time since 2014.
