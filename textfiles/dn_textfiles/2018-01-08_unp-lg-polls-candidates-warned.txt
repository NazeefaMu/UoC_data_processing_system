UNP LG polls candidates warned

The United National Party in its 71st Convention sounded a warning to all its candidates citing that law breakers and the corrupt will be severely dealt with.
“With position comes power and responsibility. As a member of the UNP and a contestant for the forthcoming polls, we urge you to use it wisely,” Minister Kabir Hashim told the convention gathering at Campbell Park yesterday.
Education Minister, Akila Viraj Kariyawasam reiterated the government’s commitment to further education in the country based on a new education sector plan. “We have spearheaded a new insurance scheme where every child is covered for life,” he said. “We’ve begun the process of digitalisation and will ensure that every student stays in school for 14 years.”
Sri Lanka’s first female mayoral candidate for Colombo, Rosy Senanayake commended the efforts of the UNP for calling for a greater participation of women at the upcoming LG polls.
The issue of garbage disposal and the dengue menace are two issues she highlighted as being of paramount importance. “I request you to join me in ensure we come together to make Colombo, a beautiful and clean city.”
Vadivel Suresh, a former minister and parliamentarian from Badulla praised the Premier for giving him the opportunity to speak at the event, adding that the gesture speaks to the heart of the Tamil speaking community.
“I would not have had the chance to speak to you today if weren’t for the Prime Minister,” he said in Tamil. “This gesture speaks volume on how the UNP does not divide by caste, creed or ethnicity.”
