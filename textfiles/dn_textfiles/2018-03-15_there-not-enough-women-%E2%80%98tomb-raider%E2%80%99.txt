There is not  enough women in  ‘Tomb Raider’

Alicia Vikander has admitted that ‘there is not enough women’ in her new ‘Tomb Raider’ movie.
The Oscar winner stars in the rebooted Lara Croft movie but she was asked about the lack of women in the film which is known for it’s incredibly strong and empowering lead character, and she revealed she was left wondering during filming where the women were.
“I got to work with Kristin Scott Thomas and she is an extraordinary actress, but me too, I agree,’ she told Alex Jones on The One Show who told Alicia that she was ‘slightly disappointed that you were this brilliant main lead and then everyone else, bar two minor roles, were men again,” she said. “I was on the island and I was thinking, “there are not enough women”. I was running around looking for them!’ she added.
Alicia previously claimed that the rebooted version of the 1990s game would pass the Bechdel test, revealing that the film ‘actually has relationships and stories’; the Bechdel test is an effective parameter in testing whether a film is sexist – and requires a movie to have two women that talk to each other about something other than a man in order to pass.
The new movie will follow Lara as a a 21-year-old bike messenger who leaves behind her old life to look for a fabled tomb off the coast of Japan in order to find her eccentric father, who vanished when she was a teenager. ‘Tomb Raider’ is out on March 15. Metro
