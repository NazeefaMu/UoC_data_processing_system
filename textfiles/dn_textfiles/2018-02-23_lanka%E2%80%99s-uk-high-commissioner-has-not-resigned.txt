Lanka’s UK High Commissioner has not resigned

Sri Lanka’s High Commissioner to the United Kingdom Mrs. Amari Wijewardene, has not resigned but will conclude her posting on March 31, 2018 on her own volition, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs said in a media release.
The release denied what it called “incorrect reports being circulated in the media” claiming that Mrs. Wijewardene had resigned with immediate effect.
Mrs. Wijewardene, a reputed businesswoman, has been serving as the country’s High Commissioner to the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Island since November 2016.
Prior to her appointment, she was the Chairperson and Managing Director of the Swadeshi
Group of Companies. She has over 35 years experience in various business sectors, including manufacturing, marketing, and exports.
