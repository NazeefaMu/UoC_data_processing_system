‘Baby Fed’matures into major contender

MELBOURNE, Thursday: Despite his ‘Baby Fed’ nickname and penchant for arcade games, Grigor Dimitrov could be finally maturing into a major contender as he guns for a spot in his first Grand Slam final.
The unassuming Bulgarian has spent years on the fringes of tennis’s top ranks, but Dimitrov will make a name for himself if he ends Rafael Nadal’s magical run in the Australian Open semi-finals on Friday.
His game has long been compared to Roger Federer’s but while he has a similar, one-handed backhand and effortless movement, he’s been lacking in one important aspect -- results.
But last year Dimitrov teamed with Daniel Vallverdu, Andy Murray and Tomas Berdych’s ex-coach, and a change has been apparent at the start of this season. The 25-year-old picked up his first title since 2014 at this month’s Brisbane International and he is unbeaten so far this year after putting together a 10-match winning streak, matching the best of his career. He beat three top-10 players -- Kei Nishikori, Milos Raonic and Dominic Thiem -- en route to his fifth career title, with Richard Gasquet and David Goffin, the 18th and 11th seeds, among his victims in Melbourne.
Now Nadal, 30, is warily eyeing the 15th seed who stands between him and a crack at a 15th major title, three seasons and several injuries after his last.
“He’s a player that has unbelievable talent, unbelievable potential. He started the season playing unbelievable,” Nadal said of Dimitrov.
“It’s going to be a very tough match for me. I hope for him, too. I’m going to try to play my best because I know he’s playing with high confidence.” AFP
