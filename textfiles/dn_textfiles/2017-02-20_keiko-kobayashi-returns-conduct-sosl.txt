Keiko Kobayashi returns to conduct the Sosl

Dynamic and inspiring Japanese conductor Keiko Kobayashi returns to Sri Lanka to conduct the Symphony Orchestra of Sri Lanka's "Virtuosi in Concert" on March 15, 2017. Staged at the Ladies' College Hall at 7.30pm, this concert will also feature three other internationally renowned musicians, Shani Diluka (Piano), Gabriel Le Magadure (Violin) and Valentin Erben (Cello) performing Beethoven's Triple Concerto.
ARTE extols Shani's skills as "Shani Diluka, her brilliant personality, and her capability of squeezing out the music to its last essence, is rare and beautiful". Born to Sri Lankan parents, Shani lives in Monaco. This will be her first performance with the Symphony Orchestra of Sri Lanka.
Ebène Quartet violinist Gabriel Le Magadure is widely recognized by international critics as an outstanding musician full of sensitivity, with a warm, deep sound and an exceptional capacity to listen.
Valentin Erben, an Austrian Cellist, was a former member of the prestigious Lucern Festival Orchestra conducted by Claudio Abbado. He was also the co-founder of the international string quartet, Alban Berg Quartet, which performed for almost 40 years.
