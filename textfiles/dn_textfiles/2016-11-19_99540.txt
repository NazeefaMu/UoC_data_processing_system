Father of Haseeb Hameed quit job to coach baby boycott

Haseeb Hameed's father Ismail hails from Umraj, a village in the state of Gujarat, six hours’ drive from Rajkot, scene of his England debut last week. His mother Najma is also Gujarati.
Haseeb Hameed is only the second teenager to make his debut for England since 1949. Hameed's father Ismail (left) and his brothers Safwaan and Nuaman were in attendance in Rajkot as the youngster made his debut
Ismail Hameed emigrated and settled in Bolton in 1969, working in the Lancashire town's cotton factories before becoming a driving instructor so he could devote more time to coaching Haseeb after school.
Ismail's love of cricket, and particularly Geoffrey Boycott's discipline towards batting, led him to coach his older sons Safwaan and Nuaman - now in their 30s - when they were younger.
An opening batsman himself in the Bolton Association League, he was known as ‘Geoffrey’ for the way he played.
Although it was only a pastoral passion, coaching his sons in cricket became his ‘other’ job.
He sent his eldest sons to play for Tonge Cricket Club in Bolton and attempted to provide them with a similar path towards professional cricket.
Neither made it past club level, although a series of injuries held back Safwaan, who has followed his father's lead by coaching in the area.. Haseeb would hijack their family coaching sessions at Rawsthorne Park, with his tiny Gray-Nicolls bat tucked under his arm.
According to Haseeb, his father ‘sacrificed his life’ to help the brothers succeed in theirs. Last season he was still giving Haseeb throw-downs in the nets at Old Trafford.
The family make regular trips back to Gujarat and were on hand to witness his 82 against India. Sisters Ateqah and Subhana complete the five siblings.
They were all due to be in India anyway for Nuaman's wedding to Nadiya, which Haseeb missed to remain with England. - Daily Mail
