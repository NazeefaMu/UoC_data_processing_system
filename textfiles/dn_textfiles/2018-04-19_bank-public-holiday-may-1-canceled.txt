Bank, public holiday on May 1 canceled

 
The bank and public holiday which fall on May 1 to commemorate the international working class solidarity is canceled and instead moved to May 7.
The decision to move May Day celebrations to May 7 was made by the government on request of the Mahanayake Theros, to avoid the celebration coinciding with the Vesak full moon Poya day.
