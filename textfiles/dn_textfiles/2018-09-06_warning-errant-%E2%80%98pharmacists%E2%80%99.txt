Warning for errant ‘pharmacists’

Registration as a pharmacy is mandatory for any concern dispensing pharmaceuticals.
Health Minister Rajitha Senaratne told the Daily News that there were complaints from pharmacy owners that some medical practitioners keep a stock of medicines with them. In response, raids would be conducted to detect those maintaining stocks of pharmaceuticals without registration.
He said that there has been a dearth of pharmacists and a training scheme for staff attached to private pharmacies and medical units is being implemented.
