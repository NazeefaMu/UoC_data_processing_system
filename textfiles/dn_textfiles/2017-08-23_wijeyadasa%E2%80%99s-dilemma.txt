Wijeyadasa’s dilemma

At the time of writing these lines the fate of Justice and Buddhasasana Minister Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe is yet unknown. It is reported that Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe had requested the President to remove the embattled minister after the latter had failed to respond to a three member committee appointed by the party over his expressing contrary views to that held by the UNP led government on the Hambantota Port leasing and thus breaching collective Cabinet responsibility. The PM’s decision followed a stormy UNP parliamentary group meeting at Temple Trees on Monday evening where member after member had voiced their indignation, calling for the ouster of Rajapakshe. What the President will decide on the issue will be known soon. Rajapakshe had already stated that it is only the President who has the authority to remove him while denying any wrong doing, claiming that he had been quoted out of context in the media on the Hambantota affair.
However, it is clear that more than the Hambantota matter, it is Rajapkshe’s failure in getting corruption cases against members of the former regime fast tracked that has caused the UNP membership to take issue with him and led to the current ruckus. We say this because there have been other ministers, notably Minister Susil Premajayantha who had not only spoken against the Hambantota deal but also against other so-called sale of national assets but has continued to go unscathed. Even Minister Arjuna Ranatunga had murmurings to make against Hambantota, with the result that he had the Ports Ministry taken away from him and entrusted with Petroleum Resources. It appears that it is only UNP ministers in the Unity Government who are being penalized for their alleged infractions, with Ravi Karunanayake leading the way, while ministers of the SLFP are getting away with anything they say and do.
Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe, it must be said, did not merely breach collective Cabinet responsibility but went further afield and was making statements contradicting government policy and clearly throwing a spanner in the works in the government’s efforts to bring the big time crooks to justice which was the main plank of the election platform of the Yahapalanaya government. The contrary views he often expressed to that made by other government ministers for establishing a more potent legal mechanism to rope in the corrupt, no doubt, sowed the seeds of suspicion among the UNP membership as to the direction their Justice Minister was traversing. Eyebrows were raised when Rajapakshe once declared in parliament that he would never allow Gotabhaya Rajapaksa to be thrown behind bars and had a slanging match with Field Marshal Sarath Fonseka over his (Rajapakshe’s) soft pedaling of the Avant Garde matter. Fonseka later exposed Rajapakshe’s personal links with the Avant Garde boss, with photographic evidence.
Rajapakshe was also looked at askance by the UNP membership over his hardline nationalist stance and the not so subtle views expressed with regard to the so-called privileged position enjoyed by the minority communities and religions in this country at the expense of the Buddhists.
It was as if Rajapakshe was working in league with the strident nationalist elements in the Joint Opposition such as Wimal Weerawansa and Udaya Gammanpila. Needless to say, all members of the JO in parliament were set to oppose the No Confidence motion that was mooted against Rajapakshe, with Mahinda Rajapaksa saying he could not vote against apey gamey miniha. Rajapakshe, in the view of the UNPers, was gravitating towards the Joint Opposition, and, what is more, was making no bones about it, given the sentiments already expressed vis-a-vis Gota.
The way members of Sangha community rallied to express their solidarity with Rajapakshe also created the impression that the Justice and Buddhasasana Minister had embarked on a mission of his own, the contours of which will be known in the coming days. True, as Buddhasasana Minister he has to protect the interests of the Sangha and voice his concerns when the members of the Sangha are belittled in any manner. It is also well within his remit to speak out against alleged destruction and vandalism of Buddhist monuments and artifacts, said to be occurring in the North and East.
However, his dalliance with such personages as the Ven Galagodatte Gnanasara, after the latter’s antics were in full public display, especially in court houses, gave the inescapable feeling to many UNPers that Rajapakshe was out of synch with the policies and precepts of Greens and was working to a different political agenda altogether.
Be that as it may, if Rajapakshe desires to embark on a different political journey the UNP cannot stop him. It appears that he has already burnt his bridge with the Greens. Things are certainly not going to be the same, even in the event of a patch up. The Justice Minister has already shown his hand in ample measure, for the UNP leadership to now entertain any misgivings. Rajapakshe has obviously taken an irrevocable step, as far as his position in the UNP is concerned.
