Elephants drive farmers to distress

Three thousand farmer families have been left high and dry as a result of destruction caused to their cultivations by wild elephants. Farmers close to the Madunagala sanctuary and adjoining villages are the worst affected.
Residents said although an electric fence has been set up across 16 kilometres around the Madunagala sanctuary, elephants break the electric fence and enter villages.
