Auction of Malwana land allegedly owned by Basil suspended

Pugoda Magistrate and Additional District Judge Nilupuli Lankapura yesterday suspended the auction of the 16-acre Malwana land and house said to be owned by former Development Minister Basil Rajapaksa and Thirukumar Nadesan.
The magistrate made this order after the court was informed that the Cabinet of Ministers has decided to use the land for the welfare of the people. The FCID informed the court the decision of the Attorney General to use the land bordering the Kelani river for the welfare of the people.
Considering the submissions by the FCID, the magistrate reserved the judgement for March 23.
The minimum bid was set at Rs.208 million on the Valuation Department assessment. A case was filed by the FCID under the Money Laundering Act following a complaint that former Minister Basil Rajapaksa had bought the 16-acre land at Mapitigama for Rs. 64 million and built a luxury house on it at a cost of Rs. 125 million.
It was alleged the land and the house belonged to Rajapaksa, and that it was bought using public funds.
However, lawyers for the former Economic Development Minister told Court that the land did not belong to their client.
