Report to duty immediately, PMG  urges postal employees

Postmaster General (PMG) Rohana Abeyratne had urged all postal employees to report to duty immediately.
While issuing a communique, he said that all provincial and deputy post officers, including postal superintendents, had been advised to provide transport and other necessary facilities to their employees.
Abeyratna added that there were complaints and reports on obstructions posed on postal workers by postal unions. However, the unions had stated that discussions held with the Salaries and Remuneration Commission had concluded without a proper solution.
United Postal Trade Union Front Convener Chinthaka Bandara said steps would be taken to augment trade union actions from yesterday.
