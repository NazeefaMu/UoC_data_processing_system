Sri Lankadhara society celebrates 96th anniversary

The Sri Lankadhara Society, one of the oldest charity organisations in Sri Lanka marks its 96th anniversary today.
This society, with the objective of caring and providing shelter for underprivileged girls and women, was found in 1922 by the philanthropists, Dr. W. A. de Silva, a former Minister in the State Council and his wife Catherine de Silva at a time when there were no such facilities available outside the Church-run charities. They established the Society in a custom built British style building on the then High Street, Wellawatta.
Since then, the society has expanded its activities to provide shelter and care for elderly women, abandoned girls and female infants.
It also conducts a pre-school and a day-care centre for children and another day-care centre for senior citizens from the neighbourhood.
The society, over the years has been managed by Governing Boards of voluntary women commencing from the first benefactor, Catherine de Silva as its founder President.
Personalities such as the late Senator Cissy Cooray, the late N. S. E. Perera, and more recently, Kanthi Amerasinghe had held the presidency of the Society.
The current President, Pushpa Ailapperuma held the position for the last three years and she is a retired public servant.
Nelun Dias, the current Vice-President, expects to take over the reins from next year.
Contact Ailapperuma (President) on 072 751 6670 or email her at [email protected] for details.
