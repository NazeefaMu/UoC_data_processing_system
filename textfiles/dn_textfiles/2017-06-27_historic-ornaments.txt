Historic ornaments

‘Ati-kukula’ s (Partridge) favourite dish is snail.
Tree-snails creep duwn from their hiding place at night when partridges are sleeping on trees. Snails sleep during daytime clinging to tree trunks or undercovers of leaves. They are also called ‘Veda Golu bellas’ as their thick juice is a very effective burn-healer. The history tells that the ‘Balangoda-manawaya’ used to eat snails and worn their shells as ornaments.
