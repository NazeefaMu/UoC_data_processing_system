Abans unveils latest  Apple Macbook Pro

Abans Plc a leading brand for consumer electronics, has recently unveiled the newest generation of the Apple MacBook Pro series for the first time ever in Sri Lanka.
Featuring an integrated Touch Bar, Apple’s latest innovation, the groundbreaking MacBook Pro aims to redefine, revolutionize, and enhance the computer user experience, while catering to the diverse variety of needs conveyed by consumers.
The new MacBook Pro boasts a much thinner and lighter design, while being equipped with a unique fingerprint scanner. It also continues Apple’s rollout of the USB-C, which was introduced with the MacBook last year.
The Touch Bar and Touch ID features provide you with a progressive new way of using your MacBook Pro. Replacing the function keys that have long occupied the top of your keyboard, the dynamic Touch Bar gives you instant access to the tools you require for the relevant task on hand.
You can achieve several tasks through the Touch Bar including, expanding, contracting, and customizing system controls; answering iPhone or FaceTime calls from the touch bar without moving the cursor; selecting a palette and tapping to choose a colour for text or objects; using text suggestions and emoji for the Message and Mail apps; and function key capabilities.
The right end of the strip also contains Apple’s Touch ID fingerprint scanner integrated into the power button, which is similar to the one fitted onto the iPhone and iPad, and can be used to unlock the laptop and confirm payments.
Commenting on the unique Touch Bar, Phil Schiller, the Senior Vice President of Worldwide Marketing for Apple said, “It’s a retina display, multi touch, responding to gestures and taps. We call it Touch Bar. First it replaces the standard system functions, but it goes way beyond that. It adapts to whatever software you’re using.”
Craig Federighi, Senior Vice President of Software Engineering for Apple, showed that the Touch Bar could be used for navigation in browsers, photo manipulation, and text suggestions when typing. It can also suggest and insert emojis without leaving the keyboard.
With the MacBook Pro’s incorporation of a solid-state drive, you can access up to 100% faster flash storage, which allows you to boot up faster, launch multiple apps, or even quickly import huge files.
The MacBook Pro offers you up to 10 hours of battery life, letting you conduct your work on the notebook all day without interruption.
Visit your nearest Abans Apple iStore to attain the unique MacBook Pro with the Touch Bar at the following locations, Kollupitiya, Rajagiriya, Colombo Racecourse, Arcade Independence Square, Maharagama, KZone Ja-Ela, Katunayake, Kandy City Centre, Ratmalana, and Galle.
