Australia co-sponsors SL resolution

Australia has co-sponsored a reconciliation resolution to the United Nations with the Sri Lankan government.
The resolution, which aims to foster reconciliation and improve human rights and accountability of the nation, was tabled in the United Nations Human Rights council on Thursday.
Australian Foreign Minister Julie Bishop in a statement yesterday stated the resolution, if effectively implemented, would provide Sri Lanka a platform to heal the wounds of war crimes committed during the nation's conflict.
