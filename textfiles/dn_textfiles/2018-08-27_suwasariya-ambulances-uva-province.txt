Suwasariya ambulances for Uva Province

The 1990 Suwasariya ambulance service launched with an Indian grant of US$ 22 million, will be extended to the whole country. This will be done through an Act of Parliament, after which necessary funds would be allocated in the annual budget for its upkeep, State National Policy and Economic Affairs Minister Dr. Harsha de Silva said.
He was addressing a meeting at the Hali Ela Foreign Employment Service Centre of the Sri Lanka Bureau of Foreign Employment, to mark the extension of the Suwasariya ambulance service to the Uva Province, on August 24.
Under this service, 26 ambulances have been allocated to the Uva Province where they would be stationed at selected police stations in the province. The ambulances were officially handed over to the OICs of Police stations and the ambulance staff, at this ceremony.
State Minister Dr. de Silva said 143 ambulances equipped with the most modern medical equipment and manned by trained staff have been deployed for the Suwasariya ambulance service so far.
A total of 91,547 patients have been serviced by the ambulance service up to August 20.
The government hopes to increase the ambulance fleet to 300 in order to serve all parts of the country. The main objective was to enable the entire population of 21 million to summon an ambulance within minutes in an emergency, so that lives could be saved, he said.
Digital Infrastructure and Foreign Employment Minister Harin Fernando, organised the function. Parliamentarian Vadival Suresh, Provincial Minister Upali Samaraweera, the Badulla GA and DIG (Uva) Jagath Palihakkara were also present on the occasion.
