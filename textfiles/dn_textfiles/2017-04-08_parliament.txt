Parliament

Condolence message:
Late PM, an exemplary politician who looked down on fraud and corruption:President
Late Ratnasiri Wickramanayake was an exemplary politician who strongly objected to corruption and fraud, said President Maithripala Sirisena in Parliament yesterday.
He made this observation yesterday, joining the Condolence Motion on the demise of late Prime Minister Ratnasiri Wickramanayake, when it was taken for the second day.
He also said that late Wickramanayake was a leftist politician unlike politicians of the new trend who attempt to amass wealth from their initial stage. "Wickramanayake's family had tuskers, elephants, massive lands and shopping malls," President Sirisena said. "But they lost most of their wealth due to politics."
The President also said late Wickramanayake was the Secretary General of the the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) during the period when the late J R Jayewardene led the United National Party. "It was a difficult period for leftist politicians and the SLFP during that period when it was divided into three factions," the President said. "Even the children of the founder of SLFP late S W R D Bandaranaike formulated different parties."
The President also appreciated the late Wickramanayake for his ability to take quick decisions and his eloquence in speech.
Joint Opposition Member Vidura Wickramanayake said that his late father (Ratnasiri Wickramanayake) always believed that the country should be benefited by the acts of politicians rather than himself.
He also said that he was a Sinhalese and a great Buddhist. "But he never was a racist,' Vidura Wickramanayake said. "He stood against terrorism both in the North and South alike. There was much for upcoming politicians to study from him."
The Speaker also joined the condolence motion and ordered that a copy of the motion be sent to the family members of the late Ratnasiri Wickramanayake.

On this occasion, Leader of the House and Highways and Higher Education Minister Lakshman Kiriella questioned if the complain befall on the good governance government to which Handunnetti replied he had clearly stated the time period.
