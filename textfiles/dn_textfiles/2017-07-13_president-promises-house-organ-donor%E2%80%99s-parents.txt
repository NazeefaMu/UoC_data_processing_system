President promises house for organ donor’s parents

First heart transplant in Sri Lanka:
President Maithripala Sirisena promised a new house to the parents who donated the heart of their brain-dead 22-year-old son, Pradeep Kumara Sampath, to facilitate the historic heart transplant surgery at the Kandy General hospital, recently.
Pradeep Kumara Sampath was the only boy in the family with two other siblings, an elder sister and a younger sister.
Kandy General Hospital Director Dr. Saman Ratnayake said the President made this assurance of providing a new house when he informed the President about the economic plight of the parents.
Sampath's father I.G. Nandasena said when their son died they only thought of a possibility to donate his organs to give life to others as an act of charity in his name rather than seeking any financial or other gain.
He told Dr. Ratnayake that they lived in a tiny house without proper accommodation and they would be grateful if the state can provide them with a new house to live in.
When the doctor informed the President about this, the President promised to fulfill his request.
