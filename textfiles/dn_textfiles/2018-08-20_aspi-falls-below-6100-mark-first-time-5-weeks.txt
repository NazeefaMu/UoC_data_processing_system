Point of view
Sri Lankan equities extended its losing streak since mid-July, with the benchmark index dropping 90 points or 1.5% W-o-W to end notably below the psychological 6100-mark (6051.1).
This week’s drop below the 6100-mark is the first time since early July that the Index has ranged at this levels and was largely prompted by bargain hunting on Sri Lanka’s key blue-chip JKH which dropped 4.8% this week relative to last week.
The Index remained below this level for 3-consecutive days to trade between a narrow 35 point range.
Whether or not 6100 remains the Index’s support level or whether 6000 will be the new support level for the Index will be tested next week since in the previous 2 instances this year when the Index fell below the 6100 mark it rebounded within a short span of 2-3 days.
This week’s 90-point loss dragged the YTD loss on the ASPI to 5.6% from 4.2% last week, and while the Index lost 4.4% in Q2’18, so far in Q3’18 it has already wiped off 2.3% of its value.
Activity levels in the market meanwhile remained mostly dull during the week and weekly turnover decreased 48.1% W-o-W to Rs.2.2Bn cf. Rs.4.3Bn.
Average daily turnover over the week consequently declined to Rs.0.44Bn from Rs.0.86 last week as local institutional and HNI investor involvement in the market remained dull and crossings for the week reduced to Rs.0.9Bn (cf. 2.3Bn last week) with JKH accounting for the bulk (45%) of the week’s total crossings.
Foreign investors meanwhile continued to sell-off Sri Lankan equities and net foreign outflows this week totaled to Rs.0.7Bn (cf.0.2Bn outflow last week) widening the YTD net foreign outflow from the Colombo Bourse to Rs.3.5Bn.
Markets in the week ahead are likely to look for direction from the conclusion of the June-quarter earnings season.
Moody’s maintains credit rating at B1 (Negative)
Credit ratings agency Moody’s maintained Sri Lanka’s sovereign credit rating a B1 (Negative) adding that the country’s credit profile reflects the balance between progress in implementing reforms (fiscal consolidation and a build-up of FX), moderate per capita income levels and stronger institutions (than most similarly rated peers) against its vulnerability to tightening financial conditions.
The agency added that Sri Lanka’s credit challenges include high government debt levels, very low debt affordability and a fragile external payments position.
Moody’s added that the negative outlook on the sovereign’s credit profile signals that a rating upgrade is unlikely and is reflective of the Agency’s view that Sri Lanka’s credit profile is dominated by the government’s and country’s elevated exposure to refinancing risk, particularly in the context of significantly tighter external refinancing conditions during the next five years.
Moody’s added that it would consider raising the outlook to back to stable if these external and domestic refinancing risks were to ease, adding that faster and more sustained non-debt-creating FX flows (eg: FDI) along with clear evidence of the effectiveness of the country’s liability management strategies and a marked improvement in fiscal strength could prompt a return to a stable outlook.
However, the Agency may consider downgrading Sri Lanka’s sovereign rating if i) external and domestic refinancing capacity don’t improve, ii) there is a notable weakening in reserve adequacy (from the current low levels), or iii) there is a halt/reversal in the current fiscal consolidation process which raises the possibility of higher government debt and prevents a decline in gross borrowing requirements.
