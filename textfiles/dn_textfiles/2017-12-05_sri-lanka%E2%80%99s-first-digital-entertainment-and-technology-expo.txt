Sri Lanka’s first Digital Entertainment and Technology Expo

Play Expo Sri Lanka is the first Digital Entertainment & Technology expo in Sri Lanka, being held on December 8 to 10 at the SLECC. The exhibition is organised by Gamer.LK, the leader in eSports and Digital Entertainment experiences, and powered by Dialog Gaming. Play Expo is being organised with the goal of showcasing the latest technology and experiences available for digital entertainment enthusiasts. The expo caters to anyone interested in audio, video, music, movies, gaming and their related technologies. Technology and entertainment brands from around the world will be showcasing their products in experience zones for attendees to come and get hands-on time with the products they love.
Play Expo is poised to be unlike any other technology event held in the country to-date. With activities, competitions, panels and interactive engagements happening throughout the three-day event, Play Expo will also play host to Sri Lanka’s largest eSports and Video Game Championship – the Sri Lanka Cyber Games which returns for its 10th edition, alongside the Colombo Comic Expo which will feature Sri Lanka’s largest Cosplay competition and artist showcase. This brings a unique blend of technology, competition, and content creation/consumption to Play Expo which ensures an action packed 3 days for everyone attending.
“As Digital Entertainment enthusiasts, we identified a significant void in Sri Lanka’s exposure to the latest digital entertainment technology. While events like E3 and CES are held to large audiences in the United States, the South Asian region lacks initiatives that promote digital entertainment. We at Gamer.LK are taking the initiative to position Sri Lanka as a digital entertainment hub for South Asia, with the first step being Play Expo Sri Lanka. We’re happy to have Dialog Gaming partnered with us on this journey, as they have been a driving force in enabling digital entertainment service providers and products in Sri Lanka” said Raveen Wijayatilake of In Game Entertainment.
Leading multinational companies have come forward to support Play Expo Sri Lanka.
Dialog Gaming who brings fast, low latency connections to users in Sri Lanka has stepped in to power Play Expo. Dialog will also showcase their entire lineup of digital entertainment products and services available at the Dialog experience zones at Play Expo
