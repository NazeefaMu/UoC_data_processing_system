Sports Minister lays down strict conditions to resume schools rugby

Sports Minister Faiszer Musthapha laid down strict conditions for school rugby to resume from Monday May 28 after a meeting with Senior DIG Colombo Lalith Pathinayake and other officials connected with rugby yesterday.
A media release from the Ministry of Sports states the Minister’s attention was drawn to the violent incidents which occurred last week in the Singer Schools rugby tournament.
The Minister inquired from the Senior DIG Colombo Lalith Pathinayake what course of action could be taken after scrutinizing the video clips. The DIG informed that action could be taken after a complaint is made.
The Minister immediately directed the Schools Rugby Association to make a complaint with the police. He also directed that all video clips be handed over to the police. The Minister also requested that the culprits responsible should be arrested after studying the video clips and also the police should refuse bail.
Minister Mustapha further said that the culprits responsible for the violent incidents which occurred during the tournament that brought disrepute and caused damage to property should not be brought before a reconciliation board and treated leniently.
He pointed out that this would only lead to more violent incidents in the future and said that future incidents could be prevented if appropriate punishment is given and discipline maintained in future tournaments.
The Minister pointed out that the incidents that occurred during school tournaments was a direct result of liquor. In future the principal of the school, old boys, teachers and organizers should ensure that liquor is not brought into the grounds and consumed when rugby matches are underway.
In future the cardboard heroes who acted in this disgraceful manner will not be permitted to watch matches.
At the meeting the requirement for more tournament referees was also identified and the Minister also agreed to provide funds for the technical facilities.
The following conditions were laid down and adhered to:
lAll those responsible for the violent incidents which occurred to be brought to task and appropriate punishment meted out;
lSale of liquor in and around grounds hosting rugby tournaments to be banned and no one consuming liquor will be permitted entry to the grounds;
lAll persons who had resorted to violence will not be permitted to enter a ground where a match is being played;
lAll future tournaments will be held under strict discipline with the assistance of retired Deputy Inspector General of Police Hafeel Maso in co-ordination with all stakeholders.
