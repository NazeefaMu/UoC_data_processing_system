‘Values eroded in Wickremesinghe era’

The behaviour of certain politicians in the country has proved that men who are not nurtured by art and literature can commit any grave crime, said former Parliamentary Secretary to Prime Minister and former President Mahinda Rajapaksa, Kumarasiri Hettige.
Hettige who said the entire social order is in a state of unrest today, added that a society of compassionate men and women should he nurtured to overcome this situation.
He was addressing the gathering at the Gee Rasa Dehena musical event at Laksara Grand Resort, Morawaka, on October 23.
Hettige said the former Wickremesinghe government was an era where social, cultural, political, and other values had declined.
When there are unpleasant happenings in the higher echelons of government, such things filtered down to the people at large.
This is a time when the country is headed by people who loved their motherland and the people at large. Music and literature can render a great service to the nation, he said.
