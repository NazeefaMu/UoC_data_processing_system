GW Hotels to invest over  Rs 2.5 bn in Unavatuna

The newly formed GW Hotels Group, in Unavatuna, Galle, will invest over Rs. 2.5 billion for four leisure sector projects in the area.
Chairman Gamini Wickramarachchi said that their first venture was Rock Fort Hotel & Spa, a luxury hotel on the Unawatuna Beach. This hotel which opened two years ago has 20 luxury rooms including four suites, a spa, restaurant, bar, pool and two banquet halls and a rooftop restaurant.
He said that the hotel is maintaining high occupancy and they cannot cope up with the demand during the season. “Our main market is France, the UK and Germany and we are also witnessing increase bookings from China and Russia. This is why we decided to venture in a second hotel, Rock Fort Pearl, right opposite our hotel. Here we offer additional 10 rooms mainly targetting both local and foreign budget travelers. In a bid to increase more facilities, we will soon introduce a swimming pool to this hotel and more facilities.”
He said that they invested nearly Rs. 1 billion for these two hotels.
Having started business as a leading metal crusher and provider of earth movers in 1983, he diversified to the leisure sector mainly due to his passion for tourism and also to provide employment for youth.
“Today, we have provided over 100 employment opportunities and will offer further 125 placements from our next two projects.”
He said they have now acquired another demolished beach hotel in Thalpe to build a more luxurious hotel targetting the high-end client. “We will completely demolish this hotel and build 35 chalets with individual jacuzzis in some rooms at this property.”
He said that they will start construction of the new hotel in mid August and the hotel is to be completed in two years.

Group General Manager Deepthi Hettiarachchi said that with the opening of the highway, the hotels host many corporate events, mainly from Colombo and Matara and Galle, as well as weddings. “Due to high quality of service and our food and beverage menus, we are getting increasing bookings from the MICE sector.”
Hence, the GW Hotels Group is looking at building one of the biggest banquets halls in the area which could accommodate 1,000 guests. “We will also have 30 rooms and a swimming pool to offer a comprehensive package for guests using our MICE facilities.”
The Group, taking another step forward, also launched its website to increase web bookings which is the future mode of bookings. He also said that they are currently offering over 30% discounts for special card promotions for Sri Lankan guests. (SS)
