The National Child Protection Authority has forwarded the report to the Attorney General on the investigation carried out in connection with the alleged abuse of 250 schoolchildren during a wedding, the NCPA media spokesman said.
According to the spokesman, the NCPA had requested the AG’s advice on the possibility of filing a case against culprits under Section 308 of the Penal Code (Amendment) Act Number 22 of 1995.
The NCPA will take further action on the incident after obtaining the AG’s advice on future procedures. The NCPA received a complaint regarding the alleged abuse of 250 schoolchildren during a recent wedding that took place in Kandy, he said.
A total of 250 schoolchildren in Gannoruwa, Kandy were engaged in holding the train of a bride`s Osariya for a long time under the hot sun on the road during a wedding ceremony.
