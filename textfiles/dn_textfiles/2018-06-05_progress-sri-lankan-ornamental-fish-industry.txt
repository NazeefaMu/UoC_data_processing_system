Progress of Sri Lankan ornamental fish industry

Sri Lanka being an Island near the equator being a tropicalized country, which is evergreen for all 12 months surrounded by the Indian Ocean and ribbons of rivers flowing down to the sea like an unfolded fan from the middle up country top mountains, by nature we are blessed with water species, specially fish varieties, topping the attention of other continents towards ornamental fish of highest standards of quality.

The ornamental fish industry in Sri Lanka in early 1930s being not aware of the treasure the country possessed had imported ornamental fish as pet lovers and relief for mental stress and illnesses of patients.
Later in 1950s Sri Lankan exporters finding the value of the nature gifted item – the ornamental fish – ventured into the export market, the colourful aquarium fish with striking species of guppies, swordtails, Platys, barbs, tetras, angels, gouramies and catfish. Out of these freshwater species exported from Sri Lanka, about 60 – 70% consists of famous fancy guppies, highly recognized in international markets due to the strength and diversity of the particular fish species when compared to other exporting nations.
 
There are about 250 species of marine fish and more than hundred species of marine invertebrates to choose from. However, the restrictions being placed on the export and sale of wild caught species with the increasing concern of conservation Supplies mainly come from Natural environments eg. wild caught marine fish and invertebrates and from captive breeding. The major diving sites to catch ornamental fish in Sri Lanka are Kalpitiya, Ambalangoda, Hikkaduwa, Bentota, Weligama, Tangalle and Trincomalee.
A conducive climate and the availability of coral reefs, sand bars, lagoons around the country as well as inland water bodies such as streams, rivers and reservoirs provide the ideal ground for breeding of marine, brackish water and freshwater species in Sri Lanka. This is the very reason why Sri Lankan ornamental fish are in high demand and are exported all over the world. Marine fish and invertebrates are collected by experienced scuba divers without the use of any chemicals and carefully quarantined to guarantee the best quality when they reach the customer.
A Majority of ornamental fish production targets the export market, however, those not up to international quality standards are sold at the local market. There are around 45 established exporters in this sector.
Key markets supplied to are the USA, Japan, UK, Germany, France, Middle East, Korea, South Africa etc.
The Scuba divers adheres to Government’s rules, exporters to proper quarantine practices, The Wild Life Act is implemented, and training programs are conducted for breeders and fish farmers. Researches and development are in process for new varieties by National Aquatic Resource and Research Agency and National Aquaculture Development Authority. The Sri Lanka Export Development Board is currently developing quarantine facilities for exporters to ensure minimal health issues in ornamental fish exports.
The relevant Government Authorities penetrate that for the Dollars to fall into Sri Lanka by this industry that the newly constructed road system and highways, the airport in Hambantota and Island-wide information and training centres are well provided. Also, sees to the Health Certificate from the Dept. of Animal Quarantine), Certificate of Origin (Dept.of Commerce), GSP Form A for Marine Fish or Plants (Dept of Commerce), Permit for Restricted Species (Dept. of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources and Water Quality Certificate from NARA/ITI are obtained before sailing beyond the horizon.
Sri Lanka won 30 awards for the best and new varieties of various species at the “Aquarama 2013) International Ornamental Fish Competition held in Singapore indicating the professionalism in fish breeding.
