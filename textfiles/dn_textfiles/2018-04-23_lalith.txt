Lalith

Twenty five years ago, this day, Sri Lanka lost one of her illustrious sons to an assassin’s bullet, who, had he lived, would certainly have gone on to change the course of the country's political history and carve a niche for himself among the great leaders in post independence Sri Lanka.
Lalith Athulathmudali was no ordinary politician but one who was cast in the mould of an SWRD Bandaranaike. He was on the same intellectual plane as SWRD, both being Oxford alumni, and spoke with authority on many topics. To him politics was only a vehicle by which he strove to achieve his vision for the larger good of the country. It is indeed the country's misfortune that it had to lose a statesman of the calibre of Lalith Athulathmudali in the prime of his life before the full effect of his multifaceted talents and services could be realized and his vision for a prosperous Sri Lanka fulfilled.
Lalith was one of the brightest young stars in the J.R. Jayewardene government of 1977. While Gamini Dissanayake entered parliament in 1970 Lilith was thrust into the limelight from virtually nowhere, politically speaking. After winning the Ratmalana electorate by over 7,000 votes, it was only natural that he would be entrusted with a responsible Cabinet portfolio in keeping with his academic achievements.
The country's economy was in a shambles and the food shortages brought about by the faulty trade policies of the Sirima Bandaranaike government, had to be arrested, if the new government was to fulfill one of its primary election promises. JRJ had little hesitation in handing the important subject of Trade to Lalith, even though he was a novice to parliament. He went about his business with great aplomb putting right all the deficiencies and ensuring that the food shortages that characterized the previous government, causing its downfall, was eliminated.
This was only the beginning of what was to be a long and eventful political career during the next eleven years of the JRJ tenure, for this towering figure, culminating in him being entrusted with the high profile National Security Ministry, during the height of the Eelam war. It is here that Lalith shone the most, giving leadership in the prosecution of the war and personally visiting the battlefield to provide moral support to the soldiers. The inspirational speeches he made when visiting the men on the battlefield, no doubt, provided them with the will and courage to confront the enemy with added zest. It is no exaggeration to say that the Vadamaarachchi Operation, in 1987, was the high point in the political career of Lalith Athulathmudali. The LTTE was on the retreat and Prabhakaran on the verge of capture. Had the Indian government not intervened to thwart the effort, the Eelam war would certainly have been brought to an end at that stage and the tens and thousands of lives that were lost subsequently, averted, not to mention the vast destruction caused all round.
It would certainly have made Lalith a hero of the entire nation which mantle though went to Mahinda Rajapaksa 22 years later after much blood was spilled, in the intervening period.
That Lalith was a patriot to the core was not in doubt and he was one of those in the Cabinet who stiffly opposed the Indo-Lanka Accord and boycotted the signing ceremony with Prime Minister Premadasa. This was also the time of the JVP's second uprising which took a most virulent form and Lalith was a victim of its consequences when he was almost killed in the parliament bomb attack which claimed life of a government minister.
Though Premadasa was the Prime Minister it was obvious that JR was grooming both Lalith and Gamini for leadership and due to this there was open competition between the trio not to mention friction. Both held important portfolios through which they strove to build their public profiles. It was the expectation of many that either Lalith or Gamini would be the obvious choice to succeed JRJ although Premadasa was the Prime Minister. However when Premadasa eventually prevailed, both Lalith and Gamini supported him at the Presidential election, a honeymoon that was all too short-lived, as subsequent events were to prove.
Twenty five years after his death there is still speculation as to the circumstances surrounding the assassination. True, Scotland Yard investigators who were got down by Premadasa declared that it was the work of the LTTE. But there are those who are yet not fully convinced. This is due to the fact that it was Lalith who masterminded the whole business of impeaching Premadasa and there was much bitterness and acrimony that followed the failed bid, not least due to the breakaway by the Lalith Gamini duo, together with a few other stalwarts from the UNP, to form another political party.
Lalith, no doubt, was a man in a hurry, and politically ambitious. But sadly, with his exit and that of Gamini Dissanayake the Grand Old Party was deprived of two giant leaders, the consequences of which it is still enduring.
