LSSP to hold day of protest to urge govt. to resign

The Lanka Sama Samaja Party (LSSP) has proposed to hold a day of national protest against the government in order to rally all anti-government forces to urge it to resign, General Secretary Prof. Tissa Vitharana said yesterday. “The LSSP will forward this proposal to the Joint Opposition today,” he said.
He said the large crowd at the Nugegoda rally proves the unpopularity of this government. We will continue this struggle until the government resigns.
“The government has begun a dictatorial journey now. It is crushing trade unions actions and student’s struggles continuously,” he said.
“All Ceylon Telecommunication Employees’ Union Vice President M. S. Mangala was abducted and later freed. But, we demand a full investigation from the government in this regard” he said. “We also urge the people of this country to boycott the Independence Day because this government has robbed the people of their independence. We received true independence only in 1972 when Sri Lanka became a Republic.Therefore, while most countries commemorate the day they became a republic, we have neglected it,” Prof. Vitharana said.
“The government is trying to spend US$ 400 million to purchase aircraft even when there is no war. The government has also allowed the United States to establish a base in Trincomalee to keep their war ships. The US wants to prevent China from becoming the most powerful nation in the world within the next 10 to 20 years. Therefore,the US is using Sri Lanka to achieve it’s aim,” Prof. Vitharana said.
Southern Provincial Councillor and Lanka Sama Samaja Party Media Secretary Ven. Baddegama Samitha Thera said one of the Deputy Ministers of the Yahapalana government is openly criticizing and attacking government servants. “Government servants are bound by various circulars and codes . We therefore condemn the attacks by politicians on public servants,” Ven.Samitha Thera said.
“President Maithripala Sirisena has promised to abolish the Executive Presidency and not to contest the Presidency again. However, his followers say he will be the next President of Sri Lanka. But,the UNPers have said that they have not reached such a decision. This shows the differences in the unity government,” the Thera added.
