Bus thief caught

A suspect who is alleged to have stolen a luxury bus worth Rs. 7 million, was arrested by the Special Crime Operation Unit of Mirihana Police yesterday.
According to Police, the suspect had taken the bus from the owner in Dehiowita, Awissawella after signing a contract promising to pay him Rs. 75,000 a month. But after a few days, the bus owner noticed that the suspect's mobile phone had been disconnected.
He had vanished with the bus within a few days. The bus owner complained about the incident to Mount Lavinia Police.
The Special Crime Operation Unit, on the orders of Western South DIG Wasantha Wickramasinghe, arrested the main suspect while hiding in a house in Seeduwa.
