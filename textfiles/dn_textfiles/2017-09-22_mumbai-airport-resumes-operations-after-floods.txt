Mumbai airport resumes operations after floods

Aircraft movements at the main runway of the Mumbai airport was restored Wednesday night after the airport operator removed the SpiceJet aircraft which had skidded after landing amid heavy rains in the city on Tuesday.
The operations at runway 09/27 resumed at around 11:30pm after SpiceJet Boeing 737 was moved to the paved area and subsequently to a hanger, a Mumbai International Airport Limited (MIAL) official said. In an exercise, which lasted for almost 24 hours, undertaken by the joint engineering team of national carrier Air India and the MIAL, the aircraft was removed from the runway at around 9:30 last night.
Nearly 180 flights were cancelled during the main runway closure period, which lasted for over 25 hours. (The Economic Times)
