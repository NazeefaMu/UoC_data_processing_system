‘Run for little hearts’, on Sunday

Run for little hearts, a fund raising campaign to construct a ten storey cardiac and critical care complex at the Lady Ridgeway Children's Hospital will be held at the Independence Square on Sunday, October 27 at 7 am.
It is organised by the Sri Lanka College of Paediatricians.
Consultant paediatric cardiologist, Dr. Duminda Samarasinghe said there are over 3000 children born with congenital heart disease and other serious ailments every year.
It is estimated that 1000-15000 children die every year due to lack of facilities for better treatment and medical care. Considering the need of the hour, a target of Rs. 2 billion has been earmarked for the project.
