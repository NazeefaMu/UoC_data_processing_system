Opposition Leader carrying  out his duties - Rajitha

Cabinet Spokesman and Health Minister Dr.Rajitha Senaratne said that incumbent Opposition Leader R.Sambanthan is the most suitable leader at the moment to assist the country in furthering its reconciliation mandate.
“At a time when the country is trying to win the peace by reconciling with the minority communities”, Senaratne said comparing the current context to the past, when people like A. Amirthalingam was also an Opposition Leader who represented the minority communities.
Responding to a question raised by a journalist at the Cabinet Press conference yesterday about the prevailing controversy over the position of Opposition leader in Parliament, the Minister said the Opposition Leader is carrying out his duties and there is no issues with that.
“There is no party called the Joint opposition. If possible ask them to make a statement in Parliament that they no more belong to the Sri Lanka Freedom party. If so, they will lose their MP’s positions”, Minister Senaratne said.
He said the Joint Opposition first wanted to make issues within the government and when that turned out to be unsuccessful, they are now trying to take up the position of the Opposition Leader.
