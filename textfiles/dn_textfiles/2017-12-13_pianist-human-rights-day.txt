The Pianist for Human Rights Day

The International Centre for Ethnic Studies will screen Roman Polanski’s The Pianist at the ICES Auditorium on December 14 at 4.30 pm. The movie is the true-life story of brilliant pianist and composer Wladyslaw Szpilman, the most acclaimed young musician of his time until his promising career was interrupted by the onset of World War II.
This powerful, ultimately triumphant film follows Szpilman’s heroic and inspirational journey of survival with the unlikely help from a sympathetic German officer. A truly unforgettable epic, testifying to both the power of hope and the resiliency of the human spirit, The Pianist is a miraculous tale of survival masterfully brought to life by visionary filmmaker Roman Polonski in his most personal movie ever.
