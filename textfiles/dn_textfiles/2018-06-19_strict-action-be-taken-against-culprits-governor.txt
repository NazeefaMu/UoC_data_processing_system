Illegal acquirement of Sabaragamuwa lands
Strict action to be taken against culprits: Governor

Strict action would be taken against individuals who illegally acquire lands in the Sabaragamuwa Province, Sabaragamuwa Governor Niluka Ekanayaka said. She made these remarks after inspecting the access road to the Broadway City village in Parakaduwa which falls under the Kuruvita Pradeshiya Shaba, on Monday. It had been revealed that certain persons had illegally acquired roadside lands, especially those next to rural roads of the Province. Such constructions obstruct both pedestrians as well as the drainage system of the province.
