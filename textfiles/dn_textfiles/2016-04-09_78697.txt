What's Wrong with Sri Lanka Cricket?

Many Sri Lanka cricket fans are not happy with Sri Lanka cricket. Our mediocre performance in New Zealand, in the Asian Cup T-20 Tournament and in the T-20 World Cup made our cricket crazy people unhappy and disgusted. Fortunately, our cricket lovers do not descend to the level of damaging the houses of our cricketers when they do not deliver the goods. This shows that Sri Lankans are a great people and know how to face victory and defeat in good spirits. Hats off to our cricket fans!
To me there is nothing wrong with Sri Lankan cricketers. They are a very talented lot. They should be given opportunities to play together for quite some time. Changing players every now and then will not do any good for Sri Lanka cricket. My concern is about two veterans on our side, namely, Rangana Herath and T. M. Dilshan. I believe that they have to hang up their boots now. In another few years they will be too old to make a substantial contribution to the team
Therefore, it is better for them to retire gracefully and made way for another two up-and-coming youngsters. Then a young side can play for some time and eventually become an experienced team. There is a fear among the selectors to introduce young blood to the team. They think that youngsters may not perform well and become discouraged. If a young player is allowed to play in the national team, then he should be given a free hand to play his natural game. As well as this, assurance should be given to him that he will not be dropped from the team if he fails to deliver goods from the very first match. To gain experience and become a matured player, any cricketer needs time. Let the players play their natural game without any fear. If the selectors and coaches do not interfere with the players then they will show their real class and perform well.
Someone may question what is lacking in our national cricketers. The answer is very simple. Our players are not mentally fit. There are times when you have to handle pressure. But our cricketers are not able to do so when the occasion arises. Except for our skipper Angelo Matthews, the others do not have the ability to adjust to the situation. Cricket is not only a game of skill. It is also a mental game. Our players are not prepared mentally to handle pressure situations. If our cricketers are not psychologically in the proper frame of mind to show their natural talents, then Sri Lanka cricket will not go very far.
For example: Virat Koli of India and Dinesh Chandimal of Sri Lanka of Sri Lanka are both equally talented. Virat Koli knows how to handle pressure and play the game without panicking. When the situation is tough Chandimal becomes upset and plays a silly shot and sacrifices his wicket. He is totally unfit to handle pressure situations. It is the prime duty of the Cricket Board to see that our players are mentally fit to play this great game.
If men in authority do not see to this important aspect, then our standard of cricket will go from bad to worse. In Sri Lanka we have enough talent and a lot of players. But they are not in the frame of mind to handle difficult situations. This is something that must be remedied immediately. If not, then we cannot become a great cricket nation.
