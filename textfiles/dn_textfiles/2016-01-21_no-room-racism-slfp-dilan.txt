No room for racism in SLFP: Dilan

Parties instigating racism will be barred from joining any future political coalition led by the SLFP, Highways State Minister Dilan Perera said.
Speaking at a press conference at the Local Government and Provincial Councils Ministry on Tuesday, the minister said the decision of the SLFP is based on the stance of the central committee.
He said there was no division in the party but some difference in opinion.
