The Guru and the Disciple

The Bangladesh cricket team toured Sri Lanka in 2012-13. I was fortunate to witness the Second Test of this series played at Kettarama Stadium, with a friend of mine called Ravi who was holidaying here in Sri Lanka. Ravi and we had a friendship dating back to our College days at Ananada in the late sixties. He was and still is a diehard cricket fanatic and a wonderful photographer to boot. It was interesting to note that the journey we took from my digs at Mt Lavinia to Kettarama by bus was interesting to say the least, Ravi was so trigger happy; that even before we reached the stadium he had finished half his quota of photographs.
He was obviously fascinated by the dust, grime and squalor which pervaded the areas on that route. Once we reached the nearest bus halt to the stadium we extricated ourselves from the crowded bus and we were lucky to disembark in one piece. Ravi was fortunate to realise that his pocket was not picked in the melee.
Such was the situation that was prevalent in Sri Lanka at the time and now worse still.
By the time we reached the stadium the scenario changed completely to calm after the storm and the guru Sangakkara and the disciple Dinesh Chandimal treated us to a feast of “Cricket lovely Cricket.”
Kumar Sangakkara and Dinesh Chandimal soaked up two sessions of absorbing cricket at the R Premadasa Stadium, on day two of the second Test Match between Sri Lanka and Bangladesh.
It was a treat to watch the veteran Sangakkara shepherding young Chandimal, thus enabling Sri Lanka to get out of a rut at 60 odd runs for 4 wickets.
The pair added 195 priceless runs to the Sri Lankan cause. Sangakkara played an innings that reminds us of the old world charm, his shot selection was exquisite and he punched holes in the region between between mid wicket and mid on at will, when the Bangladeshi bowlers fell short of the mark. He also paced his innings to perfection, smothering the Bangladeshi spinners who time and again kept on pegging on a good length. His innings was all the more valuable since the track at R.Premadasa was not conducive to flamboyance, which is a hall mark of Sangakkara's batting.
Chandimal on the other hand, was the more aggressive of the two especially during the early part of the partnership.
He was never short of ideas when to score runs, at times coming out of his crease like a panther to hoist spinners over deep mid on and deep mid-off and also laying back on the back foot and steering the ball square on the off side. Already young Chandimal has scored consecutive centuries during the present Test Series with Bangladesh. He obviously has shown us that the latent talent of his, plus the runs on his score book has enabled him to come top of the pops among the young talent, which we have in abundance.
Coming back to the partnership it was noted that when Sangakkara reached his eighties he switched roles and became the aggressor playing pleasing drives through mid off and mid on to reach a well deserved century, thereby completing a third century in ten days.
This was Sangakkara's 33rd Test hundred which put him in 7th place in the all time list one behind Gavaskar and Lara.
The Guru that is Sangakkara still must be having ideas of surpassing a few milestones as he chugs along the road to stardom. As for the disciple that is Chandimal, who tends to take the bull by the horns, has the correct attitude, in my book.
After the days play, Ravi and I was observing the reactions of the crowd, a few were sloshed to their gills with beer, complete strangers were showing unusual camaraderie some were heading for places where their high spirits would end up doing the ‘Kabaraya.”
The fans of Sanga and Chandimal were seen to be in high spirits most of them losing their way to the exits in the process.
Ravi who has a fair complexion by nature was looking florid after the roasting he got from the Sri Lankan sun.
After tucking in many photographs he turned to me and said he thoroughly enjoyed the match as we passed the exit gate.
