Citibank, CCC begin second phase of rural economic programme

The ‘Rural Economic Empowerment Programme initiated by Citibank in collaboration with the Ceylon Chamber of Commerce (CCC) and Hatton National Bank in June 2015 assisted over 400 rural entrepreneurs in four rural villages
These villages are Beralapanathara in Matara District, Dadayamkanda in Ratnapura District, Weheragala in Anuradhapura District and Udappuwa in Puttalam District.
The project provided business management training as well as technical training and facilitated financial assistance to the needy entrepreneurs through HNB.
The assistance provided helped rural entrepreneurs who had not had any formal training on business management before to plan and conduct their businesses in a more organised manner and expand their businesses using the financial assistance extended by HNB.
Satisfied with the success of the first phase of the project, Citibank decided to continue its partnership with the Ceylon Chamber of Commerce and Hatton National Bank to uplift the livelihoods of people in rural areas by implementing a second phase of the project targetting a few more remote villages of the country.
The second phase will focus on the same objectives as the first phase with a different geographical coverage.
As in the first phase, Citibank will provide overall direction and financial resources, guidance and professional expertise for training and capacity building of prospective entrepreneurs for successful implementation of the second phase.
Citibank’s active support for this initiative epitomises its commitment towards promoting the livelihood development at grassroots level globally through sustainable financial inclusion. Citibank Sri Lanka together with Citibank Foundation has engaged in many CSR projects since its inception, demonstrating its dedication towards enhancing the economic opportunities for individuals and families of Sri Lanka and this project is a continuation of their CSR efforts to improve the businesses and living conditions of rural entrepreneurs.
Under the second phase, assistance is planned for entrepreneurs in a few remote villages in Galle and Anuradhapura Districts.
The Ceylon Chamber in collaboration with the Ministry of Agriculture of the Southern Provincial Council and the Galle District Chamber of Commerce has identified Maththaka, Niyagama, Poddiwela, Porowagama and Thalgaswala villages with a large number of rural entrepreneurs waiting for both management and financial assistance to improve and expand their businesses.
The second phase activities in Anuradhapura District began in collaboration with the North Central Provincial Council and the Anuradhapura District Chamber of Commerce. The project conducted the awareness session and baseline data collection of prospective rural entrepreneurs in Nochchiyagama and Nachchaduwa Divisional Secretariat areas with the participation of 55 and 56 beneficiaries respectively.
