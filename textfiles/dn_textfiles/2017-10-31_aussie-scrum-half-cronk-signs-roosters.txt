Aussie scrum-half Cronk signs with Roosters

Sydney: Australia Test scrum-half Cooper Cronk has signed a two-deal with the Sydney Roosters after leaving National Rugby League champions Melbourne Storm, his new club said Monday. Local reports said the deal was worth around Aus$2 million (US$1.5 million).
“The Sydney Roosters are a proud club with an esteemed history, and this is an exciting new opportunity for me,” Cronk said in a statement.
“It marks the start of a new chapter for me both professionally and personally and I look forward to joining my new teammates and coaches, and immersing myself in the club’s culture in lead-up to the 2018 season.”
Since announcing this year that he would leave after 14 seasons with Melbourne and move to Sydney for family reasons, Cronk has been in heavy demand. AFP
