Sala introduces The Boutique Capsule Hotel to Sri Lanka

The Boutique Capsule Hotel, owned and operated by Sala Enterprises which is Sri Lanka’s first-ever property under the ultra-modern ‘capsule’ concept, opened at Galle Road Colombo 3 recently.
With its all high-tech beds in 31 small cabins (capsules), the hotel is furnished with basic modern amenities for guests who need a clean, comfortable, safe and convenient stay.
Based on a popular Japanese theme, a capsule hotel, also known as a pod hotel, delivers the future of traveling with boutique-style accommodation to the new generation of travelers.
Inspired by the modern concept of “comfortable living at an affordable cost” in a global context of escalating prices, launching The Boutique Capsule Hotel in Sri Lanka to meet the growing demand from low budget visitors, was the idea of Chinthaka Wijewickrama, Chairman/MD of SALA Enterprises.
As a leading entrepreneur in the IT sphere, Wijewickrama is credited with introducing a galaxy of new products and innovations to Sri Lanka. He pioneered the launch of GPS Navigation, All in One PC, Sinhala, Tamil and English Key Board, Talking 12 language dictionary and many other products to the Sri Lankan market.
In line with the world-wide concept, The Boutique Capsule Hotel was developed in Sri Lanka with the core objective of providing cost effective, basic accommodation for guests, who either don’t require or cannot afford the services offered by more conventional hotels.
Though The Boutique Capsule Hotel offers a low cost accommodation option to guests, there is no compromising on comfort, quality or style. Featuring a terrace and shared lounge with spaceship-like interiors, the property offer guests free wi-fi, personal flat screen cable TV and individual AC control.
The shared bathroom has a hairdryer, free toiletries and a shower. Front desk services are available to guests around the clock.
Wijewickrama also wants to share his knowledge on capsule hotels with others and wants to take it island-wide.
