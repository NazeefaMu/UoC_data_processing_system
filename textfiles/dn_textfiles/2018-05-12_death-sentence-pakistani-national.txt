Death sentence for Pakistani national

A-48-year old Pakistani national who was found guilty of smuggling 8.35 kilograms of heroin hidden inside a container of imported potatoes in 2010 was yesterday sentenced to death by the Colombo High Court.
While handing out a judgment against the accused, High Court Judge Amal Ranaraja observed that the prosecutors have proved the accused guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.
The accused Saheed Mohammed had been arrested by Police Narcotics Bureau for committing this offence on or around November 23, 2010 in Colombo.
The Attorney General (AG) had indicted the accused under the Poisons, Opium and Dangerous Drugs (Amendment) Act No. 13 of 1984.
