SOME TEACHINGS OF JESUS FOR LENT SEASON: Seek and you will find

As all Christians and some Muslims around the world observe repentance during Lent that finally leads to the death of Jesus upon the cross, we all suffer from guilt being a part to the world's greatest miscarriage of Justice that is written in blood where history can never wipe Pilate's gruesome error against the innocent Jesus who two thousand plus years ago began his mission to save the world. His wholesome Ministry was filled with love, care, compassion, wisdom etc. for the humble as he went about preaching the Word of God.
Powerful but simple miracles
Let us take a look at some of them as recorded in the Holy Scriptures.
The eyes are like a lamp for the body. If your eyes are sound your whole body will be full of light but if you eyes are no good your body will be in darkness. So, if the light in you is darkness, how terribly dark it will be.
No one can be a slave to two masters. He will hate one and love the other. He will be loyal to one and despise the other. You cannot serve both God and man. ‘This why I tell you not to be worried about food and drink you need in order to stay alive or about clothes for your body. After all isn’t’ the body worth more than clothes. Look at the birds flying about. They do not sow seeds, gather a harvest and put it in the barn. Yet, your Father in heaven takes care of them. Aren’t you worth much more than the birds?
The narrow gate
‘Go in through the narrow gate because the gate to hell is wide and the road that leads to it is easy and there many who travel it. But the gate to life is narrow and the way that leads to is hard and there are few people that find it.’ Do not judge you in the same way as you judge others and he will apply to you the same rules you apply to others.
‘Ask and you will receive, seek and you will find, knock and the door will be open to you.
False prophets
‘Be on your guard against false prophets. They come to you looking like sheep on the outside but on the inside, they are really like wild wolves. You will know them by what they do. Thorn bushes do not bear grapes and briers do not bear figs. A healthy tree bears good fruit but a poor tree bears bad fruit. So, then will know bad prophets by what they do.
When Jesus finished saying these things, the crowds were amazed at the way he taught… He wasn’t’ like the teachers of the Law, instead he taught with authority. Jesus went up to the hill for rest and let people too rest.
Jesus bless little children
Some people brought little children to Jesus for him to place his hands on them and to pray for them but the disciples scolded the people. Jesus said, ‘Let the children come to me and do not stop them because the kingdom of heaven belongs to such as these.” and Jesus departed on his mission.
By morning when Jesus came down from the hill a large crowd had gathered and were ready to follow him. Among them a man suffering from a dreaded skin disease, came to him, knelt before him and said, ‘Sir, if you want to, you can make me clean. Jesus stretched out his hand and touched him, and said ‘I do want to'. At once, the man was healed from is disease. Then Jesus said to him, ‘Listen, do not tell anyone but go straight to the priest and let him examine you. Then in order to prove everyone that you are cared, offer the sacrifice that Moses ordered.
And Jesus proceeded with people following in awe, he got into a boat with his disciples when suddenly a great storm hit the lake and the boat was in danger of sinking. Jesus was asleep. The disciples woke him. ‘Save us lord’ they said, we are about to die.
‘Why are you so frightened? Jesus answered. How little faith you have. Then he got up and ordered the winds and the waves to stop and there was great calm. Everyone was amazed. ‘What kind f man is this?’ they said. Even the winds and the waves obey him.
After healing two men riddled with demons in the territory of Gadara on the other side of the Lake, Jesus got into the boat once again in his own town, when some people brought him a paralysed man lying on a bed. Jesus saw how much faith they had in him and said ‘Courage my son, your sins are forgiven'. Jesus knew what they were thinking and said, they are evil things. It is easier to forgive or to say, Get up and walk. I will prove to you then that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins. So, he said ‘Get up’ pick up your bed and go home'. The man got up and went home. When the people saw it, they were afraid and praised God for giving such authority to men.
A woman who had suffered severe bleeding for twelve years came up behind Jesus and touched the edge of his cloak. She said to herself, ‘If I only touch his cloak, I will get well. Jesus turned and saw her and said, ‘Courage my daughter, your faith had made you well. ‘At the very moment the woman became well.
Continues healing the sick and the suffering
The Son of Man never rested. He had very little time left to love, care and cherish before he completed his mission on earth. Jesus was a young man, only thirty three-years-old and was aware of it. As Jesus left the place again, two blind men started following and shouted, ‘Take pity on us, Son of David. When he went indoors, the two men came to him and Jesus asked them ‘Do you believe that I can heal you. ‘Yes, Sir’ they answered. Jesus touched their eyes and said, ‘Let it happen’ and their sight was restored. Jesus spoke sternly to them, ‘don’t’ tell this to anyone’ but they ran spreading the miracle news. After speaking about his suffering and death, and about the Parable of the lost sheep.
The lost sheep
‘What do you think a man who has hundred sheep and one of them gets lost?’ Jesus questioned ‘He will leave the other ninety nine grazing on the hillside and go and look for the lost sheep. When he finds it, I tell you, he feels far happier over this one sheep than over the ninety nine that did not get lost. Just the same way your Father in haven does not want any of these little ones be lost.
