Nimali determined to give better display in second leg

Sri Lanka’s Nimali Liyanarachchi who gave a disappointing display in the 800 metres event of the Asian Grand Prix first leg in Jinhua is determined to make amends and win a medal in the second leg which will be worked off in Jiashen, Eastern China on April 27.
Nimali finished a disappointing fifth with a time of 2 minutes 08:47 seconds in the first leg.
It was a huge disappointment for Nimali who had won the 800 metres event in the Asian Grand Prix on three successive occasions. She set up a Sri Lanka record in the 800 metres events in the National Sports Festival held in Jaffna finishing the event in a time of 2 minutes 03:50 seconds but she was unable to improve on it at recent meets.
Nimali said that she needed time to get accustomed to the cold climate in China and is confident of winning the Gold medal in the 800 metres event in the second leg by overcoming China’s Wang Chen who won the gold medal in a time of 2 minutes 03:25 seconds in the first leg and India’s Luca Tinto who won the Silver medal in a time of 2 minutes 03.59 seconds.
Nimali’s coach Sujith Nilantha said that Nimali’s poor display in the first leg was due to lack of practice and her inability to get accustomed to the cold climate but she should come off with flying colours in the second leg on Thursday.
Meanwhile, short distance runner Himasha Eshan who won the Silver medal in the men’s 100 metres event is confident of winning the Gold medal in the event in the second leg on April 27.
