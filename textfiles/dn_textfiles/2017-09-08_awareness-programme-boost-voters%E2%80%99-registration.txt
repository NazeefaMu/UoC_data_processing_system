Awareness  programme to boost voters’ registration

An awareness programme was conducted in the Puttalam district to speed up the voters’ registration, on Tuesday.
The programme was organised by Puttalam district election office at the request of Puttalam district Assistant Elections Commissioner B.M.I.S.L. Bandara. Officers visited many Grama Niladari divisions in the district and asked the people to check whether their names have been mentioned in the voters’ register.
Meanwhile, it has been reported that the registration of voters from Puttalam is low, compared with the other districts.
