SLC THWARTS MASSIVE FRAUD

Sri Lanka Cricket (SLC) had been able to successfully thwart a fraudulent attempt to transfer US$ 5.5 million of SLC’s Media Rights Sponsorship funds, which was due from an International Media Network; to an offshore account yesterday.
The fraudulent act was discovered, before it was executed through bogus means.
Issuing a statement, SLC said immediately upon finding of the attempted fraud, Sri Lanka Cricket’s CEO Ashley De Silva had lodged a complaint with the Financial Crimes Investigation Division (FCID) under the direction of the Sports Minister Faiszer Musthapa; last afternoon to probe the attempted fraud.
“Sri Lanka Cricket wishes to state here, while accepting that an act of this nature is highly damaging for an organization of international repute such as SLC, we are happy to note that due to the internal due diligence process of the SLC, we were able to avoid the fraud,” SLC CEO Ashley De Silva said.
Meanwhile, speaking to the Daily News the SLC Media Manager noted that Sri Lanka Cricket under the instructions of the CEO, has decided to launch an audit inquiry into all the financial transactions, conducted during the past year.
