‘MR has no connection with Treasury Bond issue’

A group of Joint Opposition parliamentarians held discussions with Central Bank Governor Indrajit Coomaraswamy yesterday on the alleged Treasury Bond scam.
Opposition Parliamentarian Bandula Gunawardane said the JO Parliamentarians had informed the CB Governor that former President Mahinda Rajapaksa was being falsely accused in the incident while presenting a bogus gazette notification.
Gunawardane said the CB Governor had told the group that there was no connection between former President Rajapaksa and the Treasury Bond issue.
The meeting with the Governor had gone on for nearly two hours. Apart from Gunawardane, Parliamentarians Dinesh Gunawardane, Dallus Alahapperuma, Prasanna Ranatunge and others had participated.
Gunewardane said the JO team informed the Governor that there was an unacceptable delay in taking action against those accused in the alleged Treasury Bond scam and had requested him to speed up probes conducted by the CB on the issue.
