Sri Lanka’s foremost and pioneering herbal personal care product manufacturer Swadeshi Industrial Works PLC’s Deputy Chairperson and Managing Director Deshamanya Chulodhara Samarasinghe was bestowed with the Best CEO and Leadership Gold award at the ‘Top 50 Professional and Career Women Awards’, seventh edition.

The theme of the 2017 edition was; ‘Beyond parity – Developing tomorrow's Women Leaders'. The highly prestigious accolade conferred upon Chulodhara thus was a fitting tribute towards her potency in managing both her professional and personal lives with equal tranquility and right spirit.
Chulodhara has an illustrious professional career. Joining Maritime holdings, Hayleys PLC in 1995 as a Management Trainee had been her initial move towards consolidating herself as a professional in the corporate sector. By handling a large base of clients in the imports and exports sectors and logistics elevated herself to the post of an assistant manager within a short spell.

“Today’s managers should be uber-proactive to add value to their companies. Stiff competition prevailing in the corporate sector pose us with both challenges and golden opportunities and we as managers should have the forecasting prowess to keep challenges at bay and seize opportunities to drive our companies towards greater heights”, “These have been challenging times but with a never give up attitude and support received from my team at Swadeshi and other important colleagues gives me greater self satisfaction and courage to move forward taking Swadeshi to greater heights in the future”. said Chulodhara.
“I intend to take Swadeshi brands to new heights with a focus on overseas markets and introduce more natural skin care herbal therapy products from Sri Lanka to the Swadeshi product portfolio.
I also have a passion towards educating future generations on the value and importance of life and compassion for all beings including animals. To have my own sanctuary for rescued animals is something that tops my wish list”, said a contented Chulodhara.
