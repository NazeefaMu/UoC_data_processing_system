Club football in Kandy has hit rock bottom
When will Kandy football reach its past glory? Kandy enjoyed the glory of the best sport played by the British in Ceylon – soccer during the early years. Now this sport is on the decline and one wonders whether Kandy's football will ever regain its former glory? For the last four years, the tournaments are not properly organized. In the good old days they start with inter club 7’s, then league and end it with the knockouts. In the past few years they played only a knockout tournament which was not completed. Presidents and officials come and go but the game is at a standstill.
