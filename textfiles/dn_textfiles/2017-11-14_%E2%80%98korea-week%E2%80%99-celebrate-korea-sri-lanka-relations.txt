‘Korea Week’ to celebrate Korea-Sri Lanka relations

The Korean Embassy in Sri Lanka is organising a variety of programs for ‘Korea Week’ which will be held from November 13 to 20. The event is organized to celebrate 40 years of diplomatic relations between Korea and Sri Lanka. The embassy hopes to bring new aspects of Korean culture to Sri Lankans through these events.
Starting the week, the 40th Anniversary Reception will be held at the BMICH Banquet Hall on November 14, followed by the world famous non-verbal performance of NANTA at the BMICH Main Hall.
The Korean Film Festival 2017 will be held at the National Film Corporation from November 17 to 20. The Korean Speech Contest will be held at the New Arts Theater, University of Colombo on November 18 at 8 am. The contest is organized by the Korea International Cooperation Agency (KOICA) Sri Lanka office. Following the introduction of Korean dramas and K-pop in Sri Lanka the ‘Korean Wave’ has been spreading around the country. Many Sri Lankans, including younger generations who are interested in Korean culture and language, are studying Korean. The 10th Korean Speech Contest in Sri Lanka will provide a valuable opportunity for Sri Lankans to demonstrate their Korean language skills.
A TV Documentary on Bilateral Ties will be broadcast on November 18 on Rupavahini Channel. The fifty minute television documentary titled “Friendship of Four Decades” will review the bilateral cooperation across a whole range of areas of mutual interest, spanning the political, economic and development cooperation spheres and explore the way forward for a future-oriented relationship between Korea and Sri Lanka.
The Korean Ambassador’s and Kukkiwon Cup Taekwondo Championship will be held at the Sugathadasa Indoor Stadium on November 25 at 3.30 pm. The Kukkiwon (World Taekwondo Headquarters) Demonstration Team visiting Sri Lanka for the Championship will give a demonstration. Preliminaries will take place from November 11 to 14 at the Sports Hostel Complex, Ministry of Sports, and the final championship will be held on November 25. The Taekwondo Championship 2017, jointly organized by the Korean Embassy and Sri Lanka Taekwondo Federation, will promote and develop Taekwondo in Sri Lanka.
The friendship between Korea and Sri Lanka has been nurtured over a period of four decades. At this meaningful time, Korea Post has collaborated with the Ministry of Posts, Postal Services and Muslim Religious Affairs of Sri Lanka to issue Commemorative Postage Stamps. It is hoped that the variety of programs scheduled during ‘KOREA WEEK’, celebrating the 40th anniversary of diplomatic ties between the two countries, will serve to enhance relations between Korea and Sri Lanka.
