Participatory path to irrigation management

Irrigated agriculture – the largest water consumer of the country, is facing severe challenges today. The bet challenge in the near future is how to produce more food and enhance farmer income with less water. The Government of Sri Lanka makes massive investments for development and improvement of irrigation infrastructure in the context of rising demand for water.
More than two thirds of the country’s total land area, which lies in the Dry zone is not productive without the provision of irrigation water. Therefore in the past, investment in irrigation have been concentrated on constructing new irrigation systems or restoring ancient tank systems in the Dry zone, which once supported the ancient civilization. Participation of farmers in irrigation systems construction, operation and maintenance has been one of the key aspects in irrigated agriculture since ancient times. This being an obligatory requirement during the time of ancient kings was called Rajakariya (work performed by the people to the king). Rajakariya was a service done for the king without payment. People got land from the king for cultivation. In return, they performed a compulsory service to the king. However, after the commencement of the British rule in 1796, they abolished the Village Councils and consequently the Rajakariya in 1833.
Irrigation infrastructure
After gaining independence in 1948, large proportion of public investments were allocated to Irrigation Department, mainly for new constructions. The development of large amounts of irrigation infrastructure demanded massive resources as recurrent expenditures. Unlike in community based irrigation systems, where the responsibility for maintenance rested with the user as incentives for maintenance and benefits were localized: in the government intervention systems farmers expected maintenance by the government bureaucracy. Thus there developed a gap in the resource requirement for irrigation system maintenance between bureaucracy and beneficiaries. Therefore since 1978 the government of Sri Lanka started experiments on farmer participation in irrigation system management and handing over of operation and maintenance (O&M) responsibilities to Farmer Organization (FOs) or Water Users Associations. In other words, prior to 1978, all major and medium irrigation schemes in Sri Lanka were managed by the government with little involvement of farmers.
Irrigation policies may be broadly divided into two categories; (a) irrigation development polices and (b) irrigation management policies. Irrigation development policies may be further divided into for discussion, two categories namely, (i) supply augmentation policy and (ii) system improvement policy.
As regards supply augmentation policy moves, since independence in 1948, the major government efforts for economic development in general and agricultural development in particular have been directed at the development of irrigation sector. The rationale for this policy has been that the development of the irrigation infrastructure is the fundamental strategy for increasing food production in Sri Lanka. More than two thirds of the country’s total land area, which lies in the Dry zone, is not productive without the provision of irrigation water. Therefore in the past, investments in irrigation have been concentrated on constructing new irrigation systems or restoring ancient tank systems in the Dry zone which once supported the ancient island civilization.
The research reveals that investment in irrigation rehabilitation has shown a rapid increase after 1980s, with the implementation of several rehabilitation projects such as Tank Irrigation Modernization Project (TIMP), Village Irrigation Rehabilitation Project (VIRP), Major Irrigation Rehabilitation Project (MIRP), Irrigation system Management Project (ISMP), National Irrigation Rehabilitation Project (NIRP), and Mahaweli Rehabilitation and Reconstruction Project (MRRP).
Irrigation management policies may be divided for discussion, into two categories namely (i) user fee and (ii) farmer participation.
Irrigation cost
The findings of the early research revealed that government of Sri Lanka has failed to make necessary policies to mobilize sufficient resources from irrigation beneficiaries to ensure proper maintenance of expanded and improved irrigation infrastructure. The allocation made from government for Operation and Management (O&M) has also decreased over the years at real prices. Direct charging for water was politically very sensitive and has caused severe negative consequences for ruling parties in the past. However historically there had been several instruments used by the government to collect revenue for the State to meet part of the irrigation cost.
With regard to user fees, as indirect tax does not appear to provide any incentive to use the water resources efficiently. The government of Sri Lanka has made several attempts to collect irrigation fee directly from water users. According to the economic theories, pricing of services or commodities is needed to ensure the optimum resource allocation in production. Water pricing methods can be based on volume of water consumed or extent under cultivation. In Sri Lanka O&M fee implemented was based on the area of land cultivated irrespective of the volume of water consumed. In economic efficiency terms, area based pricing is not efficient because famers are inclined to use as much as possible water for the given fee in the absence of physical, administrative, legal or social restrictions, to prevent them.
Irrigation Ordinance No.48 of 1968 as amended provides for the imposition of an irrigation rate upon lands benefited under any season.
The government imposed a land tax, but collections were minimal since 1978. In 1984, the government introduced an O&M fee in all major irrigation schemes with the promise of improved irrigation services. The need to collect O&M fee arose from the enability of the State to generate and allocate sufficient fund to operate and maintain major irrigation schemes at optimal level.
The direct consequence of the failure to allocate sufficient funds for O&M in the long run has resulted in rapid deterioration of irrigation infrastructure. Free collection started with promising result, but did not last long. For example, by the end of 1986, only 15% of the fee for 1985 had been collected.
The collection rates for 1986 fees stood at only 11%. One reason for the failure may have been the acts of opposition political parties to translate the fee collection as an attempt to privatize the irrigation system. Fee collection also suffered from a variety of implementation problems. They included the inability of linking the collected revenue from the system improvement, weak enforcement mechanism adopted for fee collection failure to take action against defaulters and adoption of a uniform rate of O&M fee collection for all the scheme without considering the water availability and physical conditions of a given scheme.
The failures of past attempts in the collection of O&M fee demanded and alternative policy for the substainable and efficient management irrigation infrastructure and management of water resources. After a series of experiments and experiences of participatory irrigation management (PIM) the pressure from doner agencies to reduce public expenditure on irrigation system O&M, the government made attempts to introduce PIM as a national policy.
The Cabinet of Ministers agreed in principle on PIM in 1989, but it has been approved as a policy only in 1992. The government expected to reduce the cost of irrigation O&M by 50% through the policy of PIM as stipulated in the Cabinet Memorandum of 1989.
The legal backing for FOs had earlier been granted by the Agrarian Services Act. PIM for major irrigation had been approved legally by an amendment to the Irrigation Ordinance in 1994.
