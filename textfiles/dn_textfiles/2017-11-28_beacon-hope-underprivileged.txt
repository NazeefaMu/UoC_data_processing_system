Beacon of hope for the underprivileged

Zainab Ifthikar is a first year medical student at Al Faisal University in Saudi Arabia who was introduced to the world as an author in 2015 through her book ‘Poverty Is Not Passivity’.
Later in 2016 she founded her own NGO called the MEI Foundation which stands for motivation, encouragement and inspiration. Zainab’s profound love for philanthropy and her commitment to community services continues to empower her ongoing effort to contribute to the society with utmost passion.
On November 8, Zainab organized an event at Dehiwala, Colombo, to donate stationary items and rice to 100 children who come from underprivileged families. The event was a huge success and she had lit a beacon of hope in the children’s eyes. In the speech she delivered, Zainab had acknowledged the plight of those children across the globe who yearn for equality of opportunity.
She stresses on the importance of paying attention to the development and caring of children who are the future of a nation and the hopes of the present day life.
