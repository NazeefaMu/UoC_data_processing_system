Public transport information on Google Maps

Information on public transport in Sri Lanka will be added to Google Maps for the convenience of local and foreign tourists.
National Transport Commission (NTC) Chairman M. A. P. Hemachandra, addressing a media briefing in Colombo yesterday, said the data included departure times, ticket fare and routes for long distance inter-provincial private buses operated by NTC, SLTB buses, trains and buses operated by Road Passenger Transport Authorities in Western and Southern Provinces in the initial stage.
Data of all public transport modes will be included in Google Maps in the future.
Users will know the travel fare for each distance, real-time departures and routes and it will also reveal the number of interchanges.
For each journey, the app compares all available routes via different transport modes to see which is the quickest or easiest.
Alternatively, users can pick their preferred mode of transport and select the minimum number of changes.
Once a route is selected, Google will tell them which stop they need to get off and show the stop on a map.
This is the best way for passengers, especially foreign travelers, to look up timetables and ticket fares of each public transport mode, he added.The chairman added that a new bus fare policy will be formulated to regulate normal bus, air-conditioned bus and super luxury bus operations soon. Meanwhile, a new card system, which is an electronic pre-paid travel card, will be introduced, allowing passengers to make bus ticket payments without the hassle of carrying cash.
