Postscript  to Dale  Carnegie

Titled in lower case, think and grow rich brings capital to any reader if digested in the correct mood. My lament is that I came across this valuable life guide in the very evening of my life and I have never read a review of this most inspirational book anywhere in print or never a voracious reader made me aware of this book till I made my second visit to Australia. A PhD holder from Queensland University of Technology just offered me this priceless book on financial management and psychology which has been first published in 1937, to while away my time. Yet, on the following day, my daughter took me to a well-established book shop in Westfield Shopping Mall to find a copy of this book for my own use which I possess now and read reread and ponder because of its indescribable impact on me. I thought of reviewing it in this esteemed paper for the wider use of the enterprising young entrepreneurs for them to harness the much quintessential value of this great effort of Napoleon Hill and the reviser Arthur R.Pell, for the uplift of the Sri Lankan business community in particular and their counterparts elsewhere.
Napoleon has been a contemporary of Dale Carnegie. It is a book that goes far beyond boundaries of time and versatile in money making.
Its authenticity reposes in Hill’s painstaking endeavor of interviewing around 500 most successful men and women in the tapestry of financial management leading to great riches.
He has unearthed the secret of money making in his effort for the benefit of the wider business community. The book leads the people to join the super-successful entrepreneur elite.
The writer enlivens the achievements of the great giants in the sphere of industrial sector such as Henry Ford, Thomas Alva Edison, F W Woolworth and some others that that provides ample food for thought and the reviewer Pell takes recent success stories of Bill Gates, Spieldberg and some others that the reader could meet in his perusal through the lines.
Hill makes an array of immortal rules for the people to follow if they want to succeed in wealth making.
The pith of the matter is that one has to nurture desire with a definite purpose coupled with an action plan to achieve it. The power of thought is the predominant factor. Yet, the starting point of all achievement is the desire. According to Hill, faith is the cornerstone.
To derive the much needed business resourcefulness for the entrepreneur he or she has to absorb and imbibe digest the contents of this valuable guide.
It is priced at 19 US Dollars, but if it comes to the correct hands, the book could be the goldmine of the modern world. It is a must read even for the lay mind. In my view, it is a readable read due to its lucid writing.
