Dialog Axiata, Mastercard to accelerate  digital payment innovation in SL

Dialog Axiata PLC and Mastercard, the leading global payments and technology company, signed a strategic partnership agreement recently to drive the adoption of digital payments in Sri Lanka.
The partnership will enable opportunity for shared technology platforms and facilitate open loop payments, whilst accelerating the adoption of Mastercard’s digital payment solutions and expanding the reach and acceptance of its card-to-card payment provision. Mastercard will empower Genie, Sri Lanka’s first PCIDSS secure app by Dialog, with ‘Mastercard Integrated’ for processing, ‘Mastercard QR’ for low value merchant payments by using LankaQR, ‘Mastercard Digital Enablement Services’ for contactless payments, ‘Mastercard Payment Gateway Services’ (MPGS) for processing mCommerce transactions with tokenisation and other value-added services, paving the way for convenience and security for thousands of Sri Lankan merchants and their customers.
Mastercard and Dialog will extend various offers to consumers in collaboration, including exclusive cardholder promotions leveraging Dialog’s 20,000 strong merchant network.
Fariq Cader, Vice President - Digital Services, Dialog Axiata PLC said, “The growth of payments using connected devices has increased rapidly in the recent years, and through our platforms Genie and eZ Cash, we look forward to creating a secure and convenient way to transact, alongside with easing the interoperability of access for digital services.”
“The partnership will also provide access for the unbanked population using eZ Cash.”
“Dialog’s wide customer base and strong presence across the island will help us extend the convenience and security offered by our cutting edge electronic payment solutions to more Sri Lankan businesses and consumers. Working together, we are committed to driving the adoption of mobile payments in the country,” said R. B. Santosh Kumar, Country Manager – Sri Lanka and Maldives, Mastercard.
