Lanka world’s first in breastfeeding: UNICEF

Sri Lanka is the first in the world in breastfeeding according to indicators. The population statistics re-confirmed this status, UNICEF Health and Nutrition Officer Dr. Dhammika Rowel said.
She was addressing a press conference held at the Health Promotion Bureau in Colombo yesterday. She said breastfed infants develop confidence and their IQ level increases to over 10 points. A child’s brain grows during the first three years in his or her life and breast milk helps them to become confident, energetic and healthy adults.
Breastfeeding working mothers should be given daycare facilities by state and private institutions, she added.
Health Promotion Bureau Director Dr. Paba Palihawadana said breast milk increases immunity of infants while protecting the mother from breast and ovarian cancers. Breast milk reduces the risk of developing Non Communicable Diseases (NCDs) when infants become adults. All infants should be breastfed during the first six months without any other liquid or food. Dr. Palihawadana said breast milk is the best food that can be given to an infant during traveling, when facing a natural disaster and when the mother or child falls sick.
Consultant Gynecologist Dr. U.D.P. Rathnasiri said breastfeeding reduces the risk of developing Postpartum Depression (PPD) in mothers. If mothers do not breastfeed, it can lead to various complications when the milk is collected in the breasts. Breastfeeding can also cut down the risk of developing Type 2 diabetes in mothers.
