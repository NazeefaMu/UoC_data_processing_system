No SRK, Salman or Deepika in Farah Khan’s next

Farah Khan is not only a great choreographer but also a renowned director. All her films till now have been big budget ones with A listers. Be it Om Shanti Om, Main Hoon Na or Happy New Year, all the films have a Shah Rukh Khan or a Deepika Padukone or someone. But her next film will not have a star! So don’t expect a Shah Rukh or Salman or Deepika Padukone in her next.
In fact, her next movie is going to be a woman oriented film. As Farah told IANS recently, “I have written a script and this time it’s a small script, and it’s not star-driven. It’s a two girls project so still waiting for it to happen because I have not put a big star in it.”
Farah has a good reason for not having stars in her next. The filmmaker said, “The thing is stars make it easier for the project to be green-lit. Otherwise, everyone will question your script 100 times if you have a star saying yes to it give that newspaper cutting and nobody will ask any question that’s the good side and a bad side to it.”
