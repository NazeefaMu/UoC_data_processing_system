Nick Jonas developing his first play

Nick Jonas recently recruited his celebrity pals to read his first play ‘Dessert First’ in front of industry executives.
According to a report by Variety.com, the actor/singer started trying his hand at playwriting while filming 'Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle' a year ago, and has been developing the project, his first dramatic play, via a new production company he has set up to create his own vehicles.
On September 14, Nick hosted a table read at the Chateau Marmont in Los Angeles for a host of industry executives, and recruited his famous friends to read his script, including 'Glee's Darren Criss, 'The Vampire Diaries' Nina Dobrev, funnywoman Molly Shannon, Ballers' Omar Miller, and Pirates of the Caribbean actor Damian O'Hare, as well as Irish theatre actor Killian Donnelly, best known for 'Kinky Boots', 'Les Miserables' and 'The Phantom of the Opera'.
Nick's fiancee, actress Priyanka Chopra, and brother Joe were in attendance to offer support while he debuted his work to three dozen studio executives and film producers, including La La Land producer Marc Platt, Sony Pictures’ creative production vice president Matt Milam, Amblin casting executive vice president Leslee Feldman, and Sony executive Maia Eyre.
It marked a busy weekend for the ‘Jealous’ singer, who turned 26. Recently Nick and Priyanka were joined by a group of friends at Angel Stadium in Anaheim, California to watch a baseball game.
Before the match, he got the chance to have a go at batting on the field, and afterwards, he performed at a fundraising show in honour of Strike Out Slavery, a nonprofit organisation fighting human trafficking, at the stadium.
The couple, who got engaged in July, capped off the weekend with more sports - heading to Texas to watch the Dallas Cowboys face off against the New York Giants at AT&T Stadium.
