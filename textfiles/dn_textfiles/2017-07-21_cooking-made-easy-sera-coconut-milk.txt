Cooking made easy with Sera coconut milk

Ceylon Biscuits Limited (CBL) formulated Sera, a smart and versatile solution. Sera is a premium liquid coconut milk, made available in convenient 180ml UHT packs.
The thickness and consistency of Sera coconut milk is no different from that of the first extract of the freshest and juiciest coconut and is devoid of artificial flavours, colours, additives and preservatives means that it will preserve the authenticity as well as the natural aroma, taste and texture of any curry.
What’s more, Sera comes with a shelf life of one year and this enables the product to be stowed away in large quantities in pantries, ensuring that it is close at hand at all times.
The secret to formulating long-lasting, thick, rich coconut milk lies in CBL’s state-of-the-art, precision-based manufacturing process, wherein kernels of coconuts of the highest quality are completely separated from their shells, and subjected to high temperatures followed by steam infusions and tetra packaging thereafter.
This effective process ensures that all the natural elements and flavour of the coconuts are locked in and that the product is safe and healthy for consumption over a long period of time.
