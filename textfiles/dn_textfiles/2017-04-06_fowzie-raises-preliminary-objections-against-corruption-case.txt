Fowzie raises preliminary objections against corruption case

National Integration and Reconciliation State Minister A.H.M.Fowzie yesterday raised preliminary objections against a corruption case filed by the Bribery Commission for allegedly causing a loss of Rs.1.07 million to the government by misusing a vehicle belonging to the Disaster Management Centre.
Accordingly, Colombo Chief Magistrate Lal Ranasinghe Bandara fixed for May 5 to deliver his order regarding the preliminary objections raised by defence.
President's Counsel Shavindra Fernando with counsel E.Candappa appearing for the State Minister raised preliminary objections on the basis of duplicity of charges.
The defence further informed Court that they were yet to receive certain documents pertaining to the case and thereby the case cannot be fixed for trial.
Meanwhile, the charge sheet consistent with four counts were read out to the State Minister by interpreter-mudliyar.
The Director General of the Commission to Investigate Allegations of Bribery or Corruption filed this corruption case against the State Minister under Section 70 of the Bribery Act on four charges.
The Bribery Commission alleged that State Minister Fowzie had unlawfully utilised a Land Cruiser Jeep belonging to the Disaster Management Centre between 2010 and 2015,while he was serving as a Senior Minister during the previous regime.
The value of the vehicle was estimated at Rs.19.5 million.
