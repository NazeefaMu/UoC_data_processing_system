DCC cannot cancel PC’s projects - SP Education Minister

The Galle District Coordinating Committee has no authority to revoke development projects initiated by the Provincial Council, Southern Province Education Minister Chandima Rasaputra said.
He made this observation at the council meeting held on Tuesday, in response to an inquiry by councillor Krishantha Puspakumara regarding the construction of a teacher training centre at Unawatuna, Galle.
Puspakumara said a temporary ban on the construction project was imposed at the DCC meeting following an argument over the project broke out. A decision had been taken to shift the project to other suitable location.
The District Coordinating Committee has no power to cancel a duly initiated project of Southern Provincial Council. However, only one chairman out of two Co-chairpersons had objected to the project and influenced for the cancellation of the project. The other co-chair had expressed his support towards the project, Rasaputra said.
"We regret over the move of the former. We will not cancel the project," he said.
