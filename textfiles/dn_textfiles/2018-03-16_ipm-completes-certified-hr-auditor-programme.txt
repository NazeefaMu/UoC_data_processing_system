IPM Sri Lanka - the Nation’s leader in human resource management, conducted its popular IPM Certified HR Auditor Programme in collaboration with TV Rao Learning Systems (TVRLS), India recently at the OZO Hotel in Colombo. The programme was held for 5 full days from Tuesday 27th February to Saturday 3rd March, 2018. 26 Certified HR Auditors including international participants who passed out at the conclusion of the programme received their Certified HR Auditor qualification. The programme was well received by the participants who represented a wide cross section of private and public sector organizations.
“HR Auditors have a significant role to play in auditing the HR policies and procedures in an organization for the purpose of assessing and determining how and how much these contribute in attaining overall organizational goals” said Prof. Ajantha Dharmasiri-President, IPM Sri Lanka.
“In order to position the Nation as a powerful contender for regional investment, IPM Sri Lanka considers developing the skills of HR professionals to a globally competitive level as one of its prime responsibilities.
