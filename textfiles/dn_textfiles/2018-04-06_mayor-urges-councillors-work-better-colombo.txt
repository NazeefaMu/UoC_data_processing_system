New CMC’s inaugural meeting:
Mayor urges councillors to work for a better Colombo

The inaugural meeting of newly-elected Colombo Municipal Council (CMC) was held at the New Town Hall yesterday.
The United National Party (UNP) secured the highest number of votes in Colombo at the Local Government (LG) Elections held recently and former State Minister Rosy Senanayake became the first woman mayor of the CMC.
Delivering the inaugural speech, newly-elected CMC Mayor Rosy Senanayake invited all 119 councillors to join hands as one group to work to ensure that people living in Colombo enjoy better living standards. “In this journey we have to face various challenges,” she said.
She underlined the necessity of having a powerful central government to achieve the development goals of the CMC by adding that the good signs of a powerful central government were witnessed on Wednesday in Parliament.
“I am really proud to be the mayor of the CMC for two reasons. The CMC had been under the UNP since its inception, except for a short period, and I was able to become the first woman mayor of the CMC due to the continuous struggle carried out by us to ensure 25 percent female representation in local government bodies,” Senanayake said.
She further added that making Colombo the capital city of reconciliation where there are no racial or religious issues is the first goal of the CMC.
The decision to hold CMC meetings at the New Town Hall until the construction of a new council chamber in the CMC at the Town Hall premises was taken with the approval of the Attorney General.
The number of councillors within the Colombo Municipal Council has increased to 119 from 55 and the seating facilities available at the existing chamber are not sufficient for this number.
