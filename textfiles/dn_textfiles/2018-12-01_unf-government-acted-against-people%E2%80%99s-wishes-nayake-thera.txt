Protesters disturb alms-giving at Lake House
UNF government acted against people’s wishes - Nayake Thera

The annual alms-giving ceremony held to commemorate the founder of Lake House D.R.Wijewardene, was disturbed yesterday morning by an agitation campaign held in front of its entrance by a couple of dozen people who called themselves activists from an organization called the Media Front for Democracy.
They shouted slogans of protest against the media institution while members of the Maha Sangha were chanting pirith in the boardroom.
The ceremony was held amidst this disturbance with the Maha Sangha invoking blessings on Lake House, its Founder late D.R.Wijewardene, the Chairman, the Board,the management and the staff.
The Sangha Nayaka of France’s Buddhist mission, Ven.Murungagasyaye Gnanissara Thera, told the participants of the alms ceremony, that Sri Lankans living in France have experienced and understood, better than those who are living in this country, the results of the previous government’s abominable and nefarious actions during its three years of rule.
Ven.Gnansissara Nayaka Thera said the people have become indisposed to the previous government’s nefarious commands cashiered by force and fraud and have decided to support Mahinda Rajapaksa because they have had enough of its abuse.
“The majority of journalists have found the culture of that government repulsive.The rulers of that government were selling the country’s national assets. They put up the country, its culture, heritage and its values for auction,” the Thera said.
“If they ever said that they were not selling any national assets, that is exactly when they were actually doing it. They were lying through their teeth right from the beginning,” he said.
“They have inflicted much damage and disrepute on the Maha Sangha in the last three years. The members of the Maha Sangha are taking a breather only now,” he said.
Ven.Gnanissara Nayaka Thera said Lake House as a media institute that has stood its grounds for over a century has a duty to act with responsibility to ensure that it will contribute to the pacification of the current situation in the country.
“This institution must lead the way to protect the nation, the country and its welfare,” he said.
A residential monk of Fort Sambuddhaloka Vihara and Colombo District Pirivena Education Director Ven. Vitharandeniye Medhananda Thera said here inasmuch as the people of this country, they too, as the members of the Maha Sangha had to undergo difficulties under the previous government.
“The previous government was not at all people friendly. Now that it has been put away with a new government, the people have new expectations.” he said.
He said the current unrest in the country can be solved through a General Election. “We offer our blessings for an election that should bring peace,” Medhananda thera said.
Lake House Editorial Director Dinesh Dodangoda and ANCL Legal Director Rasanga Harischandra participated.
The ceremony was organised by the Lake House Welfare Division and SLPP trade union members.
