GramaShakthi comes to the fore

There are nearly 1.65 million smallholder farmers in Sri Lanka who are toiling on 2.3 million hectare of agricultural land. On an average, these smallholder farms operate on 1.2 hectare of land. For decades, these smallholders have continued with the age old agricultural practices with little innovation. Moreover, consecutive governments, apart from the fertilizer subsidy or ad hoc programmes for the encouragement of agriculture, had done very little to improve the farmer’s livelihood. Thus, his very existence swung like a pendulum from worry over subsidies to debt. This was until the government proposed the ‘Grama Shakthi’ programme.
Independent Consultant to the World Bank, UNDP and Global Environmental Facility (GEF) and former Senior Lecturer in Agriculture at the University of Peradeniya, Dr Arumugam Kandiah who recently returned to Sri Lanka from the United States, believes that the Grama Shakthi programme if implemented correctly, could significantly alleviate rural poverty and more importantly, make farming a profitable profession even to the smallholder.
Since 2014, he had been working with rural development and water management projects in the country, especially in the North, to uplift the most significant sector in the area - agriculture.
Why are they poor?
The Dry zone covers nearly two thirds of Sri Lanka’s land area, which is characterized by an annual rainfall ranging between 1200 and 1900mm with a distinct dry season from May to September. The Wet Zone in the meantime, receives a mean annual rainfall of over 2500mm without pronounced dry periods. The Intermediate Zone receives between 1900 and 2500 mm and has a short and less prominent dry season.
A significant proportion of these smallholder farmers are poor, particularly those in the dry zone of Sri Lanka, explained Dr Kandiah, while the reasons for this are many. For starters, the cost of entry into farming is high. He or she would have to purchase seeds, fertilizer, pesticides in addition to spending their money on labour for clearing the land and planting the crop. Most of these costs are met through agricultural loans which more often than not, lead to greater debts rather than profits.
Dr Kandiah further added that a lack of technical know-how, poor management of water, lack of marketing and sales of products in addition to improper storage, had worsened the situation for a smallholder farmer.
“The farmer today is a subsistence farmer and we have not been able to get him out of it” he said.
More importantly, the agriculture sector is yet to get the average farmer move away from just rice farming to grow more high value crops.
“This is the key. They could grow their rice, but they must also be able to grow other higher value cash crops, which would supplement their income.”
Despite these challenges however, agriculture; for a people who have always been inclined towards the land, could be a way out of poverty, said Dr Kandiah.
The Department of Census and Statistics had estimated the level of poverty in 2016 to stand at 4.1 percent; which had decreased from 6.7 percent in 2012/13. From 2002 to 2016, the poverty index had shown a downward trend. Thus in 2016, approximately 843,913 individuals were in poverty, compared 1.3 million in 2012, pointed out Dr Kandiah.
“Poverty reduction is closely linked to agriculture. There is good news and bad news here. The good news is that, (according to a World Bank study), agriculture had been an important driver of poverty reduction and which accounted for nearly one third of the decline in poverty over the past decade.”
Poverty reduction in Sri Lanka’s rural areas was driven by higher agricultural wages which grew annually by an average of 5.7 percent during 2006 to 2013 and caused rural poverty to fall rapidly than in other sectors, he said.
The bad news, however is that, there is a risk that these gains in the agriculture sector may not be sustainable if agriculture productivity does not improve and the sector does not start to modernize through diversification, commercialization and value addition.
‘Grama Shakthi’
It was to overcome such challenges that, Grama Shakthi was introduced; a flagship development programme launched by the President for a “Sustainable Sri Lanka,” with a robust economy free of all forms of poverty by the year 2030.
According to Dr Kandiah, Grama Shakthi granted top priority to agriculture with emphasis to small farmers. It also recognized that “rural development and agricultural development go hand in hand” and that the “farmer must be at the center of any poverty alleviation and rural development drive.”
It aims to build capacity, enhance farmers’ access to credit, improve marketing facilities and tax and duty concessions on essential agricultural equipment that are imported into the country.
In addition to this programme, the President has also launched the ‘National Food Production Drive,’ aimed at reviving agriculture and ensuring food security. The programme aims to bring about an agricultural rejuvenation and to sustainably continue agricultural production in the face of weather and climate related changes and challenges.
The Ministry of Agriculture, as a part of the National Food Production Drive, has launched a three-year programme called the National Food Production Programme, 2016-2018. This programme would focus on making the country self-sufficient in locally cultivated food crops such as Chilli, Onion, Potato, Maize, Cowpea, Kurakkan, etc. By this programme, the Government will help the farming community by providing scientific knowledge, infrastructure facilities and other agricultural inputs such as seeds and fertilizer required for food crop cultivation.
More importantly, the Grama Shakthi programme had decided to work within the existing government structures, such as the Grama Niladhari and District Secretariats, rather than create new institutions.
“We are happy that there is interest in agriculture and endorsement from the top,” said Dr Kandiah.
Agriculture is not just rice
Today, approximately 60 percent cultivate both paddy and upland crops and another 40 percent predominantly cultivate upland crops.
“Paddy cultivation ensures food security, but paddy is not a ‘cash crop,” said Dr Kandiah, as he added that it also required relatively large quantities of water, compared to upland crops. In the dry zone where water is a scarce commodity; paddy cultivation as seen in the recent past, was becoming difficult and uneconomic, even in irrigation schemes due to unprecedented and prolonged droughts.
Paddy remains the major crop to cultivate during the Maha (wet) season in the lowlands of the dry zone (except in the Jaffna Peninsula), but it is not the best crop to cultivate during the Yala (dry) season.
Dr Kandhiah thus was of the opinion that it was time to focus on diversifying the production structure, “Out of the relatively low value food crops and move towards high-value agriculture and promote agriculture exports.”
This is critical to sustaining income growths going into the future, accelerating poverty reduction and reversing the trend in increasing inequality, he added.
This would also mean that small farmers should be engaged growing more cash crops, namely, fruits and vegetables, which generate a higher income as compared to rice. This in turn, would need, “more intensive crop production, higher levels of technology, better crop management and investments in post-harvest management, marketing and better organized value chains overall.”
This will thus trigger employment growth and more productive jobs in rural areas. This shift would also imply a move towards a more high-value production structure, agro-processing and value addition activities and increased competitiveness, he explained.
Need for modernization
In many of the dry zone districts, nearly 40 percent are full-time, profit motivated farmers. However, despite cultivating potentially high value cash crops, many do not make sufficient profits, “The main reason being farmers continue to use traditional farming practices which are technologically outdated and unsustainable,” Dr Kandiah said.
Further, traditional farming practices waste water, overuse mineral fertilizer, produce sub-optimal yields and adversely has an impact on the environment. It is here that one of the projects of Grama Shakthi turns very useful - it is to introduce drip irrigation systems for small holder farmers. Dr Kandiah evaluated that this could potentially increase the crop yield by more than two-fold, save more than 50 percent of water required under traditional irrigation and increase cropping intensity to 300 percent, while greatly reducing adverse environmental impacts and vulnerability to climate change risks.
The programme’s “National Drip Irrigation Project” (NDIP), which aims at introducing drip irrigation technology and associated agronomic practices to small holder farmers nationwide, would benefit 9,000 small holder farmers from the five dry zone provinces, namely, Northern, North Central, Eastern, Uva, and the Southern Provinces.
In drip irrigation, water is applied precisely to the crop very near to its root system, minimizing any wastage. Each drop of water is used by the plant. The efficiency of water use is 95 percent compared to 45 percent under traditional surface irrigation. The degree of water saving varies with the design, type of the drip system, crops grown and management practices. On average, 50 percent of water could be saved. It is possible to achieve 70-80 percent water saving in perennial crops.
Drip irrigation also avoids heavy pumping of wells during dry months, thus, mitigating against serious risks of saltwater intrusion and related health hazards.
Additionally, the fertigation system that is used with this irrigation system, applies a measured amount of fertilizer close to the roots of each plant. As a result, the applied fertilizer is fully absorbed by the crop; ground water pollution is prevented with significant savings to the fertilizer cost of production.
Commercialization of small holder agriculture
Having taken out various loans to grow the crop, many smallholder farmers in this country find that they have limited opportunities to sell them. This results more often than selling the crop at a lesser rate than expected to the first buyer that comes along, thus perpetuating the cycle of poverty.
“Many of small holder farmers sell their commodities in markets that are less demanding, but also less rewarding, such as village markets or the “Pola” and road-side stands. Others sell through intermediaries, due to the small scale of their production, the high transaction costs involved in reaching more distant markets and their inability to comply with the requirements relating to volume, quality and timely delivery demanded by modern agricultural value chains. The multiple challenges faced by smallholders pose major obstacles that prevent them from integrating into rapidly evolving national and international markets,” said Dr Kandiah.
To overcome this problem, he proposed that alliances between farmers (farmer organizations) and private agribusinesses be promoted. Hence, turning him into an agribusinessman rather than simply a farmer, with the provision of technical assistance and business development training.
Farmers should be assisted to shift from purely production oriented farming to market-based farming, he said.
As a stepping stone in this direction, Dr Kandiah through the Grama Shakthi programme had asked that preliminary value addition centers be established. When it comes to the North, a dedicated economic centre in Jaffna to bring the farmer to market has been proposed. The preliminary value addition center he explained, would help the farmer sort out his goods and prepare them in the best possible way to fetch a good price. He is also working with the Industrial Technical Institute to introduce ways in which produce could be kept for longer period with minimum refrigeration.
“Many small holders are excluded from formal value chains, because formal value chains usually demand better or more uniform quality produce. Thus, formal value chains are traditionally linked to larger farms or more organized groups of small farmers to more commercial wholesalers and from there to supermarkets or exporters. This quality has been accentuated by the explosive growth of supermarkets in Sri Lanka. Many small producers are thus limited to markets characterized by low-quality products and low prices and low returns - hence a frequent concern is to find ways to integrate small producers into more modern value chains, both domestic and export-oriented.”
In addition, Dr Kandiah has also proposed a farm input supply centre be set up in every district- a one stop shop for all farming needs; from fertilizer to seeds, so that the farmers could concentrate more of their time on the field.
Working together with the Department of Agriculture, Dr Kandiah and his team have been conducting farmer awareness and training programmes in the North. These programmes also look to tailor make the training to suit the farmer’s needs,
“There is no blanket approach. You have some farmers who are doing very well for themselves, whilst others are struggling. So the former’s needs would be different to others, while they would just need a slight push. So we must take this into account,” he said.
Climate Smart Agriculture
Finally, as climate changes becomes the biggest challenge to agriculture around the world, focus had now shifted to Climate-Smart Agriculture (CSA).
CSA aims to tackle three main objectives: Namely sustainably increasing agricultural productivity and income; adapting and building resilience to climate change and reducing and/or removing greenhouse gas emissions, where possible.
“According to climatic predictions, Sri Lanka’s wet areas are turning wetter, while dry areas are turning drier, directly affecting the agricultural activities in the wet and dry zones. Annual rainfall is expected to increase by a minimum of 121 mm in the wet zone, droughts would be magnified, particularly in the intermediate and dry zones. Sri Lankan agriculture had already felt the effect of extreme weather events and climate changes, including, a slow but steady rise of temperature (0.01–0.03 °C per year); high-intensity rainfall resulting in landslides and soil and coastal erosion; salinity intrusion into soil and aquifers and increasingly extreme droughts.” CSA technologies and practices thus present opportunities for addressing climate change challenges, as well as for promoting economic growth and development of the agriculture sector for small-holder farmers.
Micro irrigation in general and drip irrigation in particular is CSA with regard to water management practices of small holding farmers engaged in the production of high cash value crops in the uplands. Adoption of CSA technologies such as drip irrigation, fertigation, mulching, use of organic manures, etc. would also require well-articulated knowledge management systems and improving small-holding farmers’ access to financial instruments, resources and markets. Capacity building, supporting the sharing of knowledge and experience, creating incentives through social, legal, institutional, or economic and market mechanisms, long-term strategic investments in infrastructure, productive capacity, improved products and services and public-private partnerships are essential to ensure that sustainable agriculture and CSA objectives are achieved and longer-term benefits delivered, said Dr Kandiah.
