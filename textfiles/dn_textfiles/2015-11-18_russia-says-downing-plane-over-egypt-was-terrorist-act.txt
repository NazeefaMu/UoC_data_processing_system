Russia says downing of plane over Egypt was 'terrorist act'

RUSSIA: The Russian plane crash in Sinai, Egypt, was caused by a terrorist attack as traces of explosives have been found in the wreckage of the plane, Federal Security Service director Aleksandr Bortnikov told President Vladimir Putin.
"We can say that that [Sinai plane crash] was a terror act," Bortnikov told Putin. According to the FSB chief, experts analyzed passengers' belongings as well as the parts of the plane. "After the examination on all these objects, we have found traces of a foreign-made explosive substance," Bortnikov said.
"During the flight, a homemade device with the power of 1.5 kilograms of TNT was detonated. As a result, the plane fell apart in the air, which can be explained by the huge scattering of the fuselage parts of the plane," he added.
This not the first time that Russia has faced "barbarous terrorist crimes, more often without apparent causes, outside or domestic," said Putin, referring to explosions at a railway station in Volgograd in December 2013. "We haven't forgotten anything or anyone," Putin said. "The murder of our nationals in Sinai is among the bloodiest crimes in [terms of] the number of casualties."
Vladimir Putin has vowed to find and punish the culprits behind the Sinai plane attack. "Our military work in Syria must not only continue.
