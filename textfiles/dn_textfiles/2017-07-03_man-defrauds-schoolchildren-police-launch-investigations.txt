Galle Police have begun investigations into a man who allegedly defrauded schoolchildren to the tune of Rs. 170, 000 by promising them jobs at a leading bank.
The man had called school principals at leading schools in the area and informed them of vacancies at a leading bank due to open in Galle.
The man in question had asked the school principals to inform their senior students of the job vacancies and left his name and number with the school principals.
The students who responded to the opportunity were asked to deposit Rs. 43, 000 as an advance to a bank account provided by the suspect.
Police said the suspect had accrued Rs. 170, 000 from a number of students before suspicions were raised.
 Galle Police have begun investigations to track down the man suspected of defrauding schoolchildren in Galle.
