Kabaragala Ela bridge needs repair

There are no side railings on the bridge across the Kabaragala Ela on the Balangoda-Meddekande road, which is in a dilapidated condition. One bus serving the route, as well as several lorries transporting green leaves, other heavy and light vehicles, and a large number of residents including school children, all cross the bridge during their daily work routines.
The bus crosses the bridge dangerously with one of its rear wheels on either side jutting off the bridge. Residents in the area lament that this bridge, which is nearly 100 years old, has not been rehabilitated in recent years.
They request authorities to pay attention to this shortcoming and order immediate repairs to this bridge, which serves a large number of people in the area.
