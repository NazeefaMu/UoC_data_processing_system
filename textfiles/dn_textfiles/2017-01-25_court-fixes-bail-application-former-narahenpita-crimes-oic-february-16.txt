Court fixes bail application of former Narahenpita Crimes OIC for February 16

The Colombo High Court yesterday fixed for to consider the bail revision application filed by former Narahenpita Crimes OIC Sumith Champika Perera who was arrested and remanded over his alleged role in the cover up of evidence in the former rugby player Wasim Thajudeen murder.
When the revision application came up before High Court Court, the Attorney General raised objections to release the suspect on bail citing police were yet to conclude their investigations into Thajudeen’s murder case.
Through the revision application, former Crimes OIC sought an order against the Colombo Additional Magistrate’s refusal to enlarge him on bail and argued that there is no justifiable reason to do so.
The petitioner said the Colombo Additional Magistrate had refused to release him on bail on a number of occasions since he had been charged for conspiring to commit a murder. The petitioner said there is evidence to prove that he was not involved in conspiring to commit a murder and thereby moved Court that he be released on bail. The former Crimes OIC said he had acted in accordance with the instructions given by higher ranking police officers and did not commit anything wrong.
The prosecution maintained that there is a suspicion that the suspect had been involved along with the main suspects to commit this murder since the circumstantial evidence has suggested that the suspects had done their investigations to record Thajudeen’s death as a fatal road accident.
Senior Counsel Ajith Pathirana with Harin Hettiarachchi appeared for the petitioner. Senior State Counsel Suharshi Herath appeared for the Attorney General.
