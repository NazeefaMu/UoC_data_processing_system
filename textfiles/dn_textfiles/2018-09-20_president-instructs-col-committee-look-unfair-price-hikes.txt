President instructs CoL Committee  to look into unfair price hikes

The President has instructed the Cost of Living (CoL) Committee to look in to the unfair increase in food items following the increase in fuel prices, Lands and Parliamentary Reforms Minister Gayantha Karunathilake said.
Responding to a question raised by a journalist that the living standard of people has gone up, the Minister said the government has reduced the prices of several essential items.
Health and Indigenous Medicine Minister Rajitha Senaratne said that the price of fuel and food items are low when compared to the rule of the former government.
He further said that Budget 2019 will be a people friendly one. When asked about the Review Committee appointed under the Chairmanship of the Prime Minister to look into the Provincial Council Delimitation Report, Minister Senaratne said the Committee will meet this week and all party leaders have agreed to attend the meeting.
