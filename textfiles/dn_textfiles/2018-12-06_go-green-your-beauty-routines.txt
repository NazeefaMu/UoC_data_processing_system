Go green with your beauty  routines

Not many of us would have given this cactus-like plant a second glance years ag. However aloe vera, also described as a ‘wonder plant’, is known for its numerous health and medicinal uses today. This plant is also a miracle beauty saviour and does wonders to your skin. It’s loaded with antibacterial properties and can be used to tackle many beauty woes.
Health benefits of aloe vera
The anti-inflammatory properties of aloe vera help reduce the oxidative damage caused by free radicals in the body. Moreover, the antioxidants present in the gel have been proved to be useful in managing arthritis and rheumatism.
Aloe vera juice is said to be a good digestive. A cupful of the juice can help relieve stomach problems like constipation. Aloe vera causes cells to produce nitric oxide and cytokines that give the much-needed boost to your immune system.
Aloe vera is said to improve the effectiveness of your diet and maximise your weight loss potential.
Aloe vera is also majorly used in Ayurvedic preparation that is useful in correcting disorders like anaemia. It is known to increase the red blood cell count that keeps your haemoglobin levels in check.
Growing aloe vera
The first step in aloe vera plant care is to realize that this plant is a succulent. Like cacti, succulents do best in dry conditions. Plant them in a cactus potting soil mix or a regular potting soil that has been amended with additional perlite or building sand. Also, make sure that the pot has plenty of drainage holes. Aloe vera plants cannot tolerate standing water.
Make your own aloe vera gel at home
Instead of buying aloe vera gel, you can easily make it at home. All you need to do is invest in a healthy aloe vera plant. Simply cut off some leaves of the plant. Place the leaves in an upright position for a few minutes and let the dark yellow resin drain out.
Once it is drained, wash the leaves and start peeling the thick skin with a knife. To preserve the gel for a longer period, blend the gel with a few drops of Vitamin C powder, Vitamin E oil or some essential oil in a blender.
Now, pour it into a clean glass jar, which you can preserve for months in the refrigerator. Make the most of this wonder gel.
