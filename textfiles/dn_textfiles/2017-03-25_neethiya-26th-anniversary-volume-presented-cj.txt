'Neethiya' 26th Anniversary volume presented to CJ

The maiden copy of the Neethiya-26 (26th Anniversary Volume), the only journal to be published uninterrupted for 26 years in Sinhala, was presented to Chief Justice Priyasath Dep, PC in the chambers at the Supreme Court on last Thursday (23).
Commenced in 1990 as a news letter, its inaugural issue was launched by then Chief Justice Parinda Ranasinghe. It was thereafter upgrated to a fully fledged law journal with 10th anniversary issue in 2000. Due to the dirth of legal publications in Sinhala, “Neethiya” has been in great demand among the legal community, including practitioners, academics, judges, law students, law enforcement officers as well as among others interested in the law, from then up to now.
The present Volume is enriched with articles on a variety of topics on the law written by distinguished specialists, well-prepared notes on recent Court decision and statutes, legal news, tables of cases and other contents. The total costs of “Neethiya” since its inception have met solely by its patron, President’s Counsel Upali A. Goonaratne.
President’s Counsel Upali A. Goonaratne, Counsel Mahesh Wakishta, Ramitha Dissanayake, Prasad Chathuranga, and Ms Subhashini S. Jayalath were present at the occasion.
