Notts win first T20 Blast title

BIRMINGHAM, Saturday - Harry Gurney starred as Nottinghamshire held on to beat Warwickshire by 22 runs to win the English T20 Blast for the first time at Edgbaston on Saturday.
After a shaky start batting first, Samit Patel (64 not out) and Brendan Taylor (65) powered Notts to a match-winning total of 190-4. Warwickshire, playing in front of a raucous crowd at their home ground in Birmingham, also lost early wickets though, and despite a brilliant 72 from young batsman Sam Hain, ultimately fell well short. Former England international Twenty20 bowler Gurney was the hero for Nottinghamshire, as he took 4-17 from his four overs with a mix of slower balls and cutters.
Hain put on 55 with big-hitting New Zealander Colin de Grandhomme, but Gurney dismissed them both to leave the lower order with too much to do. Having also won the One-Day Cup final in July, Nottinghamshire are the first side to complete England's limited-overs double since Hampshire in 2012. Notts had been in big trouble when England seam bowler Chris Woakes reduced them to 30-3, taking the big wickets of his international team-mate Alex Hales, Riki Wessels and Tom Moores. But Zimbabwean batsman Taylor teamed up with England all-rounder Patel to compile a crucial fourth-wicket partnership of 132.
