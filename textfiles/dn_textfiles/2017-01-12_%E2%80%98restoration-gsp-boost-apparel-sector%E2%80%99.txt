‘Restoration of GSP+ boost for apparel sector’

 The European Union’s decision to restore GSP+ trade concession to Sri Lanka will boost the apparel sector and thereby open more employment avenues for Sri Lankans, the Presidential Media Division states in a press release yesterday said.
“Restoration of GSP+ will also help increase the country’s export income thus greatly benefitting the thousands of youths employed in the apparel sector by this decision,”the release said.  
The Presidential Media Division in its statement said that the EU has proposed to restore this facility to Sri Lanka after considering the reforms being implemented by the government led by President Maithripala Sirisena and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe to strengthen democracy and good governance.
“The EU has taken this decision to help the government continue these reforms in the country,”the statement said.
The statement said that President Maithripala Sirisena during his recent visit to Berlin, Germany made a request to German Chancellor Angela Merkel to help Sri Lanka secure the GSP+ trade facility again.
The German Chancellor had given an assurance to the President that she would intervene to ensure that the GSP+ facility would be restored to Sri Lanka.
“President Maithripala Sirisena during his meetings with European leaders has drawn their attention to the restoration of this facility to Sri Lanka”, the statement added.
