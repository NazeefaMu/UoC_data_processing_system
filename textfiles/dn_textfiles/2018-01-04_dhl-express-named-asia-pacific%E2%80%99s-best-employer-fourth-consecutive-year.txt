DHL Express named Asia Pacific’s  best employer for fourth consecutive year

DHL Express, the world’s leading international express services provider, has been named 2018 Top Employer for Asia Pacific as well as eight countries in the region: Australia, Hong Kong, India, Malaysia, New Zealand, the Philippines, Singapore, and Thailand.
The award was conferred by Top Employers Institute, a global organization recognizing excellence in employee conditions, making this the fourth consecutive year that DHL Express has received the award.
This further establishes the company as a regional leader in employment practices and talent development, with a workplace culture built on respect, recognition and equal opportunities.
In 2017 alone, DHL Express received a total of 49 awards for its workplace and corporate culture in Asia Pacific, up from 39 awards in 2016 and 34 awards in 2015. This year’s string of accolades are the latest additions to the 96 other awards that DHL Express Asia Pacific has received since 2014, many with strict judging criteria based on employee feedback.
“The DHL culture is built on the two R’s – respect and results. When we value our employees, and provide them with opportunities to achieve, we’re able to deliver the world-class results that our customers rely on to grow their businesses,” said Ken Lee, CEO, DHL Express Asia Pacific.
“It is an honor to be acknowledged as a leading employer and an excellent workplace in Asia Pacific once again, and a testament to the hard work and effort that all our employees invest in really making DHL Express a byword for excellence.”
The Top Employer award has consistently recognized DHL Express’ sustained investment in talent growth, including its Certified International Specialist (CIS) and Certified International Manager (CIM) programs that have trained over 43,000 employees in Asia Pacific.
Nearly 75% of executive positions in the region end up being filled by internal candidates thanks to the company’s talent development initiatives, and women hold 1 in 3 management roles in DHL Express.
“Diversity in leadership and the workplace help us better understand the full range of our customers’ needs and stories – resulting in more effective service for their businesses,” said A. Mateen, Senior Vice President, Human Resources, DHL Express Asia Pacific. “Thanks to a strong Diversity Management framework in place, coupled with comprehensive feedback from our annual Employee Opinion Survey, we’ve established a workplace culture where everyone has not only a voice, but also the opportunity to grow to their full potential.” This year, DHL Express was also named Best Employer 2017 for Asia Pacific and nine other countries region-wide, as well as 'Best Employer for Women in the Workplace' in South Korea and Taiwan, by human capital firm Aon Hewitt.
The Great Place to Work Institute also recognized DHL Express as one of the 'Best Multinational Workplaces in Asia' for five countries as well as the broader Asia Pacific region.
Dimithri Perera, Country Manager, DHL Express Sri Lanka commenting on Sri Lanka’s contribution towards this overall recognition said, “We are proud that in the year 2017, Sri Lanka was adjudged a Top 25 ‘Best Companies to Work for in Sri Lanka’ and also won the Maiden Award for ‘Best Multinational Corporation in Sri Lanka’ as well as the prestigious Gold Award for ‘Best in Medium-Sized Enterprise Category in Sri Lanka’ awarded by Great Place to Work Institute. These awards have contributed to DHL Express in Asia Pacific earning continuous recognition as one of the most inspiring and rewarding places to work where people can unlock their potential and deliver value to our clients.”
“The success of any logistics operation depends on the skill, adaptability, and resilience of its people, translated across numerous cultures and geographies,” added Ken Lee. “At DHL Express, we’re committed to creating an environment where all employees can thrive and grow. We’re extremely proud to have nearly doubled the number of awards for our culture and workplace this year compared to 2016: each award encourages us to keep working towards a more inclusive, effective, and empathetic culture in every market where we do business.”
