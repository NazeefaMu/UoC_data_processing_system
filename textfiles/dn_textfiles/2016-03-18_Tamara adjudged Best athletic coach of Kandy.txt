Tamara adjudged Best athletic coach of Kandy

 
Tamara Padmini Wickremasinghe presently with Pushpadana Girls College, Kandy, was presented with the award as the Best Athletic Coach of the Kandy Education Zone by the Chief Minister of the Central Province Sarath Ekanayake at a ceremony held at the auditorium of St. Sylvester's College.
Tamara Padmini Wickremasinghe counts over 25 years experience as an athletic coach and 24 of them being in the Kandy Education Zone. She coached Mahamaya Girls College for 21 years and before she was transferred to her present school Pushpadana Girls College, Kandy three years.
Tamara Padmini Wickremasinghe is an athlete of repute and has many records to her credit. She has one national record which can never be broken or equalled which is she is the first women athlete to run the marathon in Sri Lanka. Before this ladies running in marathons were unknown and in 1984 a a girl just out of her teens she stunned the athletic world when she ran the marathon along with men in the event organised by the Ministry of Sports. The route was along the rugged road from Torrington Square to Maharagama and back and this is something shunned by the ladies at that time.
She hails from the village of Alawwa and at school she excelled in many sports but track and field was her forte. Her winning performance at District, provincial and national level are too numerous to mention here. She also ran the marathon in Singapore, Malaysia and Japan with international though not winning she came in for a lot of recognition. Those were days the days she said that were no supplementary food, vitamins or performance enhancing exercises. We had to train all by ourselves and there was hardly anyone to tells how to start or finish and adjust ourselves while the race was in progress so that we could be in line to win.
She held the national record for 1500 metres in 1982. She also kept a record for 10 kilometres walking. Thus displaying that she could not only run but also walk faster than the others. The walking race 82.84 minutes. This was not a fun race witnessed at village new year festivals but an all island competition organised by Bata and the Ministry of Sports to decide on the Walking Champion.
After bidding adieu at the national level she moved into veterans events at International Level where she excelled in an amazing manner.
She struck gold at the veterans meets held in Singapore, Japan and Malaysia in 1500 metres, 800 metres and 3000 metres in 1996, 1997 and 1998.
She said that one of the main essentials in maintaining the winning spirit is to do regular exercises and keep fit without which your muscles get hardened and loses its power and flexibility and you limp off in pain while running.
