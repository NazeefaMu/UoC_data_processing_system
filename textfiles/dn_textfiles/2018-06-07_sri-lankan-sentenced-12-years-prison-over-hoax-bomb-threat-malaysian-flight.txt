A Sri Lankan man who falsely threatened to explode a bomb in a Malaysia Airlines flight in May, last year was sentenced to 12 years in prison by an Australian Judge today.
The flight consisted of more than 200 passengers and crew members.
The suspect identified as Manodh Marks (26)  threatened to blow up the flight, forcing the flight 128 due to arrive in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, to turn back to Melbourne, Australia.
He was sentenced to 12 years in prison after  pleading guilty.
