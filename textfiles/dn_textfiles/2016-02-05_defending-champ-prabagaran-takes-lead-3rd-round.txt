Defending champ Prabagaran takes lead in 3rd round

 
K. Prabagaran seeking his third consecutive win in the Sri Lanka Open fired a fantastic 4 under par 67, to snatch the lead from Nadaraja Thangaraja who lead the field up to the halfway mark of the Bally’s Sri Lanka Open 2015 at Royal Colombo Gplf Club yesterday.
Thangaraja maintained his lead comfortably with Prabagaran playing steadily until Thangaraja’s tee shot on the 10th rolled ‘out of bounds’ and even though he drove the green with his next shot he missed a 8 foot putt for par. Thanga encountered more trouble on the 14th to make a triple bogey and then Praba fired three Birdies to turn the tables on Thangaraja.
The Bally’s Sri Lanka Open 2015 is poised for a great finish tomorrow, with Prabgaran enjoying a slender 2 stroke lead from Thangaraja. Lalith Kumara lying in 2nd place after two rounds had a disastrous start and even though he pulled back with three Birdies he dropped three shots again in the 17th and 18th. M. Dharma a seasoned Indian Pro on the Professional Golf Tour of India (PGTI) is in 3rd place 7 shots off the leader.
Praba returned the only sub-par card today considered a tough day in the office by all Professional who played today.
The Bally’s Sri Lanka Open 2015 carries a handsome Prize Purse encouraging top players to participate and the support of the title sponsor Bally’s Entertainment, Co-Sponsor UTE CAT, the Affiliate Sponsors NISSAN X Trail and CML Walkers has given the opportunity for Professionals from India, Pakistan and Australia to have played this year.
