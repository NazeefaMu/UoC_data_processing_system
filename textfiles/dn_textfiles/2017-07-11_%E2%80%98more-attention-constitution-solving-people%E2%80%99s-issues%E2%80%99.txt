‘More attention on Constitution than solving people’s issues’

The Government makes arrangements to reform the Constitution instead of paying attention to the problems of the general public, Democratic Left Front General Secretary Vasudewa Nanayakkara said.
Speaking at a media briefing at the N. M. Perera Centre in Borella yesterday, he said they want a leader who would be liable to Parliament and the Executive Presidency should be abolished after the next election.
The Secretary said the general public requires an uninterrupted supply of essential goods, concessionary facilities and a fair price for the products but not a constitutional reform.
He said the Constitution would be reformed to satisfy the needs of the foreign nations and it would be adversely affected to the unity of the country.
“Megapolis and Western Development Minister Patali Champika Ranawaka says he is in opposition with the establishment of the South Asian Institute of Technology and Medicine (SAITM) and an insurrection will be created if no immediate actions will be taken against the SAITM issue,”Nanayakkara said.
The Secretary said the reason behind the instability of the pepper prices in Ratnapura was due to a cheap stock of imported pepper. The pepper had been mixed with Sri Lankan pepper and they would be exported.
“It is backed up by a powerful political force, and it will harm the goodwill of the country,” he said.
