CID seeks AG’s advice on D.V. Upul

Threatening FCID:
The CID conducting investigations against UPFA Southern Provincial Council Minister D.V. Upul for allegedly making threatening remarks over Financial Crimes Investigation Division (FCID), has sought Attorney General’s advice regarding the future legal action against the suspect.
When the case pertaining to the matter came up before Chief Magistrate Lal Ranasinghe Bandara, the CID informed Court that they have concluded investigations into the incident and investigation notes have been forwarded to the Attorney General for his advice.
Addressing a public gathering on May 31, 2015, D.V. Upul had allegedly threatened to stone to death the officers attached to the FCID once Mahinda Rajapaksa returned to power as the Prime Minister in the country.
The CID had launched an investigation into the statement by Provincial Council Minister.
The Provincial Council Minister made this remark in the presence of UPFA Parliamentarian Namal Rajapaksa and several other local politicians representing the Hambantota district.
“Collect the name-list of FCID officers from police constable to the DIG. They should be stoned to death when Mahinda Rajapaksa becomes Prime Minister of this country. We are waiting till that day arrives. If someone in the government opposes that, we will take to the streets against the government,” Upul had told the gathering.
