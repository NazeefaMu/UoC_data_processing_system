Evidence insufficient to arrest Namal Kumara - Police

CID investigations into the alleged assassination attempt of the President have revealed that there wasn’t sufficient evidence to arrest the informant Namal Kumara.
Police spokesperson SP Ruwan Gunasekera speaking at a special media briefing said that 89 statements on the former DIG of the Terrorist Investigation Division Nalaka de Silva was recorded, out of which 47 were from fellow Police officers.
According to the Police Media Spokesman, audio recordings have been handed over to the CID by Namal Kumara, but there had been no evidence to link any of the recordings with the assassination of the President or prominent Members of Parliament.
It was revealed that the statements were recorded from the witnesses for 41 days by the CID. The progress report on these findings was presented to the Fort Magistrate’s Courts on September 17.
He also revealed that the arrest of the former TID DIG Nalaka de Silva, wasn’t based purely on voice recordings, but on many other factors relating to the investigation as well.
“The Police is ready to arrest any individual regardless of his ranks or position if he is found to be guilty of any crimes,” he said.
The former DIG was interrogated by the CID for five days while six voice clips related to the alleged assassination plot,were sent to the Government Analyst, the report of which will be received in the near future.
The Government Analyst found that out of 124 voice clips, 123 tallied with the voice of the former DIG.
He also said that the laptop and mobile phone belonging to the former DIG was sent to the Government Analyst for investigations.
The DIG has been remanded till November 7 after being produced before the Fort Magistrate last Thursday.
It was revealed that the DIG was taken into custody over allegations relating to an assassination attempt of an Assistant Superintendent of Police Prasanna Alwis who is attached to the Colombo Crimes Investigation Division.
The Police Media Spokesman also highlighted the fact that crucial evidence has being obtained in connection to the assassination attempt on the Assistant Superintendent of Police of the CCID.
