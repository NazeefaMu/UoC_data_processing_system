Sri Lanka Technological Campus registration begins for Engineering Students

Completing its second successful year since launching in 2014, the Sri Lanka Technological Campus (SLTC) has opened registrations for new applicants for its September 2017 intake creating opportunities for talented Sri Lankan students to obtain a world’s best Engineering degrees at an affordable price.
The September 2017 intake is for students who wish to pursue a reputed Engineering qualification from world-renowned colleges like Lancaster University, UK and Deakin University, Australia. These colleges offer the 2+2 undergraduate degree programme in the field of Mechatronic and Electronic Engineering leading to a degree awarded by those universities respectively.
The 2+2 degree programme partnership means that the first two years of the programme would be taught at SLTC, Sri Lanka and the final two years at Lancaster University, UK or Deakin University, Australia. “This is the only opportunity for someone in Sri Lanka to read for an Engineering degree from one of the world’s top 1% in university rankings while studying in the country,” said President SLTC, Eng. Ranjith Rubasinghe. “We believe that every student must have the opportunity to pursue their dreams and to be able to afford and access great opportunities.”
Under the guidance of the Ministry of Telecommunication and Digital Infrastructure, the SLTC was launched with the motive of realizing Sri Lanka’s vision of becoming the knowledge hub in Asia. Fully owned by Sri Lanka Telecom, the campus offers a full four-year degree programme for students, designed to provide sound theoretical, practical and analytical knowledge with the fundamentals of engineering and technology. SLTC’s Engineering degree programmes are accredited by the Ministry of Higher Education and Highways and recognized by the University Grants Commission (UGC) of Sri Lanka.
An impressive faculty comprising industry experts and lecturers who have taken on the onus of providing a sound and knowledgeable education conducts SLTC degree programmes.
Studying at SLTC also means affordability and effectiveness. Students are supported through financial aid, low interest student loans, housing and accommodation, and numerous other benefits offered at this residential campus.
The entry qualification for the degree programme is in line with the Sri Lanka Qualification Framework which includes minimum three passes at the GCE A/L Examination in one and the same sitting in the physical science stream including Combined Mathematics, Chemistry and Physics. Students with the equivalent London A/L results and those with pending A/L results are also encouraged and eligible to apply. 
As Sri Lanka’s only corporate powered, fully residential and research based campus, students at SLTC learn to integrate, study, learn and live together in cohesiveness and camaraderie. Apart from classroom study, students are also groomed to become productive citizens with personal and professional integrity by demonstrating leadership, effective decision-making and to hold the highest ethical standards.
