Daughter demands Rs.75,000 from mother to handover father’s body

A shocking story of a daughter allegedly demanding Rs. 75,000 from her mother to handover the body of her father who died recently is reported from Warawewa, Giribawa.
The father who died was a resident of Bentara. The daughter who is married and settled down in Girbawa had visited her parents in Bentara with her husband. Her father had fallen ill and was hospitalised. When the father was discharged from hospital the daughter had taken the father under her care and taken him to her residence in Warawewa since his health was deteriorating.
However, the father had died on May 20 and the daughter had arranged his funeral at Warawewa without informing her mother or relatives.
The mother who came to know about her husband’s death had made a bee-line to the daughter’s house in Warawewa hoping to stage the funeral at their home town of Bentara. When the mother arrived at the daughter’s house, she had found out that her husband’s funeral arrangements, including the Pansakula ceremony had been finalised by the daughter at Warawewa.
When the mother demanded that the body be taken to Bentara, the daughter had demanded Rs.75,000 from her saying she had already spent the money on the funeral arrangements after receiving it as a donation from the death donation society in the area. However, the relatives who accompanied the mother had complained to the Giribawa Police about the tussle between the daughter and mother. Police soon arrived at the daughter’s house and took steps to handover the body to the legal wife without any payment to the daughter. During the Police inquiry the daughter had accused her mother and relatives in Bentara of neglecting her father during his lifetime and were now demanding his body with an eye on his pension.
