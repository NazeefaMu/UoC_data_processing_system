‘Sure defeat of No Confidence Motion’

The No-Confidence Motion against Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe tabled in Parliament is aimed to prevent legal action from being taken against people who engaged in fraud and corruption, and killings during the previous regime, UNP Deputy General Secretary Minister Akila Viraj Kariyawaram said.
“The Joint opposition is trying to cover its sins through the No-Confidence Motion.”
The minister who emphasised that no member of the UNP would support the motion, added that he never believed that the UNP had any members with insane minds as to support a motion of this nature. He said the No-Confidence Motion would face sure defeat if it was taken up for debate.
