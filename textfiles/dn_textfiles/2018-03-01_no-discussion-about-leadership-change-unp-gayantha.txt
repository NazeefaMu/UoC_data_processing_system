No discussion about leadership change in UNP - Gayantha

Discussions are underway within the United National Party with regard to reforms in the party, but not about a party leadership change, Co-Cabinet Spokesman Lands and Parliamentary Reforms Minister Gayantha Karunathilaka said.
He was responding to a question from a journalist at the weekly Cabinet media briefing held yesterday, at the Government Information Department.
“After understanding the message given by people through the local government election results, we decided that the UNP should go for reforms.”
Responding to a question with regard to the suggestion by some UNP MPs to bring a no confidence motion against the Prime Minister,
Minister Karunathilaka said that having such conflicts within the party is natural and the UNP has experienced such incidents several times before.
