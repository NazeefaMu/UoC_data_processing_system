Delegation to promote investment and exports  in Germany

An investment delegation led by Malik Samarawickrama Minister of Development Strategies and International Trade will make a strong pitch this week for German investment to Sri Lanka.
The delegation will visit Frankfurt, Hamburg and Berlin and meet with senior German officials, as well as captains of German industry. The Sri Lankan delegation will comprise Senior officials involved in vital aspects of the economy including Mr. Mangala Yapa, Board Member of the Board of Investment of Sri Lanka (BOI), Mr. Duminda Ariyasinghe, Director General of the BOI, Mrs. Indira Malwatte, Chairperson/ Chief Executive of the Export Development Board as well as other senior officials of the Ministry of Development Strategies and International Trade. This delegation will also include representatives from leading Sri Lankan Companies which have an interest in Germany, as well as officials from the German Chamber of Industry and Commerce (AHK).
Germany is of considerable importance to Sri Lanka as it is the largest economy within the European Union and also a dynamo in the manufacturing sector which is a focus sector for Sri Lanka. In addition, Germany is also a leader in the field of logistics notably in Hamburg and software knowledge services including state of the art incubator services which are centered in Berlin.
This highly targeted mission will include investment forums where top German and Sri Lankan companies can share experiences, and presentations by the BOI and the EDB will be conducted. The Private sector delegates will consist of Ranjith Pandithage, Chairman Diesel and Motor Engineering PLC (DIMO), Shiraz Immarudeen, Head Strategic Planning and Business Development, Expolanka Holdings PLC, Sameera Nilupul, Director/Chief Technical Officer (CTO), Live Room (Pvt) Ltd, Shirendra Lawrence, Chief Operating Officer, MAS Holdings (Pvt) Ltd. Dr. Toru Takehara, Chairman, Colombo Dockyard PLC, Liang Thow Ming, Chief Sales and Marketing Officer of CHEC Port City Colombo Pvt Ltd and Thulci Aluwihare, head of Strategy and Business Development CHEC Port City.
German companies that have invested in Sri Lanka in the past include Kramski, a high tech engineering company which celebrated 25 years in the country. Kramski produces components for many German and International Brand names including Blum, Bosch, Delphi, Roche and Sumida.
Germany has taken a strategic interest in investing Sri Lanka as the Government policy actively encourages private sector led growth. This is reflected by the decision of AHK to open a full time office in Colombo in March 2018 in support of expanding investment and trade from Germany to Sri Lanka.
The forums are to be held in the Chambers of Commerce in Frankfurt, Hamburg and Berlin.
