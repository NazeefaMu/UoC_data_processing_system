The culinary magic of Vietnam at Hilton Colombo!

The culinary magic of Vietnam can be experienced at the GRAZE KITCHEN from June 29 to July 15 during dinner from 7pm to 10.30pm. Two amazing guest chefs from Hilton Hanoi Opera will transport you to exotic Vietnam with authentic dishes freshly prepared at the dedicated action pod.
“Diners can enjoy a selection of appetizers, mains and desserts which will rotate daily,” said Executive Chef Kazi in a press release and ads that the menu has been carefully curated to give every foodie an experience of exotic tastes. From the many exciting preparations, something to look forward to is the traditional “Pho” station with condiments!
