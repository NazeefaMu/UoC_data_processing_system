SLCS to conduct breast cancer seminar

A three-hour education session to create awareness among the general public, especially amongst females; on the rise of breast cancer in Sri Lanka, will be conducted by the Sri Lanka Cancer Society (SLCS) at a special seminar scheduled to be held at the SLCS auditorium, Buller's Lane, Colombo 7, on November 7 at 9.00am.
Sri Lanka’s eminent cancer specialists attached to the Sri Lanka National Cancer Control Programme (NCCP) will address the seminar, which will be organized by the SLCS Public Education Division under the supervision of SLCS Public Education Committee Chairperson Indrani Nanayakkara.
The seminar will be followed by a session of questions and answers for the benefit of participants to know more about the early detention of breast cancer, breast cancer symptoms, risk factors and treatments.
According to breast cancer specialists, the cancer starts when cells in the breast begin to grow out of control. These cells usually form a tumor that can often be seen on an x-ray or felt as a lump. The tumor is malignant (cancerous) if the cells can grow into (invade) surrounding tissues or spread (metastasize) to distant areas of the body.
Speaking at a media briefing, Chairperson Nanayakkara highlighted the importance of conducting such a seminar and said this nature of seminars will largely benefit the said vulnerable sector. Quoting research, she said, "Out of all cancer patients, around 28 percent of femalesin our country suffer from breast cancer and it is pathetic to say that incidents of breast cancer are gradually on the rise."
Speaking further, Chairperson Nanayakkara said breast cancer is the most prevalent cancer among women in the world. About 1 percent of men too are prone to it and according to World Health Organization (WHO), one out of every eight women in the world develop breast cancer.
She said breast cancer is common in women over 35 years of age, never breastfeeding a child is also a risk factor and the risk is greater as a woman gets older.
She said the main objective of conducting this seminar is to educate the participants about the signs and symptoms of breast cancer, the risk factors, how to self-examine breasts, which is very important in early detection and treatment that could lead to cure.
She also reminded the public that the Cancer Society conducts a poly-clinic every second Sunday of the month for screening for breast, cervical and mouth cancers, free of charge.
SLCS Public Education Officer D. W. S. Jayaratne said the Society also conducts awareness seminars in schools and in public offices. He advises the general public and those who wish to get screening done free-of-charge, to come to the Sri Lanka Cancer Society; 37/25, Buller's Lane, Colombo 7.
