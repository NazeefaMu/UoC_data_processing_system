China to gift nephrology hospital to Polonnaruwa

President Maithripala Sirisena would lay the foundation for the construction of a national nephrology hospital, which is a gift from China, on December 6, at 9.45 a.m. The project cost is estimated to be Rs. 12 billion.
Chinese Ambassador to Sri Lanka Yi Xianliang and Health Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne would be present at the ceremony. The nephrology-specialized hospital is planned to house 200 patient beds and 100 dialysis beds.
The construction site is located in the east of the Polonnaruwa ancient city, adjacent to the Batticaloa road to the north, 600 metres away from the Polonnaruwa General Hospital.
With a construction land area of about 6.63 hectares and a gross floor area of nearly 25,210 square metres, the multi-storeyed building would contain diagnostics and medical-imaging facilities and a moderate amount of staff dormitories, while the building density and greening rate of the project land are planned to be 21 percent and 35 percent, respectively.
The design scheme of the hospital has been striven to build a green, ecological hospital through provision of an atrium and exterior courtyard, reducing poor lighting, lessening use of lighting and ventilation equipment, and decreasing AC operation.
The hospital project includes six construction contents such as outpatient, medical technology, inpatient, administration, security system, and hospital life. The medical technology unit includes a digital x-ray machine, CT machine, colour Doppler ultrasound, BW ultra sound, ECG, two kidney transplant operating theaters, surgical ICU, etc. The construction work of the project is planned to be completed within two years.
