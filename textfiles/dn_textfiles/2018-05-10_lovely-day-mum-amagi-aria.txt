A lovely day with Mum at Amagi Aria

 
 
 
 
 
This Mother’s Day, Amagi Aria invites you to treat your mum to a relaxing day out, with a big splash of enjoyment and love from her favourite people. A relaxing day, laughter and precious time with her family – what more can our dear mums ask for?
A day out at Amagi Aria is a simple yet great way to show your mum how much she means to you – although our love for her cannot be limited to a day, she will certainly appreciate the little things that matter the most.
The Amagi Aria Mother’s Day special day out package includes a welcome drink, an expansive lunch buffet, a mocktail or a glass of vino during lunch, afternoon tea or coffee with a cup cake in the evening, free use of the pool and a complimentary room for a group of 10 or more.
As a tribute to all the good things our mums’ have done for us and for the sacrifices made for us, Amagi Aria extends a special appreciation to all mums with a fabulous MUM DINES FOR FREE offer; so that all you need to worry about is spending some quality time with mummy dearest – one that she truly deserves! (valid for every group of three people)
The Amagi Aria Mother’s Day Out package is available on Sunday, May 13 from 9am to 5pm.
