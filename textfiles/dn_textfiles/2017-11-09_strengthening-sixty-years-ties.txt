The Chinese Vice Minister stated that the Chinese people would never forget that when China was blockaded by the West, it was Sri Lanka that gave valuable support to China despite tremendous pressure.
He also stated that under the guidance of President Xi Jinping, China would wish to work hand in hand with Sri Lanka in the spirit of sincere mutual assistance and ever-lasting friendship, to create an even better future for China - Sri Lanka relationship.
