Grand Christmas celebrations

The Sri Lankan Embassy of Jordan in Amman celebrated Christmas day on December 23. This event, symbolizing harmony, joy and peace was organized by the embassy with the fullest support of the staff and over 200 Sri Lankans representing different faiths took part. The event was held at the embassy premises.
The central event of the celebration was the Holy Mass conducted by Rev. Fr. Niroshan Srikantha who also offered a blessing on all Sri Lankans. This was followed by elegant dances and carols performed by children from the Sri Lankan community. Reenactment of the Nativity scene of Bethlehem was also performed. Surprising everyone at the event Santa Clause made a sudden appearance and gave out Christmas presents to children.
Addressing a diverse gathering of Sri Lankans living in Jordan, Ambassador A.L.M Lafeer, elaborated on the process of reconciliation and harmony and asked all those who were present to contribute to this process. The Ambassador further noted the importance of being virtuous and true to oneself, despite undue influence created by the contemporary society and media.
A sumptuous luncheon was hosted at the end of the gathering which was open to everyone who took part.
