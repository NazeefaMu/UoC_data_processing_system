New uniform for midwives

Health Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne has issued a gazette notification on the new uniform for midwives (family health workers), a Health Ministry spokesman said.
According to the spokesman, Minister Senaratne had handed over a copy of the notification to the Midwives Association President Devika Kodithuwakku at the International Day of the Midwife celebrations held at Royal Collage, Polonnaruwa, recently. Minister Senaratne stated that motorcycles had been provided for midwives to carry out their duties swiftly, but some midwives had not received them so far.
A Cabinet paper will be presented soon in order to provide them with motorcycles, he added.
