Protect yourself while travelling abroad!

Dr. Palitha Mahipala speaks about the diseases people should be vigilant of before and after trevelling overseas. A large number of
Sri Lankans travel to various countries for various purposes and they need to take care of their health and the health of their loved ones.
Q - A large number of Sri Lankans are traveling abroad for various purposes. Mainly what are the diseases one should be vigilant of while travelling?
A - International traveling has been considered as one of the main ways of spreading diseases across the countries. This is common to Sri Lanka too. Basically two kinds of diseases spread (1) Existing diseases such as Malaria, Yellow Fever etc (2) Emerging diseases such as Merse Corona Virus, Ebola etc
Dr. Palitha Mahipala
From time to time, depending on the situation, WHO informs its member countries about precautions to be taken. With regard to Sri Lanka, Malaria and Yellow Fever situattions are important as Malaria is eliminated and Yellow Fever is not reported in Sri Lanka for many decades.
Therefore people traveling to countries where Yellow Fever is endemic, vaccination is mandatory. Yellow Fever is endemic in African and South American countries predominantly.
For Malaria, prophylaxis treatment as well as reporting to health authorities if fever developed after returning are very important. Malaria is endemic in African countries and Asian countries. These measures are being taken to prevent international spread of disease and to protect individual travelers who may be exposed to such diseases.
On the other hand, diseases such as Zika Virus and it's complications like Microcephaly, Guillain Bare Syndrome pose a new type of public health threat with long term consequences for families, communities and countries. So traveling to those countries during pregnancy needs to be avoided.
Q - What should be done before traveling to such a countries ?
A - As already explained, vaccination and prophylaxis chemotherapy are required and avoid unnecessary traveling as much as possible.
Q - What should be done after returning from an affected country ?
A - The general public, specially travelers need to be informed about these public health issues and should be enlightened on what to do after returning to the country.
If symptoms develop, go to health authorities to seek care and report about travel history.
Q - What should be done if family members travel with us to an affected country ?
A - Better avoid or refrain from traveling when there is an international spread of an emerging disease. Diseases like malaria and yellow fever require prophylaxis treatment and vaccinations.
O<U+200B>nce <U+200B>people return to the country from abroad, if symptoms like fever with cough, sore throat, etc develop they should report to the closest MOH (Medical Officer of Health or PHI (Public Health Inspector) and seek treatment based on the countries visited at least within two weeks of returning.
This is a must for protecting the health of the traveler, his/her loved ones and entire society.
