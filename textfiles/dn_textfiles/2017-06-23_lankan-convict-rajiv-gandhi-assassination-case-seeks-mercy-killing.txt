Lankan convict in Rajiv Gandhi assassination case seeks mercy killing

One of the convicts in the Rajiv Gandhi assassination case, Robert Payas, a Sri Lankan national, on Wednesday petitioned the Tamil Nadu government seeking mercy killing.
In an emotionally charged letter to Chief Minister K Palaniswami, he said he should be killed on grounds of mercy and his body should be handed over to his family.
"Payas has petitioned the government through the Puzhal prison authorities," a top prison official said.
Blaming the Centre -- both the previous United Progressive Alliance government and the incumbent National Democratic Alliance -- for opposing the release of seven Rajiv Gandhi case convicts, including him, when former Chief Minister Jayalalithaa took the initiative, he said, "We do not know why our release has been put on hold." - Agencies
