Former England Chelsea star Lampard retires

LONDON, Thursday: Former England and Chelsea midfield star Frank Lampard retired on Thursday aged 38, calling time on a playing career that will be remembered as one of the Premier League's finest.
Lampard did not reveal what he plans to do next, but said he was grateful to the Football Association for the opportunity to do his coaching badges, suggesting he may go into management.
Chelsea's record goalscorer said he had turned down "a number of exciting offers" to carry on playing in Britain and abroad.
"After 21 incredible years I have decided that now is the right time to finish my career as a professional footballer," Lampard wrote on Facebook.
"I'm immensely proud of the trophies I've won, of representing my country over 100 times and of scoring more than 300 career goals."
Lampard left New York City FC in the autumn and also played for West Ham United and Manchester City in the Premier League.
But it was at Stamford Bridge where he really made his name as a prolific midfielder.
He scored 211 times for the Blues and won every major club honour, netting the goals which in 2005 secured the club's first championship title in 50 years. "Of course, the largest part of my heart belongs to Chelsea Football Club, a club which has given me so many great memories," Lampard wrote. - AFP
