AN EVENING OF REVERENCE AT JETWING

In an effort to pay homage to their senior most associates at Jetwing Hotels on dedicating 25 years of service or more to the Jetwing family, an evening of Reverence took place recently at Jetwing Blue with over 80 associates receiving awards of service.
This evening was attended not only by those who have completed 25 years of service and more and are still continuing their service but those who have concluded their long years of dedication to the Jetwing family as well but are still with them as well-wishers.
Their stories of success have undoubtedly contributed to the Jetwing story of triumph. A true inspiration to the young ones within the Jetwing family, Hyacinth Gunawardena joined the Blue Oceanic Blue Hotel (now Jetwing Blue) as a trainee receptionist under the guidance of late Herbert Cooray.
Her thought process of work as a passion than a profession drove her to achieve only the highest of acclaims within the hospitality industry as she presently is the Director General Manager for both Jetwing Blue and Jetwing Beach. Jayasena Bandara who incidentally is the only associate to work under three generations of the Cooray family and who is as old as Jetwing Hotels, has watched many hotels build its way up to the Jetwing chain of hotels and has been a loyal supporter of the Cooray family in building the Jetwing family. In the same light, Ruan Samarasinghe –Jetwing Hotels, Managing Director has been a pillar of strength holding the Jetwing family together since its inception with the late Herbert Cooray. Being the most senior associate in the Jetwing Family he has been a true inspiration to all over the years.
As such 82 stories of undeterred dedication and passion were recognized this evening by Jetwing, Chairman, Hiran Cooray. Jetwing Hotels, Managing Director, Ruan Samarasinghe and Jetwing Travels, Managing Director, Shiromal Cooray along with late chairman’s wife Josephine Cooray.
Speaking at the event Jetwing, Chairman, Hiran Cooray said, “We are blessed to have been in the industry for long years and even more so be a leader in tourism from such humble beginnings. There is no doubt that the legendary service that Jetwing is known for is the hard work and passion put in by all of our associates. Today we celebrate some of the greatest individuals I know, and those who I am privileged to call my colleagues and friends.
I thank all of you for being the strength to my father at the inception and now standing by me as we continue to carry on the legacy of the Jetwing family.”
