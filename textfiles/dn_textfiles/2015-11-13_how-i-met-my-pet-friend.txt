How I met my pet friend

Meet Rose and Iraki Kodithuwakku. Their friendship goes back for two years. This is their story :).
Q: How did you meet your friend?
A: I met her while returning home after boarding a rescue, an injured stray dog at the vets. She was playing all alone with her own shadow. It was definitely love at first sight. As soon as I saw her I just knew she was the dog for me. She was around 2 months when I rescued her.
Q: How did you come up with the names?
A: Named her "Rose" first but she became "Natta" as she never gains weight no matter how much she eats!
Q: Who does she love the most?
A: She loves me the most!
Q: What does she love to do the most?
A: She enjoys playing with me and the other pets I have at home.
She enjoys going out of the gate whenever she gets the chance to creep out!
Q: How does she react when you leave home and return home?
A: She looks withered whenever we go out of the house but dances around with joy whenever we come back!
Q: What is your best memory of Rose?
A: Even though I often described her as picky about other dogs, she shared her home with dozens over the years.
She saw me through some of the most difficult times of my life and yet she made me feel like I would happily do it all again, as she is at my side. Each and every day with her is a best memory.
