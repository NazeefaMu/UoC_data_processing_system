In close rapport with reconciliation

The National Unity Government, formed in the year 2015, has already taken many progressive steps within the course of last two years for alleviating the hardships of the war affected Tamil community in the North and East of Sri Lanka. Restoration of democratic governance is one important dimension of the reconciliation process. In this direction, several important legislative enactments have been made by Parliament. Out of them, passing the 19th Amendment of the Constitution which provided for the appointment of independent Commissions is a very important step taken by the government. By a resolution, Parliament has constituted itself as a Constituent Assembly and also as a Steering Committee comprising of representatives of all political parties in Parliament.
The Constituent Assembly and the Steering Committee were empowered to deliberate and draft a Constitution. The Constituent Assembly has already received the reports of the six sub-committees who dealt with different aspects of the constitutional reforms. The Public Representations Committee also has submitted its report.
The National Unity Government is an alliance of the two main political parties in the country, the UNP and the SLFP. The joining of these two political parties to form a government is a power sharing arrangement between the two main political parties, marking a very significant and positive change in the political culture of this country. The main feature of the political culture of this country has been the perennial struggle or competition between these two political parties for capturing and retaining political power representing themselves as two rival parties.
National Unity Government
The forming of the National Unity Government marked the end of a state of rivalry between these two political parties whose power base was the Sinhalese community in the South. The objective of the alliance of the two main political parties was to form a strong government for achieving the objective of accelerated economic development and achieving reconciliation among the ethnic communities and permanent peace.
The government has made commendable progress in implementing the measures undertaken by co-sponsoring the UNHRC Resolution No.30/1 in October 2015 and a further period of two years has been granted for completing the tasks undertaken by the Sri Lankan government. This resolution deals with the issues such as the Transitional Justice Process, missing persons, detainees in prisons and constitutional reforms.
When we consider the highly controversial and sensitive nature of the issues that the government has undertaken to deal with, there will certainly be all sorts of obstructions preventing the speedy attention to such issues. For example, legislation is now in place for the establishment of the Office of Missing Persons authorized to ascertain what happened to the missing persons. But the victims of disappearances and their families are still impatiently waiting for the implementation of the law.
The role played by extremist nationalist political parties and civil society organisations in politics of Sri Lanka is the most significant factor that has contributed to the slow progress of the reconciliation process. In this article I attempt to discuss the obstructionist role played by such ‘spoilers’.
The main Tamil political alliance in Parliament, the Tamil National Alliance under the leadership of R. Sampanthan representing the majority of the Tamils in the North and East has expressed its willingness to extend all possible support to the government for going ahead with the constitution making process aimed at bringing about a political solution ‘within the framework of a single undivided and indivisible Sri Lanka’. Sampanthan has very clearly stated that what the Tamil community needs is to live as equal citizens in dignity with other communities enjoying the same political, economic, social and cultural rights.
The Tamil National Alliance cooperating with the Sri Lankan government in formulating constitutional proposals is a very desirable and positive development. However, it is very unfortunate that there is a formidable section of parliamentarians who oppose all steps and initiatives taken by the government for achieving reconciliation and a durable political settlement. Most of them are a section of MPs from the SLFP who preferred to remain in the Opposition.
Constitutional reforms
This anti-government political formation led by the former President Mahinda Rajapaksa is strictly opposed to the policy of cooperating with the UNP. They cannot just tolerate a section of the SLFP led by President Maithripala Sirisena working together with the UNP under a power-sharing arrangement. This ideological position of a section of the Opposition in Parliament poses a serious threat to achieving the goal of formulating a constitution acceptable to all communities in Sri Lanka. For amending or changing some provisions of the present Constitution, not only the approval of a two-third majority in Parliament but also the approval by a majority of voters at a referendum is necessary.
The anti-government Opposition led by the former President has engaged in a propaganda campaign against the government led by the President and the Prime Minister projecting the national reconciliation process and the proposed constitutional reforms as an anti-national project which poses a very serious threat to the sovereignty of the state and the national security.
The propaganda campaign of the anti-government Opposition is seeking to create an impression in the mind of the Sinhalese people that the present government has agreed with the Tamil leaders to grant a federal constitution, which means according to them, a separate government for the Tamils in the North and East. The anti-government faction of the SLFP is supported by some extremist Sinhala nationalist parties such as Mahajana Eksath Peramuna (MEP), National Freedom Front (NFF) and Pivithuru Hela Urumaya (PHU). They represent themselves as the Joint Opposition within Parliament and have adopted an obstructionist attitude towards the government.
There are also some retired military officers who support the Joint Opposition propaganda campaign which is a very unfortunate development. Some steps that the present government has decided to take in response to the Resolution No. 30/1 of the UNHRC in Geneva, such as the returning of private land occupied by the armed forces to the owners, investigation of cases of disappearances during the course of the war or replacement of the Prevention of Terrorism Act (PTA) by another law conforming to the required international standards for the protection of human rights of persons in the custody of law enforcement authorities, are viewed by them as a very serious threat to the security of the nation. There is a strong resistance to the undertaking given by the Sri Lankan government to hold a credible investigation of allegations of serious violations of human rights amounting to war crimes and humanitarian law during the last stage of the Eelam War IV.
The nationalist extremists go to the extent of arguing that the delegates of the Sri Lankan government who represented Sri Lanka at the sessions of the UNHRC in Geneva should have objected to the adoption of any resolutions against Sri Lanka and adopted a confrontationist approach to the UNO interventions in the Sri Lankan affairs. But, the critics of the government policy have forgotten that the resolution No. 30/1 co-sponsored by Sri Lanka is not only an undertaking given to the UNHRC but it is also an undertaking given by the government to address some burning issues of a section of the Sri Lankan citizens affected by the war.
There are also some organisations of Buddhist priests such as Pavidi Handa and Bodu Bala Sena who are opposed to the holding of any investigations against the Sri Lankan armed forces.
It is perhaps, after considering the adverse effect of the serious objections expressed by the Joint Opposition to the implementation of the relevant provision in the Resolution No. 30/1 of the UNHRC, may have in shaping the opinion of the Sinhalese electorate that the Prime Minister and the President made statements recently to the effect that both of them are opposed to the establishment of hybrid courts for investigating allegations of war crimes and violations of humanitarian law.
There is another obstructionist voice emanating from the Tamil community refusing to accept the guidance and leadership of moderate Tamil leaders in the TNA.
Some Tamil extremist nationalists in the North and some Tamil diaspora organisations that support them have adopted an anti-government attitude similar to the attitude of the Joint Opposition of Sinhalese extremists. Some newspapers reported recently that there was a call by two former members of Parliament for the Jaffna District, V. Ananda Sangaree of TULF and Suresh Premachandra of EPRLF for TNA and Opposition leader R. Sampanthan to resign as leader of Opposition.
An impartial observer of the history of the ethnic conflict in Sri Lanka would find that the main reason for the failure of the peace talks at different stages of the development of the conflict was the inability of the leaders of the two communities to deviate from the extremist nationalist ideologies by which they were guided and reach a compromise regarding a pragmatic political settlement taking into consideration the ground realities.
But, it is the hope of all moderate thinkers such as R. Sampanthan had stated in the course of his speech at a conference held in New Delhi recently that another opportunity is now available for the framing of a Constitution based upon a substantial and reasonable consensus amongst political parties and peoples in the country.
