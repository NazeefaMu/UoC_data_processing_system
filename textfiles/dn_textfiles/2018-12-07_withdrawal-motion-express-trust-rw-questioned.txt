Withdrawal of motion to express trust in RW questioned

Parliamentarian Mahinda Yapa Abeywardena yesterday questioned the withdrawal of UNP parliamentarian Mayantha Dissanayake’s proposal expressing confidence in UNP leader Ranil Wickremesinghe in Parliament on Wednesday
He was addressing a press conference in Battaramulla yesterday.
He said a group of UNP MPs were to vote against Wickremesinghe if it was taken up for debate.
“The UNP knows that Wickremesinghe cannot obtain at least 15 votes though it boasts of having the support of 122 members in Parliament,” he said
The proposal by UNP MP Mayantha Dissanayake expressing confidence in former Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe was included in the agenda of Parliament on Wednesday.
He said parliamentarian Mayantha Dissanayake withdrew the proposal as a group of MPs in the party was to vote against Wickremesinghe.
Abeywardena said the Wednesday’s proceedings were conducted without a proper agenda.
