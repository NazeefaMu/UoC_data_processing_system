NCPA programme on ill effects of harsh punishment

National Child Protection Authority (NCPA) plans to launch a programme to educate school principals and teachers countrywide on the negative effects of punishing students physically and mentally, Chairperson Marini de Livera said yesterday.
The NCPA plans to educate about 5,600 school principals and 23,000 school teachers at the first stage of this programme, during this year.
Many incidents of harassment and abuse of children at orphanages too have been reported in the recent past.
School principals and teachers of both local and international schools are to be included in the programme.
Harsh punishment of school students has been prohibited by the Education Ministry’s circular No.2016/12 April 29, 2016, de Livera said.
