Ogilvy PR Sri Lanka wins top Asia Pacific award for 'Right to Information' campaign

Ogilvy Public Relations Sri Lanka succeeded in finishing ahead of 1,200 of the best award entries from across the Asia Pacific region at the SABRE APAC Awards held in Hong Kong recently.
The agency’s ‘Uncover the Truth’ campaign for Sri Lanka’s Right to Information Act won two Certificates of Excellence, a Gold Award in the ‘Charities and Not-For-Profit’ category and the Best-in-Show’ campaign at the SABRE APAC Awards 2017. Ogilvy Public Relations Sri Lanka is the first and only PR Agency in the country to win the Platinum ‘Best-in-Show’ Award, earning it the crown of the best PR campaign in the Asia Pacific awards show, which saw entries from Australia, Japan, India, China, Singapore, Hong Kong, Indonesia, and many others in the region.
The SABRE Awards Show is the world’s largest and most sought after public relations awards competition, which recognises superior achievement in Branding and Reputation Management in North America, Latin America, Europe, Middle East and Africa (EMEA), South Asia and the Asia-Pacific regions.
The SABRE Awards is hosted by The Holmes Report, the authoritative voice of the global public relations industry, dedicated to proving and improving the value of public relations by providing insights, knowledge and recognition to public relations professionals.
This campaign for Transparency International Sri Lanka (TISL) focused on educating the Sri Lankan public on the Right to Information (RTI) Act, which came into effect on February 4, 2017, after nearly two decades awaiting parliamentary sign-off. The PR campaign titled ‘Uncover the Truth’, was executed in partnership with the Neth FM radio station and its online channels, to promote the Act’s usage among the public.
“The ‘Uncover the Truth’ campaign beat out four other Platinum-nominated campaigns for ‘Best in Show’. Last week was a proud moment for all of us in Ogilvy Asia Pacific. Thank you, team Sri Lanka for making us so proud,” said, Scott Kronick, Ogilvy Public Relation’s President and CEO for Asia Pacific. Speaking on the win, Irvin Weerackody, Chairman, Ogilvy Group Sri Lanka, said: “Once considered a stepchild in the marketing world, Public Relations is now a potent tool in marketing and of course in championing public service initiatives.
Ogilvy PR has been tremendously successful in the use of best practices in PR in crisis management and strategising public service campaigns over the last few years.
The campaign for the Right to Information Act is such an example, and a landmark campaign.
Apart from winning the Platinum award for the best in Asia Pacific, the ‘Uncover the Truth’ campaign draws attention to a new law in Sri Lanka that forced disclosure of information held by public authorities and has given hope to the relatives of victims of human rights violations, and many others.
It was hailed as a great example of a public service campaign by Paul Holmes, Founder of the Holmes Report and Chairman of the SABRE Awards, in light of a recent controversial PR campaign done in South Africa to incite racial tensions.”
