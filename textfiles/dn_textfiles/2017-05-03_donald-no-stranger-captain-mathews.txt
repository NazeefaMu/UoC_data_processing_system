Donald no stranger to captain Mathews

New fast bowling consultant Allan Donald will be reviving ties with Sri Lanka captain Angelo Mathews after undertaking a two-month contract with Sri Lanka Cricket for the Champions Trophy.
Donald was the head coach of Pune Warriors that was captained by Mathews during the IPL in 2013.
Mathews expressing his views on Donald’s appointment said, “We are indeed grateful to SLC for providing us with all the support we need both in terms of technology and expertise.
"I have been given the best possible team and the resource personnel that have been supporting us are nothing short of fantastic. The addition of a legend like Allan Donald will be an invaluable step up for us especially in English conditions. It is now up to us to give it our all in the middle and firmly raise the flag on high.”
Manager Cricket Asanka Gurusinha said: “I am most pleased that this administration is quite literally pulling out all the stops when it comes to strategic investment in the cricketing area. Sri Lanka has all the talent in the world, but needs a solid injection of technology and expert input to get it where it needs to be, and that is exactly what this administration is giving it.” – ST
