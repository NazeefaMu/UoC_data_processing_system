Air Force cycle race to coincide with anniversary celebration

The Air Force in commemoration of its 67th anniversary which falls on March 2, has announced that the most awaited event on its calendar - Air Force Day - would be held this year at the SLAF Station in Ampara.
The 67th Air Force Day Exposition and Tattoo is to be signified by a three-day event which includes a line-up of aerobatic displays, parachute display, fly past, a display by the Regimental Special Forces, air dog show, band and drill displays.
Speaking at the launch of the event, Air Vice Marshal Sagara Kotakadeniya said that the event would showcase the SLAF’s military proficiency as well as its capabilities to handle its role in the national and regional landscape.
He added that such an event would also serve as an awareness and educational programme where ordinary citizens can interact with officers and learn of the Air Force’s prowess.
The SLAF’s multipurpose air assets would also be on display, to demonstrate to the public its military capabilities in offensive roles and in providing humanitarian assistance. The Tattoo is scheduled to be held from March 3-5 and will showcase stalls from various units of the Air Force, along with kids’ play areas and food stalls.
In addition to the red-letter day commemoration, the Air Force will also hold its annual Guwan Hamuda Papedi Sawariya for the 19th consecutive year. The event which will coincide with the anniversary celebrations, will also be held over three days.
The race will begin on March 3 from the Air Force Headquarters in Colombo, passing each leg through Puttalam, Hingurakodga, Polonnaruwa, and Batticaloa, with the finish line being at the Youth Centre in Ampara. The race will cover a distance of 447.4 km and will also see the participation of Air Force comrades from India and Pakistan as well.
The race which is ranked at national level and is often quoted as the longest race, is being held under the auspices of the Cycling Federation of Sri Lanka. Over 100 men and 30 women are expected to compete in this race.
In addition to daily allowances for the cyclists, the Air Force has also made other arrangements including their accommodation and other miscellaneous expenses.
The Air Force is also working with the Sri Lanka Police and the Railways Department to ensure that there is a free flow of traffic throughout the race.
