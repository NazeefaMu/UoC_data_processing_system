Sancharaka Udawa  2017 concludes

The seventh edition of ‘Sancharaka Udawa’ concluded at Sirimavo Bandaranaike Memorial Exhibition Center at BMICH last week end.
This exhibition was first organized on a small scale seven years ago, by the Sri Lanka Association of Inbound Tour Operators (SLAITO), with the intention of providing a platform to showcase products and services offered by the smaller stake holders in the tourism industry.
The success of the exhibition, was amply displayed by the demand for stalls which currently stands at around 190 and growing.
Exhibitors ranged from Boutique Hotels to Guest Houses to Camping Operators on the accommodation offerings, as well as Adventure and Activity Service providers such as Safari Jeep Operators, rafting, canoeing and surfing operators from around the Island.
Due to the success of the seminars that were held last year during the exhibition on various topics related to the tourism industry, the organizers also add several seminars to this years’ exhibition too.
