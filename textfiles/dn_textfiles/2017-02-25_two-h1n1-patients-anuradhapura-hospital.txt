Two H1N1 patients at Anuradhapura Hospital

Two patients admitted to the Anuradhapura Hospital have been diagnosed with the H1N1 virus.
This is the first time the hospital has admitted patients with H1N1 and the doctors report that the patients were residents of Kilinochchi who came to the hospital for treatment.
Young children and pregnant mothers arriving at the hospital have been warned to be cautious and alerted on the any spread of infection.
Hospital Director Dr. S. Akilendan told the Daily News that the two patients have been transferred to the Intensive Care Unit for treatment and that all measures have been taken to curtail the spread of the infection.
