The Mount Lavinia Magistrates Court suspended sessions today after weapons, believed to have brought to the court premises for an attack, were found inside the court premises.
A fully loaded pistol, a revolver and ten bullets were found hidden in a bag inside the Court premises.
The finding comes just days after seven persons – including two prison officers – were killed in a shootout in Kalutara, when a prison bus came under fire by unidentified gunmen.
