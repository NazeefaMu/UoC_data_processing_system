Angela Lee:The world’s youngest martial arts  champion

When 20-year-old undefeated female professional mixed martial arts (MMA) fighter Angela Lee walks into the room it’s a slightly strange moment.
With a white frangipani flower behind her ear and her highlighted hair bouncing around her shoulders, the smiling 5 foot 4 inch Lee cuts a friendly figure.
Is this the same woman who appeared on pay-per-view TV around the world last May, punching, kicking and grappling to defeat experienced Japanese fighter Mei Yamaguchi?
The same fierce fighter who, aged 19, secured the inaugural ONE Championship (ONE) women’s atomweight title, becoming the world’s youngest MMA champion, earning her comparisons with boxing legend Mike Tyson, who achieved his first world title aged 20?
“As a small child growing up, I always wanted to be a world champion,” Lee tells CNN in Bangkok, where she is training for her next big fight.
Since achieving that goal, she has become one of the most popular MMA fighters in Asia -- male or female. She has thousands of followers on social media and is constantly cited by MMA journalists as one of the top athletes in the game.
Lee says it’s important for females to defend themselves.
Undefeated with six wins, five by submission -- including an ultra rare “twister” spinal lock submission -- Lee’s ground game is notoriously slick. As that frangipani hints, she has a style of her own.
A family of fighters 
Born in Canada to a Singaporean father and a South Korean mother, Lee comes from a family of fighters. Her three younger siblings -- two brothers and a sister -- all practice martial arts, while her parents are both highly decorated martial arts competitors and instructors.
Lee says she’s been training since she could walk.
And while it’s her dad, Ken, and her 18-year-old brother Christian -- also a professional fighter with ONE Championship -- that fans see in her corner on fight night, Lee credits her mother for teaching her to be a strong and independent woman.
“Growing up with my mom as a martial arts instructor, and also the additional values that I learned from mixed martial arts, really shaped me into the kind of person I am today,” she says. Her dad, meanwhile, gave her a versatile grounding in MMA, a sport that has evolved dramatically over the last 20 years and entails using a combination of moves from different martial arts disciplines to defeat an opponent. “Growing up with my dad, I was able to learn all those styles and incorporate them into the new style of MMA that is fought today,” says Lee.
“(I learned to use) everything from striking, boxing, kickboxing and Muay Thai to things like wrestling and judo on the ground. I think that’s the beautiful thing about this sport. It’s constantly forcing you to evolve and improve in all areas.”
Making a man’s world her own
Today Lee divides her time between Hawaii, where the family moved when she was young, and Singapore, where she’s a member of the Evolve fight team and competes with the ONE Championship organization -- considered by many to be the Asian equivalent of the Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC), an American organization and the largest MMA promoter in the world.
When Lee emerged victorious from her championship fight last May, her new contract with ONE reportedly made her one of the highest paid females in the history of any MMA organization in the world.
Though specific details about her contract haven’t been released, ONE founder Chatri Sityodtong has publicly said that Lee is now one of the top five best-paid fighters in his organization.
He wrote in a post on his Facebook page: “I believe in meritocracy and that is how all of my companies are run. Everyone should be afforded the equal opportunity to be the master of his/her own destiny through his/her thoughts, words, and actions.
