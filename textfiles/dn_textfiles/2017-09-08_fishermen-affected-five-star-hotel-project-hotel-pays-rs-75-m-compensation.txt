Fishermen affected by Five Star Hotel project: Hotel pays Rs. 7.5 m compensation

Five Madel fishermen's families who will lose their occupation and livelihood owing to a new hotel complex coming up in the Ahungalla beach received Rs 1.5 million each as compensation from the hotel management.
This was following the intervention of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources Development Minister Mahinda Amaraweera. The affected families received the relevant cheques from Minister Amaraweera at the Ministry auditorium on September 6. Secretary to the Ministry Mangalika Adhikari and the management of the hotel participated in the ceremony to provide compensation. Speaking on the occasion, Minister Amaraweera said the government would never allow ongoing development work to inconvenience the masses. “If by chance anyone was affected by such work, the government would intervene to provide compensation for them,” the minister said. Earlier, the five families affected by the ongoing hotel project complained to Minister Amaraweera saying that they would lose their main livelihood due to the project.
When the Minister discussed the matter with the hotel management, they agreed to make compensation payments to the affected families.
The minister said steps will be taken to provide compensation to fishermen who lose their livelihoods in bait fishing. Funds of Rs. 500,000 each will be provided to these fishermen.
