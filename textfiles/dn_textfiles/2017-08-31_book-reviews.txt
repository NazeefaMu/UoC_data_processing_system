BOOK  REVIEWs

Tuan M Zameer Careem’s Persaudaraan- Malay Life in Sri Lanka will be launched on September 6 at the College of Surgeons, Noel and Nora Bartholomeusz Centre, No 06, Independence Avenue, Colombo 07.
It is truly a privilege to be invited by the author, Tuan M. Zameer Careem, to launch the rebirth of his second revised and enlarged published edition of PERSAUDARAAN: Malay Life in Sri Lanka (2017). My only exposure to the knowledge of Sri Lankan Malays thus far has been primarily provided by the writings of my personal scholar -historian friend, Dr. Bacha Husmiya, with whom I shared some productive postgraduate moments at Monash University, Melbourne and ended up together again recently as fellow academics working at the same University of Brunei Darussalam (UBD).
Tuan M Zameer Careem’s revised edition is certainly a labour of love and a work of meticuluous details, which is both historical and ethnographical. Specifically focusing on the different life aspects of the diasporic Malays in Sri Lanka, the book will undoubtedly provide many “windows” to the study of Malays in a comparative context. As an anthropologist researching into Malays in Peninsular Malaysia in the context of their changing cultural values and socio-economic transformation, I am excited about the possibilities of Zameer Careem’s book in providing ‘comparative’ answers to some of the critical questions arising from this particular Malaysian discourse . For instance, how could we utilize the Malay Sri Lankan ethnographic and historical data base to engage in the counter-narrations against ‘colonial knowledge’ or the colonial/post- colonial discourse on orientalising the Malays , as has been elegantly argued in S. Hussein Alatas’s The Myth of the Lazy Native’ (1977). Are there concrete markers of high achievement orientations amongst Malay subjects in Sri Lanka as a result of their diasporic environment? How relevant is the nature of the debate pertaining to Malay ‘development’ and ‘underdevelopment’ in the Sri Lankan context? These above questions pertaining to the many facets of ‘being Malay’ remain critical research issues among scholars of contemporary Malay society in Malaysia.
As scholars, there is always something spiritual and intangible that binds us together. Within this epistemic community we occupy a similar ‘knowledge-scape’ (after Appadurai) in which we share, collaborate (even contest) and exchange ideas. From the geographical location of the Malay world to which can be traced the genesis of Sri Lankan Malays, I speak on behalf of my Malaysian scholars in welcoming Tuan M Zameer Careem’s new birthing of his Malay Life in Sri Lanka.
Tuan M Zameer Careem is a fourth year Medical Student at National University, Ukraine. He is an Alumnus of Royal College, Colombo 07. He is a freelance journalist and a regular contributor to the local and International Print Media. His First scholarly tome, “Persaudaraan- Malay Life in Sri Lanka” (Firstt Edition) which was launched in 2016, is available for reference at the National Archives, Colombo, Stanford University Library, United States of America and at the National Libraries of Sri Lanka and Australia. His first edition was used as a reference by Professor Hussainmiya in writing the account on Malays for the anthropological tome titled “Peoples of Sri Lanka” published by the Ministry of National Coexistence, Dialogue and Languages, which was launched under the patronage of the President Maithripala Sirisena on the July 18 at the BMICH, Colombo. Tuan M Zameer Careem, is one of the few authors who have the distinction of their First Edition being sold out within a year of its publication. The foreword for the book was written by Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe.
