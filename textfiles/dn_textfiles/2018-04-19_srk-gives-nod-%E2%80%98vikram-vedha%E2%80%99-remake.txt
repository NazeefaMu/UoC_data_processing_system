SRK gives a nod for ‘Vikram Vedha’ remake

Recently there were rumours that Shah Rukh Khan might not star in the Hindi remake of 2017 neo-noir Tamil drama, 'Vikram Vedha'. But now reports have it that the actor has finally given a nod for the project.
According to a report by an online portal, SRK wanted two major changes in the script, but the makers were unwilling to accommodate them initially. However, after Neeraj Pandey acquired the remake rights of the film SRK's demands were eventually fulfilled and Neeraj is keen on having Shah Rukh Khan on board for the project.
If reports are to be believed then Shah Rukh Khan was offered Madhavan's role in the remake but SRK demanded to play the role of Vijay Sethupathi. Earlier the makers were not sure about the same but latest reports suggest that they have agreed to SRK's demand.
Initially, there were reports speculating that the original director duo, Pushkar, and Gayatri will be directing the remake. But SRK wasn't convinced about the same and wanted Neeraj Pandey to direct the film. Reportedly the makers have even agreed to this demand. Official announcements of the project are yet to be made.
Currently, Shah Rukh Khan is shooting for Aanand L Rai’s 'Zero'. The film also stars Anushka Sharma and Katrina Kaif in key roles. 'Zero' is slated to release on December 21.
