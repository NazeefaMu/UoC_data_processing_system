Drawn together

The legacy that the British left behind in this land is a tough read. They left behind many things from infrastructure to the Sinhala-only furore. Yet one notable feature of the colonial legacy of Sri Lanka is the verdant vocabulary to illustrate the local culture. This could be said about most colonial countries which are now independent, sovereign, states.
Postcolonial writing shines among them. It has evolved into a subject critically studied at the universities across the globe. As everyone can easily understand, postcolonial writing essentially deals with a literature born following the colonial rule.
Sri Lanka, though not as ample as its neighbour, India, contributed to postcolonial literature in its own way. It later evolved into South Asian Diasporic writings, because of the migration that took place from South Asian countries to other foreign countries such as Australia and Britain. It continues to spread its wings across the world as most writers began sharing their experiences of living in two cultures; one of their motherland and the other of the domiciled country.
Sri Lanka has produced only a handful of writers to this sphere. Chandani Lokuge belongs to that handful. Two of her literary works, If the Moon Smiled and Turtle Nest have been reprinted by Australian Scholarly Publishing in Melbourne.
Lokuge travelled to South Australia in 1996 to complete her doctorate at Flinders University as an Australian Commonwealth Scholar from Sri Lanka. Her study focused on the pioneering Indian women’s autobiography and fiction written in English. She obtained her Master’s from Peradeniya University for researching English fiction in Sri Lanka with reference to three literati: Leonard Woolf, James Goonewardene and Punyakanta Wijenaike.
Now as Associate Professor of Literary Studies and Creative Writing Programme at Monash University, Lokuge has founded the South Asian Diaspora International Researchers’ Network. She has co-partnered the network with Dr Mridula Chakraborty, (Deputy Director, Monash Asia Institute, Monash University), Professor Astrid Erll (Institute for English and American Studies at Goethe University Frankfurt), Professor Susheila Nasta, (Chair of Modern Literature at the Open University London, and Editor-in- Chief Wasafiri: The Magazine of International Contemporary Writing), Professor Annalisa Oboe, (English Literature and Postcolonial Studies in the Department of Linguistic and Literary Studies, University of Padua.) Dr Chris Ringrose (School of Languages, Literatures, Cultures and Linguistics, Monash University), Professor Frank Schulze-Engler (Professor of New Anglophone Literatures and Cultures at the Institute for English and American Studies at Goethe University Frankfurt), Professor Klaus Stierstorfer, (Chair of British Studies at Munster University, Germany) and Professor Janet Wilson, (Professor of English and Postcolonial Studies at the University of Northampton; Editor, Journal of Postcolonial Writing, University of Northampton).
The network reaches out to academics and writers who focus on the South Asian Diaspora in their works. With their work on display, the network will offer a creatively and intellectually charged platform to expand a research and educational collaboration.
It will nurture research, teaching and public discussion around and by the South Asian diaspora, and through that, engage in the global debate.
“We invite all internationally established scholars as well as early-career, postdoctoral and postgraduates interested in this project to register on this network, and share your innovative research and writing ideas that may lead to important collaborations and connections between the creative, literal, theoretical, institutional, political, social, historical, pedagogical, and the symbolical. This unique international, inter-university and interdisciplinary research platform provides traditional (academic) and non-traditional (creative) researchers with the opportunity to instigate new ways of talking together about the South Asian diaspora, its past, present, and future directions, and highlight the importance of transnational dialogues. Outcomes may include co-authored funding applications and publications, symposia and conferences, and public lectures,” Dr Chandani Lokuge notes.
According to the Monash University website, the data generated by this research project will be stored on VicNode via monash.figshare.com, Monash University’s publicly accessible data repository.
“This is a secure and long-term option, which also maximises the discoverability of the data. Both the data and metadata will be searchable via monash.figshare, figshare.com and Google. Each record in monash.figshare will be allocated a DOI, providing a stable and permanent link to the data. In addition, a Research Project will be created in the AustLit database. This will provide a description of different aspects of the research project, for example, archival material and ongoing research. The AustLit record will link to the monash.figshare record, and the data it contains, using the monash.figshare DOI. Similarly, the monash.figshare record will link to the AustLit record via a URL pointing to the AustLit Research Project. This will result in the data being publicly searchable and accessible worldwide,” the website adds.
As Deputy Associate Dean, International Engagement from 2013-2014 incl., Chandani Lokuge developed the Monash Joint-Award PhD programme and chaired the Convening Committee of the biennial international conference of the European Association for Studies of Australia (2014). She founded and directed the Monash Centre for Postcolonial Writing from 2002-2011.
Chandani has authored 14 books so far which includes three novels.
