Deepavali bonanza for estate workers

 
The government on the instructions of Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe has taken measures to grant an additional Deepavali allowance of Rs. 3,500 to estate workers.
This is in addition to the previous allowance of Rs. 6,500.
The additional allowance will be granted to the workers as a credit allowance.
Plantation Industries Minister Navin Dissanayake instructed the authorities to issue monetary assistance to estate industries to pay the allowance.
The government had taken this decision following discussions between Prime Minister Wickremesinghe, Minister Dissanayake, Finance Ministry Secretary Dr. Samaratunga, Prime Minister's consultant R. Paskaralingam and Tea Board chairman Rohan Pethiyagoda.
