India beats Pakistan in other semi-final clash:
Mendis steers Sri Lanka to ACC Emerging Teams Asia Cup final

Kamindu Mendis played a match-winning innings of 91 not out off 88 balls (9 fours) to steer Sri Lanka to the final of the ACC Emerging Teams Asia Cup when they beat Bangladesh by four wickets in the semi-final played at the R Premadasa Stadium yesterday.
Sri Lanka will meet India in the final scheduled for December 15 at the R Premadasa Stadium. India beat Pakistan in the other semi-final played at CCC yesterday.
Sri Lanka chasing 238 for victory lost their first four wickets for 87 runs including that of captain Shammu Ashan for 18. But Mendis figured in two half-century partnerships with Shehan Jayasuriya (39) and Asela Gunaratne (24) to see Sri Lanka home with 10 balls to spare.
Earlier fast bowler Chamika Karunaratne captured four wickets for 31 runs in a brilliant spell to dismiss Bangladesh for 237 in 49.1 overs.
Opener Mizanur Rahman scored 72 off 95 balls and Yasir Ali Chowdhury 66 off 72 balls to help Bangladesh to 200-5 in the 44th over before they lost their last five wickets for 37 runs in 34 balls falling to the pace of Karunaratne and Asitha Fernando.
In the other semi-final played at the CCC grounds, India dominated Pakistan to pull off a comfortable win by seven wickets and qualify for the final.
Pakistan’s batting collapsed for 172 to the leg-spin of Mayak Markande who took four wickets for 38 runs.
India recovered from losing three wickets for 52 runs to overhaul Pakistan’s total through an unbroken stand of 126 between Himmat Singh (59 n.o. off 58 balls, 3 fours, 5 sixes) and Nitish Rana (60 n.o. off 60 balls, 6 fours, 3 sixes).
