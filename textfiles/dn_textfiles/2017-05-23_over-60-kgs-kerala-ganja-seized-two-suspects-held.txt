Over 60 kgs of Kerala Ganja seized Two suspects held

Excise officials yesterday seized a consignment of Kerala Ganja weighing over 60 kilograms at Waikkala.
The consignment worth over Rs. 6 million was being transported from Jaffna to Negombo. According to sources, the Excise Department on a tip-off has deployed a decoy to purchase the consignment. However, the drug smugglers who became suspicious about the purchaser, have attempted to flee when the vehicle reached Madampe.
The Excise officials have given a chase and apprehended two suspects at Waikkala with the consignment of Kerala Ganja and six mobile phones. One suspect is a German national, married to a Sri Lankan in Negombo.
The suspects were to be produced before the Chilaw magistrate.
