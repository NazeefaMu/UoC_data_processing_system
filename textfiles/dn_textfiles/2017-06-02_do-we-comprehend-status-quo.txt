Do we comprehend status quo?

Sri Lanka seems to be entrapped in a vortex of trouble, in a bundle of contradictions. Multiple crises confront it at present. Do we comprehend this status quo? Or do we perceive them partially or in one dimension?
Naturally attention is fixed at the moment to the deluge and the accompanying disasters. In the meantime the scourge of dengue and associated epidemic of AH1N1 influenza drops off the radar of public consciousness. Nor is the Highest Common Factor of both – environmental damage placed in its proper perspective.
To put it differently Sri Lanka is plagued with a major contradiction between nature and man as manifested in numerous phenomena such as floods, landslides, drought, contamination of ground water, soil and sea erosion, shifting of the water table etc. The much talked about man-elephant conflict is also a facet of the same contradiction. Disasters, both man-made and seemingly natural also stem from the same contradiction.
Waste management techniques
On the fertile ground of these contradictions grow socio-economic contradictions, which nevertheless take centre stage very often. Even they are eclipsed by the blowing up of minor contradictions in the political sphere caused by a ceaseless struggle for power between contending parties. That is why even in the aftermath of the present great deluge politicians seem to argue which of them faced such disasters more bravely or which managed crisis situations better. Forgotten is the fact that all these politicians are equally to be blamed even for the present disaster for the causes that gave rise to it did not arise overnight but were present for a long period.
Relief and rehabilitation measures are the immediate concerns of the government and the masses. It is rightly so. Yet our experience up to now seems to be that long-term and effective solutions to prevent the recurrence of such disasters were never taken up with the seriousness they deserve. Often even foreign aid that is received in instances of such disasters was not utilized productively. For example, there was large consignment of bicycles donated by China as flood relief to ease the transportation problems of the peasants affected by floods was un-utilized for years. It is also well known how tsunami relief went to private bank accounts of some political luminaries and how certain NGOs prospered with tsunami aid.
Flood protection technologies as well as waste management techniques are available in the world and if there was a will much could have been done by now. The late Dr. S A Wickremesinghe, Leader of the Communist Party has been campaigning for such multi-purpose projects to solve these problems from the 1940’s onwards or even earlier. All he received was scorn in return.
Grandiose are the schemes politicians weave at times of disaster but few have moved from the realm of fantasy to the realm of reality. We could recall, for example, the proposal made in the aftermath of the tsunami to build a parallel railway track to the present coastline railway line.
It is not yet understood that only a holistic approach to the multiple crises we face and a united effort on the part of the Government and the civil society could free Sri Lanka from the critical situation that she is facing today.
Unfortunately all governments including the present seem to trust not such an approach and such unity for they have been relying more on bureaucratic and militaristic solutions. For example, the main plank of the dengue eradication programme is bringing heads of households with mosquito breeding grounds in their premises before Courts of law with the assistance of the security forces. Intrinsically this method has a confrontationist approach. How could such a method solicit public cooperation and understanding? It is a method in which ownership is entirely in the hands of the State and not even a slightest degree of much touted public-private participation is visible there.
Environmental issue
What is required is mass mobilization on a voluntary basis followed by an educative mass information campaign. To do so the problem has to be understood not as a health issue but basically an environmental issue with a wide impact on health and many other spheres of human activity. Also all attempts at tackling the problem have been based on a top-down approach model with a Presidential Task Force at the Center. However, what is more productive would be a bottom-up approach starting at the village or city ward level and reaching the top at the level of a Presidential Task Force.
At present local government bodies and local government people’s representatives are not organically linked to the dengue eradication programme. At best they are bystanders in a programme conducted by the health authorities. Politicians who would at the drop of a hat gather hundreds of supporters for their party political shows never venture to mobilize the public for a clean environment programme, thus betraying their lack of political will.
Not only do they lack political will but also they are not sensitive to the sufferings of the people. That is why they go after luxury vehicles and other comforts which the ordinary masses could never dream of at huge costs to the public exchequer, even at times of calamity as the present.
The Government is reported to have temporarily, i.e. till the end of the year, suspended the import of vehicles for MPs and Ministers, perhaps with a view to deflate public pressure against it. However, the disasters could recur periodically and at best they would alternate with periods of vehicle imports for the politicians.
What is necessary is to grasp the depth of our problem. No amount of beautiful plans and aspirations could wipe off the reality that Sri Lanka is in a vortex of crises. Tough times necessitate tough decisions and it should be tough for everybody not just for the masses. Foreign aid that is basically earned by our expatriate workers and those in the plantation and productive sectors should be prudently spent. Extravagant festivals, even religious ones, should be curtailed, strict auditing and accounting should be undertaken. A moratorium of foreign debt payments for at least five years negotiated with the donors.
Politicians should stop the bickering over trivia and concentrate on nation building.
