Portrayal of women in media
Doomed to objectification

Many concerns remain about how women are represented in media. The pressure put on women through advertisements, television, film and new media to be sexually attractive is profound. Although roles for women on television and how they are portrayed is varying at present there are issues that have to be addressed.
Ministry of Women and Child Affairs organised a workshop to create a media policy on presentation of women in media.
Speaking at the conference, Sri Lanka Broadcasting Corporation, Chairman, Sudarshana Gunawardena said women are working predominantly in the middle-level areas of the media industry.
“Women can be presenters or newscasters, but never producers. Due to this kind of exclusion, men hold most top jobs in the media, which could be a reason for the rather lop-sided manner in which women are portrayed in the media,” he said.
He went on to add that market is deciding how a woman should be projected in media. “This ideology should be changed. Women should attempt to go against this norm and aim for top-level jobs in the industry by making civil society more aware of this gender-based hierarchy that exists within the media today,” Gunawardena said.
Women as sexual objects

Provocative images of women’s partly clothed or naked bodies are especially prevalent in advertising. Women’s bodies are sexualized in advertisements in order to grab the viewer’s attention. Women become sexual objects when their bodies and their sexuality are linked to products that are bought and sold.
The presence of misinformation and media stereotypes is disturbing and today young people often turn to media for information about sex and sexuality.
Researchers argue that the over-representation of thin women in mass media reinforces the conclusion that “physically attractive” means “thin.” A study of women’s magazine reveals that messages about weight loss are often placed next to messages about men and relationships.
Former Head of Mass Media and Communication Department of Kelaniya University, Professor Rohana Luxman Piyadasa speaking on 'Women in Media’ said most of the themes and characters in tele dramas are woven around women. “There are around 46 tele dramas telecast at present during a week highlighting a heroine. In 1960/70 most journalists were men but this has changed. More women are involved in media both in print and electronic. With the scenario changing the question of how women can be fairly treated arises,” Professor Piyadasa said.
He said a research carried out by the University revealed that out of the tabloids and magazines published during the weekend, around 14 to 15 magazines target women.
“The advertisements placed in theses tabloids direct women to illiteracy. The advertisements that make up more than 40 per cent of the paper are on beauty products, mythology, medicine and food. Some of these products are unhealthy and have no standards. Violence against women is not only physical but also mental. Mother or the housewife who is the decision maker of the family watches these advertisements which will influence the choices she makes and will in turn affect the well being of the society,” Professor Piyadasa added.
He also said Sociologists say the family should at least have one meal together but today children consume fast food as a result of both parents being employed. “Children are trapped in their own world. Parents are not aware of the activities of children. Thus we see an increase in children being abused mentally and physically,” Professor said.
“The increase of internet penetration has devoured children. In 2011, there were 20 million telephones but in 2017 mobile subscribers increased to 40 million. This creates easy access to around 4.2 million web pages for pornography and those websites earn more than Google, Yahoo, Netflix, Amazon and Apple. Woman is used to make profits and as a sexual idol. These ideologies should be changed through researches. Social equality should be given to women in estates, Sri Lankan housemaids and other women workers who contribute to the growth of country’s economy,” he pointed out.
Women in politics
Women in politics in the modern age are under-represented in most countries worldwide, in contrast to men. Nevertheless, they are progressively being elected to be heads of state and government. Currently, more than 20 countries in North and South America, Australia and Africa have a woman holding office as head of government and the global participation rate of women in politics is approximately 20 per cent.
The media refuses to consider female politicians as regular human beings. They feel the need to emphasize and to some extent exaggerate their emotional, feminine side and downplay the intelligence, power and responsibility. They tend to go into great detail about the personal lives of female candidates, which is contrasting to the way they portray men.
With female representation as low as 6 per cent in the national legislature, despite the 51 per cent of Sri Lankan population constituting of women, appears to be an issue that needs to be addressed with haste.
The government’s decision to introduce 25 per cent quota for women in the local government, will bring women who are active in many community based organisations at village level into political engagement in the country which will help ensure a more democratic political culture.
Secretary to the Ministry of Women and Child Affairs, Chandrani Senaratna said the country has to create a safer environment for women. “First victim is the girl child and next will be the woman. Woman is a unique and a complete creation. We have to create a safer environment for them and they should be encouraged to do meaningful politics. The ministry will organise training for women entering politics. Most women in villages don’t know their rights and lack the knowledge to take up decision making positions. We have more aging population which has to be addressed and they have to be educated on reproduction as well. President granted 76 million rupees to uplift livelihood in rural areas. Lots of programmes are going on but are the people really uplifted? Are they informed? Media has to take the message to the society,” she pointed out.
