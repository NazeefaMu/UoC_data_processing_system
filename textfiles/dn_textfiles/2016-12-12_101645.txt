Seattle Sounders beat Toronto to win MLS Cup

TORONTO: The Seattle Sounders became Major League Soccer champions for the first time with a 5-4 penalty shoot out win over Toronto FC after the MLS Cup final ended goalless after extra-time on Saturday.
Seattle did not make a shot on target throughout 120 minutes of action but defender Roman Torres blasted in the decisive spot-kick to leave the home crowd deflated after Toronto’s first ever final appearance. It was a largely scrappy encounter but Toronto had the better chances, especially in extra-time where Seattle’s Swiss keeper Stefan Frei produced a brilliant save to keep out a Jozy Altidore header.
Seattle entered MLS in 2009 and have reached the play-offs in every season but were appearing in their first championship game.
US international striker Altidore went close to an early opener in just the second minute wide when he found a little space on the left but screwed his shot just wide of the far post.
The home side continued to press forward in the early stages with Jonathan Osorio forcing former Toronto keeper Frei into a low save.
Toronto’s biggest attacking threat, Italian striker Sebastian Giovinco, had two opportunities with free-kicks from distance but both times he struck the ball into the wall.
In the freezing conditions, both sides struggled to find much in the way of fluent possession and while Paraguayan Nelson Valdez showed some good touches for Seattle he lacked real support.
Goalless at the break, Toronto would have been happy with their aggressive work in midfield but they too needed to find a way to better supply their forwards. - AFP
