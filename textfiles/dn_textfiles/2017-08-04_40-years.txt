40 years on

Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe will be felicitated by parliament today to mark his completion of 40 years in politics. The Public Gallery, no doubt, will be packed by well wishers, particularly old UNP supporters of Wickremesinghe, from the Biyagama electorate, to bid him success and many more years of service to the nation. There will also bound to be reminiscence and nostalgic memories of the happenings 40 years ago, when, Samanthurai, the first result announced, heralded the UNP avalanche that ended with the Grand Old Party winning 140 of the 168 seats on offer and an unprecedented five sixth majority.
Much water has flown under the bridge since the fresh faced youth of 28 entered the old parliament by the sea, having won the Biyagama seat by a majority of over 6,500 votes. Young Ranil was immediately thrust into a position of responsibility by being appointed Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs to apprentice under senior stalwart A.C.S. Hameed. He also had the opportunity to work and move with giant figures of the UNP who had been in the legislature when he was just a kid, such as E.L. Senanayake, E.L. B. Hurulle and of course JRJ himself and the knowledge and experience gained, no doubt, stood him in good stead for the long career in politics he embarked upon, since.
Of course it was not a bed of roses all the way. To say that Ranil's was a chequered political career would be a monumental understatement. Forty years is a long time in politics and to survive that long in the game, traversing a path strewn with myriad obstacles, vicissitude and emerge unscathed to adorn the helm of affairs speaks a lot for the resilience and resourcefulness of Premier Wickremesinghe. He was of course adept at taking the rough with the smooth, as demonstrated by the many comebacks he made after being written off as a has been and consigned to history. He also demonstrated that he was not a man in a hurry and bided his time until the beckoning of destiny. The dividends no doubt paid off, given his gradual emergence as a matured politician with the passage of time and now a leader of international stature.
There was no leader in Sri Lanka who was insulted, reviled, ridiculed and slandered as Ranil Wickremesinghe, in the post independence Sri Lanka, but showing true leadership qualities and displaying the patina of a true Buddhist he took them all with equanimity and philosophically. He displayed his cultured upbringing and rich pedigree by respecting the views of others and not resorting to abuse of his opponents, however much provoked. His responses were always measured, often laced with wit and humour during parliament debates. A true gentleman to the core, he always held himself with calm dignity, showing the true qualities of a leader.
No doubt Ranil Wicremesinghe occupies a special place in the post independence history of Sri Lanka as an innovative leader with modern thinking and vision for the country, especially its youth. Calm and composed as always he never lost his cool even amidst the gravest provocation which perhaps riled his opponents even more than anything else. Known for his integrity, fairness and honesty, even his worst critics will concede that Wickremesinghe is above board in matters of propriety and never compromised his values and ethical standards.
He is today the Lankan politician who held the office of Prime Minister the most number of times.
Of course prior to the present one, all his tenures were truncated ones. The first occasion was a period of one and half years following the demise of President Premadasa. Though elected to office again as Premier in 2001, parliament was terminated by CBK after two years. He was sworn in again as PM in 2105 with the victory of President Sirisena and was elected to parliament in August that year to be made PM once more.
His opportunity to become the Executive President was thwarted twice, on both occasions curtsy the LTTE. The first time was when an LTTE female suicide bomber blew herself up at Town Hall blinding Chandrika in one eye and in the process unleashing a wave of sympathy in the South. The last occasion was when Prabhakaran engineered a voter boycott in the North and East in 2005, paving the way for Mahinda Rajapaksa to be President.
Premier Wickremesinghe, though, was unfazed by these setbacks and typically took them in his stride, not blaming the other side or making wild allegations, which, no doubt, went a long way towards enhancing his political stock.
Monumental challenges confronting the country lie ahead which needs the statecraft and undoubted skills of the Premier. President Sirisena will depend heavily on his PM to resurrect the country from the economic quagmire it has been consigned to by greedy politicians. With four decades of experience behind him Premier Wickremesinghe, no doubt, will be up to the task to ensure a turnaround of things soon, taking the country on the road to progress and prosperity.
