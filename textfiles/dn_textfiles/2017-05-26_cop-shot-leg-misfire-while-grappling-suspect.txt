Cop shot in leg in misfire while grappling with suspect

A policeman was injured in the leg and admitted to the Kegalle hospital when the service revolver of another colleague misfired when the colleague was grappling with a ransom-taker to arrest him at Hettimulla, Kegalle on May 24 night.
The two policemen had been on a raid to arrest two persons who had demanded a ransom of Rs 3 million from a businessman in Kegalle.
The businessman after informing the police had arranged a rendezvous with the two suspects at a given location on May 23 around 8 pm while the two policemen laid in ambush to arrest the two.
As the businessman was about to handover the money to the two suspects, the Police had pounced on them but one suspect had escaped from the scene. While one Policeman grappled with the other suspect and arrested him, his service revolver had misfired and accidentally shot the other policemen on the leg injuring him.
The arrested suspect who was also injured is receiving treatment at the same hospital under police guard. Further investigations are continuing.
