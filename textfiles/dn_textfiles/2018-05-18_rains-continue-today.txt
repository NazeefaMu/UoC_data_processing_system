Rains to continue today

Cloudy and showery conditions are expected in most parts of the island during the day due to low-level atmospheric disturbances in Sri Lanka, associated with the inter-tropical convergence zone, stated the Meteorological Department.
Showers and thundershowers will occur at times in the Western, Southern and Sabaragamuwa Provinces during the morning, while the same conditions could be expected in most parts of the island after 2 pm.
A rainfall of over 100 mm could be expected in the Central, Sabaragamuwa, Southern, Uva, Western and North Western Provinces and in the districts of Ampara and Batticaloa.
Sabaragamuwa and Central Provinces will be misty in the morning. Temporary strong winds and thundershowers are also expected and the general public is warned to take adequate action to minimise damage caused by lightning.
The possibility of showers around the sea area is also high, with showers and thundershowers expected off the coast from Puttalam to Batticaloa, Colombo and Hambantota. Showers and thundershowers can be expected at several sea areas at night.
Rainfall is also expected off the coast from Puttalam to Baticalaoa, Colombo and Galle.
The wind will blow towards the southwest direction at a speed of 20 to 30 km per hour. However, the wind speed can increase up to 45 to 50 km per hour in the areas from Puttalam to Kankasanturai via Mannar and Matara to Potuvil via Hambantota. Temporary strong gusty winds up to 70 to 80 km per hour and rough seas can be expected during thundershowers.
