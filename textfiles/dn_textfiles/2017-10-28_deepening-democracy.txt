Deepening democracy

It is a fact that this government has cleared the fascistic garbage left behind by the Mahinda regime. It is an achievement accepted by democratic people world over. However one has to concede that this set of achievements does not include most of the priority measures mentioned in the documents of international human rights officials, made over two years ago.
It makes obvious that the democratic process is nowhere close to where it should be. These expectations were not merely those of the international community but of the Yahapalanaya and of democratic Lankans generally. It was the Government’s ‘100 Day Programme’ that made commitments to its people concerning accountability.
The country committed itself to establishing in a two-year period (which lapsed in March of this year) measures on four different areas including, truth, justice, reparations and guarantees of no recurrence.
It is true in a world in which nation states are still the basic units of political organisation, the human rights architecture that they collectively construct is first and foremost, the expression of commitments to their own citizens, beyond being voluntary pledges. Primarily it shows the power of working people united internationally, because they bring pressure for better human rights, whatever government in power.
Prevention of Terrorism Act (PTA)
Some of the pending issues mentioned in related documents include: the release of land, the repeal of the Prevention of Terrorism Act (PTA) and its replacement by legislation that is fully compliant with human rights standards, the establishment of a mechanism to review expeditiously the cases of those held under the PTA, and the cessation of overbearing and intimidating forms of surveillance especially against women and human rights activists, left behind by the fascistic regime. To this, it is necessary to add the harassment of those involved in memorialization initiatives in the North and East. Each of these issues involves questions of basic rights and thus, the continued failure to achieve progress in fully addressing them constitutes a denial of justice.
Furthermore, the delays raise questions in many quarters about the determination of the government to undertake a comprehensive transitional justice programme. Although the land occupied by the Armed Forces, in some cases for decades, has been returned, the lack of clarity and comprehensiveness in the process is still a problem. In this work where the Armed Forces are both a party and the Judge, may have serious consequences from a developmental standpoint.
There is broad understanding among international community, of the fact that Lanka faced in the past serious security challenges based on Tamil national problem. Thus, Lanka has not only the right, but the obligation, to provide security for all, compatible with human rights and other standards such as right of self-determination.
Similarly, there is an understanding in the international community, of the challenges faced by countries that attempt to face legacies of abuses while they simultaneously engage in democratizing and ambitious constitutional reforms. However, long delays between the acknowledgment of obligations to establish transitional justice measures and the fulfilment of these obligations involve risks: no one should be under the impression that waiting is a costless alternative.
While the battle for better human rights and a democratic constitution is at the centre of stage, one pundit explains to us “When a pot of water heats up, small bubbles form, then bigger bubbles form, and convection currents begin to cause much agitation, increase of entropy and turbulence; the water is ready to undergo a “phase transition”. Water becomes steam. Social systems too, when highly stressed show increasing social turmoil, disruption and corruption. The normal course of justice is thwarted and those who control the purse begin to loot it.”
Vaguely he is explaining the social change as explained by Karl Marx. Lanka has passed a revolution in the presidential election and the struggle against negative forces is not yet over. If one goes by the news reports, Lanka is in a state close to conclude the transition that started with the victory of President Maithripala Sirisena. He has enough executive powers to take action and to arrest the negative forces with the support of Prime Minister Wickremesinghe. But, instead, an additional factor of conflict has been introduced by the attempt to stop change the rule book enabling devolution of the power and purse, to satisfy the democrats inside and outside the country.
Surely, given this cyber age where even a colony on the moon can be run from Cape Canaveral, devolution is a must for controlling power of ruling elites. Yet, fake histories are put forward to justify the arrest of such transfer of the power and purse, to the people who have traditionally lived in their so-called “traditional homelands”. They misquote from Ramayana, Arabian nights, both Bible and Koran to create unnecessary issues to counter historical truth and reality.
Re-writing the constitution
On the other hand, some who forgotten the gravity of the nationality problem, have pointed out that the priority should be to resolving civil discontent that is threatening not only the government but every citizen’s well- being! According to their ‘Marxist’ analysis, apparently proletarian uprising is on the way. No joke they are serious.
Hence they have questioned the need for re-writing the constitution at this hour. The first concern of a man falling into a fire cannot be a re-writing of the regulations for the fire brigade!
The external pressure for the change of constitution put in by the ‘US, UK and others working with a powerful diaspora’, has been sharply questioned, apparently this time not by Malwatta-Asgiri Theras but by some Lords in the British House of Lords, affirming what these pundits had already asserted. So, if the government wishes to abandon these ‘divisive projects’, it only has to capture the golden moment to suppress proletarians with the help of foreign friends. And yet, unfortunately the rewriting of the constitution seems to be so important to the government that the Prime Minister attacked newspaper editors in public for reporting the opposition of the Mahanayake to the attempt to change the constitution! Pundit asks is there a hidden meaning behind all this?
Political leadership
Both President and PM have come along different routes with different experiences. One is a village leader with a communist leaning to start with; the other is a Colombo Seven Royalist but with a father one time theoretician of Trotskyite Samasamajist movement grinning at him all the time!
However they have made a political combination in the category of social liberalism. So far they have faced criticism from all sides and moved forward. Still a massive people’s movement is active in the hope of achieving under this political leadership.
The attacks made by the fascistic opposition including the so-called unprecedented financial scandals are still treated as non entity by these liberal leaders. On the other hand while many investigations are made, and many arrests are made, no one is really caught and punished. This has become a negative aspect of social liberalism.
The inability to sharply break from chauvinism and eagerness of liberal duo to make compromises with certain leaders responsible for establishing fascism has created suspicion and anger among active leaders of mass democratic movement.
It is a defect identified by Trotsky, that liberal leaders are unable to stand firmly against chauvinism and to overthrow corrupt backward regimes to establish democracy. In Lanka, can the liberal leaders go ahead attacking chauvinist elements, finally to carry out the democratic duty of establishment of a constitution with a satisfactory power sharing?
