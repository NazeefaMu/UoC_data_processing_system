CR-Havies should be a close game

It will be an exciting tussle for supremacy when CR & FC lock horns with arch rivals Havelock Sports Club in the first leg of the Dialog ‘A’ Division inter club league rugby tournament match for the Commander Eustace Matthysz trophy at Longden Place, kick off will be at 4.00 pm today.
The trophy, is named after Commander Eustace Matthysz, a rugby stalwart and former dynamic Ceylon prop forward who also represented Sri Lanka Navy and Havelock’s SC with distinction before he brought fame and honour to the country as the President of the Asian Rugby Football Union in 1974. This coveted trophy is on offer since 1991 and was won by the CR & FC
outfit in the inaugural year, beating the Park Club by an aggregate of 14 points to 12.
It is the Park Club which won last year by winning both legs at Havelock Park as well as at Longden Place, hence they are the current holders of the trophy.
Going by how the two teams fared this season, Havies have a definite chance of pulling this game due to their unbeaten record so far and this makes the event a thrilling tussle.
The lads from the Longden Place lost their last match to Kandy Sports Club side last week at Nittawala grounds in Kandy while Havelock’s were really fortunate and just managed to secure victory against a gallant Police Sports Club outfit by 31 points to 26 at Police Park last week after a close game.
Red shirts will have the advantage when it comes to the two hookers where experience
Dulanjana Wijesinghe will strike it very much faster and will be the man to watch in the loose play than the Havies young hooker Azmeer Fajudeen.
The Park Club boys with the presence of a sturdy set of forwards who are capable of pulling the game in their favour will have to play a vital role in today's game and if the speedy three quarter line of the CR and FC spearheaded by their play maker cum vice captain Tharinda Ratwate and the present national winger and red shirts captain Kavindhu Perera delivers the goods, then it will be a daunting task for the Havelocks team to counter attack to notch up a much needed victory as they are having a very young inexperienced three quarter line this year.
