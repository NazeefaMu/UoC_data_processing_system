GMOA strike halts train services

The boycott of the Government Medical Officers Association (GMOA) against South Asian International Technology & Medicine (SAITM ) was reflected in Batticaloa yesterday.
The Out Patient Department (OPD) of the Batticaloa Teaching Hospital was not functioning from 8 am yesterday until 8.00 a.m. Today.
Doctors were present, but they did not perform their duties. However, the in-patients, urgent and serious patients were being treated.
Meanwhile, the train service stopped and the people were seeking alternative transport services.
