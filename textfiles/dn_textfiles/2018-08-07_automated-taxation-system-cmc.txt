Automated taxation system for CMC

The Knowledge Sharing Program (KSP) on policy consultation, supported by the Export-Import Bank of Korea (Korea Eximbank) to set up a master plan for the establishment of an advanced automated taxation system for the Colombo municipality, was successfully carried out from February to July. The final dissemination seminar was held on July 26 in Colombo with the participation of the Colombo Municipal Council (CMC) officials, including Deputy Municipal Commissioner Thamara Mallawarachchi, according to a press release from the Korean Embassy in Sri Lanka. Colombo is the economic centre of the country experiencing rapid urbanization and land development, resulting in higher tax rates imposed on land and buildings which account for 28 percent of the CMC total budget. However, due to the existing manual taxing method, the CMC is facing serious challenges such as uncertain data on taxable property, missing to charge tax, inefficient administrative procedures, etc.
Considering this need to build a strong tax information system, especially for the Colombo city which generates a considerably high amount of tax, this consulting program produced policy recommendations and a framework to promote the development of the future CMC tax administration system by capitalizing on the experience of establishing the advanced tax information system in Seoul, South Korea, the release stated.
