‘Certain N/E politicians attempting to damage reconciliation process’

Certain Northern and Eastern politicians are attempting to grab political power by damaging the reconciliation process among the communities and threatening the country’s unitary status, Western Province Governor Hemakumara Nanayakkara said.
The Western Province Governor was addressing the media at his office in Rajagiriya yesterday.
He said extremist politicians in the Northern and Eastern Provinces want the Army Camps in those areas removed in order to secure their vote base by misguiding the masses.
“Even the Tamil Diaspora wants to create a tense situation in those areas and thereby secure their foreign refuge,” he added.
“Certain international organisations try to create political instability and create a tense situation in the North in order to sell their weapons,” he said.
According to Nanayakkara, some Tamil politicians were enjoying luxury lives in Colombo while the Police and the Tri-Forces have been wirking with dedication to provide relief and rescue the Northern people affected by the floods.
“The Police and the Tri-Forces personnel have also donated blood to save the lives of the Northern flood victims,” he pointed out.
President Maithripala Sirisena had instructed the authorities in the Northern Province including Governor Reginald Cooray to take all possible measures to provide relief to those people, Nanayakkara said while criticizing some Northern politicians for not doing enough for the affected people.
“Only one death has been reported from the flood situation in the Northern Province. This is due to the dedication of the Police and the Security Forces personnel,” he said. Northern health personnel and other personnel from Government institutions have also rendered a yeomen service in the flood relief efforts,” he added.
Speaking about the removal of the military camps in the Northern Province, the Governor said nearly 80 per cent of the private lands acquired during the war period have now been released by the Army and steps are being taken to set up these Army camps in government owned lands.
