Minister Fonseka refutes allegations
‘No need to obtain underworld security’

Sustainable Development, Wildlife and Regional Development Minister Sarath Fonseka, flatly refuting certain allegations levelled against him by certain media that he is receiving the security of underworld king-pings, said he doesn’t need to do so as he receives enough security from the Special Task Force (STF) and the police.
“Seventeen police officers, including STF personnel, were deployed to provide security. Therefore, there is no need to obtain private security,” he said.
He was addressing the media at the ministry auditorium, on Thursday. When asked why such an allegation was levelled against him, he said it could be a hidden political agenda of some.
“Some may want to sling mud at me. Those are baseless allegations,” he said.
The minister said he complained about this to the Prime Minister and the subject minister and requested them to take measures against these allegations. A case will also be filed by the ministry claiming compensation of Rs. 500 million against the electronic media organisation, he said. However, the minister pointed out that media personnel should act responsibly without being a cat’s paw of bankrupt and corrupt politicians. The minister said the Police Commission has failed to achieve its goals when it was formed. “However, the situation worsened with the establishment of the Police Commission even though it was expected to give good results,” he said.
The minister added that there are some issues with good governance even though this is a good governance government. There is no ‘good governance’ in the field of law, he said. When asked about the preparation of former Defence Secretary Gotabhaya Rajapaksa to contest as the next Presidential candidate, the minister said Rajapaksa does not know the pulse of the public as he and the members of the Rajapaksa family spent a luxurious life during the last regime.
