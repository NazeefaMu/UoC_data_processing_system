Blow to big onion farming in Matale

The big onion farmers in the Matale district are inconvenienced due to the inclement weather experienced within the past few weeks. They are unable to commence their onion cultivations yet, they said.
During the last Yala season, about 8,000 acres were brought under big onion cultivation in the district. They reaped over 70,000 metric tons of big onions. It was 40 percent of the annual requirement.
Although the farmers have enough local onion seeds for the current Yala season, they could not prepare even the onion plots so far, under the existing situation.
A farmer in Narangahamula area, H. A. Jayasoma said: “My seed onion cultivation was very successful. However, due to the lack of anticipated rain, all our attempts were foiled while sufficient local big onion seeds are available”
Another farmer of Thalakiriyagama, W. G. Jayathilaka said: “The big onion cultivation in the current Yala season is not satisfactory owing to the inclement weather. We did not prepare even the onion plots.”
