Bonded by Buddhism

Any other year, Vesak would only be a religious event, but this year a political dimension has been added primarily by the Joint Opposition which has capitalised on Indian PM Narendra Modi’s visit to Sri Lanka for the UN Day of Vesak celebrations, being held here for the first time. Although the visit is entirely religious-oriented with a few social events, the Joint Opposition is indulging in a campaign spreading an India scare among especially the unsuspecting rural masses that the Indian PM will be here to sign an agreement that will cede control of the oil tanks in Trincomalee in India. Both Indian and Sri Lankan authorities have refuted this allegation. Modi, though not a Buddhist, is an ardent admirer of the religion and has started a drive to revive India’s Buddhist heritage.
Prime Minister Modi will go directly to the Gangaramaya Vesak Zone after he touches down at the Bandaranaike International Airport. He will jointly inaugurate the festivities there with Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe. He will thereafter join President Sirisena at dinner the same day and will be the Chief Guest at the official UN Day of Vesak ceremony to be held the next day. Prime Minister Modi is billed to talk about the heritage shared by the two countries and the life of the Buddha. Buddhism is India’s greatest gift to Sri Lanka and the presence of its Prime Minister at the UN Vesak Day deliberations can be considered a great honour. In fact, the Government has also invited the President of Nepal Bidhya Devi Bhandari to the UN Vesak Day celebrations, giving due recognition to the two countries where the Buddha once trod – Nepal and India.
The UN Vesak Day came into being due to the efforts of former Foreign Minister Lakshman Kadirgamar who rendered a great service to the country during the troubled times when Sri Lanka was facing a war with the LTTE. While campaigning against the terror outfit globally, he also found time to campaign for UN recognition of Vesak Day. The UN has been celebrating Vesak officially since 1999.
Indian Prime Minister’s visit
This year’s UN Vesak Day theme is “Buddhist Teachings for Social Justice and Sustainable World Peace”. A UN Vesak conference will be held under this theme, with the participation of over 4,000 delegates from 100 Buddhist and non-Buddhist countries. This has generated interest around the world since Buddhism is one of the fastest growing religions. It was reported that the events involving Prime Minister Modi will be watched by 1.2 billion people across India and Sri Lanka. The events will be featured live on Indian TV and the country will be the centre of attraction.
The Indian Prime Minister will also fly to Dikoya where he will declare open a hospital for the welfare of the people in the area including the estate workers of Indian origin. He will also participate in an interaction session with the people at the Norwood grounds. President Maithripala Sirisena and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe are also expected to join. A special advance squad was sent to the venue and the surroundings to make sure that wasps would not interfere with the proceedings. There have been a number of wasp attacks in the area.
Prime Minister Modi will visit Kandy later in the evening to receive the blessings of the two Most Ven. Mahanayakes of Malwatte and Asgiriya Chapters and leave for New Delhi thereafter.
According to diplomatic sources there are no economic objectives attached to the official visit of the Indian Prime Minister. It is a kind of pilgrimage, Indian High Commissioner Taranjit Singh Sandhu told journalists on Monday.
Despite claims by both the Sri Lankan Government and Indian authorities that no bilateral agreements are on the schedule during the visit, the Joint Opposition has claimed that the government was pawning the Trincomalee oil tanks to India. Hence it is important to explore the actual mechanism that led to the MoU signed between Sri Lanka and India during the recent visit of Premier Ranil Wickremesinghe to New Delhi. The fears of the Opposition are virtually unfounded since the development of oil tank farm in Trincomalee is a joint venture between Ceylon Petroleum Corporation and the Indian Oil Company (IOC). The investment ratio could be 50%-50% or thereabouts, depending on the quantum of investment needed to upgrade the oil tanks.
The oil tank farm built by the British during the Second World War was idling for a long time without being utilized. India has assured that developing it further would be the best option as it could not be used for any other purpose. Incidentally, the tank farm was also subjected to a kamikaze attack by a Japanese warplane pilot during World War II. The remains of the plane can still be found near one of the tanks.
There are a lot of misconceptions and theories about Indo-Lanka cooperation, with many saying that India is keen to counterbalance Chinese projects in Sri Lanka. But the economic angle seems to have been forgotten – for example, the economic zone in Hambantota, a huge investment by China, can be used to penetrate the Indian Market. It is time that Sri Lankans learned to think beyond the 21 million market at home. India has a population of 1.2 billion and China too is a one billion plus market. Our trade and tourism efforts must be focused in this direction.
Fears have been expressed about the Economic and Technical Cooperation Agreement (ETCA) with India which is under negotiation. Contrary to popular opinion, Indian doctors or other professional categories will not be able to come here en masse and take our jobs away following ETCA. There is no need for any agreements to fill labour shortages legally – Minister Patali Champika Ranawaka disclosed recently that as many as 200,000 foreign construction workers are already in Sri Lanka. But there is no such possibility for the medical profession, where the local output of doctors is adequate for healthcare needs.
While the JO did campaign against Prime Minister Modi’s visit, MP Wimal Weerawansa went a bit too far in calling on the people to hoist black flags on Vesak Day. Other members of the JO were quick to distance themselves from the MP’s remarks, which drew widespread condemnation from senior Buddhist monks, intellectuals and the common people. Social media users castigated the MP who found only one other voice in his defence – the equally controversial Ven. Galagodaaththe Gnanasara Thera of the Bodu Bala Sena.
Geetha’s Parliamentary Seat
The Appeal Court verdict on MP Geetha Kuamarasinghe’s eligibility to hold a Parliamentary Seat on account of her being a dual citizen has rattled a number of other MPs who hold dual citizenships. Secretary-General of Parliament Dhammika Dasanayake has informed the Chairman of the Election Commission that the MP post of UPFA Galle district Parliamentarian Geetha Kumarasinghe has been annulled in line with the Court of Appeal verdict. According to the newly introduced 19th amendment to the Constitution, a Sri Lankan Citizen holding citizenship status in another country cannot hold a seat in Parliament. They will surely watch on as she has already appealed to the Supreme Court to see where that leads, before taking any other action. Kumarasinghe has said that she renounced her Swiss citizenship sometime back. Several MPs have called on the Government to reveal the names of ministers and MPs who are dual citizens. Pivithuru Hela Urumaya (PHU) General Secretary and MP, Udaya Gammanpila requested the Controller of Immigration and Emigration to furnish the details of the parliamentarians who held dual citizenship. He attached a list of MPs in his letter to the Controller asking whether any of them were dual citizens as at August 17, 2015. “When applying for a passport, the applicant has to mention whether he is a dual citizen. The MPs’ passport and identity card numbers could be obtained from Parliament,” Gammanpila said. We shall refrain from naming these MPs for legal reasons, except for MP Basil Rajapaksa who himself admitted his US citizenship and vowed not to renounce it. Speaking to the BCC Sinhala Service, Rajapaksa said he had “nothing to hide” about his citizenship of the US, where his wife and children are domiciled.
The reduction of the security accorded to former Prsident Mahinda Rajapaksa was another hot political topic. The JO has protested this move, saying it could pose a threat to the life of the former President. However, Law and Order Minister Sagala Ratnayake has countered saying that even after the reduction, the former President would be having more than 180 security personnel drawn from the Police and STF. Former President Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga too entered the debate, saying it was Rajapaksa himself who ordered the pruning down of security of ex-Presidents. In any case, the Government said security details are periodically assessed in line with security concerns and could either be bolstered or reduced depending on the requirements.
The much-talked about Cabinet reshuffle may not happen as none of the UNP Ministers was willing to take over another portfolio. The feeling was mutual on the SLFP side. Prime Minister Wickremesinghe has assured UNP ministers’ portfolios will not be changed. According to the 19th Amendment to the Constitution, it is discretionary for the President to consult the Prime Minister in the appointment of Cabinet Ministers and assignment of subjects. However, the Government must be mindful about the fact that the public has a rather negative view of certain ministers from both sides and a mid-term refresh may do no harm.
SLFP faction of the National Unity government
Last week, both President Sirisena and Prime Minister Wickremesinghe found time to talk with their respective ministers and other close associates. The President had a long discussion with his loyalists on Monday night to discuss the issues facing the Unity Government. The discussion lasted for hours and the ministers who participated in the discussion were tight lipped. However it appears that they discussed the Rajitha Senaratne-John Seneviratne issue and many other developments that had manifestly disturbed the SLFP faction of the National Unity government. Several ministers had apparently demanded the sacking of Senaratne from the Cabinet over his remarks against Seneviratne and other SLFP figures, but they have to keep in mind that Senaratne was one of the key architects of the Rainbow Coalition that brought President Sirisena to power. Senaratne and his son Chathura are however known to make controversial statements from time to time.
The UNP too had a soul-searching session that went late into the night. With two elections on the cards this year alone, the Grand Old Party of local politics cannot afford to be complacent. In the wake of political challenges, the UNP working committee has decided to appoint three committees to look into the party’s future. These committees will be headed by Mangala Samaraweera, Ajith P Perera and Akila Viraj Kariyawasam. Samaraweera will head the committee on communications, Perera will be in charge of the committee on elections and Kariyawasam will handle the committee on grassroots level organisation of the party.
The committee headed by Samaraweera will also include Harin Fernando and Harsha De Silva, who is incidentally Samaraweera’s deputy at the Foreign Ministry. The committee in charge of elections will include Sajith Premadasa, Ravi Karunanayake, Lakshman Kiriella and Vajira Abeywardene.
The working committee also discussed the possibility of starting a publicity campaign based mostly on social media. Prime Minister Wickremesinghe also thanked all UNP organisers for the massive crowd that thronged its May Day rally.
President Sirisena was one of the first leaders to congratulate newly-elected French President Emmanuel Macron on Monday morning. Although a direct comparison may not be wise, ethno-nationalist movements worldwide that were riding high in recent times have come crashing down to earth after nationalist and isolationist Marine Le Pen’s huge defeat on Sunday. It suggests that at least for the time being, voters prefer globalism rather than isolationism.
This is a lesson for extremist parties in Sri Lanka and the region, which thrive by driving fear into people’s heart. France has marked the defeat of fear and the triumph of hope, which is what we all need at this hour.
