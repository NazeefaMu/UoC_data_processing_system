Explaining his vision for Apple in Sri Lanka, Dr. Prasantha Jayamanna, the outspoken Chairman/CEO of DPJ Holdings, the holding company for tabZ said, "Apple products no longer cater only to high profile CEOs and top management executives.
It is now an affordable device that a middle class family could use and experience the productivity and day-to-day ease it brings to our lives. From effectively managing your work, to sharing information with your friends, to using it as a source of entertainment, Apple is now a lifestyle brand that you can use from the start of your day to its end."
Schools, universities and other educational institutions can also use these products as a learning tool. Given the manner in which prices are reducing, it will soon be possible for each classroom to be equipped with tablets. In an attempt to make this a reality, tabZ has already started working with banks and other lending institutions to assist schools.
This is the vision Dr. Jayamanna hopes to see realized for Apple in Sri Lanka. Himself a visionary and one of the most dynamic young entrepreneurs in Sri Lanka, he has won both the Provincial and National Award for 'Sri Lankan Entrepreneur of the Year' every year from 2008 to 2014 and was adjudged 'The Outstanding Young Person of the Year (TOYP) in 2009.
His company DPJ Holdings has won the 'COYLE National Award for Outstanding Performance' from 2010 to 2012, the 'National Business Excellence Award 2010 - ICT Service Sector and the 'CNCI Achievers Awards 2012 - Service Sector'.
