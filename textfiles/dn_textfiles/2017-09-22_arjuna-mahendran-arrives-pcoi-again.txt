Arjuna Mahendran arrives before PCoI, again

 
Former Central Bank Governor Arjuna Mahendran arrived at the Presidential Commission of Inquiry (PCoI) probing in to the Treasury Bond issue for the third time, today.
He was summoned by the PCoI to record a statement on the 27 February 2015 auction as well as the 29, 31 March 2016 auctions, which are under the scrutiny of the Commission.
At the previous summon Arjuna Mahendran accepted that he was in full agreement with the Tender Board decision taken on the 27 February 2015 auction to accept 10.5 billion bids and disagreed with the Auditor General’s position that a loss was incurred by the government at the said auction.
He also said that he was not involved in the decision-making processes of 29 and 31 March 2016 auctions.
