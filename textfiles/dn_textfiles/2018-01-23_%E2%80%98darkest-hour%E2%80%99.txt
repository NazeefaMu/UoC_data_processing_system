‘Darkest Hour’

There are transformations and then there is Gary Oldman’s Churchill in Joe Wright’s Darkest Hour. The actor endured five hours in the makeup chair daily to transform into the rotund politician who rescued Britain from WWII. With the semi-retired makeup legend Kazuhiro Tsuji behind the making of the mask, Oldman worked intimately to disappear into the role. On set, nobody met Gary Oldman for months. And, he says, it gave him a new appreciation for the British politician who strove to bring an end to WWII.
When the news breaks that Joe Wright is doing a Churchill movie, and that he’s cast you as Churchill, it’s hard not to double-take. What was your first reaction?
I think my reaction was much the same as yours. Most of the work that I’ve done over the years, I’ve hardly ever chased. I’m at the mercy of the industry, and you’re beholden to the imaginations of the people that are casting the roles. A Churchill project came my way in 2014, and my reaction was, “Don’t be utterly ridiculous.” It was never in my consciousness, even. You could see yourself playing Lear, maybe, down the road. Lear can be different things to different people. But when you start with the robust silhouette of a man like Churchill, with the big jowls and the double chin, it’s hard to see that.
