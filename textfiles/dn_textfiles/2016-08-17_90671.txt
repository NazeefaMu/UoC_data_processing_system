SLFP Local Government Representative’s Collective to boycott National Convention

The SLFP Local Government Representative’s Collective declared that they would boycott the SLFP National Convention scheduled to be held in Kurunegala.
They also stated that whilst they would continue to be members of the SLFP, the single minded decisions taken by the President and General Secretary of the party had forced them to take such a stance. They also requested that all SLFP MPs of the Joint Opposition too refrain from attending the convention.
The collective which is made up of former chairmen and members of Local Governments in Kantale, Trincomalee, Seruwavila and Polonnaruwa held their media briefing yesterday at former President Mahinda Rajapaksa’s office at Battramulla.
They also said that they would take steps to stand against the injustice meted out by the party leaders against party members. They pointed out that the leadership had chosen to enter into an agreement with the UNP for the next five years without having consulted party members or the party's Central Committee. The Collective stressed that the true members of the party were opposed to this.
The Collective also opined that the SLFP ministers in government were acting in accordance with the wishes of the UNP, and they (Collective) did not accept the authority of the incumbent General Secretary and that President Sirisena would go down in history as a leader who insulted the party and betrayed it to the UNP.
They also praised the actions of former President Mahinda Rajapaksa who they acknowledged to be a leader who won the war and never betrayed the party.
They stressed that Rajapaksa had always been a strength to the party and that they would continue to support him.
The Collective also added that if the supporters were fed up with the incumbent leadership of the party, there was no point in them participating in the upcoming Convention.
