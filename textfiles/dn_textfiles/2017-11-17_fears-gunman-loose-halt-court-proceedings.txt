Fears of gunman on the loose halt Court proceedings

The Magistrate’s Court and the District Court in Matara had to stop work for one and half hours due to a telephone call received by the police emergency unit 119, in the wee hours of November 15. The caller had reported of a person with a firearm was in the Courts premises with the intention of committing an offence.
However, after receiving the information, the police had taken steps to search all persons at the premises at that time.
It was further divulged that the police had not been able to find any firearm from anyone’s possession. However, they had found a nut cracker (Giraya) in the hip of an elderly person, which was using for cracking arecanuts. When the police search was over, the judges recommenced sessions at about 11.30 am.
