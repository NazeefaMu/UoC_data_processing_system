Six Indian cricketers with Engineering Degree who have excelled in sports

Looking at their talents, skills and achievements in their profession, sometimes we tend to think sports persons are only good at what they do or where they are in and bad in other things.
We think they only play sports and don’t do other things in life. But they are not.
Besides pursuing their passion and excelling in the sports they are in, there are many who are also quite good and excellent in other fields as well.
There are many who are quite good in studies and have done excellently well academically and even hold high degrees. In this post, we take a look at some of the Indian cricketers who hold an engineering degree and have still excelled at the sports at the highest level.
1. ANIL KUMBLE
Former team India captain, Anil Kumble is easily the most famous engineer turned cricketer. With 619 test and 337 ODI wickets, he is the highest wicket-taker for India in both the formats.
He was India’s main strike bowler for most of his career, which spans almost two decades, and has been foxing the batsmen across the world.
Kumble completed his schooling from National College Basavanagudi. He has a BE degree in Mechanical Engineering from Rashtreeya Vidyalaya College of Engineering (RVCE), Bangalore. He got his degree in 1991-92 and also made his ODI debut around the same time.
2. JAVAGAL SRINATH
Although, Javagal Srinath made great strides as a cricketer and then later as a match referee, he feels that education is also important in the grooming of sportspersons.
He is arguably one of India’s best fast bowlers. Srinath holds a BE degree in Instrumentation Technology from Sri Jayachamarajendra College of Engineering, Mysuru.
3. RAVICHANDRAN ASHWIN
Ravichandran Ashwin is currently India’s leading bowler across different formats. The way in which he approaches cricket has more often than not left the experts to make conclusions about his solid background and upbringing.
Ashwin has a B.Tech degree in Information Technology from SSN College of Engineering, Chennai. In fact, like most of the engineers of his generation, he joined a software company post-graduation.
4. KRISHNAMACHARI SRIKANTH
Krishnamchari Srikanth is another cricketer who holds an engineering degree. Srikanth is an Electrical Engineer from College of Engineering, Guindy in Chennai. Although he used to play cricket at different levels during his engineering days, but it was only during his fourth year of college that he thought he could become a test cricketer.
5. SRINIVASARAGHAVAN VENKATARAGHAVAN
Srinivasaraghavan Venkataraghvan’s statistics of 156 wickets from 57 matches may not seem very impressive, but he was undoubtedly one of the best spinners to have represented India. Post-retirement Venkataraghavan took up umpiring and was a member of the ICC’s elite panel of umpires for a long time.
Venkataraghavan is a qualified engineer from College of Engineering, Guindy in Chennai. He is an all-rounder in true sense - great player, respected umpire and an engineer by qualification.
6. ERAPALLI PRASANNA
E.A.S Prasanna was probably one of the first among the engineers to make an impact on the cricket field. The former off-spinner holds an engineering degree from the National Institute of Engineering, Mysuru. Along with BS Chandrashekhar, S Venkataraghavan and Bishen Singh Bedi, he formed a quartet of spinners in the Indian team in the 1960s and 1970s.
Great cricketers they are, all!
