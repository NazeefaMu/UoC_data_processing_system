‘Seventy five per cent of sands mined from rivers transported without permits’

 
Seventy five per cent of sands mined from rivers are transported to different areas in the country without permits and this situation should be arrested soon, Environment Deputy Minister Anuradha Jayaratne said.
He said that only 25 persons engaged in transporting sands obtain proper permits from the authorities.
Jayaratne said that people’s support is needed to protect the environment.
“I have already given instructions to Ministry officials take prompt action against those involved in destroying the environment,” he said. Jayaratne said that the environment is not protected merely because the President is holding the Ministry. The support of government servants and the public is required for the protection of environment.
