Annona, the Aristocrat of fruits

Mark Twain called the cherimoya (Annona Cherimola) "the most delicious fruit known to men!" The Sweetsop/Sugar apple (Annona Squamosa) is called the "Aristocrat of fruits". Garden Talk spoke to Director, Institute of Indigenous Medicine, Swarna Hapuarachchi on Annona, genus of the family, Annonaceae that contains absolutely mouthwatering fruits.
From the 166 species, Hapuarachchi elaborated at great length on 7-
• Cherimoya (Annona Cherimola)
• Pawpaw (Asimina)
• Soursop (Annona Muricata)
• Sugar Apple/ sweetsop (Annona Squamosa)
• The Atemoya is a cross of Cherimoya (Annona Cherimola) and Sweetsop/ sugar apple (Annona Squamosa)
• Ilama (Annona Diversifolia)
• Custard Apple (Annona Reticulata)
"Cherimoya (Annona Cherimola) is a tree that produces white fleshed custard like fruit that is sweet and delicious. The creamy texture of the flesh gives the fruit its secondary name, custard apple. A name it shares with Annona Reticulata. Cherimoya is a small-sized fruit with mosaic patterns on the skin surface. The fruit is also known as the "tree of ice cream," owing to its creamy consistency. The fruit is commonly used in smoothies, ice creams, pie fillings and mousse," said Hapuarachchi.
Custard Apple (Annona Reticulata) is a fruit, where the shape varies considerably from round to heart shaped and even oblong. The flavour is sweet but not as delicious as its relatives.
"Annona squamosa (Sweetsop/ Sugar Apple) is rich in medicinally and industrially important bio-active components present in all its parts. The fruit is known for its nutritional value. It is a large deciduous shrub or small tree about four to eight meters tall. Leaves are simple, oblong and elliptic. The flowers are fragrant, creamy yellow to greenish, seen solitary or in groups of up to four. The fruit is globose, yellowish green when ripe, embossed with prominent scales with soft creamy pulp. Seeds are hard, brownish black and smooth in texture," stated Hapuarachchi.
Soursop (Annona Muricata) is a tree that averages about 20 feet in height. The fruit is the largest of the annonas and can weigh more than 5 pounds.
"The fruit is considered to be one of the finest for making sherbet because of its delicious flavor. Some people describe the flavor as a blend of pineapple and mango. This tree is propagated by seed and occasionally grafted varieties are available. It is known as Katu Anoda in Sri Lanka. It is a broadleaf, flowering, evergreen tree. It is native to the tropical regions of the Americas and is widely propagated," pointed out Hapuarachchi.
If you take the Annona Diversifolia (e lama), the flavor of this amazing fruit is unique - sweet with a rich complex flavor. You probably won't see many of these trees for one main reason. Even as great tasting as it is, the fruit has one major drawback - the fruit splits on the tree when ready to eat. "Atemoya is a tree that produces grayish red colored fruits that are sweet and delicious! Atemoya is described as hyper- productive and will set fruit quiet heavily. Leave fruit at the base of branches. Fruit growing at the base of branches will taste better and be less likely to cause limb breakage. Most nurseries that graft trees, generally graft onto Sugar Apple or Custard Apple. Grafting onto Cherimoya produces a superior tree," added Hapuarachchi. Among the Annona (spp.) male and female flowers bloom on the same tree at different stages of sexual maturity.
"Insects handle the pollination. When hand pollination is practised the pollen is moved from one flower to another by a person. Female flowers are generally most receptive early in the morning or when humidity is high."
It is commonly agreed that fruit will be larger and better shaped with complete pollination by either human or insect intervention. Cross pollination is the ideal situation for highest fruit productivity and fruit size.
"The flesh of the Annona Muricata fruit consists of an edible, white pulp, some fiber, and a core of indigestible, black seeds. The species is the only member of its genus suitable for processing and preservation. The pulp is also used to make fruit nectar, smoothies, fruit juice drinks, as well as candies, sorbets, and ice cream flavorings," she added. In Mexico, Colombia, Venezuela, and Harar (Ethiopia), it is a common fruit, often used for dessert as the only ingredient. In Colombia and Venezuela, it is a fruit for juices, mixed with milk. In Cuba, a thick smoothie made of soursop pulp, milk and cane sugar goes by the name of champola. Ice cream and fruit bars made of soursop are also very popular. The seeds are normally left in the preparation and removed while consuming, unless a blender is used for processing.
"In Indonesia, a sweetmeat is made by boiling soursop pulp in water and adding sugar until the mixture hardens. Soursop is also a common ingredient for making fresh fruit juices that are sold by street food vendors. In the Philippines, it is called guyabano, and is eaten ripe, or used to make juices, smoothies, or ice cream. Sometimes, the leaf is used to tenderiz meat," clarified Hapuarachchi.
Health Benefits of Cherimoya
• Vitamin C:
A single, medium-sized cherimoya fruit contains 30 milligrams of Vitamin C, providing about 35% of the daily recommended intake. Vitamin C in cherimoya is required for the healing of wounds and formation of cartilage, tendons and ligaments. Consumption of one cup of cherimoya daily develops resistance against infectious agents and scavenges harmful free radicals from the body.
• Cardiovascular health:
Vitamin C in cherimoya prevents free radicals from attacking the lipids, thus promoting cardiovascular health. It reduces bad cholesterol (LDL) and increases good cholesterol (HDL) levels in the blood. This improves the blood flow in the heart, reducing the risk of heart attacks. A well-balanced sodium and potassium ratio in cherimoya regulates the heart rate and blood pressure. It also counteracts the bad influence of sodium. Fiber in cherimoya prevents the absorption of cholesterol in the gut.
• Vitamin B6:
Vitamin B6 in cherimoya is required for the proper functioning of our metabolism and immune system. It regulates GABA neuron chemical levels to help get rid of stress and depression. Vitamin B6 also protects from Parkinson's disease.
• Fiber:
One medium cherimoya provides 5 grams of dietary fiber, amounting to about 90% of the recommended amount. Fiber is essential for keeping the digestive tract healthy and lowering the blood sugar levels. It also adds bulk to the stool, relieving constipation.
• Cancer:
Cherimoya for cancer is proved to be very beneficial. It acts against cancer cells, without adversely affecting healthy cells. The leaves and stems of cherimoya contain acetogenic, which helps in the treatment of cancer. It interferes with the action of enzymes, preventing cancer development. The high amounts of fiber in cherimoya protect the mucous membrane of the colon from exposure to toxic substances by binding cancer-causing chemicals in the colon. It also contains potent antioxidants like asimicin and bullatacin, which are found to have anti-cancer and anti-helminthes properties.
• Antioxidants:
Cherimoya contains several polyphenol antioxidants, which limit damage caused to the cells by free radicals. The flesh, juice and peel, all have decent amounts of antioxidants in them.
• Maintains Health of the Skin:
Cherimoya fruit has a high content of Vitamin C, which is vital for maintaining the health of the skin. Vitamin C helps in the formation of collagen, a protein, which provides elasticity to the skin. Vitamin C also helps to combat free radicals in the body, providing healthy and flawless skin.
• Promotes Hair Growth:
Cherimoya is a highly nutritious fruit, which can benefit the hair in numerous ways. It contains hair-friendly nutrients like magnesium, zinc iron and Vitamin C, which promote hair growth.
• Treats Hair Lice and Nits:
Unripe cherimoya fruit powder can help you to get rid of hair lice. Mix the powder with water and apply it on the scalp, one hour before shampooing to treat hair lice and nits.
• Turns Hair Lustrous and Shiny:
Cherimoya seed oil is ideal for wavy and coarse hair. It hydrates the scalp to make the hair lustrous, shiny and manageable.
