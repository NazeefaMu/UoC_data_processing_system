Hope in reform

In the nineteenth century especially as knowledge and understanding continued to advance and develop, people have been driven and impelled to move more vigorously to search for truth and meaning of life and it has been accompanied by a thirst for justice, freedom, equality and peace. Thus human beings continue to search anew for the meaning and purpose of life, each one making of it a personal growing and learning process and discovery.
Religious communities help in this learning process. Though religion, mainly among which are world religions, may be the source that sheds light on the issues that human beings and human communities face, there are many issues of life and many ideologies and points of view from the political, economic, financial, demographic, cultural and philosophical world, that continually call for man’s attention. World religions which cannot be self-centred, connects the individual to others. Which of the world religions connect people to all humanity?
With the passing of time, in decades and centuries, the adherents of religions have tended to stray from the pristine path and even add to the original message due to inorganic developments and various contingencies, cultural elements inconsonant to and foreign to its spirit. Therefore, there comes a time for recovery, revival and reform, by going back to the roots, the original spring, the unmixed teaching, bringing about an improvement thus revitalising anew the lives of adherents more consistently.
Reform comes when there are wrongs to be corrected when what ought to be is restored. There is a process of death and rebirth in religions by which what is out of date and incompatible today is put aside and what is timely and suitable in keeping with truth and the process of enlightenment and progress, what is best for solidarity with humanity is adopted and assimilated.
On to the intellectual and spiritual growth process in the life of a mature adult, nothing can be imposed or enforced forcibly; the adult should be left free to enquire and choose for himself that which appeals to his conscience. Religions also could awaken the conscience of human beings to adhere to truth, justice and fairness, to what is honest, gracious, courteous, peaceable and good for all.
Religions could be of mutual help in this discarding of the obsolete and accepting and taking on the new, thereby opening to the light of knowledge and dispelling the darkness of ignorance, opting graciousness to hostility, cooperation to rivalry, preferring truth to error, discerning true values from false ones and embracing a spirit of service to fellowmen rather than being enclosed and isolated in self-preservation and narcissist pre-occupation. In any case, no religion should lend itself to the degeneration and destruction of any part or the whole of humanity. Rather religions together should enlighten, build, uplift, ennoble and be of service to humanity according to its capacity and not bring on ignorance, darkness, destruction and annihilation to people.
LEADERS FEEL THREATENED
While religious leaders may be attempting to summon humanity to a more enlightened and sustaining way of life, secular leaders may be directing themselves and their peoples in a tangential direction if not an opposite one. (It should also be noted that there have been occasions in history when perceptive secular leaders urged religious leaders to be true to the obligations of their calling!) While religious leaders may be engaged in confidence-building and forging bonds of friendship, simultaneously there are secular political leaders who with their nations feel threatened both from within and outside. They try to find security and trust in armaments; their manufacture, the skill and training needed to handle them, the replacement, advancement and their maintenance cost so dear that development of other fields of human activity are underrated or neglected and whole segments of the population are unjustly left poor with their basic means of livelihood uncared for. This is quite in contrast to the teachings of the main world religions which of course they ignore.
FUNDAMENTAL OPTION
While some find life a riddle or a puzzle difficult to solve, some others find it meaningless and absurd. There are also those who, even without thinking about it deeply enough, presume life should be lived, protected, taken care of and they wish to enjoy life as long as it lasts.
In the world of today with rapidly accessible global communications, the presence of a variety of religions make themselves felt and call for our attention. There is almost a half of humanity who have no enlightenment from a religion while the other half has found a clarifying light falling on life from a religious teaching they have inherited or from a tradition that has been there. Most of them may not have intently searched or investigated what they have inherited from family background and community tradition into which they were born. Yet most have without question or with little questioning accepted what they have inherited. Only a few reject outright what they inherit and make a fundamental option or a choice of their own after examining also the assertions and claims of other persuasions.
FREEDOM FOR UNBELIEF
It is indeed very reasonable to let everyone be free even though there are persons and groups, in some religious traditions also in Sri Lanka, who resent any individual, personal search and choice. This resentment in some religious communities even becomes an ostracism and exclusion from the community or even death for ‘apostasy’ or ‘infidelity’. However such drastic reactions are contrary to the laws of civilised nations and are also in opposition to the charter of human rights of the United Nations and are frowned upon by educated people.
In any case, the search for truth in religious belief should be in keeping with man’s inherent human dignity of which he becomes conscious as he grows and matures and when he assesses himself with all that is found in the world into which he is born. Vetoing such freedom to search for truth or questioning for clarification and elucidation in probing for truth, are not in keeping with human dignity, freedom and autonomy. Acceptance and embracing of a system of belief or non-acceptance and rejection of such a system or any belief are within a human being’s right and all need to respect it.
SHARING, MUTUAL ENRICHMENT
For any religion to be of significance to all humanity on this earthly home, the teachings, norms, services and traditions of religions should be of relevance to human beings and be possible of universal application. On the part of adherents of religions, there should be a devotion to truth, to freedom, to justice, human solidarity and peace. And overcoming of envy, jealousy, hatred, revenge, wickedness, violent rivalry and cruelty are considered concomitant with religious adherence and doctrines of most religions. There is also the desire for mutual acquaintance with others and a desire to give and receive love on a footing of equality. Religions also hold out a hopeful vision of realities beyond sense experience, that is to be had in an existence beyond the present life. Hope is the substance of things unseen.
Before religious leaders sit down for inter-religious dialogue and fraternal discussion, for the sake of inter-community harmony and world peace, they should recover from the resources of their religions those riches of serenity, tranquillity, peace and sharing that they can share with others for mutual enrichment. It is only then that they would be able to share their common sentiments and particular beliefs with all.
JOY IN REALITIES BEYOND
Religion means that people could be persuaded by reason and the attraction and the force of the truth of what is presented. And all these could be promoted to be spontaneously accepted or accepted after serious consideration without subjecting anyone to any kind of compulsion against one’s will. Religions by their nature should be raising and leading people to a higher level and quality of liberty, of thinking and living. Religion is to help human beings to be integrated within oneself free of interior or exterior fault or blemish.
Religions should be sources of promise and hope and not distrust and despair.
Religions ennoble human beings and bring about good order in their community life and do not lead them to confusion, perversity, degeneration and anarchical conduct. Religions cannot be preserved and promoted by means and forces opposed to the assumptions and notions of behaviour respectful of the dignity and rights of human beings. Religions that hold out a vision of a glorious liberation, joy in realities yet unseen, beyond sense experience also need to present a tangible belief and a felt pledge of what is to come.
It is challenging for religious leaders to exercise only persuasion and the force of truth and reason and the strong witness of one’s life to uphold, maintain and promote one’s religion and leave people free to accept or reject what is proposed.
POLITICAL DESPOTS
Totalitarian governments force people under their control in many ways to adopt atheism as a belief in contravention of the principles of democracy and the United Nations charter of human rights which is an acknowledgement of the dignity and rights of human beings that have been there in human society from time immemorial. Leaders of such autocratic governments who have not investigated the basic questions of life are insecure and lack the confidence to face fundamental questions that human beings need to face. Atheistic political despots cannot face the challenges of the truth, freedom, equality and justice in their depth and ramifications affecting human life. They resort to harassment and aggression to intimidate those who stand up for human dignity, human rights, democracy and justice turning their Courts of Law to kangaroo courts of summary justice which are courts of injustice.
Religious leaders of various world religions should stand together in solidarity to oppose illegal and anti-social measures of undemocratic despotic totalitarian governments who have usurped democracy and the rights of people in the name of a socialist liberation which has turned out to be mass imprisonment and a captivity within national and ideological boundaries.
EARTH - A BETTER HOME
In the face of such eventualities it is challenging for religious leaders to keep to high levels of human dignity, human rights, autonomy, freedom and justice and exercise only persuasion and the force of truth and reason, altruistic human solidarity, compassion and love to uphold, maintain and promote one’s religion and leave people free to accept or reject what is proposed. Others’ criticism of our religion from their point of view could be helpful in self-criticism and presenting to others a better awareness of our understanding of our religion and its principles.
It also needs to be asked as to what extent the revival, reform and inter-religious dialogue would have furthered mutual understanding, raised the level of fraternity among people and improved their lives, especially in its humanitarian and spiritual dimensions and promoted and stabilized peace and made the earth a better home for all to live in. To the extent that is achieved, to that extent the religions would have contributed a worthy and dutiful share of their own.
