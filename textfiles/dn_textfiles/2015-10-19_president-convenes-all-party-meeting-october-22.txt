President Maithripala Sirisena convened an all party meeting on October 22 to discuss about the war crimes inquiry mechanism.
Invitations for the all party meeting have already been sent out to all political parties, irrespective of their presence in Parliament.
At the all party meeting, political parties will express their views on forming a war crimes inquiry mechanism with the participation of international stakeholders.
The large majority of opposition parties too have decided to take part in the all party meeting convened by the President, highly placed political sources said.
They further added that the government's course of action with regard to the domestic inquiry mechanism will be based on the outcome of the all party meeting.
The President is also expected to hold a meeting with religious leaders to obtain their views on the war crimes inquiry mechanism.
