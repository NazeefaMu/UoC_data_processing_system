Karunaratne warms up for Test with a ton

LEICESTER: Dimuth Karunaratne the Sri Lankan left-handed opener warmed up for the first Test against England on Thursday with a timely century in Sri Lanka’s three-day match against Leicestershire which ended in a draw at Grace Road on Sunday.
Karunaratne hit a pleasing century off 134 balls with 15 fours before retiring out.
His knock formed the basis of Sri Lanka’s second innings total of 200 for four wickets when the match was called off in mutual consent between the two captains.
Karunaratne and his opening partner Kaushal Silva shared an opening stand of exactly 100 when Sri Lanka commenced their second innings after Leicestershire had declared at 375-5.
Silva followed his first innings knock of 38 with solid 43 and the Lankan would also have been pleased with the form of Lahiru Thirimanne who was unbeaten on 40 out of a second wicket stand of 79 with Karunaratne.
In the first innings uncapped Dasun Shanaka hit the tourists first century of the tour with an exciting 112 off 132 balls.
This is Sri Lanka’s final warm-up game before they take on England in a series of three Tests.
