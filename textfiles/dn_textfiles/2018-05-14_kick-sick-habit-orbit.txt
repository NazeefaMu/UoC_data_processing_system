Kick that sick habit into orbit!

Kicking bad habits can be extremely hard to do. The effort involves patience and time. In many instances change in certain mundane behavioural patterns are much appreciated particularly in the workplace. In the case of other infuriating habits it is vital that change be effected almost overnight in your own interest and the interest of those around you.
Be aware that there have been employees who have been kicked out of office for being unable to remedy certain disgustingly offensive habits. Workplace etiquette does not essentially exist because of social propriety. Rather, a business has a financial incentive in making sure that a workplace minds its manners and that management and co-workers are polite and show consideration and respect to one another.
That is because it is not always easy to interrelate with the people who you work with. There are factors that could make it difficult to have a successful relationship which could affect the morale of the entire organisation. There are always those who are bound to exasperate you with their idiosyncratic tendencies.
People are sometimes so set in their ways that they don’t realise they are being irritable to their colleagues. At times it is just our personality and environment that dictate our behaviour. Certainly, old habits die hard. But it is never too late to teach an old dog new tricks!
Accepting the reasons to change can be an eye-opening experience. No office environment is perfect. And it is not always easy to pigeonhole what may be excessively aggravating conduct in the office. It is easy to point fingers at the lapses of others but take a little time to reflect on your own frailties. It is always advisable to have a sense of awareness of the sensitivities of your co-workers and to be able to read their body language and what they detest.
You may not realise it, but there is always the startling prospect that you may be a perpetrator. Possibly you may be the person responsible for certain frustrations that drive your colleagues up the wall. Working in close quarters with other people always calls for thoughtfulness and adjustment.
But if you are a constant source of disruption and distraction then you are sure to have those around you on an uneasy footing. Such behaviour is certain to cause exasperation and erode camaraderie. Objectionable behaviour such as texting in meetings, spreading malicious rumours, taking credit for other people’s work, ignoring emails and even refusing to say a simple ‘please’ and ‘thank you’ are much more than just annoyances.
Stress caused by bad behaviour could be costing businesses staggering losses by affecting the performance of those on the receiving end. Civility costs nothing, but implementing a culture of consideration in the workplace could result in real paybacks in terms of productivity and bottom line profits.
Then there is always the embarrassing hygiene factor. Remember that an air-conditioned office is an enclosed space with re-circulated air. So a stinkpot with foul body odour can make working life a terrible torture for surrounding colleagues. It can permeate the entire office and just sets a bad tone for the entire working day.
So it would always be advisable to bathe before a working day with a liberal lathering of soap. A self-preservative such as a deodorant would be wise to use for good measure. Breath mints too come in pretty handy at times because you will be talking to your co-workers at point blank whiffing range.
In tropical Sri Lanka we are taught from an early age that, left to our own devices, we smell bad. And, well, we sort of do unless we bathe as frequently as is even considered unnecessary by some just to be sure we come out smelling like roses. Fragrances can add to the pleasure and make you reek of the sweet smell of success.
But as mentioned earlier use soap and water substantially to bathe in rather than bathe in perfumes or after shaves.
Being branded the office gossip is not the dubious reputation anyone would relish being conferred with. Then why the heck do you do it? It is possibly because you attempt to take the spotlight off your own blemishes by exposing those of others. So a person who gossips by habit does not truly believe he or she is good enough to stand on their own merits.
One of the most effective methods to kick the distasteful habit of rumour-mongering would be to redirect your conversation on sharing your personal experiences, such as your latest vacation, music trends or sports activities.
This will give you something else to discuss besides other people’s divorces or other such scandals.
Besides, you never know whether your tittle-tattle chit-chat would be conveyed to the target of your defamatory action. Keep in mind that gossiping makes you untrustworthy and even treacherous. You may even lose friends and professional contacts when people realise you are a gossip.
Then we mistakenly think we are a cut above the rest by talking down to others. We refuse to listen to reason. Many of us never say ‘please’ or ‘thank you.’ We show up late or leave a meeting early with no explanation. We belittle others’ efforts while withholding information and leaving a mess for others to clean up.
But there are other dangers to be considered as well.
The line between crude humour and sexual harassment is often very thin. Sometimes, jokes that are meant as humour can offend employees and make them feel unsafe or humiliated. Worse still are the ‘touchy-feely’ types who simply can’t keep their hands to themselves.
For one thing remember your co-workers are not necessarily your friends and even those who are may not enjoy being touched.
For this reason, it is better for a workplace to remain polite and professional. Managers should restrict employees from engaging in puerile questionable activities, touching colleagues, crude jokes or offensive language particularly in the presence of the opposite sex. In that way you can cut down on the chance that the company will be the object of a lawsuit by a harassed employee.
