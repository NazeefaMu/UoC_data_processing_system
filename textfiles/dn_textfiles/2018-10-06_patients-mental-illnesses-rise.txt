Patients with mental illnesses on the rise

The number of Sri Lankans suffering from depression will significantly increase by 2030, Mental Health Unit Director Dr. Chithramali de Silva said.
She was addressing a health seminar at the Health Promotion Bureau in Colombo to mark the World Mental Health Day on October 10. She said at present, 20 percent of the young generation suffers from some sort of mental problem.
Depression has become a common mental problem among children. Children commit suicide due to depression. The third cause for deaths among children between 15 and 19 years is suicide.
Dr. de Silva said a total of 19 percent of the children suffer from loneliness. Six percent of the children suffer due to not having a good friend. Children’s brain develops until they reach 25 years and until then they cannot make wise decisions.
Using electronic gadgets from childhood is one of the main reasons for developing mental problems among children. Parents should pay special attention if children below 17 years prefer to be alone, she said.
“Unhealthy lifestyles and education system of children should change. If a child suffers from a headache for a long time, muscle pain, sleeplessness, loss of appetite, lack of enthusiasm to attend school etc., parents should take immediate action to obtain treatment for their children,” she added.
