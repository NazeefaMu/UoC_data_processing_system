SLFP calls for proper audit on bond issue

A proper audit of the Bond issue is needed to find out how much was lost, SLFP national organiser and Science, Technology and Research Minister Susil Premajayantha said yesterday.
“Perpetual Treasuries which began with a capital of Rs. 300 million in 2014, by 2015 April earned a profit of  Rs 10100.6 million. How did this happen?”, he asked.
The Minister also insisted that the Presidential Commission to investigate into the bond scam was not a delaying tactic but a measure to speed up action against those accused.
“The COPE report cannot be used as evidence in courts. It has to be directed to the Attorney General and then it has to be directed to the CID or police to conduct fresh investigations to record evidence. But we all know, given the experience of the last two years, many cases with the police don’t see the light of day”,Premajayantha said at a media conference at the SLFP headquarters.
He added that a Presidential Commission which wielded a wider mandate could conduct investigations faster and more accurately, “The findings of the Commission can be used as evidence in a court of law. This makes it easier for the police to prosecute. This is helpful because at times the Police or even the Bribery Commission may not have the technical know how to conduct such complex financial investigations”, said the minister.
The Commission is to submit its report in three months.
The Commission is one of the recommendations made by the SLFP Central Committee and according to Premajayantha and SLFP Media Spokesperson Dilan Perera, a necessary one, given the conduct of the IGP in recent times, “The President noticed that the IGP was preparing to file the case as a civil case and not a criminal one. The Commission on the other hand will look into how both can be done”, said Perera.
“The IGP needs to do his job. Many were of the belief that with independent commissions appointing heads, things will change, but that has not happened. We need to change the way the system works”, added Premajayantha.
Perera explained that they have ensured that no one could now find an excuse to postpone prosecution. Parliament on Tuesday held an adjournment debate on the bond scam and Premajayantha speaking in Parliament alleged that since the first bond issue on 27 February 2017, it had occurred seven times.
