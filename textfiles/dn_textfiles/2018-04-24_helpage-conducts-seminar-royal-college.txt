HelpAge conducts seminar at Royal College

HelpAge Sri Lanka (HASL) conducted a seminar on caring for elders, at Royal College, Colombo, recently. The event was held under the theme Caring for Elders and Creating an Environment for Them to Live with Dignity.Over 800 Royal College students expressed their gratitude to HASL for educating them on the topic. Royal College Principal B. A. Abeyratne said that schoolchildren should know the value of elders who had sacrificed much in order to build the country.
HelpAge Youth Education Programme Director G. C. Mendis addressed the importance of caring for elders and said children should realise that one day, they would also grow old and not want to be left at an Elders' Home.
HASL Executive Director Samantha Liyanawaduge said statistics had revealed that 99 percent elders in Sri Lanka, are living with their families and not in Elders' Homes.
The event was sponsored by Edna Chairman Lal Edirisinghe.
