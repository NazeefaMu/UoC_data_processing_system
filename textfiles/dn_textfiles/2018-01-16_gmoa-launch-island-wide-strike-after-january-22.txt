GMOA to launch island-wide strike after January 22

The Government Medical Officers' Association (GMOA) would launch an island-wide strike at any time after January 22, GMOA Secretary Dr. Haritha Aluthge said.
Addressing a press conference held at the GMOA Headquarters in Colombo, yesterday, he said that the strike would be launched without prior notice. The President and the Health Ministry have already been informed about the trade union action to be taken by the GMOA.
According to Dr. Aluthge, responsibilities for all the hardships to be undergone by the public due to GMOA's strike should be taken by the politicians who lied and cheated people and the health officials who try to take revenge from doctors.
The GMOA has given nine demands to the government and the Health Ministry. Keeping the promises made by the government in connection with solving the SAITM issue by abolishing it on December 31, 2017, and issues related to salary and allowances were among them, he added.
