Contempt of Court action fixed against Deputy Minister Ranjan Ramanayake

A contempt of Court action against Deputy Minister Ranjan Ramanayake for allegedly making an insulting attack on the reputation of the judiciary and lawyers at a press conference on August 21, was fixed for October 12 by Supreme Court, yesterday.
When the contempt of Court action came up before the two-judge-bench comprising Justice Eva Wanasundara and Justice Vijith Malalgoda, the Court decided to support this matter before a larger bench comprising more than two-judges.
Ven. Magalkande Sudantha Thera of the Bodu Bala Sena Organization had made a complaint to the Supreme Court seeking a contempt of Court action against Deputy Minister Ranjan Ramanayake.
