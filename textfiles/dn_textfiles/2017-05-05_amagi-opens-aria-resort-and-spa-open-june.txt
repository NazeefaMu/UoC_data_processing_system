Amagi Lagoon Resort and Spa Katunayake has completed their second wing and is branded as the Aria Resort and Spa and will be completed by end June.
The new hotel also built with four star facilities offers 43 deluxe, 21 standard and 7 suites. The hotel's General Manager Elsworth Perera said Amagi Lagoon Resort and Spa was great success and the increased demand prompted them to re-invest in the new wing. “We already have good forward bookings for the property,” he added.
He said that Aria also offers a roof top restaurant with a show kitchen with an excellent view of the Negombo Lagoon. This area can accommodate 90 guests.”

He said in a bid to add more recreation facilities they have also received their Boat Safaris to the adjoining Negombo Lagoon on their Pontoon which could accommodate 25 guests. “We offer cocktails and buffet dinner and this service will be available every Friday from end May. This would be ideal getaway for Colombo office staff to spend an evening. ‘Sri Lankan Night’ on Fridays, ‘Chinese Action’ on Saturdays and Sunday Buffet Lunch are also being organised.”
He said in addition they also hope to introduce more water sportsand make their lagoon deck area even bigger. “We will also introduce an outdoor bar overlooking the lagoon by end of November.”
He said with the introduction of the new hotel and additional facilities like Spa and Gym and larger garden area today, the hotel is being converted from a transit hotel to the Airport, to a hotel where guests stay for a longer period.
Amagi Lagoon now operates with 21 rooms, 19 standard rooms with one superior room and one deluxe room, which could accommodate up to four guests. The rooms are equipped with modern facilities and amenities including hot/cold water, AC, satellite television and free Wi-Fi and many other amenities, said Group Sales and Marketing Manager, Mohamed Nairaoze.
