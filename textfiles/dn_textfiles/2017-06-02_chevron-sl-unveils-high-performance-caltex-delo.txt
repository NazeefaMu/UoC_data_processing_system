Chevron SL unveils high performance Caltex Delo

Chevron, marketer of the Caltex™ brand, unveiled its latest premium diesel engine oil, Caltex Delo®400 MGX SAE 15W-40, to address commercial business needs while meeting stringent emission regulations.
The revolutionary formulation constitutes a higher specification and is specially designed to comply with the requirements of the Sri Lankan market. It will benefit both new and old diesel engines and allow customers to utilize just one heavy-duty engine oil that operates efficiently in both high- and low- sulphur diesel fuel environments.
“The Caltex Delo®product range includes lubricants that provide the utmost protection, performance and bottom-line value for on-and off-road diesel powered equipment.Delo® branded products are used in automotives as well as in all major heavy industries such as commercial transportation, construction, agriculture and power generation” said Eenaz Salie, Marketing Manager, Chevron Sri Lanka. Thoroughly field-tested in trucks usingup to 5,000 ppm diesel fuel sulphur levels, the Caltex Delo®400 MGX has demonstrated an exceptional performance capability in neutralising harmful acids and retaining the alkalinity in extended-drain operations in both high- and low-sulphur diesel fuel environments.
Heavy industry players are grappling with challenges such as excessive occupational heat exposure and maintaining an age-diverse fleet operating in both high- and ultra-low sulphur environments. With the launch of theCaltex Delo® 400 MGX, an American Petroleum Institute (API) and American and European Original Equipment Manufacturers’ (OEM) standard compliant diesel engine oil, heavy industries can finally experience synthetic-like performance at the cost of mineral products, significantly reducing premium lubrication costs. This new advanced formula Caltex Delo® 400 MGX SAE 15W-40 delivers excellent soot dispersancy, wear protection and sludge control to guard against loss of engine life and help reduce oil consumption.
Caltex Delo® 400 MGX SAE 15W-40 has the added advantage of a single fleet oil, thereby, reducing the need for multiple diesel engine oils. The new product is specifically developed to help meet emissions regulations as well as adheres to OEM (original equipment manufacturer) requirements and performance specifications of the local markets. Delo® with ISOSYN® helps to extend service protection and maximise engine durability as well as operating costs. The newly launched Caltex Delo® 400 MGX SAE 15W-40, is currently available in 210 litre drums and in 5 litrecans, through the Caltex authorized channel partners island-wide.
