Going ‘Desi’ with street food

The Fairway Colombo street food festival in January saw Indian street food being featured in collaboration with Country Food Promotions as well as the Indo-Sri Lanka Cultural Foundation and the Indian Cultural Center representing the High Commission of India.
The presence of the High Commissioner of India to Sri Lanka Taranjit Singh Sandhu added glamour to the evening and without doubt the evening offered the authentic taste of India to the visitors.
India is naturally a food paradise with a vast variety of food and delicacies. From the Himalayan Mountains of the north to the Punjabi plains, the Goan beaches and the backwaters of Kerala, Indian cuisine is diverse in all palatable sense. The Fairway Colombo Street Food Festival captured the essence of this myriad of gastronomical experiences by bringing to the table the favourites from each state.
The Indian Street Food Festival was an exciting twist for food lovers as it presented a plethora of tantalizing dishes. Indian music set the festive mood while the traditional and modern dances added colour to the night as visitors thronged to Hospital Street.
Fairway Colombo’s many ventures including the Cultural Show, Art and Jazz on the Street, and Jam on the Street have made Hospital Street in Colombo a regular hub of entertainment attracting the locals and foreigners alike.
