History of Sri Lankan football

With the FFSL AGM around the corner it will be pertinent to recall the history of football in Sri Lanka. Few forget the glorious moments of football in the past and remember the part played by officials for the upliftment of the game. The name of Manilal Fernando should not be forgotten for his contribution to football. FFSL has a "Football House" with all the facilities, and the Baddegana grounds due to his efforts. A stadium was promised in Kandy, at Dangolla but now four years have gone and nothing has happened.
Football is the one of the most popular sports in the world today, but sad to say Sri Lankan football has taken a back seat. It is the British who introduced the game to the Americas, Europe, and Asia through their battalions, regiments and brigades. It is not possible to know exactly, when football was introduced to Sri Lanka. However, there is evidence of the game being played on the Galle Face Green, by bare chested British Servicemen stationed in and around Colombo in the 1890’s.
The service barrack grounds at Echelon Square (where the Galadari Hotel is presently situated) and the Sports Club grounds (presently the Taj Samudra Hotel) were the popular football fields in the game’s formative years. British service units such as the Royal Air Force, Royal Navy, Royal Engineers, Royal Artillery and the Royal Garrison Command were the pioneers who promoted competitive football here. British administrative service and the British planting community took the sport to the Central, Up-country and Southern regions. By early 1900 football as a competitive sport, was popular amongst the local youth. Though playing bare footed, our lads mastered the skills, and in fact, donned the Service jerseys as replacements or reserves in many an exclusively white dominated game.
The first ever attempt to organize and conduct Association Football in Ceylon was when the Colombo Association Football League was formed at a meeting held in the Bristol Hotel, Colombo on April 4, 1911. H. French was elected President with H. K. Crosskey as Secretary. However, as a result of the World War in 1914, this body understandably became inactive and ineffective.
After a lapse of nine years, the Colombo Association Football League was revived and re-constituted in 1920 under the amended name, Colombo Football League, with Herbert Dowbiggin as president and H. French as chairman. By 1924 Sir John Tarbat, that evergreen sportsman, became president and contributed immensely to the promotion of the game in the years that followed.
Southern Province - In the Southern Province, the sport had a fair impact on the masses, with the planting and administrative community leading in the promotion of the game in a big way. R. Brough, a British planter in Deniyaya, contributed much to the sport in the South between 1910 to 1920. The British servicemen from the Navy wireless station in Matara also helped to popularize the sport, particularly in the southern schools. The first football club formed in the south was the Galle Association Football Club in 1910, with obviously a predominantly British membership. R. R. Brough was its first president and the club team was captained by A. C. Blair.
Central Province - Kandy, the hill capital of Sri Lanka, had its baptism in football in the mid-1930s. During the Second World War, British units were stationed in Kandy, with the one-time Commander in Chief of the Allied Forces in the South East Asia, Admiral Lord Louis Mountbatten having his headquarters in the hill capital. Later on Kandy Amateur Football League was formed with M. S. Jainudeen as the kingpin. It subsequently changed its name to Kandy District Football Association. It served football in Matale, Gampola, Nawalapitiya, Kurunegala and Kegalle, as the years rolled by these towns formed their own associations. Today sad that football in Kandy has been allowed to go into limbo.
Northern Province - Almost at the same time the British planters, technocrats and civil servicemen were spreading the gospel of football in the Western, Central and Southern provinces. The North too, came under their spell with a flourish of football activity amongst the local populace. School leavers and young government servants were grouping together to form football clubs, so early as the mid-thirties. In fact, on 8 November 1939 to be exact, the Jaffna Football Association was formed with W. G. Spencer, District Judge, as chairman. This historic meeting took place at the Jaffna YMCA with B. E. Rajanayagam as the elected secretary. Football in the northern peninsula is as old as football in Sri Lanka, and always remained active and vibrant until the outbreak of ethnic violence in 1983.
North Central Province - Rajarata, the place of kings and palaces, and one of scenic beauty and tranquility, is also a province full of recreation and sport. Anuradhapura the ancient capital of Sri Lanka is a center of activity, both cultural and recreational and football naturally taken pride of place. The origin of football in the North Central Province is no different to that of the rest of the country. The influence of the British civil servants had been at the base of its growth. These Britishers, with the assistance of the local youth, played football more as a recreation than in competition, in a ground close to the venerated Ruwanveli Seya.
History will not be complete if appreciation is not recorded of the encouragement and assistance extended to the sport by our Heads of State such as D. S. Senanayake, Dudley Senanayake, Sir John Kotalawela, S. W. R. D. Bandaranaike, Sirimavo Bandaranaike, J. R. Jayewardene, R. Premadasa, Chandrika Kumaratunga Bandaranaike, Mahinda Rajapaksa, and the present President Mathripala Sirisena and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe who are all keen followers of the game.
The singular contribution to football by R. Premadasa needs no elaboration. The re-development of the Sugathadasa Stadium shall stand as a living monument to his unremitting devotion and sincere admiration.
