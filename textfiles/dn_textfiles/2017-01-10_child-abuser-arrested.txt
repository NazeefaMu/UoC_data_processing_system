Child abuser arrested

Neluwa police arrested a person for allegedly making a schoolgirl pregnant.
Police investigations reveal that the girl was living with her mother and had fallen in love with a labourer residing next to their house.
As her mother objected to the love affair, the girl had eloped with the suspect and returned after a few weeks. A few days later the girl had fallen sick. Following medical examination, hospital doctors had diagnosed that she was pregnant.
Neluwa police is investigating.
