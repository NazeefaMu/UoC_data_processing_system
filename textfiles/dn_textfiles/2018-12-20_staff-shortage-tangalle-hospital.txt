Staff shortage at Tangalle Hospital

‘There is a shortage of minor staff at the Tangalle Base Hospital, wich has slowed down functioning of the hospital,’ hospital sources said.
Though the hospital minor staff should be around 150, there are only 75 minor employees at the hospital, they said.
The hospital is in need of employees to work in their ambulances, because the hospital requires four workers to be employed in three ambulances, but only two workers are there, they added.
They further said that the hospital needs more nurses.
