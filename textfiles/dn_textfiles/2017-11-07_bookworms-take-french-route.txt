Bookworms take the French route

The Alliance Française of Kotte in Colombo will organised a special opening evening to celebrate the launch of its new library and its Campus France information corner recently.
French Ambassador for Sri Lanka and the Maldives Jean-Marin Schuh, and President of the Alliance Française de Kotte in Colombo Yasapala Nanayakkara, jointly inaugurated the new library at the Alliance Française of Kotte in Colombo.
The library has been entirely renovated and redesigned with a free reading space, and a corner specifically dedicated to kids. An enlarged choice of books, magazines and DVDs are available at the library.
The new Campus France corner is dedicated to helping prospective students to find out more about studying in France, mobility and services offered to international students in France. Campus France is a French national agency for the promotion of higher education, international student services and student mobility in France.
The inauguration was followed by a festive evening “à la française”, with music, wine and crêpes.
