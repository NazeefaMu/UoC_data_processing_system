People need not panic over Influenza ‘B’ - Health Ministry

The Northern Province Health Ministry Specialist Dr. R. Kesevan urged the people of the Mullaithivu area not to panic over the flue reported from the area.
He added that the people should not panic even though it is identified as “Influenza B”, after the special medical team deployed by the Health Ministry had identified that the disease is Influenza B after arriving in Mullaithivu from Colombo.
However, he noted that the disease is curable and therefore people need not panic.
The medical team further said that this flue can be controlled easily and it is not deadly.
However, 10 people have died so far due to the disease.
