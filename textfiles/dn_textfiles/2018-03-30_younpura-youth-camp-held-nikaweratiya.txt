Younpura youth camp held in Nikaweratiya

Although the government received a warning signal from youth at the recently concluded local council elections, its sole objective is to chart a better future for the entirety of the youth generation, rather than to create a better tomorrow only for children of a ruling dynasty Project management, Youth Affairs and Southern Development Minister Sagala Ratnayaka said.
Minister Sagala Ratnayaka said this participating in the inaugural ceremony of the ‘Younpura’ youth camp held at Nikaweratiya as the Chief Guest on March 28.
Minister Ratnayake said, when the results of the local elections were taken into consideration, what the country's youth had requested was for the government to accelerate its programmes to ensure a better future for them. As such, the era had dawned when the government should pay more attention towards country's youth. Ratnayake said, a country's economic development meant the sound foundation laid to develop the country. “We should therefore begin to build youth attitudes and opportunities needed to overcome the challenging needs occurring with the development of the country. Unless that was done, we wont be able to overcome future challenges” Minister Ratnayake said.
Minister Ratnayake said, their sole endeavour was to empower youth politically, socially and culturally. They have paid special attention towards laying the foundation to enable youth to ensure their future security without differences as to race, religion, caste or political orientation. Their endeavour was to create a better tomorrow (Hetak) for all youth without restricting it to the princes of a royal family. That responsibility had been cast on his shoulders in his capacity as Youth Affairs Minister. As such, they were all committed to create a youth generation which realised its dreams without perpetually living in a world of dreams.
