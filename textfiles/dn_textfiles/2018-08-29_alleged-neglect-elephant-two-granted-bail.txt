Alleged neglect of elephant: Two granted bail

Two persons, who were arrested for allegedly neglecting the elephant named ‘Kalana’ of the Devinuwara Vishnu Devalaya, had been released on Rs 100,000 surety bail each when produced before the Matara Magistrate yesterday.
An officer of the Police Media Division said Kalana’s mahout and the Secretary to the Devinuwara Vishnu Devalaya Basnayake Nilame were arrested yesterday for allegedly neglecting the elephant.
‘Kalana’ had been chained at the same place in the Devinuwara Vishnu Devalaya for about three years. As a result its legs had been injured and infected.
The arrests were made following a Police complaint lodged by Wildlife Deputy Minister Palitha Thewarappruma and Wildlife Department officials on Monday. The Deputy Minister intervened after the environmentalists and social media activists brought the matter to his attention.
The veterinarians of National Zoological Gardens Department have already started treating the elephant. They inspected the elephant on Saturday.
The elephant was gifted to the Devalaya in 1989 by former President late Ranasinghe Premadasa. The next date of the court case has been fixed on September 9.
