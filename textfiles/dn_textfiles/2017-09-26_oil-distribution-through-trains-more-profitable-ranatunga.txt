Oil distribution through trains more profitable: Ranatunga

More attention will be paid to use trains to distribute oil island-wide, Petroleum Resources Development Minister Arjuna Ranatunga said.
He said the distribution of oil by trains will be cheaper than distribution through fuel trucks. Steps will be taken to extend provincial fuel storage terminals.
The minister added that plans are afoot to extend Kandy- Peradeniya fuel storage terminal as the first step.
The minister said so during his inspection tour to the Central Province branch of the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation (CPC) in Peradeniya.
During his visit, the minister discussed issues faced by workers and he said steps are taken to remove unnecessary expenses of the CPC.
“It will be more profitable to transport oil by trains to Kandy. I took over this institution to get profits for the CPC. On the other hand, it is difficult for the CPC to make profits because it is providing more relief to consumers. First, we should try to reduce the loss. We already reduced the expenditure of the CPC in a way it does not affect the privileges of workers,” the minister said.
“Even when I was functioning as the Port and Shipping Minister, I lived by this principle. We understood that unnecessary expenses were due to superiors’ behaviour, not the workers’,” he said. “Workers should be responsible and dedicate to this institution,” the minister added
