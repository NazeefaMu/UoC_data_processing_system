Canada urges for inclusive dialogue

Canadian Foreign Affairs Minister Chrystia Freeland yesterday issuing a statement on the State of Emergency, expressed deep concern over the recent violence and urged all sides to engage in inclusive dialogue and exercise restraint to ensure peace and stability.
The statement said: “We call for an immediate end to hate and misinformation campaigns inciting sectarian violence. Canada welcomes the Government of Sri Lanka’s condemnation of the violent acts. Canada calls on the government to ensure the safety and security of all minorities, to protect human rights and fundamental freedoms for all and to hold those responsible for the violence accountable.
“As we said at the United Nations Human Rights Council last month, frustrations persist among those trying to heal the wounds of Sri Lanka’s civil war. Ensuring that diversity and pluralism are valued is critical to the work of reconciliation in Sri Lanka,” the statement added.
