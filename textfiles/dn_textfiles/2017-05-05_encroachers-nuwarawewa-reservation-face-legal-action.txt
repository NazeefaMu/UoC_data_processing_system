Encroachers of Nuwarawewa reservation to face legal action

The Anuradhapura Zonal Irrigation Department is to take back reservation lands of the Nuwarawewa that were occupied by encroachers at present.
The Nuwarawewa is the main water source for over 3,000,000 people.
The zonal irrigation authorities have informed the Anuradhapura Government Agent that nearly 100-acre of lands of the tank reservation were occupied by the encroachers.
Many encroachers have built tourist hotels, holiday resorts, and houses on the tank bed harming the very tank's existence.
The irrigation officials said several government departments and agencies are among the encroachers.
Anuradhapura Chief Irrigation Engineer Jayantha Silva said legal steps were taken already to remove 100 encroachers.
"Recently we acquired two lands where the encroachers have built unauthorised building. We intend to demolish three other such buildings in the near future, the Chief Irrigation Engineer said. He said an attempt to get permission to put up a tourist hotel within the Tisawewa reservation was thwarted recently at the eleventh hour by the irrigation authorities.
