Japanese startup plans Lanka’s first electric vehicle plant

Opening a new chapter in Sri Lankan automotive industry, a Tokyo based high-tech research and development startup is planning Sri Lanka’s first ever large, industry scale electric vehicle (EV) manufacturing facility.
The startup from Tokyo is also setting up international standard EV charging systems known as “micro-grid” stations across the country, as part of their hi-tech transfer to Sri Lanka. A top Japanese investment team consisting of key executives of Tokyo’s Future Science Research Inc (FSRI), along with high ranking former Japanese officials is now in town for the project’s initial groundwork. The proposed EV manufacturing operation is to take off by producing Sri Lanka’s first ever smart, “EV tuk-tuks.”
“We are not coming to Sri Lanka because of the availability of resources -such as cheap labour. If that is the case we can go to some other destination where the resources are available even cheaper” stressed the Chairman of Tokyo based Future Science Research Inc (FSRI) Akihito Matsumura on May 1 in Colombo. FSRI’s Matsumura , who is leading a delegation consisting executives of his company and several former Japanese technocrats. He expressed these views at a meeting with Minister of Industry and Commerce Rishad Bthiudeen.
FSRI’s Matsumura added that his team’s arrival in Colombo is also due to the favorable impressions he received about Sri Lanka from President Maithripala Sirisena’s recent visit to Japan.
Minister Bathiudeen, responding to FSRI’s Matsumura welcomed their plans to launch this new project in Sri Lanka. “This new venture is innovative and Sri Lanka is in fact honored to have it here. It will be a great step forward for Sri Lanka’s automotive sector and will involve both the BoI and my Ministry. I and my officials will extend our fullest cooperation to get this off the ground. Already 85 Japanese FDI projects are here employing 10,000 Sri Lankans. Chairman Matsumura and his team did not reveal any details of their planned investment values in the proposed EV initiative.
In the 10 year period of 2007-2017, Sri Lanka received Japanese FDI investments totalling $ 273 Mn. There are 85 Japanese private sector projects in operation in Sri Lanka at present. Among the sectors of Japanese investments here are semiconductors, printed circuit boards, safety sensors, ceramic items, cement, apparel, building and repairing of ships, power and tourism, infrastructure, and logistics.
