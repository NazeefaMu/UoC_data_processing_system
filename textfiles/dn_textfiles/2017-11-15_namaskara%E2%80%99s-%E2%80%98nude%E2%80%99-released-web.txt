Namaskara’s ‘Nude’ released to the web

Wasantha Namaskara’s latest art exhibition ‘Nude’ will be released to the Internet on November 5. His works will be available on www.wasanthanamaskara.com, youtube, facebook and twitter.
There are many divisions among men. These divisions have reasons justifiable as well as unjustifiable. The men enjoy various divisions in ethnicity, religion and caste. However, all the men are similar in nudity. Likewise, compassion rises only following a nude understanding. Any act done without that nude understanding is nothing but a cheat.
But men chose not to reach the nude understanding because of a special reason.
It is simply because they are blind on visual art. Only a few men manage to escape from this visual art blindness.
