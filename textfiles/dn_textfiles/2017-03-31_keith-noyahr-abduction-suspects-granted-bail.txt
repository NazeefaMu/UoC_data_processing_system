Keith Noyahr abduction: Suspects granted bail

Six suspects including an Army Major arrested and held in remand custody in connection with the abduction and torture of journalist Keith Noyahr were released on a surety bail of Rs. one million each when the case was called before the Mount Lavinia Magistrate yesterday. The identification parade scheduled for yesterday was cancelled due to the absence of Noyahr.
The case will be called again on June 01.
Noyahr was abducted by unidentified men on May 22, 2008.
He was found a day later badly beaten up and with several injuries.
However, the magistrate who considered a ‘B’ report submitted by the CID regarding the assault on journalist Upali Tennekoon ordered the five suspects other than the Army Major to be produced in courts on April 07 in connection with the Tennekoon case.
