Minister Athukorale replies Anunayake Thera regarding monks in prison, uniform

According to Section 106 of the Prison Act, it is mandatory for anyone sentenced to imprisonment to wear the jumper which is the prisoner uniform.
The Commissioner General of Prisons has the responsibility to implement this Act as an official duty, Justice and Prison Reforms Minister Thalatha Athukorale said.
The Minister stated this in reply to a letter addressed to her by Ven. Prof. Kotapitiye Rahula Anunayake Thera, Chief Lekhakadhikari, Kotte Sri Kalyani Samagri Dharma Maha Sangha Sabha. recently.
Ven. Prof Rahula Anunayake Thera, in his letter to the Minister, stated that according to Sri Lanka’s statutory law, the power to expel a bhikku or remove his robe is vested with the Sangha Sabha, which performed the bhikkhu’s ordination and higher ordination. The Commissioner General of Buddhist Affairs also could not do so unless ordered by the Mahanayake Thera of the relevant Nikaya.
Minister Athukorale in her reply to the Anunayake Thera, added that with due respect and honour to the Anunayake Thera, she wished to state that the content of the Thera’s letter was not in keeping with the country’s statutory law.
However, within the Buddhasasana, the removal of the robe is an action taken due to debasement, while a bhikkhu could disrobe on his own.
The full right in this connection rested with the particular Nikaya to which the bhikkhu belonged or the Bhikku himself. No government or ruler or a party representing the government had the right to do so.
Given these facts before an independent court of justice, all citizens of the country are bound to act according to the existing laws of the country and abide by it and respect it, the Minister said.
