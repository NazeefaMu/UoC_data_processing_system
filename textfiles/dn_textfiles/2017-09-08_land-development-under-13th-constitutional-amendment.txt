Land development under 13th Constitutional Amendment

With regard to Provincial finance, the analysis of the provisions reveals a substantial Central Control over Provincial finance. Accordingly provisions that enable the President to give directions to a Governor when financial stability or credit of Sri Lanka or of any part of the territory thereof is threatened are found in Article 154N. In addition, Article 154R establishes a Finance Commission.
Its main duty is to make recommendations as to the principles on which funds granted annually by the Government for the use of the provinces should be apportioned between various Provinces. After all, executive power in respect of provincial matters cannot be exercised without expending money. It is finally the decision of the President, based on the Finance Commission recommendation as to how much money would be allocated for each Province. Moreover, the funds allocated and voted in Parliament shall be deposited in the Provincial Fund. Therefore finance is another instrument used by the National Government to control the activities of a Provincial Council. Moreover, the Provincial Councils Act has made the Governor of a Province the absolute custodian of the Provincial Fund.
The Act lays down that all statutes which involve expenditure from Provincial Fund of a Province shall not be passed by the Provincial Council of a Province unless the Governor has recommended to that Council the consideration of the statute. This position through more powers to the Governor is further strengthened by the provisions of the Provincial Councils (Amendment) Act No. 28 of 1990. Accordingly fiscal devolution in Sri Lanka remains unfinished in establishing Provinces as efficient and accountable providers of public service.
Land development projects
Land administration involves multifarious activities such as land disposal, land alienation, land tenure, land registration. Land development, land redistribution and land use planning. As regards the subject of land even though, land is declared as a devolved subject, it has turned out to be a central function, in terms of the provisions of Appendix II, in List 1 of the Ninth Schedule and Article 33(d) of the Constitution. Accordingly, while the Provincial Councils have power of selection of allottees, it is re-centred through the Divisional Secretary, because, the power of selection of allottees was given to the Divisional Secretary under the Transfer of Powers (Divisional Secretaries) Act No. 58 of 1992.
The provisions relating to the inter – provincial irrigation and land development projects come under item 2.0 of Appendix II (Land and Land Settlement) under the Provincial Council List. Item 2.1 defines such inter – provincial irrigation schemes and land development projects. They include irrigation and land development projects (a) within the Province initiated by the State which utilizes water from rivers flowing through more than one Province. (b) projects within the Province which utilizes water through diversions from water system from outside the Province and (c) all schemes where the command area falls within two or more Provinces such as the Mahaweli Development project.
The constitutional provisions relating to state land, clearly envisage a partnership arrangement and not a rigid demarcation of activities to be exercised solely by the Centre or solely by the Province. The government and the Provincial Councils have to act on the advice of each other or consult each other before acting. For instance, while ‘land’ is declared a Provincial subject, the Government may utilize land within a Province in respect of a reserved or concurrent subject after consulting the relevant Provincial Council. Similarly, any alienation or disposition of State land within a Province shall be exercised by the President (Centre) but on the advice of the Provincial Council.
Currently two Cabinet Ministries namely the Ministry of Irrigation and Water Resources Management and the Ministry of Mahaweli Development and Environment share the responsibility for Central irrigation. Regarding rehabilitation and management of minor irrigation schemes, there is a contradiction. Although minor irrigation is a devolved subject, in practice the responsibilities related to minor irrigation are undertaken by the Department of Agrarian Development under the Central Ministry of Agriculture and Agrarian Development. This situation gives rise to duplication of work, waste and even neglect of some tasks due to lack of coordination and poor accountability.
Provincial Councils system
Under Section 20(A) of the Land Development Ordinance, the Land Commissioner General is vested with the power of selecting persons and issuing of permits for State land without a land Kachcheri. After 1989, this authority was transferred to Provincial Land Commissioner (PLCs) except in inter-provincial schemes. According to Provincial Councils (Consequential Provisions) Act No.12 of 1989, the Provincial Land Commissioners can implement the responsibilities of the Land Commissioner given under the Land Development Ordinance.
Moreover, in terms of the Transfer of Powers (Divisional Secretaries) Act No. 58 of 1992 any powers conferred on the Government Agent can be exercised by the Divisional Secretary. Since Divisional Secretaries are directly accountable to the Ministry of Home Affairs sufficient time may not have been paid by them to the directives from the Ministry of Lands, resulting in delay and even neglect in the implementation of functions.
If the Provincial Councils system is to function smoothly and meaningfully much needs to be done legislatively and administratively to fill the lacunae in the law to ensure that the transition from a centralized system of administration to a decentralized one facilitates the achieving of the main objective of the scheme a means of power-sharing among the different ethno-cultural groups providing a settlement of the major grievances of the minority group. The present status of the Provincial Councils system with all its infirmities does not warrant such optimism.
