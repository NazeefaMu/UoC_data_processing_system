Experts urge need for research, innovation

Sri Lanka needs to reactivate plans to make Trace Expert City a space for IT research and innovation and similar facilities should be promoted and enabled in Jaffna, Matara, Kandy and Kurunegala, said Rohan Samarajiva, founding Chair of LIRNEasia, at the recent Sri Lanka Economic Summit 2017 held in colombo.
Moreover, measures should be taken to encourage angel and venture capital finance and promote incubators and accelerators, while providing incentives for Lankan companies to create space for innovation.
Meanwhile, Project Director of the Coordinating Secretariat for Science, Technology and Innovation, Professor Ajith De Alwis said that Sri Lanka’s innovation eco-system is disconnected and disjointed, despite the fact the country has 66 institutions under 20 line ministries which are capable of R&D and being a part of the innovation process.
Of 66 institutions, 17 come under the public university system and Sri Lanka is not maximizing the existing resources to achieve greater economic prosperity.
Claiming that Sri Lanka’s expenditure on R&D as a percentage of GDP is way below than least developing countries, De Alwis revealed that Sri Lanka spends 0.1% of GDP on R&D as against the recommended level of 1%.
According to Prof. De Alwis, in terms of R&D, Sri Lanka has quite small inputs spread across in the public system under a large number of institutions which are operating in different compartments.
“When we don’t make use of our synergies, it’s an unfortunate situation.
It is also unfortunate that the public sector doesn’t understand the private sector requirements and sometimes the private sector doesn’t understand what the public sector does. The gap needs to be bridged by communication.”
Prof. De Alwis also urged the need to maximize the available resources and execute a planned approach to increase the resource base.
