Cat-walk?

Just like a walking pun come to life, a cat set the internet on fire when it decided to strut its stuff on the ‘catwalk.’ Yes, it all occurred at the Esmod International Fashion Show held in Emaar Square Mall in Istanbul, Turkey, much to the delight of all the onlookers.
Attendees at the event filmed the new model clean herself and even swat her paw at the human participants, followed up by a strut worthy of Tyra.
The fashion designer, Göksen Hakki Ali, told The Dodo, “Everybody was in shock.” But shock factor is favored in the fashion world, so when asked if the cat had a future career Ali responded, “Haha, maybe, why not?”
