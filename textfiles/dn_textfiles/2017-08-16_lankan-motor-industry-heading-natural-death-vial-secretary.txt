Lankan motor industry heading for natural death- VIAL Secretary

The Sri Lankan motor industry was heading for a natural death unless corrective steps were taken by the government immediately to rectify the situation, said Keerthi Gunawardena, Secretary, Vehicle Importers Association of Lanka (VIAL).
It is important that there should be a fixed market for vehicle importers and it was essential that foundation steps be taken from this year’s budget for that and the implementation of a practical taxation system for the vehicle industry. This should be carried out for some time without change, he opined speaking to Biz Motor.
The Central Bank restriction of loan value (LTV) ratio on leasing facilities on vehicles was not acceptable to the industry. Due to the LTV restriction people buying vehicles for the first time find it very difficult affording the capital because 50% of the vehicle cost has to be available in the customer’s hand at the time of purchase. Gunawardena recalled that there was a time that 100% of the price of the vehicle was allowed to be provided by the finance company. Due to this 50% LTV restriction on vehicles the government has totally discouraged first time buyers from purchasing cars for which constitute to 40 %, because they were unable to afford a huge lump sum payment. As a result the Sri Lankan motor industry was heading for a natural death, he reiterated.
Gunawardena said electric vehicles suit Sri Lanka very much because it does not contribute to air pollution.
In European counties when people purchase electrics vehicles the government refunds the duty to the end user, but in Sri Lanka the government collects substantial amount of duty from electric vehicles. What they suggest is that the duties collected from electric vehicles be returned to the end user at the time of registering the vehicle not as a physical refund but by giving the customer a solar power unit.
The customer can charge the car from the solar unit and the balance units could be obtained to the national grid free of charge by the government. He also said by introducing hybrid vehicles the air pollution in Colombo has gone down drastically. The VIAL Secretary said when consider the number of road accidents happening safety features was essential for vehicles and at least Euro standard safety features were essential for Sri Lanka . But there are some vehicles that are coming into the country without a single safety feature and without a single euro standard. “Therefore safety standards such as ABS brakes, airbags, auto gear and pre-crash safety systems are a must for a country like us,” he said.
Gunawardena also alleged that customers have to face difficulties due to unethical activities of personal importers. He said they were not against these personal importers of vehicles but the problem arises once these personal importers start selling the vehicles. He said permanent importers have to maintain their business with overheads. Hence they had made suggestions to regularize these imports and to implement Rs 15,000 at the time of opening LC’s for motor cars. But this is just a charge now. By implementing this ‘nothing happen’, he said. “Still the personal importers are engaged in various ways to import vehicles,” he alledged.
Gunawardena said changing policies on vehicle industry regularly should not be done and the government must keep one policy for a period for at least five years. The biggest challenge the industry faces is these irregular government policies, personal imports which is not for personal use and the issue of permits, he said.
Gunawardena said they prefer vehicle clearance done in Hambantota and not Colombo. Even though the distance is far away they prefer Hambantota because they were instrumental with the former minister and the port authority people to implement systems in Hambantota Port for smooth vehicle clearance.
There was a good set up for vehicle clearance in Hambantota with minimum pilferage and damages to vehicles because there was ample space for parking. “You were able to get a vehicle out within a day because of the good system there in Hambantota,” he said. In Colombo the port authority people also find it difficult to find space to park vehicles. Colombo Port is very much congested and there are more opportunities for pilferage and theft in a big scale,” he said. Gunawardenasaid they have experienced that before and were heading towards that disaster again by shifting vehicle clearance to Colombo . Gunawardena said the Trincomalee harbour which is about the same distance to Hambantota could be developed for vehicle transshipment and if the government can develop the Trinco habour for vehicle transshipment it will be good for the country as well as vehicle importers.
Also the government must create a level playing field for all vehicles importers, the VIAL Secretary cautioned. Franchised holders take the advantage of a much lesser valuation but VIAL has to import on a very much higher valuation, he alleged. Gunawardena said there are a lot of irregularities in the issuing of valuations by franchise holders and even the Customs depend on them at times. He said they had met the new finance minister and requested to carry on with the existing duty system for awhile without increasing it and they also had requested to streamline the valuation system and to introduce a unique rate to all vehicle categories for the purpose of the calculation of customs duty on vehicles. VIAL therefore urged the minister to go by unit rate based on the engine capacity method for all vehicle categories and do away with the higher valuation system completely.
Vehicles of the 1,300 cc to1,600 cc engine capacities suit Sri Lankan road conditions very much and the expected economic fuel efficiency levels, Gunawardane added.
