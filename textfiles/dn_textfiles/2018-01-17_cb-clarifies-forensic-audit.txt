CB clarifies on forensic audit

There has been a call for an immediate statement from the Central Bank of Sri Lanka on whether there have been any irregularities in the issuing of government securities during the period 2008-2014.
In this connection, attention is drawn to the statement issued by the Monetary Board of the Central Bank of Sri Lanka on January 11, 2018.
The last paragraph therein indicates that a forensic audit would be conducted. The audit will focus on government securities and EPF operations during the period 2008-2014.
This would be conducted by an external party. It is not appropriate to make any statement in this regard prior to the conclusion of the forensic audit, the Central Bank said.
