CAA on the watch during festive season

The Consumer Affairs Authority (CAA) has taken measures to carry out special raids to nab errant traders throughout the country during the upcoming festive season.
CAA Deputy Director Asela Bandara told the Daily News a special programme is in place to minimise injustice caused to consumers, from November 15 to January 15, next year.
During these raids, the CAA flying squad would not only check the places selling food items, but places selling clothes, electrical items and essential goods as well. "We want to encourage businessmen to sell quality goods and stop fraudulent trading," he said.
He added that raids are always intensified during any festive season because as sales increase, traders tend to engage in illegal acts.
Officials of the CAA have been given special instructions to check even mobile shops as well as places conducting sales, he said.
The raids are carried out on traders who violate the Consumer Protection Act by selling goods unsuitable for consumption, underweight goods, selling above the controlled price, not displaying the retail prices, storing of goods without proper standards, and selling expired products.
He added that the CAA has focused attention on some traders who are using various gimmicks such as discounts and special year-end sales to sell spoiled or expired goods and substandard items.
The CAA flying squad will conduct raids even during the weekends and holidays and stern action will be taken against errant traders. He further said that people should be aware of the consumer laws and the CAA will conduct a leaflet campaign to educate consumers. If any person is violating the law, they can call 1977, the hotline of the CAA,” he said.
