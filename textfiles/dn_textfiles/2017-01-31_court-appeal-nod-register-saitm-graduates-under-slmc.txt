Court of Appeal nod to register SAITM graduates under SLMC

 
The Court of Appeal had directed the Sri Lanka Medical Council (SLMC) to grant provisional registration to the South Asian Institute of Technology and Management (SAITM) Medical graduates, today (31).
The decision had been made in spite of the massive protests conducted by Inter-University Students’ Federation and Government Medical Officers' Association (GMOA) against SAITM at Malabe, for the past few months.
