No more fertiliser  for Galgamuwa tobacco growers

The Galgamuwa Regional Agriculture Committee in Kurunegala will discontinue fertiliser supplies to tobacco growers in the electorate from the 2018/2019 Maha season.
A Galgamuwa Agrarian Services Centre official told the Daily News that the decision had been made due to the increase in cancer patient numbers in Kurunegala.
There were about 1,278 cancer patients in Kurunegala, he added.
Galgamuwa has around 150 acres of tobacco cultivation.
