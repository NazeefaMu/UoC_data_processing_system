‘Anti-SAITM People’s Summit to be held in Colombo on July 20’

A new organisation called `Anti SAITM People’s Barricade’ (SAITM Virodhi Jana Pawra) was set up in Colombo on July 10 and the Anti SAITM People’s Summit will take place in Colombo on July 20 with the participation of its member organizations, National Trade Union Centre Chairman K. D. Lal Kantha said.
He was addressing a press conference held at the Organization of Professionals’ Association (OPA) in Colombo yesterday.
He said that during the summit, crucial decisions such as launching a national strike will be taken. “The Anti SAITM People’s Barricade will take measures to abolish the SAITM. No one will be able to stop the crusade against the SAITM,” he said.
General Secretary of the Ceylon Teachers’ Services Union Mahinda Jayasinghe said his organisation extends its support towards the front and the teachers and principals will not let the education to be sold for money. Island wide trade union actions will be taken along with the front, he said.
The President of the Inter Company Employees Union Wasantha Samarasinghe said the Government is trying to kill the rights of 8,000 medical students to save 1,000 `medical students’ who are waiting to become doctors for money. “Now the Government has only two options. That is either let the SAITM function and go home or abolish it and stay in power,” he said.
Public Service Trade Union Federation (PSTUF) President W.H. Piyadasa said if the Government does not give a reply to the SAITM, the people will give a reply to the Government, and the country will head for disaster if the President change his decisions according to one minister’s wishes.
