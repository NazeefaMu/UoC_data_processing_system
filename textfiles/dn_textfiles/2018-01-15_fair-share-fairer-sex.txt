Fair share for the fairer sex

Once flaunted for her beauty she was the queen of all married women. Being remembered merely for her looks was not her dream; placing brains before beauty she seized the opportunity to become the voice of the most vulnerable in the society ­– women and children. Deputy Chief of Staff at the Prime Minister’s Office, Rosy Senanayake shoulders the responsibility of troubleshooting and resolving the many grievances people from all over the country come with. As it is always not possible to meet the Prime Minister, Senanayake acts as the buffer and directs the people who come to see him to right places while also tackling gender and children’s issues in the society. Running for Mayor of Colombo Senanayake has comprehensive plans for the city. Here she shared her thoughts on women in Sri Lanka calling not only women but as many men as possible to be advocates for gender equality.
* How do you see women in Sri Lanka today?
The Sri Lankan women are smart, strong, capable, enduring and are multi-taskers especially in taking responsibilities of the family institution since 1/3rd of the households in this country are headed by women. They have shown the strength to deliver results at every level and excel beyond the nation’s expectations.Women are an integral part of the development in the country’s economy since they earn the larger portion of the foreign revenue; may it be through the migrant woman worker, apparel industry or the agriculture sector. However women are deprived, discriminated against and at their fundamental rights are violated and their dignity is compromised since there are also discriminatory laws pertaining to women in this country.
The country is yet to realize, understand, discover the capacity of a woman and engage her in every aspect of the development of the country.
* What are the areas that you think still need change to support or empower women in the country?
The country needs to do a lot more to bring in women leadership. Women are in the forefront in any sector in the economy including education and health care but those who are in the decision making positions are handful. You have to change this mind set. Males easily get promotions and handle top positions. A career woman has to face lot of discrimination in the society. It is astonishing to see that men have mastered many fields that are culturally thought to be a woman’s specialty. Beauty and cookery are two main fields that men have taken over. If you take the hospitality industry from preparing to meals and to arranging beds are done by males. The chores man wouldn’t do at home, he does for a career and those services are recognized and accepted. Even internationally, in countries like in India all the best designers are males but sewing and stitching are culturally thought to be what women should be doing at home. As for women they face a lot of discrimination. They are always given light responsibilities in careers. I am really happy Thalatha Athukorala was made the Minister of Justice, a ministry which was predominantly handled by a man. We need to come out of the framed mindset and attitudes for the country to move forward. Drastic decisions have to be made and policies have to be changed to involve women in decision making.
Other countries have empowered women far greater than Sri Lanka. Norway has established crèches to get women involved in the workforce while giving a year off to both parents to take care of the young children. When a conducive environment is created allowing the woman to take care of her family she will be able to contribute to the economy paying taxes which will in turn benefit the State.
Even today, women go to the Middle East for a pittance. I don’t think as a Government we have negotiated well enough with regard to safety and salary. Empowering women economically in a sustainable and viable manner – that’s something the Prime Minister has been reiterating recently.
Security is one of the major issues due to violence against women in this country. Violence against women has become normalized and it is very important that all sectors of society be educated on this issue so that we can bring about an attitude shift.
Nutrition for women is another major issue. We don’t realise how many pregnant mothers are malnourished in the far-flung villages. This is why I brought in the Rs. 20,000 package for every pregnant mother and that is still being carried on. There are other social areas as well. We have a huge female-headed household rate. One in every third household is headed by a woman. Single parenting is an issue. We need to have more social welfare. When it comes to loan schemes and housing projects, we need to give them an edge and have concessional programs. We need to see how we can help women start businesses, by perhaps giving them special provision to not requiring collateral, giving them special loans with minimum interest rates and so on. I believe that is an area we need to concentrate on, especially in relation to women in the north and east and in the deep south, who are suffering.
* The Guardian, in its list of top ten sexist moments in politics included your sexist attack in the Parliament along other renowned women politicians such as Australian PM Julia Gillard and Hillary Clinton. Do you see this situation changed as of present?
I have faced a lot of sexism in the Parliament, political rallies and in meetings. People have a culturally weird and warped mindset. Rape, sexual harassments etc are at unacceptable levels. We have to train young children to respect a woman. In Sri Lanka we only upgrade the numeracy and literacy but we do not address the social and emotional thinking of a child. The first five years are the most crucial years of a human being’s life as 75 per cent of brain development takes place during this time. Thus right attitudes have to be inculcated in them at this age if we need reconciliation and peace to last. President has appointed a task force of which I am a member and I am happy that I was able to bring a subject called `Think Equal’ which offers a social and emotional value-based education. It will be taught in schools this year onwards and will cut across caste, creed, religion and gender, practically every discriminative platform and will teach empathy and gender equality.
* How inspirational have your life been to women that you came into contact with? What was the response you got as an activist for women’s rights?
Well I hope that I have been able to be a positive role model for women in Sri Lanka. I have always advocated for equality for women and strived hard to make sure that women in this country get a fair deal. As a women’s rights activist I have faced a lot of opposition and hostility but have for the most part been able to win over these people and make them see that women have great capacity and that it makes no sense to discriminate against them. As an activist I have also been fortunate to receive the support of thousands of strong, dedicated, hard working women and many men who support women.
I am aware that becoming the first female mayor will make me more of a role model. As a woman, I will have to do more than just live up to expectations; I will have to exceed them. And I plan to do just that! I also realize that I will be seen as a pioneer for women holding very high leadership positions in government and people will be watching me to see how women perform in positions of leadership. My performance in this role will have repercussions for future female leaders. I am confident that I will be able to lead Colombo to become a safe, smart, economically viable, and corruption free City which caters to and empowers all sections of its citizenry, leaving no doubt about the leadership potential and efficacy of women! I hope that my election as mayor and performance in this role will act as an example to our youth- both female and male- that female leadership is not something to be feared or disdained but something to be encouraged and fostered.
* Currently, how are female candidates handling the campaigns to take up positions in the local government and then later on in the Parliament?
Our female candidates are handling the campaigning very well. The new electoral system is more conducive to these candidates as it minimizes the impact of money and thuggery which have been big obstacles to female candidates in the past. The women we have nominated are very experienced and we have also focused on nominating several professionals. They are doing a great job and have been especially focused on door to door campaigning which is essential in the ward system of election. I am very confident that our candidates will win their seats.
More women have to be elected to Parliament. Sri Lanka has one of the worst records in the world with regard to women legislators. I strongly believe that it is the PR system that is depriving women of their rightful access. The system is warped and I am a good example. I lost the elections last time. An enormous amount of money is involved in campaigning under the PR system. Gun and character assassination are rife. A lot of women who want to enter politics are being discouraged just there. Political parties find it very attractive to bring in people with a tailor-made, readymade voter base, people who can fight in the gun culture and put in more money into elections. They get nominations and preference over women. This won’t change unless and until you change the political system to a First Past the Post and Proportional Representation mixed system and also have a quota of seats.For me, affirmative action is the also essential. Creating a reservation of seats or a quota in Parliament even just for two terms will enable women to get in there and prove themselves.
* As you are running for Mayor of Colombo what are your plans for the city if elected?
My plans are for a safe, smart, economically viable and corruption free city in which people will benefit and be empowered. The CMC is the most important council. Colombo is the hub of Sri Lanka and the CMC is one of the largest and oldest municipalities in the Asian Region.
I am focusing on seven pillars to bring about a new and vital Colombo. In terms of the effectiveness and accessibility of the CMC I plan to focus on The Effectiveness and Efficiency of CMCand Participatory Citizenship. I plan to leverage ICT to ensure the effectiveness and efficiency of the CMC with online applications and payments, E-procurement etc. Monitoring will be given priority through a high-level Monitoring and Progress Review Unit reporting directly to the Mayor to tackle issues, public complaints, and requests (with response deadlines) to ensure the effectiveness and efficiency of all activities and functions of CMC. I plan to actively involve the citizenry in planning, implementation, and monitoring the policies and activities of the CMC. This will involve drafting a Citizens’ Charter in consultation with all stakeholders, participatory budgets and planning, information dissemination on activities and progress review of CMC by the community. I also plan to hold town hall style meetings where the CMC will meet in public for public hearings once every quarter.
In terms of giving ownership to the people, another major pillar of my manifesto is to establish Multifunctional Community Centers which will empower the community to tackle a variety of issues by funding, reinvigorating, and strengthening existing community centers and establishing new ones. The idea is that these Centers will be a vehicle for the community to come together to tackle issues that are most pressing for their locality; whether it be dengue control, garbage collection, or safety etc. Each center will also cater to the community by providing services like day care, drop in centers for street children, vocational, IT, and English training, counseling services, elder citizens activities, recreation etc.
A Healthy City and A Healthy Citizenry is another pillar of my plans. A priority will be tackling dengue. We willcontrol dengue by identifying hotspots of dengue using past data and the new app ‘Epi Hack’ and prioritizing areas with highest dengue incidence. We will also get the whole community involved thorough the Multifunctional Community Centers described above. We will begin a “zero dengue deaths drive” focusing on early detection, early diagnosis, and early treatment.
We need a clean city and the CMC is doing a good job but there is a lot more to be done. We need to establish permanent and sustainable solutions that can address the garbage issue such as permanent dumping sites and implementing projects such as turning waste to energy, recycling, and addressing clinical and hazardous waste issues etc. We must further educate the people on garbage segregation and make them responsible partners with the CMC to keep the city clean.
We will also focus on quality control of food of city eateries through a Central Control Unit using both carrot and stick measures, managing Pollution (noise pollution, visual pollution and air quality) using zoning laws, urban agriculture (home composting and urban garden concept), and recreational areas such as walking paths, green parks etc.
Infrastructure is another priority. I will make maximum use of the CMC’s power’s to ease the burden of traffic for those living and working in Colombo. We will use shuttles, tackle parking issues, ear-mark land for separate parking areas for private vehicles, school busses and vans and three-wheelers, etc.
Among priority areas will be sanitation, clean drinking water, and toilet facilities, especially for the underserved settlements. These are areas we can immediately work on since the CMC has quite a lot of underserved settlements which also need proper housing facilities. The CMC has the land and the capacity to do it. We will be looking at new council homes for these people who are living in harsh conditions. I think my experience and connections at the national level put me in a unique position to advocate on these issues and get things done.
The sewage systems we have are archaic and it is time for us to look at some major revamping. Fifty years ago, the population of the CMC city limits was much less than it is today; with the demands of the increase of population and infrastructure development, the system is now congested and not functioning effectively, hence we are looking at World Bank and Asian Development Bank funded projects with regard to the sewage system and waste water.
As for roads, there is an approximately 300 km road network which must be maintained and reconstructed. There are some projects in progress with the World Bank and Asian Development Bank but there is more work to be done. Flooding is an issue to be addressed and waste water disposal projects will be looked at seriously.
The municipality has many playgrounds and parks; these need to be improved to include activities for kids. We need to maintain the grounds, add gyms, sports clubs, and recreation facilities, which would help in keeping the youth off the streets and improve their living standards.
Cultural Development is another pillar of a new and revitalized Colombo. To cater to the future demands, we have space and areas that we have already identified to turn into restaurant strips, tourist strips and for the residents to have leisure activities such as hawker streets. We have so far identified eight places for PPPs in this regard, including Marine Drive, where we can have light entertainment for people and families. Lighting up the city and giving the city a new face would also be top priority.
Importantly we will also actively promote Colombo as a multicultural center using PPP, for example to foster local arts, develop cultural museums, create cultural zones etc. Colombo is a unique place with its own history, traditions, and arts scenes. We hope that this will bring about e must be more cultural and ethnic integration within the City.
Finally, Women and Children. I will be focusing on Maternal and Child healthcare and a nutrition package, establishing new day care centers (PPPs) and monitoring existing ones etc. It is also important to have income generating programs and training programs, especially for women, with an emphasis on empowering them in practically every possible aspect, including reproductive health. A lot of women in Colombo City find it hard to make ends meet; we want to give them solid income generating programs.
With regard to children, early childhood education and preschools will be top priority. I will also look at PPPs for vocational training for school dropouts, and an opportunity to learn English for every child in these areas. Our focus is to keep children off the streets, which is in line with the Prime Minister’s vision, where education is compulsory from Grade 1-13, and we will support this system. I will also focus on drop-in centers for street children and the homeless, family strengthening programs to prevent institutionalization of children, and school entry program for facilitate school admission of children of urbanites.
* What is your advice for working women in the country? How can they be successful as a mother, housewife and as a career woman?
Being a working woman is by no means easy. It means balancing work, home, and family. Even today, women shoulder a disproportionate share of responsibility for looking after their homes, their children, elderly parents and relatives etc. Hopefully this will change with people becoming more aware of the responsibilities of men as husbands, fathers, and sons but we still have a long way to go. The workplace also has to change to become more supportive of working parents by providing more maternity and paternity leave, opportunities for flexi time etc.
I have worked all my adult life and have been lucky enough to manage to balance that with family very successfully. I think having a supportive spouse is extremely important. If your spouse doesn’t support your career and is not willing to share the responsibilities of family, it is going to be much more difficult.
I advise all young women to ensure that they consider this when choosing a future life partner! It is also important to make sure you have a village of people to support you- friends, family, colleagues etc- who will pick up the slack at those times when you are overwhelmed.
Sri Lankan women are hard working, educated, and intelligent and are more than capable of balancing work and family and I encourage all women to see themselves as the strong and capable people that they are.
