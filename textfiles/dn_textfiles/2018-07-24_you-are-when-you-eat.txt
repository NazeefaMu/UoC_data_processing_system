You are when you eat

Eating dinner late increases your risk of two deadly cancers, experts have warned. And not leaving at least two hours between scoffing your last meal of the day and hitting the hay, also hikes your chances of developing breast and prostate cancer.
Meal times may affect the body’s ability to process food, boffins at the Barcelona Institute for Global Health said. They found people who eat dinner before 9 pm or two hours before nodding off were 20 per cent less likely to develop the diseases.
The scientists looked at the diet and lifestyles of 621 patients with prostate cancer, 1,205 people with breast cancer and a control group pf 2,193, who didn’t have cancer.
Those who considered themselves “morning types”, rather than “night owls”, had a 33 per cent lower risk if they ate early.They found people who eat dinner before 9pm or two hours before nodding off were 20 per cent less likely to develop the diseases
Breast and prostate cancers are among those most strongly associated with night-shift work and body clock disruption.
Cancer prevention advice has previously focused more on what people eat, rather than when.
Prof Manolis Kogevinas, who led the study, said “If these findings are confirmed they will have profound implications on recommendations for the timing of the last main meal.“The impact could be especially important in cultures such as those of southern Europe where people have supper late.”
Dora Romaguera, who also worked on the study, said: “Everything seems to indicate that the timing of sleep affects our capacity to metabolise food.”
She said more research is needed to added the animal data shows “profound implications for food metabolism and health”.The findings are published in the International Journal of Cancer. The Sun
