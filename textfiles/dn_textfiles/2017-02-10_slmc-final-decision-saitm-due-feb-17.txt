SLMC final decision on SAITM due on Feb. 17

The final decision of the Sri Lanka Medical Council (SLMC) on SAITM will be declared on February 17, SLMC sources said.
According to sources, the management committee of the SLMC met yesterday. The meeting was headed by SLMC President Prof. Carlo Fonseka. They decided to declare their decision on February 17.
Prof. Fonseka said SLMC approval cannot be given to SAITM until it meets the required standards.
Currently, SLMC lawyers are studying the case file on the SAITM judgement given by the Court of Appeal, the source said.
Meanwhile, the Specialist Doctors’ Association has stated that they will extend their fullest support to the SLMC and accept the SLMC decision on SAITM. Association President Dr. Nimal Ratnasena informed the SLMC of their association’s decision. During a discussion between the SLMC and the Specialist Doctors’ Association, it was decided to demand the Health Minister to introduce and pass laws in Parliament in connection with the Minimum Standards on commencing private medical faculties.
