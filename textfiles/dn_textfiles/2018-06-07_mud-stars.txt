From the MUD to the STARS

I confess I know nothing about Penelope Lively. Nor have I read any of her books. This could be because unlike some of the younger male writers of our time - Salman Rushdie, Julian Barnes and Ian McEwan - she has never been in the limelight. For Eighty-Five years she has lived a sedate, headline-resistant life: no scandals, no feuds, just one marriage. As some critics see it, her life is like the plot of a badly written happily-ever-after novel.
This could be why in 2005, she published a sort of anti-memoir, “Making It Up,” in which she imagines all the different directions her life MIGHT have taken. What if she’d become an archaeologist? What if she’d married an American? What if she’d had an illegitimate child? She never did, of course, and so she never grabbed the attention of the world and always remained ‘on the edge of the radar’. Yet, Penelope Lively is the only writer to have won both the Carnegie Medal for children’s literature and the Booker Prize. Just last week she was nominated for the Man Booker International 2018. In her writing career spanning more than four decades she has written 31 books for children, 22 novels for adults and 4 non-fiction.
Born Penelope Margaret Low in Cairo in 1933, where her father, an Englishman who belonged to the southern gentry, was employed by the National Bank of Egypt, she grew up there until almost the end of World War II. She still remembers the city then with vivid exactness — even the tins of water in which her bed legs sat, to keep ants from crawling up. She was raised and educated, after a fashion, by a nanny who hadn’t had much schooling herself. When Lively was 12, her parents’ marriage broke up in scandalous fashion and her mother went off with another man, abandoning her to the custody of her father, who promptly sent her to school in England, an experience Lively describes as fairly catastrophic. “It was ghastly. I’d never been to any kind of school, and I was hopeless at it. “ Lively remembers the school as “extraordinarily unimaginative. One punishment was to read for an hour in the library, which pretty much summed up the attitude towards literature. I was reprimanded by the headmistress for having a copy of the Oxford Book of Modern Verse in my locker.”
Still, Lively excelled in the school certificate at 16, prompting her father to pay a visit to her headmistress. “He said to her: ‘I understand that quite a few girls go to university nowadays. I was wondering if Penelope should think of it.’ The headmistress looked at him in horror and replied ‘Oh no, no - our girls don’t do that.’ The implication was that you got your school certificate and married - or at worst tried a domestic science course.” Luckily, her father took a more enlightened view. Lively was moved to a crammer, and applied to Oxford to read modern history. “I wasn’t an assiduous student, and I didn’t get a good degree, but it certainly formed my mindset,” she says.
It was at Oxford, too, that Lively met her husband. Newly graduated, Lively was working as a research assistant when Jack, a working-class boy from New Castle arrived. “I’d heard some of the other fellows talking about this very clever chap coming over from Cambridge called Jack Lively. I remember thinking the name sounded like a character in an 18th-century play,” she smiles. Their friendship, fostered “over coffee in smoke-filled rooms”, quickly blossomed, and in less than a year the pair were married. It was a relationship that sustained them both until Jack’s death from cancer in 1998, 41 years later. “In many ways Jack was very different from me: much cleverer, very combative. His chief intellectual pleasure was a good argument, and he had a shorter fuse than I have.” But he was, she says, always quick to apologize - and when it came to her writing, he acted as both ally and advocate. “He thoroughly enjoyed the fact that I wrote, and was always my first reader. I never asked him directly ‘what do you think?’, because of course what you want to hear is that the whole thing’s superb, and he would never have said that. But he commented on the specifics. I don’t have that any longer, and I miss it hugely.”
It was when she was in her late 30s that Lively first began to write. “I’m one of those people for whom reading became writing,” she recalls. “Because of my odd childhood, I’ve always been an obsessive, avid reader, and that went on and on and on. Not every obsessive reader feels the need to turn into a writer, but a few do, and I’ve never met any writer worth his salt who wasn’t an obsessive reader.”
She started writing children’s books — her first, “Astercote,” was published in 1970. The best of them, the Carnegie-winning “The Ghost of Thomas Kempe” (1973), is said to be in some ways a grown-up book in disguise: The ghost is really a metaphor for the persistence of the past.
Throughout her career in adult fiction, the perception that Lively is a “women’s writer” - with all the vaguely negative connotations of that label - has persisted. After all, she is fascinated by families, gives precedence to relationships and is comfortable writing within the domestic sphere. Even the novel that put her on the map, the 1987 Booker-winning “Moon Tiger,” was criticized for being a “housewife’s” book. But Lively rejects the classification. “I don’t think it’s true,” she says. “My novel, ‘Consequences’ was romantic, but everyone’s entitled to one of those, surely? And Family Album is indeed a family book; but after all, men live family lives too. I find the notion that a book could be ‘for’ women or men puzzling.” (It would be fair to say that perhaps the idea she is a women’s writer comes from people who haven’t read her).
According to an article in the Guardian, “Moon Tiger,” is anything but romantic. The story is a series of deathbed reflections by a woman named Claudia Hampton, who tells a nurse, “I’m writing a history of the world,” and then adds, to herself: “The works, this time. The whole triumphant murderous unstoppable chute, from the mud to the stars, universal and particular, your story and mine.” She looks back on her life — childhood, love affairs (including an incestuous one), motherhood, her years as a war correspondent — in scenes that seem arranged in almost random order. Sometimes they’re even repeated, first from one character’s slant, then from another’s. Just as the narrator intends, the book works like a kaleidoscope: “Shake the tube and see what comes out.”
Today, at the age of eighty-five, Lively lives alone in a house overlooking a leafy square in the London borough of Islington. Charles McGrath who interviewed her last year for the New York Times says she is unusually tall, which gives her a kind of instant authority, and dresses in matronly camouflage: scarves and twin sets. Her friend and neighbor Jane Seaton, a professor at the University of Westminster, says she’s “beady,” someone who sees everything but doesn’t give away a whole lot.” She has a badly arthritic back, she underwent breast-cancer surgery a few years back, and her eyes have started to go. Her balance is so bad that taking the Underground makes her dizzy. She says she has been ambushed by old age and that she is now waiting ‘in the departure lounge’. Yet, she is cheerful about being old. “This house is full of Post-it slips reminding me of this, that and the other. But my long-term memory is very good. I remember my childhood vividly. I just had a birthday, and old-age birthdays become more like childhood birthdays, when there’s a huge difference, say, between being 8 and being 10. Well, there’s quite a lot of difference between being 84 and 85. You notice your contemporaries and you think, ‘My goodness, she’s 86!’” she laughs.
And as she puts it, she still has all her marbles.
This is why unlike Philip Roth and Alice Munro she does not see why she should retire. “I wouldn’t know what to do if I wasn’t writing,” she says. “I’d feel very restless. I know if I start something new I may never finish it, but it’s what you do. A writer writes.”

Quotable Quotes  from Penelope Lively  1.“When you are able to be with a person and there is no need to talk, something has happened.” 2.“Giving presents is one of the most possessive things we do, did you realize that? It’s the way we keep a hold on other people. Plant ourselves in their lives.” 3.“Children are not like us. They are beings apart: impenetrable, unapproachable. They inhabit not our world but a world we have lost and can never recover. 4. “The past is our ultimate privacy; we pile it up, year by year, decade by decade, it stows itself away, with its perverse random recall system.”
