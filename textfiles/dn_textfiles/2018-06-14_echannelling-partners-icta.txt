eChannelling partners ICTA

eChannelling PLC, the largest Doctor Channeling Network in Sri Lanka, along with Mobitel, and the Information and Communication Technology Agency of Sri Lanka (ICTA) have embarked on a national endeavour – “eChannelling for Government Hospitals” - as a service provider for OPD time reservation at government hospitals.
This project is carried out under the guidance of the Ministry of Health, Ministry of Telecommunication and Digital Infrastructure and Foreign Employment, and ICTA to build a healthier nation by upgrading the existing health care system in Sri Lanka and enhancing its position in global rankings. This historic partnership will vastly facilitate smooth access to medical care for government hospital patients. eChannelling believes this service will enhance convenience for government hospital patients and save time and energy spent waiting in queues. The service is offered free-of-charge.
This service offers greater convenience for hospitals as they are able to enable modern healthcare facilities through technology to the general public free-of-charge. This would also help hospitals to better utilize physical infrastructure and human resources more effectively and efficiently. This service also greatly benefits patients as it saves them time otherwise spent waiting at the OPD for hours, and keeps the hospital informed in advance about their service requirements. The facility will be launched island wide in the future as a national endeavor to revolutionize the health care sector and build a healthy nation.
