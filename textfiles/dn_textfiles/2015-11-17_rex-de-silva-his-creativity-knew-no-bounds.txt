Rex de Silva - His creativity knew no bounds

I was 19, had just put my A/Ls behind me, and was on my first job interview. Naive, inexperienced and quite unexposed to the darker facets of life, I was nevertheless bubbling with enthusiasm as I went to meet the editor of the SUN and WEEKEND. Walking in to his office, I was momentarily dazzled by the unexpected vision of a smart, trendy looking 30-ish gentleman dressed in denim and sporting bracelet and chain that matched his silver hair. He asked me many questions and one I remember well was, "If we sent you to cover a situation that involved public disorder and mayhem can you handle it?" I grinned like the very green aspiring journo that I was and said yes without batting an eyelid. Deputy Editor Iqbal Athas walked in at that moment and Rex told him, "She says she isn't afraid to cover any assignment."
I think it had little to do with that display of naive I-can-do-anything optimism and more to do with the fact that the WEEKEND needed a sub pronto, but just when I returned home after a long bus ride in a CTB boneshaker, there was call from the newspaper. It was Rex asking me to report to work the next day!
That was the beginning of my long tenure at Independent Newspapers - and a sound, non-formal training by this charismatic journalist that has held me in good stead ever since.
I have told everyone who would listen that I was thrown in to the deep end to sink or swim when I joined the SUN. For, very soon after I joined, Dinoo Muthu-Krishna, the chief sub of the WEEKEND left for Australia and I was left nervously holding the shaky fort. But then as I paddled in unfamilair waters, Rex was always there with a lifeline. He taught without spoonfeeding, he gave ideas but shared the credit, and more than all, he instilled self-belief and confidence in me and all the other eager young ones who joined the SUN ranks soon after.
While the SUN was where Rex excelled in his task as Editor in Chief of a respected national newspaper, the WEEKEND was the playground where he unleashed his creative brilliance. It was as if every day he sat up thinking of new ways to make this Sunday edition of the SUN, more exciting, more dynamic, more reader-friendly, more value for money for its readers. Under his stewardship, the paper ran many competitions over the years. Each time he designed the logo himself. For the Spooky WEEKEND competition where readers were asked to send in their personal ghostly encounters, he designed a logo with the W of WEEKEND looking like an eerie bat.
Not satisfied with just coming up with this idea, he decided a prank was in order. Suddenly a mysterious envelope landed on the WEEKEND sub-desk. The other sub and I shrieked as we opened it to discover a voodoo doll of sorts made out of a candle, pins stuck on it for added effect! Rex had been hinting to us that the Rationalist Association was after us because we had started a ghost story competition so the doll was a ruse to make us believe the president of the Rationalist Association was after us! But of course we knew Rex was the mastermind because we could see him surreptitiously watching the fun through the glass in his room!
Talking of such capers, each year Rex thought up some crazy but ingenious April Fools Day prank in the newspaper that had hundreds of people fooled. His creativity knew no bounds. He wrote several columns under the names Suryakumara, Don Mithuna, Subodhini, and when regular columnist Amitha Abeysekera left to join the new rival The Island, Rex dug into his creative resources to come up with his very own Ibsen's Choice cartoon where an old tortoise dispensed nuggets of wsdom and wit!
Rex also started investigations into social ills, departmental bureaucracy and ministerial misdemeanours with the INSIGHT investigations in the WEEKEND. He also started the Action Sun column where readers wrote in with problems they faced with bureaucracy and the newspaper would talk to the relevant parties and find redress. He was the first to have an astrologer answer queries from the public and the WEEKEND desk was flooded with hundreds upon hundreds of hosroscopes and queries. At one time he discussed with me a column on the lines of Britain's Jim Will Fix It. It never got off the ground but years later when I was working at the Sunday Times and Junior Times, I 'borrowed' the idea to start 'Dreamboat' where children told us what their dream was and we turned it into reality. Soon after, I met Rex at a reception and he said, "So you took my WE (WEEKEND) will fix it idea? But that's ok, at least someone did it!"
Rex was not just a brilliant journalist he was a man with a soft heart. He felt for the poor, the needy, the wronged and the disadvantaged. He also cared deeply for his staff. I remember us girls and boys putting money together to buy him a gift for his birthday. After much shopping around (we did a lot of that at the Sun!), we found a decanter and glasses on a turntable that played music. The next day we presented it to him but I got told off for "letting all these young girls and boys spend their money." But the next morning he had a story. That night, while his children slept, he had taken the gift out to show his wife and the tinkly music had played. In the morning, he said laughing, his little sons had asked, "Thaththa, eeye re fairies aawada?" (Dad, did fairies visit last night?)
There are so so many memories of Rex that could fill a book. Rex encouraging me to write editorials, Rex nominating me for fellowships, Rex relating hilarious yarns, Rex dropping us home late on a Friday night as we hung about waiting for an office vehicle, us WEEKEND subs having lunch every Saturday with Rex at 5 pm, Rex sending us off to Pagoda to buy pineapple gateux for his birthday.. and on a more personal note, the doorbell ringing on the morning of my wedding and a shorts-clad bride opening the door to find Rex on the doorstep with a big box!.... the memories keep flooding.
Each and every one of us who passed through the doors of Independent Newspapers and learnt our craft from Rex will feel this terrible loss. Others no doubt will share their own memories of our dear, departed boss. I'm glad however that in the last few years Rex was a big part of the Sun/Weekened facebook group where ex- SUN alumni had re-grouped and we were once again enriched by the wisdom and kindness of our Editor. Even after all these years, he continued with his encouragement. When he knew I was writing a biography of Lasantha, he sent a message giving me courage and later wrote, "I started reading your masterpiece this morning after downloading it from Amazon. I am now at Chapter 2 where you have chronicled his entre to journalism. Quite nostalgic to read about him and the old colleagues. How can you have such a photographic memory! In all, you have done a great job to fortify the memory of this magnificent journalist."
Rex was too humble to acknowledge that it was he who started off Lasantha's journey ino "magnificent" - and that of so many other SUN journalists who are doing great things with their lives.
Thank You Rex for moulding me into who I am. I will be eternally grateful. You are a boss none of us will ever forget because we are what we are because of your training! I speak for myself and all my colleagues when I say that we are so fortunate to have had our journalistic experience with you. Just as you once wrote, may you "always be born a scribe in samsara."
For us, the SUN has finally set.
