Water supplying project in Tambuttegama suspended

 
Anuradhapura District Secretary R.M. Wanninayake said today that a decision has been taken to temporarily suspend the drinking water supplying project in Tambuttegama following the protest held by farmers  in the area on Wednesday.
He said that decision was taken at a meeting held between protestors, Officers from the Department of Irrigation and National Water Supply and Drainage Board (NWSDB), on Wednesday.
National Water Supply and Drainage Board officials  emphasized that this project was implemented with bona fide intention of providing clean potable water to the people in the area where high prevalence of chronic kidney diseases were reported.
The officials said that farmers staged a protest damaging the public properties without having a clear understanding of the project and the farmers had thought that the water provided to agriculture purposes would be curtailed due to this project.
