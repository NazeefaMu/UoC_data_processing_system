Eleventh Korean Speech Contest

The 11th Korean Speech Contest organised by the Korea International Cooperation Agency (KOICA) Office in Sri Lanka, was held on October 13 at the Colombo Public Library's auditorium.
Additional National Policies and Economic Affairs Ministry Director-General N.R. Anees, KOICA Office Director Lee Dong Ku and other dignitaries participated in the event. There were around 12 candidates this year. A Korean culture expo and K-culture video displays were also part of the event. “Sri Lankan youths who learn the Korean language and understand Korean culture can help enhance the close relationship between the two countries,” Director Lee said.
The contest is held annually as a part of a KOICA volunteer programme aimed at strengthening Sri Lanka’s human resources, as well as connecting the cultures of the two countries. There are more than 50 KOICA volunteers serving at colleges and universities island-wide.
