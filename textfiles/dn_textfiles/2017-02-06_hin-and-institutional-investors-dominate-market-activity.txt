Point of view
Equities hit a 10-month low this week closing 20 points lower than a major support level (6135 points) against which the Broad-share index was consolidating over the last 3-weeks.
Skittish investor sentiment along with minimal retail activity dragged indices lower, but HNI and Institutional investors made a strong return this week as they accumulated mid-caps such as ASIR (39% of crossings), and blue-chips such as HHL (16% of crossings), HNB and JKH (10% of crossings) and COMB (4% of crossings).
Crossings over the week consequently amounted to ~58% of the week’s total turnover (cf. ~25% last week and ~67% the week prior) helping push daily average turnover levels 44.2% higher over the week (to LKR 0.69Bn).
Foreign investors meanwhile, reverted back to a net buying position, with inflows of LKR 108.6Mn helping pare down last week’s net outflows of LKR 285.0Mn.
Meanwhile, initial corporate earnings for the quarter ended Dec’16 has been mixed with ~ 59% of the 41 companies who have reported earnings thus far recording year-on-year growth in earnings.
With earnings releases gathering pace over the next few weeks, Markets are likely to cues from the overall direction of the earnings.
Equity markets in the week ahead are also likely to look to next week’s Monetary policy meeting (the 1st of the 8 meetings scheduled for the year) for future direction.
Cumulative 10 month B-o-P improves
The Balance-of-Payments (B-o-P) during the first 10 months of 2016 improved to a deficit of $273.6Mn relative to a deficit of $ 2.4Bn in the comparable period in 2015 (deficit of $1.5Bn for full year 2015*).
Import expenditure over the period remained largely flat (+0.2% Y-o-Y) as imports of consumer goods fell 9.2% Y-o-Y) led by declines in Vehicle imports (-42.8% Y-o-Y).
Imports of intermediate goods meanwhile, fell 1.3% Y-o-Y over the 10-month period led by declines in Fuel imports (-15.7% Y-o-Y).
However, fuel imports over the month of October rose 10.9% Y-o-Y with refined petroleum imports increasing 14.4% Y-o-Y due to higher thermal power generation over the latter half of 2016.

Imports of investment goods too, rose over the 10-month period (+13.2% Y-o-Y) with a notable increase in October (+52.2% Y-o-Y) due to the importation of a dredger vessel by CHEC Port City Colombo (Pvt) Ltd.
Exports over the 10-month period meanwhile, declined 2.6% Y-o-Y helping push the country’s trade deficit 3.7% Y-o-Y higher over the period.
Nevertheless, steady service and financial flows helped ease pressure on the overall B-o-P position over Jan-Oct with stronger tourism earnings (+14.6% Y-o-Y) and steady worker remittances ($5.9Bn) along with easing net outflows from G-Sec ($109.2Mn cf. $1.0Bn in 2015) and fund from ISB issuances and long-term loans helping financial flows.
