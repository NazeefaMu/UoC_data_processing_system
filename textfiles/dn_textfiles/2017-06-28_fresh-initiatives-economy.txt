Fresh initiatives on economy

After several eventful weeks in a row, the past week was somewhat of an anti-climax in the local political scene. With the troubles in the Northern Provincial Council seemingly out of the way for the moment, attention was once again turned to the SAITM (South Asian Institute of Technology and Medicine) issue.
Public anger was rising against the Government Medical Officers’ Association (GMOA) doctors for organising an indefinite strike amid a huge dengue outbreak. Worse, they were striking in support of an unruly mob of students, from the Inter University Students Federation (IUSF) who had stormed the Health Ministry premises, damaging buildings and vehicles in addition to virtually holding the staff hostage. Several arrests have been subsequently made, but the question remains as to who is going to pay for the repairs.
As far as we know, there is no law in Sri Lanka which allows for collecting the damages from the perpetrators (except in certain traffic incidents that cause damage to public property such as telephone poles). So the chances are that the repairs will be funded by the public. Ironically, the public had already funded the education of these youths and they are again being taxed, literally, to effect repairs to the Health Ministry. Many have commended the Government for deciding that government jobs will never be given to identified perpetrators who are found guilty of causing damage to public property.
While the GMOA will not admit it, the viral video clip of the doctor who was caught red handed doing private practice even as the strike was going on, caused a severe embarrassment to the organisation. The doctor made things worse by running across the road to reach the hospital. In another viral video clip, a relative of a patient was seen pointing fingers at doctors and warning them of dire consequences should anything happen to the patient. The GMOA later earned more flak for having booze and dancing girls at their AGM. Unfortunately for the GMOA, several cameramen from leading TV stations had videoed these moments which were shown on prime time news bulletins.
Foreign professionals
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe
Nevertheless, when a reporter asked a GMOA official whether it was appropriate to dance and pay homage to Bacchus when the whole country was engulfed in dengue, he sarcastically replied “should we cry then? (Api Andannada?)”. This too did not go down too well with the public. The GMOA would have also received a shock at seeing a banner headline in a Sinhala newspaper (not of the Lake House Group) which proclaimed that the Government was considering bringing in 5,000 doctors from overseas to tide over the health crisis. Although the report was unsubstantiated and the Government had clarified it had no intention of bringing in foreign professionals including doctors, it nevertheless caused ripples within the local medical community. By this time, the GMOA had got a hint that the “indefinite” strike was clearly untenable in the long term.
The GMOA had wanted a meeting with President Maithripala Sirisena, which was duly granted because the President and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe were keen to resolve the SAITM issue and restore normality to university education. Accordingly, the Government reached an agreement with the GMOA based on five main points. The five-point agreement comprised suspension of new admissions and issuing of degrees until SAITM met all conditions, gazetting minimum standards in respect of medical education, Sri Lanka Medical Council (SLMC) to be free of interference, curricula of SAITM students to be in line with SLMC standards and to work out a system to those who had received degree from SAITM to receive SLMC registration and lastly to obtain the Attorney General’s advice before the Government informed the Supreme Court regarding its stand. Measures would be also taken to run SAITM as a public-private partnership while the Government was in the process of taking over the hospital owned by SAITM. The Government would also examine the possibility of listing SAITM in the Colombo Stock Exchange or establish a public/private fund, he said. The Secretary to the President, P B Abeykoon, said the Government was ready to address any other issues in addition to those mentioned above.
The GMOA said that they had reached an understanding on four matters:
1. Expedite legal measures to stop fresh admissions and issuance of degrees.
2. The Attorney General to inform the Supreme Court regarding the Government’s stand on SAITM.
3. President Maithripala Sirisena guarantees the independence of Sri Lanka Medical Council (SLMC) President Prof Carlo Fonseka and his colleagues.
4). Initiative to resolve the crisis caused by SAITM in a way not inimical to the people.
The GMOA later said a statement issued by Secretary to the President has violated the agreement they reached with the President, adding that they retained the option of resuming trade union action. It remains to be seen whether they will keep their word.
The other controversy that was raging in the mainstream and social media – the arrest (or the lack thereof) of Venerable Galagoda Aththe Gnanasara Thera of Bodu Bala Sena (BBS) fame came to an end when he surrendered to the Police. Since the Police did not object to the granting of bail to the Thera, the courts had no option, but the Magistrate made her displeasure known to the Police. She pointed out that the law must be equal to all and the Police could lose public confidence if different people are treated in different ways.
Speaking at a religious ceremony, Justice Minister Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe castigated those who had accused him and Minister Patali Champika Ranawaka of providing refuge to Venerable Gnanasara Thera. He charged that certain NGOs ‘hell bent on sabotaging reconciliation’ were behind these stories aimed at sullying Sri Lanka’s reputation in the eyes of the international community. Speaking at a religious function on Monday, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe too emphasised the importance of fostering racial and religious amity. President Sirisena, who too spoke at the same ceremony, said it was disheartening to notice many attacks on the Maha Sangha and religious dignitaries on social media sites such as Facebook. These vicious attacks could spur discord and rancour among different communities, he warned. Incidentally, MP S.M. Marikkar won praise from the Most Venerable Dr Bellanwila Wimalarathana Thera for attending this Buddhist function on Ramazan day, thus showing how reconciliation should be practised in real life.
The Justice Minister figured in at least one other matter last week. He had criticised lawyer Lakshan Dias for making statements which he perceived as being against the State. This matter figured at the Bar Council meeting held on Saturday presided over by the BASL President U R de Silva.
Garbage issue
President’s Counsel J C Weliamuna raised the matter and said that Dias is being persecuted for a statement he made over the electronic media. He said that Minister Rajapakshe is pursuing the matter and wants him to be disenrolled as an Attorney-at-Law. Weliamuna said this move to disenroll him should be condemned. Former BASL President Geoffrey Alagaratnam also joined Weliamuna to condemn this move. However, W Dayaratne PC and Hemantha Warnakulasuriya argued against. The argument had apparently taken religious lines. At this stage, de Silva said he would dispatch a letter to Dias asking him to elucidate his statement by affidavit. The lawyers who stood for Dias said U R de Silva’s decision does not reflect the view of the Bar Association and the Bar Council, noting that it was an individual decision by the BASL President.
We are still not completely out of the woods vis-à-vis the garbage issue, but Minister Patali Champika Ranawaka explained to the media an elaborate master plan to process garbage at Puttalam. This, he said, will be a long-term plan with full recycling capability for paper and plastic. In the meantime, the clearance of garbage in many areas has been accelerated. The garbage issue has also been extensively discussed at several Cabinet meetings in a row.
The controversy over the handing over of the two lotteries boards to the Foreign Ministry shows no sign of dying down and Foreign Minister Ravi Karunanayake convened a news conference to explain the decision. He pointed out that several other seemingly mismatched ministries exist, with hardly any complaints from anyone. He lashed out at some of his detractors, saying some of them had lost out on lucrative lottery printing deals and were now gunning for him. The minister later visited the Chief Prelates of Malwatte and Asgiriya Chapters to seek their blessings.
His predecessor and present Finance Minister Mangala Samaraweera too met the Most Venerable Chief Prelates in Kandy. Just a couple of days earlier, he had made a somewhat controversial statement in Parliament, which he admitted was strictly his own opinion, on the possibility of reducing the prices of soft liquor including wine and beer with the aim of veering drinkers way from moonshine, known as Kasippu in local parlance. This is indeed a noteworthy proposal and had been tried once before during the previous People’s Alliance administration before various circumstances forced it to restore the status quo on high liquor taxes. The Minister then waded into hotter waters questioning the rationale of keeping Poya Days dry, given that drinkers are known to hoard the hard stuff the previous day. He indicated that there should be a shift in this policy, at least for the travel and tourism sector in the light of booming tourist arrivals.
Most experts agree that a mechanism should be found to drive people away from moonshine, due to the huge burden on the free healthcare system and the loss of revenue to the Government, as moonshine producers do not pay a red cent to the Government in the form of taxes. Although the minister did not mention it, some politicians on both sides of the House have previously called for legalising Kasippu so that the producers can be taxed. There was no opposition per se top the Minister’s speech in Parliament, with Joint Opposition firebrand Bandula Gunawardena calling for a wider debate and consensus on a viable liquor policy. However, his de-facto leader former President Mahinda Rajapaksa criticised the Minister’s speech at a public function. In any case, a process of wider consultation including discussions in the Parliament and the Cabinet are expected before any changes are made.
Most outsiders have little or no idea about what goes on in Cabinet meetings until they are given bits and pieces of information at the Cabinet news briefing, which is to be telecast live soon. In fact, the Cabinet and Consultative Committees in the Parliament are two places where a lot of work gets done. Last week, the Cabinet was busy going through several Cabinet papers of critical importance.
One of the most significant proposals was from the Prime Minister for the establishment of a ministerial committee to coordinate UN Human Rights Council recommendations. Noting that several ministries and institutions were currently engaged in these initiatives, this will be a central coordination and monitoring mechanism for the said initiatives. The Committee is expected to be chaired by Prime Minister Wickremesinghe and will include around six or seven other ministers including the Foreign Minister. A sub-committee comprising their ministry secretaries will assist the committee.
Sri Lankan economy
The Cabinet was also presented with a proposal for an Active Liability Management Bill, which will enable the raising of loans in or out of Sri Lanka for the purpose of active liability management to improve public debt management in Sri Lanka. This will give more leeway to the Finance Minister to raise any sum of money by way of a loan whether in or outside Sri Lanka in terms of the relevant laws. Coincidentally, the Cabinet also got a look at the current status of negotiations on proposed Free Trade Agreements with China and Singapore.
The Cabinet was also informed of a Proposal to establish an offshore Sri Lanka Rupee bond programme by the International Finance Corporation, the private-sector lending arm of the World Bank. The proceeds are to be used for IFC projects in Sri Lanka. The bonds will be sold in the international market to international investors, signalling greater confidence in the Sri Lankan economy.
Last week’s Cabinet meeting also saw a proposal for several amendments to the Value Added Tax (VAT). Among the proposals are: removal of Simplified Value Added Tax (SVAT) scheme; legal provisions to refund the VAT paid by foreigners on their spending in Sri Lanka, as practised in the UK and Australia; exemption of goods and supplies such as infant milk powder, books and magazines; renewable energy goods, certain electrical goods, energy saving bulbs, childcare services and several other categories. This shows that reducing the CoL is uppermost in the Government’s mind despite the attention paid to a myriad of other issues that have gained prominence recently.
