Foreign medical education costs Rs. 132 b annually: Rajitha

Sri Lankan medical students spend Rs. 132 billion to obtain medical education from foreign universities annually, Health Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne said.
According to Dr. Senaratne, all Sri Lankan students who qualify to enter state medical faculties cannot be given an opportunity to do so and only 17 percent of them can be taken into state medical faculties. The rest of the 83 percent do not get the opportunity to enter into a state medical faculty and become a doctor.
He was addressing a ceremony held in Colombo recently to hand over appointment letters to health sector employees. Dr. Senaratne said, out of this 83 percent, three percent can be taken a by a private medical faculty.
It should not be stopped. It should be assisted with aid. The Government is in the process of developing state medical faculties. Hostel facilities will be given to all medical students by 2018. Some are trying to change the attitude of the new employees who joined the health service recently.
They try to preach socialism to them, but that socialism is not preached by late Karl Marx. The ethnic conflict irrupted in 1956 could have been solved easily, but it turned into a war. Patriotism preached today is a disease, he added.
