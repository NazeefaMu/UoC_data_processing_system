“I thank Minister Rishad Bathiudeen for all the support he has given to sustain Indo-Sri Lanka relations. India always believed skills are the real strength. ITEC, started in 1964, has been an important component in India's development partnerships,” High Commissioner Singh said. “Importance of acquiring right skill-sets have gone up in today's knowledge based societies. ITEC offers technical training, consultancies overseas and feasibility studies. Almost 280 course are conducted annually and they are offered to more than 160 countries all over the globe. Certain programs are response oriented. Sri Lanka is one of the most important ITEC partner countries. We have seen enthusiastic participation from Sri Lanka with almost full utilization of the allocated ITEC slots. We increased ITEC slots allocated to Sri Lanka from 225 to 370, starting 2016. ITEC is not just about human resource development or capacity building and more than bilateral techno economic partnership-It looks at preparing ourselves to face the world together.”

In this background we place great importance to human resource and skills development.”
