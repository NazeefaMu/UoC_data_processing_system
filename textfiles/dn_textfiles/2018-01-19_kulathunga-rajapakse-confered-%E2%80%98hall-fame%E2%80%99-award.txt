Kulathunga Rajapakse confered  with ‘Hall of Fame’ award

DSI Samson Group Managing Director Kulathunga Rajapakse is no stranger to Sri Lanka’s industry and entrepreneur circles. As Managing Director of the DSI Samson Group, the country’s premier business conglomerate and leading manufacturer of footwear and bicycle tyres in Sri Lanka, he overlooks 32 companies while occupying patron level positions in National organizations for industries.
His invaluable contribution in shaping Sri Lanka’s industry economy and leadership in addressing key issues on behalf of entrepreneurs gained recognition recently at the 22nd Sri Lankan Entrepreneur of the Year Awards organized by the Federation of Chambers of Commerce and Industry of Sri Lanka (FCCISL). Kulathunga Rajapakse was awarded the lifetime ‘Hall of Fame’ award by President Maithripala Sirisena.
When asked what it meant to win the ‘Hall of Fame’ award, Rajapakse stated that the award stood as a statement to his contribution to the industry and thanked the FCCISL for choosing him as its recipient.
Describing the beginnings of the DSI Samson Group, the Managing Director explained, “From our very inception and throughout the development of DSI, we have continuously transformed challenges into opportunities and taken risks by venturing into territories others have not considered. These two features have been our keys to success. Our first factory was established in 1962 to overcome the restrictions posed by the Government on imports.”
“Nonetheless, this challenge led us to re-look at our own products, the productivity of our manufacturing lines by increasing the TAT, as well as our designs, since we had to compete with foreign products. It was actually a blessing in disguise because we improved significantly during this time”, said Rajapakse.
In 1980, a new brand Ranpa was born as a result of the political threat faced by the network within the electorate and the Business Acquisition Act. Rajapakse explained how the company considered moving out of the electorate and founded a new footwear manufacturing plant in Colombo, under a different name and a new Board of Directors.
This threat resulted in the DSI Samson Group enjoying a higher import quota and a substantial share of the market as both factories were manufacturing the same product. The organization also launched their very own ultra-modern Design Department, to tackle increasing competition.
“Strategically we practice umbrella branding through our corporate brand, DSI. This enables us to defend the market segment. Individual and sub branding is used for our diversified products. Our CSR brand remains ‘Samson’, in honour of our founder and Chairman, my father, the late D. Samson Rajapakse. We also have international brands such as Fila, Clarks, Puma, Reebok, Raleigh, Jac, Garware, Vardhaman, Next and Migrow, from all industries. These enhance our brand portfolio”, replied Rajapakse to a query about DSI’s maintenance of its consolidated brand image.
The veteran businessman believes that Sri Lanka has enormous potential but is not interested in creating a conducive environment for entrepreneurs. He explained that the present banking system, though one of the most developed in the region, still prefers financing the trading sector to industries.
The Managing Director of the DSI Samson Group was adamant in his belief in the importance of the presence of start-ups for the development of the country’s economy. “Start-ups and advocating of entrepreneurship from the initial stage are very important to the industry economy of any nation. New entrants face many challenges, as there are no venture capital agreements or rebates provided by the government. The development of technology has to go hand-in-hand with this, since we are in a world that is governed by ICT.”
