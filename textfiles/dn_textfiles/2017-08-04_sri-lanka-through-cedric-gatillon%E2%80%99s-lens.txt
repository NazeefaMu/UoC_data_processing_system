Sri Lanka through Cedric Gatillon’s lens

The French embassy and the Alliance Française de Kotte in partnership with Black Cat Café welcome the French photographer Cedric Gatillon for an exhibition dedicated to Sri Lanka, at the Black Cat Cafe from August 15 to 25 from 8 am to 10 pm.
The artist presents a series of photographs taken during a recent stay in Sri Lanka. They try to capture the ordinary life of Sri Lankan men and women, in their everyday work, and leisure activities. Cedric Gatillon combines formal composition and emotions in order to comply with the reality. However his pictures do not follow the traditional and academic codes of photo journalism. Cedric Gatillon wants the viewer to understand the peculiarities of this country apart from any political or symbolic message.
Cedric Gatillon is a contemporary freelance Graphic Designer and teacher with a unique and original voice. His multi-disciplinary, auteur-like approach blends his own photography and digital imagery with typography to express ideas and design solutions for a multitude of high end clients. His unique approach is the result of an international design education at L’École Estienne in Paris and then in London at Camber well College of Arts and Crafts.
Therefore Cedric Gatillon is not only a graphic designer and a teacher, he is also a gifted photographer.
