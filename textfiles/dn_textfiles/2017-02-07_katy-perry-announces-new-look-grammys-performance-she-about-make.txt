Katy Perry announces new look at Grammys performance: Is she about to make a comeback?

 
Katy Perry has excited her fans  by announcing a comeback performance at the Grammys and drastically changing her look.
Typically brunette, the star has dyed her hair blonde and gone for a pastel pink look.
The pop singer, who hasn't released an album since 2013, and the only offering since then has been her single Rise, which had a lukewarm reception by fans used to her previously steady stream of earworms.
Her work since then has mainly taken place off-stage, she's been on tour and spent the bulk of last year campaigning for Hillary Clinton.
Some have speculated she may use the Grammys to take a shot at President Trump, who she has consistently criticised.
However, others are hoping she returns to her music and uses the event to debut a new single.
