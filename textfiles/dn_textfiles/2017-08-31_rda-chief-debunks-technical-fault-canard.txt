RDA chief debunks technical fault canard

Rajagiriya flyover project:
Road Development Authority (RDA) Chairman Nihal Suriarachchi said that there is no technical or engineering fault with the Rajagiriya flyover project.
Addressing the media, he said work on the project is being carried out as planned in accordance with the design under the observation of the RDA.
“There is no fault relating to engineering, technological or construction aspects. The bridge will remain stable for 100 years,” he said while rejecting allegations that the Rajagiriya flyover was substandard.
According to him, the flyover is 363m in length. It will accommodate four traffic lanes. The Rajagiriya flyover is suitable for heavy vehicles also. Work on the project is nearing completion, he said.
Chairman Suriarachchi projected that the project could be commissioned by the year end; prior to the scheduled time frame.
He said two other flyover projects are being carried out by the same constructor at Polgahawela and Ganemulla Railway stations over the trailway track.
Work on the Rajagiriya flyover has been expedited to lessen traffic congestion at Rajagiriya junction along Sri Jayewardenapura Mawatha.
The flyover project was initiated by the Road Development Authority of the Higher Education and Highways Ministry in 2016 due to traffic congestion, which has long been a point of contention among the commuters.
The project is funded by the Government of Spain.
