France elects Macron as new president

France's next president is, let's face it, pretty youthful.
In 2010, David Cameron became the youngest UK prime minister since 1812 when he came to office at 43.
Barack Obama was also thought to be quite sprightly when he became US president in 2009 at the age of 47.
But Macron, at just 39, is much younger. Still, he has some competition in Europe.
In Belgium, Prime Minister Charles Michel was 38 when he became PM in 2014. Last year, Juri Ratas became Estonian PM at 38. In Hungary, Viktor Orban was just 35 when he became PM for the first time in 1998, and Greek Prime MInister Alexis Tsipras was 40 when he was first took office in January 2015.
What does Marine Le Pen do now?
At the party's campaign headquarters on election night, supporters carried blue-coloured roses, Marine Le Pen's favoured symbol.
The heavily defeated candidate even danced to I Love Rock and Roll (incidentally demonstrating that whatever presentational skills she possesses do not immediately transfer to the disco floor).
It may have been a strange way for a beaten presidential hopeful to spend the night, but this party has long term plans. Supporters will save their blue roses for 2022.
The face-off in France's cities
Emmanuel Macron - who defends internationalism, free trade and liberal values - was always expected to perform better in cities than Marine Le Pen.
Results show that in Paris, he won close to 90% of the vote. But he didn't perform better in all cities compared to his nationwide share of 66% - look at the results for the right-leaning French Riviera city of Nice, for example.
The Mediterranean south-east is seen as a stronghold for the National Front.
