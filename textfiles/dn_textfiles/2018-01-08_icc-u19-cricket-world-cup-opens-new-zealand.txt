ICC U19 Cricket World Cup opens in New Zealand

The ICC U19 Cricket World 2018 Cup officially got underway in style at the Hagley Oval in Christchurch on Sunday with an impressive ceremony showcasing New Zealand’s culture.
The ceremony was attended by representatives of all the 16 participating sides, Christchurch Councillor Aaron Keown, as well as New Zealand Cricket President Debbie Hockley, who, on behalf of the ICC and NZC, welcomed the teams to the tournament.
The tournament proper gets underway on 13 January with matches spread across seven venues in the cities of Christchurch, Queenstown, Tauranga and Whangarei. The winners will be crowned in Tauranga on 3 February. The teams will get a chance to get into their groove with practice matches in Christchurch from 8-11 January.
The squads, officials and other spectators present at the event enjoyed the short opening program, the highlight of which were traditional Maori dances. The cultural event was followed by photo shoots of participating teams in a festive atmosphere that saw the teams mingling with each other.
The teams attending the opening ceremony were enthusiastic about the event with the captains looking to make the maximum of the chances that come their way.
Sri Lanka captain Kamindu Mendis said: “We’ve never won the U19 World Cup and we think this (winning the tournament) will be a big boost for cricket back home. Our team is really good, are in good form and we really want to win it this time. We have some new plans and we did the right things in preparations over the past couple of months and have to now just do that in this World Cup.”
