Nabbed for possession of ammunition

A 40-year-old father of two was arrested by the Aranayake Police on the night of May 24 with a stock of live ammunition used for automatic weapons and handguns, a part of a firearm and a stock of spent cartridges, following a tip-off.
Police said the suspect, Koswatte Ralalage Chaminda Bandara Koswatte, a resident of Wattegedara, had hidden the stock in an abandoned house in a scrub jungle in Wattegedara. Investigations revealed that he is a technician.
Police wished to ascertain whether he manufactured firearms locally. On interrogation, he confessed that the ammunition had been brought home, from time to time, by his brother who was serving in the Army. His brother, however, had gone missing in 2000, while in the Army.
The suspect was produced before Mawanella District Judge and Magistrate L.K. Mahinda Liyanagama on May 26 and was remanded till June 5.
Further investigations are continuing, directed by Kegalle SP Chamika P. Wickremasinghe under the supervision of Sabaragamuwa DIG W.M.M. Wickremasinha.
