Kingswood upset Trinity to enter semis

Kingswood won their Milo ‘A’ division inter-schools President’s trophy rugby quarterfinal game when they shocked favourites Trinity College by 24 points to 15 at Nittawela on Sunday. At half time the winners led 14-8.
Kingswood kept alive their slim hopes of reaching the semi-finals after their good performance in the league. They beforehand promised a fierce, free-flowing encounter, and they proved it.
The winners underlined their dominance when there forwards played a superb game of rugby. Trinity too responded well, but Kingswood ensured the win. This clash was played in front of fervent fans. Both teams played the first 35 minutes at a fast pace but were unable to convert possession into points.
Credit should go to Kingswood’s defence; they really shut down and kept control of the ball. In the first half, though they didn’t fire too many shots they also found it hard to hold onto the ball for certain phases of the game.
The second half was a more open affair, but it was Kingswood in control and they were rewarded for it. The winning team did a nice job, they showed plenty of speed and skill.
The tries for Kingswood were scored by Janitha Rajanayake, Asiri Seneviratne, Dananjaya Nuwan and Sachintha Seneviratne. The conversions were done by Hirusha Sampath. For Trinity the tries came from Reshan Bandaranayake and Mahadi Abdullah. Minidu Jayasundera made the conversion and Akitha Sakalasooriya put over the penalty.
Kingswood will meet St Joseph’s College Colombo in the semifinals at the Sugathadasa Stadium on Saturday.
