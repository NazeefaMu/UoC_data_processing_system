'Thailand keen on strategic partnership with SL'

The 17th Annual General Meeting of the Sri Lanka - Thailand Business Council (SLTBC) was held at the Waters Edge, Battaramulla recently. It was held under the patronage of President of the Council Rizan Nazeer.
Ambassador Designate of Thailand to Sri Lanka Chulamanee Chartsuwan who graced the event said the Royal Thai Embassy would like to express its deep appreciation for the work done by the SLTBC and its able executive board to promote trade and investment between the two countries throughout the past two decades. Following is an extract from her address to Council members.
"I look forward to furthering the existing excellent relations with the Business Council to further win-win economic relations.
"In 2016, Thailand and Sri Lanka governments set a target to triple trade value between the two countries from presently US$ 500 million to US$ 1,500 million dollars by 2020.
"With this ambitious trade target set by the governments and with my strong economic background, it is not by chance that I have been assigned to be Ambassador to Sri Lanka today. Thailand Week with the first Thai Trade Fair organized in less than one month after I landed here. My mission is clear from Day 1.
"On the investment side, there is no set target. With the Thai investment value jumping 10 times from US$ 70 million in 2015 to US$ 700 million in 2016, mainly through the investment by Siam City Cement in Insee company, there is no reason not to expect much more investment from Thailand.
Just one very concrete example was another historic day in our economic relations when the Joint letter of Intent was signed between Sri Lanka's BoI and Rojana Industrial Estate to establish Milleniya Export Processing Zone in Kalutara District.
"This EPZ - Sri Lanka’s first industrial zone in over a decade - is expected to create 10,000 new jobs through 100 manufacturing operations and the number of manufacturers operating there is expected to double at a later stage when the EPZ is expanded from the initial 400 acres to 1,000 acres. It is hoped that the approval and construction of infrastructure, which usually takes five years, would be completed in one year and the project ready by end 2018.
"Thailand has already submitted a draft MoU on a strategic partnership with Sri Lanka. We identified in the draft MoU a number of areas of mutual interest. The next step is to develop a plan of action.
"By early September the Ministry of Primary Industry is going to sign a cooperation MoU with the Bank for Agriculture and Cooperatives and Kasetsart University, with a view to developing the primary industries in Sri Lanka through capacity building and knowledge sharing and to exploring the possibilities of obtaining credit lines to support the entrepreneurs engaged in exports and imports related to primary industries.
"Second, I have been instructed to follow up with the Sri Lankan side on Thai - Sri Lanka FTA negotiations. I have been in close contact with the Ministry of Commerce, which is responsible for this FTA negotiations.
"Third, I set as my mission to identify areas where Thai and Sri Lankan businessmen can trade and invest. The areas of agriculture and processed food, gems and jewellery, electronics, automative parts, rubber, hospitality including hotel management, alternative energy, are some of the areas floating between both sides.
"I pointed out to the Thai businessmen, and they agreed, that the competitive edge of Sri Lanka lies in its strategic location. Sri Lanka has rightly positioned itself as maritime hub for South Asia and this point offers strategic interest to the Thai business sector.
"That is why after two months of posting here, I have chosen my first B2B project with the theme of logistics. I brought a number of Sri Lankan companies to logistic trade fair called TILOG - LOGISTIX, as well as to Laem Chabung, our biggest port. Very soon I will lead embassy staff to visit the Hambantota Port and airport, to have a better appraisal of its potential.
"Second, with its small consumer base, Sri Lanka has been positioning itself as a gateway to South Asia through its bilateral FTA networks with South Asia. While this positioning is welcoming, investors might already compare the incentives and advantages offered here in Sri Lanka with those offered by neighbouring countries with much bigger population base. Therefore, investors are looking for cost effective labour, ease of doing business, easier tax structure, stronger incentives; in short, more business friendliness and confidence.
"Third, one Thai company gave me a homework and I would appreciate if anyone here could help me do this homework. The homework is – how can Thai investors work with their counterparts in Sri Lanka to access the market in Great Britain, probably through the Commonwealth scheme, now that Brexit is becoming a reality. Brexit is making a big transformation to trade between Asia, Thailand included, and Europe and my homework is how Sri Lanka can play a role in this transformation."
