Sculpture in style

The Sri Lankan Hindu temples, temple structures and inner temple designs almost resemble the ancient South Indian Hindu temples. Shiva worship is one of the foremost practices in this island nation. Sri Lankan Hindu tower temple sculptures almost resemble the typical South Indian Dravidian Hindu temple tower sculptures. South Indian Hindu temple architecture has its own excellence and exceptional unique structural style. It could be generally said that almost all the Sri Lankan Hindu temple sculptures follow the rich ancient Dravidian architecture.
It is inevitable that the famed Colombo Sri Ponnampalawaneshwarar temple Kochchikade was built following the same South Indian Dravidian architecture and South Indian Dravidian sculptural style. According to Sri Lankan Hindu temple history, this is the only Hindu temple in Sri Lanka which was built with granite alone. That's why this particular temple is often referred to as 'Kallu temple' or 'KalluKovil'. This implies that the temple was built with granite alone. Even the outside boundary walls of the temple, the skyscraper Kopurams (towers), Sanctum (Sanctorum) and outdoor of the Sanctum were made with strong granite slabs. Besides these, even inside the temple, separate different inner temples were also built for different deities, with granite alone.
Beautifully crafted
The inner top roof of the temple is also made of granite. Even the inner top roof is beautifully crafted, and carved with excellent figures which reveal the excellent and exceptional craftsmanship of the sculptors.
The diagram of twelve Rasi Chakarams is exquisitely depicted near the eastern entrance roof top. Besides, these various aspects are beautifully carved on the magnificent granite pillars. Most of the pillars are decorated with beautifully crafted reptiles, beautiful and different varieties of birds and big and small wild animals in different poses and stands. All these provide us ample evidence of exquisite handiwork of the sculptors. In simple words, we can say, by numerous ways the sculptors of this temple have contributed their whole might and efforts to beautify this temple into a cultural citadel.
Inside the temple, a plenty of granite crafted and carved sculptures are seen. Simply it could be said that this temple is decorated with beautiful sculptures. And these sculptures are seen on the temple walls, on the temple pillars, on the top of the pillars, as well as on the inner rooftops. Even the inner rooftops are also decorated with beautifully carved and crafted figures. On one pillar near the Navagragha temple, one could see 18 Tamil letters beautifully crafted.
We are privileged to see beautifully carved lions on each top of the tall majestically sculptured pillar. Each lion looks very calm and majestic. It is worthy to mention here that none of these single lions looks agitated anywhere else in the temple. Most of these lions are depicted in sitting position. Each lion's mouth is wide open. From the wide-open mouth of the lions, thick carved granite chains seem to be falling out. It implies the exquisite craftsmanship and the excellent sculptors' skill. Further from some of the lions' mouths, instead of carved granite chains, leafy creepers seem to be falling down from their wide-open mouths. All these sculptures reveal the exceptional imaginative creativity of the sculptors.
Saint KannappaNayanar's epic is well depicted on one of the temple pillars. Saint KannappaNayanar's devotion towards Lord Shiva is immeasurable. KannappaNayanar's epic clearly defines his sacred devotion and exceptional love for Lord Shiva. Saint KannappaNayanar, due to his overwhelming devotion towards Lord Shiva, in one incident had plucked and offered his left eye to the Lord.
Gypsy figure
Near the IsthambaMandapam, adjoining the right side steps, at the top of a pillar a gypsy woman's figure is beautifully carved. In other words, a gypsy woman's figure is beautifully depicted on one of the temple pillars.
This particular gypsy woman is holding a basket in her hand. It is remarkable and appropriate evidence which reveals the excellent nuances of Dravidian sculptors' handiwork. On the top of these sub inner temples, the devotees are privileged to have an opportunity to view numerous poses of Shiva Puthams (Goblins). The Shiva Puthams are decorating the pillar tops. Some of the Shiva Puthams seem to be bending their two legs and they are in resting positions. Meanwhile, some of the Shiva Puthams seem to be in sitting position and raising up their body.Above all these, the Eastern Rajakopuram and Southern AmbalRajakopuram of the temple towers are beautifully decorated with numerous sculptures. Further, these sculptures depict different puranic stories related to Lord Shiva and Goddess Parvathi.
In some Hindu temples, excellently carved musical instruments also could be seen. Unlike other South Indian Shivan temples, at Sri Ponnampalawaneshwarar Temple, Kochchikade, there is neither a single decorative dance pose of Lord Nataraja, nor a single decorative Thandava Karana pose of the Lord is seen. Similarly, even a single dance pose of a danseuse is also not seen.
Another noteworthy aspect of this temple is unlike other temples, no room is given for paintings or portraits. The temple gives more importance to the sculptures rather than paintings. All the Hindu temples are generally decorated with beautiful paintings related to different stories pertaining to the main presiding deities of the selective temples. Most of the Hindu temples are adorned with beautiful decorative sculptures of various Gods, dance poses of numerous gods and numerous female dancing figures.
Rooftop space
To get ventilation inside the temple, magnificently crafted granite windows were installed by the temple constructors. Initially, the constructors left some spaces on the rooftop in order to get sunlight and ventilation into the temple.
