Maliban Smart Cream Cracker awarded the Advertisement of the Year

Maliban Smart Cream Cracker has been awarded the Advertisement of the Year at the recently concluded SLIM-Nielsen People's Awards 2017 held at Water's Edge.
This was testimony to disruptive communication creating a lasting connect with consumers. “When developing this idea for Maliban Smart Cream Cracker, the task was indeed a difficult one. We needed to make a strong impression with the target segment in a category that is very competitive. Using disruption , our approach was to look beyond the conventions of the category and use a strong consumer insight. This has certainly paid off with this award,” said Subhash Pinnapola, Chief Creative Officer, TBWAi Lanka “We are honoured to have received such a recognition, especially given the category of communication where competition isn't just with biscuits but much larger.
This recognition drives home the fact that good communication makes a difference not only in growing market share but also the importance of touching the hearts of Sri Lankans” said Kasun Thotagamuwa, Category Manager, Maliban Biscuits. “A commercial to be voted by the people, as the most popular advertisement of the year is an honour. It is a testimony that we at TBWAi Lanka understand and resonate with our people. Consumers today are bombarded with so many brands and messages. To get their attention and share of heart with the Maliban Smart Cream Cracker “Anduna Gaththada Manda” commercial is indeed a proud moment” said Renuka Marshall, Managing Director TBWAi Lanka.
