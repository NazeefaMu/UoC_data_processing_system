Nearly 10 percent of urban youth use internet daily

Nearly 10 percent of Sri Lankan urban youth (more males than females) use the internet on daily basis.
Still, 23.5 percent of boys and 36.1 percent of girls lack the capacity to use the internet, Dr. Chiranthika Vithana attached to the Family Health Bureau said. Addressing a health seminar held at the Health Education Bureau in Colombo yesterday, she said that nearly 60 percent of Sri Lankan youths are equipped with mobile phones and about 10 percent of them had tried to use the same facility to develop relationships with unknown people. The statistics had been obtained through a recent study.
The study had also revealed that nine percent of youth use tobacco and 10 percent of youth use alcohol.
About 85 percent of sexually active youth had one sexual partner, while 7.2 percent had two. About 3.2 percent had three or more sexual partners. Estimated suicide rates are 23.7 per 100,000 with boys, having three times higher risk than girls.
About half of males and three fourth of females are having a sedentary lifestyle.
There are 3.3 million (16.4 percent of the total population of the country) youths (between the ages of 15 and 24) living in Sri Lanka at the moment.
It is considered that youth is the second formative stage of life after childhood; a period with growth, opportunities and challenges both physically as well as mentally, the study revealed.
