Mustapha to mediate in LG, UDA issue

Provincial Councils and Local Government Minister Faiszer Mustapha said he will seek a solution to the crisis pertaining to UDA’s initiatives to restructure its powers delegated to local authorities.
“I would like to play a role where I could put both parties together,” said the Minister speaking to the Daily News. He said the Provincial Councils complain that the powers have been taken away by the UDA and the UDA claim they have a right to do so.
“At this point I will not express my personal views being the bridge between the periphery and the centre. I believe that I can solve this through cordial discussions,” he said. The Minister said he had discussions with the Megapolis and Western Development Ministry.
“I am having a forum on March 27 where all Chief Ministers will participate and I hope to discuss this issue in full. Under this government there is nothing that cannot be solved through discussions,” he said.
