Gamperaliya investment is unparalleled: Mangala

The total investment for the Gamperaliya programme is unparalleled when it comes to financial allocations for short-term rapid rural development projects in the country, Finance and Mass Media Minister Mangala Samaraweera said.
The Minister was speaking at the inauguration ceremony of the renovation of an irrigation canal in Madiha, Matara.
The Minister said the government through Gamperaliya will take immediate measures to accelerate economic growth by improving the infrastructure facilities and to develop the livelihood of the rural people.
The Minister said Gamperaliya brings fruits of development directly to the village in a short time.
“All electoral divisions will receive equal benefits under the programme. Each Divisional Secretariat has been provided with Rs.200 million for development work in 2018 alone. Through the budget we will allocate more funds for village development,” he told people.
“I am not a minister fond of laying foundation stones. I heard that several foundation stones had been laid to renovate this canal, but nothing happened. That is how the past rulers misled the people in the name of development.
They spent millions to build massive roads in Hambantota where only two or three vehicles ply in an hour. They did not care about village development,” he added.
The Minister said the Gamperaliya programme will improve the living standards of the villagers and bring more money to the village.
He said the Gamperaliya will fast-track rural development of irrigation, rural roads, schools, sanitary facilities and playgrounds, Sathipola, green park, electricity, renovation of religious and archaeological sites, housing development, issuing land deeds and entrepreneurship in all districts.
A large gathering and government officials and political representatives were present.
