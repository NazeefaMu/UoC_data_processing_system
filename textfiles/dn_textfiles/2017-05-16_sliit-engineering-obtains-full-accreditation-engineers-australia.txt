SLIIT Engineering obtains full accreditation from Engineers Australia

Achieving a significant milestone, SLIIT has become the first higher-education provider in Sri Lanka to receive full accreditation from Engineers Australia (EA), for the Bachelor of Engineering Honours Degrees awarded by Curtin University, Australia, delivered at SLIIT in Sri Lanka.
Engineers Australia is the leading engineering association in Australia, assuring that graduates of EA accredited degree programs meet international proficiency and competency standards. Graduates of EA accredited degrees are guaranteed membership with Engineers Australia. Accreditation provides a platform for the international recognition of engineering graduates, thereby ensuring their global demand.
SLIIT is now the only higher-education provider in Sri Lanka to conduct EA accredited Engineering Degrees. The degrees, conducted in partnership with Curtin University, Australia, are recognised by the University Grants Commission in Sri Lanka, under the Universities Act. The four-year Curtin Engineering degree programs offer specialisations in Mechanical Engineering, Civil & Construction Engineering, Electrical Power Engineering and Computer Systems Engineering.
Curtin University’s main Bentley campus is located in Perth, Western Australia, and provides undergraduate and postgraduate education for more than 53,000 students. Curtin University also ranks among the top 2 percent of universities worldwide, in the prestigious Academic Ranking of World Universities.
Students in Sri Lanka have the option of either completing the entire four-year Curtin Engineering degree in their chosen field of specialisation, at the SLIIT Malabe Campus, or completing 2 years at SLIIT and transferring for the remaining 2 years to the Curtin Bentley Campus. Students following the Curtin degrees at SLIIT are considered internal students of Curtin University and have the same access to the e-learning resources, such as the Curtin E-library, information databases and lecture materials, which are available to students studying at Curtin’s Bentley campus.
Prof. Saman Thilakasiri, Dean of the Faculty of Engineering at SLIIT, stated that SLIIT is proud to be the first in Sri Lanka to get full accreditation from Engineers Australia, giving Curtin University graduates of SLIIT, further international recognition as a result of the accreditation. A review panel from Engineers Australia, consisting of experts from the relevant fields of engineering, visited SLIIT in November 2016, and upon completion of a comprehensive review process, confirmed that the Curtin University Engineering Degree programs offered at SLIIT meet the required accreditation standards specified by Engineers Australia.
Assessment of the accreditation process is based on the teaching and learning outcomes, structure and content of the program, availability of physical facilities to conduct courses, academic staff strength, the quality assurance framework of the institute, industry collaboration and the employability of the graduates. As a result of the accreditation, Curtin University Engineering graduates from SLIIT can immediately apply for membership of Engineers Australia upon graduation.
