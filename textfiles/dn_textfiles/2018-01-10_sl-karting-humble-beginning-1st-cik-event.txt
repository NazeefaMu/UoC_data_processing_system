SL Karting, from humble  beginning to 1st CIK event

Sri Lanka will reach another milestone in motor sports when the country's first ever international Karting event will be conducted at the expanded Bandaragama Karting Circuit on January 13 and 14.
The event is sanctioned by the world Karting governing body, Commision Internationale de Karting (CIK) affiliated to Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile (FIA) and some of the world's top Karters will be in action at the IAME X30 Championship round in Sri Lanka.
Sri Lanka's oldest and only FIA affiliated motor sports club, Ceylon Motor Sports Club (CMSC) in association with David David Peiris Motor Company (DPMC) share the pride of hosting this milestone event in Sri Lanka on newly upgraded Bandaragama trakc which will now ready to host international standard Karting events. According to the organizers, the new track is truly spectacular and will offer a great challenge to the drivers.
Go-Karting (or Karting as it’s commonly known) is an entry level form of the sport which offers great thrills and challenges as the driver sits just millimeters from the ground, and compared to other forms of motoring, totally exposed to the elements.
Karting in Sri Lanka goes back to the early 1980’s when the CMSC brought down 6 karts from Bill Sisley in the UK.
Initially these Karts all had 125cc motor cycle engines, which with the kind help of the Cinnamon Gardens Police Station, were raced in a cordoned off area around Independence Square.
As interest in the sport grew, the CMSC decided to run two separate classes – one for the 125cc motor cycle engine Karts, the other for the internationally recognized class of 100cc 2 stroke. The latter was made possible with the assistance of Frank Perera who was then working in Oman, and this connection culminated in the CMSC inviting a team of drivers from Dubai to participate.
With no track to race on, the first option was the Car Park at Isurupaya, where the Ministry of Education was then housed.
Through the kind intervention of then Education Minister Ranil Wickremasinghe approval was obtained for the inaugural event.
Isurupaya continued to be the venue for a few more events, and thereafter the racing moved to the car park of the Taj Samudra Hotel, the BMICH, Pegasus Reef Hotel and what was Alcatras restaurant opposite the current Parliament building.
During this period, a team of Sri Lankan Karters were invited to participate in Dubai and the interest in Karting was growing amongst Sri Lankans.
With over 30 active Karts in play there was a dire need for a purpose built track, both for safety and for facilitating the sport.
One of the regular Karters at the time was Rohan De Silva, who took on the great initiative to build and operate the Speed Drome in Battaramulla. This location was a huge step forwards for the sport as there was finally a dedicated place for the sport. It’s pertinent to mention here that many F1 drivers have started their career in Karting making
this truly the cradle of Motor Sports. Incidentally Eshan Pieris who is currently a front runner in the Asian Circuits is one of those who began his racing at Speedrome. As many will know, we now have the Sri Lanka Karting Circuit at Bandaragama operated by the inimitable David Peiris of DPMC. Peiris is no stranger to the motoring fraternity in Sri Lanka.
