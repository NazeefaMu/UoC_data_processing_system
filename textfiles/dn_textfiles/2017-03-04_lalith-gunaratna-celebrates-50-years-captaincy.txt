LALITH GUNARATNA CELEBRATES 50 YEARS OF CAPTAINCY

Lalith will be visiting Sri Lanka on time to be present at the Ananda/Nalanda cricket encounter to celebrate 50 years of his captaincy of Ananda and his tally of 21 wickets in the Ananda/Nalanda series.
Would this be broken this year? Highly unlikely. Lalith and Channa Gunaratna were two great brothers who played cricket for Ananda and also served the motherland by joining the army and the Air Force respectively while continuing their cricket careers.
Lalith played for Ananda from 1963 and captained the team in 1967, Channa played from 1969 to 1971. Both were punishing left-hand batsmen and were also left-arm seamers. Their father, Late Douglas Gunaratna who was attached to the Lake House in a managerial capacity was a frequent visitor to the cricket grounds to witness the performances of his sons. Most memorable performance of Lalith as captain was his leadership to beat the strong St. Benedict’s outfit at Kotahena in 1967 by skittling the Bens for 22 runs in the second innings to end the match early on the second day.
In the same year on the 24th of January Lalith displayed his leadership qualities by beating a “cock a hoop” Thomian team, who thought they were unbeatable, the Thomians had a star studded team consisting of players such as David Ponniah, Ajith Jayasekera, Dennis Chanmugam, J.D.Bandaranayake ,P. L. D. Kariyawasamthese batsmen who had a copy book technique and the talent to match(these days called the software and the hardware) were utterly clueless against the wily spin of Lalith, who had a wide repertoire in his bowling armory such as orthodox spin, the arm ball which dipped in late, the chinamen and to cap it all he used the crease to good effect by using the width to fox the batsmen, I was a privy to all his bag of tricks because I used to stand at short slip.
The upshot to all this was Ananda won the match by 5 wickets by breaking a hoodoo. I must be thankful to Harischandra Gunaratna a Senior Journalist at “The Island” for giving me some details of the proceedings; then he was a 14 year oldboy studying at Ananda who watched this match.
