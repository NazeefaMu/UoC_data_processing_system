Southern Expressway opened

The Gelanigama-Dodangoda section of the Southern Expressway has been re-opened for traffic, a spokesman for the Expressway maintenance service unit said.
This section was closed for traffic due to heavy rains and the stormy weather recently. The Kadawatha-Kokmaduwa stretch of the expressway is also safe for vehicular traffic, the spokesman added.
