‘Sajith should be UNP’s PM candidate’

UNP Deputy Leader Sajith Premadasa should be nominated unanimously by the UNP Central Working Committee as the UNP candidate for Prime Minster at any forthcoming general election, if the party is to win, said former Kurunegala District UNP Parliamentarian and former Deputy Minister Ashok Abeysinghe speaking at a media conference at his residence in Kurunegala last week.
If the former Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe is presented by the UNP this time as its candidate for Premier, the UNP will record a sure defeat in the general election, he said.
“I told the higher UNP Central Committee members in 2010 that Sajith Premadasa was the most suitable candidate of the UNP for the post of Premier in this country. We are now ready for the general election after the declaration of the judgement by the Supreme Court with regard to the fundamental rights petitions. Ranil Wickremesinghe has been functioning as leader of the UNP for over 25 years. The present UNP needs reform and a change in its leadership. Therefore, he should now give the UNP leadership to the Deputy Leader Sajith Premadasa to lead the party towards victory,” Abeysinghe said.
