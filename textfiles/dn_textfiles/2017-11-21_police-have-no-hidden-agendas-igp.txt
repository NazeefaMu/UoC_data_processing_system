Police have no hidden agendas - IGP

Sri Lanka Police do not have hidden agendas. It has the state agenda to serve dutifully for the public of the country Inspector General of Police Pujitha Jayasindara said in Galle.
He was addressing the special forum of the Civil Security Committee members , officers of Community Policing Unit lead by religious dignitaries of Galle Police Division held yesterday at Galle Town Hall. It was a programme to raise awareness over the recent incidents of violence that took place at GIntota in Galle.
Police department does not work to elevate anyone’s personal image or to serve for the individual being of any person. We do not have hidden agendas. Nevertheless we have the state agenda to serve the masses of the country. We are obliged and bound for the execution that national agenda he further pointed out.
The IGP in assessing the lessons learnt from the recent communal unrest in Gintota, Galle said that the police including religious and community leaders and state officials failed in handling and controlling the progressing of communal violence in Gintota.
We have to be modest. We all failed. The incidents that occurred in Gintota are black mark for us all. However we have to correct our mistakes and deficiencies and reorganized all civil organizations to avoid happening of such disgraceful and shameful events in future.
Police should strive hard. I hope the participation of at least 25 members from each of the Civil Security Committees of the 8 Grama Niladhari Divisions that were connected to the last Weeks’s incidents of violence. But the attendance is very poor. This shows that we fail in fulfilling our obligations. We have to understand the reality and modestly accept that we all failed in accomplishing our duties and obligations.
Patronizing one ethnicity or religion with maliciousness and on personal prejudice the incidents of violence are unavoidable. If we are interested only on our personal property and gains divisions among us are obligatory. Hence we have to think as one nation and one country. Our country is Sri Lanka and we are Sri Lankans.
The incidents of disunity occur out of brutality. Now we have concentrate on how to start afresh from the point where we failed. We have suffered more than enough owing to our inability to understand the social reality. The person who love the country, their family and their children cannot sponsored inhumanity.
Some sections of Social Media including certain national media also tried to inflame the communal unrest through spreading fallacious news. They tried to aggravate the situation working in par with certain vicious agendas. I urge all media institutions and media persons to work with responsibility for the national course of ensuring peace and harmony among all ethnic and religious groups of the country. Media is a national asset. They have a national obligation.
