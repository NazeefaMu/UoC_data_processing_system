ERROR OF JUDGEMENT

It is the duty of the government to maintain law and order and in a plural society like ours to prevent unlawful actions specially targeted against minority communities. This is particularly important to maintain the integrity of our plural State so that all the people can support it. But if a section of society feels that the government is not protecting them they will seek their own ways of protection in society. It is the duty of the government to maintain law and order and take action against all transgressors the law.
The government seems to be afraid of the Buddhist monks who are resorting to violent speech and action against the Muslims. But remember what happened to SWRD who allowed some monks to take the law into their own hands.
Crime against humanity
These Buddhist monks were perhaps men in yellow robes who are using the yellow robe as a cover to get immunity from the law enforcement authorities. It is very necessary to act against anybody and everybody who violates the law whether he is in yellow robes or not. If the government doesn't take timely and proper action to implement the existing law against incitement to disaffection they are paving the way for chaos. Prior to 1963 the administrative machinery and the Police enforced the law against incitement.
But SWRD and the SLFP interfered in the normal administration of the law and SWRD permitted hate speech to create disaffection among communities under the cover of allowing freedom of speech. He paid the price himself for unleashing unrighteous forces and undermining the rule of law scrupulously enforced previously by the Administration and the Police as inherited from the colonial power. This was a travesty of liberal democracy which is founded on the Rights of Man which cannot be abolished by majority rule.
These Rights are inherent to all human beings and hence the Muslims have these rights like the rest of us.
To violate their rights is a crime against humanity and the government cannot permit it by default of taking punitive action, in order to avoid incurring the displeasure of the majority Sinhala Buddhists who though passive and silent do not approve of such conduct by these monks.
They do not, however, voice their criticism against the monks whom they have been taught to respect in a feudal society.
The Prime Minister should act in terms of moral rights and respect the fundamental rights of all the people including the minorities. He is the Prime Minister of all and not only of the majority. In any case, he is a moral being and is bound by the moral law and such law overrides majority rule.
Majority support
His background and education are such that he cannot behave like an illiterate communalist. Remember the proclamation of the Rights of Man which came to be incorporated in the United Nations charter.
One hopes and prays that the Prime Minister and the government will act righteously as they are morally bound and such moral imperatives override the majority will.
The majority will is not always right and a ruler is required to follow what is right and morally justifiable and not merely the majority will where the majority will is opposed to what is morally right he cannot opt for what is morally wrong merely to retain his majority support. One hopes the Prime Minister and the government will have the moral courage to act righteously where such righteous conduct clashes with the majority will. In such circumstances, the leaders should guide the people instead of succumbing to their moral errors. One hopes we have upright and righteous leaders in the UNP unlike the populist SLFP of MR.
