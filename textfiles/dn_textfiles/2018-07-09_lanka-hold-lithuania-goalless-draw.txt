Lanka hold Lithuania to goalless draw

The first football match between Sri Lanka and Lithuania ended in a goalless draw in the friendly international tournament played at Racecourse yesterday.
Sri Lanka kicked off the match and in the first half the team from Europe Lithuania played very slow game. Sri Lanka were more concerned on the defensive side and also made some passing errors during the first half.
In the second half Lithuanian started their campaign with their forwards and attempted a goal attack but were foiled by the Sri Lankan heavy defense that spoiled all Lithuanian attempts.
Speaking to media head coach of Sri Lanka Pakeer Ali said: “Our team played well defensively especially when facing such a strong team like Lithuania. It’s a good opportunity for them to upgrade themselves.
This same team will be touring Japan tomorrow for another international tournament and our ‘B’ team will battle out with Lithuanian in their second match.” Sri Lanka’s last international outing was their participation at the inaugural AFC Solidarity Cup held in Malaysia in November 2016.
The Football Federation of Sri Lanka (FFSL) is staging the friendlies with the theme ‘International Football Is Back’.
