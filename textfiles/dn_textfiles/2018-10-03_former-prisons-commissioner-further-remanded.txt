Former Prisons Commissioner Emil Ranjan Lamahewa who was in remand custody over the Welikada Prison riot in 2012, was further remanded until October 16 by Colombo Additional Magistrate Priyantha Liyanage, yesterday.
Inspector Neomal Rangajeewa of the Police Narcotics Bureau is out on bail. On September 25, the Court of Appeal ordered the release of the suspect on bail taking a revision application filed by IP Rangajeewa into consideration.

Twenty-seven inmates were killed and more than 20 others were injured in the deadly shooting during the Welikada Prison riot on November 9, 2012 when prisoners took control of the prison objecting to an unannounced search by the Special Task Force to nab hidden arms, drugs and mobile phones at the prison.
