UN Chief welcomes resolution of political crisis

United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres in a statement on Thursday welcomed “the resolution of the political crisis in Sri Lanka through peaceful, Constitutional means, and applauded the resilience of the country’s democratic institutions”.
The Secretary General’s spokesperson, Stephane Dujarric in a statement also highlighted that the Secretary-General called on “all political actors to seize
the opportunity of the appointment of the new Cabinet to resolve outstanding political differences in the same spirit of respect for democracy and in the interest of the people of Sri Lanka”.
Guterres who has been closely following the political situation in Sri Lanka has since October released two statements with regard to the country- one on October 28 and another on November 1; which was a statement on the telephone call he had with President Maithripala Sirisena.
On both occasions he urged the country to resolve its political crisis in a peaceful manner, with respect towards the rule of law and human rights.
