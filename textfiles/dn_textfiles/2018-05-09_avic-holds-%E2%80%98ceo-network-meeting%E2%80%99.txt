AVIC holds ‘CEO Network meeting’

AVIC International Holding Corporation, a subsidiary of the Aviation Industry Corporation of China (AVIC) and a reputed Global 500 Company recently hosted the ‘CEO Network’ Breakfast Meeting at the Hilton Colombo Residencies recently.
The ‘Invitee Only’ meeting comprised of a discussion which was initiated by the Guest Speaker, Jörn Rohde, the Ambassador to the Federal Republic of Germany to Sri Lanka and the Maldives.
Rohde’s discussion was titled ‘Sri Lanka – German Relations and Sri Lanka’s Vision to be the Hub in South Asia’. His discussion was later followed by a Q&S session which paved the way for like-minded business minds to share insight and discuss about the potentials that Sri Lanka harbours in the country’s stance towards advancement.
Following the breakfast meeting, a raffle draw took place for the attendees and gifts were presented to the winners. AVIC Astoria Project Director, Zhang Bo presented the winners with prizes before the meeting wrapped up.
