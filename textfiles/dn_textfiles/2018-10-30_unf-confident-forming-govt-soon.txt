UNF confident of forming govt. soon

The United National Front (UNF) will set up a government with a two-thirds majority in Parliament with the support of several Parliamentarians, Akila Viraj Kariyawasam said yesterday.
Addressing a press conference at Temple Trees yesterday, he said they would also punish people who broke the law by acting in an undemocratic manner. Kariyawasam said the appointment of another person as Prime Minister when there was no vacancy for the post was against the Constitution, and added that they would establish a strong government which would prevent any obstructions to the development effort soon.
He said this change would not be far away and recalled how the no-confidence motion against Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe was defeated in Parliament. He also said they would conduct a protest campaign against the undemocratic government at noon today (October 30) at Liberty Roundabout, Colombo and invited the people to join it.
Kariyawasam said they would bring lakhs of people to Colombo to re-establish democracy once again.
