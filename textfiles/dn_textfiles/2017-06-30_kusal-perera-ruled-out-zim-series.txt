Kusal Perera ruled out of Zim series

GALLE: Sri Lanka’s hard hitting wicket-keeper batsman Kusal Perera is out of the current Zimbabwe series and is even doubtful for the series against India starting later next month.
“Kusal is out for the whole series against Zimbabwe. The physio says he will be out for at least 8-12 weeks. He is also touch and go for the Indian series. We will have to closely monitor him,” said Sri Lanka captain Angelo Mathews.
Perera picked up a hamstring injury during Sri Lanka’s seven-wicket win against India at the Oval during the Champions Trophy in England early this month. Meanwhile Mathews stated that he will not be bowling in Test cricket but has restricted himself to only ODIs and T20Is.
“I have not been given the green light to bowl. I will not be bowling in Test cricket but am looking forward to bowling in ODIs and T20Is,” said Mathews. “At the moment the medical team’s advice is that my workload has to increase for me to start bowling again.”
Mathews suffered from a calf injury ahead of the Champions Trophy opener against South Africa which he was forced to miss. He returned for the second game against India playing as a batsman. He has not bowled since his injury.
