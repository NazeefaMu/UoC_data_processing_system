GCE O/L exam
Difficulty in issuing NICs due to faulty applications

Commissioner General of the Department for Registration of Persons Viarney Gunatillake said his department has faced difficulties in issuing National Identity Cards for some students sitting the 2018 GCE Ordinary Level examination since certain NIC applications forwarded through schools had some discrepancies and shortcomings.
He requests schools to send in duly perfected NIC applications for students sitting the GCE Ordinary Level examination after reading and properly adhering to the relevant circulars issued in this connection.
Gunatilleke said that even though the Department hoped to issue nearly 350,000 NICs for students sitting the 2018 GCE Ordinary Level examination, it has been able to issue only about 60 percent of the expected amount due to this problem.
