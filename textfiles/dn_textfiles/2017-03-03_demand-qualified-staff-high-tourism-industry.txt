Demand for qualified staff high in tourism industry

The tourism industry will create a high number of employment opportunities in the near future for the youth in the country, but the lack of qualified staff is a major issue in the field, Tourism Development and Christian Religious Affairs Minister John Amaratunga said.
He was addressing a certificate awarding ceremony to 450 students who completed three-month hospitality training programme in Colombo yesterday.
The Tourism Development and Christian Religious Affairs Ministry in collaboration with the Sri Lanka Institute of Tourism and Hotel Management (SLITHM), Provincial Councils, and private hotel schools have started the three-month training programme to meet the employment needs of the growing tourism industry in Sri Lanka. The programme will provide staff needed for new tourist hotels coming up in the country. By the end of this year, around 6,500 will complete their training in the industry at the ministry.
The programme commenced under a 2016 budget proposal aimed at creating employments in the tourism sector. The Minister said a large number of hotels are being built and there will be a great demand in Sri Lanka and abroad for those who completed the training programme.
“We will bring four million tourists to Sri Lanka by 2020. The country recorded around 2.1 million arrivals for 2016 and we expect 2.5 million tourist arrivals this year,” the Minister said.
Reportedly, many hotel operators have expressed that they face difficulties in recruiting employees to fill their vacancies due to lack of qualified staff.
The Minister said several hoteliers requested him to allow them to bring down workers from the Philippines and China to work in hotels. “However, we have not agreed to this proposal, the Minister said.
The Ministry and the private sector are working together to train the workers for the tourism field. Those who completed the certificate course can join the degree programme conducted by the SLITHM. The employees in the hotel field earn high commissions and service charges in addition to their basic salaries.
