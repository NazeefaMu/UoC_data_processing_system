Personality development tips
It is very important for a person to develop his personality not only in official life but also in private life. For example, a person has to maintain a high standard as a husband, father, neighbour and also as a true citizen of Sri Lanka.
Efforts that may be taken to develop personality in office are listed below.
* Subject matter of the work and expectation of the management should be clearly understood.
* Adequate qualification and training are important. Learning has no age barriers etc. Knowledge should be improved according to the market trends.
* Strengths and weaknesses should be identified. Rectification of weakness itself is a way of strengthening. For example, computer literacy nowadays is very important. When a person is working in an era he must be fluent in that area language and culture as well. Never depend on others for translation/interpretation.
* Never avoid a problem but face it with courage. A Japanese proverb goes to say “If the job has to be done by you, it is pointless delaying it”.
* Never get disheartened when faced with losses. Analyse the situation and rectify same with courage.
* Allocate the work among the staff, so that absence of a member or group does not affect the work. Proper team work is essential.
* Allow the members of staff to have free discussion with you for better understanding. Never overrule them using your position.
* Appreciate the good work done by staff publicly. Criticize them privately. Never place a person in an embarrassing situation.
* Favouritism and discrimination, both have to be avoided. It will hinder improvement.
* Benefits accruing to the team should be shared by all (Say Bonus)
* Create a sense of humour. This will reduce tension in the work place. Cordial relationship with the staff will improve.
* Having tension is a weakness. Proper planning will reduce tension. When faced with sudden problem deep thinking could help to solve them.
* Create positive thinking and direct the staff in that direction. Take up the leadership with confidence.
* Never put the blame on others. “Heads I Win Tails You Lose” is a wrong policy.
* Express your views to the management, staff, even to the public at large, with confidence backed by knowledge and experience.
* Appearance plays a major role in personality development. Clean appearance, proper attire, well mannered speech are important. Do not use improper language especially in the presence of female members.
* Good health (Body and mind) is important. Proper exercise, diet, rest etc would help.
* Pay special attention to public opinion. Media reports should be carefully watched and corrective action taken. Never create hatred against those who criticize you.
Great leaders like Mahatma Gandhi, Jawaharlal Nehru, Winston Churchill, Dr. Colvin R. De Silva are the best examples of persons having stunning personality. In the cinema field Bruce Lee, M.G. Ramachandran, Rajinikanth, Kamalhassan may be named. There are several others in other areas as well.
