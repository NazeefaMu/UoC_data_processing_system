Referees Society refuses to assign officials
Wesley  College pays heavy price for hooliganism

The Sri Lanka Rugby Referees Society (SLRRS) yesterday decided not to assign any referees for future matches involving Wesley College at any level of rugby.
The SLRSS said that their referee Dinka Peiris received threats from spectators after the second round inter-school league rugby match between Wesley and Royal played on Saturday at Longdon Place.
At the end of the match which Wesley lost by a point (17-18) a section of Wesley spectators behaved in an unruly manner setting upon last year’s Royal College league winning rugby captain Ovin Askey, who was present as an official of the Royal College team.
Earlier the match was stopped for about 15 minutes as referee Dinka Peiris wanted Wesley fans to step away from the fence during the second half. Nizam Jamaldeen, chairman of Sri Lanka Rugby Referees Society (SLRRS) said. “We have decided to temporarily suspend assigning referees for Wesley matches.
SLRRS has also decided not to assign referees for any of Zahira or Maliyadeva College rugby matches due to similar incidents which took place in Maradana and Kurunegala last week.
“We have requested the Schools Rugby Association to take a firm decision because as the head of the Referees Association I am liable for the safety of referees,” Jamaldeen said.
Sri Lanka Schools Rugby Football Association were holding a meeting yesterday with regard to incidents related to unruly behaviour of spectators at school matches.
