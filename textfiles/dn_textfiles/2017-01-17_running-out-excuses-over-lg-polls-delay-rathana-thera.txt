Running out of excuses over LG polls delay: Rathana Thera

The government is delaying the Local Government Election and we are running out of time, having brought this Government into power, Senior Consultant to the President and MP Ven. Athuraliye Rathana Thera said.
Addressing a press conference at the Sri Lanka Foundation Institute in Colombo yesterday, he said Local Government bodies are running without people’s representatives over a long period. “There are suggestions that the LG Polls should be held according to the old system after the act is being passed in Parliament for the new system,” he said.
According to Ven. Rathana Thera, politicians are underestimating the people. “There is no excuse for the Government’s failure in delivering on what can be done without a two thirds majority or a referendum. The preferential votes system can be abolished and the proposed Audit Comission Bill and the Bill on Tender procedure can be brought and passed in Parliament,” he said. This is a Transitional Government. This is similar to a soft ball of clay. Anybody can change its shape.
“Some are now trying to change its shape according to their requirements. But we wanted to establish a regime where we can tell the regime openly if its treading on the wrong path. We demand the President and the Prime Minister appoint an Intellectual Committee immediately to make decisions on the country’s development,” he added.
