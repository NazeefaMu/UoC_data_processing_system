Meteor shower Quadrantid visible in Sri Lanka tonight

 
The Sri Lanka Planetarium said a shower of meteors, known as the Quadrantid, would be visible in Sri Lanka around 8-9 p.m. tonight or early tomorrow (4) morning.
Sky watchers may get a good view of the meteor shower between around 4-5 a.m. tomorrow, the official further said, adding that the meteors could appear anywhere in the sky.
“The Quadrantid is an above average shower, with up to 40 meteors per hour at its peak.
It is thought to be produced by dust grains left behind by an extinct comet known as 2003 EH1 - discovered in 2003.
The shower runs annually from January 1-5” she said.
This will be the first meteor shower in 2017, but more meteor showers are expected in April 22-23, May 6-7, July 28-29, August 12-13, October 7 and 21-22, November 17-18 and December 13-14 and 21-22 according to the Astronomical Calendar 2017 of Sri Lanka Planetarium.
