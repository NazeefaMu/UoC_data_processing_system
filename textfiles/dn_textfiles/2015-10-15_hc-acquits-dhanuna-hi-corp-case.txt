HC acquits Dhanuna in Hi-Corp case

The Colombo High Court yesterday ordered to acquit and release Dhanuna Tillekaratne from the HiCorp case, on the basis that the prosecution has failed to prove the accused guilty beyond reasonable doubt.
Tillekaratne had been charged under Public Property Act for aiding and abetting to cheat US$299,061.25 of public funds through the Hi-Corp Private Company Ltd by forwarding forged bid documents to the Sri Lanka Army for certain supplies to the Defence Ministry 2007-2008 after
convincing the Sri Lanka Army (SLA) to deposit the money while appearing as an agent of British Borneo Defence Company in Australia.
High Court judge *Devika de Livera Tennakoon ruled that evidence given by the witnesses representing SLA had denied the accused's involvement in preparing and forwarding forged bid documents to the SLA.
Counsel Asela Rekawa who appeared on behalf of the accused had made a request that his client be acquitted from the case because the witnesses in the case denied his client involvement in preparing and forwarding the forged documents.
Field Marshal Sarath Fonseka who was also made as an accused in the Hi-Corp case was acquitted from the case over a double jeopardy issue; where charges in the indictment in the High Court case were similar to that in the second Court Martial trial in which Sarath Fonseka was sentenced.
Thus no action could be instituted twice against an accused on the same charges.
