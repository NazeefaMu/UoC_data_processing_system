Villagers lament poaching at Huruluwewa

Huruluwewa villagers said that poachers had been killing wild animals using hakka patas at the Huruluwewa Forest Reserve, recently, villagers said.
Hakka patas is an explosive device which is a mixture of chemical compounds, together with lead and iron, which is usually inserted into a cucumber or pumpkin.
They said that as the tanks inside the forest reserve had run dry due to the prevailing drought, poachers had been able to kill wild animals seeking for water, effortlessly.
Villagers added that wild animal meat was being sold to traders in the Galenbindunuwewa area, whereas hakka patas is sold to poachers by the boutique owners in close proximity to the Huruluwewa Forest Reserve.
Certain villagers use firearms in order to protect themselves and their cultivations, and a number of them had been engaged in poaching activities, they added.
Villagers requested the relevant authorities to take measures to curb the poaching of wild animals.
