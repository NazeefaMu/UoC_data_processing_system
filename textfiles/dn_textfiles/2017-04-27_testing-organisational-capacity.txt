Testing organisational capacity

Every organisation exists only because of the people who are a part of it, and those people both shape and interpret the character and culture of the organisation. But creating and maintaining a high-performance culture is not easy in today’s turbulent environment and changing workplace.
An organisation that tries to stand still may not survive. In order to achieve long term growth, organisations need novel replacements, new products or breakthrough products. Successful organisations are generally effective in responding to evolutionary changes in business environment particularly the market and have the capacity to absorb innovation into organisational culture which lies at the heart of organisational innovation.
Culture defers from country to country and organisation to organisation. An organisation that does not understand its own culture is like a person without an identity. To encourage change and positive growth the first step is to analyze the existing culture. Even if an organisation is relatively satisfied with its culture, assessment is still important to provide a common language for a conversation about current culture, workspace, and direction for the future.
Culture creates a sense of order, continuity, and commitment that permeates every aspect of the organisation from how employees interact to customer perceptions. Culture is often difficult for an organisation to articulate, but its impact is far reaching and influences management process, product and services, employee motivation, attention and retention, productivity, reputation and ultimately the bottom line.
Good corporate culture
Organisation culture is what organisational members learn over a period of time as they solve problems of survival. It is the pattern of basic assumptions that have been evolved, discovered or developed by a given group as it learns to cope with its problems of external adaptation and internal integration. Culture also expressed through the organisation’s myths, heroes, legends, stories, jargon, rites, and rituals. Culture is social glue that binds members of the organisation together through shared values, symbolic devices and social ideas.
Good corporate culture is not accidental. Successful organisational cultures are intentional by design, and not the product of default or serendipity. High-performance organisations set, manage, and monitor culture to achieve strategic objectives. In order to meet the organisational objectives and achieve competitive advantage, all organisations are thriving to recruit highly performing individuals. On the other hand, individuals need supportive organisational culture to help them reach individual objectives.
The selection process, performance evaluation criteria, training and development activities, and promotion procedures ensure that those hired fit in with the culture, reward those who support it and penalize those who challenge it. Further, the action of top management and socialization methods play a particularly vital part in sustaining culture.
Several challenges stand in the way of becoming more innovative, including the need to meet financial expectations and continue or extend the life of existing products and services. The biggest challenge many organisations face is creating a culture that supports and embraces innovation.
Most cultures are fairly resilient and resist change. Even when the corporate outlook is dire, it can be difficult to change a corporate culture. Decreasing resistance to change is important because the attitudes of those within the organisation greatly influence the success of change. Change does not come overnight. Outperformers have developed their performance excellence systematically and in a disciplined manner over extended period of time. Creation of high performance culture requires ambition, vision and courage. Spiritual leadership can dramatically reduce negative feelings, emotions and conflicts that are often present in organisations.
 
Different communication channels
Leadership is a core factor of organisational culture. In organisations that have had innovation success, a good portion of the credit goes to CEOs with visionary leadership to demand innovation and the fortitude to invest the necessary resources for senior management time and energy in talent management. Knowledge management also plays a key role on performance improvement of an organisation. For an effective knowledge management that can support the successful processes of an organisation should be supported by the organisation’s culture.
As rational individuals, most of us do what we are compensated and motivated to do. If an organisation has a focus on cost cutting and process excellence, it is likely that the compensation schemes encourage and reinforce those behaviours. However, most organisations unintentionally discourage new product development and risk taking because there are no clear compensation strategies for innovation. Also the widespread practice of viewing budgets as commitments to be delivered produces a number of performance limiting effects.
Constant communication set the stage for reviewing strategic plans, evaluating senior executives and setting expectations throughout the organisation about the importance of innovation thus need to plan a consistent, cohesive communication strategy over a significant period of time to change corporate culture to make it more accommodating to innovation through communication. By using number of different communication channels including, the corporate magazine, newsletter, voice mails and video clips, every employee’s role in innovation can be reinforced.
Training is an important component of cultural change, since it is unrealistic to expect people to take new responsibilities and innovate consistently without giving new tools and methods. Einstein defined insanity as doing the same things over and over again and expecting different results. Communication tells people what to do and training tells them new methods, processes and tools for innovation. Different results cannot expect from the same process without incorporating training on new thinking.
Trust and honesty are an essential part of successful business relationships. Also organisations care about its employees as much as it expects them to care about customers. Further individual employees should think for themselves and do what they believe is right to provide exceptional customer service. But most organisational members are not consciously aware of these deeply embedded values in a culture.
Rules and regulations of an organisation are considered an inalienable part of the culture. Friendly and supportive working environment ensures that the rules and regulations of an organisation are well defined and not a burden to its employees. It is important that employees feel motivated to follow the rules and regulations and are not being forced which leads to employee satisfaction and positive associations with the organisation, management and respective individual positions.
Corporate culture can work for an organisation to improve performance or against it by creating barriers that prevent the attainment of goals. It shapes the way people act, interact and strongly influences how things get done. Unhealthy cultural values played a crucial role in many of the mistakes that organisations made. Subcultures within the organisation sometimes contradict the large culture, adding to the complexity of diagnosis. The correct relationship among cultural values, organisational strategy and the external environment can enhance organisational performance.
People make change. Clear strategy and effective operations brings us to the optimal results. The ongoing transformation of an organisation is the results of the growth of the people who make up the organisation.
Therefore, organisations need to develop systematic ways to measure and manage the impact of culture on organisational performance.
