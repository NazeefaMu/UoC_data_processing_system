Minister promises to resolve human-elephant conflict

Wildlife Minister Field Marshall Sarath Fonseka has promised to resolve the human-elephant conflict in the next one-and-a-half years.
He explained that it was difficult to provide solutions to a long-standing problem, but he would work on implementing a strong foundation to establish a new mechanism to solve the human-elephant conflict.
The Minister made these observations to the media after a meeting held to discuss the issues surrounding the human-elephant conflict in the Meda Mahanuwara area yesterday afternoon.
The Minister had come to Kandy to inspect a wild elephant that the Wildlife Department had managed to capture. The elephant which resided in the Victoria, Randenigala, Rantambe reserves, had been responsible for the deaths of a few individuals in the area. “If I had three years, I would solve the problem once and for all,” observed the minister.
Minister Fonseka further observed that as it was not easy to capture such violent elephants. He had directed all regional officers to do so and said that assistance from the Wildlife office in Colombo would be provided to all regional officers to accomplish the task.
He added that either he or his deputy minister would participate at such occasions. The Minister noted that it was not only humans, but elephants that are also killed as a result of the conflict, and while the Department captured one elephant in Meda Mahanuwara for the death of humans, two elephants have been killed in Batticaloa as a result of human action. In the wake of such deaths, questions with regard to the actual effectiveness of electric fences have arisen, he said.
The Minister said that he would also not allow the smuggling of baby elephants which had been taking place in the recent past.
