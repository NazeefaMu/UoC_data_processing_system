‘No link between cocaine and Lanka Sathosa’

Lanka Sathosa Chairman T.M.K.B. Thennakoon said that there is no connection between the haul of cocaine found in a container in the Lanka Sathosa warehouse at Ratmalana and Lanka Sathosa. He said Police was informed about this by the Lanka Sathosa workers who detected the cocaine haul while offloading container contents.
"We must commend employees of Lanka Sathosa, Rathmalana for detecting the contents and informing Mount Lavinia Police.
‘‘It prevented the narcotic from reaching other parts of the country, he said. Addressing the media in Colombo on Thursday, he said a private sugar supplier who was selected through a tender bid for sugar supplies will be blacklisted if Police find any connection between the company and the smuggling of the cocaine.
Sugar has been imported from Brazil. Custom officials have re-sealed the container after inspections at the Orugodawatta Container Terminal Yard. Lanka Sathosa received the container fully sealed,” Thennakoon said.
