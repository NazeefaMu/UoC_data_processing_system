‘Last regime left behind huge debt’

Present good governance government has undertaken yeoman service for the public during the last three years. Hence, the UNP would win the upcoming local government elections, Agriculture State Minister Wasantha Aluwihare said recently.
Addressing an election rally at Matale Hilton colony to support UNP candidates contesting the Matale Pradeshiya Sabha, he said that when the present government came into power, a large foreign debt had been left behind by the previous regime. So, the Yahapalana government had to face a heavy foreign debt. But the government has taken every possible step to settle the debt successfully without any burden being passed onto the public.
Not only that, international communities were against Sri Lanka during the Rajapaksa regime. The present government has made efforts to reverse that situation. As the result, all international communities are standing with us now. Meanwhile, they have extended their full support to the Sri Lanka government, he said.
Now development activities are continuing with the help of international aid and people would reap the benefits shortly, he added.
Candidates of local government polls for Matale Pradeshiya Sabha, Gamini Costa, Indika Dias Hewavitharana, G. Kadigawa, Sepalika Perera and M. Muththaiya participated at the rally.
