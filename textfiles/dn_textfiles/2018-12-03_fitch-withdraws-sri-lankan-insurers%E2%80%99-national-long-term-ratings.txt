Fitch Withdraws Sri Lankan Insurers’ National Long-Term Ratings

Fitch Ratings has affirmed and simultaneously withdrawn the National Long-Term Ratings of all rated Sri Lankan insurers as the ratings are no longer considered by Fitch to be relevant to the agency’s coverage because the entities have not issued any debt.
The issuers’ existing National Insurer Financial Strength (IFS) Ratings are unaffected.
Prior to the withdrawal, the National Long-Term Ratings were affirmed with Stable Outlooks as there have been no significant changes in the credit profiles of the rated insurers in Sri Lanka since the previous rating actions on the insurers in 2018.
