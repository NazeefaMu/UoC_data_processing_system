E. Palaniswami is new Tamil Nadu Chief Minister

Edappadi K Palaniswami took oath as Tamil Nadu Chief Minister yesterday ending the 10-day political drama in Tamil Nadu which witnessed AIADMK General Secretary VK Sasikala and rebel O Panneerselvam involved in a bitter battle over the CM’s chair. Palaniswami, a Sasikala loyalist, is the third Tamil Nadu Chief Minister in less than three months. Governor C.Vidyasagar Rao has given Palaniswami 15 days to prove his majority in the Assembly.
On Wednesday evening, Palaniswami had met Rao and submitted a list of 124 MLAs supporting him in the 234-member Tamil Nadu Assembly, and requested the Governor to invite him to form the government. The Governor later also met the OPS faction.
The Tamil Nadu crisis started after J Jayalalithaa’s death on December 5 triggered a massive succession war within the ruling AIADMK.
Meanwhile, Sasikala Natarajan may have been thwarted by the judiciary, but the jailed general secretary of the ruling AIADMK in Tamil Nadu appears to be on a stronger wicket for now at least.
She has successfully managed to get her confidante, Edapaddi Palaniswami, into power, two days after the Supreme Court convicted her in a corruption case dating back to the 90’s.
With the decision of the state governor - who had been delaying choosing the next chief minister - to appoint Palaniswami as chief minister, Sasikala has the last laugh from her prison cell in Bangalore. Palaniswami is her trusted man, at least for the moment. He may be able to gather his own clout and emerge as an independent leader, but as of now that is only a distant possibility.
O.Panneerselvam, who was sworn in as caretaker chief minister after the death of Jayalalitha in December, was vacillating between rebellion and loyalty to Sasikala. He chose to rebel in theatrical fashion, conducting a 40-minute meditation at Jayalalitha’s memorial at Marina Beach in Chennai (Madras) before declaring that he was pressured to resign. But his rebellion came rather late in the day. He could never recover the ground he had lost. Sasikala’s elevation by the party had been questioned by acting chief minister O Panneerselvam, who said he had been “forced” to resign to make way for her. Her candidacy for the top job had been questioned, since she has never been elected to public office.
Sasikala’s role was always that of aide and confidante - she had never been given any formal role by Jayalalitha in the party or the state government.
But analysts say her proximity to power allowed her and her extended family to wield huge influence. - HINDUSTAN TIMES
