Japan confers prestigious decoration on Speaker

The Japanese government announced the conferment of The Grand Cordon of the Order of the Rising Sun on Speaker Karu Jayasuriya as recognition for his significant contribution in promoting bilateral relations between Japan and Sri Lanka.
A congratulatory message was sent by Japanese Foreign Minister Fumio Kishida upon the announcement stating: “Please accept my sincerest congratulations on the conferment of ‘The Grand Cordon of the Order of the Rising Sun” in recognition of your outstanding contribution, and my best wishes for your continued good health and happiness”.Before Jayasuriya went into politics in 1996 he served in the private sector for 32 years. While visiting Japan and doing business with Japanese companies as a leading businessman from Sri Lanka, he conceived an idea that Sri Lanka could develop by taking Japan as an example, and he wished for stronger ties between the two countries.
Since then, he has worked continuously for the promotion of bilateral relations, and when the Sri Lanka-Japan Parliamentary Friendship Association was established in 2001, he joined it as a Member of Parliament and later served as the President of Association from 2002 to 2004.
Jayasuriya, as the Speaker and a patron of the Sri Lanka-Japan Parliamentary Friendship Association, is keen to further promote exchanges between the Parliaments as well as Members of Parliaments of the two countries.
Since assuming office as Speaker he initiated Parliament to Parliament Diplomacy. This is the first time that this highest decoration is being given to a Sri Lankan.
