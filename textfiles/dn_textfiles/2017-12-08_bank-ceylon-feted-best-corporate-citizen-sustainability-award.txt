Bank of Ceylon feted at Best Corporate Citizen Sustainability Award

The Bank of Ceylon won two awards at the Best Corporate Citizen Sustainability (BCCS) Award Ceremony 2017 held recently at the Cinnamon Grand, Colombo. The Bank of Ceylon was recognized as the winner of the “Triple Bottom Line - Economic Sustainability (Profit) award” and also recognized as a “category winner – Economic Contribution award”.
The two awards were awarded to the Bank in recognition of its sustainable business growth, economic value creation and contribution towards national economy. Organized by the Ceylon Chamber of Commerce the event was graced by Kenichi Suganuma, Japanese Ambassador in Sri Lanka as the Chief Guest.
The Keynote speaker was David Bent, a Global Expert on Corporate Sustainability. The Award Ceremony recognizes Business entities that have shown exemplary performances as sustainable corporate entities. By recognizing these corporate entities the Ceylon Chamber of Commerce encourages companies to follow triple bottom line- People, Profit and Planet- sustainability practices and build a sustainable cycle where the company’s long term sustainability thrives as much as it gives back to the community and every possible stakeholder.
“Living up to its promise as “Banker’s to the Nation”, the Bank of Ceylon has strategically built its three pillars around its entire scope of operations to reap benefits for all its stakeholders.
As a State Bank, BOC’s objective is to assist the Government of Sri Lanka’s economic objectives that get translated into the whole country’s socio-economic development. Therefore, final beneficiaries of this whole process are all Sri Lankans in general. Currently BOC is the highest profit earning single business entity in the country. Its PBT of the year 2015 and 2016 were calculated as Rs. 25.3 Billion and Rs.31.2 Billion respectively” stated the General Manager D.M. Gunasekara.
“BOC” from being a responsible services provider for its customers, whose integrity has been tested over a span of 78 years, the Bank has evolved to deliver a service which goes beyond mere banking to its community.
The strategic implementation of digital transformation that commenced in early 2014 gradually replaced many of traditional procedures, policies and technologies and has laid down a solid foundation for the Bank to embark on “Green Banking”. The Bank of Ceylon has been engaged in green initiatives such as paper recycling, E-waste management, installing eco-friendly equipment, installing energy efficient lighting systems in branches and the head office, maintaining green gardens at selected branches with rain water harvesting systems. The solar powered system in selected branches is also a recent addition to the Bank’s Green Banking process.
By increasing its CDM/ATM network to reach over 900 machines throughout the country, encouraging customers to enroll with “Online Banking”, introducing “no passbook” SmartGen account option, workflow automation and Document Management Systems the Bank of Ceylon has not only promoted green banking but also promoted sustainable and inclusive economic growth.
