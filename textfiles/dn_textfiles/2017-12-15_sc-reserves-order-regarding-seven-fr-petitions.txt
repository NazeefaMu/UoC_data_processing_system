SC reserves order regarding seven FR petitions

The Supreme Court yesterday reserved its order regarding Fundamental Rights petitions filed by former Minister G.L.Peiris and six others challenging the enactment procedure of the Provincial Council Election Bill.
The Supreme Court will make an order regarding these petitions in due course and parties were directed to file their written submissions within one month.
The Attorney General yesterday informed the Supreme Court that Provincial Council elections could be held after March next year following the completion of the delimitation process.
Seven petitioners filed Fundamental Rights petitions in the Supreme Court challenging the legality of amendments purported to be made to the Provincial Council Election Bill at the committee stage of Parliament on September 20.
