CIC sponsors ‘SLMA Health Run & Walk 2017’

As in the past, CIC Holdings partnered with the Sri Lanka Medical Association (SLMA) to sponsor ‘SLMA Health Run & Walk – 2017’ that had a participation of nearly 3000 health conscious individuals.
The annual event was organised by the SLMA and the Sri Lanka College of Pulmonologists in collaboration with four ministries including the Ministry of Health, Ministry of Environment, Ministry of Women and Child Affairs as well as the Ministry of Education.
The event was held at the BMICH, under the theme ‘Clean Air for Healthy Living’ aiming to stress on the importance of raising awareness on environmental consciousness and proper waste disposal.
Furthermore, the event also coincides with Anti-tobacco Day, World Asthma Day as well as the World Environment Day.
Medical Professionals and Students, School Interact club members, Rotoract club members, members of the Tri-forces, individuals from the corporate sector, ministry officials, employees from private hospitals, fitness and running groups like Colombo City Running participated in the two separation sessions for running and walking. The T-shirts for the event participants were provided by courtesy of Brandix Lanka Ltd. An award ceremony for 100 winners of a Children’s Art competition was held at the BMICH premises on the same day, where the winning children and their parents were invited to participate in the ceremony.
The winners received prizes and certificates attested by the Education Ministerial Secretary, Women and Child Affairs Ministerial Secretary and the President of the SLMA. An exhibition was also held to showcase the 100 winning entries.
The Health Run & Walk is an annual event organised by the SLMA, the country’s national professional medical body. Founded in 1887, the association assembles medical practitioners of all grades attached to all branches of medicine, and creates a sustainable forum to support professional and academic development of its members.
