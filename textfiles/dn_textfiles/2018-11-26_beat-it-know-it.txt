To beat it; know it !

Extracted from Optimum Nutrition for Beating Diabetes authored by Dr.Renuka Jayatissa and published by Sarasavi Publishers.
Diabetes Mellitus (Diabetes) is a global problem with devastating human, social and economic impacts. As estimated by the World Health Organisation, today more than 200 million people worldwide are living with diabetes and by 2030; this total is expected to increase to over 366 million people. Each year another 7 million people develop diabetes.
What is Diabetes ?
Diabetes is a condition characterized by elevated blood glucose levels resulting from defects in insulin secretion and/or uptake. It develops when insulin is absent, not secreted in adequate amounts or the insulin is not used properly by the target tissues. There may also be a combination of these factors.
Insulin ?
Insulin is a hormone that is needed to properly metabolise the macro-nutrients (carbohydrates, fats and proteins) in the normal way to effectively convert glucose into energy needed for day to day life. It is produced by the pancreas.
How does insufficiency of insulin and excess of sugar lead to diabetes ?
If “sugar” is unable to be transported into cells, the sugar remains in the blood stream and produces a state of high blood sugar (hyperglycaemia).
What are the consequences ?
This prolonged state causes damage to the body by affecting large blood vessels (macrovascular) and small blood vessels (microvascular). It can cause blindness, heart disease, kidney problems, nerve damage, erectile dysfunction and amputations of limbs.
What are the types of Diabetes ?
a. Type 1 diabetes (juvenile diabetes or insulin dependent diabetes or IDDM) it is an auto-immune disease that affects the pancreas in a way that it does not release insulin. Insulin is required for a type 1 diabetic to survive; injections are given to replace the insulin.
b. Type 2 diabetes (adult onset of diabetes or non insulin dependent diabetes or NIDDM) It is a disease that progressively results in the inability of the pancreas to function properly. Overtime, the production of insulin diminishes by the pancreas. There is no single cause of type 2 diabetes, but some factors put people to a greater risk, including:
* being 40 or over
* being overweight
* born with birth weight less than 2500 grams
* having a family member who has diabetes
* having had diabetes during pregnancy (gestational diabetes).
* having metabolic syndrome.
Having metabolic syndrome
Metabolic syndrome is having excess fat around the waist (central obesity) with 2 of the other factors listed below. Central obesity is diagnosed when the waist circumference is,
more than 90 cm (36 inches) for men and
more than 80 cm (32 inches) for women
Other factors are:
* High blood triglyceride levels (>150mg/dL or 1.7 mmol/L)
* Low blood HDL cholesterol (<40mg/dL or 0.9 mmol/L)
* High blood pressure (Systolic>130 or diastolic > 85mmHg)
* High fasting plasma glucose (>100mg/dL or 5.6mmol/L)
How do you measure your waist circumference ?
* Run a tape measure around your midsection at about the level of your navel.
* Breathe normally, don't hold your tummy in, and don't pull the tape so tight that it presses your skin down.
Type 2 diabetes may require medication to control blood sugar. This may include oral medication and or insulin. Once a type 2 diabetic starts an insulin program, the person does not become a type 1 diabetic; the description for this patient is “Type 2 diabetic, requiring insulin.”
a. Gestational diabetes only occurs during pregnancy. After the delivering of the baby, the blood sugar returns to normal. Women who have gestational diabetes are at a higher risk for developing type 2 diabetes. Meal planning, exercise, and possibly medication are used to control the blood sugar during pregnancy.
b. Pre-diabetic is not considered as diabetic but has blood sugars that are higher than normal. It is a state of increased risk of progressing to diabetes, although it was also noted that many would revert to normal. There are about 3 million people with pre-diabetes in Sri Lanka. Usually diet. Exercise and weight management can prevent the onset of type 2 diabetes.
There are two categories under this group; Impaired Glucose Tolerance (IGT) and Impaired Fasting Glucose (IFG).
IGT falls between ‘normal’ and diabetes range. IGT is not a disease stage but is a risk factor for future diabetes and/or adverse outcomes. IGT is associated with muscle insulin resistance and defective insulin secretion. This is the most important stage for early detection to prevent the onset of diabetes.
IFG, as with IGT, is not a disease stage but rather a risk factor for future diabetes and adverse outcomes. IFG is associated with impaired insulin secretion and impaired suppression of liver glucose output. Identification of this stage helps to prevent the occurrence of diabetes.
Can oneself-identify Diabetes ? Many people with type 2 diabetes may be symptomless. Some may present;
* lethargy,
* fatigue,
* weight loss,
* increased urine excretion especially in the night,
* excessive thirst and water ingestion,
* skin infections, such as boils, carbuncles and abscesses,
* white plaques in the tongue due to oral fungal
* infections,
* non healing wounds,
* numbness
* blurred vision.
If you have any of these symptoms, it is better to check your blood sugar levels.

Tips to beat Diabetics
There are approximately 1 million Sri Lankans with Diabetes.
Pre-diabetes is the most important stage for early detection to prevent the onset of diabetes.
Good diabetes care and management can prevent or delay the onset of these complications.
Of the total diabetes population 90-95% has type 2 diabetes and the remaining 5-10% has type 1 diabetes.
