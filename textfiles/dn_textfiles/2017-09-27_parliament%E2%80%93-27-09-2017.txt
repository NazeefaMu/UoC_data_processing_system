Party Leaders to meet BASL officials
Party Leaders will meet the officials of the Bar Association of Sri Lanka (BASL) to discuss the process followed in passing the Provincial Council Election (Amendment) Bill recently, based on a statement made by them, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said in Parliament yesterday.
The Prime Minister made this observation in response to a query by Joint Opposition Parliamentary Group Leader Dinesh Gunawardene on a statement by the BASL that there had been a flaw in the process of passing the Provincial Council Election (Amendment) Bill. He said they had sought a meeting with President Maithripala Sirisena and Prime Minister Wickremesinghe.
The Prime Minister responding to the query, assured that the BASL and the leaders of the political parties representing the Parliament would have a meeting with on the matter. He also said that he met the BASL officials on Sunday. "I asked them if there was an issue," the Premier said, adding that, "I promised them that party leaders would meet them shortly to discuss the matter."
The Prime Minister also said that the manner in which the passage of the bill was conducted was not decided only by the Government.
"It was decided by all the party leaders in Parliament. The procedures pertaining to enacting of Bills have to be decided by Parliament as per the Constitution," he added.
PM reminds of those who misused power
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe yesterday said that there had been persons who took the powers of the people into their hands.
He made this observation yesterday responding to Joint Opposition MP Wimal Weerawansa who said that the Provincial Councils Amendment Bill passed in Parliament recently was to allocate 25 percent seats for women members. He said the content was changed by introducing amendments.
"In the same manner, the government could bring a Bill titled Presidential Elections Act and bring about amendments changing the entire system," Weerawansa said. "It could bring an amendment such as only a person who has 40 years experience in Parliament could contest for the presidency." MP Weerawansa raised the point of order, while the Prime Minister was responding to MP Dinesh Gunawardena to the latter's query on the BASL's statement on the the Provincial Councils Amendment Bill which was passed in Parliament recently.
The Prime Minister said the matter was discussed last week. "The Bill was debated and passed with a two thirds majority," he said.
Country poised to industrial boost: Senasinghe
The country would be transformed into an industrial city and the government would set up a 400 acre industrial city in Kalutara by December, International Trade State Minister Sujeewa Senasinghe said.
He made this statement during the debate on the order under the Export Development Act, in Parliament yesterday. “We intend to set up an industrial export zone of around 400 acres in Kalutara by December. This is a great asset to us. The industrial zone will manufacture electrical goods predominantly,” he said.
He said they were looking into ways of using natural rubber in the tyre industry. Sri Lanka is in the second or third place with regard to industrial tyres. “Due to the GSP concession, we will be able to increase garment production. We intend to bring in new technology and create new jobs and transform the country into an industrial hub,” Minister Senasinghe said.
He said the government was in discussion with the UK. He said around Rs. 10 billion in investment is expected in the near future.
Most Policemen serve in war affected areas to get additional payments: Sagala
It was only compulsory for police officers to serve in the war affected areas for a minimum of three years, but most of them stayed back due to the additional payments they received and not because they were forced to, Law and Order Minister Sagala Ratnayake said in parliament yesterday.
He made this observation answering to a query by JVP Leader Anura Kumara Dissanayake under standing orders 23 (2).
“But after the completion of three years, these officers could have requested for a transfer, and they were not forced to stay,” he said.
In transfers and promotions of police officers, there should be a proper mechanism. The government admits that there are flaws in the process. The government is in the process of rectifying the flaws, said Minister Ratnayake adding that this is a matter to be discussed at length.
In the North and East, police officers are required to work for at least two years before requesting a transfer. In Colombo, it is three years.
However, we will reduce the period of Policemen serving in Colombo too to two years, he said.
Minister Ratnayake said applications were called from officers serving in one province for over 12 years. They are required to name preferred places of transfer even if they don’t want to as it is required as per the circular, he said.
Anura Kumara Dissanayake said most police personnel in the North and East had to do so due to the need at the time of the war.
In response, Minister Ratnayake said the government was aware of the problems faced by these officers. Measures will be taken to address their grievances, he said.
Dissanayake raised concern over the issues faced by police officers being transferred a few years prior to their retirement having served in the East for long periods.
They have settled in these areas too and just a few years prior to their retirement, when they are transferred to distant districts, their lives are disrupted, he said.
Sri Lanka to cooperate with other countries on extradition law
Sri Lanka would work with the countries that have agreements to implement the extradition law, Justice and Foreign Employment Minister Thalatha Athukorale said.
The minister made this statement in Parliament yesterday joining the debate on the order under the extradition law.
“There are some criminals who commit a crime in one country and hide in another country. This has become a habit of criminals," he said.
Meanwhile, MP Wimal Weerawansa questioned the protection given to Rohingya refugees in Sri Lanka.
He said there are refugee centres in the Mirihana area close to the Police station. The danger is that these refugees have come out of the camps and are living in rented houses. Their children have been enrolled in schools. They live as Sri Lankans, he said.
Weerawansa said the government should focus their attention in this regard.
Minister Athukorale said if such details are available, the Defence Ministry should be notified for relevant action. With regard to the Rohingya refugees if Myanmar requests certain individuals are wanted in connection with a crime and wants them extradited, then we will consider it, she said.
Extradition Law aims to create peaceful world: Ruwan Wijewardena
The Extradition Law aims to create a peaceful country and peaceful world, Defence State Minister Ruwan Wijewardena said during the debate on the order under extradition law in Parliament yesterday.
The extradition law can comprehensively enforce the law against those who have committed crimes in a particular country, and are evading the law in that country. "We could safeguard the rule of law more effectively through the extradition law," the State Minister said.
He said extradition treaties will help Sri Lanka and foreign countries exchange wanted criminals.
“Sri Lanka has signed extradition agreements with several countries. Legal action can be initiated against any criminal of this country who has committed a crime, and is in hiding in those countries. Similarly, if any citizen of those countries who has committed a crime, and is evading arrest and hiding in this country, can also be brought before the law," the State Minister said.
Crimes can be curtailed through the mechanism through diplomatic means, he said. However, the State Minister said this will not have an effect on those seeking political asylum. He said it was important to increase the number of countries we have extradition agreements.
Wijewardena said Sri Lanka signed extradition treaties with several countries, including Ukraine. He said Sri Lanka will sign extradition treaties with European and Asian countries.
The State Defence Minister expressed these views after submitting the extradition treaties in Parliament yesterday, signed with Russia, Ukraine, China and Vietnam.
Dr. Jayampathy explains preconditions for extradition law application
There are two preconditions for the implementation of the extradition law, MP Dr. Jayampathy Wickramaratne said joining the debate on the extradition law in Parliament yesterday.
“One is that the particular crime should be considered a criminal offence in both Sri Lanka and the country making the request. This is called dual criminality where a suspect can be extradited from one country to stand trial for breaking a second country's laws only if a similar law exists in the extraditing country. The second is that the requesting state should have judicial power over the matter on which they are seeking extradition. These two conditions are vital in implementing the extradition law,” Wickramaratne said.
He said if a person to be extradited is facing the risk of political vengeance or discrimination, then under such circumstances, the person will not be extradited.
“There are such safeguards in the extradition law. An example of such an extradition clause is section 7 of the Torture Act of 1994 which was passed during the People’s Alliance government when Prof. G.L. Peiris was the Justice Minister.”
The Enforced Disappearance Bill does not alter Sri Lanka’s extradition law; it reinforces what other laws such as the Torture Act. He said as exemplary members of the international community, we are bound to take such measures. Wickramaratne said if a person who is to be extradited can prove his innocence in a Sri Lankan Court, he cannot be extradited.

Leader of the House and Highways and Higher Education Minister Lakshman Kiriella assured that the printing mistakes in the Provincial Councils Amendment Bill passed in Parliament recently, could be rectified.
He said the Party Leaders will look into as to how the printing mistakes could be rectified.

"The amendment which was approved in Parliament was that parties which poll less than 20 percent are exempted from the regulation of nominating of women to any Provincial Council when they are allocated three seats," MP Dissanayake said. "But what is printed in the final draft is that the exemption is imposed on parties if they are allocated three seats," he said.
"We assure that the printing mistakes will be corrected," Minister Kiriella said. "The Party Leaders will look into how the printing mistake could be rectified."
Local Government and Provincial Councils Minister Faiszer Mustapha responding to MP Dissanayake, accepted that there had been a printing mistake. He said the mistake had been made during the printing of the final draft which contains all the amendments passed in the House. He assured that it would be corrected.
Govt will decide the fate of 20 A: Kiriella
The government would decide as to what it does with the 20th Amendment to the Constitution Bill on a future date, Leader of the House and Highways and Higher Education Minister Lakshman Kiriella said in Parliament yesterday.
He made this observation in response to a question raised by the Joint Opposition (JO) as to why the 20th Amendment to the Constitution Bill remained in the Order Book of Parliament.
Joint Opposition MP Dinesh Gunawardena said the government informed the House that it would withdraw the Bill. Minister Kiriella said let it remain in the Order Paper.
"We will decide what to do with it and act accordingly. You are not here to decide what the government should do,” Minister Kiriella said.
