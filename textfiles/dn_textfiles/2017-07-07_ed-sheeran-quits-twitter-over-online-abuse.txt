Ed Sheeran 'quits' Twitter over online abuse

 
Ed Sheeran has claimed he is quitting Twitter following online abuse from his followers.
The Castle On The Hill singer has told The Sun he is fed up of being targeted by social media trolls and will from now on use Twitter only to make announcements.
"I've actually come off Twitter completely. I can't read it," he said.
"I go on it and there's nothing but people saying mean things. Twitter's a platform for that."
Sheeran's decision comes after the Glastonbury headliner suffered online abuse from some followers, who accused him of faking his guitar playing on stage.
"Never thought I'd have to explain it, but everything I do in my live show is live, it's a loop station, not a backing track. Please google," he wrote.
