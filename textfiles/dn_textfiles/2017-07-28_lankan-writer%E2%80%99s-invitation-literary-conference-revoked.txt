Lankan writer’s invitation to literary conference revoked

Sri Lankan writer, poet and activist, Sharmila Seyyid’s invitation to the Tamil Literature Conference has been revoked in opposition to her talk on the prevalence of Female Genital Mutilation among the Sri Lankan Muslim community.
Seyyid speaking to Daily News said that the organizers had initially invited her to speak on the subject on 30 July and later cancelled it following opposition from the Muslim men in the organizing committee.
The Conference which was initially started as an endeavour by the Sri Lankan Tamil speaking Diaspora in 1989, is the biggest meetup for Tamil language writers and poets. For the last two years, the event which was usually held in a European country or Canada, has been held in Sri Lanka.
In 2015, they held in Batticaloa, last year it was in Jaffna. So this year they wanted to bring it to the Hill country Tamils and it was to be held in Nuwara Eliya, Seyyid said.
Despite the Muslim organizers’ reluctance to deal with the subject, Seyyid believes that FGM is very much prevalent in the country and that it is usually done when the girl child is around 40 days old. Her research conducted in Muslim communities in Mawanella, Akurana, Batticaloa, Ampara, Trincomalee and Puttalam show that the practice still continues to this day.
In Sri Lanka, FGM involves making a tiny incision on some part of the female’s genital area, explained Seyyid,
“They believe the practice is a ritual purification and a symbolic act to integrate the baby into the community”, she added and has no basis in Islam.
According to the World Health Organization, FGM can have serious health impacts on the girl child later on in life and is an extreme form of discrimination against women.
When carried out on a young child, it is a violation of a child’s right to health, security and physical integrity.
“It is more often than not, carried out in secret. At times, the father would not know that such a thing has been done to his daughter”, said Seyyid as she explained that given the lack of knowledge on the procedure and its secretive nature, many who objected to it, often did not know whom to complain to in order to stop it.
