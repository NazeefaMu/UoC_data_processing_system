NPC to end wastage of public money

Speaker of the Parliament Karu Jayasuriya said that the National Procurement commission (NPC) will ensure that the people’s money and the wealth of this country is not wasted, but spent correctly for the benefit of the people.
He said, “We have lots of hopes in this area because independent commissions were part of the pledge that was given in the last election to ensure good governance and transparency,”
He was speaking at the launch of the “Action Plan and website of the NPC, yesterday, at BMICH.
Speaking on the importance of procurement, he said that there have been issues in the past especially when it came to tenders where public money was wasted.
“We saw in the past how the tenders and specifications were manipulated. The National Procurement Commission has a tremendous role to play. They are going to be the watch dogs for the people’s money,” he said.
Speaker further said that in 2007, one of the eminent programmes called “clean hands” was formed by the Ministry of Public Service and they studied the expenditure of the government money. The final report revealed that nearly 40% of waste and corruption were involved in spending public money.
“There was neither a correct procedure nor a proper system in place. The audit reports were also not followed up,” he said. The Action plan was developed by the NPC with the assistance of Short-term Assistance to improve Public financial Management reform (STAIR) project under the USAID Sri Lanka Reform Agenda (SLRA).
“The main mandate of the commission is to prepare fair, equitable, transparent, competitive and cost effective guidelines and procedures for public sector procurement process”, said Chairman of the NPC Eng. Nihal Wickramasuriya.
He said that NPC will play an oversight role on public procurement, and is now formulating proper procedures and guidelines for the procurement of goods and service, works, consultancy services and information systems of government institutions.
He said, “These guidelines are being prepared in accordance with international best practices and with the assistance of International donor agencies to fulfill the needs of the country.”
