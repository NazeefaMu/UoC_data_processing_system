Sunflower cultivation a profitable option

An experiment done by the Mapalana Agriculture Faculty of the Ruhuna University has proved that 40 percent more oil can be extracted from the Sunflower seeds than from coconut.
The experiment was conducted by a team led by Senior Professor K.D.N. Weerasinghe.
By distributing sunflower seeds among farmers, Prof. Weerasenghe said that at a time when the price of coconuts have increased in an unprecedented manner, the country could easily seek substitutes like the sunflower to provide edible oil.
He said that each sunflower has 200 to 300 seeds and pointed out that many areas in the country are conducive for sunflower plantation.
