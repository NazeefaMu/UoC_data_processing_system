The Department of Railways recommenced the rail transport of Prima flour from the China Fort in Trincomalee to Galle and Seeduwa. The relevant project contract was signed at the Department of Railways yesterday. GMR B.A.P. Ariyaratne and Group Manager Prima Company Tan Beng Chuan signed the contract on behalf of the Department and the Prima Company.
Under the terms of this agreement, the Prima Company will provide 15 goods wagons to the railways for this transport exercise and it is hoped to transport 15,000 tons of flour per month, a press release by the Transport and Civil Aviation Services Ministry said.
The Transport of goods, including flour, was recommenced on the directions of Minister Nimal Siripala de Silva. Earlier, the department began the transport of coal from Trincomalee to Mahawa, which brings in a monthly income of Rs. 8 million. The practice of using 80 tippers for coal transport was also given up as a result, which also helped to ease traffic congestion on the Trincomalee, Habarana, Kurunegala and prevent the consequent environment pollution caused by transporting coal along roads, said Minister Nimal Siripala de Silva who observed the signing of the agreement. Minister de Silva said, he hoped to introduce rail transport of petroleum and petroleum products too, in consultation with Petroleum Industries Minister Arjuna Ranatunge.
