A matter of opinion - Merv Hughes

One of the things he most enjoyed about sport was that people who liked to call themselves experts were frequently proved wrong. Forming views and making judgements on sporting performance would be great fun, but it could be fraught with danger. No one could predict it with absolute certainty the outcome of any game or race. He now found himself in the unenviable position of being asked his opinion on all sorts of matters relating to cricket. His experience and knowledge was limited because he had only played Test cricket for a short time. He did not pretend to be an authority on the game but there were a number of questions that he was asked at Sportsman’s nights and dinners and he hoped to answer these questions as best as he could states Merv Hughes in his book “Merv My Life and Other Funny Stories---“
WHO WAS THE HARDEST HITTING BATSMAN HE EVER PLAYED WITH AND AGAINST?

He considered himself a bit of a specialist in that area as his bowling suffered more than most from some big hitting. Ian Botham and Vivian Richards were probably the two most powerful batsmen he ever played against recalled Hughes .
Hughes first met Ian Botham when, as a young boy he attended a coaching camp at Benalla in Victoria. Botham had just begun his cricket career and was spending the English winter in Melbourne playing district cricket for University. Hughes asked for some advice and Botham told him, in a friendly way, to give up cricket and concentrate on tennis or golf because that was where the real money was.
Hughes ignored his advice and didn’t see him again till the first Test in Brisbane in 1986. Hughes noted that he was not quite as amiable that time. When Botham’s turn to bat came, he started slowly to get his eye in, however Hughes’ first ball to him - a good one just short of length outside off stump was deliberately sliced over third man for six. He couldn’t let him get away with that, he thought. Not wanting to be taken lightly, he let him have another bouncer next ball. Botham hooked it for another massive six.
Twelve off two balls. Not good for the figures. Stay cool and whatever you did, and don’t bowl another short one, he muttered to himself. He bowled a bouncer. Botham pulled it through mid-wicket for four. The ball struck with such a force that it bounced most of the way to the middle.
Well done, Merv, nice thinking, he screamed silently to himself. For God’s sake pitch the next one up. So he did. Botham crashed it through the covers for four.
Botham had an enormous heave at the next ball and missed (thank heavens) and scrambled a two off the last. Twenty-two off the over. Well bowled Merv have a rest. Good game cricket.
After the days play he had a chat to Botham and mentioned the advice he gave to him years before. Hughes recalled that Botham’s only comment was, “Well, I was right, wasn’t I?” Hughes was dropped from the team for the next Test.
WHICH BATSMAN IS THE HARDEST TO GET OUT
Although he had not bowled a great deal against him (bowling to him in the nets was bad enough), Allan Border’s record speaks for itself and is a testament to the high price he puts on his wicket.
To have survived for so long in such a demanding sport and to have performed so consistently proved that he was one of the toughest batsmen ever to play cricket, added Hughes.
Javed Miandad was another who had a phenomenal Test average recalled Hughes, he was particularly hard to dismiss in Pakistan! Javed was not the most popular of cricketers, and a back injury restricted his performance, although he was a great competitor and a gifted batsman.
In the Test series in Australia in 1990, Hughes bowled to him on several occasions. It is usually the case that the bowler attempts to intimidate the batsman by having a few words in his ear, but with Javed, it was the other way around. He was always speaking to Hughes. On more than one occasion he let one of his deliveries go past, looked up at him with contempt and said, “Hughes, you are not good enough for this - you should be off driving buses”. There have been times when he would agree with him.
The other batsman was Sunil Gavaskar. In his first Test match he spent a great deal of time bowling to Gavaskar and never once looked like getting him out. He scored 160 not out, and that Test was almost Hughes’ last. He is not sorry that he has retired and he won’t have to entertain him with his bowling, concluded Hughes.
SRI LANKANS ON THE RAMPAGE
It’s heartening to note that with the advent of Chandika Hathurusingha things have turned a full circle in the recent past, let’s hope that it will not be “a flash in the pan”. We fervently hope that “Hathuru” can call the shots all the time, without a big brother looking over his shoulder.
During our latest series with Bangladesh every one came to the party, Kusal Mendis, Danushka Gunathilake,Thisara Perera and Upul Tharanga. In my book it was Dasun Shanaka who outdid the rest, his timing was sublime and his placements were inch perfect and if he could improve his bowling he could be a real asset in our T20 outfit. Unfortunately Dinesh Chandimal although he gave excellent leadership to the team was somewhat disappointing in his batting, he found it difficult to pick the gaps especially in the mid off and cover region. The selectors might find it difficult to slot in Angelo Mathews (fit or otherwise), since every Tom Dick and Harry are in form with the bat.
