Walk for children

A walk was conducted at Independent Square last evening aiming to free the school system from corporal punishment by 2020. President Maithripala Sirisena joined the walk, which was organised by a civil organization called “Lama Hinsanayata Thitha,” as the Chief Guest. Considering the negative impact of corporal punishment, 131 countries including Sri Lanka have taken measures against child harassment. A petition containing five policy statements and 3,000 signatures to do away the corporal punishment in schools was handed over to the President by Otara Gunawardene. Picture by Chandana Perera
