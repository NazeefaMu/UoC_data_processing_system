Pooja at Ruwanweli Seya for war heroes

The Siyapath Wandana pooja to invoke blessings on war heroes who are deceased, disabled, or missing in action will be held on Saturday, November 3, at Ruwanweli Maha Seya in Anuradhapura, under the patronage of former Defence Secretary Gotabhaya Rajapaksa.
At the pooja, 29,000 lotus flowers will be offered to the Ruwanweli Seya in memory of the 29,000 deceased and 15,000 disabled soldiers as well as those missing in action due to the war against terrorism that prevailed in the country for nearly three decades.
This pooja is organised by civil society organisations such as Pahan Maga, World Patriotic Sri Lankan Forum, and the Hela Ranaviru Balamuluwa.
Major Kamal Gunaratne and several other former Tri Forces officers will participate in this pooja.
