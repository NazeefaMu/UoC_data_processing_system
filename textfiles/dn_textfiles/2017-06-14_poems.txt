Poems

RAIN, UNRULY RAIN
Rain, unruly rain, are you a friend or a foe?For days and months, you were hiding somewhereHow much we suffered we cannot explain.No water to drink, no water to cookNo water to wash – what a mess it was.Animals were roaming searching for waterPlants were withering, drooping they were.We all were praying watching the skiesYet you were deaf to all our prayers.You’ve come back. Oh! What a blessing.But ...What’s going to happen,I began to wonder!From morn till night, you poured and pouredWithout a pause, without a break.Overflowing were the drains, flooded were the gardens.Please don’t become so disastrous, I prayed.Are you punishing all of us,For the irreparable disasters, a few had committed?We know that our healthy forests,Were stripped off of their age-old trees,Flattened and levelled were the beautiful hills,To make way for skyscrapers.Brutally damaged were the river banksWith incessant, illegal sand mining.Mother Earth had bitterly criedSeeing her own children ruining her.Only a few are culprits, we knowYet, ‘One bug bites: but all are killed’Do we all have to sufferBecause of a few an unruly ones?

Juliet without a Romeo
You are bound to allNot to peculiar type manWho makes bogus loveYou are a JulietBut he is not a RomeoYour life was not well read by himBut by others wellYour departure makes ourInside full of sorrowYour blind faith in himHas fallen you in darknessYou plant your loveInside the poisonous vesselYou suck the poisonWith little and poor knowledgeWordless expressionHas been drawn on your faceIs the trustee on youYou departed as the shading SunSinking us in a darknessVacuum created inside usCan’t be fulfilledYou have left this worldAs an icon of Asian girl

Lonely
Not a soul to be seen,Can't understand what it means,Have to say it leads to fear,Fear that the end's very near.No human stepped in,Only cats searching the bin,The wind was so fearfully mild,Playing its tunes in the wild.Then again the nasty silence,None came to break the silence,I would've committed suicide in pain,If only I got out of being in vain.No face turned up to smile,I stopped breathing for a while,The falling leaves touched me kindly,To make me realise – that I was, after all; lonely.

UNIVERSAL EMBARRASSMENT
That’s where cultures differ,Stepping into the second stage.Male kept apart, even though dad or siblingMother’s warmth, foremost of all.Uncomfortable, stains in dress, frightenedNo peers can help, a mother is a guardian, the mentor.Confined to a room, no oily food, other restrictions,Alarming stories, into the ears, to a brave new world she goes.An array of rituals, poverty not a barrier,Bathing is the coronation, pride of the family.‘’Fallen from the tree’’ teasing goes on, yetLoads of blessings, myriads of presents.Grace and honour, duties of a womanGravity of living, handling of life,Thrust on her, by all and sundryElders are the mentors.Private happening within the bodyCulture-wise happens that all,Public display or hidden thingCulture says it all.

Time for unmasking
Come let's sit and talkYou as you areMe as I amIt's time for unmaskingA little bit of you is meA little bit of me is youWe are not miles apartWe are but smiles apartOh.. how cruel this silence is!Dumb it is when we converseLoud it is when we don'tRustling of the stillnessKeeps our nights awakeOh dear...We know too wellA whisper... a micro touchAll that is neededTo shatter your angerSo let's bring down the curtainAnd sit and talkYou as you areMe as I am.Yes… It's time for unmasking
