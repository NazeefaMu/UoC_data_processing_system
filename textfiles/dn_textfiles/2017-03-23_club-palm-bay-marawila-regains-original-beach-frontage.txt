Club Palm Bay Marawila regains original beach frontage

 Club Palm Bay Marawila has once again been blessed with their original beach frontage thanks to the efforts of the Department of Coast Conservation.
After several appeals made to the government by the hoteliers in the area the coast conservation authority launched a mammoth project to recall the beach and today it’s in its original position for which the hotel sector is thankful.
“However with the monsoon season coming next month there is a threat that the beach would be once again washed away since there is no breakwater. If the breakwater is not built immediately the beach would be washed again and millions of rupees would go down the drain, said General Manager, Gamini Keerthisinghe.
He said that with the re introduction of the beach the hotel has once again re launched their beach activities.
“We now offer beach weddings for foreigners and also dining under the stars and moon in the beach. We offer daily buffet and due to this the hotel is now becoming a much sought after destination for local for corporate outing and also a place as a transit point when travelling to Wilpattu. The hotel is also planning to build second swimming pool mainly to cater to daily outing and the large local groups that patronize the hotel.”
The hotel also introduced the new look state-of-the-art banquet hall following an investment of Rs. 60 million. The new Mini Conference Hall which accommodates 60 has also been renovated with all facilities to cater to smaller functions. “This is our main MICe facilty.”
Club Palm Bay Marawila is a 4-star resort hotel and maintains over 60% year and year occupancy. The hotel also has two suites with a large pool and an Ayurvedic centre.
Chief Engineer, Lalith Kumararasinghe, said that the hotel had been winning several local and international awards including the, best Energy Efficient hotel, Environmentally friendly hotel and the Engineer best enterprise of North Western Province.
Aruna Shantha Fernando, Executive Chef said that there is a growing demand by Foreigners for local food. “Ambul Thiyal is one such specialty.”
