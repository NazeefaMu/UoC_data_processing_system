Special mental health hotline 1926 opens

Sri Lanka Telecom (SLT) Chairman Kumarasinghe Sirisena and Health Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne opened a special hotline for those struggling with mental illness, a Health Ministry spokesman said. The public can dial the hotline number 1926 to seek help.
The number coincides with the year the National Institute of Mental Health at Angoda was constructed.
Medical experts said that the introduction of the hotline was necessary as the suicide rate in Sri Lanka was around 14 to 15 percent per 100,000 people.
It was once 47 percent per 100,000; Sri Lanka recorded the world's second highest suicide rate at the time. Three thousand two hundred and sixty-three Sri Lankans had committed suicide last year and of them, 2,586 were males while 677 of them were females.
