Court order sought to prevent arrest

Two persons submitted a writ application to the Galle Magistrate Court seeking an order preventing their arrest by the police for allegedly providing refuge to the suspect in the shooting of the vehicle driven by SAITM Chief Executive Officer.
They said in their writ application that police moves were going on to arrest them on allegations of providing refuge to the suspect.
Indralal Gamini Bandaragoda of Hiribura, Galle, a former co-ordinating officer attached to a former minister, and Angampodi Jagath Ananda, a former UC member of Talagasdeniya, Hikkaduwa submitted the writ application.
The two persons are alleged to have brought the suspect in the shooting to Hikkaduwa and provided him with lodging at a guest house.
They have stated that they have not committed any crime and the Mirihana Police Special Crimes Division and the Mihindu Mawathe Police Organised Crimes Division were planning to arrest them on charges of aiding and abetting the suspect in the shooting and if they are arrested, they would be severely beaten up and implicated in a court case.
The Galle Magistrate considered the writ petition and fixed the case for further hearing on April 4.
