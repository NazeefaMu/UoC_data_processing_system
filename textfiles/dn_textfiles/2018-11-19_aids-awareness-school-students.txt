AIDS awareness for school students

All senior school students countrywide should be educated on sexually transmitted diseases that are fast spreading in the country. About 2,300 education programmes on AIDS and its preventive measures have been planned for schools in the Kurunegala and Puttalam Districts during November and December, said W.M. Balasooriya, Kurunegala District senior Director of Education speaking at a meeting of school heads of the district at Wariyapola Teachers’ Resources Centre.
In 2017, 285 positive AIDS patients were detected across the country. About six new AIDS patients are detected every week by health authorities.
The Health Ministry has estimated that there are around 4,200 positive AIDS infected patients in the island by now. These patients are between the ages of 15 and 42. The aim of the government is to wipe out HIV and AIDS by 2025. All school heads and parents of the North Western Province should assist the Health Ministry and the Education Ministry to implement these education programmes successfully. About 760 PHI s and 140 resource personnel would be deployed for carrying out these education programmes, he said.
