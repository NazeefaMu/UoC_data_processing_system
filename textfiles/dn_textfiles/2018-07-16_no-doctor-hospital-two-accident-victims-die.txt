No doctor at hospital: Two accident victims die

Medical officers were not available at the Thammennawa hospital on July 14 to attend to those who sustained fatal injuries in a motorcycle accident at Ambagahawela in Seeppukulama, residents complained.
A student who assisted to carry the injured to the Thammennawa hospital said the life of the eight-year-old boy who died in the accident could have been saved if a doctor was on duty that day.
Three in the same family were seriously injured when the motorcycle they were riding veered off the road and collided into concrete utility pole.
The father, Sumanapala Thilakaratnage Prasad Lanka Thilakaratne (41), and son Malitha Thilakaratne (8) succumbed to their injuries while the mother, Deepika Udayangani Kumari (37) is receiving treatment at the Anuradhapura Teaching Hospital ICU. The Police suspect that the inability to control speed or the rider falling asleep could be the cause for this accident. Residents complained that even though the injured were rushed to the Thammennawa government hospital, a doctor was not available to attend to them.
“We immediately carried the small child to the hospital and he showed signs of life. As a doctor was not available we had to carry him to Mihintale government hospital, but the child passed away before we reached that hospital,” a student who assisted to carry the injured to the hospital said. Mihintale Police is conducting further investigations.
