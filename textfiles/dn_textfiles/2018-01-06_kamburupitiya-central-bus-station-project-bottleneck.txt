Kamburupitiya central bus station project in bottleneck

Work on the proposed Kamburupitiya new central bus station is proceeding at a snail’s pace, sources say.
A senior official attached to the Kamburupitiya Pradeshiya Sabha said its construction work was ceremonially inaugurated in early 2014 by the previous administration.
It comprises two storey building and will have a shopping complex, offices for SLTB officials and private bus operators, and separate rest rooms for clergies once it was completed.
Work on the bus stand yard and the public lavatory are still under construction, the sources said.
The building now has become a dwelling of vagrants, anti-social elements, stray dogs and cattle heads, while the public have to suffer scorching sunlight until buses come.
The bus station costs Rs.115 million to the Pura Neguma National Development Project, Provincial Councils and Local Government Ministry and the Kamburupitiya Pradeshiya Sabha.
Residents of the area request the authorities to speed up the project and vest it in the public as soon as possible.
