Defective vehicles transporting schoolchildren in Hambantota caught

Ten vehicles transporting schoolchildren were given orders not to engage in the business and their owners and drivers were admonished to repair their vehicles in 14 days and forward them for further inspection by the Inspector of Motor Vehicles in Hambantota.
School vans and buses in the Hungama police area were inspected last week and issued warnings to many of them for operating with numerous defects.
