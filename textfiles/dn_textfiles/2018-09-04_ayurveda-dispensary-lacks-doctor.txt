Ayurveda dispensary lacks doctor

The Gokarella Ayurveda Dispensary, which is under the Ibbagamuwa Pradeshiya Sabha’s jurisdiction, has lacked a doctor for a long time. Fifty patients per day, are affected as a result.
The dispensary’s Ayurveda doctor had taken maternity leave on June 23.
When questioned, Ibbagamuwa Pradeshiya Sabah Chairman U.K. Sumith Udukumbura said that they had requested an Ayurveda doctor from the North Western Ayurveda Department to stand in as a temporary replacement.
“However, no doctor has been appointed so far, and I plan on making a request again,” Udukumbura said.
