Gajaba Regiment celebrates anniversary

The Gajaba Regiment, one of the most prestigious regiments in the Sri Lanka Army, celebrated its 35th anniversary recently at the Regimental Centre, in Saliyapura, Anuradhapura, with a series of events, adding to its proud history.
The Gajaba Regiment was inaugurated on October 14, 1983, in Anuradhapura. The regiment was founded and nurtured by late Major General Vijaya Wimalaratne and played a crucial role in the 30-year war against the LTTE, which resulted in 76 of its officers and 4,463 other ranks wounded in action and 171 officers and 4,079 who sacrificed their lives for the motherland.
The ceremony was the finale of a series of anniversary ceremonies that got underway last week. The day’s chief guest, Major General Shavendra Silva, the Colonel of the Gajaba Regiment and the Adjutant General of the Army Headquarters was warmly welcomed by the Centre Commandant, Colonel Harendra Peiris.
A guard turnout in accordance with military formalities greeted the chief guest at the entrance to the Gajaba Regimental Centre. The Colonel of the Regiment also paid tribute to the Founding Father of the Gajaba Regiment, late Major General Wimalaratne by placing a floral wreath at his statute. He was then invited to accept the salute by the Parade Commander Lieutenant Colonel Sandun Dias in conformity with military traditions presented in his honour. Major General Silva paid his gratitude, during his brief address, to those who had served bravely, including the former Colonels of the Regiment, all officers and men, in order to maintain the regiments’ pride.
Then the Colonel of the Regiment placed a floral wreath at the Gajaba Monument in memory of all the officers and other ranks who paid the supreme sacrifice during the line of duty.
Regimental council members, the Centre Commandant, Deputy Centre Commandant, Commanding Officers, regimental staff, other ranks and several parents, widowers and children of the fallen Gajaba war heroes attended the event.
