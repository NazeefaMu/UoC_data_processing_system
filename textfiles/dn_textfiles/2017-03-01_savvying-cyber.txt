Savvying in cyber

Understanding their own identity has helped them establish themselves in the music scene. Giving life to old hits as a means of popularizing and preserving them for the future, the cyber based band Api Machan has creates vibes among music lovers.
Though they are only about four months old, Api Machan has over 9000 hits in their online video channel. Their voice ranges superbly infuse life to the good old hits, giving them a nw vibe which appeals to the modern music lovers.
Shooting for a music video
Madhawa Hewawasam, a recording engineer, composer, music producer and lyricist by profession, is the manager of the group. He has penned his first song ‘Alen Vela Ganna’ sung by Athula Adhikari and Samitha Mudunkotuwa in 2011. Motivated by the feedback he received for his work he ventured further in the field and penned many more lyrics.
“Once a song becomes popular many more songs which are similar to the original are released to the market. They are almost carbon copies of the original because they encompass similar lyrics and tunes. These lack quality. I was disappointed by this aspect and set my lyric writing aside for a while. It was during this stage that I felt that reviving old hits has become a necessity today,” he said.
He notes that Api Machan does not cater to the popular ‘ringing tone’ market but moves towards the classical styles of the golden past.
“We are composing a few songs of our own now. We have already released two songs ‘Hansa Bottuwe’ with Sumith Mandanayaka and ‘Me Nagaraya Aluth Wela’ which was released for Valentine’s Day this year. ‘Hansa Bottuwe’ has received over 41, 000 views up-to-date,” Madhawa said.
Speaking about how the band’s name originated Madhawa said that they noticed that they addressed each other as such whenever they proposed to engage in some activity.
“Hence we decided to name ourselves in the same manner. The name too generated interest because it is funky. It is no use naming ourselves with a name which is foreign or difficult to pronounce as we want to get close to the music enthusiasts,” he said.
There is a lot of music that is being created these days which is aimed solely at making money. They lack depth as well as quality.
“People listen to these songs because they have no other choice. We aim to create a fan base with the taste for quality music and songs. Once they learn to recognize and appreciate the real thing, then they would be up for originals of superior quality,” he added.
Api Machan consists of five members. They originally started off with four members but decided to add one more individual as an extra member just in case one cannot make it on a particular day. The ‘extra’ became a permanent member in the group and all five sing as well as play music instruments. They use minimal instruments in their music so that their vocals dominate the tracks.
Norman Fernando, Dhanushka Edirisinghe, Nisal Sutheekshana, Harsha Withanage and Manuja Mahawatte make up Api Machan. Thiwanka Mihiran is the video director of the team. Subash Lakmal and Chathuka Madhuranga also support Api Machan’s efforts.
The voices of the band members too vary from each other. Dhanushka has a Western voice and accent. Nisal was in the first 16 in the Derana Dream Star Season 6. Harsha has a base voice. He won fourth place in Sirasa Super Star Season 6. He and Dhanushka have both been trained under Kasun Kalhara. Harsha has also been a disciple of Maestro Premasiri Khemadasa. Norman originates from Kandy and has the talent to imitate the voice of original artistes. Manuja has a voice which can handle a variety of styles. He became the second runners up on Derana Dream Star Season 3.
A bulk of Api Machan’s audience are between 25 to 35 years. Only 48 per cent are home Sri Lankans while 52 per cent are Sri Lankans living abroad. Over nine percent of their fans are from Australia.
“We have had comments from fans abroad stating that their children have never listened to Sinhala songs. However once they have listened to one of the old hits we have sung and released on Youtube, they have become fans of these old hits and are now listening to them continuously,” Madhawa revealed adding that he considers this quite a triumph indeed.
Making money is not the objective of their venture. They do not make money out of the videos that have uploaded in Youtube. Nor do they perform at weddings or gigs.
“Due to this reason nobody can accuse us of making money out of these songs. We have credited the songs to the artistes and lyricists who own them. The original work is also inserted into the web along with our version. Since our efforts popularize these old songs, the owners can actually make money via Youtube by establishing their rights,” Madhawa added.
Queried if they have plans to include a female member to their group the team adds that though they might invite female vocalists to sing with them for some songs, they do not have any plans to rope in one as a permanent member.
“Often, we have to venture far and go through various hardships to make the perfect videos. A girl cannot undergo or overcome most of these hurdles,” Madhawa explained.
The team ventures far and wide when they are on the hunt for video locations. Thiwanka leaves no stones unturned when he is engaged in his work and this is evident by the quality of the video. A three time President’s Award winning short film cinematographer, Thiwanka obtained his Higher National Diploma in Design at Sri Lanka National Design Institute in Katubedda, Moratuwa. He also has a sound engineering training and a design diploma to his name.
“We hope to collaborate with other artistes according to the song’s requirements. We are currently in the process of doing another number with Madumadawa Aravinda,” Madhawa expressed adding that they hope to make their own music style and set their mark in the local music industry.
Talking about their future plans Madhawa added that thought they are planning to venture into originals, their motto would always be to maintains their standards without following the trends of the music scene. Semi live performances is a path they hope to take but they would continue to function as a Youtube band and keep the music enthusiasts’ superior taste for Sinhala music alive across the globe.
