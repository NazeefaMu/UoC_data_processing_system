Ekala Surakeeme Sanvidhanaya to meet religious leaders over garbage issue

The Members of the Ekala Surakeeme Sanvidhanaya (Association formed to Protect Interests of Ekala Polity) will meet His Eminence Malcolm Cardinal Ranjith, the Archbishop of Colombo and Most Venerable Kotugoda Dhammavasa Thera, the Prelate of the Amarapura Sect, of the Amarapura Chapter to ascertain the future of the Ekala residents who have registered their protest over the attempts of the Colombo Municipal Council to dump the Meethotamulla garbage at Ekala, Jaela.
While appreciating the support of the media let the authorities open their eyes to stark realities Ven. Dhammaseeha, the incumbent monk of Dharmodaya Buddhist Centre, Ekala told the media.
Members of the Association with the Members of the Eksath Welenda Sangamaya, Ja-ela would also be meeting the Secretary of the Ja-ela Divisional Secretariat in the coming week. “We have come to know that President Maithripala Sirisena has assured via telephone both the Cardinal and the Prelate of Amarapura Chapter that steps would not be taken to move the Meethotamulla garbage to Othe-Onaagama, Ekala. We will learn more about this when we meet both His Eminence and the Most Ven. Prelate in the coming week,” they said.
The Chief of the Ekala Dharmodaya Centre told the media that through numerous meetings and communications via letters the Association had informed the authorities concerned the unsuitability of the land ear-marked by the Colombo Municipal Council to dump the Meethotamulla garbage. The Ja-ela Development Committee and even the Secretary of the Ja-ela Divisional Secretariat have pointed out in clear terms the unsuitability of the land chosen to dump garbage and in spite of their protest if steps were taken to dump the garbage, that would cause multiple health problems and cause a big calamity, not having good water resources for drinking and cooking.
“In our letters and discussion we have told the authorities concerned that if the area ear-marked comes under heavy rain just for one hour, the whole area would get flooded and would go under water disturbing and preventing vehicular and people’s movements. During the last flooding, over 11,000 residents of the area had to be assisted and provided with dry rations as the area went under water. Things would be worse if garbage is dumped,” the Ven. Thera added.
