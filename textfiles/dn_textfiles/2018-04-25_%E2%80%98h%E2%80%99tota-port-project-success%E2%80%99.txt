‘H’tota Port project a success’

Both China and Sri Lanka have benefited from World Trade Organisation (WTO) and the global trade rules, which have contributed to China’s reform and opening up and also making Sri Lanka a jewel in the Indian Ocean, said the Ambassador of China to Sri Lanka, Cheng Xuetuan.
“Upholding economic globalization will bring a brighter future to the world. Sri Lanka, with its unique geographical location, has always been actively participating in economic globalization. As long as it adheres to trade liberalization and economic globalization, Sri Lanka’s great dream of becoming an important economic center in Asia would surely be realized in coming years. Under the guidance of the important consensus reached by the leaders of our two countries, the framework of the Belt and Road Initiative, and the tide of economic globalization, Sino-Sri Lanka pragmatic cooperation have developed rapidly,” he said.
The Ambassador said that the comprehensive development project of the Hambantota Port has proceeded smoothly and Sri Lanka has added a new important portal to the outside world. The construction of the Port City Colombo is steadily progressing day by day, on which many overseas investors have shown strong interest.
“The Economic Corridors of Colombo-Hambantota, Colombo-Kandy (Spelled out by Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinge) are also set to flourish. With all these collaborative efforts, economic development of the island nation is expected to embark on the fast track.”
China is willing to work together with all countries, including Sri Lanka, to safeguard the multilateral trading system, promote further development of economic globalization, build a new form of international relations and a community of shared destiny, so as to bring greater welfare and brighter future to the people of the world. Commenting on the global business arena he said that since March 2018, the US Trump administration has unilaterally adopted a number of trade protection measures, which might trigger a global trade war that would affect the whole world.
“These dangerous measures of unilateralism and protectionism are very likely to seriously damage the global economy that is undergoing a difficult recovery, impacting on everyone, in one way or the other.”
Facing the US Trump administration’s attempt to unilaterally wage a trade war against China, Beijing has taken firm countermeasures in the first place.
China’s position on this issue is very clear: It neither wants a trade war nor willing to fight a trade war. But if a country insists to provoke one, China will follow suit to the very end, taking all necessary measures to defend its rights and interests, and safeguard the rules-based international trading system.
