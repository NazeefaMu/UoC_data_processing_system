CA Steering Committee meets Provincial Council Chief Ministers

The Steering Committee of the Constitutional Assembly met Provincial Council Chief Ministers at the Parliamentary complex yesterday.
The Steering Committee chaired by Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe had sought the views, proposals and suggestions of the Chief Ministers on the Constitutional Reforms.
The power devolution and the Chief Ministers’ experiences on the 13th Amendment had been discussed. The chief ministers were of the view that whatever powers given to the provincial councils must be given clearly, without making them concurrent powers which are shared by both the central government and the provincial council.
Northern Provincial Council Chief Minister C V Vigneswaran did not turn up, but had sent a representative to the meeting. He had spoken in the lines of federal solution.
The Southern and North Central Province Chief Ministers were absent.
