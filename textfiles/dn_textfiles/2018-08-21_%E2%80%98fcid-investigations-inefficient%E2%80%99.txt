‘FCID investigations inefficient’

The Financial Crimes Investigation Division (FCID) had been inefficient in their investigations, Health Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne said.
He was addressing a ceremony held at Biyagama, recently. “The FCID was formed to investigate large-scale frauds,” he said, adding that even corruptions of Rs.500 and Rs.1,000 were investigated. Middlemen were arrested, while kingpins were let off the hook, Dr. Senaratne added.
