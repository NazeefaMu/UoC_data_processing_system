Over 20,000 graduates for government service

Cabinet approval has been given to recruit 20,000 graduates to government service this year.
Public Administration and Management, Law and Order Minister Ranjith Maddumabandara said the recruitment process will be done in four stages.
The first two stages will take place in 2018, while the other two stages will be in 2019, he explained. “As the first stage, 5000 graduates will be recruited. 15,000 will be then recruited in the second stage. Accordingly in 2018, we will be recruiting 20,000.
The Cabinet is yet to decide on the number of graduates that would be recruited in 2019,” Minister Maddumabandara said yesterday. He also said that 3% of the recruited will be differently-abled graduates.
Maddumabandara said the Cabinet decision pertaining to the matter was taken up in July 19, 2018. Minister Maddumabandara in answer to a question by Joint Opposition MP Kanaka Herath said the government had received 66,823 applications and 49,919 of these graduates had been interviewed.
The Minister said there are no political favourations influencing the recruitment process.
