‘Piece of Italy’ to Sri Lanka

PastaMania, Singapore’s largest Italian casual dining chain, was opened in Colombo recently. The brand is well-known for its over the top pasta creations and exquisite thin-crust pizza selections.
PastaMania offers an extensive menu of more than 130 choices and with many items labeled with calories count. With the most
extensive pasta menu in town, consumers get to customise their meal by choosing the type of pasta they want from a selection of spaghetti, linguine, penne, fusilli or whole meal. PastaMania also rolled out a ‘Doughworkz’ programme whereby young children were taught how to make their own ‘pasta and pizza’ and work within a community.
