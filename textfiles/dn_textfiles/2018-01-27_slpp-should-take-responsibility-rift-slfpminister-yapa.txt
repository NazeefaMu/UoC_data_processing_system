SLPP should take responsibility for rift in SLFP:Minister Yapa

The Sri Lanka Podu Jana Peramuna (SLPP) should take responsibility for the rift in the Sri Lanaka Freedom Party, despite the friendly hand extended by its leadership on various occasions, said Disaster Management Minister Anura Priyadarshana Yapa yesterday.
He said the SLFP was so enormous that it was two fold larger than the UNP. "But it was defeated since it did not understand the pulse of the common people," Minister Yapa said. "Even grave yards in the Gampaha district have been carpeted, but Gampaha was defeated for the first time in in its history. Educated people shunned a few members of a family who were enjoying the dividends of politics."
He made these observations, during a rally held at Gampaha yesterday.
He further said that President Maithripala Sirisena permitted us to contest together at the previous General Election in order to set up our own government. "But some politicians outside did not permit us to do so," Minister Yapa said.
He added that the SLFP was a living party and it would grow continuously though the Sri Lanka Podu Jana Peramuna was attempting to split it.
Sports Minister Dayasiri Jayasekara said that the previous government was defeated as it did not punish wrong doers. He said that President Maithripala Sirisena always stood against corruption. He stated that the President had attempted to look into the Treasury bond issue since 2008. "So that the members of the SLPP and the UNP were attacking the President today," Minister Jayasekara said.
Former MP Piyasiri Wijenayake also spoke on the occasion.
