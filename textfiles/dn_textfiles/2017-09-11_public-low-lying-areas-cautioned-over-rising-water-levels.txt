Public in low-lying areas cautioned over rising water levels

One spill gate of the Laxapana reservoir and two of the Canyon reservoir were opened yesterday due to rise of water level following heavy rains in the area.
The Disaster Management Center issuing a warning to public residing in low-lying areas cautioned them over the rising water levels. The Meteorology Department issuing weather forecast for today (11) states showery condition over the island is expected to enhance during September 11 to 14.
The department states that showers or thundershowers will occur in the Western, Southern, Sabaragamuwa, Central and North-Western Provinces, particularly after 2.00 p.m.
The marine forecast states that spells of showers may occur in the sea areas off the coast from Mannar to Hambantota via Colombo and Galle, while the sea area off the coast extending from Galle to Pottuvil via Hambantota could be fairly rough at times.
