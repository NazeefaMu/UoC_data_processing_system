Cabinet awards grid station contract to ABB India

In a bid to increase power generation prospects, the Cabinet has given its approval to award the contract for construction and development of the Biyagama 220/33 Kv Grid Substation to ABB India Limited.
The contract is valued at Rs. 1,434 million. The contract was approved upon the recommendation of the Cabinet-appointed standing procurement committee.
Meanwhile, it was also noted that the production capacity of the Heavy Welding and Machine workshop of the Department of Government Factory was inadequate and more space was needed to meet an ever-increasing demand for products in the irrigation field.
Accordingly, based on a proposal put forward by Housing and Construction Minister Sajith Premadasa, the Cabinet granted approval to purchase a Plano Miller and Computer Numerical Control – CNC Machine.
