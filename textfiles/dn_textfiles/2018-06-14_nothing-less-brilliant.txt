NOTHING LESS THAN  BRILLIANT

If I’m ever stranded on a desert island and am given a chance to pick any writer I would like to share the island with I would most probably choose Martin Amis (Ian McEwan comes a close second though). Martin Amis and I have a lot in common. Like me, he is the offspring of an accomplished writer. Like me, he too followed in his father’s footsteps and became a writer. But what fascinates me about him is that unlike me, he is totally immune to the negative comments critics make of his books. If I ever get to meet him I would like to find out if he is really as indifferent to criticism as he shows in public or if its all pretense.
A whole lot of wistful thinking, of course. For Martin Amis currently lives on the other side of the world, in his mother-in-law’s house, a grand, many-storeyed residence in downtown Manhattan. There is little hope our paths would ever cross. Not even if he moves from his present residence, to which he and his wife, the novelist Isabel Fonseca, decamped after a fire wrecked their home, because it is to Brooklyn that they are planning to move. In his characteristic fashion, he and Isabel have, he says, been “lucky in all sorts of ways”. They can almost laugh about the fire now, at least at Isobel’s initial reaction. She was in Florida when it happened, and when Amis called to tell her the house was on fire and there were six fire engines outside, she said, in total panic, “When the firemen come, could you ask them to take off their boots before they go upstairs?”
Today, at the age of sixty-eight, having moved from London to New York, Martin Amis says these days he is working on an autobiographical novel. It won’t, however, be a memoir—he has already written one of those, called Experience, which was published in 2000. Amis describes what he is working on now as a book that falls under the broad umbrella of “life writing”.
This new venture comes as no surprise because Amis has never been just one sort of writer. He is arguably most recognized as the masterful novelist behind Money and London Fields, but he is also an essayist and a critic. His most recent book, The Rub of Time, is evidence of his many talents. The book is a collection of essays, literary criticism, and reportage published in the New Yorker, the Guardian, the Atlantic Monthly, and elsewhere between 1986 and 2017.
Talking about his role as a critic Amis says “When I dispraise,I am usually quoting cliché. When I praise, I am usually quoting the opposed qualities of freshness, energy, and reverberation of voice.” He judges literature by this criterion. In fact, across The Rub of Time he evaluates seemingly everything on the basis of whether it strikes his eyes and ears as fresh or dull. As fate would have it even Jane Austen doesn’t fit his high standards. He is impatient with the worshipers of her “six samey novels,” and says “satire is militant irony. Irony is long-suffering. It doesn’t incite you to transform society; it strengthens you to tolerate it.” This is a quietism that Austen never went beyond, and Amis says he “rather wishes she had.”
In 1999, in an interview with Radio National he succinctly summed up the feelings of the book reviewer. “When you review an exhibition of paintings you don’t compose a painting about it, when you review a film you don’t make a film about it and when you review a new CD you don’t make a little CD about it. But when you review a prose-narrative then you write a prose-narrative about that prose-narrative and those who write the secondary prose-narrative, let’s face it, must have once had dreams of writing the primary prose-narrative.”
Born on August 25, 1949, in Oxford, England, where his father, the Booker Prize–winning author Sir Kingsley Amis, was a doctoral student, Martin Amis grew up in the various university towns in which his father taught literature: Swansea, Princeton and Cambridge. His parents divorced when he was twelve.
At eighteen, a role in the film A High Wind in Jamaica took him to the West Indies. He returned to England in 1968 and, after taking “crammers” he enrolled in Exeter College, Oxford. He graduated with first-class honors in English. In his early twenties, he wrote book reviews for the London Observer and soon thereafter worked as an editorial assistant for The Times Literary Supplement. His first novel,The Rachel Papers, was published in 1973 and received critical acclaim, winning the Somerset Maugham Award (a prize his father had also been awarded). While at the TLS, he published his second novel,Dead Babies(1975), which Auberon Waugh referred to as “nothing less than brilliant.” 
From 1977 to 1980 he served as literary editor of The New Statesman, a socialist weekly, and wrote two more novels, Success(1978) and Other People(1981). In 1984, his best-selling Money appeared, followed by a collection of journalism, The Moronic Inferno (1986), and a collection of short stories, Einstein’s Monsters (1987), which focused on the nuclear threat as did London Fields (1990) where he predicts the death of the planet. One critic described London Fields as “ferociously impressive.” Amis subsequently published another collection of journalism, Visiting Mrs. Nabokov, and a novel, Time’s Arrow (1992).
After his first marriage to Antonia Phillips came to an end in 1993 – he left her for Isobel – Amis has led a life low in drama. He has always been a domestic creature, even when his children were young, preferring to work in the house, as his father, Kingsley did, rather than go to an office. Being a father of four, he says, fatherhood has been vitally important to his life as a novelist. “I did want kids. I was completely fed up with being single as well. I wanted to see a fresh face. Having children can’t help but open you out.”
Asked by the Guardian what kind of parent he was when his kids were young Amis explains he was never a shouter. “Anger isn’t my thing.” When his boys were misbehaving, their mother, his first wife, would tell him to go in and lay down the law, but on the rare occasions he did, it didn’t go well. “Both my wives were capable of having a good shriek, but I can’t do it. It bores me, which is infuriating to my wife.”
If so, how does he express anger? “I have a mannerism that drives my wife crazy.” He laughs, looks away and does a mild tut. But, he says, “I do feel that, along with a harmonious marriage, having a good relationship with your children is the main bit.”
Finally to the most important question of all. How does he remain indifferent in the eye of heavy criticism? His answer is simple even though practicing it might not be easy.
“One of the perks of being the son of a writer is not that you come automatically equipped to write novels, it’s that you don’t bother much about praise. Kingsley never bothered much about praise and dispraise.”
