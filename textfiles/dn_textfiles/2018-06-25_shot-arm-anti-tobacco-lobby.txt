Shot in the arm for anti-tobacco lobby

The country’s anti-tobacco campaign has found new vigour in the light of latest Supreme Court order on the Ceylon Tobacco Company (CTC) to pay for legal costs of a widow of a deceased smoker.
Sri Lanka Medical Association Expert Committee on Tobacco, Alcohol and Illicit Drugs Convenor Dr. Jayamal de Silva said the landmark judgement has set a precedent by which tobacco companies will be held accountable in the future.
The Supreme Court (SC) on June 14 ordered the CTC to pay Rs 400,000 within one month as costs to a smoker’s widow for delaying the trial for more than 12 years by filing petitions in the Appeal Court and the SC. Dismissing a petition by the CTC, the SC ordered to expedite hearing of the case at the Colombo District Court.
De Silva, who is also a Senior Lecturer in Psychiatry at the University of Sri Jayewardenapura, pointed out that this is the first experience in Sri Lanka where a victim of cancer has sued the CTC demanding compensation. He observed that similar individual lawsuits against cigarette manufacturers have become common today in the Western world, especially in the United States.
“Plaintiffs have increasingly been successful in tobacco lawsuits in the USA. There had been instances where they were awarded millions of dollars as compensation. For example, on June 6, 2001, a jury in Los Angeles awarded more than USD 3 billion to a lifelong smoker, deciding that a tobacco giant is responsible for his incurable lung cancer. On March 31, 2009, a widow of a deceased smoker won USD 145 million after a 10-year fight with a tobacco giant as the US Supreme Court dismissed an appeal by that cigarette manufacturing company. Tobacco companies are in the habit of appealing against any judgement unfavourable to them,” he told the Daily News.
Dr de Silva was insistent that tobacco companies must be directly held accountable for the harm their products cause to the people.
“For over half a century now, the tobacco industry has been making deliberate attempts to conceal the fact that smoking causes cancer. Now that it has been proven by scientific evidences, the companies have started ‘selling doubt’ with claims that not all smokers have got cancer and that smokers’ cancer may have been caused by other factors. Sri Lanka has had significant achievements in the recent years in terms of tobacco control policies. Imposing 80 percent pictorial health warnings on the cigarette packets, increasing tax on tobacco to 75 percent or close to that when the effective tax is calculated, and banning the sale of loose tobacco were some such achievements. On top of them, we are hopeful that a landmark judgement on tobacco litigation will drive the country’s anti-smoking campaign to new heights,” he commented.
He also called on the health authorities to effectively implement the recently imposed ban on smoking in public places.
“Our children are exposed to tobacco smoke and ‘live ads’ due to the fact that smoking is allowed in certain public spaces such as sports events and restaurants. The authorities should take serious action to prevent such things happening and enforce the current ban on smoking in public places in an effective manner,” he added.
