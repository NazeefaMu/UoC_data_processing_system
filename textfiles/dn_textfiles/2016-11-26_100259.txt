Du Plessis scandal a storm in a lolly bag

At the outset, I want to dismiss all the fuss around sweets, saliva andshining a cricket ball as a storm in a lolly bag.
I’m happy to admit that I am no academic expert on the impact that sugar can have on the aerodynamics of fast bowling but I’ve played and coached enough cricket to know that the whole thing is a bit ridiculous.
When I was playing, we used to dig into the lolly snakes to keep energy up during a long bowling stint and I’m sure at some stages I would have shined the ball shortly after eating one (or three) without a second thought. And to my knowledge, when I was coaching at Yorkshire there was no specific sweets kept in our dressing room that were earmarked for ball shining.
In county cricket you hear all sorts of theories, but from my experience the players that do the best are the consistent performers – the blokes who can bowl a disciplined line and length for as long as possible, and the batsmen who are patient and stick to their process.
They are the ones who find success, not the ones who have a lot of theories on what’s the best way of shining a cricket ball with a sweet in their mouth.
What did strike me as impressive during that whole saga, which has been driven by the ICC and has nothing to do with the Australian team making any accusations or complaints, was the solidarity the South Africans showed for their captain Faf du Plessis.
They obviously think it’s a load of garbage and have stood firm, as a team and in support of their skipper.
The other point that’s got lost in that debate and the radical shake-up of Australia’s Test and selection personnel is just how well the South Africans have played, especially their pace attack.
Australia have been poor in certain areas, but some of the bowling has been as good as I’ve seen in the past decade of Test cricket. Where they have excelled is what I often referred to as ‘ruthless simplicity’ – keeping it simple and hammering the process. I know the Yorkshire boys used to get sick of me saying ‘process, process, process’, but it’s really important because you don’t want to be thinking of the end result.
The outcome will arrive if you nail the process really well, and I think that’s where Australia have fallen down at times in this series.
As a bowler, what has an even bigger impact than sugary saliva when you’ve got ball in hand is knowing your team’s scored big runs and you’ve got plenty in the bank.
But when you’ve bowled your heart out and then batted poorly, suddenly you’re out there bowling again and that can be very dispiriting andde-motivating. People say you should put the scoreboard out of your mind in that situation, but you wonder if a bit of that gets into the psyche of the bowlers.
Then what they try to do is take a wicket every ball and bowl the magic delivery, as opposed to sticking to the process of that disciplined line and length, and building the pressure, and the knowledge that wickets will come.
The pressure is in them to make an impact and they can try too hard, and when you’re trying things you’re looking beyond what needs to be done to get the outcomes you’re after.
Of course, selection is different and when the team’s is performing as poorly as Australia have of late you have to try new thinking, and new players. So I like the decisions they’ve made to totally revamp the squad for the Adelaide Test and can see the rationale behind those huge changes, even if some of them are a bit unconventional.
