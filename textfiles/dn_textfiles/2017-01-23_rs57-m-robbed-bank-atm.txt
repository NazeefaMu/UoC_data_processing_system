Rs.5.7 m robbed from bank ATM

Robbers entered a bank branch in Bibile and escaped with Rs. 5.7 million from its ATM during the weekend.
Branch manager A.D.S.S. Fernando said they wound up business on Friday after stashing the money away in the ATM to cater to the weekend rush and the thieves had removed the safe containing the money in the ATM after breaking it open by entering the building from the rear door.
Medagama Police said a salesman in a nearby shop had alerted police yesterday morning after seeing the footage in the shop’s CCTV camera which had recorded a man entering the adjoining bank through the back door.
