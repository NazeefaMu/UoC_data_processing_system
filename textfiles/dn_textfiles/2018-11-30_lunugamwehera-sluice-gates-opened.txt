Lunugamwehera sluice gates opened

All sluice gates of the Lunugamwehera reservoir had been opened because the spill level had exceeded 182,000 acre-feet, Tissamaharama Irrigation Engineer Amila Shirantha said. He said as a result of the opening of all sluice gates, 3,200 acre-feet of water per second would be released to Kirindi oya.
As such, residents on either side of the oya should be vigilant, he added.
