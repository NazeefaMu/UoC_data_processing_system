‘Facebook should come under some control’

The Facebook should come under a certain amount of control. This becomes evident when one looks at the recent unrest stoked in the Kandy district by certain social media websites, Fisheries and Aquatic Resources Development Minister and UPFA General Secretary Mahinda Amarawerera said.
The Minister said this in response to a question raised by a group of journalists as to why the government had still not decided on a date to lift the ban on social media websites on March 10.
Minister Amaraweera said developed countries like China had totally banned Facebook. “We in Sri Lanka should introduce some sort of control on Facebook after consulting public opinions,” the Minister said.
“If Facebook was harmless, there was no problem. If it was harmful, we should make some decision about it. I felt they must be controlled. It was better than fully banning it, he said.
