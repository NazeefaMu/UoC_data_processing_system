Over 41,000 dengue cases, 47 deaths by October 30

A total of 41,138 dengue cases and around 47 deaths have been reported from all parts of the country this year by October 30, the Epidemiology Unit sources said.
According to the sources, the highest number of dengue cases - 7,942 - was reported from the Colombo district while the second highest number - 4,463 - was reported from the Gampaha district. The third highest number of dengue cases - 4,356 - was reported from the Batticaloa district.
The Colombo Municipal Council (CMC) reported 1,998 dengue cases during the same period. The other parts of the Colombo district recorded 5,944 dengue cases. The total number of dengue cases reported from the Western Province is 14,925, the epidemiologists said.
Meanwhile, medical experts and consultants advise the public to seek medical treatment without delay for any type of fever without applying home remedies. All fever patients need rest and they should not attend work or school. All fever patients should take Paracetamol only. All other medications, especially Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs (NSAID) such as Ibuprofen cause Dengue Hemorrhagic Fever (DHF) which can become fatal, they said.
People should keep their premises free of dengue mosquito breeding sites during the rainy season to prevent dengue. Even water retained in a pen clip or a bottle top is adequate for dengue mosquitoes to breed, they added.
