Asgiriya Anunayake Thera says  General Election the solution

Whatever people may say about the current situation in the country the best solution to the current problem is to hold a General Election soon, Ven. Anamaduwe Dhammadassi, Anunayake Thera of the Asgiriya Chapter said.
He said everyone was clamouring for a General Election today and even Ranil Wickremesinghe had stated that it was better to hold a General Election soon after the setting up of a lawful government. The Anunayake Thera said there would not be any upheavals within the next week since the President had promised to resolve the existing political problems within a week and Parliamentary sessions had also been postponed by a week.
He said even though the UNP had created a din in Parliament, it had lost mass support among the public.
The people need not be disturbed about the existing crisis since the administration was engaged in finding plausible solutions to it.
He said the current period was an extraordinary one which would go down in the country’s history because the country was governed by a single ruler for the first time after the period of the Sinhala Kings. He said the President seemed to be finding pragmatic solutions to problems.
