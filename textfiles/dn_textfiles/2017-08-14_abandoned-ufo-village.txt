Abandoned UFO village

These creepy images show an abandoned UFO village where wacky spaceship-style homes have been left to rot and grow mouldy.
The yellow and green flying-saucer homes are elevated above ground, with all the amenities of a regular home designed in a circular pod.
Once filled with the hustle and bustle of family life and tourists on holiday , the homes, officially knows as Futuro houses, grew incredibly popular in the 1960s.
Now, images from the village in the Wanli district of Taiwan show crumbling exteriors, cracked windows and mouldy carpets after decades of decay.
While considered the perfect living space by many, the spaceship homes designed by Finnish architect Matti Suuronen were thought to be an horrendous eye sore by others.
The pods were originally designed as ski chalets, made from lightweight material so they could be transported between various locations.
Resembling something from a sci-fi film, doors and windows of the alternative properties are based on the design of an aircraft and the indoor living spaces are made up of a kitchen, bedroom and bathroom.
But as oil prices soared, the once-fashionable homes and holiday cabins became unaffordable and were left to crumble and rot to the ground.
Along with the Futuro homes, Matti Suuronen also designed a series of Venturo pre-fab houses.
While Suuronen is best known for his futuristic homes, he has also designed petrol stations, kiosks, detached and terraced homes as well as public buildings.
