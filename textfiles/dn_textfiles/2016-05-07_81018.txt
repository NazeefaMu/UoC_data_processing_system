Join us, deputy minister tells SLFP MPs in JO

The SLFP MPs in the Joint Opposition are not with the racist sections in it. We invite them to get back with the SLFP, Judiciary and Buddhasasana Deputy Minister Dushmantha Mithrapala said.
He was addressing the media at the Government Information Department Auditorium yesterday. Mithrapala said the Joint Opposition was cultivating racism freely.
Now all ethnicities are with the SLFP as the President is not a racist. Over 24 leaders from other ethnic groups participated in the SLFP's Galle May Day rally. This is the first time they participated in a SLFP May Day rally, he said.
"We will not let anybody break the SLFP," the deputy minister said.
Finance State Minister Lakshman Yapa Abeywardana said the country and the government will protect all leaders in the country and no leader will be discriminated when it comes to security.
The current President has the biggest threat as the LTTE tried to kill him on five occasions, he said.
Holding a May Day rally with Douglas Devananda does not mean that the President approves a federal state.
The President clearly rejected the idea of a federal state and dividing the country, he said.
Talking about the exchange of blows in Parliament and the vote on the Supplementary Appropriation Bill, he said when the media shows the people how their representatives behave in Parliament, the public will take a decision on them.
A well organised group which met in a house at Madiwela, waited for the 'correct time’ and stormed into Parliament and pick pocketed the vote on Supplementary Appropriation Bill. It is duty of all MPs to be in Parliament during the two weeks of each month and do their duty without wasting public money, Abeywardana said.
