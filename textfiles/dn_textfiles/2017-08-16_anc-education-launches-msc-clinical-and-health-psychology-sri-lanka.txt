ANC Education launches MSc in clinical and health psychology in Sri Lanka

ANC School of Postgraduate Education launched its MSc in Clinical and Health Psychology and MBA with Hospitality Management programmes in Sri Lanka, at a ceremony held recently at Taj Samudra Colombo.
ANC Education in collaboration with the University of West London (UWL) now offers British postgraduate qualifications in Psychology and Hospitality that can be completed entirely in Sri Lanka within a period of 12 – 15 months.
For the first time, this enables local students to obtain foreign undergraduate to postgraduate qualifications in psychology and hospitality without the need to go abroad for studies - and for a much lower cost.
Being in the education industry for over 15 years, ANC Education understands the growing demand for high caliber professionals in the field of psychology and hospitality, both locally and internationally. In Sri Lanka, there’s a huge shortage of professionals in psychology, especially clinical psychologists – which creates more demand for qualified professionals in the industry. Thereby, ANC Education introduces the new array of programs to give exclusive advantage to local students determined to prosper in life and career.
Strengthening the years-old UWL-ANC partnership, Vice Chancellor of the UWL Prof. Peter John graced the launch ceremony as the Chief Guest.
Speaking at the event, he admired ANC Education’s commitment to educating the future generation of leaders, in-line with the UWL’s vision and mission.
Announcing the launch of the new postgraduate programmes, CEO and Executive Director of ANC Education Dr. Punarjeeva Karunanayake said, ANC Education is extremely happy to once again introduce an array of British postgraduate programs from the UWL – which is an outstanding career focused university. “We are pleased to announce that the UWL-ANC collaboration now celebrates five years.  These degrees are internal degrees from the UWL that adhere to the highest standards of the U.K. Quality Assurance Agency. With these qualifications, our graduates will be poised to enter lucrative careers in the fast-growing and in-demand fields – ready to make a positive shift in the world,” he added.  
At the launch, Chairman of ANC Education Dr Jagath Alwis also spoke of the ANC-UWL partnership and how it has strengthened over the years. “ANC School of Postgraduate Education has grown steadily through the past few years, offering the largest portfolio of British postgraduate programs in law and business in Sri Lanka. We now take great pride in adding more to that portfolio, by introducing postgraduate qualifications in psychology and hospitality to the Sri Lankan education platform,” he said.
Speaking of the newly introduced MBA with Hospitality Management, Academic Head of ANC Education Postgraduate Business Programmes Marcelline Alexander stated that the program is designed to build on students’ previous managerial experience. “The course provides students with highly relevant practical content and professional skills that are much-sought after in the services and hospitality industry.
