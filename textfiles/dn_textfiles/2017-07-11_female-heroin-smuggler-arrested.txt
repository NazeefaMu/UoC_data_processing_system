Female heroin smuggler arrested

A woman with 1,910 mg of heroin hidden in her pudendum, was arrested by the Anti-Narcotic Division of Galle Police on a tip-off from the public.
The Police, at first, failed to detect drugs hidden in suspect’s body; however, subsequently, female police officers assigned to check her detected the drugs. Further investigations revealed that the husband of the suspect is also in prison for similar offences and she had also been arrested by Police on several occasions.
