Waves, Whales and Water

No matter the distance and no matter the weather condition, when you need to check out the latest hotspots in the country that you can escape to when you need that special getaway – you just do it.
Last weekend, Weligama was all hyped with music, fireworks and fire dancers as it opened doors to a brand new boutique property to promote the beauty and beach front surroundings of the southern coastal Sri Lanka.
W15 Weligama is indeed the latest boutique property that is already making waves in that area from the day of its soft opening couple of months back. A cocktail reception was held to celebrate their success and the unveiling to VIPs from embassies, ministries and the media.
I got together with Isabel Jamaldeen who is the lovely Managing Director at W15 to get to know more of what they have to offer to their guests here and from around the world.
Q: Who owns this property?
A: Controlling share is owned by Hardy Jamaldeen with an overseas Investor owning the rest of the shares in the company. Steradian Capital Investments (Pvt) Limited is the manager. We have our own in-house team looking after the operations at W15 with me as the MD.
Q: Why did you’ll pick Weligama?
A: Weligama is an amazing, all year round destination, not just for surf lovers. The beaches are calm with beautiful waves to enjoy. We absolutely love the bay, it is still fairly undeveloped, has lots of natural beauty and charm. W15 is located on the perfect spot right in the middle of the bay, with breathtaking views.
Q: Who came up with the name W15 and what was the reason behind it?
A: We (Hardy and I) were looking for an unusual name that people would remember easily. We were looking for something “edgy” and short. The “W” stands for Weligama, the “WoW” factor, and the Wonderful feeling you associate a beach property like Whales, Water and Waves. The “15” is short for 2015, its year of our launch.
Q: How do you stand unique from the rest of the boutique hotels in that coastal area?
A: W15 has a unique charisma. It’s an exclusive boutique hotel with picturesque seascape that is situated right in the middle of Weligama Bay. The architecture of the building itself is far from the colonial style found throughout the island.
With its clear lines it reflects the stylish and fresh artistic touch that differentiates itself from most other properties. We put the highest possible attention to customer needs and try and make every guest experience a unique one. Our staff is happy and proud to be part of the W15 family and no request is too much.
Q: Speaking of the staff…are they from the nearby area or from Colombo as well?
A: Most of our staff members are from the local area. They are proud to be working for W15 and for us it is most important to make them part of the family. We value each and every team member and are happy to have so many great people working for us.
Q: What sort of cuisine do you’ll cater to the guests?
A: The W15 kitchen specializes in amazing seafood dishes with so much variety of fish and seafood right available at its shore. Our signature dishes are the Seafood Platter, Seafood Spaghetti Marinara or the Seafood Pizza.
We also serve the classic dishes like an amazing Beef Burger, Nasi Goreng or mouthwatering sandwiches. There is a lovely mix of different dishes to appeal to every guest. Our head chef takes great joy in cooking special dishes requested by the guests to spice up the menu choice.
Q: Anything else planned for the property in the near future…any upgrades… additions? Also will you be opening more boutiques of this sort anywhere else in the island?
A: We are proud and happy to be open for the first high season and are focusing on creating the most wonderful guest experiences. The bigger picture will definitely include more properties around the island, so watch out for more to come.

As you walk in, you are welcomed by a pathway that leads to the pool, green lawn and then the beach front. On your left you will find the bar and al-fresco dining area.
All ten rooms - one executive suite, four ocean view deluxe rooms, four superior double rooms and one standard double room are unique in every way. There’s a balance between modern and traditional interior décor along with modern amenities - Flat screen TV with cable, Wi-Fi, IDD telephones and mini bar facilities, king-sized beds, plush couches and rugs paired with patterned cushions and printed sheets. Some rooms have four-poster beds while the other rooms have sofa beds - ideal for a group or family stay.

W15 also arrange excursions for whale watching, visits to tea estates Madolduwa and Madu Ganga, and historical sites such as the Kusthiraja Gala temple. And if you’re into surfing, well it’s the best location to get your surfs up. You can get your surf boards from the hotel.
So get booking and enjoy the Wow factor of W15!
