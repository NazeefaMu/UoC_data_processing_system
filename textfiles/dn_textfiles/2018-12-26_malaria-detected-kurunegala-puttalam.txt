Malaria detected in Kurunegala, Puttalam

Three malaria positive patients were detected recently from Kurunegala and Puttalam and the NWP Malaria Control Unit officers said pilgrims who visit India may be possible vectors. Sri Lanka has only two categories of mosquitoes that spread malaria but other countries have over 10. Residents in the Kurunegala and Puttalam Districts battle against the disease now.
Those who visit foreign countries from Sri Lanka should get the guidance and medical advice of the Malaria Control Unit, its OIC Devika Perera said at a media briefing held in Kurunegala yesterday.
