Little Mix keen for a Fifth Harmony collaboration

Little Mix are eyeing up a collaboration with rival girl group Fifth Harmony.
The two bands both rule the charts with their catchy tunes and have a similar history when it comes to band beginnings. Both were formed on The X Factor, with Little Mix coming together on the British version in 2011 and Fifth Harmony emerging from the short-lived US show the following year.
When asked by metro.co.uk if they’d be up for joining forces to create the ultimate super group, Little Mix singer Perrie Edwards said she’d jump at the chance. “Yes! Imagine the sass,” she grinned, while bandmate Jade Thirlwall added: “The hair whips would be off the scale.”
Little Mix, also made up of Jesy Nelson and Leigh-Anne Pinnock, recently wrapped up their five month Get Weird Tour, taking in dates all around the world.
There’s been no rest for the foursome though, as they’ve been working hard on their fourth album.
“It’s going to be a lot dancier,” Perrie promised of the next record.
Along with their musical achievements, Little Mix has a make-up and perfume line and are also working with sportswear giant USA Pro on activewear lines.
As for what’s left on their bucket list, Jesy has ambitions to play Wembley Stadium, following in the footsteps of artists like Beyonce and Michael Jackson.
“Oh god we’d love to,” Jesy smiled. “I mean yeah, it can only really get there can’t it? The tours are getting bigger so that’s what we’d like to aim for.”
