‘Smart City’ or Megalopolis!

When Minister Champika Ranawaka mentioned that he wants to build Smart Cities in Sri Lanka, just as he assumed duties in his new ministry, the Ministry of Megalopolis and Western Province Development at Sethsiripaya couple of weeks after taking oath as a Minister, I knew,being present there, no one understood the real meaning what a ‘Smart City’ or a ‘Sabuddhimath Nagara’ in Sinhalese really meant.
This went into the print and electronic media islandwide the following day.
On September 4,2015 when the new Cabinet of the United National Front was sworn in, Champika Ranavaka got the portfolio as the Minister of ‘Megapolis and Western Province Development'. Many people called and asked me ‘Hey, Champika is asked to handle a new Police, what is it?’ I jokingly said ‘Yes, as he is a Nationalist, He is being asked to ‘Police’ the unpatriotic Sinhalese in a Mega manner'.
According to Wikipedia, British Dictionary, Random House Dictionary and The Thesaurus all state that the word ‘Megapolis’ is wrong and should be ‘Megalopolis'. This is a conjoined Greek word meaning super large or an exaggerated massiveness Megalo + another Greek word for city, ‘Polis.
Simply put, ‘Megalopolis is a region made up of several large cities and their surrounding areas in sufficient proximity and joined, to be considered a single urban complex’ is what a Megalopolis really is.
This was was written by Sir Patrik Geddes, born in 1854 in Scotland, in his book ‘Cities in Evolution'.
He was supposed to be the first ever conceptualizer on Urban Planning and Sociology and was also involved in the forming of one of the world's largest Universities, the University of Mumbai.
Keeping aside the Megalopolis concept, let us see what a Smart City is. ‘A smart city uses digital technologies or information and communication technologies (ICT) to enhance quality and performance of urban services, to reduce costs and resource consumption, and to engage more effectively and actively with its citizens'.
This is the basic definition given about a Smart City. It is solely based on the Internet or Digital Technology or Information Communication Technology (ICT) as shown above.
The basic sections included are, Government Services, Transport and Traffic Management, Energy, Health Care, Water and Waste Management. According to Wikipedia other names for a Smart City are ‘Cyberville, ‘Digital City'’, ‘Electronic Communities’, ‘Flexicity’, ‘Information City’, ‘Intelligent City’, ‘Knowledge-based City, ‘Mesh City’, ‘Telecity, ‘Teletopia’, ‘Ubiquitous City’, ‘Wired City'& as Champikasaid in Singhala, ‘SabuddhimathNagara’ (Super Intelligent Cities).
A Smart City is defined in many ways.Deakin says the following criteria should be met. 1. The application of a wide range of electronic and digital technologies to communities and cities. 2. The use of ICT to transform life and working environments within the region. 3. The embedding of such ICTs in government systems. 4. The territorialisation of practices that brings ICTs and people together to enhance the innovation and knowledge that they offer.
Some say ‘A smart city is one that has digital technology embedded across all city functions. In any case it is a city with all digital signals, the 0s and the 1sscrambled, going across the city.
Though these are supposed to be Intelligent Cities, they are in fact artificial Intelligence all geared up. But, I say it is somewhat similar to the human body.
The Digital Communication network is like the Nerves. The Embedded Chips or the Intelligence is the Brain. Sensors situated all over the city resembles the Sensory Organs of ours, while the Software to drive the artificial Intelligence is our Knowledge.
In a Smart City,Information Technology should be used to make more efficient use of the Physical Infrastructure such as Network of Roads, Buildings etc for the betterment of humans socially & culturally through Artificial Intelligence.
Through e-governance to engage the citizens in their participation in a practical & an efficient manner thus making local governance more productive.
The 1st ever Smart City - The Bletchley Park in Buckinghamshire, UK.
The 1st ever Smart City is supposed to be the Bletchley Park in Buckinghamshire, UK, established in 1938 to decode Nazi messages. It was used by UK's Government Code& Cypher School to decipher Hitler's military messages & codes. It is said that if not for the work done at Bletchley Park, the war would have gone on for 2 more years.
In the Smart City context, the above example of Bletchley Park is called 1.'Orchestration Intelligence’ where cities base institutions & communities for problem solving. Next we have the 2.'Empowerment Intelligence’ where cities offer open platforms, facilities to experiment and infrastructure included in Smart Cities to innovate and experiment.
These can be seen in places such as Kista Science City in Stockholm and the Cyberport Zone in Hong Kong as well as in Melbourne. City infrastructure is made ‘smart’ through real time data collection and is known as 'Instrumentation Intelligence'.
Instrumentation Intelligence in Amsterdam is done through having a common IP structure for researchers to develop applications and wireless meters and devices transmitting data. Some homes have been provided with Smart Energy meters. Energy saving lamps, car recharging devices and solar power garbage compactors add to the list.
Smart Cities are needed for ‘Governance'. Enriching the quality of life through e-governance allowing administration services to the citizens and participating directly in governance.
'Urban Infrastructure’ such as transport, all utilities, protection of the environment and safety through Smart Cities are also anticipated. ‘Innovation and the economy’ too are enhanced through new innovations in all forms, education, health and the creation of knowledge intensive companies.
A Smart City should be equipped with new Internet technologies such as Cloud Based Services, Smart Phones, Smart Utility Meters, Radio Frequency Identification methods known as RFID and IoT or the Internet of Things.
The phrase ‘Internet of Things’ was coined by British entrepreneur Kevin Ashton in 1999.Typically, IoT is expected to offer advanced connectivity of devices, systems, and services that goes beyond machine-to-machine communications (M2M)and covers a variety of protocols, domains, and applications.
RFIDs have a great job to do in a Smart City. From embedding a transponder in a Child's uniform or a school bag, to managing farm animals, to having these on vehicles is a must. I will be doing an article on the great value of RFIDs later on.
In the city of Santander in Spain, more than 20,000 sensors connecting buildings, transport networks, utilities and infrastructure facilities make life easy for the citizens. These sensors monitor traffic, pollution and parking.
E-cards or Smart Cards are another innovative method to make life easy in a Smart City. It has an ID number where the holder can communicate with the governance to get data and to personally interact with different government establishments using one ID number dedicated to him. This is implemented in Southampton, UK. We can use the NIC with a Smart Chip embedded.
This should have been done before the Passports.
Research and Development inside Smart Cities would encourage innovators to design, conceptualize and provide the starting point for manufacturing of items. IT tools can be used for making platforms for e-governance and citizen participation.
In 2003-10-17, 12 years ago, I penned an article ‘Singapore Syndrome’ (Daily News) regarding E-governance and a ‘Smart City with regards to the Internet of Things which was ‘Abracadabra’ for the Lankans.
I suggested embedding a Smart Chip in the NIC, to be used especially for anti crime work and to keep a track of citizens when going from one Jurisdiction to another. If you are not guilty of any crime or offence why worry!Privacy is different to the guilty conscience.
Amsterdam initiated the modern day Smart City project in 2009. Flexible street lighting which allows municipalities to control the brightness of street lights, and smart traffic management where traffic is monitored in real time by the City and information about current travel time on certain roads is broadcast to allow motorists to determine the best routes to take.
Various projects are done by the citizens, departments and companies collaborating together on a single platform.
In Barcelona, where an emergency is reported, the approximate route of the emergency vehicle is entered into the traffic light system, setting all the lights to green as the vehicle approaches through a mix of GPS and traffic management software, allowing emergency services to reach the incident without delay.
Now lets look at our neighbour India's Smart City initiative. The Delhi Master Plan for 2021 by the Delhi Development Authority which was initiated by Prime Minister Narendra Modi.
The building construction is undertaken by the National Building Construction Corporation of India and hopes to complete it in 3 years time. A 100 story building is in the offing. Spain has signed an agreement with India for the start of a Smart City. USA plans to start 3 with Germany 1 more in India.
Japan who was a late starter on Smart Cities has 4 towns in the making. City of Yokohama, Toyota City, Keihanna(combining Kyoto, Osaka and Nara) Science City in Kyoto and the City of Kita Kyushu.
City of Yokohama is demonstrating how the level of reduction in peak power demand changes with the provision of information and the offering of incentives.
They targeted 3,500 households which is the largest for in Japan. As part of the Yokohama Smart City Project (YSCP), a V2H (vehicle to home) system was developed such that storage batteries in electric vehicles (EV) were charged with electric power from home Photovoltaic (PV) power generation systems and conversely the storage batteries supplied electric power to homes. The V2H experiment would be a good starter for Sri Lankan Homes.
Keihanna Science City is experimenting with an Eco City project. Experiments were done on 14 houses in energy saving through the use of Photovoltaic cells and Storage batteries coupled with a Home Energy Management System or HEMS.
The objectives of the experiment were to reduce energy consumption and CO2 emissions and to respond to peak demand reduction and electric power supply.
Toyota City, the home of the Toyota Motors, have started a successful ‘Low Carbon Society’ system reducing Carbon Footprint.
Smart Mobility and Energy Life project is thriving to produce a low carbon atmosphere. Toyota Smart City covers about 929 SqKms with a population of about 422,830 as at 2012.
They are also targeting a ‘Low Carbon Transport System’ using Plug In Hybrids (PHV)& Electric Vehicles (EV). Based on the Innovation Cities Index, here are the top 10 smart cities in the world to date.
1-Vienna
Vienna was the only city that ranked in the top 10 in every category in the'Innovation Cities Index'. It is well ahead of the pack in establishing brave smart-city targets and tracking their progress, in particular with programs like the ‘Smart Energy Vision 2050’, ‘Roadmap 2020’, and ‘Action Plan 2012-2015'.
2-Toronto
The highest rated smart city in North America, Toronto scores quite well across the board.
The big names in Technology recognize this too - IBM recently opened a Business Analytics Solutions Center in the city and Toronto is also an active member of C40 megacities.
3-Paris
Another European city representing connectivity to counterparts. Paris was highly rated in several categories including innovation, green cities in Europe, and digital governance.
Paris was already on the world map for its highly successful bike sharing program, Velib, and it is following up this success with a similar scheme for Electric Vehicles (EV).
4-New York
New York scored higher than most other cities in the ranking in all of the categories.
New York partnered with IBM in 2009 to launch the ‘IBM Business Analytics Solution Center’ to address “the growing demand for the complex capabilities needed to build smarter cities and help clients optimize all manner of business processes and business decisions.”
5-Stockholm
Home to the HQ of Ericsson, pioneers of the ‘Networked Society’, Stockholm scores highly on the Innovation Cities Index for obvious reasons; it has a long track record of focused initiatives to drive the progress of ICT infrastructure. Stockholm was also the first city in the world to introduce 4G/LTE mobile services.
6-London
The UK capital also scored relatively high across the board. London has been well-recognized for some of its sustainability innovations i.e. congestion tax and its robust transport system.
The city is home to Smart Cities research center housed at Imperial College, which focuses on initiatives in hope of making the city more efficient and innovative.
7-Tokyo
Tokyo is the first Asian city on this list, scoring well in both the innovation and digital city categories. In 2011, the city announced plans to create a smart town in the suburbs. In partnership with Panasonic, Accenture, and Tokyo Gas, the eco suburb will contain homes that integrate solar panels, storage batteries, and energy efficient appliances all connected to a smart grid.
8-Berlin
Berlin also performs well across the board, with good scores in innovation and green-ness.
One of the most interesting initiatives Berlin has focused on a collaboration with BMW.
Together, they are testing out vehicle-to-grid (V2G)technologies in the hopes of creating a virtual power plant from electric vehicles.
9-Hong Kong
Hong Kong scored quite well in key areas, Hong Kong is experimenting withRadio Frequency Identification (RFID) technology in its airport, as well as throughout the agriculture supply chain.
The city has also been a leader in the adoption of smart cards, which are already used by millions of residents for services like public transit, library access, building access, shopping, and car parks.
10-Barcelona
Barcelona was recently ranked the number two smart city in Spain in the IDC report. The city is a pioneer in smart city and low-carbon solutions.
It was among the first in the world to introduce a solar thermal ordinance about a decade ago.
This list is sure to evolve; expect smart cities to become a sizable market, with projections of nearly $40 billion spent on smart-city technologies by 2016.
It is also assumed that 70% of the world's population will live in cities by 2020. The idea of so many people living in such close proximity is a prospect much easier to envision if most cities are moving towards being truly connected.
So, when will Sri Lanka enter this list? Through my research on Smart Cities, one more criteria was that a Smart City should have ‘Smart People'. Would the never ending chatter of a falsified pride of that 2,500 year old history by the majority of the masses bring disaster to the dreams of the lovers of living in futuristic townships and mega development for a cool living?To live peacefully in serenity without the death knell of the Claxons and the Beat of the Vikings and the Exhaust Pipes and the Mobile Discos of the Bajajs and the cacophony of Mahajana Sampatha and the yelling of Yakada Katas belonging to almighties be it Yellow, Green or Black.
My grandmother told me that speech is Silver and silence is Gold and also that the empty vessels make the most sound. It took me half a century to realize it happening right here in my motherland.
But, if Smart Cities are a dream to be implemented in Sri Lanka, forget fulfilling it, as long as the Bajajs, the Vikings and the Defenders along with the Ghantaras and the Thrishoolas exist. Good luck to you my good friend the Minister of Megalopolis and Western Province Development! Good luck to all of us! Let's change! Let's try!Lets have at least one Smart Zero Crime Grama NiladhariVasama here in Sri Lanka to start off with, where citizens could really live in peace and serenity and get their day to day work done sans any politicization, bureaucracy or red tape.
