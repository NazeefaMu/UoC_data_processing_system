Minister denies allegations regarding Private Secretary

Finance and Mass Media Minister Mangala Samaraweera in a media release yesterday strongly denied allegations that the Minister’s Private Secretary, Ruwan Ferdinandez has been removed from his post.
He stated that Ferdinandez had acquired prior approval a few months ago to undertake a foreign trip and was scheduled to return to the country next week. Thereafter, he would promptly report to work, explained the minister.
Minister Samaraweera further observed that he had no desire nor was he in the habit of removing officers who have served him in his political work, loyally over a number of years based on unfounded allegations spouted by certain websites.
Websites have also reported that Minister Samaraweera had asked the CID to investigate into his private secretary in his alleged involvement in the disappearance of journalist Prageeth Ekneligoda. They alleged that this was after Ferdinandez wrote a letter to the minister asking for an investigation to clear his name.
Ferdinandez’s name was brought into the limelight after the website lankaenews.com reported that he was involved in the disappearance of Ekneligoda.
