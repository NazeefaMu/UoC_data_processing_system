Bus strike called off

The Private Bus Owners’ Unions called off their planned bus strike following talks with Transport and Civil Aviation Deputy Minister Ashok Abeysinghe last evening.
Private Bus Owners’ Association President Gemunu Wijeratne said the strike was called off temporarily. It has been agreed at the meeting to increase the bus fares by 12.5 percent and increase the minimum fare from Rs 10 to Rs 12.
Ministry Media Secretary Viraj Abeysinghe speaking to the Daily News yesterday said the above revisions have to be approved at the next Cabinet meeting on May 22. He said the Unions agreed to suspend trade union action till next Tuesday.
He said the Unions demanded a bus fare hike of 15 percent, but the Ministry could negotiate it to a 12.5 percent increase.
