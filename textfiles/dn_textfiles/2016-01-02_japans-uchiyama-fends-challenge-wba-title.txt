Japan's Uchiyama fends off challenge to WBA title

 
TOKYO, THURSDAY: Undefeated champion Takashi Uchiyama of Japan on Thursday successfully defended his World Boxing Association super featherweight title for the 11th time, beating Nicaraguan Oliver Flores with a technical knockout.
Uchiyama (24-0-1, 20 knockouts) went into the New Year's Eve bout clearly at ease against his challenger, 24.
Victory for the veteran Japanese titleholder, 36, came quickly -- one minute and 47 seconds into the third round -- when a single left body blow put the Nicaraguan fighter flat on the canvas.
It was a technical knockout as Flores (27-2-2, 17 knockouts) was declared no longer capable of continuing to fight before the end of the count.
"I am in very good condition," Uchiyama said after the bout. "I tried to take it easy in the first few rounds."
The headline bout was part of a WBA doubleheader at Ota Ward General Gymnasium in Tokyo. AFP
