Gemunu requests for Rs.5,000 fine on beggars,traders in buses

Lanka Private Bus Owners’ Association (LPBOA) president Gemunu Wijeratne has asked that a minimum fine of Rs.5,000 be imposed on those begging and selling goods in buses.
Wijeratne in a letter addressed to the Transport Minister Nimal Siripala de Silva asked that the Motor Traffic Act of 1951 which is currently in the process of being amended also include a clause of imposing a fine to the ban of begging and doing business inside buses.
“The Act specifies begging and selling goods inside buses to be a crime but it has not prescribed a punishment for it. The Act thus cannot be implemented,”he explained.
“We receive many complaints of these beggars and sellers harassing commuters. At time these sellers pick pocket the passengers while selling their goods,” he added.
