JO has numbers to form govt - Prasanna Ranatunga

Since the required Parliamentary majority is available, the Joint Opposition has no doubt about the formation of a government under the leadership of Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa, Parliamentarian Prasanna Ranatunga said.
The damage caused to the country by the UNP by steering it into a grave economic crisis during last three years could not be considered minimal. Only a government led by Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa is able to rescue the country from the current economic plight, he said.
Ranatunga was speaking to a group of Joint Opposition activists at a meeting in Minuwangoda yesterday. The ending of UNP rule, which sent war heroes to the gallows, robbed the Treasury and damaged national security was a great victory achieved by the people, he said.
Ranatunga said they were always in the forefront of the movement to make Mahinda Rajapaksa the Prime Minister.
They had asked the people to ensure their victory at the local government election pledging to make Mahinda Rajapaksa the Prime Minister and now they had fulfilled that pledge.
The time has come to serve the people by ushering in development and uplifting the country’s economy.
The UNP which treated the alleged plot to assassinate President Maithripala Siripala and Gotabhaya Rajapaksa lightly tried to divide the country by bringing in a new constitution. Today all those conspiracies have been defeated, Ranatunga said.
