Medhira takes girls  under-18 crown

 
Sri Lanka Fed Cup player fourth seed Medhira Samarasinghe beat number one rank Anika Seneviratne 3-6, 6-2, 6-1 to win the girls under-18 final at the 101st Junior National Tennis Championship worked off at the Sri Lanka Tennis Association’s (SLTA) hard courts at Green Path in Colombo yesterday.
The 17-year-old girl from Ladies College put up a clinical display in building up her victory. Her young14-year-old opponent Anika also from Ladies College failed to cross the final frontier though she had a fantastic tournament overall. She took the first set easily by 6-3 and led again in the second set but lost four very close points which went to 40-40 and eventually lost the set.
In the second and third sets Anika started to made many errors and crumbled due to fatigue. Medhira took advantage of it and used her ample experience to pull herself through to win in three hours.
