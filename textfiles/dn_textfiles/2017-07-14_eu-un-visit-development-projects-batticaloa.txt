EU, UN visit development projects in Batticaloa

The European Union, represented by Libuse Soukupova, Head of Cooperation of the EU Delegation to Sri Lanka and the Maldives and Mohamed Muzain, Programme Manager, UNDP, visited a Traditional Food Sale Centre located in Chenkalady village. The centre which operates with the sole aim of increasing entrepreneurial skills of women has been built through the financial support of the EU-SDDP and implemented by the UNDP. There are currently 30 women who sell traditional foods using locally produced agro-based products.
The purpose of the support has been to increase the living standards of women as well as to create more work opportunities and better income for the poor and marginalized communities, particularly women.
During the visit to Chenkalady, the EU and UN team also visited the newly renovated Fishermen Business Centre.
The renovation has been supported by the EU-SDDP and the project has been implemented by the UNDP and is expected to benefit the members of the Chenkalady Coastal Fisheries Welfare Federation.
With renovated ice plant facilities and activities such as capacity building of women and youth in entrepreneurship and marketing management, the centre aims at benefiting more than 4,800 families, while enhanced income generation activities will reach at least 20,000 people.
Also during the visit to Batticaloa, 90 graduates who have successfully completed training on heavy equipment operation and modern dressmaking were awarded certificates at the Vocational Training Authority of Sri Lanka (VTASL).
This initiative, in collaboration with Sri Lanka Institute of Textiles and Apparels (SLITA) and Vocational Training Authority of Sri Lanka, has been implemented by the ILO with EU-SDDP support.
Libuse Soukupova together with Nina Brandstrup who is the Representative of the FAO also attended the ceremonial opening of the Multi-Species Marine Finfish Hatchery in Tharmapuram, supported through the EU-SDDP.
The Hatchery was inaugurated by the Minister of Fisheries Mahinda Amaraweera. The project has been implemented by FAO with the aim to fulfill the national requirement for the development of marine finfish farming in the country.
The Hatchery has a capacity to produce four million fingerlings annually and is the largest marine finfish hatchery in Sri Lanka.
The establishment of the hatchery will facilitate the development of marine aquaculture in the Eastern Province and islandwide, where fingerlings can be provided to fishers to further embark on marine pen, cage or pond culture.
