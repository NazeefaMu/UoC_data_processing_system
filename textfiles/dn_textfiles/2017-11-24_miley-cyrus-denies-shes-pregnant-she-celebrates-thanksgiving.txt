Miley Cyrus denies she's pregnant as she celebrates Thanksgiving birthday

 
For Miley Cyrus, Thanksgiving marks a double celebration this year; it's her birthday!
The singer and The Voice coach turned 25 on Thursday and posted on her Instagram page the night before a photo of herself getting ready for a big day of eating; She is wearing a loose-fitting T-shirt and patting her belly, which sparked speculation among fans that she might be pregnant.
However, her caption signaled nothing but a food baby. She also later posted on Instagram Stories, "Not pregnant, just eating a s--t ton of Tofurky...RUDE!!!!"
"So close to b-day time! Stoked for a day full of Tofurkey & loved ones! Ain't it ironic? #VeganTurkeyBaby," Cyrus wrote.
And do we spy Liam Hemsworth? We do! Her 27-year-old fiancé's reflection is seen in a mirror.
