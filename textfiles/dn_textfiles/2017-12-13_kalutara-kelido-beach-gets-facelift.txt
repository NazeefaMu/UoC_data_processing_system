Kalutara Kelido Beach gets facelift

“Kelido Beach strip which attracted hundreds and thousands of local and foreign tourists, is polluted and becoming little by little a less-attractive area, due to various human illegal activities, and we should get together to transform it into a fascinating and useful tourist attraction” said the Kalutara district (UNP) Parliamentarian and the Kalutara District Coordinating Officer Lakshman Ananda Wijemanna, recently. He expressed these ideas at a discussion held at Kalutara district Secretariat Auditorium attended by the Tourism promotion Minister John Amaratunga, with the participation of the Kalutara District Planning Director Siriwardena recently. Wijemanna spoke about the need and importance of setting up of a tourist Police and sufficient number of sanitation facilities, within the Kelido Beach Area, in the Kalutara town. The Minister gave his approval to train several ‘Beach Boys’ as tourist guides as well. Wijemanna pointed out the importance of arranging the necessary seating facilities, for tourists and growing ‘Benthamburu’ plants to prevent the Beach sand from getting washed with the sea waves. Several Grama Niladharis who participated in the discussion, requested the Minister to make Financial allocations to equip the Kelido Beach, with these necessary requirements and facilities as soon as possible, within the next year.
