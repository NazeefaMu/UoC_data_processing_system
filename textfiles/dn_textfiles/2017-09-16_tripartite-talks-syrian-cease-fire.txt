Tripartite talks on Syrian cease-fire

Russia, Turkey and Iran held a fresh round of talks were in Astana, Capital of Kazakhstan on September 14 -15 to agree on four de-escalation zones prior to the forthcoming ceasefire talks with the Syrian Government and some Opposition groups.
These three states collaborated with the Syrian military in the war against the Islamic State rebels. It was the main factor that led to the weakening of the IS rebels. Syrian military victories and the in-fighting among various rebel groups had thwarted US and other Western attempts to oust the Assad regime and install the Opposition in power.
Now neither the US nor its allies call for the non-participation of the Syrian Government in the peace talks as they used to do earlier. They have quietly reconciled to the position that its presence in the talks is inevitable.
Syrian Army
Iranian Revolutionary Guards played a key role in the ground fighting while the turning point in the war came with the aerial support given to ground forces of the regime by the Russian Air Force.
With the capture of Aleppo, the foremost rebel stronghold, the Syrian military took the upper hand in the war. Now the number of defectors is increasing among the rebel forces. Most of them are fleeing to neighbouring countries. Last Thursday 1,000 militants crossed over to the Syrian Army together with seven field commanders. Their transfer was arranged by the Reconciliation Center established by the Russian Defence Ministry.
With the fall of Mosul in Iraq last February, Syrian rebels became further weakened. On September 5 the Syrian Army liberated Deir ez – Zor, held by the rebels since 2014. Raqqa, the last rebel stronghold is expected to fall by October.
Russia - a key political actor
With these developments Russia has already become a key political actor in regional developments. A Russia –Iran-Turkey Axis is being strengthened as a counterweight to the US influence in the area.
Already their cooperation covers several fields including economic, political and military. For example, Turkey’s trade with Russia increased by 28 percent during the first half of 2017.
According to Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan the volume of Turkey’s trade with Russia is expected to reach $ 100 billion by year end.
Recently oil companies in Russia, Iran and Turkey signed an agreement to jointly invest in oil and gas ventures. Turkey has also signed a deal with Russia to purchase S-400 Surface - To –Air (ZAM) missile defence systems amidst opposition from NATO.
