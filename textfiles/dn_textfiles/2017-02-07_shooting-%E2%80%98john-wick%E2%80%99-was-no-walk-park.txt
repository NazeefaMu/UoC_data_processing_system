Shooting ‘John Wick’ was no walk in the park

John Wick: Chapter 2 filmmaker Chad Stahelski knows both Keanu Reeves and Laurence Fishburne well; he worked as Reeves’ stunt double on the Matrix movies and directed the Speed star in the first John Wick film. But Stahelski admits that even he geeked out when the time came to shoot the scene in his hitman action sequel which reunites Reeves (a.k.a. the former Neo) with Fishburne (a.k.a. the onetime Morpheus).
“First day with Laurence, we’re shooting rooftop stuff,” says Stahelski. “Once Keanu comes out of the door, it’s Laurence’s shot [in which he says], ‘The Man, the myth, the legend, John Wick.’ We had been to Laurence’s apartment in New York. We had talked about the scene. Laurence and Keanu had workshopped it a little bit, so we got it pretty dialed in. Then you step on set, we’re doing this big crane move — ‘The man, the myth, the legend’ — and I’m geeking out over on the other side of the roof. It’s very personal to me, because I spent so much time with these guys, and when I met them, I was only, like, 26 and just a stunt guy. [Back then] you’re kind of in awe because they’re great actors, great performers, and just cool guys. They were the coolest guys to the stunt team — just how they treated their doubles and stuff. Complete class act. Cut to years later, you’re sitting there, and you’re ‘Action!’ ‘The man, the myth, the legend!’ Then there’s quiet. I just spaced out for a second. And Laurence turns his head toward where I was standing, and he says, ‘You gonna say, Cut?’ I’m like, ‘Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. Cut! Cut, cut, cut!’ I’m like, ‘Yeah, I just geeked out, man, I’m sorry. I’m 46, and I just geeked out over you guys, I’m sorry!’” The Hollywood Reporter
‘John Wick: Chapter 2’ will begin screening at from February 11 at Majestic Cineplex, Empire Arcade and other film halls. It is a CEL release
