SLASA officers to strike today

The Sri Lanka Administrative Service Association (SLASA) is to engage in a strike today (14), demanding the government for the special allowance.
A silent protest would also be held in front of the Ministry of Public Administration and Management today at 10 am.
SLASA Secretary Rohana de silva said that all Administrative officers would be on sick leave tomorrow, in order to pressure the government and added that further measures would be taken depending on the decision given by the Minister.
He said that a proposal on the special allowance for Administrative Officers approved by the Salaries and Cadre Commission and was presented to the Cabinet last week, but they had once again referred the matter to a Cabinet sub committee.
“This happened once before as well. In 2015, a proposal was presented to the Cabinet and they did the same. It has been 3 years and nothing had happened so far. We fear the same thing is going to happen again. This time we need a definite answer from the Minister,” he said.
De Silva further said that an Administrative officer is one highly respected and a higher official position in Sri Lanka and they should be given recognition.
President of the SLASA Prabath Chandrakeerthi said that they have been demanding for a special allowance for the past ten years.
In the meantime, De Silva added that they had no intention of causing inconvenience to the public and requested the public to refrain from visiting government institutions today.
He further said that they are expecting a favorable reply from the Minister.
“Now the minimum salary given to a SLAS officer is Rs 51,405 and we are very well aware that other officers, including Police officers in lower ranks receive a better salary than ours,” he said.
According to the SLASA Vice President Rs 35 Million is spent per month on allowances given to SLAS officers today and if the special allowances are also included, the government would have to spend another Rs 50 Million per month.
He said that currently there are nearly 2,462 SLAS officers in Sri Lanka and amongst them, 303 are heads of departments.
He said that heads of departments have to be given Rs 50,000 as special allowance and for others depending on their grades the allowance would differ.
