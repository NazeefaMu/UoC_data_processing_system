ComBank’s ‘e-Passbook’ wins Gold in Mumbai

One year after it was launched, Commercial Bank’s mobile app ‘e-Passbook’ has won an international award for design, creativity and innovation.
The app received the Gold for ‘Most Admired Customer Engaged Mobile App’ at the 6th Asia Pacific Customer Engagement Awards presented by the Asian Customer Engagement Forum (ACEF) in Mumbai, India, on April 29.
The evaluation for the ACEF award covered First impression; Home page pre-testing; Sub-page pre-testing; Navigation pre-testing; Task analysis; Execution Analysis and Final impression.
“We are delighted to win Gold in this very competitive category with a product that is relatively new, even though it has already become extremely popular with our customers,” Commercial Bank’s Managing Director and CEO Mr Jegan Durairatnam said. “We are constantly looking to push the boundaries of what is possible in our efforts to offer the ultimate in technology-enabled convenience to customers, and it is most encouraging to have these efforts recognised on the international stage.”
Commercial Bank was the first bank in Sri Lanka to offer customers an e-Passbook that provides real-time access to details of savings, current, NRFC and RFC accounts and credit cards on Android and iOS powered mobile devices.
This breakthrough digital mobile application offered free by the Bank enables account holders to view transactions of the past 30 days on their mobile phones or tabs anytime.
The app updates automatically whenever the user is online, and stores the last view of the e-Passbook on the user’s mobile device.The e-Passbook is able to display account history as in a standard Savings passbook or a Current Account statement.
It offers users real-time tracking of account transactions and can be used as a single repository for multiple accounts enrolled by an account holder for the facility, with the capability to view each account separately.
The award won by e-Passbook is the second ACEF award presented to Commercial Bank in the past two years.
In 2015, the Bank won the award for ‘Best Sustainability – Green Initiative’ at the ACEF awards for the effectiveness of the Bank’s initiatives to migrate customers from traditional banking channels to digital platforms such as mobile and online banking, as well as its investments in and efforts to promote automation to minimise the use of paper.
