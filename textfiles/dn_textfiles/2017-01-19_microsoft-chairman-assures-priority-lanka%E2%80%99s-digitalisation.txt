Microsoft Chairman assures priority to Lanka’s digitalisation

Microsoft Chairman Jean Philippe Courtois assured its support to develop Sri Lanka’s computer literacy and to speedify the digitalisation process in the future.
He expressed these views when he met Sri Lankan Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe on the sidelines of the Davos World Economic Forum in Switzerland.
While pointing out the importance of creating a paperless working environment, he said that Sri Lanka should take immediate measures to make this a reality.
Responding to Courtois sentiments, Telecommunication and Digital Infrastructure Minister Harin Fernando noted that an action plan has been formulated to this end.
The Prime Minister saidSri Lanka will open up to world’s four biggest markets in the future for its products and called on investors to identify projects to invest in Sri Lanka.
Development Strategies and International Trade Minister Malik Samarawickreme said 2017 is an important year for the country’s economic calendar where new projects will be formulated and put into action.
He called on the diaspora to further invest in Sri Lanka’s projects.
Up to 3,000 leaders from governments, business community and civil society have gathered for the 47th World Economic Forum that opened yesterday and will go on until the 20th in Davos-Klosters, Switzerland.
