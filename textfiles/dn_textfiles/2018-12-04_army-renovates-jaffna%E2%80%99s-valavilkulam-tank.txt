Army renovates Jaffna’s Valavilkulam tank

The Valavilkulam tank in Vadukkoddai, Jaffna was renovated by the Army and handed over to the farmers in the area in order to support their livelihoods.
The project to renovate the tank was initiated based on a request made by Dr. Sidambaran Mohan, the President of ‘Friends of Jaffna’ organization and the Farmers’ Society of Vadukkoddai - Southwest to the Commander Security Force - Jaffna, Major General Darshana Hettiarrachchi.
In response, the Commander Security Force - Jaffna provided the manpower and machinery to expand and renovate the tank and handed it over to the public. The tank was declared open on last Sunday by the Commander Security Force - Jaffna, Major General Darshana Hettiarrachchi and the Consul General of India in Jaffna S.Balachandran.
A large number of Army personnel and government officials also graced the event including civilians from the area.
The Vaddukodai, Valavilkulam tank which was renovated and handed over to the people, had in a dilapidated and unusable condition for a long period of time.
People could now utilise the water for their farming activities after the tank renovation. The farmers expressed sincere gratitude to the Army for this service as now they can cultivate the lands that had thus far been abandoned due to the lack of water.
