‘No interruption in power generation, distribution due to CEB strike’

Country’s power generation is 100 percent successful, while power distribution is carried out smoothly at 65 percent despite the strike carried out by the Ceylon Electricity Board Trade Union Alliance, Power and Energy Ministry Media Spokesman Pathum Pasqual told the Daily News.
According to Pasqual, during the last two days, CEB employees were reporting to work as usual. Pasqual said many retired CEB workers reported to work following the announcement made by the CEB asking for their service.
Pasqual said the Sri Lanka Army was not requested to provide their service as yet. “They would make an official request if the need arise,” he said..
Military Spokesman Major General Roshan Seneviratne yesterday said the Sri Lanka Army would deploy soldiers to assist CEB, provided that the Power and Renewable Energy Ministry makes an official request.
The CEB made a request from some employees of the CEB via its official Face Book page to stay away from using social media to “spread false information and insult CEB employees. “We like to bring your attention to clause (19) ‘Schedule A: Major Offences’ of the CEB Rules of Disciplinary procedure which says “Any act which brings CEB into disrepute or cause harm to CEB by use of social media, email services, web services or any other online interactive media” which as provisioned can be taken as a major offense,” the statement said.
