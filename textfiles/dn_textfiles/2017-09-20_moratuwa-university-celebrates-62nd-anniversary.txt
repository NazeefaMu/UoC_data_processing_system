Moratuwa University celebrates 62nd anniversary

The 62nd Anniversary of the Moratuwa University fell on September 13. It was a gift from the Canadian Government during the Premiership of late Sir John Kotelawala.
The Canadian Government initiated two projects during that period; a hospital and two technical colleges; one to Moratuwa and the other to the Dehiwala-Mount Lavinia electrorates.On September 13, 1955, the then Prime Minister Sir John Kotelawala laid the foundation stone for the college.
The new technical college later came to the fore and the courses commenced. The major course was Junior Technical Officers Course (Presently NDT).
Other courses included; Survey and Levelling, Draftsmanship, Telecommunication and Signallars, Building Construction, Geology, Preliminary Engineering Science, etc. A Registrar was appointed to look into the all aspects of the technical college.
In 1967, this was made an institute of practical technology when Dudly Senanayake was at the helm of the country. When Sirimavo Bandaranaike came into power in 1970, MP Wimalasiri de Mel made a request to the Premier to elevate this institute to a University. Some of the courses were taken out and the JTO was changed to National Diploma in Technology (NDT).
During the past 58 years, since commencing the academic studies as a technical college, its contribution towards the technical and engineering fields are immense. It has produced men and women of great calibre who have shone in all the fields that they represented, nationally and internationally.
