The winds of wind power

An uncontrollable global emission of carbon dioxide from fossil-fuel is the most dangerous environmental problem that the world is facing today. This serious threat leads to global warming, which has been increasing during the last few decades and, today, is at its highest rate. Therefore the world cannot anymore depend on fossil-fuel and we have to find renewable energy sources for our future energy consumption. Among all renewable energy sources, wind power has been rapidly growing as an alternative energy source and is expanding as a significant contributor to the world electricity grid, during last few decades. Denmark, which is popular as the windmill nation, has showed the world that the wind power has a huge potential to contribute to an eco-friendly green world. The world can learn very important lessons and experience from Denmark’s successful applications on wind energy.
Wind is not a new source of energy to mankind because we have been using it since ancient times. Wind mills are still popular in the agricultural sector, which have been used for pumping water, running irrigation systems and milling grains. The ancient Greeks used wind to sail ships and so called new world was discovered by the help of wind centred sailing ships centuries ago. According to historians, the first windmill was discovered in Persia, which had vertical axis, AD 947. Later in 12th century windmills were built in Europe on the Mediterranean coast and in northern France. European windmills had carried horizontal axis and it was a major technological shift. In the 13th century, windmills were growing popular in northern Europe, in France, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom as major power source. By the middle of the 19th century windmill growth had reached its peak. According to reports there were some 20,000 windmills in France, 18,000 in Germany, 9,000 in the Netherland, 8,000 in England, and 3,000 in Denmark. Besides Europe, China was a giant in windmill usage in the 19th century. According to French historians, there were more than 500,000 windmills in China and that number equaled to windmills, which installed throughout Europe that time.
Installing windmills
Interestingly, windmills were just not only an innovative power source but also a progressive social tool. British historian Edward Kealey argued that the windmill undermined feudal oppression and contributed to women’s liberation; “The windmill was a tool for social development, the number of skilled mechanics increased, and it lessened the burden of women, they no longer had to mill their grain by hand”. In addition, the windmill was a symbol of freedom, during feudal era. According to historian Edward J. Kealey’s research, windmills were behind various social uprisings and who initiated windmills in England, were progressive citizens.
The feudal land lords, who owned watermills, were totally against for installing windmills because there authority, commercial interests were threaten and some windmills were destroyed by these land lords, during that time. But social active citizens thought that wind was free commodity for everybody and fought hard to install windmills.
Besides Europe, the United States had a long history with the windmill technology. As the historian Walter Prescott Webb stated that farm windmill was one of the three technological innovations made settlement on the Great Plans. By 1850s, 14,000 windmills were installed in the United States and it generated 11 megawatts. Paul Gipe, author of “Wind Energy Comes of Age”, stated that windmills were rapidly popular through America, during next 80 years and in 1930s, number of existing windmills raised to 200,000 and total power generation jumped to 150 megawatts. During that time only 10% of farms were received electricity from Rural Electricity Administration. But within next few decades centre-station power generation rapidly increased and windmills installation significantly declined. In 1970s, existing windmills declined to 24,000 and total power generation dropped to 18 megawatts. Compare to US, Denmark took a difference approach on wind power in 1970s. Because of the oil import embargo during the Arab war, windmill nation largely concentrated on wind power development. At that time, 95% of Denmark’s power generation depended on imported oil. In 1975, Danish Academy of Technical Sciences determined that 10% of the nation’s electricity met by wind power. Denmark authorities started to achieve that goal and they have never looked back. According to World Wind Energy Report 2015, Denmark is the world’s largest wind energy generator. Their wind generated power share reached to 42.1% in 2015, increased from 33% in 2013, and 39% in 2014. In year 2012, Denmark government has set up another goal to reach by year 2020. Denmark authorities declared that they will generate half of the nation’s power from wind energy and to 84% in 2035. On the other hand the United States could succeed only 4.67% from wind energy.
Paul Gipe, who wrote of “Wind Energy Comes of Age”, pointed out that American wind turbines designed by aerospace industry experts, in contrast Denmark’s wind energy technology developed by agriculture sector. Denmark’s three-fourths of its total land area used for farming and country’s iron industry has closely linked to agriculture. They developed low cost wind energy technology, which directly related to agriculture sector. That’s why Denmark’s three-fourth of all wind turbines installed singly or in small clusters.
Denmark government introduced sound energy and public planning policy to develop wind energy, which led Denmark’s success on wind power generation. This policy has included financial incentives, local development dynamics and public administration and planning procedures. Since the local government reforms in 2007, wind power plant sections, planning procedures and other administration responsibilities met by the Denmark municipalities. This decision has led to cut administration red tapes and significant boost on wind energy production.
Incentives to local and foreign investors
Wind energy is becoming a popular trend. According to the World Wind Energy Report 2015, by the end of 2015, wind turbines contributed to generate 432.9 GW representing cumulative market growth of more than 17%. This represents 3.3% of the global electricity demand. Asia has become the focal point of the wind energy creation in year 2015, mainly thanks to China and India. According to the World Wind Energy Report 2015, total 175.8GW wind power capacity installed in Asia. The Chinese wind market almost doubled its capacity from 75 GW in 2012 to reach 145 GW by the end of 2015, reinforcing China’s lead in terms of cumulative installed wind power capacity. Since year 2006, India doubled its wind energy power generation.
Wind power accounts for 6% of India's total installed power capacity, and it generates 1.6% of the country's power. India’s new wind energy installations totaled 2,623 MW in 2015, for a total of 25,088 MW.
During the 2013 budget presentation, former President Mahinda Rajapaksa offered incentives to local and foreign investors, who are willing to invest in renewable energy sector. The Sri Lanka Sustainable Energy Authority (SLSEA) also has announced a policy to increase the share of renewable energy in power generation to 10 per cent in 2015. Unfortunately they couldn’t achieve the target. Sri Lankan energy authorities can learn lot from Denmark wind energy strategy, which mainly focus on small and single turbines.
