Chaos in Parliament
Speaker must be held responsible - Rambukwella

Parliament was chaotic because the Speaker did not follow the stipulated procedure to present a No Confidence Motion, Government Co-Media Spokesman Keheliya Rambukwella said.
He was addressing the Senkadagala Podu Jana Peramuna (PJP) Bala Mandala Meeting held at the Pushpadana Hall in Kandy recently.
He said Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa, responding to the request by the people, was back in active politics and in a few months, he impressed and draw people in their thousands to the new party.
The PJP is a leading political party in the country now since Prime Minister Rajapaksa leads it, Minister Rambukwella said.
He said Rajapaksa accepted the invitation of President Maithripala Sirisena to put a stop to the attempts made by former Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe to sell the country.
“The public marked the occasion of Mahinda Rajapaksa being appointed as the Prime Minister by having kiri bath in every town and village of the country,” Keheliya Rambukwella said.
“We faced the challenges by the UNP, TNA, JVP and other political parties effectively. We overcame Jayampathy Wickremerathne, Sumandhiran and the diaspora and we are ready to face the No Confidence Motion if it comes in the proper channels,” he said.
Minister Rambukwella said the Supreme Court will give the final verdict in December and the Speaker cannot act as he wish. “He has to follow the parliamentary norms and traditions,” Rambukwella said.
He said the Speakers entered the House under police protection since the way he was acting was wrong. “It is his action that brought about the chaos,” Rambukwella said.
