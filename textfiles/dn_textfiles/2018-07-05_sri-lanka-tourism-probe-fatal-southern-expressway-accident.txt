Sri Lanka Tourism to probe fatal Southern Expressway accident

Sri Lanka Tourism said that they will speak to Anantara Peace Haven Tangalle Resort regarding the accident where Australian woman Louise Collins, 37 and her daughter Poppy 4, were killed in a car crash close to Kurundugahahetepma access on Southern Expressway in a Hi Ace van.
The family from Brisbane, regular visitors to Sri Lanka was booked to stay at Anantara Peace Haven Tangalle Resort and was traveling from the Katunayaka airport to Tangalle at dawn after arriving from Australia.
An Australian woman and her daughter died from the accident while the father and son are receiving treatment along with driver of the van and parked truck driver.
“Police suspect that the driver of the van may have dozed off due to fatigue from travelling from Tangalle to airport and back without a rest and this accident has happened as a result. It has also been observed at investigations that the van had been travelling at a rapid pace, exceeding the limits and the tyres of the van too were worn out,” an official from Elpitiya Police said.
“Investigations are being conducted in connection with the issue of the truck changing tyres on the expressway without due permission. We are aware that the ill-fated van was not owned or operated by Anantara Hotel. However Sri Lanka Tourism is keen find out more details of the person or company which provided this van”, the Sri Lanka Tourism official said.
Asked to comment Anantara Peace Haven Tangalle Resort, Cluster Director of Public Relations, Norman Zweyer, said that the management and team members of Anantara in Sri Lanka were very saddened to learn of the road accident which happened on the Southern Expressway which tragically resulted in the death of two passengers in the vehicle.
“Ananta confirms that no team members or resort vehicles were involved in any traffic accidents that occurred during the last 14 days or in any vehicle arranged via the hotel. Our guest’s welfare is our priority and we have strict safety standards in place to ensure that this is maintained at all times.”
Asked specifically if the Louise Collins family paid for transport as part of the package for their hotel stay he said, “Anantara places great emphasis on the privacy of all guests and hence we are unable to comment or divulge information relating to any guests of our resort.”
