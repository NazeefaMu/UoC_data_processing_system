Gunaratne, Mathews return to side – Chandimal dropped
Lanka ODI players leave for India

Sri Lanka on Tuesday left out Test skipper Dinesh Chandimal from the one-day squad to face India on the day he completed a crucial century to help his side save face in the third Test.
All-rounder Asela Gunaratne and opening batsman Danushka Gunathilaka return to the side that has lost 21 one-day games this year and won just four.
Chandimal, who was last man out for 164 in Sri Lanka’s first innings in New Delhi on Tuesday, is the major victim of the latest changes made to rejuvenate national fortunes.
Sri Lanka Cricket last week named Thisara Perera as one-day captain in place of Upul Tharanga.
Under Tharanga, Sri Lanka suffered three consecutive ODI whitewashes this year against South Africa, India and Pakistan. Gunaratne returns to the side for the first time since being injured in July against India in Galle.
He will strengthen the batting order alongside former skipper Angelo Mathews who returns having missed the last ODI series against Pakistan through injury.
Sri Lanka and India play one day games between December 10 and 17 in Dharmasala, Mohali and Visakhapatnam. Six players of the team are already in India as part of the Test squad and the remaining nine players were expected to leave last night.
They had been stopped from leaving at the airport on Monday night as their names had not been approved by the Minister of Sport, which is a requirement under the current Sports Law for any national team representing the country.
Sri Lanka ODI squad:
Thisara Perera (capt), Upul Tharanga, Danushka Gunathilaka, Niroshan Dickwella, Sadeera Samarawickrama, Lahiru Thirimanne, Angelo Mathews, Asela Gunaratne, Chathuranga de Silva, Sachith Pathirana, Akila Dananjaya, Jeffrey Vandersay, Dushmantha Chameera, Suranga Lakmal, Nuwan Pradeep.
