A new frappe range from Barista

Barista’s latest initiative is the introduction of an all new frappe range. “Frappes have gained immense popularity around the world. It has become a trending beverage that many look for and being an iced drink, it is perfect for the extremely warm weather in Sri Lanka these days,” stated Barista, Training and Development Manager, Damith Dalawella in a press release. They now serve three frappes, the Espresso, Caramel and Mocha. The Espresso Frappe is perfect for the coffee fanatic as it is purely based on coffee with an added crunch. Caramel has always been a flavour that is much loved with coffee and the Mocha Frappe is ideal for those who need their dose of chocolate.
Barista, having first established in Colombo in the year 2002, now has twelve outlets and a growing number of coffeeholics patronising their finely brewed Italian coffee. Coupled with delicious food and friendly service, Barista has reached the peaks of the café scene of Sri Lanka for their innovativeness and new initiatives that keep their patrons coming back for more.
To serve all these and more, to the largest possible number, Barista has spread itself across the island in central and convenient locations in Colombo such as the National Museum outlet near Nelum Pokuna, Laksala outlet at Thummulla, at the World Trade Centre in the heart of the business district and in Bambalapitiya where most of the younger generation hangs out. Outside Colombo, Barista ensures their signature coffee and the best service can be enjoyed at key holiday destinations such as the Peradeniya Gardens in Kandy, at Galle Fort, Ella and Mirissa. The outstation outlets specifically attract many international visitors who look for a familiar brand during their travels. “Our skilled baristas are our biggest pride. What makes Barista stand out from other coffee shops is the culture that we create of a ‘home away from home,” said Dalawella about their passionate staff and the high quality service that they deliver. “Every barista is initially given full-fledged training of two weeks where they are taught of the different blends and coffee varieties.
This includes in-class and on the job training.” However, the training does not stop there. The new staff members are rostered together with a senior, called a ‘pal-trainer,’ for however long it takes, to observe and guide the junior until he or she has truly mastered the fine art of making the perfect cup of coffee.
