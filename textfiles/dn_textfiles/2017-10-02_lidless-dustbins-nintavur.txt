Lidless dustbins in Nintavur

The Nintavur Predeshiya Saba has recently placed concrete bins without lids in the Predeshiya Saba areas for the people to dump in garbage.
However, reckless people throw garbage outside the bins polluting the environment.
Cattle heads and stray dogs in search of food take the garbage out of the bins and scatter them along the roads.
The people urge authorities to place plastic bins with lids to remedy the situation.
