Sri Lankan held in Bengaluru is TN’s most-wanted bank card fraudster

Sri Lankan national Divyan alias Dinesh alias Pulikesi, 30, who landed in Bengaluru police custody on Friday, happens to be Tamil Nadu’s most-wanted bank card fraudster who had been on the run for five years.
The then TN governor had issued an exclusive detention order in 2012 to nab the foreign national, suspected to have swindled over Rs 100 crore.
Apparently, his blunder of revealing his original mobile phone number after purchasing a TV set using a cloned card brought Bengaluru cops to his doorstep in Jalahalli.
