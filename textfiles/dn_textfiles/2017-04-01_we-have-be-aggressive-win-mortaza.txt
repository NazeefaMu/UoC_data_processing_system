We have to be aggressive to win - Mortaza

Bangladesh are within a match away from creating history in another format of the game when they take on Sri Lanka in the third and final ODI at the SSC today.
Having won their maiden Test victory against Sri Lanka they are now eyeing a maiden ODI series win against the host. Bangladesh are one-up in the series and cannot lose the series – they can either draw or win it.
“If we can win the series it will of course feel very good. But for that we have to play very good cricket,” said Bangladesh captain Mashrafe Mortaza. “If you see the last match, they scored 300. Obviously the wicket was very good, but maybe we have to try to minimise 20-25 runs from that. Where they can score 300, we have to keep it to 280. So if we can do something like that the task will become easier for us. We have to play according to the plan, otherwise it will be difficult.
“Being relaxed is very important, because the team has won two matches on the trot be it Test or ODI. So being relaxed is very important and to play according to the plans put in place. I will always want that we play the aggressive game. It is very difficult to play with too much caution, because you cannot play your best that way. Either you will have to be in a defensive mode or you have to be attacking. And if you want to win a game of cricket, you can’t do it being defensive.” – [ST]
