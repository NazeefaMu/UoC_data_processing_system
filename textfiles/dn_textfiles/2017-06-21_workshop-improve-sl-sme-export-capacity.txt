Workshop to improve SL SME export capacity

International Trade Centre (ITC), a joint agency of the UN and the World Trade Organization (WTO), yesterday launched a three day technical assistance training workshop titled “EU-Sri Lanka Trade-Related Assistance: Increasing SMEs’ Trade Competitiveness in Regional and EU markets” at the Galle Face Hotel.
The workshop is part of an 8 million euro EU-funded project to improve Sri Lanka’s SME export capacity that will run until October 31, 2020.
“This venture will contribute to Sri Lanka’s inclusive trade-led growth and regional integration, which will in turn contribute to poverty alleviation. It will also increase the trade competitiveness of Sri Lankan SMEs,” ITC National Project Coordinator Dayaratna Silva said.
The ITC hopes that the project will help form a coherent trade strategy for increasing export competitiveness that will include policy and regulatory reforms and enhanced trade negotiations as shaped by the WTO.
Silva said the plan will lead to greater efficiency with regard to cross-border trade procedures that will facilitate exporting to SAARC countries and the EU.
The project will help boost SMEs’ competitiveness in export-oriented sectors such as food, spices, and information technology outsourcing (ITO) and business processing outsourcing (BPO).
