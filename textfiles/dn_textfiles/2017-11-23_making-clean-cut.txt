MAKING A CLEAN CUT

Cleanliness has become a buzzword today. Good personal hygiene is essential to promoting good health. Maintaining good personal hygiene, proper grooming and living in clean surroundings can help you ward off illnesses, feel good about yourself about life in general. Make these personal hygiene habits a part of your regular routine.
Washing your bath towels
Bath towels that are used once a day to dry off after a shower can be used up to three times before needing to be washed, assuming that you are hanging it somewhere dry so that it can air out. If there is odour coming from the towel it means that there are microbes growing. So it should be washed immediately. Wash bath towels separately from other clothing for sanitary reasons. Use detergent and vinegar to set colours using about half the recommended amount of detergent and half cup of white vinegar to wash water. The vinegar helps set colours and removes excess detergent residue.
Shower every other day or every day
Showering is all about hygiene. Since we live in tropical country and since the humidity is high, you need to shower twice a day. You can wash your hair every other day.
Using deodorants for underarms
Sweat is nearly odourless. The stench comes from bacteria that break down from one or two types of sweats on your skin. Deodorants contain some antibacterial power to stop the stink before it starts, while antiperspirants deal with sweat directly.
There can be many reasons for dark underarms like shaving and dead cells. Also, some people are just more prone to hyper-pigmentation from shaving, which can also cause the dark spots and marks to occur.
Cleaning your face
Wash your face with lukewarm water and a cream cleanser. Warm water helps lift the dirt out of your skin, but hot water can be too drying. Cream cleansers are more hydrating, but if you wear a lot of makeup, you might want to use a gel cleanser and/or a makeup remover instead. After washing, dab your face with a towel. Don’t rub. It will stretch your skin and lead to wrinkles.
Cleaning your ears
Your ears usually do a good job cleaning themselves and don’t need any extra care. To clean the ears, wash the external ear with a cloth, but do not insert anything into the ear canal. Clean your ears daily. Use ear swabs and clean the inner parts as well. Do not use water. Cleaning them every day will keep you away from ear infections. If it is not followed on a regular basis, you may have to deal with poor hearing problems as the dirt inside your ear will go on accumulating and hamper your hearing sense.
Sharing cosmetics
Sharingcosmetics, especially mascara, eye shadow and eyeliner, can lead to a bad eye infection. It is also bad to share lipstick as viruses can be spread.
You should never share anything that comes into direct contact with someone’s skin or mucus membranes. Also remember that the there are germs and bacteria growing in your make up brushes and applicators. So it is advisable not to share any make up as it can sometimes lead to the very unpleasant spreading of germs.
Get rid of feminine odour
Vaginal odour can be a signal that there might be a health issue at play. However you can control it by having, probiotics since they can help keep the gut healthy. However did you know that probiotics can do wonders for vaginal odour? Probiotic yogurt, for example, is rich in lactobacillus bacteria, which helps fight candida infection, a common cause of vaginal odour. It also helps restore the normal vaginal pH level, which can remove vaginal ordour.
Tea tree contains strong antifungal properties as well as being a great antiseptic. These characteristics help get rid of bacteria that may contribute to the problem of vaginal odour and discomfort.
I cannot stress enough the importance of water and lots of it. Fresh, organic, whole fruits and vegetables are always the key to a healthy body. Wear cotton underwear.
