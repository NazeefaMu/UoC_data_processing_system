Keeping the Peace

The United Nations (UN) was established way back in 1945 with the avowed aim of establishing peace around the world. This was easier said than done. Today, there are more than 60 conflicts around the world, apart from acts of terrorism like the suicide bombing in Manchester, UK. The conflict in Sri Lanka ended just eight years ago and the ones in Colombia, Ireland, Peru and Spain ended only recently. But the success stories are few – new conflicts have arisen to take their place, claiming thousands of lives.
A semblance of peace has been achieved in some conflict zones, but this peace needs to be enforced by an impartial party, lest the warring factions begin hostilities again. Who better than the UN for this unenviable task? In fact, peacekeeping is one of the biggest tasks of the UN today.
On May 29 in 1948, the first UN peacekeeping mission began operations in Palestine. Today, the world honours the UN’s “Blue Helmets” for their unwavering commitment to keeping the peace. The theme for the 2017 International Day of UN Peacekeepers which falls today is “Investing in Peace around the World.” Yes, peace is an investment for the future, because everything that is not possible with war becomes possible with peace. We in Sri Lanka know about this than anyone else.
Peacekeeping is an investment in global peace, security, and prosperity. It is a flagship enterprise of the UN that deploys more than 113,000 military, police and civilian personnel in 16 peacekeeping operations on four continents. Currently, UN peacekeeping operations receive contributions of military and police personnel from 124 Member States. This impressive number reflects strong global confidence in the value of UN peacekeeping. Their efforts on behalf of the international community are one of the most concrete expressions of the UN Charter’s determination ‘to save succeeding generations from the scourge of war’. Peacekeepers help bring peace and stability to war-torn societies around the world every day.
Sri Lankan soldiers too are involved in peacekeeping missions in Haiti. Even more than peacekeeping per se, it is a flexible, evolving instrument that brings together political, security and technical tools to assist countries make the difficult transition from conflict to peace.
Peacekeeping is a difficult job and occasionally, peacekeepers have to make the Supreme Sacrifice for peace in a strange land where they know no one and have no connections with. But peace somewhere is like having peace everywhere and they have not died in vain. Today, the UN Member States will honour more than 3,500 peacekeepers who have lost their lives serving under the UN flag since 1948, including 117 last year alone. They work amidst threats and grave risks - peacekeepers continue to come under attack from armed groups and terrorists, including incidents in Mali, the Central African Republic, and South Sudan.
Among the valiant UN peacekeeping personnel who received the Dag Hammarskjöld Medal for fallen UN Peacekeepers this year was Sri Lankan Army Warrant Officer ASP Pushpakumara of MINUSTAH (UN Stabilization Mission in Haiti) who was killed in January 2015. At the UN Headquarters in New York, the Secretary-General presided over a wreath-laying ceremony in honour of all peacekeepers who lost their lives while serving under the UN flag. Incidentally, MINUSTAH’s mandate will end in October this year, when a smaller successor peacekeeping mission focusing on the rule of law will begin.
Over time, peacekeeping has grown from simply monitoring ceasefires to protecting civilians, disarming ex-combatants, protecting human rights, promoting the rule of law, supporting free and fair elections, minimizing the risk of land-mines and much more. They have also strived to ensure that women are represented in peace processes, political life, and in branches of government including in uniformed services.
All of these efforts are fundamental investments in building lasting peace. Every mission aims to save lives, prevent mass atrocities, set the stage for peace and then close. In Côte d’Ivoire, the United Nations will complete the peacekeeping phase of its engagement with the country at the end of June after successfully assisting the country in restoring peace and stability following the post-2010 election crisis. The UNMIL peacekeeping mission in Liberia, which has made progress in restoring peace, security and stability in the country, will end in March 2018.
Here is a staggering fact: Despite the breadth of its operations, the UN global peacekeeping budget is less than one half of one percent of global military spending which exceeds US$ 1,700 billion annually. The world will be a much better place if countries can spend less on defence and more on peace. This is the biggest challenge that we face in a world driven apart by conflict and terrorism. The successful cessation of hostilities in several countries proves that peace is indeed possible of there is a commitment by the parties to the conflict. We should ultimately strive to create a world that no longer needs UN peacekeepers – this would be the biggest tribute that we can pay to the UN and its ideal of lasting world peace.
