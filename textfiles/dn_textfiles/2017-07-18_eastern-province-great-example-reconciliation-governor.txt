Eastern Province: great example of  reconciliation: Governor

The Sinhala, Tamil, and Muslim communities live amicably in the Eastern Province showing the rest of the country a great example of reconciliation, newly appointed Eastern Province Governor Rohitha Bogollagama said.
He was speaking at the inauguration ceremony of the Eastern Provincial Inter-School Athletic Championship-2017 festival (July 15,16,17,18,19) organised by the Provincial Department of Education at the Weber Stadium, Batticaloa on July 15.
He said sports activities help promote reconciliation, understanding and corporation among communities
Tamil, Sinhala and Muslim schools in the Trincomalee, Ampara and Batticaloa districts participate in the sports festival. Eastern Province Governor Rohitha Bogollagama inaugurated the festival as its Chief Guest.
He said the need for a 400 metre track for the Batticaloa district will soon be realised. He said he had visited several global sports events and the festival he witnessed here was not second to any of them.
“The youths in the province had suffered decades for no fault of their own. President Mathripala Sirisena has understood their situation very well. As his representative of the province, I will work towards better understanding, corporation and reconciliation among the three communities,” the governor said.
He said education provides equal opportunities for everyone. The province takes 9th place in the educational sphere of the country. “We shoud overcome this situation. By improving the education, we can provide employments and eradicate poverty in the province,” he said.
The Governor reminded the next Olympic games and said school talents in the Batticaloa district should be identified and providing a 400-metre track would immensely help in this regard.
He said the Eastern Province must create a name for itself by excelling in sports.
