Ragging, a psychological phenomenon!
Ragging has become the psychological disease, extremely difficult to get rid of, among the university students. Sadly, the students misinterpret and misuse the actual reason for the nativity of ragging. It was introduced because this would be a better opportunity for both juniors and seniors to mingle with and share their difficulties and happiness in a reciprocal way. Both the new students and the seniors should feel cheerful, familiar, and friendly thereafter.
In contrast, the senior students behave in an ugly manner, hurt and spoil the future of the new arrivals who experience psychological and physical harassment for the petty sadistic pleasure of the seniors, who want to show and experience domination, superiority complex, and over the moon in causing pain.
There have been records, during the four years of their studies, the victims did not mingle with those sadistic seniors and isolate themselves from them, causing batch as well as group or individual conflicts and clashes thereafter. Ironically, these offending seniors too hesitate and isolate themselves from the offended juniors even after the welcome party. Thereby the real purpose is lost behind this tradition of ‘ragging’ in the negative sense and ‘mingling’ in the positive sense.
As they are already suffering from home-sick, the raggers make the situation from bad to worse. The students are hurt by the filthy words and the corporal attacks which are very ordeal treatments.
The students come from different livelihoods, in which the father is the breadwinner who makes both ends meet. Sadly, after burning the midnight oil for years, they enter the university with lots of dreams to make them true amidst of huge challenges. They enter the university, with the hope of making a bright future and uplift their parents’ life too. Unfortunately, they are smashed with the shattered hopes.
Top of the inhuman acts, the boys are made naked and gender-based violence also takes place, especially at the hostels. Some unable to bear such mental agonies discontinue their studies and seek jobs to support their family. In the history of the incidents, there have been deaths and suicides taken place. These incidents were the harrowing experience for the new entrants.
The Authority of the Universities and the UGC, without turning into deaf ears, should intervene and take concrete remedy to facilitate the innocent students to complete their higher education with flying colours, without being dropped out. They ought to foot on the university without any fear.
No doubt, the learned people know that education is the only weapon to overcome all sort of difficulties and disparities in life.
At any cost or for any reason, learning right should not be suppressed or disturbed. Be that as it may, youth is a phase of the life and once it passed over those tomfooleries would be felt as follies, the late realization, even by the miscreants. With the vision of life, everyone should act and the vision without action is only a dream.
