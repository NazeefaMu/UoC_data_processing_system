Healthy dining and beverage options  at BASICO Bar Lounge
Seasonal Specialty Produce High Tea at  Hilton Residences

Hilton Colombo Residences launched its high tea with seasonal specialty produce at BASICO Bar Lounge in the month of July.
The objective of this initiative is to look at the health aspect of each seasonal produce and how it can be used in daily dishes. The high tea at BASICO will feature a range of specialty seasonal produce for both sweet and savoury variations which will be paired with a range of tea. The high tea will be made available every Thursday and Friday, from 4 – 6pm at BASICO.
Speaking of the seasonal specialty produce, Food and Beverage Manager at Hilton Colombo Residences Priyal Wijesuriya, said this promotion will help to connect with cultural relevance in South East Asia. “Mint and tea are ingredients that we use daily, but its uses and benefits are less known. This month we will introduce it in our dining experiences to emphasizes on its benefits to health with sweet and savoury offerings,” said Wijesuriya.
