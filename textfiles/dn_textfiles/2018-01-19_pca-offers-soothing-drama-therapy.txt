PCA offers soothing drama therapy

The Psychological Counsellors’ Association (PCA) is the alumni of the diploma holders of Psychological Counselling of the Institute of Human Resource Advancement (IHRA) which is under the University of Colombo.
Its advisers are two well-known personalities in the counselling and psychology field - Prasanna Kamalasiri Perera, a very popular and a qualified Psychological Counsellor and a Motivational Trainer much sought after by the corporate and the government sector, was the coordinator of the counselling diploma programme of the IHRA.
Dr. Niel Fernando, a much respected Psychiatrist, a Senior Lecturer and Head of Department of Psychology in the Faculty of Medicine of the Kotelawala Defence University (KDU) in Ratmalana, was formerly the Consultant Psychiatrist of National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) and a visiting lecturer at the IHRA who lectured the members in their particular study program.The energetic PCA membership is now involved in varied fields around the country from counseling to medical and health, service, education, training and human resource.
In its quest to uplift the knowledge and standard of the members and enhance their experience in counseling, the PCA headed by Founder President Damith Perera, regularly holds training workshops in Colombo and reaches out to the general public by accepting public counseling assignments. Since 2016, the PCA partners with ‘Future Minds – Higher Education and Career Exhibition’, an annual three-day educational event at the BMICH, by solely managing the career guidance counseling unit through its members. There the widely experienced PCA membership counsels treating more than 1,000 individuals on a daily basis.
In keeping with its Vision of ‘being active in order to create mental well-being to make people happy’, the members travel far and wide in the country to offer counseling in all forms –from first aid counseling to drug and alcohol counseling; marriage and family counseling, child and teenage counseling; educational and career guidance counseling, grief and trauma counseling etc. When a need arises, the association offers free counseling sessions in distant village schools and temples as a social service responsibility to the people of Sri Lanka. Counselling is done in many ways.
An interesting, fun and a stress-free way is through aesthetics using music, art and drama. Counsellors often use this non-verbal therapeutic technique to get through to many deeply grieved individuals to open up and get over their psychological issues.
This year as a fund raiser to expand the services offered by its membership to the community, the PCA will stage the well known and the award winning Sinhala stage drama “Nethuwa Beri Minihek” (A man much needed), produced by Raitha Dissanayake. He is an acclaimed leading playwright who has been in the field from the 90s to date producing many popular and award-winning plays such as ‘Weeraya Merila’, ‘Sihina Horu Aran’, ‘Apahu Herenna Be’, ‘Bakamoona Veedi Basi’ and ‘Adara Wasthuwa’.
The drama, winner of seven awards at the State Drama Festival 2017 tells a satirical story of Jayantha, a Sinhala businessman, in a dilemma after a change in the political stage and how that change affects him and his family.
The cast of ‘Nethuwa Beri Minihek’ comprises of Dharmapriya Dias, Shyam Fernando, Nadeeshan Peliarachchi, BimsaraPremaratne, Pasan Ranaweera, Anuradha Mallawarachchi, Nalin Lusena, Charindra Chandrasena and KasunChathuranga.
