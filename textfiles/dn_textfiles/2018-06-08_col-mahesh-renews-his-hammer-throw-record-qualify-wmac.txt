Col. Mahesh renews his hammer throw record to qualify for WMAC

The National Masters’ Athletic Championship was held at the Sugathadasa Stadium on June 2 and 3 as a selection trial for World Masters’ Athletic Championship (WMAC) which is to be held from September 2 to 16 in Spain. Colonel Mahesh Abeyratne representing SL Army contested in hammer throw and javelin throw.
Mahesh qualified for WMAC - 2018 with a new hammer throw meet record of 31.26m, erasing his own previous record of 30.08m which he had set up during last year’s meet under the age category, 50.
Mahesh is an old boy of St. Joseph Vaz Collage, Wennappuwa and excelled in the field of sports. This veteran sportsman was able to qualify for previous WMACs in 2014 (France) and 2016 (Australia).
The WMAC is a biannual event. Although he was selected for WMAC twice, he could not represent the country due to his busy schedule in the Army.
But Mahesh won the hammer throw silver medal in 20th Asian Masters’ Athletic Championship in China. Therefore, it is believed that Mahesh will be able to achieve a significant victory, especially in hammer throw in this year’s WMAC. At present he is serving in Vavuniya Army Camp.
