Can Sri Lanka finish among top three?

2017 Asian Rugby Sevens Series second leg in South Korea :
Sri Lankan Tuskers are ready for the high expectation that comes with their fighting nature where they will look to get the tournament second leg off to a winning start in the Asian Sevens series 2nd leg in Incheon Namdong Asiad Rugby Stadium in South Korea today.
In this second leg Sri Lankans are drawn in Pool “A” along with Japan, China and Chinese Taipei.
The players are going to have no excuses in terms of being able to come out and be comfortable where they are playing and their placing as they are bunch of professional rugby players. In reality that comes with added experience, expectation as well and a bit of pressure the players put on themselves.
There is plenty on the line for a Sri Lankan seven’s rugby outfit that has exuded a relaxed and focused vibe during training for the past two weeks at Racecourse International Stadium in Colombo.
It’s always a bonus that doing well will get you to this kind of top tournaments especially playing against the best like Japan, Hong Kong and South Korean teams in Asia.
Selection committee chairman of Sri Lanka Rugby Michael Jayasekara said, “We had an injury problem to our wing three quarter Buddhima Piyaratne, so we had to replace him with experience player Srinath Sooriyabandara in the last minute. We got a very young side that is really good, hence if we play to our potential, I am expecting them to finish at least among the top three in the tournament in South Korea as we are really capable of achieving this.”
On 23 September Sri Lanka will play Japan at 7.14 am (SL time), China at 10.32 am (SL time) and their final match for the day will be against Chinese Taipei at 1.28 pm (SL time).
The 12 member probable full squad of players who will represent each of the eight teams will be.
Sri Lanka - Sudarshana Muthuthanthri, Jason Dissanayake, Kevin Dixon, Omalka Gunaratne, Naveen Henakankanamage, Tarinda Ratwatte, Danushka Ranjan, Sudam Sooriyaarachchi, Danush Dayan, Chanaka Chandimal, Hirantha Perera, Srinath Sooriyabandara.
