Milo inter-schools ‘A’ Division knockout rugby: Underdogs Wesley face  formidable Royal

 
All roads will lead to the Royal Sports Complex this evening as rugby fans prepare for a bruising battle of attrition between two evenly matched schools the resurgent Wesley College and Royal who were placed third in the league in their Milo Inter- schools ‘A’ Division knockout rugby tournament quarterfinal match. Kick-off is at 4:30pm.
Both schools have proud histories of their rugby prowess and clashes between them have always provided fans with thrilling fare.
They have proved worthy quarterfinalist with a consistent display of quality rugby against all their opponents in the league tournament and appear to have peaked at just the right time to provide a grand finale to the ongoing schools rugby season.
The game will be a battle between Wesley’s speedy three quarters and Royals mobile forwards.
Wesley had a fairly lean first couple of matches compared to their own high standards but improved their game as the season progressed and despite ending in sixth place in the league have picked up their game with four wins over D.S. Senanayake, St. Joseph's, Dharmaraja Kandy and Kingswood Kandy but suffered a surprise loss to St. Anthony’s Kandy in their final league match in Kandy.
For Wesley last year’s skipper and full back Omar Kuthubdeen has been a tower of strength and has led from the front and emerged as one of the leading points scorers for them. Avishka Lee, Avantha Lee, Mursheed Doray and Avantha Hashan have bonded into a powerful unit.
Meanwhile high riding Royal also had emphatic wins in the league on their way to the knockout. They recorded victories over D.S.Senanayake, St. Peter’s, Trinity, Wesey, St. Anthony’s Kandy and Science whom they beat with ease last week. Hooker Azmir Fajudeen, Hisham Barrie, prop forward Ayesh Maduranga and their versatile skipper cum number eight Nikila Gunadeera will be the men to watch. Fajudeen is arguably the player of the season and the Wesley defence will have their work cut out to keep this talented player shackled.
Scrum half and vice-captain Ashok Wijeykumar is a bundle of energy and a good reader of the game. He is well supported in the back division by fly half Lenox Calyanaratne, centres Janindu Dilshan, Thulaib Hassan and wingers Mahima Gamage and Nikil George. Fullback Ovin Askey has been a revelation in his ability to join the line and his speed has brought him rich rewards.
Royal who have swept apart many competitive schools before them this season must be firm favourites but they know that they are up against a strong side and a loss to Wesley will not only prevent them achieving a top spot in this knockout championship but will also take away some of the gloss of their grand performances for the season. - (WAI)
