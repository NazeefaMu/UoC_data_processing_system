SLFP to contest  LG poll under  ‘Hand’ symbol

 
 Irrigation and Water Resources Management Minister Vijitha Wijayamuni Soysa said the SLFP will contest the Local Government elections under the Hand symbol, as it (Hand symbol) had been forgotten by many.
“The Hand symbol, the colour blue and the Bandaranaikes were the well known slogans we used when we established the party. The party has its own respect and a strong place  in the hearts of the people which can never be destroyed. This decision has been taken to maintain the standards of the party,”he said.
The observation was made yesterday at a press conference held at Irrigation Department.
Minister Soysa added that people will very soon understand the motives of the former President Mahinda Rajapaksa.
He condemned the behavior of the Joint Opposition referring to Pada Yatra protesters who hooted at the Sri Lanka Freedom Party headquarters.
“Even in a family there are children who do not respect their parents or the family. The behavior of those SLFPers who were disrespectful towards the party leader and the party headquarters is also something similar,”he said.
“The party was humiliated in the presence of many senior SLFP ministers yet no one did take notice of it. A majority of those in the Joint Opposition group are not people who can be identified as being from the SLFP, as they are people who destroyed their own parties,” he added.
He went on to note that SLFPers and the people of the country must understand the democracy that has been brought to the party under the leadership of Maithripala Sirisena and that must be protected.
Minister further said though the JO members were holding protest marches all around the country shouting slogans against the government, it was necessary to understand that they can never topple the government.
“Many members who speak against President Sirisena and the party, phone the President during the other day and tell him that the media had misquoted them,”he added.
He also assured that strict disciplinary action would be taken against party members for their bad behavior at the rally.
Asked whether he still wishes to work with Joint Opposition Members, Minister Soysa said that those people are still attached to the SLFP.
Referring to the usage of a small boy to speak against the government, Minister said it was a shameful act of the JO members.
“The National Child Protection Authority (NCPA) should take necessary action,” he added.
Responding to a question raised by a journalist about MPs Wimal Weerawansa and Udaya Gammapila, Minister Soysa said that he can never work with MP Weerawansa and added that Gammanpila is still a child in the field of politics.
