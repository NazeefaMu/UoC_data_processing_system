Certain estate companies violating collective agreement

Some Estate companies have been violating the collective agreement signed with estate sector trade unions and do not pay the increased wages for their employees, Labour and Trade Union Relations Ministry sources said.
According to sources, this was revealed during a recent discussion held at the ministry. According to the collective agreement signed between estate companies and trade unions, estate companies should pay a production allowance of Rs. 140, but they skip paying this allowance using various tactics.
The collective agreement stipulates that one estate worker receives a salary of Rs. 730 and the production allowance depends on the workload carried out by the worker.
The companies have increased the workload to a level that a worker was unable to complete in order to avoid paying Rs. 140, the sources said.
The companies rejected the accusation. Minister Seneviratne ordered a report to be submitted to him within a month after observing the behaviour of the accused companies, the sources added.
