Coffee helps people work better as a team

For many of us, the promise of coffee is the only thing that gets us out of bed.
A second cafetiere is needed before we talk to anyone in the office and a third cup just about keeps us civil towards our colleagues until lunchtime.
So it’s no surprise that coffee makes us work better in a team.
Researchers from Ohio State University conducted two experiments with groups of undergraduates and found that those who drank caffeinated coffee were able to stay more on task.
The first study looked at 72 coffee drinkers, half of whom were told to drink a cup of coffee and rate its flavour at the very beginning of the experiment and half who drank one at the end.
They were then split into smaller groups and were asked to discuss various controversial topics like social inequality for 15 minutes – after which they were asked to evaluate their performance in the conversation and that of their fellow students.
And researchers found that those who drank coffee beforehand rated themselves and their teammates more highly than those who didn’t.
The second study involved 61 students, all of whom drank a cup of coffee at the start but with half having decaf.
This time, those who drank the caffeinated drink rated their performance more positivity than those who drank decaf.
And that’s led the study’s authors to conclude that caffeinated coffee can boost participants’ alertness.
Those who drank caffeine also tended to stay more on topic than those who had decaf or no coffee at all.
Co-author Amit Singh says, “We suspect that when people are more alert they see themselves and the other group members contributing more, and that gives them a more positive attitude.”
