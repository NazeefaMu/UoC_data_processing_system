Govt. ready to accept Mahasangha’s solution to SAITM issue

Kiriella says GMOA should be flexible  
The Government is prepared to accept the solution to the SAITM problem proposed by the Mahasangha with due honour and it is hoped that the GMOA will be flexible enough to agree to the proposal to find a final solution, Higher Education and Highways Minister Lakshman Kiriella said.
Kiriella said the GMOA sticked to the position that SAITM should be abolished and it would be futile if it came in for discussions clinging on to the same position.
Both parties to a dispute should change extreme positions and come to a central point in order to resolve it.
Kiriella said framing education policy was the duty and responsibility of the government rather than doctors or undergraduates.
Since the GMOA and a minor group of university dons were trying to disrupt the education of university students by encouraging them to launch demonstrations, he would request university students to first attend lectures so their the problem could be solved through discussions.
