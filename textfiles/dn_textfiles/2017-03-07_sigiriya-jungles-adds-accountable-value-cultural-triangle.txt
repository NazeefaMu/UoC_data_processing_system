Sigiriya Jungles adds accountable value to cultural triangle

Sigiriya Jungles, a star class resort was unveiled at an investment of Rs. 880 million in the region of Audangawa in Sigiriya.
The new resort initially commenced operations in October 2016 after undergoing a construction phase of two and a half years. One of the main attributes of the resort is its central location being made accessible to the country's cultural triangle which comprises of Anuradhapura, Polonnaruwa, Sigiriya, Dambulla and Kandy.
The Sigiriya Jungles is made up of 60 luxurious chalets comprising of suites, deluxe and deluxe plus rooms that have been setup following a village concept that has been confined within a 10 acre plot of land.
To date, the occupancy rate has been favourable, having attracted over 60% of tourist activity and tourists have been reported to have hailed from countries such as the United Kingdom, France, Germany and China with an average stay of 2 to 3 nights. Sigiriya Jungles is part of the travel company JourneyScapes and is run by the company's Chairman, Devindre Senaratne. Senaratne also happens to be the President of the Sri Lanka Association of Inbound Tour Operators (SLAITO).
Commenting on the opening of Sigiriya Jungles to travel enthusiasts, Senaratne said, "My belief is that if one wants to experience the real taste of Sri Lanka, then booking a stay at a convenient location such as ours would no doubt add value to your holiday. Sigiriya Jungles is located at a point where you can easily access the cultural triangle and not have to worry about spending too much time going back and forth."
The hotel ground is predominantly spacious with the chalets strategically located giving guests a pleasing sense of privacy. Buggies are also allocated to transport guests with their luggage to their allocated rooms. A four foot levelled swimming pool on a higher ground adorns a major section of the landscaped garden area.
