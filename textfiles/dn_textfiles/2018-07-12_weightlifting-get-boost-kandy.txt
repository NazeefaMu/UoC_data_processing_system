Weightlifting to get a boost in Kandy

Weightlifting is to be given the best of support in Kandy in the future. At one time this sport was dominated in Kandy and produced several weight lifters who brought honor to their clubs, themselves and the country.
Kandy was the hub for the Iron sport. All this was made possible due to the immense support and helping hand extended by Kandy YMCA, who were backed by the National Olympic Committee and Sports Ministry.
Weightlifting was introduced to Sri Lanka as a sport in 1939 by an Englishman, who was a serviceman, named G.J. P. Hill at a trial contest at the Fort YMCA. This was followed by Kandy YMCA, but they soon went bankrupt in 1954.
Nine years later, in 1963, an organized and focussed association was formed in the name Sri Lanka Amateur Weight Lifting and Body Building Association.
This association, like in 1939, conducted a trial meet for amateurs in 1963 which was continued until 1974.
The same year, the bodybuilding section of the association broke away and formed the Sri Lanka Amateur Body Building Association, which was, since 1977, called the Sri Lanka Weightlifting Federation. The Sri Lanka Weightlifting Federation is a member of all its senior federations like the Asian, Commonwealth and the International Body Building Federations. Since the Federation was formed, it expanded its activities to the four corners of the country with the help of the Ministry of Sports.
Today weightlifting is catching up in a big way in schools. Even girls are interested in taking to this sport and be recognized. The Services have taken up the iron sport in a big way. From the first bronze medal, from the Pakistan International game in 1982 up to the present weightlifters have brought in many Silver and Bronze medals.
Our weightlifters have taken part from 1982 Asian Games and in 1984 Olympic game in addition to several International championships.
In 1986 we won a bronze medal at the Commonwealth Championships in Malta.
In the good old days, promoters such as S.A. Wijawickrema Snr and Jnr, A Dharmadasa, Maurice Windus, with a few others did their best to promote this sport. When the sport was declining and on the verge of heading towards a natural death, the above mentioned people came forward and brought the sport to its original status with great commitment and dedication.
There is another person one cannot forget he is T.S.J. Packeer Ally the doyen of Iron sport. When the iron sport was revived after 40 odd years, the first team to tour overseas (Peking), was G.V.A. Croos (Bantam), S.A. Wijawickrema Jnr. (Feather), Mahesh Sabaratnam (Light), Niyaz Majeed (Middle) and W.S.K. Perera (Light).
The team was managed by J. Ranasinghe, T.S.J. Pakeer Ally (Coach) who was a FIFA qualified Football Coach, Linne Schoorman went as referee.
