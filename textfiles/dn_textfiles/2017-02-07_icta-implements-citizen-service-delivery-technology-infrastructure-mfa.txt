ICTA implements citizen service delivery technology infrastructure for MFA

The Information and Communication Technology Agency (ICTA) took another step towards creating a digitally empowered nation by implementing an electronic Document Attesting System (eDAS) at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFA) yesterday.
Using this electronic system, citizens can obtain their certificates attested and certified within five to fifteen minutes, by accessing a single counter at the Ministry’s Consular division.
Till the launch of this electronic system, the MFA followed a manual process of document attestation and certification and citizens had to spend two days to obtain this service. However, as a result of the newly implemented technological infrastructure the issuing of certificates can now be done within 15 minutes.
The state of the art infrastructure includes high speed scanners and biometric authentication for ensuring document safety, traceability, good governance and transparency.

The center has been implemented with the modern queue management system which enables citizens to book appointments using their mobile phones and provides notifications on their mobiles as well. The solution was deployed on the Government Cloud infrastructure and connected using the government network. The system will also be extended to all foreign embassies.
“ICTA’s vision is to have a digitally inclusive society, and one of its objectives is to ensure an efficient and seamless, citizen friendly experience in government” ICTA MD and CEO Muhunthan Canagey said.
The Consular Division of the MFA serves around 500 citizens to attest and certifying their documents on a daily basis and they have to examine and verify more than 1200 to 1500 documents per day. With the implementation of this electronic system, the MFA can now provide this service in an efficient and effective manner where the general public spend less than fifteen minutes at just one single service desk. With the implementation of eDAS, citizens can also get prior appointments if they are intending to visit the Consular Division to obtain their services. It is also important to note that the MFA has managed to relocate the consular division at a new location with improved and developed ICT Infrastructure and interiors. It is a commendable fact that the service cost remains the same while the service mechanism and delivery is greatly enhanced and upgraded. Senior Director General,Consular Division of the MFA, M.Ganegamarachchi said the newly introduced eDcoument Attestation system in the Consular division would serve as a perfect example of how effective service delivery can be ensured through Cross Government coordination via digital platforms. “eDocument Attestation systems digitally linked to the Public, Sri Lankan and foreign diplomatic missions, Divisional Secretariats, the Department of the Registrar General, the Department of Immigration and Emigration, the Sri Lanka Bureau of Foreign Employment, and many others could benefit. The digital platform of the Consular division is capable of interacting with relevant stakeholders in real-time, drastically reducing the waiting time in the document attestation process.This enhanced credibility will also enable the public to receive consular services from foreign diplomatic missions and agencies promptly”.
ICTA has been entrusted with the task of digitizing the economy with vision of a digitally inclusive society. ICTA is the apex policy, facilitation and implementation agency of the government of Sri Lanka.
