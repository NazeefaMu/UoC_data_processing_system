Appeal Court order has no bearing on President - Premajayantha

The Court of Appeal interim order restraining the Cabinet of Ministers from holding their office has had no bearing on President Maithripala Sirisena and he will continue his duties unabated, based on legal advice, said Parliamentarian Susil Premajayantha.
Premajayantha was speaking at a press conference held at former President Mahinda Rajapaksa’s official residence in Colombo last evening.
The Parliamentarian answering a query raised by a journalist said that former President Mahinda Rajapaksa issued a statement in conformity with the opinion of the President.
“Arrangements are being made by a team of lawyers to file an appeal before the Supreme Court against the Interim order issued by the Court of Appeal restraining Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa and the Cabinet of Ministers from holding their office today.
He said that the discussion held between the President and the UNF Parliamentarians was scheduled earlier and the discussion was not arranged following the issue of the Court of Appeal order.
