Mandela’s walk

“I have fought against white domination, and I have fought against black domination. I have cherished the ideal of a democratic and free society in which all persons will live together in harmony and with equal opportunities. It is an ideal which I hope to live for and to see realized. But if it needs be, it is an ideal for which I am prepared to die,”
— Mandela's Rivonia Trial Speech, 1964
Nelson Mandela will be remembered for his struggle against the South African Apartheid government and his instrumental role in overthrowing it. While he was alive he was a living example that love conquers all. And in this death his message shall be forever. He was imprisoned for 27 years by the Apartheid Government for fighting for the rights of Black South Africans.
The United Nations designated July 18 as Nelson Mandela International Day in 2009 in order to recognize the values Nelson Mandela fought for. A concert was organized by the High Commission of South Africa and the Guitar Association of South Africa.
In his speech Charge d’ affaires, South African Commission, Johannes Van Niekerk spoke about Mandela’s impact upon history.
“Today for all South Africans, it is a day of celebration. This day is in recognition of our former president’s contribution to the culture of World Peace and Freedom. The General Assembly resolution recognizes Nelson Mandela’s values and dedication to the service of humanity, in the fields of conflict resolution, the promotion and protection of human rights, reconciliation, gender equality and the rights of children and other vulnerable groups. It acknowledges his contribution to the struggle for democracy and the promotion of a culture of peace throughout the world. This day, Mandela’s birthday is aimed at bringing people together to fight poverty and promote peace and reconciliation.
The marking of Mandela day is to serve as a global call for action, for people to recognize their individual power and to make an impact that can help change the world around them for the better. For 67 years Nelson Mandela devoted his life for serving humanity as a human rights lawyer as an international peace maker, and as a democratically elected president of a free South Africa,” said Niekerk
Niekerk said that Mandela Day is not meant to be a day or parties or celebrating but rather a day that we can devote to helping others. Perhaps those less fortunate.
“The South African High Commission in Colombo decided to partner with the Guitar Association of Sri Lanka, who expressed their willingness to compile a musical and cultural program symbolically designed to last for about 67 minutes to mark Nelson Mandela international day. Mandela once said: ‘Everyone can rise above their circumstances and achieve success as long as they are dedicated and passionate’, stated Niekerk
UN Resident Coordinator in Sri Lanka Una McCauley read a statement by the Secretary General of the United Nations
“Today gives me immense pleasure to say ‘Happy Birthday!’ to Nelson Mandela. Nelson Mandela has been a lawyer, a freedom fighter, a political prisoner, peacemaker and president. He has been a healer of nations and a mentor to a generation of leaders and people from all walks of life throughout the world. Nelson Mandela gave 67 years of his life to bring change to the people of South Africa.
Our gift to him must be to change our world for the better. Feed the hungry, care for your environment, volunteer at a hospital or a community center, be part of the Mandela movement and work to make the world a better place.
That is the best way to wish Nelson Mandela a happy birthday. It is the best way we can thank him for being such an inspiration to us all. Take action and inspire change. Make every day a Mandela Day,” said McCauley.
Secretary of the Sri Lanka Guitar Association, Mohammed Iqbal said that the Guitar Association is proud to partner this event on this special day
“Today we have gathered to commemorate Nelson Mandela International Day. This is to celebrate and to honor the lifetime service Nelson Mandela gave to humanity. July 18 was marked as Nelson Mandela International Day by a unanimous decision by the UN General Assembly. Nelson Mandela once said: ‘What counts in life is not the mere fact that we have lived.
It is what difference we have made to the lives of others that will determine the significance of the life we lead”. The Guitar Association wishes to spread the message of harmony through Sri Lanka, and is proud to be part of this global event.
All the artistes who will be performing here are performing voluntarily with no monetary gain. This is because of their respect for Nelson Mandela,”said Iqbal.
The performances of the evening, which were all very flamboyant, all paid tribute to Nelson Mandela in a splendid fashion. They were all very charismatic. There was a dance by the students of Dr. Subashini Pathmanathan that was aesthetically pleasing. It was very beautiful to watch the graceful dancers who commanded the attention of the audience by their dance. The outfits of the dancers were eye catching and very conspicuous. Their dancing had a lot of power in it and it was certainly entertaining. Such stage presence!
There was also a guitar performance led by Iqbal where Nelson Mandela was lauded by simple yet thought provoking lyrics accompanied by a catchy tune.
The evening on the whole was a memorable one with fine music and the dedication and commitment of the performers was pleasing to see. All in all it was evident that much effort had gone into the evening and all the items were well prepared and put together.
Much attention had been paid to the details and the performers all seemed really enthusiastic and showed a lot of panache. And I think the crowd appreciated the performances and appeared to be satisfied. The evening really picked up momentum and at the end it was hats off to the performers!
