Cuckoo Collector !

If you think it was annoying losing an hour’s sleep this morning, just spare a thought for this guy.
It takes brothers Roman and Maz Piekarski more than 12 hours to change the time on all 700 of their cuckoo clocks.
The pair have been collecting the clocks for four decades, and established Cuckooland, the world’s only cuckoo clock museum, in Cheshire.
All the clocks were made in Germany’s Black Forest, some are very rare and the oldest is more than 230 years old.
The brothers, who both trained as clockmakers in Manchester from the age of 15, are constantly fending off approaches from German enthusiasts to sell up but say they would rather die than retire.
Instead, they dream of finding a rich benefactor to house the collection when they’re gone.
Cuckooland’s main income comes from the repairs the two brothers can do, reports the i.
But as the popularity of cuckoo clocks dies out, Roman said he worries that the specialist skills they have learnt will die out.
He said: “I don’t know what will happen in 30 or 40 years when people want clocks repairing. There won’t be so many skilled repairers left. I’m disabled now, and have to do the Museum tours with a stick. But we’ll never retire.” Metro
