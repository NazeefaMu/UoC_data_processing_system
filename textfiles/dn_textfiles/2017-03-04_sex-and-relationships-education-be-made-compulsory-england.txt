Sex and relationships education to be made compulsory in England

The UK government on Thursday tabled amendments to the Children and Social Work Bill which will make it a requirement that all secondary schools in England teach relationships and sex education (RSE).
The amendments also permit the UK government to make regulations requiring personal, social, health and economic education (PSHE) to be taught in all schools in England - primary and secondary, maintained and academy - in future.
Relationships education, RSE, and PSHE are designed to ensure pupils are taught the knowledge and life skills they would need to stay safe and develop healthy and supportive relationships, particularly dealing with the challenges of growing up in an online world.
Currently only pupils attending local-authority run secondary schools - which represent around a third of secondary schools - are guaranteed to be offered current sex and relationships education, and PSHE is only mandatory at independent schools. Neither are currently required to be taught in academies.
The government is proposing the introduction of the new subject of ‘relationships education’ in primary school and renaming the secondary school subject ‘relationships and sex education’, to emphasise the central importance of healthy relationships. The focus in primary school will be on building healthy relationships and staying safe.
As children grow older, it is important that they start to develop their understanding of healthy adult relationships in more depth, with sex education delivered in that context.
The statutory guidance for RSE was introduced in 2000 and is becoming increasingly outdated.
It fails to address risks to children which have grown in prevalence in recent years, including online pornography, sexting and staying safe online. As a result now is the right time to address these issues.
