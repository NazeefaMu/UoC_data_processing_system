Special train service from Fort to Kandy

The Railways Department had taken steps to introduce a special train service from Colombo Fort to Kandy and vice versa, to accommodate additional passenger traffic at the end of the school holidays.
The said train would leave Fort at 7. 20 pm today and arrive in Kandy at 10.23 pm. It would then leave Kandy on April 22 at 5.25 pm and reach Colombo Fort at 8.40 pm.
