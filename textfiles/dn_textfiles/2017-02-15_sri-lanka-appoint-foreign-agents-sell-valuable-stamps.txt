Sri Lanka to appoint foreign agents to sell valuable stamps

 
Sri Lanka's Cabinet agreed today (15) to appoint foreign agents to sell valuable stamps to foreign stamp collectors in order to earn more foreign exchange.
Cabinet Spokesperson Health Minister Rajitha Senaratne said that in Sri Lanka, the sale of stamps and associated items for local and foreign stamp collectors was done by the Philatelic Bureau established in 1967.
"Sale of stamps to foreign stamp collectors helps in earning foreign exchange and in promoting the tourism industry through natural and archaeological aspects depicted in stamps," Minister Senaratne said.
