JO to support GMOA TU action

The Joint Opposition yesterday announced its support to the proposed joint trade union action launched by the GMOA on Friday over the South Asian Institute of Technology and Medicine (SAITM).
Addressing a press conference in Colombo MEP leader Dinesh Gunawardena said that the government is in the habit of postponing to announce its stance on the issue. He said that the government has failed to provide viable solution to this issue.
