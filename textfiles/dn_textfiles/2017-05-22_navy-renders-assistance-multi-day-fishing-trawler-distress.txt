Navy renders assistance to a multi-day fishing trawler in distress

Sri Lanka Navy rendered assistance to a multi-day fishing trawler, Thilak I, with 6 fishermen in distress, in the seas 72 Nm off Great Basses on Saturday (20). The trawler which had gone for fishing on May 7 from the Galle fisheries harbour had experienced an engine failure on May 17 and was adrift in the sea.
The SLN Offshore Patrol Vessel, SLNS Jayasagara was directed to assist the fishing trawler and fishermen in distress. Upon reaching the distressed trawler, the naval personnel looked into the basic needs such as food and drinking water, of the fishermen onboard.
The defective fishing trawler was towed ashore by SLNS Jayasagara and handed over to another multiday fishing trawler about 1 Nm off from the Hambantota Port to be flanked ashore.
