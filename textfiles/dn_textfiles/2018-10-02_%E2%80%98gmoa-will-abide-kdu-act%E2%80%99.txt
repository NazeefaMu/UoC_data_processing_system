‘GMOA will abide by KDU Act’

The Government Medical Officers’ Association (GMOA) will make sure it abides by the KDU Act, GMOA Secretary Dr. Haritha Aluthge said.
Addressing a press conference at the GMOA headquarters in Colombo yesterday, he said that the court order clearly says the Sri Lanka Medical Council (SLMC) should abide by the Act.
Therefore the GMOA will abide by the Act and make sure that the SLMC will do the same. The GMOA will take all possible action to make sure that the Act is being implemented, he said.
The Act was passed in Parliament with the support of all members. It protects the standards of medical education while ensuring justice for SAITM students, Dr. Aluthge said.
