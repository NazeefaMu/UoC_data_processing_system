Sri Lanka Tourism Promotion Bureau ventured into the world's most prestigious global travel event, International Luxury Travel Mart (ILTM), recently, in Cannes, France.
The main intention of participating at this luxury travel fair was to showcase upmarket tourism products of the destination to high potential travel trade buyers from around the world.
ILTM introduces global travel buyers to an unrivalled collection of international brands with a diversified portfolio of 60,000 pre-scheduled business meetings and product segments exceeding 30 different travel sectors with over 100 countries participating showcasing their international luxury product brands.
After a lapse of more than a decade, Sri Lanka participated at this prestigious travel show this year.
The Sri Lanka Pavilion at the ILTM was ceremoniously declared open with the lighting of the traditional oil lamp by travel trade representatives and Sarangi Thilakasena, Assistant Director, Sri Lanka Tourism Promotion Bureau, along with the ILTM show organizer for Europe & Asia, David Todd.
On behalf of Sri Lankan participants, Chandra Wickramasinghe of Theme Resorts and Spas said that it is a wise and timely move of Sri Lanka Tourism to take part at the ILTM travel fair which will contribute immensely to position Sri Lanka as a luxury travel destination among the highly recognized tourism portfolio of ILTM.
Sri Lanka Pavilion at ILTM Travel Fair was designed to reflect the prestige and the attractiveness of the destination with added touch of luxury across all elements of the stall.
During the ILTM travel fair, Sri Lanka Tourism was able to meet up with luxury travel media including leading travel magazines, journalists, online travel sites, luxury travel guide publishers and even high-tech mobile luxury travel application developers and bloggers.
