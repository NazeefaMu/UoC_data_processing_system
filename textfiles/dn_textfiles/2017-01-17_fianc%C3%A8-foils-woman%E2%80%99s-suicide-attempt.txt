Fiancè foils woman’s suicide attempt

A woman was rescued from a suicide attempt as she jumped off a boat she was riding with her fiance in the Kandy lake.The incident took place at noon yesterday.
The 22-year-old woman from Paragammana, Kegalle had come to Kandy  in the morning to speak to her fiance about another affair she was having.
After arriving at a solution, the woman had requested the fiance to take her on a boat ride on the Kandy Lake, to which the latter did not agree, saying he did not have money.
She had volunteered to pay the money for the boat ride and her fiance had to agree to the boat ride. While in the boat, the girl had asked the fiance if he was willing to commit suicide with her together by jumping into the lake, only to be refused. After the objection, the woman had jumped into the lake alone. The fiance and the boat operator rescued the woman who was wearing a life saving jacket. The 23-year-old fiance told the police that even while being rescued, the woman had not given up her suicide thought.
The woman was admitted to Kandy Hospital.
