Navy assists Kalmunai flood victims

Personnel of the Southeastern Naval Command reached out to assist flood victims in Thirawanthiyanmadu, Kalmunai, who were stranded following the heavy downpour during the last few days.
Due to heavy rains, the road leading to the village of Thirawanthiyanmadu had been inundated on November 9.
Under the directives of Southeastern Naval Area Commander Rear Admiral Ruwan Perera, relief teams attached to the Southeastern Naval Command were pressed into action and they transferred people from Kittanki to the Naval Deployment, Kalmunai, using dinghies.
