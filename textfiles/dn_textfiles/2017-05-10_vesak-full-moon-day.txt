On Vesak Full Moon Day

The birth of Siddhartha the royal prince To royal parents who eagerly awaited ever since Was an amazing experience Specially Buddhists, you and me Having been born in the sacred Lumbini Under the shade of a flowery Sal tree Honoured by the Devas, Brahmas and mother earth Put an end to the lengthy searching spree Bringing solace to you and me His luxury homely life enjoyed very high Was given up most willingly with no sigh Abandoning all acts leading to joy and fun Taking a glimpse of his new born son Paved the path for you and me He called for his rider Channa When taking the reins of Kanthaka doubling speed He heard a command “Siddhartha stop” To his dismay it was Mara indeed But defeated him creating bliss for you and me It was a stern “No”and then totally isolated Along Neranjana he slowly tread His search for the eternal truth commenced There under the Asatu Bo tree his victory pronounced For the victory of sansaric ills for you and me Enlightenment the greatest bliss dawned upon him Siddhartha Gauthama Buddha calm and serene Developing super human powers of divine vision Fulfilled the sacred task of his universal mission Bringing delight and safety to you and me
