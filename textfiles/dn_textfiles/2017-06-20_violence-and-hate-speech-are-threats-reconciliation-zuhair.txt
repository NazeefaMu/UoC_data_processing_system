Violence and hate speech are threats to reconciliation: Zuhair

With a debt burden of 83% of the GDP, this country cannot afford another ethnic or religious confrontation. Extremist violent attacks and hate speeches are serious threats to the on-going programme of national reconciliation and integration, said former Member of Parliament M.M. Zuhair.
He said this at the ‘Breaking-Fast-Ifthar’ gathering organized by the Medical Students Muslim Majlis of the Faculty of Medicine of the University of Colombo at the faculty auditorium at Kynsey Road on Saturday, where he was the chief guest. Medicine Faculty Dean Professor Jennifer Perera, Professor Rizvi Sheriff, Professor Shalini Sri Renganathan, Medical Faculty Senior Lecturer Dr. Ruvaiz Haniffa and Majlis President M.S.M Arshad presided.
Recent floods and landslides destroyed over 213 lives with tremendous damage to properties. Restoration of the damage is said to cost Rs. 9 billion and the government is compelled to seek foreign donations. Thirty two people were killed, earlier on, in the garbage dump tragedy. Extremist violent attacks on the minorities will strike at the root of the country’s unity and the peaceful co-existence of the people. It will cause irreparable damage to the economy against the background of the heavy burden of loan repayments, he added.
Zuhair urged Muslims to avoid isolation and establish closer cordial relations with other communities. "Sinhalese are tolerant and compassionate people influenced by Buddhism. A small minority is attempting to divide us into ethnic and religious factions. Sri Lanka is still paying the price for the July '83 riots which led to the diaspora confronting internationally, every Sri Lankan government that came to power since then. We cannot afford another disaster. It is important that we join hands as Sri Lankans and strengthen unity and good understanding," he said.
Dean of the Faculty of Medicine Professor Jennifer Perera said, none of the four major religions support conflicts. All the religions encourage good conduct and a disciplined society. Tolerance and understanding of differences strengthen national unity.
The Ifthar or breaking fast get together, attended by medical students belonging to all religions is a good example of ethnic and religious unity.
She commended the Muslim Majlis for organizing this fellowship.
Guest Speaker Ash-Sheikh Fazil Farook said fasting helps to medicate our hearts. There is an element within us that directs us towards the good and the bad. Good conduct is the key for peace and harmony. Fasting helps to discipline ourselves. Without discipline, we cannot progress as a nation.
Senior Lecturer of the Faculty Dr. Ruvaiz Haniffa explained the activities of the Majlis. He said the Majlis encourages extra-curricular services for the benefit of all the people.
Students get the opportunity of moving beyond their studies for public service, independent of ethnic or religious considerations. Majlis President M.S.M. Arshad and Secretary Fathima Saneeja also addressed the gathering.
