Moeen Ali withdraws from PSL for Mecca pilgrimage

Moeen Ali has opted out of participating in the second season of the Pakistan Super League and will instead join members of his family on a pilgrimage to Mecca. Moeen, who is currently in India with England's limited-overs squad, was named yesterday as a replacement for Carlos Brathwaite in the Quetta Gladiators squad.
He had been negotiating through his agent as to his exact availability when the clash of priorities became apparent. Quetta were quickly informed of his change of plans, and Moeen has now been replaced by the veteran Australian, Brad Hodge, who represented Peshawar Zalmi in last season's inaugural tournament.
"Moeen Ali is a top player and a great person, read a tweet from the franchise.
"We respect his decision to honour his family commitment first. Good Luck Moeen." Moeen, a devout Muslim, first performed ‘umrah’ in November 2009, and credited the ‘inspirational' experience for a flying start to his county season with Worcestershire the following year.
"I think I came back nice and fresh after that,' he said at the time. "It makes a person strong and it was a chance to just get away from cricket".
The second season of the PSL gets underway in the UAE on Feb 9, with the final scheduled to take place in Lahore on March 7.
