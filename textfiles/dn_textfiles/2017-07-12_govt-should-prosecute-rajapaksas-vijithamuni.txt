Govt should prosecute Rajapaksas: Vijithamuni

The government’s responsibility is to file cases against the allegations levelled against Rajapaksas as they can prove their innocence, Irrigation and Water Resources Management Minister Vijith Vijithamuni Soysa said.
He made this observation addressing the media at the Irrigation and Water Resources Management Ministry auditorium yesterday.
“If there are allegations against them, they should be investigated,” the minister said.
Minister Soysa said the SLFP is not of the view that the Constitution should be replaced with a new one, but it should be amended to solve the national issue.
“The government has no intention to change the clause that guarantees the position of Buddhism in the country,” Minister Soysa said.
The minister said the Uma Oya project that commenced during the previous regime is a failure as it has been decided to construct within a family cabinet. But the Government would not abandon the project since USD 500 million has been spent on the project, he said.
“Only the JVP needs to abandon the project,” the Minister said. He said those who were affected by the failure of the project would be given compensation.
Minister Soysa said no minister or deputy minister would join the Joint Opposition as they have joined the government voluntarily to take forward the policy of the good governance government.
“However, the government would not grant special privileges to keep the ministers or the deputies,” Minister Soysa said.
The minister said the Bill on Enforced Disappearances is important as the country does not need to see abductions.
