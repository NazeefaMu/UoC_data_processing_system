Sri Lanka have a fight on their hands to save Test

ABU DHABI, Sunday: A Test match that looked like drifting towards a draw was suddenly brought to life by two part-time Pakistani bowlers who picked up a wicket each to have Sri Lanka struggling at 69 for four wickets in their second innings – an overall lead of 66 with six wickets in hand and 90 overs of play left on the fifth and final day today.
Asad Shafiq (off-breaks) struck the first blow when he enticed Lahiru Thirimanne (7) into a forward stroke and the resulting edge was held by wicket-keeper Sarfraz Ahmed. Shafiq was brought into complete the unfinished over of Hasan Ali who had to leave the field due to cramps and the bowler obliged Pakistan with the wicket of the Lankan vice-captain.
Debutant Haris Sohail (left-arm spin) another part time bowler then had Kaushal Silva lbw for 25 playing an uncharacteristic sweep shot to a ball that would have gone on to hit middle and off.
These two quick wickets proved a setback for Sri Lanka who have a fight on their hands to save this Test after putting on a marathon batting effort in the first innings to score 419.
Everything depends on how long the Lankan batsmen can occupy the crease and the amount of runs they can put on the board that would safeguard them from defeat. At the wickets are Kusal Mendis on 16 and nightwatchman Suranga Lakmal on 2.
In fact Sri Lanka should not have lost a wicket as early as the 10th over in their second innings had not Dimuth Karunaratne suffered from a brain fade and walked off without reviewing a catch that never came off his bat.
Karunaratne was given out caught off bat-pad by short leg fielder Masood at 10 to a delivery from Yasir Shah in his first over. But replays showed that Karunaratne had not nicked the ball but only jammed his bat onto the ground. However to everyone’s surprise he decided to accept the umpire’s decision and walk off.
Manager Asanka Gurusinha said that Karunaratne heard two noises and that was why he decided to walk thinking that he had nicked the ball.
Yasir came back later in the day to strike a telling blow by having first innings top scorer Dinesh Chandimal caught at slip by Shafiq for seven to finish the day with figures of 2 for 25. He will be the danger man for Sri Lanka today especially on a wearing final day pitch.
The early dismissal of Azhar Ali for 85 as early as the 11th over of the day, enabled Sri Lanka to reduce Pakistan to 340-8, but then again the frailties of the Lankan bowling were exposed as they failed to clean up the tail.
Instead they allowed the tail to wag that saw the last two Pakistan wickets flourish to the tune of 82 runs before they were eventually dismissed for 422, a slender lead of three.
The batsman who frustrated the Lankan bowlers was debutant Haris Sohail who played a cultured innings of 76 off 161 balls (7 fours, 2 sixes) and was the last to be dismissed.
In the time he was at the wicket Sohail figured in a half-century partnership with Hasan Ali who made a useful 29 off 25 balls (3 sixes) and a further 32 runs for the last wicket with Mohammad Abbas (1 not out off 34 balls).
Rangana Herath not for the first time was the stand out bowler for Sri Lanka. The veteran left-arm spinner in the sunset years of his career took his 32nd five-for (5/93 off 40 overs) and moved to within six wickets of completing 400 Test wickets and five of reaching a century of wickets against Pakistan in Tests.
His current tally stands at 394 wickets from 84 Tests and he could either achieve it in the Pakistan second innings of this Test or in Sri Lanka’s first ever night Test which begins at Dubai on October 6.
Supporting Herath in the stifling heat were seamers Nuwan Pradeep and Suranga Lakmal who bowled with great heart to be rewarded with two wickets apiece for their efforts.
