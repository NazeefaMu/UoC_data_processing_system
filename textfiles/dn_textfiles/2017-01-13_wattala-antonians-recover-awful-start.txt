Wattala Antonians  recover from  awful start

St. Anthony’s College, Wattala playing sans three top players including their regular skipper did well to bat out two and half session on the first day in their under 19 division one tournament fixture which is being played at the Mahinda Rajapaksa International Cricket Stadium in Sooriyawewa.
The Anthonians electing to bat lost three wickets for nine runs in the first dozen overs of the day but a 71-run fifth wicket stand between Vishal Silva and Avishka Tharindu helped them reach a first innings score of 157 in 78.2 overs. Avishka scored 54 off 77 balls with nine boundaries while Vishal contributed 32 runs. Richmond’s opening bowlers Thilanga Udeeshana 4/39 (16.2 overs) and Dhanjaya Lakshan 3/11 (16 overs) were the major wicket takers.
Richmond were 43 for no loss at stumps on day one with skipper Chamikara Hewage (16 not out) and Dhananjaya Lakshan (24 not out) at the wicket.
A G A Chandana and Waruna de Silva officiated at the game. Play will resume at 9.40 am today.
