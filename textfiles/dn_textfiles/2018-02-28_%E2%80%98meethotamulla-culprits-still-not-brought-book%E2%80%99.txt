‘Meethotamulla culprits still not brought to book’

No legal action has been taken against the culprits responsible for the Meethotamulla garbage dump collapse as of yet, Megapolis and Western Development Minister Patali Champaka Ranawaka said yesterday.
The minister was addressing an event organised by the Sri Lanka Land Reclamation and Development Corporation (SLLRDC) at the Nelum Pokuna Theater, yesterday. Minister Ranawaka also said that this unfortunate delay occurs in a background where the Presidential Commission of Inquiry investigating into the Meethotamulla disaster had already handed over its report. He added that the report includes recommendations against five government institutions and persons who were directly responsible for the lives claimed at the collapse. Minister Ranawaka added that such a delay in justice shows the government in a bad light.
He further said the core values of good governance is lost if the government cannot bring the culprits of the Meethotamulla disaster to book. Minister Ranawaka said such a delay is a more serious wrongdoing than dumping garbage and that it is an insult to the victims of that man-made disaster. Minister Ranawaka said the main development challenge in the country was water management and added that one part of the country suffers from drought, while the other part suffers from floods. Thus, he said there needs to be a project that would manage excess water and carry it to drought-stricken areas. He added that a basic strategic plan to manage floods is being drafted at present.
