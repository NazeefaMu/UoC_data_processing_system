Gene technology to be introduced soon to treat cancer

 
Arrangements have been made to offer gene technology based treatment for cancer patients in Sri Lanka under the direction of Health Minister Rajitha Senaratne.
He has ordered health authorities to produce a report on this matter within two weeks, Health Ministry sources said.
According to the sources, there are 11 doctors in Sri Lanka at the moment who have the required knowledge and training on this latest treatment method.
Two of those doctors are abroad at the moment.
Others have held a discussion with Minister Senaratne and have offered their fullest cooperation to introduce the technology in Sri Lanka.
The main objective of the discussion was to set up a separate unit for the treatment. 
Minister Senaratne said that gene therapy cancer treatment named Keytruda was produced in the US.
The treatment is given to the gene which produces the cancer.
Sri Lankan doctors will be given training in three foreign universities named Breral, Rice and Houston.  
Cancer has become the second Non Communicable Disease (NCD) that kills people and it will become number one soon.  Cancer patients can be cured using gene technology and the US is doing it at the moment, the Minister said.
