Southern journalists update members on interim report

The Southern Province Professional Journalists Union (SPPJU) took steps to update its membership on what the interim report contains.
“It is important that we as journalists are knowledgeable to some extent on what the interim report released by the steering committee actually contains before publishing opinions rendered by persons who have not even read the whole document. With so many journalists competing to be the first to submit the news to their respective institutions, they hardly check the accuracy of what has been said,” SPPJU President Rahul Samantha Hettiarachchi said, explaining the need of the forum.
At the end of the half day discussion, it was the view of Southern Journalists that;
If there is any reform to the constitution that needs to be approved by the people at a national referendum, the people should be allowed to vote for or against each proposal separately.
The Sinhala term ‘Ekiya Rajjya’ should be used in Tamil and English as well, for at present, there is much debate if the correct word is being used in the English and Tamil translations.
