Battle of Lyceumers on February 17

The Battle of Lyceumers 2018 , the 3rd annual limited over cricket encounter between Lyceum International School, Nugegoda and Lyceum International School,Panadura for Nikitha Grero Challenge Trophy, hosted by Lyceum International School Panadura this year, will be held on February 17 at P. Saravanamuttu Stadium, Colombo.
This big match was initiated by Director of Lyceum International School Nikitha Grero in 2016 to ensure that Lyceumers too get the experience of a big match. This year Lyceum Nugegoda team will be led by versatile Pasindu rajapaksa under the guidance of Head coach Lal Senaratne and MIC Pathum Madhushanka while the Panadura team will be spearheaded by the team captain Sithira Tennekoon under the supervision of Head Coach Kapila Mahinda and MIC Rumesh Wickramasinghe.
Lyceum Nugegoda team won last year’s encounter by scoring 288 in 50 overs. Lyceum Panadura was able to collect only 139 in 45 overs for nine wickets. Nikitha Grero, Director of Lyceum International Schools stated, “We have come to that special time of the year where Lyceum Nugegoda and Lyceum Panadura will meet once again,during a friendly game of Cricket at Lyceum’s Annual Big Match.
Cricket is a wonderful sport and a national game that many of our players support and dream to be a part of some day. I still remember how enthusiastic we all were once Cricket was introduced to this school. If not for the foundation that was set by our pioneer cricket coaches, the standard of cricket at Lyceum would not be where it is today. Our cricket teams have continued to shine and perform exceptionally well in many inter-international and/national school cricket tournaments and therefore, this event would provide a great platform for both teams to display their cricketing skills.
The Nikitha Grero Challenge Trophy cricket encounter will be mainly sponsored by CeylonAgro, Industries Prima Group. Next Click Studio, NCG Express (Pvt) Ltd, NCGAutomotive are the Co-Sponsors. Sri Lanka’s newest job search portalJobAds.lk has joined hands as the special sponsor of the event.
