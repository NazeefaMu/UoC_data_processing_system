Finagle pioneers frozen dough products export with first consignment to USA

Finagle, the country’s leading bread and allied products manufacturing company, shipped its first export of frozen bakery products to the USA.
The consignment consisted of a range of innovative products including roast paan, thati paan, Chinese rolls, vegetable roti, kottu roti, roti paratha, godamba roti, malu paan, seeni sambol buns, pol roti along with chocolate and Swiss rolls, all with a typical Sri Lankan flavor to serve the considerably large Sri Lankan as well as Indian community in the USA.
Finagle took this pioneering step with a focus on supplying a host of value-added products to meet the growing expectations of consumers.
Finagle is also currently exploring opportunities in Canada, Australia and Europe and has plans to expand its range through the development of baked products that suit other communities.
Finagle Lanka’s Managing Director Mahinda Ranasinghe said, “This is our pioneering effort in venturing out into exporting our innovative products by the container load. We are taking this opportunity to promote a variety of products that are popular with Sri Lankans all over the world. These products have gone through stringent quality and hygienic testing as well as qualitative testing done by chefs and focus groups to verify standards.
He added that they have also explored other international buyers, who have expressed a keen interest in their products and will negotiate further for finalization.
Finagle Lanka commenced exporting frozen baked products to the Maldives several years ago. Although there are a few bakers who currently export to markets in developed countries, they are only in small quantities.
Finagle however is now exporting its own frozen baked products to the USA by the container load.
Finagle was selected as the baker of choice due to the consistent high quality of its products. The current shipment is for Los Angeles buyer Prince International, who will in turn distribute the consignment to 22 states in the USA.
Since all products are frozen, all that is required is to defrost and reheat any one or several of the diverse products, to enjoy a typical Sri Lankan meal or snack which is guaranteed to provide enjoyment and satisfy the palate of the Sri Lankan and Asian consumers and give other communities a taste of our cuisine. Finagle Lanka has obtained ISO and HACCP certifications, and can therefore be confident that all products meet the highest standards of quality and hygiene. No other Sri Lankan bakery has the ability, or capacity, to freeze baked or par-baked products for export.
Finagle serves a host of hotels and allied food outlets throughout the country as well with its range of products.
