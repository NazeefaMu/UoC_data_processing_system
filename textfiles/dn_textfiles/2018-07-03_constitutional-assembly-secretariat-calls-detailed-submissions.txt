Difficulties faced in public services
Constitutional Assembly Secretariat calls for detailed submissions

The Constitutional Assembly Secretariat, in a fresh attempt to engage with the public on the proposed constitutional amendments, had called for submissions of personal experiences on difficulties they faced as citizens.
The Secretariat, issuing a brief statement yesterday, invited the public to share their “true personal experiences on difficulties faced in dealing with public services, having their needs met as a citizen, encounters with law enforcement authorities and any such experiences.”
“The Constitutional Assembly Secretariat is engaged in examining existing recommendations in the Constitutional reforms in the context of the real needs of the people. We will upload selected stories together with possible solutions found in existing recommendations for reforms by the Committees of the Constitutional Assembly. Please check blog.constitutionalassembly.lk in due course for published stories,” the Secretariat posted in its official website.
The stories must be restricted to 500 words and emailed to [email protected]. Submissions could be sent in Sinhala, Tamil or English.
