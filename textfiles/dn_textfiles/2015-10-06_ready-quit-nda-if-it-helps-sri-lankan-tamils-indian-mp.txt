Ready to quit NDA if it helps Sri Lankan Tamils - Indian MP

PMK MP Anbumani Ramadoss on Monday said he was ready to quit the BJP-led NDA alliance if his decision could help find a permanent solution to the problems of the Sri Lankan Tamils.
Reacting to TNCC president E.V.K.S. Elangovan who asked why he was continuing in the NDA when India supported the “diluted” resolution in the United Nations Human Rights Council (UNHRC) for a probe into the war crimes, Mr Anbumani said the Congress leader was only diverting the issue.
“If it helps the Sri Lankan Tamils, I am ready to leave the NDA. India’s stand shocked me and I have returned a disappointed man,” said Mr. Anbumani, who attended the UNHRC meeting in Geneva a few days ago.
He said even though the UNHRC Commissioner’s report had not used the word “genocide” to describe the crime against Tamils in Sri Lanka, there was adequate evidence that pointed to genocide.
“An international inquiry will bring out the truth because the report had described the killing of Tamils as a system crime,” he said.
Mr. Anbumani said even now it was not late for Chief Minister Jayalalithaa to hold an all party meeting to prevail upon Prime Minister Narendra Modi to put pressure on the international community to get justice for the Sri Lankan Tamils.
