Customs bribery case fixed for June 22

The Colombo High Court yesterday fixed for June 22, a case filed against four former senior Customs officials in connection with the largest ever recorded bribe nabbed by the Bribery Commission.
The Director General of the Commission to Investigate Allegations of Bribery or Corruption filed indictments against Assistant Superintendent Upali Gunaratne Perera and Superintendents Wasantha Wimalaweera, Upali Wickremasinghe and Sudeera Jinadasa for their alleged involvement in accepting a bribe of Rs.125 million to release a consignment of spare parts worth Rs.1,500 million, imported to be used by the SLTB, by evading duty.
When the case came up before High Court Judge Shashi Mahendran, the defence party was given permission to access computerized evidence.
The Bribery Commission filed indictments against the accused on 14 counts.
The prosecution further alleged that the four accused had committed these offences on or around June 26, 2015 under section 11 of the Commission to Investigate Allegations of Bribery or Corruption Act No. 19 of 1994. Additional Solicitor General Ayesha Jinasena appeared for the Bribery Commission.
