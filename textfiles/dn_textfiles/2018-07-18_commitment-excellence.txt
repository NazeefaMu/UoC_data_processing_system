From  commitment  to excellence

Head Girl of Anula Vidyalaya Nugegoda Oshadini Piumika firmly believes that our actions have great power if we work together. Perfect Prefects features Piumika who feels it is never too late to make a change.
We need to be there for each other. We need to get off our high horse sometimes.
“Commitment is so important in life. Living in a world full of troubles and difficulties, if we think of another’s welfare while also thinking of ours, and if we can support each other, keeping in mind to do what is right all the time, then we can as young people influence our generation and the generations to come. It is so important to actually listen to each other and put our ego aside. Other people have something to bring to the table. They also have a point. They also have a perspective on the matter. Take a moment to be patient and listen to other’s ideas. When facing a problem I examine all aspects of the problem and then take a decision as what to do,” said Piumika.
Always change
Integrity is important in life. Your reputation matters. People can always change.
“I am the leader of my younger sisters at Anula Vidyalaya. It is important to be helpful and well- mannered and not rude and obstinate because rudeness does not help at all. Being helpful goes a long way because what goes around comes around. Trust is so important if you get into the habit of lying and if you go back on your word or if you are dishonest, you are going to lose a lot of potential friends and supporters,” stated Piumika.
If you take any statesman of distinction, manners and politeness are words that immediately come to mind. They are men and women who have rubbed shoulders with some of the most well-regarded individuals in history.
“Being courteous and obliging to all is the hallmark of a good leader. Being well disciplined shows that you have self- control. Respecting those who are more experienced than you does you a lot of good since that benefits you,” explained Piumika.
‘United we stand, divided we fall’. We are all familiar with this adage. But how many of us put this into practice?
“Poverty is, without doubt, an extremely serious problem. Starvation is painful. These problems cannot be solved by a leader no matter how brilliant he or she is. Like I said before a commitment is important. We need to unite as a group of people. We need to be loyal to our community. We need to create a ripple effect here,” pointed out Piumika.
Bad habits
Procrastination is the undoing of many of our fellow human beings. Once it gets into a habit, it can be a silent killer.
“Procrastination is a factor when handling pressure. If you delay working, you have to face the penalty. You can make your life a lot easier if you do your work on time without putting it off. The more you delay the more you put yourself under pressure. You need to have a positive mindset. That will help you overcome your procrastination. Do things on time,” explained Piumika.
One of the first lessons anyone should be taught in life is that if you feel good about yourself then others feel good around you.
“Enthusiasm is so important because it is infectious. If you are enthusiastic about what you are doing, then others around you also feel good about themselves and they feel good about you. Being positive is also important because no one is on the side of someone disgruntled,” added Piumika.
What comes first
Family always should come first. They have a duty towards you and you have a duty towards them.
“Family time is important to me. The little things I do with my family are so important, and though I attach a lot of importance to my duties, I always help my mother with gardening and share memories with my sister. These leisure activities make me happy. Doing my advanced levels in the bio- stream, I take an avid interest in science. Being curious and inquisitive I always keep myself updated on scientific discoveries,” said Piumika.
Piumika has a solid foundation in life. And she is who she is because of her parents and school.
“My parents and my Principal will always be my greatest teachers and leaders. My father was in the Navy and knows how to handle a platoon. My mother is a housewife but is strong-willed and can run the house. The both of them have taught me what true love is. My principal is an extremely versatile and remarkable lady. Her advice is spot on and has helped me a lot,” stated Piumika.
Piumika also added that being appointed Head Prefect was an unbelievable day and one that she will never forget. That was an unforgettable day.
