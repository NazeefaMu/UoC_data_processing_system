Has the Sports Minister been upstaged and hoodwinked?

A few days ago, there were unconfirmed reports that the Minister of Sports had instructed Sri Lanka Cricket (SLC) to replace the national selection committee. It was also reported that the Minister had wanted Angelo Mathew’s place restored following his removal from the captaincy that he deemed unfair and rightfully so. Amidst all this drama being played out behind the screen, there was a press conference held at SLC attended by the captain elect, head coach, and the entire selection committee.
The general temperament witnessed from the head table no doubt reminded the media personnel of a bygone era where questions disliked by the people calling for the press briefing was arrogantly browbeaten into silence and submission. These gentlemen needs to be reminded that times have changed, and media policy indoctrinated by the present leadership headed by His Excellency the President, the Prime Minister and the government is quite different, and today there is freedom for transparency and an environment to pose questions that are of national interest and general public wellbeing. So, any official holding a position of national office is obligated to respond to any question/s posed by the media in the public interest. For any unknown reason an official is unable to respond to any question/s such officials should not be calling for, nor attending press conferences.
At first glance all appear quite normal in spite of the jittery setting. However, what started to raise a few eye brows once the press conference commenced were; a) The Competent Authority wasn’t in attendance to chair the press conference as is usually the case nor was the CEO or the COO. b) The entire selection committee was in attendance perhaps for the first time in the history of SLC. c) There was complete break from protocol where the chairman, selectors read out the squads for the upcoming ODI and Test series against England. The normal practice is for the team to be announced by way of a press statement upon being approved by the Minister of Sports, and released simultaneously to all media and relevant institutions. Anyhow, announcing teams at press conferences was a recent phenomenon introduced by the Sumathipala administration to bask in cheap media exposure. The chairman, selectors should know better that the selection of national teams needs to be done behind closed doors and not in a public forum like reality shows that have become very popular in this country. It was in extremely bad taste to publicize the finer details related to their decisions where individual players are concerned as it destroys trust that is a key criteria in building teamwork among players and administrators.
The chairman should take a leaf out of previous selections committees who never even appeared at press conferences despite the achievements they accomplished. A good example is how the average cricket fan in other countries does not even know who sits on their respective selection committees as they carry out their sacred duties with utmost discretion protecting the integrity and transparency of this extremely sensitive process. Perhaps, the current chairman does not know the protocols that needs to be upheld and adhered to as he has never served on a selection committee prior to been installed as chairman by the Sumathipala administration.
What prompted this break from protocol? Were the two squads announced by the chairman, selectors have sanction from the Minister as dictated by law? Was the ODI and Test squads picked simultaneously to hoodwink the Minister by including Angelo Mathews in Tests whilst leaving him out from the ODI’s? The 3-match Test series starts only in November. What may be the haste to announce it now? What raises further suspicion over the real motive is the squad for the one off T20 game that is right after the 5 ODI’s not announced? Under normal circumstances, the squad for the ODI series would have been picked first. It is understandable if the squad for the one off T20 was announced concurrently. But, announcing the Test squad prior to the T20 squad does raise some serious doubts.
The question that begs to be answered is if there is a sinister cats paw lurking in the background?
Was this press conference held at the behest of such elements? Are there attempts to upstage the Minster and make him uncomfortable with executive immunity to checkmate his moves to take corrective action in order to safeguard interests of a few individuals striving to creep back into SLC by hook or by crook?
Such moves being afoot was further demonstrated by what was disclosed at another press conference that was conducted concurrently. This was by none other than the former Minister of Sports who made several allegations against a former captain, chairman and a cabinet minister. What was unwittingly confessed during the press briefing was his knowledge of Sumathipala having connections to the gaming industry. That being the case what the former needs to explain to the general public is his rationale for permitting such an individual to contest SLC elections in violation of the country’s Sports Law and rules of the ICC. What the former Minister needs to be reminded is that two wrongs does not make one right. It was further disclosed by the chairman selectors that he was carrying out match referring duties with the express approval of the former Minister of Sports and that double hatting did not interfere with his selection duties. How a member of a national selection committee can carry out selection duties and identifying young talent whilst being overseas for long lengths of time is mindboggling. It was such distressing decision making by people in authority that has created the untenable crisis SLC is grappling with at present.
Another major piece of misinformation that was stated by the head coach when being grilled by media personnel is his statement that the Bangladesh team had a 20 point advantage over Sri Lanka in the ODI rankings. The head coach needs to be educated that Bangladesh only has a 13 point advantage over us and that too after the recent losses at the Asia Cup 2018 where a team loses more points when defeated by a lower ranked team. It is extremely surprising to learn that the head coach is unaware of the standing of his team in the ICC rankings. Under such circumstances, nobody needs to be surprised at what is on show.
As a responsible national newspaper the Daily News is laying out these startling revelations for the benefit of the Minister of Sports who we are confident is resolved to take decisive action and set a new course for this rudderless ship, and steer it back towards winning ways.
