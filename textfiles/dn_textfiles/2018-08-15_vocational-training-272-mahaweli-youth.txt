Vocational training for 272 Mahaweli youth

The Mahaweli culture created under the giant Mahaweli irrigation scheme and massive human settlement endeavour producing skilled farmers, sportspersons and artistes from 1979 will be revived to revitalise the national economy,Mahaweli Development State Minister Weerakumara Dissanayake said.
"Agriculture and livestock projects under the Mahaweli scheme contributed largely to increase national productivity while producing skilled farmers. That culture has suffered a set back now. Today, the Mahaweli is dominated by the fourth generation of its original settlers.A large number of Mahaweli youth have no employment. It is our duty to direct them for the skills development and vocational training in order to uplift their livelihoods,” he said.
Scholarships will be given to 272 Mahaweli youth to follow vocational training courses atthe Vocational Training Authority.
Science, Technology and Research, Skills Development and Vocational Training State Minister Lakshman Seneviratne said vocational training plays an important role in responding to the market demand for skilled, qualified and capable individuals.
"The national universities can accommodate only 2% of the total student population who sit for their GCE A/L’s. We must guide youth for the vocational training programmes to produce skilled youth to meet the requirements in both local and foreign job markets. Opportunities are available for youth who have vocational qualifications. Most of them earn good incomes. In Sri Lanka, there is a shortage for 200,000 people which we have to fill with labour from overseas," the State Minister said.
The Mahaweli youth can face any challenge but they should improve their skills through the vocational training. After the late Minister Gamini Dissanayke, it is present President Maithripala Sirisena gave a new a new lease on life to the Mahaweli Project with the commencement of the Moragahakanda project benefiting people in North-Central,Northern, Eastern and North-Western provinces.
An agreement was signed between the Vocational Training Authority and the Mahaweli Authority to grant scholarships for 272 Mahaweli youth to follow vocational training courses.
