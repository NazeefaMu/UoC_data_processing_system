From crisis to sustenance – Part 23
Inspiring bosses lead from their hearts, invest their hearts in their people and let them grow

There has been a debate for years about what makes a leader. This debate has resulted in two schools of thought. One school proposes that leaders are made from a select few unique of individuals, born with a rare set of leadership abilities – leaders are born. The other school of thought proposes that leaders are made, that we learn, grow and develop into leaders – leaders are made.
Warren Bennis is an American university professor, organizational consultant and author, widely regarded as a pioneer of the contemporary field of Leadership studies. He spent a significant amount of time studying leaders and leadership. He also spent time on the faculties of Harvard and Boston University, an author of over 30 books and an adviser to four United States presidents. After as significant amount of research on leadership, he came to the following conclusion:
“The most dangerous leadership myth is that leaders are born – that there is a genetic factor to leadership. This myth asserts that people simply either have certain charismatic qualities or not. That’s nonsense; in fact, the opposite is true. Leaders are made rather than born.”
“The truth is that major capacities and competencies of leadership can be learned if the basic desire to learn them exists. It turns out that the vast majority of leaders are made through focused effort, hard work and daily action.”
No one would say leadership is easy, but the rewards are great! In making the commitment to be a role model, to look positively at the future, to encourage his people to be the best that they can be and then thank them for their efforts, leaders are fostering not only their own development,but positively moving his people into the future.
Attributes
There are four attributes that compel people to follow a leader, includingthat the leader be honest, forward-looking, inspiring and competent. People who work with such leaders are significantly more satisfied, committed, energized,and productive.
Writing in in his book, Executive Excellence, Joseph Folkman reports on “improving nine leadership behaviours has the greatest impact on employee satisfaction and commitment.
The following are those 9 behaviours.
1. Inspire and motivate others. Leaders who effectively inspire and motivate others have high energy and enthusiasm. They energize their team to achieve goals and increase performance.
2. Driving for results. The drive for results is vital; however, some leaders are all push (drive for results) and no pull (inspiration), which reduces motivation. A healthy balance is necessary.
3. Strategic perspective. Leaders who provide their team with a definite sense of direction and purpose have more satisfied and committed employees. These leaders paint a clear perspective between the overall picture and the details of day-to-day activities.
4. Collaboration. When leaders show that they can achieve objectives that require a high level of cooperation, they create synergy, and everyone enjoys the work more.
5. Walk the talk. Being honest and acting with integrity creates a more satisfied and committed workforce. Leaders need to be role models and set a good example.
6. Trust. Leaders engender trust by becoming aware of employee concerns, aspirations, and circumstances; projecting deep expertise, knowledge, and confidence in making informed decisions; being consistent and predictable; and exhibiting honesty and integrity.
7. Develops and supports others. When leaders help employees to develop new skills and abilities, employees have higher satisfaction and commitment, and become higher performers and more promotable. Effective leaders are thrilled by the success of others.
8. Building relationships. Leaders who stay in touch with employee concerns engender higher employee satisfaction and commitment. Such leaders balance getting results with a concern for other’s needs.
9. Courage. The leaders with the highest employee satisfaction and commitment are courageous. They don’t shy away from conflicts. They deal with issues head-on; when they see the first signs of problems within their teams, they address it directly and candidly.”
This is an excellent checklist for personal leadership development or to assess or review the skills of anyone on your team or in your organization that you’re trying to develop to increase employee engagement.
Inspire and motivate
Today, we will take item (1)-Inspire and motivate others and study it in detail. We will discuss the balance in future instalments.
Effective leaders know how to motivate employees by motivating team members to want to do what needs to be done by effectively using these three motivational factors. (1) Appreciation,(2) Involvement and (3) Awareness of personal situations. Many people are surprised to discover that money is not one of the top three.
Motivation in the workplace is often linked to money, and with good reason. Getting a paycheck is one of the main reasons people go to work in the first place. But as far as a reason, or motive, for completing tasks, it’s not very high on the list.
Even if you inherit new team members from another department and you know nothing about the people you’ll be leading, you can tailor these three factors so they will motivate the entire team. This is how leaders create sustainable, high performing teams.
Now, let’s take a look at the top motivational factor – appreciation which is the most powerful motivator. Though it’s the most powerful of the three factors, appreciation must be used appropriately; that old saying about “too much of a good thing” definitely applies here.
If an employee hears how great he is doing every day - no matter what quality of work he’s turning out - this appreciation becomes meaningless to him. It comes across as a fake managerial tactic to coerce him to get the work done.
Words of praise don’t work for everyone. In fact, they can turn some people off. The trick here is to know what each person will respond to, and make sure that they get it.
Appreciating people correctly
Let’s take, what is known as “bicycle analogy” to see how a leader can utilize appreciation most effectively in correlation with communication priorities. The various ‘Technical’ skills - engineering, accountancy, computers, trades etc. - that enable business owners to get started are what can be described as Rear Wheel skills. They are functional and drive the business along. It is necessary to be good at these and keep the processes - the chains, cogs and gears - well oiled.
Unfortunately, the possession of rear wheel skill is only half of what is needed. In order to expand and develop the business the owner manager also requires effective Front Wheel skills. These are the more personal human skills - communication, interpersonal and analytical. For a business to grow it needs the owner manager or managers to effectively communicate its rear wheel skills to customers. Sales and marketing is more about front wheel than rear wheel skills.
Back wheel communicators need recognition to be very tangible, in the forms of accomplishments, tasks completed or goals achieved. Front wheel communicators need recognition to be intangible - that is, touchy-feely, emotional and expressive.
Now, let’s add in communication pace:
Faster-paced, back wheel communicators are motivated by public, tangible appreciation. These team members tend to have large houses and luxury cars. Their offices commonly have the walls full of plaques and awards. Publicly given, tangible signs of appreciation keep them motivated because they like having something that they and others can see.
Faster-paced, front wheel communicators are motivated by one-minute praise sessions. Intangible terms like “wonderful work,” “fabulous improvement” and “outstanding job” motivate these team members. They are likely to not only show you their letters of praise from clients, but ask you to read them aloud, and to post them on the department bulletin board as well. To them, public praise is an instant turn off. Meet with these team members one-on-one to communicate with them and use phrases such as “the team” and “the contributions your team has made.”
Short advices to bring inspiration:
Find out what they need. Be respectful, Stop micromanaging. Lead by example, Be personable, Stress your company’s purpose, Do what you say, Be decisive, Show emotions, Push their limits, Admit when you don’t have the answer, Don’t impose fear, Develop future leaders from within, Encourage personal growth, Help overcome weakness, Hold your team accountable, Ask a lot of questions, Demonstrate knowledge, Be flexible, Understand your purpose, Welcome involvement, Get to know your team, Be transparent, Hold brainstorming sessions, Be accessible.
Human capital
Drawing insight from Eastern philosophy, we can conclude like this: “If we want to change the way of being, we have to change the way of doing.” This strikes us as profound in the moment and even more profound over time – and the sentiment matches what we learned in our study. Leaders can only change by doing things differently. The more often they behave in a new way, the sooner they become a new type of leader, an inspirational leader. We know that individual inspiration is the gateway to employee discretionary energy, and that, in turn, is critical to making the most of your scarcest resource – your human capital
Valuing inspiration throughout an organization teaches everyone to be more aware, reflective, and empathetic. Ultimately, a team that reinforces the core principles of inspiration will have a competitive edge, and a more productive and resilient future.
