Group of 16 to join JO

SLFP MP and former Minister John Seneviratne said yesterday that the group of 16 SLFP MPs who left the Unity Government recently have decided to support the Joint Opposition and will be joining their meetings from next week.
Addressing a media briefing in Colombo yesterday, MP Seneviratne said the group of 16 MPs held two successful meetings in Matara and Matale and based on the public response, they decided to support the JO.
“Accordingly, we have decided to support the JO in Parliament as well as all its future political deliberations. Our aim is to change the present government and begin an anti- UNP drive," he added.
“SLFP MP and former Minister Dilan Perera said that movement of the 16 MPs has the support of many professionals, intellectuals and academics. We hope to mobilize people from all sectors and get their support to form an anti- UNP force. We expect their support at upcoming elections,” he added.
The US which co-sponsored the resolution against Sri Lanka at the United Nations Human Rights Council (UNHRC) has now withdrawn from it. In this backdrop, the government must decide whether it should carry on some of the Geneva agreements.
“During many previous occasions, we have seen Opposition members formed as groups joining the government to get posts. But, we are the only group which gave up ministerial posts by joining hands against the government," he said.
