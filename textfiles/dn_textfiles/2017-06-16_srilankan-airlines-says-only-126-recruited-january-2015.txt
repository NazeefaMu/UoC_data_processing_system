SriLankan Airlines says only 126 recruited from January 2015

SriLankan Airlines yesterday refuted recent media reports that the airline has made 1250 new appointments under the current Director Board.
A company statement said that only 126 have been recruited to the company from January 2015 to May 2017. There are 7029 currently employed in the airline.
The airline in a statement added that the vacancies filled include management trainees, cadet pilots, airport service delivery and additional security personnel recruited due to the increased number of flights and the statutory requirement stipulated by the Civil Aviation Authority to enhance airside security for catering. This accounts for the net inflow of 91 out of the total of 126.
“The Airline’s fleet has increased from 19 aircraft on January 31, 2015 to 24 aircraft on May 31, 2017 which is a 26 per cent increase,”the statement said.
