Eight freshers attached to the Peradeniya University’s Agriculture Faculty who had been subjected to torture in the name of ragging by a group of second-year students of the same faculty by taking them to a rented house in Megoda Kalugamuwa Peradeniya, stripping them naked and assaulting them with clubs were rescued by the Peradeniya police.
The police raided the house around 11.20 pm on February 19. They arrested 15 second-year students in this connection. They are alleged to have maintained this house as a torture chamber. The eight freshers subjected to this degrading ragging have been admitted to the Peradeniya hospital for treatment.
Police said investigations revealed that these second-year students had rented this house on January 2 at Rs. 10,000 per month for a period of three months by paying the money in full posing as architects attached to a form of architects.
The half-complete house belonged to a minor employee attached to the Galaha MoH office. Police believe that this house may have been used for ragging new entrants on earlier occasions too.
