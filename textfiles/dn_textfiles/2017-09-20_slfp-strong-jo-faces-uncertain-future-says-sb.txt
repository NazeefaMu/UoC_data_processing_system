SLFP strong, JO faces uncertain future, says SB

Whatever the Joint Opposition (JO) says, the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) has been strengthened to successfully face the forthcoming elections, Social Empowerment, Welfare and Kandyan Heritage Minister S.B.Dissanayake said.
The Minister who was addressing the media at his Ministry yesterday said that SLFP nomination lists for every electorate for the Local Government(LG) election have already been prepared.
He added that certain former Local Government members, responsible for various acts of misconduct have joined hands with the JO. ‘Such corrupt persons have not been included on the SLFP nomination lists. All of them are with the JO and will contest the Local Government polls under the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna banner” he said.
According to Minister Dissanayake, it is only a matter of time before the JO disintergrates and splits into factions before the LG polls.
Besides, Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) will also collapse with the announcing of the LG polls. “If not the SLPP will experience a bitter result at the LG polls,” Minister Dissanayake said.
Asked whether the ban for field officers including Samurdhi officers to contest the LG election will be amended, the Minister said that it is a good move when it comes to safeguarding democracy.
“Samurdhi officers have more duties at village level than contesting for elections.
It doesn’t matter contesting elections after resigning from the post. Samurdhi officers are duty bound to serve people especially at rural level rather than contesting elections,” the Minister noted.
He said that it was Mahinda Rajapaksa who decided to handover the Chairmanship of the SLFP to Maithripala Sirisena.
“He took that decision personally. But, now Rajapkasa is making various statements,” he said.
