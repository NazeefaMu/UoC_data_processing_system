The university was originally named “Liverpool Mechanics Institute” and was followed by the Liverpool Institute, School of Art and the Liverpool Nautical College. In 1900 a campus was opened by Irene Mabel Marsh. These institutes combined to lay the foundation for Liverpool John Moores University which has grown and flourished over the years to provide opportunities for all those who aspired to obtain a quality higher education. Today it is a vibrant community of 25,000 students from over 100 countries worldwide with 2500 staff and 250 degree courses.

Lateral entry to the third year is available for HND holders for a duration of one year. The degree courses offered by SLIIT are approved by the University Grants Commission under the Universities Act.
