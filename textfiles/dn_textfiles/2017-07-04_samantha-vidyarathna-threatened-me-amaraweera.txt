Samantha Vidyarathna threatened me: Amaraweera

Mahaweli Development State Minister and Fisheries Minister Mahinda Amaraweera who inspected houses damaged as a result of the Uma Oya development project at Makulu Ella, yesterday said that he was threatened by Uva Provincial Councillor Samantha Vidyarathna.
“Samantha Vidyarathana demanded me to give him a straightforward answer whether the government was ready to stop the Uma Oya development project or not,” Minister Amaraweera said. He said he could not give a statement as demanded by the JVP provincial councillor.
“The experts will take a decision whether the project is continued or not following a study,” he said.
Addressing the media at the Bandarawela Irrigation office, Amaraweera said a meeting with all stakeholders of the Uma Oya project, scheduled to be held at the Bandarawela Divisional Secretariat, was cancelled.
He said he received information that JVP provincial Councillor Vidyarathna has organised a group of persons to disrupt the meeting to gain political mileage.
Amaraweera said he was among two other ministers who were appointed to look into the problems faced by the people in the area.
“We are not looking at issues with political objectives in mind,” he said.
