The Foreigner
Chan vs Bond

He is mostly known as the martial arts maestro because of the recent projects he did but Jackie Chan has proven his mettle in the investigative thriller movies in many timeless movies like ‘Dragon Blade’ and the ‘Rush Hour’ series.
Now after a considerable span the seasoned actor jumps back into action movies with ‘The Foreigner’. Directed by ‘Bond’ director Martin Campbell, the film sees Chan take on a character which has similar traits to the legendary James Bond.
Chan takes on the role of a man seeking vengeance for the death of his daughter in a bloody London bombing. His equal is a grizzled former 007 himself, Pierce Brosnan as former IRA member and Irish Deputy Minister Liam Hennessy. Brosnan attempts to politick his way around the aftermath of the bombing, which is claimed by a rogue IRA cell.
‘The Foreigner’ is adapted from Stephen Leather’s novel ‘The Chinaman’. This is evident in the manner in which Chan’s character is addressed as ‘the Chinaman’ throughout the story though his actual name is Quan Ngoc Minh.
A drawback in the movie is that the creators seem to have decided to take Chan and scatter a few antagonist roles around him. There is plenty of action but little depth or variety. The cat and mouse game which is found in many films of this nature is seen here as well. Though it keeps the viewers engaged, it can be a bore at times.
Chan stands out in his role as the brooding yet simple and serious. The sober nature of his character is what sets him apart from the comic action characters he has taken up so far in many projects. He is a father who is morning the loss of his beloved child and this sets him in a new light in the audience’s eyes. Hence slapstick comedy is not a part of this project. The film is too dark for any comic scenes.
One of the most powerful moments in the film is when police officers visit Minh. As question him about who he would like to call his reply tugs the viewer’s heartstrings. The fact that he has no one else in his family is reflected by his blank expression which signals his loss of hopes and emotion. such emotions are raw and compliment the characters.
Brosnan too does well as the baddie. His character is also modified to cater to the present setup.
Campbell’s ‘Bond’ influence is present in ‘The Foreigner’. The director who rebooted movies like ‘Golden Eye’ and ‘Casino Royale’ manages to pull it all off with some smart thinking and directing skills. However it lacks aspirations to really stand out as a masterpiece. ‘The Foreigner’ may not exactly be a winner but it is no loser either.
