'Shop Til U Drop 2017'  at Taj Samudra

Colombo VIP Night presented its second one-day shopping extravaganza Shop Til U Drop 2017 on Saturday, October 21, at the Taj Samudra Hotel - Grand Marquee.
This premium lifestyle shopping festival saw over 40 retailers in fashion, perfumes, jewellery, home decor, X'mas decor, flowers, wellness, baby care and more offering their products. Attractive promotions and discounts were on offer.
A special feature of this event was that shoppers also had the opportunity to view demonstrations and engage in fun activities. “Colombo VIP Night continued to be a great place to network, connect with old and new friends and have fun in a safe environment. Shop Til U Drop was specially created in response to client demand. We added a little twist and introduced fun activities together with demos that promote local premier brands. Its like shopping in a mall all in one hall,” said Latika Alok, event producer.
