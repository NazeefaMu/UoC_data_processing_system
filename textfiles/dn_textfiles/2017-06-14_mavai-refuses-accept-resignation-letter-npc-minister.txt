Mavai refuses to accept resignation letter of NPC minister

The Ilankai Thamil Arasu Katchi (ITAK) has refused to accept the resignation letter of Northern Provincial Council Education Minister T. Gurukularaja.
ITAK General Secretary and MP Mavai Senathirajah had refused to accept the resignation letter until all allegations against Gurukularaja were fully probed.
Last week, a three member committee appointed by Chief Minister C. V. Wigneswaran submitted a report on allegations against Gurukularaja and the Provincial Agriculture Minister P. Ingaranesan.
After the report was handed over to the Chief Minister, a majority of the members in the Council demanded that the two ministers should be removed.
Gurukularaja and Ingaranesan were accused of corruption, abuse of power and misuse of funds.
It was reported that Gurukularaja had temporarily stepped down from his position until allegations were fully probed. It was also reported that the alleged Provincial Council Ministers had failed to submit their explanations within the stipulated time.
