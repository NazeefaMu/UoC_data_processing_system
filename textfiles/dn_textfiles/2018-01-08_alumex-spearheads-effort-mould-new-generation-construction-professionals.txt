Alumex spearheads effort to mould new generation of construction professionals

Even as Sri Lanka’s construction sector continues to enjoy an unprecedented level of growth and development – rising to a rate of 9.3% Year-on-Year in the second quarter of 2017, the construction industry itself is finding it increasingly difficult to find labour – skilled or unskilled – to meet the rapidly increasing demand for high quality residential and commercial space.
The growing shortage of labour in the construction sector has led to remarkable opportunities for growth, skills development, and the possibility of exponential income growth for those willing to put in the work.

Having first established its Aluminium Fabrication training programme in 1998 Alumex – Sri Lanka’s pioneering extruder and manufacturer of aluminium profiles – has provided extensive practical training to over 15,000 fabricators free of charge.
According to Alumex Managing Director, Rohan Peris, this initiative was first established in order to ensure that the products which Alumex manufactured would be fabricated and installed correctly, in order to ensure that the company’s reputation for producing Sri Lanka’s highest quality aluminium products would not be tarnished.
“Our reputation for excellence is something we take very seriously and with aluminium products, you have to be very careful in how they are fabricated. Soon after we started this project, it became increasingly clear to us that this initiative was much bigger than just our company. The impact that this training was having on people’s lives, was truly remarkable, and we take great inspiration from the many success stories that Alumex’s training programmes has helped to create over the past 19 years,” Peris explained.
One of the programme’s greatest success stories is Nalin Narampanawa, Managing Director of Nova Creations. A participant who joined the programme near its inception, Nalin shared his remarkable journey from his home village near Anuradhapura which he left with just a few thousand rupees to start training with Alumex.
“I made the decision to come to Colombo after I was commissioned with the task of fabricating an aluminium window at our village school. At the time, I was involved in making photo frames using aluminium profiles, and very basic work like that.
“The principal told me he had a job for me and while I didn’t have much experience, I decided to take it up as a challenge. But I quickly realized that it was much more complicated than I had imagined,” Narampanawa explained.
Given the material’s durability and versatility, he realized that aluminium fabrication would be a skill that would only grow in demand, and therefore sought out help to develop his own expertise in the subject.
Classroom training
Today, Nalin is a successful entrepreneur in his own right, managing his own workshop that employs 30 youths from across the island, including his home district of Anuradhapura.
Another alumnus of this programme is Roshini Samaranayaka, Managing Director of Wijetunga Constructions. Having qualified as a civil engineer at the University of Moratuwa, Roshini noted that despite her extensive academic training, Alumex’s programme had given her a strong advantage in her industry thanks to the hands on experience in sophisticated aluminium fabrication techniques it provided.
“It is a common misconception that aluminium fabrication is a ‘man’s job’ – there’s no such thing. I had a female fabricator who worked under me, received the training and started a workshop of her own. All it takes is passion, practice and precision and anyone who works at this job can earn well.”
Roshini highlighted how Alumex’s comprehensive training had proven invaluable in helping her to select the best profiles for each job, while the technical training gave her the knowhow necessary as a fabricator to speak to clients with confidence.
Demand for buildings that are furnished and fitted with aluminium is also on the rise, given the material’s remarkable versatility and durability. These dynamics have made aluminium fabrication an increasingly vital part of Stylish Windows Lanka (Pvt) Ltd’s business.
Established in 2012, the company has grown to be one of Alumex’s most sought-after firms for aluminium fabrication. Stylish Windows Managing Director, L.C. Lakshman Perera notes that it was the invaluable training and unwavering support of Alumex that enabled their continuing success.
“Since receiving the training from Alumex, I have taken on major projects like Pegasus Reef Hotel, Anantara Hotel in Chilaw and Weligama Bay Marriott and completed them successfully. The training has been a key turning point in my life as it helped me to unlearn whatever I learned from being a helper for years and learn everything properly, once and for all”
“Not only has Alumex given us a good training, it also keeps us constantly updated on new technology, designs to make sure that we’re thorough and conversant with the global trends,” Perera said.
Currently working out of a relative’s property Jegatheesan hails from Jaffna and travelled to Colombo to start working in the construction sector as helper, before eventually commencing his training with Alumex.
“Not just during the training but also after we completed the course, all of our instructors have been very accessible and helpful to us. Even now if we have a question, we can speak to them and get answers on anything to do with aluminium fabrication. Today I have four youth – including two from Jaffna and from Ratnapura - working with me and I have recommended the course to them as well.
“Once they are also trained, we will be able to take on larger projects and in this way I am confident that I will be able to expand our business and get our own space to build a workshop in the near future.”
