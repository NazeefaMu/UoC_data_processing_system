Joes go out favourites but Rajans can pull off a surprise

St. Joseph’s College Maradana will once again go out as favourites as they have a slight edge over their opponents when they take on one of the most unpredictable teams this season in Dharmaraja College Kandy, who can pull off a surprise win in their Milo 'A' division inter-school knockout rugby tournament first semi-final match at the Sugathadasa Stadium today at 4.15pm.
Dharmaraja kicked off this season losing to formidable league runners up Isipathana College, league champs Royal College, St. Joseph’s College and St. Anthony's College Kandy but went on to beat St. Peter’s College and D.S. Senanayake College in the just concluded Singer league rugby tournament.
They were really fortunate to receive a walkover in the quarterfinals of the knockout when league champs Royal College pulled out of the Milo knockout due to injuries to several of their top players. Rajans thus went straight into the semi-finals.
The Josephians started the season with two losses after close battles against Royal and Isipathana before beating Dharmaraja College Kandy, St. Anthony’s College Kandy, arch rivals St. Peter’s College, D.S. Senanayake College and S. Thomas’ College ML before losing to Wesley College and Trinity College in the league.
In the ongoing Milo knockout championship quarterfinal match Joes ran out winners by beating Wesley 43-29 in a tense game.
Meanwhile Dharmaraja will have to watch out for the opposition speedy three quarters and have to match their opponents really well to prevent St. Joseph’s from scoring through their famous three quarter moves. The two forward packs are evenly matched; hence a close tussle for supremacy can be expected in today's game.
St. Joseph’s will be led by experienced Sri Lanka junior national winger Vinul Fernando with fly half Chathura Seneviratne as their play maker. They are coached by ex- Kingswoodian Nilfer Ibrahim.
Playmaker Chamika Perera will captain Dharmaraja with former Isipathanian Kapila Silva as their head coach.
Whoever wins this encounter will have a berth in next week’s all important final on Saturday June 24 under floodlights at Race Course International Stadium.
