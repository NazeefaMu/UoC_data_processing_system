Sanjeewa wins PFGP

The Pin Fernando Grand Prix April edition sponsored by UTE Engineering played at the picturesque Par 70 Army Diyatalawa Golf Course for the first time saw B.A. Sanjeewa returning a 71 final round to emerge winner 3 strokes from J M D Indika who gained ground with his outstanding final round of 66 which established the Course Record for the Army Diyatalawa Golf Course.
The relatively short but challenging Course provided a great experience to the National players and the New Course record of 66 (4under Par) was set by J M D Indika, in the Final Round of the UTE Engineering PFGP April Event.
Indika fired 8 birdies (Four in each half) dropped 4 strokes with two Bogey’s and one Double Bogey but established a new Course Record. Amarapathma repeated his 3 under Par in Round 3 to snatch third place 5 strokes behind the winner.
The Army Diyatalawa Golf Club produced excellent Course conditions, with the Greens and Fairways in great shape helped by the weather gods who sent rain overnight. The mountainous terrain and unique features of the Diyatalawa Golf Course was a true test for the national players and the standard of Golf was commendable.
The UTE Engineering Pin Fernando Grand Prix journey continues with the May Edition at the RCGC. The performances of each Grand Prix edition count for the WAGR (World Amateur Golf Rankings) with several leading Sri Lankan players earning World Amateur Ranking points.
