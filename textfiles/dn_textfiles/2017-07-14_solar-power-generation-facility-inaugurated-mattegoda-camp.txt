Solar power generation facility inaugurated at Mattegoda camp

Sri Lanka Army Engineers camp complex at Mattegoda where Corps of Field Engineers are based, inaugurated its solar power generation facility for the Officers’ Mess and the Officers’ accommodation building during a ceremony, recently.
Chief of Defence Staff (CDS) General Crisanthe de Silva was the chief guest.
The 12 kw micro solar power unit was gifted to the ‘Home of Sappers’ by Takima Tech Lanka (Pvt) Ltd following a request made earlier by the Army during the former Commander’s tenure of office.
General Crisanthe De Silva who is also from the Corps of Engineers, together with Mr and Mrs Kotaki Masato, Chairman, Takima Tech Lanka (Pvt) Ltd and Sahida Hettiarchchi, Chairman, Serendip Green Company was warmly received by Major General Sudantha Ranasinghe, Colonel Commandant of the Sri Lanka Engineers (SLE) and Chief Field Engineer, Major General Dananjith Karunaratne.
At the entrance, the Chief Guest unveiled the new signboard ‘Home of the Sappers’ before he was conducted to the venue of the inauguration of the solar power project.
A formal welcome address by the Chief Field Engineer, followed by a presentation on the project by a donor’s representative during the brief ceremony set the stage ready for the inauguration of the solar power project.
General Crisanthe de Silva, flanked by other distinguished guests and representatives of the donor company, switched on the system.
The Chief Guest and the Colonel Commandant presented mementos to Mr and Mrs Kotaki Masato as symbols of gratitude and goodwill. The gesture was reciprocated. This solar power project, proposed by the former Commander of the Army when he was in office, coincided with the government’s ongoing community-oriented power generation project ‘Soorya Bala Sangramaya’ (Battle for Solar Energy), aimed at establishing one million micro solar power units across island-wide houses.
Several Senior Officers and invitees were also present.
