UTE ENGINEERING PIN FERNANDO GRAND PRIX
Veteran Amarapadma wins June edition

The June Edition of the Pin Fernando Grand-Prix powered by UTE Engineering was played for the first occasion at the Sri Lanka Air Force Eagles Golf Links in Trincomallee, in sunny and windy conditions.
The Course overall was very tight and scoring round the greens was a challenge, but seasoned veteran Narahenpitage Amarapadma, a former Sri Lanka Open Champion and Grand Prix winner many times over, lead the June Edition from start to finish and completed a comfortable six stroke victory over B A Sanjeewa, the PFGP 2017 number 1 Ranked player.
The PFGP 2018 standings leader prior to the June Edition rallied in the final round returning a 2 over par 74, the best score in the four rounds of the event, to share joint third place tied on 328, with J M D Indika and M U Chanaka Perera.
By virtue of the best last round Sisira Kumara would clinch the second Runner-up prize. The proud sponsorship by UTE Engineering, facilitated the Pin Fernando Grand-Prix to be played around the Golf Courses in beautiful Sri Lanka, providing varying conditions and tough circumstances in preparation of the National team to represent Sri Lanka at the Asian Games 2018 in August.
A comprehensive training program, under the watchful eyes of the Sri Lanka Golf Union, is underway, with the National Selectors too keeping a close eye on the overall performances on and off the field.
