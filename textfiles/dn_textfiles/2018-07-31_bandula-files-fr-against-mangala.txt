Bandula files FR against Mangala

Colombo District Parliamentarian Bandula Gunawardena yesterday filed a Fundamental Rights petition in the Supreme Court seeking an order directing the Minister of Finance and Mass Media and Ministry Secretary to refrain from further publishing advertisements containing alleged inaccurate and misleading information by using public funds.
The petitioner said that on or about May 20, 2018, he he came to know an advertisement published in English, Sinhala and Tamil newspapers by the Ministry of Finance on crude oil and fuel prices of Sri Lanka.
The petitioner said the advertisement contained inaccurate and distorted details and information.
MP Gunawardena said respondents published the advertisements by using the public funds entrusted to them, knowing that the advertisements were carrying inaccurate information to deliberately mislead the public and with malicious political motives.
This petition was filed through Senior Counsel Kanishka Vitharana.
