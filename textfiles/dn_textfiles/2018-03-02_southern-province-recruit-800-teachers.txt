Southern Province to recruit 800 teachers

Southern Province Education Minister Chandima Rasaputhra said 800 graduates would be appointed as teachers on March 12.
“There is a shortage of primary teachers countrywide,” he said. “Only 65 percent of vacancies for primary school teachers in the country and 70 percent in Southern Province have been filled,” Rasaputhra said.
“We expect to give appointments to 400 primary school dancing teachers. Dancing teachers who came from other provinces will be released after these appointments,” he added.
“We plan to recruit teachers for Mathematics, Science, Information Technology, Economics, and commerce. We will arrange an entrance examination for teachers. We intend to conduct an examination especially for English language teachers. Any graduate or diploma holder can apply. We hope to enroll them in training teacher training colleges,” he said.
