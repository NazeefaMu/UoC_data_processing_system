Kusa in Love

Irangani Kalutanthri, currently domiciled in Canada, is on holiday here in Sri Lanka. At the invitation of drama enthusiasts, she has revived her masterpiece Dutugamunu and is now ready with her second presentation Kusa Adara Kathava based on the love legend of Kusa Jatakaya.
The beautiful, heart-rending, love legend is presented very passionately selecting the most moving episodes, with a creative environment, and combined with beautiful lyrics and melodies, lingering long in the memory, it will entice audiences all ages. In Canada, with the talents and capabilities of the Sri Lankan expatriates, Kalutantri has successfully produced and presented Kusa Paba, to an audience filled to full capacity, mesmerizing them. She has done a few more productions such as ‘Glimpse of Lanka’, ‘Pride of Lanka’, ‘Shadows of Life’, ‘Abhimana Lanka’, and ‘Light of Asia’ and helped further illuminate the prestige of the mother country.
“I am a passionate lover of drama, to be more specific, lover of Art forms, music, dancing and, the entire aesthetic field. I have been active in this field for more than three decades. But I have never enjoyed such a blessing.”
Kalutanthri finds it hard to imagine how to garner some sponsorship. Quite strange, yet very true, this world needs a crowd to recognize the value of the arts in a community. It is important in today’s culture to be able to offer our community the being of what the arts can teach us.
Oscar Wilde says: “I regard the theatre as the greatest of all art forms, the most immediate way in which a human being can share with another, the sense of what it is to be a human being”.
Kalutanthri is pleased to offer good theatre to her patrons. Sadly though with today’s skyrocketing cost of production, it is rather difficult or unaffordable to engage in this philanthropic exercise.
Fine Arts have therapeutic value and bring tranquillity to the human mind.
Kusa Adara Kathawa will go on the boards at Tower Hall, Maradana, on April 1 at 2.30 and 6.30 pm. The cast includes a group of talented amateurs, chosen from the ocean of talents in Sri Lanka: Mulinda Bandara, Nalanda Kularatne, Meena Laxani, Sachini Nivarthana, Renuka Wijesinghe, Shanika Sewwandi, Shanaka Perera, Lakmal Wasantha, Champika Bandaranayaka, Sanjeewa Madushanka, Indika Chathuranga, Tharushi Hanshini, Dimuthu Danushika and Gayan Chathuranga, Music direction is by Lalith Amarasinghe, make-up by Palitha Abeylal, Directed and Produced by Irangani Kalutanthri and presented by the Youth Aesthetic foundation.
