LSSP against doctor’s strikes: Prof. Vitharana

"The Lanka Sama Samaja Party (LSSP) is against doctors' strikes. They should not strike putting poor patients' lives in danger. Instead, they should protest against the SAITM by supporting the struggle of the university students," LSSP leader Prof. Tissa Vitharana said.
He was addressing a press conference at the LSSP Head Quarters in Colombo yesterday. Prof. Vitharana said the SAITM should be regulated through the Sri Lanka Medical Council (SLMC). "It was the SLMC that should take decision on the SAITM, not the judiciary. A `Special Minister' cannot take technical decisions on behalf of the SLMC, he said. He said the Medical Faculty and the SAITM should be taken over by the government. Otherwise, it should function as a non-profit institution. "It is the same in other countries when it comes to private medical faculties," he said.
"If the SAITM becomes a non-profit service institution, it should offer 30 percent of scholarships for poor medical students with three A/L A passes.
The government can produce doctors required for the country without private sector participation," he said.
