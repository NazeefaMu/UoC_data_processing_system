Fruitarian gran turns back the clock

A glamorous gran who lives on a diet of fruit said her new lifestyle has left her with the body of an “athlete”.
Belinda White, who calls herself a fruitarian, became a vegan overnight after learning about nutrition when training to become a yoga teacher. The extreme lifestyle haul didn’t go down well with her family at first, who enjoyed a treat of burgers and ice cream. But Belinda, 46, credits her diet to making her look half her age - and proudly claimed she’s the “female Benjamin Button”.
The mum-of-three now survives on fruit - also snacking on some veg and nuts - and eats up to 20 pieces a day.
She said: “I am the female Benjamin Button.”
Her partner of four years, engineer Jason Holden, 37, and two youngest boys, Tom, 18, and Joe, 13, were initially reluctant. But singer Belinda, of Rotherham, South Yorks., was so passionate about the ban, she considered splitting up with meat-loving Jason if he didn’t adopt her new way of life.
She won him and the boys over and now, two years after the shakeup, they eat a completely vegan diet while Belinda, is a fruitarian. Belinda, whose favourite fruit is mango, says the diet has boosted her energy levels, cured her fibromyalgia and reduced her pain from osteoarthritis “by 95 per cent”.
But above all, she says ridding her body of animal products has made her cellulite dissolve, improved her hair, skin and nails and made her look decades younger.
Healthy lifestyle
Belinda, who has a grandson called Theo after her eldest son, Daniel White, 26, became a dad six weeks ago, said: “I feel better in every way. It is almost like returning to my youth.
“I feel like I have turned the clock backwards. It’s incredible. I look like I’m 28 but I’m 46. I’ve lost about two stone and my partner lost around two stone and had terrible psoriasis all over his body which has now cleared considerably. Before, I just felt old. I couldn’t get up the stairs because I was in so much pain due to the osteoarthritis in my hips and I was on three different pills a day. Since doing this, I take no medication and I’m teaching yoga four times a week. My physical body has gone like it was when I was in my twenties. My cellulite has dissolved and my pain from osteo arthritis has been reduced by 90 per cent.”
Belinda said she and her family always lived what they thought was a healthy lifestyle, limiting red meat, eating chicken and fish and avoiding junk food binges.
But instead of having a bacon roll for breakfast, she now eats half a watermelon and drinks a water with lemon juice which acts like an internal body wash.
She then heads to work armed with two giant flasks of smoothies, packed with eight bananas, dates and frozen fruit like mangoes for lunch, instead of a Greggs.
For dinner, she eats avocados, cherry tomatoes, mung beans and peppers, washed down with a huge glass of orange juice.
When she fancies a treat, she gorges on energy balls of medjool dates, cashew nuts, raw cocoa powder and coconut which “taste like Ferrero Rochers”.
Though they’ve now accepted the new diet and way of life now, Belinda said Jason and her boys didn’t like it at all at first.
High cholesterol
She said: “I was so strong about it that I was prepared to end my relationship with him, which sounds extreme. But to be intimate with someone and share the body smells... When you become a vegan, especially when your diet is clean, you don’t have the same BO or breath.”
Belinda claims that even her doctors have been blown away by the improvement in her health.
She said: “A few years ago, I would have considered veganism to be very extreme. But the effects on me have been amazing. I feel more like I have halted the ageing and I am now turning the clock back. I got a doctor to test everything and my results were just so good and incredible that the hospital said I was like an athlete.” 
Belinda said that watching documentaries, including Vegucated and Earthlings, showed her that we are “conditioned and brainwashed as children to eat this way”.
She said: “I realised that the number one killer in our country is heart disease caused by high cholesterol and in my opinion, meat and dairy cause this type of blockage. I thought, how can I justify teaching people about peace, kindness and love and then sit and eat an innocent animal that died a horrific death and feed it to my children? People should do what I’ve done because I believe that each and every person who hears this, something inside them realises that it is the truth.”
“Every single person deserves the right to a healthy life. I want to be the example. I want people to see me and my children and be inspired. Anyone who is suffering should try this as something inside of you instinctively knows it will help.”
The results of a full blood count taken from Belinda in May show that she is perfectly healthy and thriving on her fruitarian diet.
Nutritionist Nicola Burgher-Kennedy said eating an all-fruit diet can help you shed the pounds.
“It is possible that eating an all fruit diet can cause some weight loss because fruits are low in fat and calories,” she said.
“You can also get the benefits of a healthy weight from consuming a healthy balanced diet as well as obtaining the nutrients the body needs to be healthy and happy.”
She added that fruits also provide antioxidants and phytonutrients which “can reduce the risk of chronic diseases like some cancers”.
