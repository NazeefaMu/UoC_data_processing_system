Changi Airport unveils upcoming Terminal 4

Changi Airport unveiled its soon-to-be-opened Terminal 4 (T4). The terminal presents a new travel experience with its boutique design and innovative use of technology.
T4 will be the first terminal at Changi Airport to offer end-to-end Fast and Seamless Travel (FAST) for departing passengers.
With the extensive use of technology, including facial recognition software, FAST redefines the passenger's travel experience, enhances operational efficiency and raises productivity.
Passengers will enjoy the flexibility of checking in at their own convenience, without having to wait for counters to open. FAST will also yield productivity gains with manpower savings of about 20% expected in the longer term, when operations have stabilised.
T4 has a total floor area of 225,000 square metres including the two-storey terminal, car parks and taxi deck. The project was completed after three years of construction. Although just half the size of Terminal 3 (T3), the planners and designers of T4 have managed to deliver a terminal that will have a capacity of 16 million passenger movements a year, two-thirds that of T3.
T4's design theme is fun, vibrant and positively surprising. There is a sense of space - a hallmark of Changi Airport - brought about by a high ceiling and height limits for equipment and machines. The terminal's showpiece is a Central Galleria (300m long x 18m wide x 23m high) which separates the public zone from the transit area.
Due to its compact size, T4 will have centralised areas for departure and arrival immigration as well as pre-board security screening. This provides for more optimised deployment of manpower and equipment.
Nine airlines will operate at T4 - the Air Asia Group (of four airlines), Cathay Pacific, Cebu Pacific, Korean Air, Spring Airlines and Vietnam Airlines. Together, they serve an estimated eight million passengers at Changi Airport each year.
Two lounges - Cathay Pacific's First and Business Class Lounge and SATS PPG Blossom Lounge, a pay-per-use lounge managed by SATS and Plaza Premium - are located at level 2M within the transit area.
With T4, the total handling capacity of Changi Airport will be raised to 82 million passengers per annum. There will thus be more capacity at Changi's terminals to support the growth plans of all airlines.
