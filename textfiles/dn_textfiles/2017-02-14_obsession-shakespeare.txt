In obsession with Shakespeare

Many playwrights knew success before Shakespeare arrived in the scene. The premature death of Christopher Marlow left the field open and gave Shakespeare every opportunity as enviously Robert Greene declared in a script that Bard beautified himself with the feathers of his illustrious predecessors, probably referring to Marlow and Thomas Kyd who wrote tragedies of high emotion and drama that were boarded at the Rose Theatre especially THE SPANISH TRAGESY that zoomed Kyd to a Reniassance man.
The University wits who found it hard to come to terms that Shakespeare wrote the works of his time found evidence of Shakespeare's personal life to be meager but no more that of most men of his time and rank and there was certainly enough to make nonsense of the idea that the man from Stratford did not write the plays. However his baptism and buriel entered in the register of Stratford Parish Church as well as the baptisms of his children and his marriage by special licence by the Bishop of Worcester, still exists.
Heterogeneous nature
Therefore, the University Wits drew a blank. They knew that his work as extraordinary was, came from his pen and left him alone.
Being one of Chamberilain's Men, Shakespeare knew how to exploit the resources according to the whims and fancy of nature of the heterogeneous nature of the audiences, the greatest works for production were all in place. As he left his rivals behind, and returned to the stage by end of 1594 along with such actors as William Kemp and Richard Burbage. Some moved away to join and pledged their support to Lord Howard of Effingham and established themselves at the Rose Theatre.
Permanent Playhouses were built in London to facilitate the growing theatre that demnded to showcase the work of dramatists apart from Marlowe and Kyd. Thus the Theatre, the Curtain Theatre and later the Rose, the Swan, the Globe and the Fortune had overtaken the provinces. These happenings marked a break with the past though not many good plays were performed from 1576 to 1584. Then the audiences saw such masterpieces like Marlowe's TAMBURLAINE and THE SPANISH TRAGEDY by Kyd.
The THEATRE and the CURTAIN THEATRE north of the city belonged to a carpenter by trade, James Burbage on the opposite side of Thames and west of Southward the Rose Theatre was constructed by Philip Henslowe. Following the footstep of Henslowe, a goldsmith named Francis Langley built the SWAN in 1595. Because the theatre was without a resident company, found it difficult to compete with the Chamberlain's Men, was forced to close down after a July performance in 1597.
Subsequently, James Burbage ran into difficulties attempting to renew the ground lease of the THEATRE in 1596. Cry as hard as he did, the negotiations yielded no solution and James died leaving his son Cuthbert to resolve the problem.
Young Burbage moved fast acted with daring, full of imagination on the face of the lease due to expire at the end of the year which was the 28th December 1598 and had the building dismantled by a carpenter named peter Street along with twelve workmen.
It was dismantled to a piece of land on the opposite side of Thames in Southwark, not much of a distance from the Rose. It took them only eight months to build the Globe, the best tribute to Shakespeare. A new type of association was founded between the owner of the land, Sir Nicholas Brend and the two Burbage brothers, Cuthbert and Richard along with five players from the Chamberlaine's Company. One of these was Shakespeare; in other words, he became a owner of a share in the property.
In the following year the Globe suffered from competition by the new theatre with Philip Henslowe moving across to Thames to build The FORTUNE.
All theatres were destroyed because they were used for animal fights along with theatrical performance in 1642 and 1644 under the order of parliament. One thing the audience disapproved was bear-baiting, The bear was tethered to a stake in the ring into which dogs were released for the for the attack. A bear killed a number of dogs before being killed himself occasionally, falling prey to their jaws. Animal cruelty was not an accepted form of entertainment even in that era and we can presume that the great playwright was one who was guilty of this torture of the innocence. He was guilty in letting the audience of the original Globe' s cockpit sit in a circle and place bets watching the feathered combat which amounted to cockfighting. According to reliable source, the cockfighting would continue from four to five hours. It became so famous, the COCKPIT was also the name of a private theatre in Drury Lane. Rightfully, the Government banned such acts and all theatres were destroyed under the order of Parliament.
Brilliant career
Shame for Shakespeare to have made money in acts such as these; a dot in his brilliant career.
Yet, the Bard cast his wondrous image then and now when every generation recreates Shakespeare in its own image as what one age see as his supreme merit, others ignore who look for something very different. It is a measure of the extraordinary complexity of Shakespeare's genius that uniquely among great writers, he can survive this treatment.
In a classical approach to Shakespeare during the 17th century and for most of the 18th century, criticism of the Bard tended to focus on his university...... his understanding of every human being and ability to express every kind of emotion. For the writers of classicism in their origin, he was an untaught child of nature who appeared to have produced masterpieces almost without knowing it.
To start with Shakespeare was a Man of all modern and perhaps Ancient Poets, apart from his classical knowledge and had the largest and comprehensive soul. I am right when I say all the images of Nature were still present in him and drew them effortlessly with luck. When he describe anything you may not see it but feel it with intensity. If he wanted to wallow with nature, he never needed glasses to read about them. He saw them everywhere. That was Shakespeare the genius who among his tragedies, comedies, histories etc; mixed them in their genre, never overlapping the essence found in their folds. He wrote only one play for children MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM and never classified them into groups. He could not because some were tragic-comodies. The all pure comedy had TAMING OF THE SHREW, The COMEDY OF ERRORS, The MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR.
What I saw at the Globe of Romeo and Juliet is not what I had studied because with time the events in this tragedy are driven forward by the incomprehension of the older generation for the young. As with the world every thing change including the way one looks at Shakespeare. Robert Wagner once said after naming the tragedy as LIEBESTOD to the myth which is the story of Romeo and Juliet. These two young Lovers face insurmountable obstacles with defiance. The narrative format and psychological events are misunderstood that finally lead them to suicide. Romeo and Juliet simulates the experience of adolescence, the intense and changing passions which often generate defiance against the adult world. Though the play rose to heights unimaginable, it was not well received by some great people who saw Shakespeare in the negative. Over the years the drama focuses on this kind of misunderstanding as I did at the Globe when I saw a play that would have stunned and surprised Shakespeare had be lived to see it with his precious Romeo, a black Romeo.
What some of the great people have to say of the Bard
GEORGE BERNARD SHAW
Like Tolstoy, Shaw was irritated by the uncritical adulation given to Shakespeare whom he considered in comparison with such writers as Henrik Ibsen and himself, to be lacking in
ideas and depressingly bourgeois in his attitude to social questions.
LEO TOLSTOY
His objections to Shakespeare was unnatural, but mainly that he had no significant moral message. 'I remember the astonishment I felt when I first read Shakespeare. I expected to receive a powerful aesthetic pleasure but having read one after the other especially Romeo and Juliet not only did I feel no delight but I felt an irresistible repulsion and tedium'......
LETTER TO THE ACADEMIE
There have always been those who thought Shakespeare was overrated. Ironically, these critics include many of the greatest minds in European literature.
VOLTAIRE
For Voltaire Shakespeare was a barbarian. He did not deny his talent but was revolted by his
lack of classical decorum.
LETTERS PHLOSOHIQUES, 1733
Shakespeare boasted a strong fruitful genius. He was natural and sublime but had not so much as a single spark of good taste or knew one rule of the drama.
