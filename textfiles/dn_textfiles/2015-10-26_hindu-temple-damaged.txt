Hindu temple damaged

An unidentified person had entered the Kurukkalmadam Sri Krishnan Temple on October 23 night and damaged 13 statues at the temple, a spokesman for the Kaluwanchikudi Police said.
The administrative secretary of the temple who visited the scene around 4.30 a.m. said parts of damaged statues had been strewn near shops situated in the nearby lane. Kaluwanchikudy Police are investigating.
Police said a pilliyar statue removed from a temple in Vakaneri was also found thrown into a scrub jungle recently.
