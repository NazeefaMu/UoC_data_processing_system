It’s that most magical time of the year - A Christmas tribute to my parents

It is indeed that most magical time of the year! I love Christmas, I just love Christmas. Even as I type these words I can feel a tingle going down my spine and I’m smiling to myself, as I look forward to, what is to me the time of the year that is sheer magic and joy (though alas! most people are not that fortunate).
Just last night as I laid on my bed looking out at the night sky and the dragon fruit tree that grows outside our bedroom window, the thought popped into my head ‘Would Santa Claus like to eat dragon fruit?’. Now you may think, that this is a ludicrous thought for someone who will be 59 in three months time, but I personally feel fortunate and privileged that I still believe in Santa Claus and flying reindeer, elves and gnomes, fairies and goblins, witches and wizards and all the magical elements that made up my childhood - thanks to my amazing as well as wonderful parents, who ensured that I had the most perfect childhood ever. As for Christmas, oh my goodness, even now I recall as though it was just yesterday the preparations that went into making Christmas in our home a magical experience and one which is still talked about by my cousins even today.
Growing up in the ‘60s and early ‘70s, we really did not have a lot. Even a loaf of bread was hard to come by and a tin of condensed milk was a luxury. Chocolates were unheard of and my mother had perfected the art of sewing a little girl’s dress and making it look pretty with just a square of fabric, which was literally all you could buy. Toys were hard to come by, but that did not matter in my case as all I wanted were my pets and we had an abundance of them. A moth-eaten teddy, my woolly dog, Lyka whose tail was forever on the verge of falling off and my rag doll, Bashana who was more rag than a doll, accompanied me wherever I went and of course the trail of dogs, cats and monkeys, hence the lack of toys did not really matter.
By the end of August, my mother would have this grim look on her face and my father would say “Your mother is starting to plan Christmas” and sure enough she was.
In those days, everything was made at home, nothing was bought. At least in our home, that was the case. Ham, corned beef, corned mutton, corned tongue (all of which I’m ashamed to say I enjoyed at that time), stuffed dates and olives, Christmas biscuits, the Dutch and Portuguese sweets like botterletter, bola fiado, pofferjee, fugeti candied cadjunuts, Marzipan, potato toffee, coconut Rock, Cashew toffee, marshmellows, butterscotch sweets, boiled sweets in a myriad different colours, Christmas cakes and puddings, love cakes, breudher - my mother’s recipe was for 1 kg of flour, you have to put 2 kg of butter, 2 kg of sugar and 50 egg yolks! I make this every year and everyone relishes it.
Christmas cake was mixed not in a bowl but in a baby bathtub as mummy would prepare the cake for everyone, including friends and family. Similarly, she made love cakes and all the other goodies. She was all her life a career woman (she worked till she was past 70), I really don’t know how she had time and energy to do what she did. Her nutty fruity stuffing for the chicken and turkey is what I make every year and to date, I haven’t tasted anything better than that. Fruit slices, baked alaska, snowman pudding (again something I have never tasted outside our home); mummy would even make the snowman’s hat, scarf and pipe by hand, ably assisted by my dad who remained a child at heart until his death.
Asparagus curry was prepared with scraped Murunga and cheese. The cheese was made at home, so was ice cream, sorbets and popsicles. Jelly was set in orange skins and oh! what a colourful sight those were. By September, after my mummy had prepared her famous lists, we would set off to the Latheefia Stores to buy all cake and pudding ingredients. My sister Tara would fastidiously shudder at the thought and would never accompany us.
Pettah and especially Gas Works street back in the ‘60s and ‘70s were simply a mess! Mummy would hitch her sari up so as not to tread on the muck all over. There was no proper drainage at that time and garbage, litter and the god know what else was just out on the road. No proper pavements either. We would arrive at the Latheefia Stores, my dad with a resigned look on his face, me all excited and hopping around, sampling everything the storekeeper gave me. My mum was treated with deference and awe. We were served tea and her order duly taken. “Mrs. David please come back in 2 hours and everything will be ready” she would be told. “Now no mistakes please, make sure everything is there” my mother would say (as though anyone would dare make a mistake with mummy), and off we would go for our other businesses and return to collect the ingredients, which were all beautifully packed and checked.
When it came to mixing the cake, everyone including our servants had to stir and make a wish. Once the fruits were mixed, it would be kept covered until the time reached for it to be baked. Similarly, we prepared the love cake and Christmas pudding.
Next, it was the time for Christmas cards. This too was a luxury. The UNICEF cards or any other Christmas card were hard to come by so what did we do? We made them of course. What a wonderful time we had. Coloured crayons, pencils, chocolate wrappers, glazed papers, crepe papers, all went into our Christmas cards which were indeed a sight to behold. Daddy was very artistic and would make the most gorgeous Christmas cards. In one year, my best friend Yamuna Dissanayake’s dad went overseas on a business trip and he brought a set of 24 coloured felt pens - riches indeed. Yamuna promptly brought them our home and told my dad “Uncle Raj, let’s make Christmas cards”. At this point, I have to mention the fact that my dad was a magnet as far as children, animals and beggars were concerned. They all just flocked about him, so that my mum made sure that he had no extra money except one rupee for his cigarettes. “ If your father has some money with him, it will be definitely given to the first person who spins him a hard-luck story and more so at Christmas time,” she said. I still experience the thrill of making those Christmas cards, especially once the felt pens came along. Once, my sister Tara took one look at my attempts and told my father “Surely you are not going to let her send those off”, to which my father replied, “Of course, they are beautiful”. Now till today, I clearly remember those Christmas cards and they were downright hideous.
I could never draw or paint and my highest mark for Arts was 13, nevertheless, my father found them beautiful and they were mailed out to all our friends here and abroad.
Next, it was the time for Christmas shopping. Oh! the excitement and wondering of what to wear for this great outing as it always included a lunch at the Harbour Room and tea at the Pagodas. Mummy had somehow got me a pair of lace pantyhose and of course, I had to wear them for this all-important occasion. In those days, I never walked, I either ran or skipped and jumped up and down when excited. In fact, I still jump up and down when I am excited! After a few hectic hours of shopping, lunch at the Harbour Room where staple fare was lobster thermidor (I still recall it is an amazing taste) and tea at the Pagoda, where I had my fill of delicious curry puffs and cheese cake and other delicacies, we would go home, our car overflowing with our purchases.
Then came that long-awaited day - Christmas Eve. I still experience the excitement of that wonderful day and all the preparations we made. I had to have a new nightdress or pyjamas and even new hair ribbons, as Santa could not see me in last year’s nightdress. No way! Even Bashana was cleaned up for the occasion and had mummy’s lipstick smeared on her for good measure. Teddy and Lyka had new neck ribbons and so did the dogs and cats. A feast was set out for Santa as he would be hungry travelling the world distributing presents. Christmas and love cakes, sweets, biscuits, little sausage rolls (again made by mummy) and of course milk wine and ginger beer were all laid out for him.
On Christmas Eve, our first ritual was to attend the Methodist Church carol service and then dinner at my parents’ best friend’s home, Aunty Wivi and Uncle Nis. Aunty Wivi being a Chinese, dinner was always exotic and unusual and one we all looked forward to. After eating until the bursting point, playing games and singing Christmas carols, we would set off home to get ready for that all-important visitor Santa Claus! On tucking me into the bed, my mother would present me that most precious and unusual gifts. A Marzipan Christmas tree, which was decorated with multicoloured Marzipan baubles(all handmade by her), was in its own little Marzipan pot. Even while writing this, my eyes are filled with tears. How she had the time to do this, I don’t know. Love and care that went into a marvellous work of art is unimaginable.
All through Christmas, this tree would be by my bedside table along with my Noddy lamp, Bashana, Teddy, Lyka and of course the dogs and cats who made it to my bedroom, along with myself would partake of it. I would try hard to keep awake to meet Santa but of course, that never happened. Next morning I would bounce out of bed; Joy to the World and Hark! the Herald Angels song would be blaring out. After all the hugs and kisses and general pandemonium with dogs and cats and budgies joining in the excitement, the first thing was to check if Santa had eaten the goodies laid out for him and of course he had. Next was a trip to the kitchen to wish the home staff and give them their presents. Next, I rush back and go into the garden to check Santa’s toadstools. Oh! what wonderful toadstools they were; in myriad colours, with stars and stripes and polka dots.
Years later, actually just before my mum died in 2005, it had rained the previous night and there were some white toadstools that had sprung up. I asked my mum why it was that we no longer saw toadstools in our garden when I was a child. Has it destroyed? My mother looked at me strangely and said “You mean you never knew? Your father would go out in the early morning and paint them for you!”. I was amazed, speechless and overcome with love for my wonderful father who did everything he could do to ensure that magic was part and parcel of his daughter’s daily life. Breakfast around the table was a family affair (actually in those days every meal was a family affair). Fried bread, bacon and eggs, sausages, fried tomatoes, potatoes, mushrooms, milk rice, plantains, Christmas cakes and puddings, love cake, etc. were all laid out on the breakfast table. Then, off we go to church and lustily sing all the Christmas carols, kiss everyone and wish them after the service and the trot back home for a non-traditional Indian lunch of Biriyani, made by my daddy! Then, I would go through all my presents, my sister would talk to her boyfriends while my energetic mother who was never ever got tired - she didn’t know the meaning of the word, was adding the final touches to the gargantuan Christmas dinner.
We would all be dressed up by 7 pm and ready to welcome the family. All my mother’s sisters, her brother and my cousins would troop in and oh! what a wonderful time we had. Daddy and Uncle Paul would dress up in fancy dresses and keep everyone amused with their antics. We would all perform skits, children would sing for the adults, pull bonbons (there were no televisions, notepads, CDs or any gadgetry that is so much a part of a child’s life today), and of course, partake of all the delicacies my mum had prepared.
The dining table and sideboards literally groaned with food. My dad would always have a glass of wine with the home staff who would join in all the festivities, including the lighting of fireworks. Once the presents were opened and the oohs and ahs were made, we all had to articulate what we wanted to do in the new year - grownups included! My father would be told by one and all to diet and cut out sweets, my mother would be told to work less, I would be told to eat more (My mum would dress me up daily in a way that I would look plump) and so it would go on amidst much fun and laughter. I would unfailingly ask if I could wear makeup and pluck my eyebrows only to be told a very firm NO (even at age 8 I loved makeup and pretty dresses even though in those days they were hard to come by). Soon after midnight, everyone would leave replete with good food and laden with gifts. My mum and the staff would put away the leftover food, leaving the cleaning up for the next day. I would be on the bed next to my Marzipan tree, surrounded by my presents and wondering, just wondering would Santa Claus by any chance make another visit? I believed in Santa till I was almost 15, and my parents encouraged it, till the day I opened my mum’s wardrobe and discovered all the contents of my letter to Santa in there. The penny dropped and oh! how I wept and wept and wept. My childhood dreams shattered. However, I bounced back and demanded that I be given Santa Claus nonetheless. And my parents complied.
The years have gone by, my wonderful, amazing parents, Priscilla(Senaratne) and Raj David-are no more, but the magic they created still lives on in the hearts and minds of my sister Tara and myself and my cousins as well. I still believe in fairies and Santa Claus and have not given up hope that one day soon I will spy them in my garden and racing through the night sky. Christmas carols blare out from the October 1, right through January. I try and produce as many of my mother’s Christmas goodies as possible. When I feel tired, I tell myself that I am a working woman and all this is too much for me, a little voice inside my head says ‘Your mother was a working woman too, she sewed and cooked for her children and her extended family and neighbours’. I still jump up and down when excited and skip through the house and while shopping. I believe in magic and miracles and trying to help as many people and animals as possibly I can. In my beloved father’s words ‘I will not pass this way again’. As a tiny tot I was puzzled and told him ‘but Daddy you pass this way all the time’. He explained what this actually meant and admonished me never to pass by anyone who needed help!
Christmas at home was all about love, caring, sharing, magic and wonder. After all these years, I still believe in Magic. Happy Christmas everyone and I thank my parents for their amazing legacy. You will always live on in my heart and in my mind.
