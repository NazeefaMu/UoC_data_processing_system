Ban on players lifted pending outcome of appeal

Sri Lanka Cricket yesterday confirmed that on the recommendation of the Appeal Committee appointed to look into the appeals made by the players of the Panadura SC and Kalutara PCC following their suspension from cricket activities for being found to have not upheld the spirit of the game, the accused players would be permitted to engage in domestic cricket activities pending the outcome of their appeal.
The committee headed by president of the Schools Cricket Association Oshara Panditharathne, informed the Executive Committee of SLC that they would require more time to conduct a comprehensive inquiry, and recommended a temporary lifting of the cricket suspensions imposed on the players pending the completion of a full inquiry by the Appeal Board.
