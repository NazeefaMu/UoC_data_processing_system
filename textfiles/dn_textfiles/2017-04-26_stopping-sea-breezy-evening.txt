STOPPING BY THE SEA ON A BREEZY EVENING

Serendipity is carved in my disposition. Yet, my twilight stroll along the promenade quite parallel to the Matara road in the city of Galle on that absorbing evening was unpremeditated. My sedentary job always compels me to give a rest to my thinking faculty. In order to recharge my batteries, as my colleagues always crack a joke to me saying that I look pale, I dared to have a long stroll.
The sun was like a fire ball in the evening sky. It was steadily falling into the blue sea, the fantastic scene was that it was sandwiched between the horizon and the vault of the heaven. The evening panorama with the Dutch fortress in the backdrop , the giant clock tower standing as a sentinel quite visible to the whole city and the natural Galle harbor at sight with the nestling light house at the far end of the beach edifying its presence made my evening a memory play of my youthful escapades with rebellious friends.
Professor Ludowyke’s ‘Good Evenings’ opened before me. Ludowyke of peradeniya DRAMSOC fame is synonymous with English education in Galle. His stellar pedagogic life began at Richmond, Galle. Nora Roberts’s ‘Galle As Quite As Asleep’ came alive to me. Yet, the quite discernible truth to me is the terrible fact that the younger generation is alien to the rich legacy they have endowed to us in their service to mankind. The one time librarian of the Galle Fort Library, the late Nora Roberts deserves our encomium for writing the true history of Galle and its iconic precincts for us to cherish with pristine pride. Even a posthumous appreciation of their immeasurable services is imperative. The relevant authorities should wake up from their slumber to answer the need of the hour. We have to show that Gallians are grateful.
While I was lost in a reverie, all of a sudden, I was surrounded by an immaculately white clad bevy of school goers. Their presence brought me to the senses. They are some of my students, all of them have a penchant for reading in general and reading good books of literature in particular. Little cute girl Peshani, buxom Chamika, slim look Gayashi, forever chrysanthemum Isuri , ever smiling Mulmi, sprint quuen Prathibani, quite energetic and imaginative Samadhi, angelic Thathsarani, good speller Aparna, oceanic Sayuri, collected Dirukshi, pet loving Vinuri, Rameshi with her peculiar smile and hard working Nethmi Dias were them. They had been killing the time munching gram on the nearby kerb till their parents come to collect them after their evening classes for extra guidance in French. In chorus they said that they had been hunting for me to ask for some books for holiday reading. I, myself, as an avid reader had a whale of a chance to guide them for good read. I didn’t have the foggiest idea of meeting them, there.
They have been my apples of the eye since they came to learn literature from me. Their taste of reading and their dispositions are quite palpable to me and so I broke the ice to play the devil’s advocate on good reading during their holidays. Reading is a good holiday job for the children. As they are always immersed in text related reading, I didn’t want to make their holidays a busman’s holiday.
Peshani’s shrieking voice penetrated into my very heart’s core. She insisted me to recommend a good read related to French. My first choice was ‘Le Misarab le’ by Victor Hugo. My first reading of this great master piece by the iconic writer fired my imagination. ‘Sir, I have already read it.I will be rereading it after my A/L. once again.’ It was Aparna’s voice.
Chamika is a student with a different taste. She wanted to go deeper into rural Sri Lanka. Grass For My Feet by J. Vijayatunga came to my mind almost effortlessly.
Nethmi Dias , who is the bookworm among them suggested Village in the Jungle by Leonard Woolf, one time government agent in Hambanthota who had a soft spot for the innocent people there, Silindu still lives in our hearts. All of them showered Nethmi with praise for her witty choice.
