Kirivehera Chief Monk airlifted to Colombo

The Chief Incumbent of the Kataragama Kirivehera Rajamaha Viharaya Ven. Kobawaka Damminda Thera who was shot by unidentified gunmen on Tuesday night (12), was airlifted for further treatment to a private hospital yesterday.
Ven. Damminda Thera and the other monk who sustained injuries were treated at the Hambantota General Hospital.
The chief monk had been shot at the temple premises around 10.50 on Tuesday night, when three gunmen lying in wait at the Pahala Maluwa had opened fire, initial investigations revealed.
The monks were rushed to the Kataragama Hospital with gunshot wounds and later transferred to the Hambantota Base Hospital for further treatment.
Ven. Damminda Thera, who was shot in the abdomen, was initially treated in the ICU. Investigations are being carried out by several teams of the Kataragama Police and the Tangalle Crimes Investigation Unit under the supervision of the Tangalle SP.
Police have found the jeep used by the suspects to flee, on the same night. Police spokesman SP Ruwan Gunasekara said the suspects would be arrested shortly based on several leads.
