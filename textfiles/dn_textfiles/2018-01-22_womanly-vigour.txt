Womanly vigour

Retired Army Major Ramani Kangaraarachchi can be called a woman of many talents - talents which are unique from one another. Kangaraarachchi was one of the six women to have joined the Sri Lanka Army’s Women’s Corps at its inception in 1979.
Childhood dream
It had been Kangaraarachchi’s childhood dream to join the forces, a somewhat unusual dream for a young girl at that time. After completing her academic years in school, armed with a diploma in business management, she joined the Sri Lanka Army as a cadet officer and after training was commissioned as a second lieutenant.
“In the 1980 I saw an advertisement in the papers calling for applications to join the Army Women’s Corps which was unheard of because at the time there were no women in the forces and I did not believe my childhood dream to be in the military would become a reality.
I was so happy and thought it was meant for me, so, I applied and got selected to join the Sri Lanka Army after three interviews which was a major turning point in my life until I was married,” she recalled.
“Five other girls along with me were the very first recruits to the Army’s Women’s Corps,” she said. She has also been a part of the first women’s group to receive military training at Women’s Royal Army School in Camberly.
“It is attached to the prestigious Sandhurst Military Academy in the UK and we received training for nine months,” she added.

Of course life in military is not a bed of roses. It is far more than being a career woman working in an air conditioned room in front of a computer. “Life in the army teaches you a lot. These experiences can be life changing. It teaches you to work hard and teaches you to be part of a team, but most of all it teaches the discipline in life which is invaluable,” said Kangaraarachchi.
In her view the qualifications you earn in military are priceless. “You are a part of an adventure when you are in army at the same time gives you the chance to work in situations where no other organisation can offer.
It’s considered a man’s job so women have to keep up with their male counterparts.Young women aspiring fora military careeryou have to keep in mind it’s all about hard work and sacrifices.
Army makes one a highly trained expert and you can achieve a lot. The army is not the place for people who just want a job. You have to be willing to make the sacrifices if you are in the forces,” she said.
After 15 years of service, in 1995, Ramani retired as a Major in the army and made history as the first officer to retire in the Army’s Women’s Corps. During her last five years in the service she gained the position of the second in command of the regiment.
Inspiration for women
“Having been part of the pioneer women’s group, I got the chance to pave the way for others. Even after my retirement, I did not stop being involved in army,” she said.
Kangaraarachchi is the founder President of Ex-Army Women’s Association and served in the post for eight years. She still continues to inspire, uplift and empower women who are a part of the association.
“These women have been in a military setup. They feel lonely and stranded once they are in society. So, through the association we help them to settle in civil setup. We assist them to find jobs or to be self-employed. We help in the education of their children. We uplift their lives spiritually as well,” she said.
For her services she was recognized and awarded a service medal by Speaker Karu Jayasuirya at the remembrance parade recently. Having served women from all walks of life Kangaraarachchi has also been an excellent mother of two wonderful children.
“Being a mother serving in the military was a challenging task and some of the challenges were just like any other working mother would have,” Kangaraarachchisaid. “Such challenges were trying to have a work-life balance and the constant feeling of not being devoted enough towards the children.
Even though women’s corps was not deployed for longer durations in Sri Lanka during the 80’s, there were instances I had to leave the children behind and go outstation for various duties.
I used to have mixed feelings during those instances; the duty to serve the country over powers the guilt of having left the children under the care of maids or vice versa. Since then I have come a long way,” she explained.
On a spiritual path
At the moment Kangaraarachchi is in a different battle trying to conquer spirituality that is more needed in one’s life. “At present I am content with my journey, however, the experiences I gained throughout the years made me realize the importance of improving one’s spirituality to lead a quality life. From past few years I was able to conduct several spiritual programmes through my initiative with Viruliya Sevana, engaging the Ex service women. As I have celebrated my 60th birthday last year, it is my wish to continue being in this path until the later part of my life,” she concluded.
