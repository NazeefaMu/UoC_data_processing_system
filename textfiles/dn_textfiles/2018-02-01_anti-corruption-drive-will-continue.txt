Anti-corruption drive will continue

President Maithripala Sirisena said that he will in future continue on a correct political vision no matter what obstacles he would have to face, and carry out his duty as President for the betterment of its people.
He said that when he initiates action against corruption and the corrupt for the betterment of the people, these parties band into one camp and attack him.
The President noted that he would not hesitate to take action against such corrupt figures without any consideration as to which party they belonged to, as he had faith in the people.
The President made this comment at a special media briefing for the Dinamina, held at his official residence yesterday.
He noted that he stepped out of the party he was in earlier, due to its corrupt nature. But having formed a new alliance, if there was corruption there too, he would certainly not accept it as a policy. After the end of the long drawn war, the people expected a free and fair administration in this country. But instead, incidents of killings, abductions including journalists, burning and vandalising media institutions and such destructive acts became rampant in the country.
However, the President pointed out that despite the criticism levelled at this government, people today have the opportunity to live peacefully without fear.
However, he said, if anyone is behaving in a manner that is not acceptable to the people, he would not hesitate to act in fulfilling his pledge to the people.
President Sirisena noted that although the debate on the Bond report and the Presidential Commission to Investigate Serious Acts of Fraud, Corruption and Abuse of Power, State Resources and Privileges (PRECIFAC) is scheduled to take place in Parliament prior to the election based on his challenge, its success could be guaranteed as technical and legal measures have to be presented.
Expressing his views on the delay in legal action against the Rajapaksas on corruption during the previous tenure, he said the current government is responsible for the delay of these legal measures. He said although the consensus government was in favour of initiating such legal action, the UNP should be held responsible for the delay.
The President pointed out that in the upcoming LG elections, if he is made weak, he would not be able to implement measures that the people entrusted on him to do and said he would only be able to implement these measures, if he was given the power by the people and as such the SLFP and the UPFA should be made victorious.
He said the next two years would be more crucial than the past three years and expressed his desire to forge ahead after the February LG 10 polls together with clean and corruption free politicians irrespective of their party or colour.
