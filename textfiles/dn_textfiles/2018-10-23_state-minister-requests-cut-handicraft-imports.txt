State Minister requests cut-off of handicraft imports

State Tourism Development and Christian Religious Affairs Minister Ranjith Aluvihare said he had sent a written request to President Maithripala Sirisena asking him to discontinue the importation of handicrafts.
It was to help develop the country’s handicrafts industry, he added.
The state minister was addressing a crowd at the inauguration ceremony of a handicrafts village at Ehalagala in Sigirya. Craftsmen and women were provided with equipment during the event.
The Central Cultural Fund earned nearly Rs.15 to 20 million annually from tourists who visit Sigiriya, but no funds had so far been set aside to develop the surrounding areas or to aid the handicrafts sector, State Minister Aluvihare said. Sigiriya Maha Vihara Chief Incumbent Ven. Pubbiliye Dammananda Thera also participated in the event.
