Clifford Cup k/o rugby: Havies have the edge over Police

The game between Police Sports Club and Havelock Sports Club will be a closely fought out battle for supremacy at the Racecourse grounds, Reid Avenue in their Dialog ‘A’ Division inter-club Clifford Cup knockout rugby quarter finals today at 4:15pm.
The Havelock’s who have faced an unexpected plight losing some of their key players yet recovering from injuries are bound to field a couple of sidelined big names.
However adding to their woes would be the absence of their play maker and full back Dulaj Perera due to a serious knee injury occurred while playing against Kandy SC in their second round game.
On the other hand the unpredictable Police lads, who nearly turned tables on CR & FC losing 22-23 will have to come up with a similar performance if they hope to overcome the Havelock’s with a victory.
Havies skipper and prop forward Dushmantha Priyadarshana “Bodhi” faces another acid test while the Police SC skipper Udara Sooriyapperuma has fared admirably well with the resurgent force.
