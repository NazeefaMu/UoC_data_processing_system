SRI LANKA - FAILED AS A NATION

Where have we gone wrong?
Lessons to learn for the future
“Fine, we got rid of the British to rule ourselves. But are we actually leading a good life and have we set up the governance as we expected or imagined”, questioned Prof Rajeev Bhargava.
Seventy years is too long a period to get something right. And yet Sri Lanka has been struggling for the last 70 years to get it right.
The Bandaranaike Centre for International Studies (BCIS) recently held a discussion on “1948 Independence - what then and now for Sri Lanka and South Asia”, to look at where exactly we have gone wrong and what lessons we can learn for the future.
A panel of Indian and Sri Lankan academics asked the question of whether Sri Lanka still remained as one of Asia’s most promising new countries as it was post 1948 or whether that hope has all but faded away.They looked back at the various opportunities that were forgone during the last 70 years whilst making an attempt to explain the way forward for Sri Lanka.
Director of BCIS, Dr HarindaVithanage delivering the opening remarks at the event said that there is always an ‘idea of India’ but there was never an ‘idea of Sri Lanka’ and added that while celebrating the 70th anniversary, Sri Lankans now needed to think of what Sri Lanka means to them.
He explained that, there were three things that are pushing Sri Lanka to create an “Idea of Sri Lanka”, they are; People, Politics and Position.
This revolved around how people would look at the future of Sri Lanka, how the politics should evolve or transform for a better change and finally the position of Sri Lanka - the security and the way forward, he said.
Concerns of a former leader
Participating at the event as the Chairperson of the Bandaranaike National Memorial Foundation (BNMF), Former President Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumarathunga said she doubted whether the country was pedalling backwards and questioned whether the leaders achieved the dreams of Sri Lanka as a nation.
She pointed out that the dreams the leaders had when Sri Lanka received independence were not unattainable ones.
“Sometime after the independence, we lost the main picture. It would be useful to reflect on that at this important juncture of history”, she said.
“Having built a stable democratic nation, we have not succeeded in forming a united State”, she said, speaking about the failure of bringing together different communities under a common goal.
“Three years ago, we were once again given the chance to rebuild, similar to what we had after Independence” she said and called it a miracle in the political platform of Sri Lanka.
For the first time in history, the whole country got together to voice their opinion against one person and a ruthless regime. Two major political parties came together effectively with a clear vision to achieve what was required at the time and to implement good governance.
Even though the country had every possibility of achieving success according to the Former President, she said “The question that remains is did we make use of that astonishing opportunity the country got three years before?”.
She ended her speech stating that it was the most difficult and complicated question that we, as Sri Lankans, at this moment need to find answers for.
South Asia Post Independence
Speaking under the topic, Shaping of South Asia through Independence, the Director, Institute of Indian Thought, Centre for the Study of Developing Societies (CSDS), Delhi Prof Rajeev Bhargava said South Asians suffered from cultural subjugation due to their ignorance about their own traditions and religion.
Prof Bhargava explained that freedom is when someone is free from authoritative constraints - free from political, legal, mental and intellectual constraints.
He questioned the purpose of having freedom if one cannot live a life of his own choice. In the meantime, he said that the definition of freedom during pre-Independence was different to that of now.
“Freedom then was to get rid of colonial rulers, to be free from colonial constraints - to develop in our own distinctive way and that’s what freedom meant at that time”, he said.
Prof Bhargava said that both Indians and Sri Lankans were successful in getting rid of British rule and they aspired to restore their culture and democratic rule.
“Fine, we got rid of the British to rule ourselves. But are we actually leading a good life and have we set up the governance as we expected or imagined”, he questioned.
He said in terms of India - the answer cannot be yes, “In some aspects we have achieved but there is a long way to go”.
Prof Bhargava opined that we, as South Asians tend to lapse into a political culture that we have inherited from the past which is not democratic - one of the aspects that distracted the country from moving smoothly along the direction towards democracy.
That is when he highlighted the need for leaders with the clear mind who would understand the situation of the citizens and who would make sure that they are leading a peaceful life.
“We need smart leaders who could see and act better. Those who could stand in the shoes of the most vulnerable”, he added.
He said that people are also accustomed to be ruled by powerful men (depending on which caste and tribe he belongs to) and have forgotten the concept of self-rule. As a result, cultural India is with Cultural Chief Ministers and Cultural Prime Ministers.
“We need to be free from certain intellectual concepts in order to be truly free. This is happening particularly after political independence (after 1950’s especially), the country is running after intellectual colonialism”, he said.
Prof Bhargava was with the opinion that conceptual ideas and concepts do not sit very well with the cultural heritage as he observed the swing from hyper westernization on one hand to cultural and traditional practices on the other.
According to him, one of the problems that South Asians need to tackle is their tendency of trying to become second hand Europeans or Second hand Americans.
“We are still living in a cultural environment as second hand Europeans and some others as second hand Sri Lankans or second hand Buddhists”, he said.
Contemporary Scenarios
After Independence - Sri Lanka was getting kudos as a third world country - blessed with universal adult franchise, our GDP was comparatively high and the economy opened up before many other neighbouring countries, said Former Foreign Secretary H. M. G. S. Palihakkara.
But somewhere down the road, the country faulted whilst other more smaller and larger have overtaken Sri Lanka.
“History then and now is compiled of few successes and several failures on part to implement democracy and practice democracy”, he noted.
Speaking of peace as a country and as well as a region, he questioned whether we were truly at peace.
“Are we at peace now? - As a country and as a region - new nuclear dimensions have been added to our regions - they are one of our concerns. It’s already a conflict prone region, there is a need to worry about the South Asian security scenario. After Independence, two South Asian countries have become nuclear powers”, he said.
One of Palihakkara’s concerns was that there was no structure or a regional forum to discuss and negotiate problems or mitigate rising issues.
He further explained that that there was a significant shift between then and now - things considered inclusively domestic are not domestic anymore, they have become matters of external scrutiny.
“The Maldivian issue, Sri Lanka’s military action and Nepal’s domestic affairs are before the United Nations Security Council – this was not the situation before Independence. At present, globalization, connectivity, civil society activism, diaspora and externalization have a lot to do with the leadership of these countries”, said Palihakkara.
Lacking a shared idea of Sri Lanka
Emeritus Professor, University of Colombo Prof Jayadeva Uyangoda echoing Dr Vithanage said, when speaking of the Socio - political Transformations in Sri Lanka with reflections on South Asian cases, that we as Sri Lankans never had an articulated and shared idea of Sri Lanka.
“Sometime back, a diplomat asked me how the Indian government could help Sri Lanka as the leaders are also in the process of drafting a new Constitution. I said, invite them for three months and make them read the Indian Constitution - that’s the only help the Indian government could do”, he said.
We lost many opportunities every time we drafted a new Constitution - we did not have the foresight to have an idea of Sri Lanka. The idea and vision for Sri Lanka - is constructed on the basis of the past but the Constitution is for the future. The Constitution should embody the normative goals of ideals, added Prof Uyangoda.
In the meantime, Prof Uyangoda said, democracy has not been able to penetrate deep in Sri Lanka and it always revolved around civil society groups and political parties.
Foreign Policy challenges ahead
Deputy Director, Bandaranaike Centre for International Studies (BCIS) George I. H. Cooke began his presentation stating that making the island a hub is not a new policy but one which needs to be revived and revisited.
To which he explained, “numerous calls were made to make Sri Lanka a hub in the Indian Ocean, but often we fail to realize that Sri Lanka was a hub of strategic importance. Traders from China, the Arab world, as well as the Portuguese, Dutch and British found the island to be of importance and some sought to exert influence and control it to their benefit at various periods”.
Cooke pointed out that it is time to look at the past, understand the current and plan for the future.
“In our context, emphasis on research into how Sri Lanka strode the global stage, the measures undertaken, the international developments at the time, the tight balancing act that the country had to follow, all become relevant as the country celebrates its 70th anniversary of independence”, he said.
According to Cooke, today Sri Lanka is a member, dialogue partner and observer of numerous organizations and groupings, yet the amount of leverage the country enjoys internationally, as a result of such affiliations, leaves much to be desired and he added that it is time the country surges ahead, but it would only be able to do so with a policy of pragmatic strategizing, which it tends to lack at the most crucial of times.
Cooke, thus observed that identifying national interest was at the center of decision making and that whether in negotiations over bilateral issues, staking a claim at the United Nations or through the plethora of multilateral platforms that Sri Lanka sits at, the prospect of going in with an agenda for success, rather than merely marking attendance, needed to be at the top of list of priorities.
“Security remains critical, from defence of the island from outside interference; cyber attacks; protecting maritime boundaries and resources; preserving peace, law and order within the island; ensuring a healthy population; securing sufficient food; avoiding economic downturns; promoting investment while protecting the environment. All of these dimensions of security are paramount for a country going forward”, he explained.
He further said that the goal of ‘Sri Lanka - First’ irrespective of who or what we are dealing with needs to be a constant in foreign policy formulation.
Cooke noted that the State needed to rethink its objectives – rethink formulation and rethink implementation - in creating a clear, concise and considered course, thus it was prudent for the island to adopt a foreign policy formula.
“If Sri Lanka and her policy makers don’t put the country first, no one else will”, he said almost echoing the main issue around why, we as a nation have failed for the last 70 years.
