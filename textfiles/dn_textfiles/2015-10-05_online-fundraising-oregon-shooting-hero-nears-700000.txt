Online fundraising for Oregon shooting hero nears $700,000

US: An online campaign to pay for the treatment and recovery of an Iraq war veteran hailed as a hero during the Oregon college massacre raised almost $700,000 in just one day, the website showed on Saturday.
Chris Mintz, 30, is credited with likely saving the lives of fellow students when he prevented the 26-year-old gunman fromentering a classroom at Umpqua Community College in Roseburg before police arrived.
The shooter later committed suicide. Mintz, a mixed martial artist and bodybuilder who was studying fitness technology in the hope of becoming a personal trainer, drew fire that left him with seven bullet wounds and two broken legs, his former girlfriend said in an interview.
More than $680,000 was raised from just over 20,000 donors in one day, according to the GoFundMe site set up by Mintz's cousin, Derek Bourgeois. - AFP
