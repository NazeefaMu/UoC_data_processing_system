Wave of influenza in  Southern Province

The wave of influenza that is prevalent throughout the Southern Province is seasonal.
It has been typically witnessed in the last few years between April and June and again from November to January, Southern Province Health Services Director Dr. G. Wijesooriya said.
A bacteria that causes a number of illnesses led to several deaths of children at the Karapitiya Teaching Hospital, Dr. Wijesooriya further said.
The Provincial Health Services Director confirmed that about 15 children under the age of one, from the Galle, Matara and Hambantota districts died at the Galle Hospital.
The Provincial Director also said that the flu spreads from person to person through sneezing, coughing, or touching contaminated surfaces and seasonal influenza viruses can cause mild to severe illness and even death, particularly in some high-risk individuals.
Pregnant women, the very young and very old, immune-compromised people and patients with serious medical conditions such as cancer, diabetes and heart disease are at increased risk for contracting flu.
Dr. Wijesooriya also requested parents not to send their children to school if they have symptoms of flu and to seek medical treatment immediately.
Galle Regional Director of Health Services Dr. T.L.J.C. Siritunga said that the significant increase in hospitalisations at Karapitiya Teaching Hospital was due to patients being transferred from other districts of the province.
He also urged the public to follow the instructions given by the respective health authorities to minimise the progression of influenza into an epidemic.
“We have to wait for the report of the Medical Research Institute to confirm the status of the influenza occurrence at present. In addition to the Teaching Hospital, there is an increase in the number of pediatric influenza patients admitted to the hospitals in Elpitiya Balapitiya and Udugama, Dr. Siritunga said.
When contacted, Matara Regional Health Services Drector Dr. A.D.U. Karunaratne said that there were influenza positive cases reported within the district, out of which number Matara General Hospital registered the highest number of 150 patients, while Kamburupitiya Hospital had admitted 40 patients.
Owing to the better health facilities available at these hospitals, there is an increase of patients admitted to them, he said.
