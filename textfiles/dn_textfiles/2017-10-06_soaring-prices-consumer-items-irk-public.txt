Soaring prices of consumer items irk public

Prices of essential food items have gone up sky-high at the open markets, consumers complain.
The price of a coconut has gone up from Rs. 100 to Rs. 110 and the price of a km of samba and nadu rice varieties has gone up from Rs. 90 to Rs. 100.
A big onion km has gone up to Rs. 100 to Rs. 120 while price of red onions has soared up to Rs. 200 per km.
Prices of local fruit and vegetable varieties have also significantly risen up.
Beans, carrot, beet-root, leeks, capsicum, and chilies all show high prices now as much as Rs. 200 per km. A km of green chilies has gone up to Rs. 400 and a quality tea km has increased over Rs. 1,000.
Consumers urge the Government to look into this pathetic situation and take immediate step to reduce the prices of essential items.
