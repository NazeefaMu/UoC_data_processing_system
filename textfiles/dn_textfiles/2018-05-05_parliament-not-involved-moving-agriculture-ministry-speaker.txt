Parliament not involved in moving Agriculture Ministry - Speaker

The Speaker’s Office releasing a statement yesterday, denied reports that it was Parliament which had directed the Agriculture Ministry be moved from Rajamalwatte to Rajagiriya.
Agriculture Minister Mahinda Amaraweera had previously made the statement that the Agriculture Ministry was moved to a building in Rajagiriya on a rent of Rs 23.5 million a month, from Rajamalwatte due to a request made by Parliament.
In 2015, when the new government came into power, there was no office space for the newly appointed Oversight Committees and the Speaker had directed that the necessary space be built in the garage premises of the ground floor in Parliament.
“But at the time, the government was focused on providing all MPs with office space close to Parliament. And thus with the dual purpose of providing space both to the Oversight Committee and MP offices in the same building, the government made the decision to take over the premises of the Agriculture Ministry for this purpose and to shift the Ministry elsewhere”, the statement read further.
“It was not a decision made by Parliament”. He further noted that there was no proposal made by Parliament to move the Agriculture Ministry in part or in whole from Rajamalwatte and to shift it to a building in Rajagiriya. In keeping with the government’s decision, steps were taken to refurbish the Rajamalwatte building for Parliamentary purposes with labour provided by the Navy and the old equipment was renovated, saving cost on having to spend on new ones.
The Speaker’s office, he further noted under his leadership functioned with utmost transparency and did its best to save on public expenditure.
