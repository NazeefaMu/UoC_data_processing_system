No one can divide country - President

President Maithripala Sirisena says the present government will not allow anyone to divide the country nor will it allow any force to subjugate the people.
“No body will be allowed to divide our country in the future too,” President Sirisena said.
The President also said that the present government has taken steps to protect our War Heroes from any international pressures.
President Sirisena further said that certain politicians rally around Lipton Circus shouting outdated slogans saying not to betray the country and protect the War Heroes, only for the sole purpose of achieving their petty political objectives.
