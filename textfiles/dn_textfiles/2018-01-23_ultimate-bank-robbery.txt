The ultimate bank  robbery

‘Den of Thieves’ is an upcoming American heist action thriller film directed and co-written by Christian Gudegast. The film stars Gerard Butler, Curtis "50 Cent" Jackson, Pablo Schreiber, O'Shea Jackson Jr., Evan Jones, Dawn Olivieri, Mo McRae, and Max Holloway. It follows an elite group of County Sheriff officers who look to stop a crew of thieves that plan to rob the Federal Reserve in Los Angeles.
Den of Thieves is a gritty Los Angeles crime saga which follows the intersecting and often personally connected lives of an elite unit of the LA County Sheriff's Department and the state's most successful bank robbery crew as the outlaws plan a seemingly impossible heist on the Federal Reserve Bank of downtown Los Angeles.
Every day, $120mm in cash is taken out of circulation and destroyed by the Los Angeles Branch of the Federal Reserve - unless a notorious, elite crew of bank robbers can pull off the ultimate heist and get to the money first... right under the noses of LA's most feared division in law enforcement.
If Crime is what you are looking for, you are in for a value-for-money thriller.
