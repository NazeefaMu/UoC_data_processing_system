My hands would tremble on touching Aishwarya -Ranbir

Ranbir Kapoor and Aishwarya Rai Bachchan have been the talk of the town ever since the trailer of ‘Ae Dil Hai Mushkil’ came out. Their chemistry is undeniable. After their steamy Filmfare photoshoot, it is impossible for us to wait for them to slay the big screen together!
In a very recent interview, Ranbir spoke about how he was only in class 10 when he first worked as an assistant director with Aishwarya on the sets of the movie ‘Aa Ab Laut Chale.’ The picture of 16-year-old Ranbir meeting Ash had resurfaced a while ago.
Ranbir said that he was so smitten by Aishwarya’s charm, that for him it was love at first sight. He also says that the first time he ever experienced the pain of heartbreak was definitely because of Ash. He had fallen hard for her.
Ranbir, who has romanced with the most beautiful Bollywood stars ever since he started acting in films, says that he was very shy when he had to do intimate scenes with Aishwarya. It was Aishwarya who made him realise that it’s all the part of an act and as actors it is their responsibility to give it their best shot. That opened up Ranbir, quite a lot. StoryPick
