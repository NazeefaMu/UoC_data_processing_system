This is why I am excited to be partnering with Colonial Motors, a prestigious brand whose own story is intricately entwined with that of Sri Lanka’s automotive history. Now clients of Autobahn will have unfettered access to some of the most advanced equipment handled by the most well trained staff on the island. I look forward to this partnership flourishing in the years to come.”
