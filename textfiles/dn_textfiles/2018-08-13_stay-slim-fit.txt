According to prominent Endocrinologist and Diabotologist Dr. Noel Somasundaram, the impact of being over weight on diabetic patients is significant. One of the important steps to reduce complications of diabetes is to lose weight if one is overweight or obese. Weight loss has multiple benefits. Insulin resistance and resulting inflammation improve when weight is lost and tissue injury that results from inflammation can be reduced. Weight loss also results in improvement of glucose , blood pressure and lipid levels as well as reduce the underlying problems in diabetes such as inflammation, tendency for blood to clot easily resulting in heart attack (pro-coagulation state). Weight loss in early diabetes can even ‘cure’ diabetes. Weight loss also improves quality of life and should be attempted as early as possible.
