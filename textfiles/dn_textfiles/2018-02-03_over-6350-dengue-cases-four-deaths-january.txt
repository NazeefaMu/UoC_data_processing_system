Over 6,350 dengue cases, four deaths in January

A total of 6,353 dengue cases and four deaths had been reported last month (January), the Epidemiology Unit sources said.
According to the sources, the highest number of dengue cases, 1020, had been reported from the Colombo district while the second highest number, 627 had been reported from the Gampaha district.

Meanwhile, medical experts and consultants advise the public to seek medical treatment without delay for any type of fever without applying home remedies.
All fever patients need rest and they should not attend work or school.
All fever patients should take paracetamol only. All other medications, especially Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs (NSAID) such as Ibuprofen cause Dengue Hemorrhagic Fever (DHF), which can become fatal, they said.
