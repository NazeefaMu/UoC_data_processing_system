SAITM students call for direct enrollment in KDU

The Students’ Action Committee of SAITM demands that the government enroll all students who are currently at SAITM in the Kotelawela Defence University (KDU) without performing any selection.
All SAITM students need a permanent and legal solution for the issue and SAITM should not be closed down before solving the issue, Convener of the Committee Shanaka De Saram said.
Addressing a press conference held at the CSR in Colombo yesterday, he said that the committee wishes to thank the President, GMOA and others for coming up with a joint solution and for deciding to enroll SAITM students in KDU. All SAITM students met the required criteria when entering SAITM set by the UGC and Higher Education Ministry.
The committee has sent a letter to the President and all other relevant parties requesting that they come up with the necessary legislative changes before enrolling SAITM students in KDU. No SAITM student should be subjected to any further payment.
No one should influence the Supreme Court judgement to be given for the SAITM issue, De Saram said. Dilshan Sampath, a fourth-year medical student, said that the committee has no conflict with the minimum standards of medical education and it does not matter whether it becomes three B passes (3 Bs) or two C passes (2 Cs) and one S pass.
All SAITM students had been selected to be enrolled in SAITM by the UGC and the Higher Education Ministry after being interviewed individually. Therefore, all of them are qualified.
The committee members said that they had spent 10 years of their youth in SAITM without being able to become qualified and registered doctors in Sri Lanka.
