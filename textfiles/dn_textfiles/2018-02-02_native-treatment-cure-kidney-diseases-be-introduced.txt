Native treatment to cure kidney diseases to be introduced

North Central Provincial Council has decided to introduce native treatment which has been proved to cure kidney patients, including CKDu patients, in all ayurveda hospitals in the Province.
NCP Chief Secretary H.M.P. Bandara said the treatment will be initiated at Medirigiriya Provincial Ayurveda Hospital on February 15.
A group of allopathy and ayurveda doctors headed by Dr. Nishantha Kumarasinghe of Kotelawala Defence University, who pioneered treatment formulated by late Ven. Waharaka Abayarathanalankara Thera, have been practising this particular treatment method at Kebithigollawa ayurveda community health centre for two years.
“We have been appraised by Dr. Kumarasinghe and his colleagues about this ayurveda treatment for kidney patients which seems highly successful. I, along with provincial Health Secretary Saman Bandulsena, Provincial Ayurveda Commissioner Dr. Kumara Alwis and others, decided to expand the programme to all ayurveda hospitals in NCP.” Following the Medirigiriya clinic, it is intended to open similar treatment units at Kabithigollawa, Medawachchiya, Rambawa and Padaviya, as well as at Anuradhapura ayurveda general hospital, Bandara said.
He said that the Presidential task force for the prevention of kidney diseases has pledged full support and patronage to promote this programme. According to Ashela Iddhawala, head of the task force, President Maithripala Sirisena has instructed that this treatment be introduced countrywide. Initially a sum of Rs. 2.5 million would be allocated to the provincial ayurveda commissioner for the first phase of the expansion programme.
