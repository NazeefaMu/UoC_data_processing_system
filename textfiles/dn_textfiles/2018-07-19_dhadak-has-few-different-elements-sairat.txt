'Dhadak' has few different  elements from   'Sairat'

Janhvi Kapoor and Ishaan Khatter’s ‘Dhadak’, which releases this Friday, is a remake of Marathi blockbuster ‘Sairat’ and but ‘there are a few different elements’ in the film also, director Shashank Khaitan said.
“Our ‘Dhadak’ is quite similar to ‘Sairat’, yet there are a few different elements that the audience will find out once they watch the film,” he said. Of what inspired him to remake ‘Sairat’, Shashank Khaitan said, “There are many elements in ‘Sairat’ that inspired me and I wanted to incorporate them in my story.” ‘Dhadak’ is Shashank Khaitan’s third directorial venture. He had earlier directed ‘Humpty Sharma Ki Dulhania’ and ‘Badrinath Ki Dulhania’, both starring Alia Bhatt and Varun Dhawan.
National Award-winning film ‘Sairat’, which released in 2016, featured Rinku Rajguru and Akash Thosar.
