First batch of tea exported after Russia lift ban

 
The first batch of tea was exported to Russia today after the tea ban imposed on Sri Lanka was lifted, the Tea Board said.
Chairman of the Tea Board Rohan Pethiyagoda said that measures were taken to ensure the quality and freshness of the tea batch exported to Russia.
Russia imposed a ban on Sri Lankan tea exports on December 18 after condemning a consignment of tea which contained an insect.
