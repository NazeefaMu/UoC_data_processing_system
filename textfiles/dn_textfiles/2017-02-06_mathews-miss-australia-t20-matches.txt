Mathews to miss Australia T20 matches

The National Selections Committee of Sri Lanka Cricket is expected to meet on Tuesday (February 7) to decide the national squad for three T20 internationals Sri Lanka will play against Australia from 15 to 23 February.
Prior to the meeting however, it has been announced that captain Angelo Mathews will not be part of the squad as he has been ruled out due to a hamstring injury.
The skipper sustained an injury during the second T20 International against South Africa at the Wanderers Stadium in Johannesburg last month. Although he had made prior arrangements to leave during some point of the tour, he made an early exit following his injury.
The meeting on Tuesday will decide the squad and the captain who will lead the team for the three matches.
Accordingly the team will arrive in Canberra on Monday February 13 with the first match scheduled for February 15. The team will participate in one T20 tour match and three T20 International matches.
The national team has also been invited by the Prime Minister of Australia Malcolm Turnbull to attend an early evening cocktail to celebrate the annual Prime Minister’s XI match at Parliament House upon their arrival.
The team is expected to fly back to the country on 23 February.
