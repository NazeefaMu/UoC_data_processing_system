Second Sri Lankan to reach maiden Test century with a six : Kusal  thwarts  Australia with a Mendis Special

 
Twenty-one year-old Kusal Mendis emerged as Sri Lanka’s savior when he scored a magnificent unbeaten maiden Test century in conditions not suitable for stroke-making to prevent Australia from running away with the first Test at the Pallekele International Stadium yesterday.
Mendis was 169 not out scored off 243 balls when bad light ended play early on the third day with Sri Lanka 282 for six wickets – an overall lead of 196 with four second innings wickets in hand.
Dilruwan Perera was the other not out batsman on five. Australia have the second new ball first thing in the morning today and will be looking to finish off the Lankan innings as quickly as possible and set themselves a target which is within their reach.

Sri Lanka made 117 in their first innings and Australia replied with 203.
It was an extraordinary innings from Mendis from what has already gone before on the first two days when 21 wickets fell and no batsmen could score more than 47.
Mendis who came to the wicket early at the start of play yesterday when Mitchell Starc trapped Dimuth Karunaratne for a duck with the fifth ball of the morning and batted throughout nearly two sessions putting up a faultless display of batting.

The nearest he came to being dismissed was at 69 when the Australians went for a review for an lbw decision off left-arm spinner Steve O’Keefe.
Playing the seventh Test of his career Mendis who has shown a lot of promise of doing something big from the time he made his way into the Sri Lanka Test side against the West Indies at the P Sara Oval last year showed that he had arrived with an innings full of flamboyance that saw him strike 20 fours and a six in his 312 minutes stay at the crease.
Mendis had eight scores of over 25 runs in his first 13 Test innings and prior to his memorable maiden Test hundred he had 53 as his highest Test score made in difficult conditions against England at Leeds in May against the likes of Anderson, Broad and Finn.
There was never a dull moment when Mendis was at the crease. He was always busy keeping the fielders on their toes with some deft placements and brisk running between the wickets interspersed by a flow of boundaries whenever the bowlers erred in line or length.
Mendis went to his maiden Test hundred in style reaching it with a slog sweep for six off Nathan Lyon over midwicket off 143 balls. Among the Sri Lankans only Aravinda de Silva had got to his maiden Test hundred with a six when he hooked Pakistan fast bowler Imran Khan at Faisalabad in October 1985. De Silva was only 19 then and the youngest Sri Lankan to score a maiden Test hundred. Asanka Gurusinha took the record from him five months later by becoming the youngest by a lesser number of months.
Mendis’ knock of 169 not out is the highest score by a Sri Lankan against Australia in Sri Lanka beating Asanka Gurusinha’s innings of 137 at the SSC in 1992. He reached the 150 mark in the final over before tea by crashing a short Lyon delivery through the covers for his 18th four.
It is also the second highest score made by a Sri Lankan in reaching his maiden Test century. Only Brendon Kuruppu’s double century (201 not out) v New Zealand at the CCC grounds in 1987 stands in his way.
Mendis is also 24 runs shy of becoming the highest scorer for Sri Lanka against Australia. The present record is held by Kumar Sangakkara who scored 192 at Hobart in 2007.
Sri Lanka lost the wickets of Karunaratne, Kaushal Silva (7) and Angelo Mathews (9) pretty cheaply to be 86-4 at one stage. But Mendis found in vice-captain Dinesh Chandimal a useful ally and the pair quietly but surely built up a partnership in mid-afternoon to frustrate the Australians.
They added 117 off 186 balls for the fifth wicket before Chandimal lost his wicket falling lbw to Marsh for 42, but debutant Dhananjaya de Silva once again batted with positive intent and helped Mendis build another useful partnership that produced 71 runs for the sixth wicket. De Silva’s share was 36.
Australia was somewhat handicapped when O’Keefe went out of the firing line having to retire hurt with a right hamstring injury while fielding in the 49th over of the innings. His injury was being assessed. O’Keefe had to pull up after bowling two deliveries of his 17th over and retire. Voges filled the void by completing the over.
