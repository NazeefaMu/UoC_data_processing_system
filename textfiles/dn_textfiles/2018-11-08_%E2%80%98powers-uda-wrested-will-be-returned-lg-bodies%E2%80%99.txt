‘Powers UDA wrested will be returned to LG bodies’

The powers of the Local Government institutions which were acquired by the Urban Development Authority will be vested in the local government institutions without delay, said Megapolis and Western Development Minister Dinesh Gunawardena yesterday.
The Minister said all the projects that had been initiated by the Urban Development Authority would be continued, while measures would be taken to realise the people’s housing dreams.
Minister Gunawardena was speaking after assuming duties at the Megapolis and Western Development Ministry yesterday morning.
“A new government has been set up with new Ministers and Mahinda Rajapaksa as the Prime Minister,” Minister Gunawardena said. “This government will recommence the development programmes. Although the development rate has dropped to 3.6 percent now, when the government was handed over in 2015, the development rate in the country was nearly nine percent.”
The Minister also said they would take measures to run a stable government and a country, while guaranteeing the aspirations of the people are fulfilled. The foundation for this situation was created with the vote of the public at the recent Local Government Election.
Minister Gunawardena also said the new government has the majority. “The Speaker has issues with his arithmetic sometimes. He did not understand that 70 was greater than 16,” he said.
A Vote on Account would be presented in Parliament on November 16, the Minister said.
