Leadership through arts

The Moratuwa Arts Forum (MAF) broke a new path, away from customary artistic activities, to execute a Leadership workshop for around 200 senior students in Hatton. It was held at Sri Pada College and the students benefited immensely by the educative lectures and the course material provided.
The lectures were delivered by Brian Coorey, Hemaka Fernando and Hiran Fernando on Leadership and personal growth, effective communication, teamwork and how to choose your future career. This program provided a platform for the Forum to further the cause of love, understanding, peace and harmony through co-existence among all communities in Sri Lanka.
This MAF project was supported by the Past Pupils Associations of Sri Pada College. The College Principal Wasantha Kaviraja thanked the forum for taking the initiative to come all the way to Hatton for the benefit of students of the area and admired this meaningful social responsibility effort by a group of predominantly musicians and artistes.
MAF President Erinton Perera, OBA Representative Chandana Jayaweera and Sama Cooray of the Moratuwa Divisional Secretariat also spoke. Among the other committee members who participated were Priya Peiris and Angelo Fernando.
This was the first instance the Forum embarked on such a novel project outside Moratuwa.
