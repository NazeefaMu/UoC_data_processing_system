Pandateruppu Girls HS and St Joseph’s College champs

Girls’ winners - Paddapthirippu Girls High School, Jaffna team with the champion trophy and medals
Pandateruppu Girls High School - Jaffna and St, Joseph College - Maradana emerged girls’ and boys’ champions respectively in the All Island Under-14 Inter-Schools Soccer Championship sponsored by the Plenty Foods’ ‘Samaposha’ brand for the ninth successive time and concluded at the Race Course grounds recently.
Jaffna girls displayed a superb teamwork to rout much fancied Kurunegala Maliyadewa Balika Vidyalaya 2-0 in the girls’ final while Joes edged out Gateway International College, Rajagiriya 3-0 in the boys’ final. Maliyadewa Balika maintained a superb record since the inauguration of this tournament and has qualified for the final in six occasions. But the under dogs Jaffna lasses left no room for their Kurunegala opponents to steal the crown this year. The Gateway International College, Rajagiriya will mark the first ever international school presence at a final of this tournament’s history.
Krishanthi Rajendra from Pandateruppu Girls High School was adjudged the girls’ Best Player and her schoolmate Sharmila Suriyakumar was awarded as the Best Goal-keeper. Mahajana College, Jaffna secured the girls’ third place.
Pathum Gimhana of St, Joseph’s College was picked as the boys’ Best Player while Thisula De Silva of Gateway International College was awarded the boys’ Best Goal-keeper award. De Mazenod College, Kandana won the boys’ third place.
Over 10,000 school children from 548 schools across the island vied for honours at this year’s edition. Altogether 30 boys’ teams and 21 girls’ teams lined up for the preliminary round matches. Qualifying matches were held at five locations in Colombo.
