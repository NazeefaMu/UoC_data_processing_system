President ACC and SLC, Thilanga Sumathipala together with the members of the Board, the Executive Committee and the Management of the ACC, and of Sri Lanka Cricket, congratulated Anurag Thakur on his election as the President of the Board of Control for Cricket in India.
In a congratulatory letter to the new BCCI chief, Sumathipala said “… Your unanimous victory reflects the confidence and faith of the membership of the BCCI … I am confident that under your leadership the game will continue to progress and flourish …”
