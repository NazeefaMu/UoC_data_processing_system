[Christian Perspectives]
In conversation with Jesus


The first significant moment in a Christian's life is baptism when his parents dedicate the newborn to you. Thereafter, he is nurtured, cared with love and protection and put on his feet to take the first steps toward's his life journey. The child slowly but steadily grows in his parental care. When he starts looking around at the beautiful world before him the blue heavens and birds chirping atop trees, he hears the sound of music, he is snatched. Snatched away cruelly from life.
Yes, it was the same two thousand years ago when for the first time, we are confronted with Harod ordering the persecution of baby boys from their wailing mothers in order to trap and kill you as a baby but the guardian angle guided you and earthly parents away from danger so that you will survive to preach the Word of God and shower love upon the young as the Holy Bible reveal.
‘Oh Lord, our Lord, your greatness is seen in all the world.
Your praises reach up to heaven it is sung by children and babies’
Psalm.8
After riding thousands of cruel waves, your little helpless baby's body finally rested on a migrant shore, snatched away from his mother's clutches as she fought the waves and wind to shield him when the boat overturned to yield him to the ocean. Baby Aylan Kurdi lay on burning sand that shocked the world few days later.
And all this time you were watching from above Jesus.
Tell me why? tell the world what happened. Perhaps, you sent this child of innocence as a messenger or a wake-up call to violent people who caused this tragedy. To open up their conscience, rip their heart and search for repentance.
No, Lord Jesus; it never happened. These criminals continue their massacre. They will never change and in the melee, the young are sacrificed. The escalation around the world, especially in the Mid-East in untold proportions is devastating and the least we can do is to pray for their rescue.
Can you hear me, Lord Jesus? I always converse with you and often you hear what I tell you but these children? The ones you love so much and rests in your beautiful heart. See what St. Mark had to say during your time:
"Some people brought children to Jesus for him to place his hands on them but the disciples scolded them. When Jesus noticed this he was angry and said to his disciples 'Let the children come to me and do not stop them because the Kingdom of God belongs to such as these. I assure that whoever does not receive the Kingdom of God like a child will never enter it'. Then he took children in his arms, placed his hands on each of them and blessed them. Mark 10,13
Or, Lord Jesus is it the sins of the parents that are upon them and pay the penalty for such crimes. Some mothers kill their newborn while others cause abortions. Fathers and elders sexually assault their little girls. They are harassed willfully to cause pain in sadistic manner as it happened to little Seya Sadwami whose gruesome sexual murder shocked not only us but the word. These monsters keep repeating over and over again vengefully with no regard to your preaching. Jesus why cannot these monsters realize their follies and turn to your Word and the Bible and be spiritually awakened.
Why don’t you make it happen.
It is heart - rending to see little children put to hard labour, toil for their bread and butter when they should be playing with each other. Some starve, naked with nothing to cover them as the rain pour upon their skeletal bodies. They beg, they steal for want of food.
Why have the young to suffer when they are children of God, created and life breathed into them.
Everything is in your hands, sweet Jesus and all I am asking you is to save them from strife and Satan.
