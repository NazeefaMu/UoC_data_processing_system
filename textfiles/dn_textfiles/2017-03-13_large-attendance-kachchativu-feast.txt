Large attendance at Kachchativu feast

The Annual Feast of St. Anthony’s Church in the Kachchativu Island was held yesterday under the guidance of Jaffna Diocese Vicar General Rev. Fr. Joseph Vass Jebaratnam.
The festival, which commenced with hoisting the flag on Saturday, was concluded yesterday with the participation of 6,500 Sri Lankan devotees.
Indian devotees did not attend the annual feast this year even though over 500 Indians had confirmed their participation.
The Sri Lanka Navy provided the devotees all the facilities including the supply of drinking water, electricity, sanitary facilities and ensured their overall safety.
The Sri Lankan Navy Commander Ravindra Wijegunawardane told the Daily News that the Navy facilitates the feast annually, deploying human and physical resources.
He added that the Navy has completely renovated St.Anthony’s Church at a cost of Rs. 7.7 million and handed over the Church in December last year.
