Correction on Wellawatte building collapse...

Reference the new item published in the Daily News under the headline “Wellawatta building collapse: low quality steel, inferior concrete mixture main culprits” on May 31, ‘Daily News Business’ has mistakenly quoted State Engineering Corporation of Sri Lanka as the source.
This should be corrected as National Building Research Organisation.
State Engineering Corporation of Sri Lanka (SECSL) General Manager, Eng. D.T. Rajasekaran in a letter the Daily News states as follows. “ We (SECSL) would like to bring to your notice that State Engineering Corporation has not officially given any statement or reports to the media on the usage of steel, concrete or any other building material which was used for the construction of the above collapsed building. And we were not informed on this subject in any form before the publishing of this article.”
“We completely deny this report published in your news paper “Daily News Business” supplement on Wednesday, May 31, 2017.”
“Further, structural engineers were involved in the initial investigation of the collapsed building and the report has been submitted to the court. At this moment we cannot comment on the reason for the collapse since this is under the purview of the court.”
