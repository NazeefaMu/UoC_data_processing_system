Mrs B’s timeless lesson
Personal values are people’s internal conception of what is good, beneficial, important, useful, desirable, constructive, etc. Values such as honesty, hard work and discipline can increase an employee’s efficacy in the workplace and help them serve as positive role model to others.
The definition of an attitude is a way of feeling or acting towards a person, thing or situation. Passion for a sport, dislike for a certain actor and negativity towards life, in general, are examples of attitude.
Core values are the fundamental beliefs of a person or organisation.
Discipline is the practice of training people to obey rules or a code of behaviour, using punishment to correct disobedience. I can explain all these things by a short true story. This happened long ago at Royal College.
A student had a habit of coming late to school. The head prefect noticed this and advised the student to bring a letter from a parent regarding his bad habit. The head prefect instructed not to come to school without this letter.
The next day the student came to school with a letter from his mother explaining reasons for her son’s late coming and the matter was settled. Mother had requested to excuse her son and had advised the son to be punctual. The student was late Anura Bandaranaike. Mother was late Sirimavo Bandaranaike. The head prefect was late Neelam Thiruchelvam.
Sirimavo Bandaranaike was a powerful figure at the time.
Let us learn a lesson from this true short story.
