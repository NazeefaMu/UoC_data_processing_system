Thoughts on a better world
Do you agree that we should adopt as our life's motto: “Be kind to one another.”
This includes avoiding resentment of any kind. Resentment is corrosive to the human psyche that we persuade the world media not to give inordinate prominence to misdeeds of jihadists. This prominence is what they hope the world media to project. This prominence given to misdeeds is akin to feeding the wild beasts.
Preserve our planet from ecological disaster by rewarding those countries which preserve their rain forests etc. Make the occupiers of buildings abutting our roads responsible for keeping the space in front of their properties spotlessly clean.
Daily papers should run a page for recording complaints received from the pubic in relation to lack of public service and repeat the complaints till they are satisfactorily dealt with. If no action is taken after a reasonable period the names of the sleeping officials concerned should be printed.
Books, especially those used in schools, should not portray dark people as villains while the fair Caucasians are shown as heroes. This could to some extent lessen ethnic bias for our Cricket team. Subject members to counselling before taking to the field which prevents them from trying to hit sixes and getting caught. We recall here immortal Don Bradman's two great innings (482-&388+) which did not contain a single six. Tail-enders to be taught to bat. At present their average contribution does not go beyond one figure.
Also our batsmen should appreciate the role of the bat which is, for the most part to hit the ball and not to kiss it and get caught to a silly position fielder or one in the slips.
