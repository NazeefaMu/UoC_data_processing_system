Have a banana peel ?

You probably have been throwing banana peels till now, so this is going to be a shocker for you. Many people in India have been using banana peels to many advantages for decades now. Not only banana peel is edible but it also holds many benefits. These peels are full of anti-fungal compounds, antibiotic agents, fibre, nutrients and other health-enhancing properties.
Here are 10 healthy reasons why you should eat banana peels:
