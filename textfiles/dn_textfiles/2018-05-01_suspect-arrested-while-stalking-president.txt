Suspect arrested while stalking President

While President Maithripala Sirisena was taking part in this year’s state Vesak festival at the Bingiriya Devagiri Raja Maha Viharaya in the Kurunegala district, the President’s Security Division (PSD) arrested an individual who had allegedly been stalking the President.
The suspect was later handed over to Bingiriya Police for further investigations. He had been identified as a resident of the Maligawatta area in Colombo.
The arrest had been made following a tip-off received from a state intelligence officer.
