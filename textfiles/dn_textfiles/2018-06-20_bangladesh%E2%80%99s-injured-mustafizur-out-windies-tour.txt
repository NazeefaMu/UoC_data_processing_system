Bangladesh’s injured Mustafizur out of Windies tour

Dhaka, Tuesday: Bangladesh have left out Mustafizur Rahman from their 15-man squad for next month's Test series against West Indies after the pacer failed to recover from an injury.
The 22-year-old left-arm seamer, who has claimed 26 wickets in 10 Tests, hurt his left big toe last month during an Indian Premier League match he played for the Mumbai Indians. – AFP
