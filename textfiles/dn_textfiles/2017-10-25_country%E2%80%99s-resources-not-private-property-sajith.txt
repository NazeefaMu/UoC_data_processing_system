Country’s resources not private property: Sajith

The country’s resources are not the private property of the ruling political party. They are the common property of the public. As politicians of the ruling party, we only act as trustees of these resources, Housing and Construction Minister Sajith Premadasa said.
The Minister was addressing a meeting held to mark the distribution of housing loans under the ‘Samata Sevana Visiri Niwasa Naya’ programme held under the Debarawewa Regional Gamudawa programme, recently.
We cannot claim to be their owners. But members of the previous regime acted as the sole proprietors of the country’s resources, the minister added.
Minister Premadasa said as trustees of the country’s resources, they should use State funds with frugality.
The whole country should rise to fight against corruption.
The Minister said the Government recently presented a Steering Committee report on a new constitution for public discussion. It was not a final draft as it contained conflicting ideas and proposals tabled by various stakeholders. When a new Constitution was drafted, it would offer the same pre-eminent position for Buddhism and safeguard the unitary status of the country. But opponents were trying to create discussions by alleging that the Steering Committee report was trying to destroy Buddhism and country’s unitary status.
Today, certain people entertaining dreams about becoming President and Prime Minister were performing a sinful act by trying to create discussion among the Maha Sangha saying Buddhism would be destroyed under a new Constitution.
The minister said, “Today, 582 families in Debarawewa, Gemunupura, Ekamuthugama, Sandungama and Vijithapura Grama Niladhari Divisions are receiving Rs. 166.6 million as housing loans under the ‘Visiri Niwasa Naya’ programme at a very easy interest of 5 percent. Out of them, 233 families will receive Rs. 400,000 each to build a house and the balance 349 families Rs. 200,000 each to complete half-built houses. More development projects will be launched in these regions.
The drinking water supply in most of these DS divisions had turned brackish. A sum of Rs. 40 million will be set apart by my ministry to solve this problem and provide pure drinking water to people especially in Gemunupura, Ekamuthugama and Sandungama DS Divisions, the minister said.
