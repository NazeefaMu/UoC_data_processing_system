Nic Pothas as interim head coach?

Present fielding coach of the Sri Lanka cricket team Nic Pothas is expected to take over as the interim head coach following Graham Ford’s departure from the country at the end of the ICC Champions Trophy.
It is learnt that Ford had sent a letter stating he has issues with newly-appointed Cricket Manager Asanka Gurusinha and has had a lengthy discussion with SLC’s top brass before he left the country.
Earlier, SLC sources had stated that Ford was off for a short vacation, but it has later turned out to be that he has more or less gone for good.
Sri Lanka has hit a new low at the moment being eighth ranked in ODIs and facing the danger of losing automatic qualification for the ICC Cricket World Cup 2019.
Sri Lanka are currently preparing to take on Zimbabwe in a five-match ODI series followed by a one-off Test.
