Small group in govt. criticizing me for appointing Bond Commission: President

President Maithripala Sirisena said a small group in the government continuously criticised him for appointing a Presidential Commission to probe the Bond issue.
The President further said that those individuals had also spent money to run social media trolls that spread hate and insults against him.
“If Ven. Sobitha Thera was alive, he would have backed me for appointing the Presidential commission,” he said.
He was addressing the event organized to commemorate the second death anniversary of Ven. Maduluwawe Sobitha Thera, yesterday at the “Ape Gama”, in Battaramulla.
“I can handle the criticisms from the Opposition, but the ones who are criticizing me within the government, are, in a way, acting against the principles of Ven. Sobitha Thera,’ he said.
The President said that there was a huge outcry from the public as well as civil society organizations to probe the fraud.
“We were not appointed to fill our own pockets or to rob money. I did what I promised to the people,” he said.
The President further said that Ven Sobitha Thera never had any political motives, he always tried to protect the rights of people in this country and added that the concept of common candidate originated in 1988 and finally it was the present government that made it a reality in 2015.
“When I contested for the 2015 Presidential election as the common candidate, there were instances where stones were thrown, stages were set on fire and the state media used to the maximum to criticize us. But we overcame all those barriers and finally won the hearts of the people,” he said.
