Microscopes for Akkaraipattu schools

Former Eastern Province Opposition Leader M. S. Udumalebbe has made arrangements to provide binocular microscopes to 11 selected schools in the Akkaraipattu Educational Zone, to assist students to study science and technology subjects conveniently.
A sum of Rs. 660,000 has been allocated for this project by Opposition Leader M. S. Udumalebbe to the Akkaraipattu Zonal Education Office through the Eastern Province Department of Education on the request of former Akkaraipattu Zonal Education Director A. L. M. Cassim and Assistant Education Director (Science) M. M. A. Wahid.
Under this programme, Addalaichenai Central College (National School), Addalaichenai Al-Muneera Girls’ High School, Oluvil Al-Hamra Maha Vidyala, Palamunai Minhaj Maha Vidyalaya, Akkaraipattu Muslim Central College (National School), Akkaraipattu Ayesha Muslim Ladies' College, Akkaraipattu As-Siraj Maha Vidyalaya, Pallikudyeruppu Al-Faiza Maha Vidyalaya, Pottuvil Central College, Pottuvil Al-Irfan Ladies' College and Pottuvil Al-Kalam Vidyalaya will be benefited.
These selected schools presently lack binocular microscopes for their students’ studies. These equipments would assist students to do their practical tests and study the subjects properly to sit for their G. C. E. Ordinary Level and Advanced Level Examinations.
Teachers were taught on how to handle the microscopes by the Assistant Education Director (Science) M. M. A. Wahid, at the Zonal Education Office premises in Akkkaraipattu.
