Poddala Jayantha makes fresh plaint to CID

Journalist Poddala Jayantha who was abducted and tortured during the previous regime in 2009, lodged a complaint with the CID yesterday.
He requested a full scale investigation into the degrading and inhumane treatment meted out to him by past rulers.
Speaking to the media after handing over his complaint Poddala Jayantha said there seemed to be a certain extent of democracy existing in the country today after the January 8, 2015 change effected by people who aspired for a change.This positive change for the better should never be underestimated, Jayantha said.
Jayantha was accompanied to the CID by representatives of the Sri Lanka Working Journalists Association, several other journalists organisations and a group of social activists. Jayantha who was also a former President of the SLWJA was abducted on June 1, 2009 by group of armed men in a white van. As he remained with his a limbs broken he was hospitalised. Later he left for New York USA in December 2010.
Jayantha said 8 years had passed since his abduction but no investigation had been made so far into the cruelty meted out to him despite making written complaints to several leading officials including the IGP. This time he decided to make a fresh complaint when he arrived in Sri Lanka to see his elderly parents.He said although the CID accepted his complaint they said they could not start any investigation without an order from the IGP.
However he handed over the complaint to the CID Director and expects him to forward it to the IGP and receive his order.Jayantha said suspects involved in the Keith Noyahr abduction have already been arrested and he suspected them to be involved in his conduction too.
