Ceylinco Life retirement planning month begins

The best time to start investing in retirement is at the commencement of employment, a new campaign to be launched by Ceylinco Life in May asserts.
The life insurance leader’s 10th annual Retirement Planning Month begins country-wide on May 2, with the company’s entire sales force being tasked with generating wider awareness of the importance of retirement planning.
Focussing on retirement readiness, the campaign poses the question “Can you retire tomorrow?” and simplifies the perceived intricacies of investing for retirement with simple explanations, illustrations and examples.
Some 4,000 members of the Ceylinco Life sales team will be deployed in door-to-door calling in cities and towns across Sri Lanka throughout May to take this message to the masses, the company said.
They will be supported by media communications campaigns and will be armed with a thoughtfully prepared brochure that demystifies retirement planning. A series of promotional activities in selected locations is also planned.
May has been Ceylinco Life’s designated Retirement Planning Month since 2008, and every year, the sales team is tasked with focusing on this segment of business throughout the month.
Ceylinco Life offers a range of Retirement Plans that offer a higher accumulation rate than most savings accounts. Returns from retirement plans are exempt from tax.
Ceylinco Life Retirement Plans can even be purchased online by visiting the company’s website www.ceylincolife.com
Ceylinco Life’s flexible retirement plans make it possible for saving for retirement to be commenced with as little as Rs 1,000, with payments made monthly, quarterly, half-yearly or annually for a term starting from five years.
Sri Lanka’s life insurance market leader since 2004, Ceylinco life has close to a million lives covered by active policies.
