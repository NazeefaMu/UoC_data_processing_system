‘Wildlife officer’s behaviour unacceptable’

The behaviour of the wildlife officer who shot a wild she elephant to death can never be accepted as a wildlife officer cannot behave like a hunter, Left Centre Convener Chameera Perera said.
The wildlife officer had opened fire at the she elephant during an attempt to rescue four wild elephants including the she elephant fallen into a farm well at the Kombuwaiththakulam in Omanthai, Vavuniya recently. Perera urged Sustainable Development and Wildlife Minister Gamini Jayawickrama Perera to take prompt action to conduct an impartial investigation into the shooting. Perera asked why the wildlife officers used live bullets instead of anaesthesia or rubber bullets. Sustainable Development and Wildlife Minister Gamini Jayawickrama Perera has ordered full scale investigation into the death of the she elephant.
