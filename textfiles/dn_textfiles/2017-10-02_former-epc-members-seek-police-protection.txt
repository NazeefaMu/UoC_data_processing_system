Former EPC members seek police protection

A proposal seeking police protection to all members of the Eastern Provincial Council including provincial ministers until a fresh election is held to the council was forwarded to the President, Prime Minister and the the subject ministers, Former Council Chairman Chandradasa Galappaththi said.
The Council stood dissolved at present.
He said he made the proposal as members had pointed out that the council covered an area where an ethnic conflict had just ended and peace was slowly returning. He said, therefore, they needed personal security further.
He said he had informed all former members to return computers, tabs and other equipment given for them for official work.
