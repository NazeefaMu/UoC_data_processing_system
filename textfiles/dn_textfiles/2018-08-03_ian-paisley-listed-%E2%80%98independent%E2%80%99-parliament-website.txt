Ian Paisley listed as ‘Independent’ on parliament website

Ian Paisley’s party affiliation has been changed on the British Parliament website from being a member of the DUP to ‘Independent’.
The North Antrim MP is set to serve a 30-day suspension from the House of Commons after he failed to declare two free luxury family holidays to Sri Lanka.
Paisley has also been suspended from the DUP pending the outcome of a further investigation. A spokeswoman for the House of Commons said the change in his status on their website was standard procedure.
She said, “If an MP is suspended by their party, they are classed as an independent MP.”
