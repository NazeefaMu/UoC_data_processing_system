Write harvest

That time of the year for English writers has come once again. Despite attracting criticism from all quarters, Gratiaen is finally stepping into its 23rd term on May 14. Dr Harshana Rambukwella, a Trustee of the Gratiaen Trust and Director, Postgraduate Institute of English, Open University, explains to Daily News on how Gratiaen could enrich Sri Lanka’s English-reading community.
Q: The Gratiaen judgement faces criticism almost every year. What is your response ?
A: I am not sure if that is accurate. There is far less criticism of the Gratiaen Prize compared to literary prizes such as Swarnapusthaka Awards or the State Literary Prize and many other literary prizes awarded in this country annually. I should add that decisions taken by literary judging panels anywhere in the world are criticised in this fashion. The appreciation of literature is very subjective so it is not surprising that people would express divergent opinions after a prize announcement.
Q: What is your general viewpoint of criticism ?
A: It is wrong to see criticism as essentially a negative thing. The fact that people are criticising a particular prize means that it has achieved a certain level of significance. What would be more troubling is if there was no ‘buzz’ around a particular literary prize because that means the reading public and the literary community in general are indifferent to it.
Q: You are familiar with both English and Sinhalese literary scenes. What is your take on the state of critical commentary in Sri Lanka ?
A: It seems to me that over the years the quality of literary criticism has declined. What we often get are either personal vilifications of particular authors or works rather than substantive critiques that engage with the literary or cultural merits of the work under discussion.
If not vilification, what you find is people questioning the judging process: how judges are appointed or the suitability of the judges or sometimes rather absurd conspiracy theories about how and why certain prizes are awarded. Some of these may be legitimate questions but if you want to engage in substantive literary critique you need to supplement your critique with nuanced critique – you need to critically evaluate the work, reading it with empathy and attention to detail, place it within its literary genre and draw inter-textual and inter-cultural comparisons and use insights from literary theory. This is something we see very rarely in Sri Lanka.
If you look at something like the New York Times, the Guardian, the London Review of Books or the occasional piece in Himal Magazine you get a very high level of critical engagement that we rarely see in Sri Lanka. Part of the problem really is ignorance. Many reviews I have seen are uninformed about global literary trends and therefore negatively evaluate what they see as something that is deviating from the ‘norm’. In some ways social media and blogs in Sri Lanka are better places to look for informed literary criticism compared to the mainstream media.
Q: How do you think the Gratiaen prize can offer a remedy to that phenomenon ?
A: I am not sure if the Gratiaen Prize per se, or a book prize in general, can do much to impact literary criticism – that will be a much broader project involving the training of journalists, book publishers supporting critical discussions on texts, etc. What the Gratiaen Prize and other book prizes do is to create a culture which encourages writing. Essentially the existence of something like the Gratiaen Prize, now in its twenty-third year and awarded without a break since 1993, gives writers something to aspire to. I personally believe that the more literary prizes and literary events we can offer, the better – especially in a socio-economic context where the value of literature and art is being increasingly made subservient to the needs of the market.
The Gratiaen is also unique because we admit unpublished work and work from a wide variety of genres – novels, short stories, poetry, dramatic scripts and even creative memoirs. This admittedly makes the task of judging complicated and challenging but given the size of the English writing and reading community in Sri Lanka we feel keeping the prize open to as many categories of creative writing as possible is important.
Q: English readership in Sri Lanka is much lagging behind as compared with Sinhala readership. How could this be overcome ?
A: I think this is a systemic problem that has no easy answers. To create a vibrant English language reading and writing community we first need to address systemic problems in our education system. Language policies adopted in the past contributed to this situation and now some corrective measures have been taken. But the problem is complicated.
One of the reasons why past language policies attempted to unseat English from its position of privilege was because of its colonial legacy and the ways in which it served to exclude a majority of the population. Unfortunately those same policies in reality contributed to the continuation of English as an elite language.
Q: Comparison aside, do you see any progress in English readership ?
A: Now we are seeing a massive resurgence of interest in English – there are thousands of tuition classes, thousands of courses on offer and all state education institutions also offer English in one form or the other. Today’s approach to teaching the language is also different.
It is now primarily seen as a tool for social mobility and professional development. This might be pragmatically effective in one sense because we don’t then need to deal with the complications of English as a language of privilege and its elitist and imperial legacies but at the same time it will never cultivate the kind of reading and writing public you refer to in your question.
Perhaps the solution is to strike a balance and look at English as a communicative tool but at the same time look at it more holistically as a language of significant cultural and literary merit. This would, however, mean confronting the fraught issues of the politics of English – but no language is politically neutral and trying to treat it so will not get you very far.
Q: Could you explain the criterion of selecting the best work for the Gratiaen prize ?
A: There is no set-criterion. As I explained in my response to your first question, literary judgments are by nature highly subjective. If you were to replace one judging panel with another, the outcome could be quite different. While there are some generic criteria that all literary judging panels will look for, there is a great deal that is variable. Attempting to deny or neutralize this subjectivity is futile.
In all Gratiaen judging panels we try to look for three perspectives: an informed general reader, an academic/literary critic and a creative writer. Our assumption is that these diverse perspectives will bring a degree of representativeness to the judging process, so that it is not biased too much towards one perspective. I would also like to stress that just because a writer does not win a prize from a particular panel does not mean his/her work is not worthy of recognition. There have been many instances in literary history of authors whose work has been rejected on multiple occasions going on to become highly successful and critically recognized writers later in their professional careers. The inherent instability of human experience and life is something reflected in literature and we need to be sensitive to this – it is after all this element that makes literature ‘human’.
Q: How many entries have you received for this time’s prize ?
A: We received more than 50 entries this year. The numbers are important but so is quality. There have been years where judging panels have felt, while there were large numbers of entries, only a few could be considered substantive while there have been other years where the numbers have been low but there were a relatively larger number of ‘quality’ submissions. We will have to wait for the judges’ comments at the main event this year to see what they think of the submissions as a whole.
