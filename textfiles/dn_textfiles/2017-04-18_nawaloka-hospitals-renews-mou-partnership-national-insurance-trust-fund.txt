Nawaloka Hospitals renews MoU, partnership with National Insurance Trust Fund

Nawaloka Hospitals renewed their Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with the National Insurance Trust Fund (NITF), which was signed in 2015 to provide a significant healthcare partnership to benefit Government employees.
This landmark partnership provides the 2.5 million beneficiaries of the NITF and their family members with access to the myriad of high quality healthcare services provided by Nawaloka Hospitals at concessionary rates. The MoU was signed by NITF’s CEO Sanath C De Silva and Chairman Manjula De Silva. Signatories from Nawaloka were Director Harshith Dharmadasa and Head of Finance & Corporate Planning, Nalaka Niroshana.
“We are pleased to renew this agreement with Nawaloka Hospitals this year. Their flexibility and high quality of services makes them an ideal partner. With the cost of medical facilities and claims escalating agreements like these are critical in curtailing those rising costs to benefit the recipient and ensure that the total fabric of their life, including their financial viability after leaving the hospital, is protected,” said Sanath C. De Silva, CEO National Insurance Trust Fund.
Nawaloka Hospitals is a pioneer in the healthcare sector with the most advanced facilities in Colombo and Negombo. Driven by their vision to be the ‘Hospital of Tomorrow,’ Nawaloka continues to innovate to provide their patients and their families with extraordinary levels of service. Their latest innovation, medical packages, takes away the worries of unexpected medical costs and lets patients know the cost of treatment from the moment they are admitted.
“We see this partnership as invaluable to the betterment of our public service employees and our nation. As a provider of the finest healthcare services in the country, it is important that we remove any financial barriers people may face that would prevent them from seeking the best healthcare and help them focus on the sole purpose of getting better. And now, the services are available for residents of Wattala or Puttalam will be able to receive world class treatment at our Nawaloka Hospital in Negombo. This is yet another step we have taken to provide our services to patients with ease and convenience and quality healthcare wherever they may reside,” said Harshith Dharmadasa, Director Nawaloka Hospitals.
Nawaloka entered the state dominated healthcare sector in 1985 and was set up to mirror reputed hospitals in the region which offered advanced medical technology and expert medical care. With its entry the private healthcare system took root in Sri Lanka and people were provided with an alternative to seeking specialised treatment outside the country. The hospital was a pioneering initiative that built an impeccable reputation and has been at the forefront of the Sri Lankan healthcare sector for over three decades.
