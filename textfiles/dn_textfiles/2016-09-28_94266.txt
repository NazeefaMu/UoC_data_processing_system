Diverse rhythms

The Chitrasena Vajira Dance Foundation (CVDF), in collaboration with youth and professional artists from Jaffna, Batticaloa and Colombo, presented a show to a grand audience.
This was a major effort taken by Upeka Chitrasena, Managing Director of the Dance Foundation with the support of her sister Anjalika and brother Anudatta to promote and glitter their Academy, to pay gratitude to their parents: Vajira and Chitrasena. The training that the young boys and girls carried on with their rhythmic indicated the progress of Sri Lanka’s modern generation.
The hall was fully crowded with the sweet fragrance of incense to invoke blessings to the little dancers on stage. It was, in essence, respect to the Founder Chitrasena.
The show conveyed a message to the whole of Sri Lanka in dancing style. Though children from all four corners danced with their own traditional steps, it depicted that there are similarities in the construction of Bharatha Natyam and Kandyan dance.
Above all, the audience was shown that dancing is a language of gods.
This show is an offshoot of the discussions between the CVDF and Jaffna’s Kalabavanam Dance School Director Shanthinie Sivanesan.
The choreography was by Heshma Wignaraja in collaboration with the students from Kalabavanam Dance School.
The show categorised into four sessions. The first showcased the similarities, differences, opening chapters of narration of a dance of Bharatha Natyam and Kandiyan. The former was accompanied by Vocalists of Jaffna and later was with the beat of drums. The second was Saraswathi Pooja, depicting Bharatha style and Kandyan style side by side.
This was performed at the Sarasaviya Film Festival in 1991 to Carnatic music and Sinhala Drum beats. The third, Shared Stories,is a short collage of scenes inspired by the memories, experiences and hopes for the future of youngsters shared during workshops conducted in Batticaloa and Colombo. The students from Batticaloa performed.
It showed in action that students of different backgrounds, place and traditions have similar fears needs and dreams. The fourth was Saamaya. This item was originally choreographed by the Jonathan Hollander Artistic Director of the Battery Dance Company, New York in collaboration with CVDF. This was staged as a tribute to the experiences had through the Youth Create Project. Saamaya attempted to touch the surface of a deeper wound of a nation that is only just starting to rebuild.
This was a presentation of the students of CVDF to the beat of drums and Sinhala traditional musical instruments and vocals.
The background of the performance is based on postwar developments in areas of infrastructure, communication, transport and tourism which has created opportunities for artists in Sri Lanka.
The CVDF with CARE International was able to connect and build sustainable relationships with veterans in artistic fields from the North East, North and Colombo through dancing!
