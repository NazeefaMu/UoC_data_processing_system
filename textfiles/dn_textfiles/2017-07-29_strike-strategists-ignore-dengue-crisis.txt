Strike strategists ignore Dengue crisis

The strike this week by the trade unions attached to the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation (CPC) brought a new challenge to the government that hitherto has been facing the political rivalry of the Joint Opposition (JO), and other anti-government organisations and groups that were carrying out their opposition mainly on democratic footing. The walkout by the petroleum workers, with hardly any notice, especially with regard to such a vital supply of a resource for the functioning of society was a matter that needed the most swift and effective action by the government; both to keep society running and counter the criticisms that would be leveled at the government for the breakdown of services. The strike was against moves to bring Indian participation to the working of the Oil Tank Farm in Trincomalee, to make it a useful component of a developed economic system in the country, and against the lease agreement with the Chinese investors for the proper functioning of the Hambantota Harbour – the Magampura Mahinda Rajapaksa Port. The strike sought to win public support and sympathy with the use of the ‘patriotic nationalist’ slogan that it was against the “selling” of these two vital national development facilities, and by implication the key areas where they are located, to India and China.
What the strikers, who were obviously happy at being able to cripple the economy and society in one single move, with stopping the flow of petroleum based fuel in the country, with all the problems it would cause to the day-to-day lives of the people, in every class of society; did not realize was the opposition of the people to such a strike, with such massive hardship to the people, especially with the what is a near epidemic of Dengue fever. They had forgotten how the doctors of the GMOA had to pull back on their planned long strike, following the calls by His Eminence Malcolm Cardinal Ranjith, and other religious leaders, to reconsider their decision because of the spread of Dengue, and the related hardships faced by the people. The petroleum strikers may have thought that Dengue patients are only affected by a doctors’ strike, and not by the workers of any other section in society.
Interestingly, the GMOA doctors launched another strike almost in sync with the CPC workers, this time not mainly about SAITM, but with focus at the alleged attempt to ‘abduct’ Ryan Jayalath, the Convenor of the Medical Faculty Students’ Action Committee (MFSAC). The strike was called off the same day after discussions with Minister Sagala Ratnayaka, who is in charge of the Police, and an assurance that the complaints regarding this alleged abduction would be looked into, with some criticism of the Police action, too. The GMOA was thus able not to be hurt by the Dengue crisis.
Public opposition

But the situation with the CPC strikers was different. There was a huge public opposition to the strike, especially in the context of the Dengue situation, apart from all the hardships it would cause to the normal lives of the people. This opposition was both in the urban and rural areas. The strike imposed sudden hardship in taking suspected Dengue patients to a doctor or hospital, the visiting of Dengue patients in hospitals, and taking of necessary food and other assistance to patients. There was also a danger that if the CPC strike goes for long, it would affect the treatment to Dengue patients (and other patients too) in hospitals, with the inability to use equipment for diagnosis and treatment at these places. The CPC strike became a major health issue in the country, which far exceeded any ‘patriotic nationalist’ feelings over Trincomalee and Hambantota that the strike organisers were seeking to build upon.
This gave the government, both the necessity and the opportunity to bring in the Essential Service Regulations and deal with the situation, by bringing the Military to move into the key CPC operational locations, the refineries at Kolonnawa and Muthurajawela, and begin the dispatch of fuel to the country, despite opposition, and even physical obstacles by the strikers. The Military was also able to get a train load of fuel to move to Katunayake, to serve aviation needs, notwithstanding the strikers who slept on the track till they were removed. One aspect of the public reaction to the strike was seen in some persons who sought to take direct action against the strikers, matters that were calmed down by the Police and Military. At the end of the first day of operations, the Military had sent out several fuel bowsers and that train, from Kolonnawa and Muthurajawela. The strikers soon backed off, saying they have called off the strike temporarily till next Tuesday. There were also several bowsers with their tyres deflated at the locations, which showed the service breakdown planning by the strikers, which also showed the need for the Essential Service Regulations.
The strike trend on the ‘patriotic nationalist’ line was also planned to extend to the Port of Colombo, but the use of the Essential Services Regulations to deal with the CPC strikers, had given a warning to the port workers planning strike action. They stopped the action, knowing the Military may move in to carry out the operations.
As this is written the Hambantota Port agreement with the Chinese investors has been placed before Parliament and is due for debate. The JO will certainly make a big noise against it, but what is interesting is to know what plans the Rajapaksa Regime would have had about making the Magampura Mahinda Rajapaksa Port, constructed by the Chinese, a functional operation which it was not, for several years after it was opened. Would they have not continued with Chinese operations, to make this a functional port in the Indian Ocean Region? This has never been said in the JO criticism on the Hambantota Port issues, and it does not seem to interest the trade union activists opposed to the current arrangements, too.
The Government will now have to look at the proper functioning of the Hambantota Port, as well as the CPC, in the context of wider public support for continued activity in society, without the breakdown strategies of the trade unions largely aligned to the JO, and influenced by the ‘patriotic nationalist’ groups on Sinhala majoritarian extremism.
What the government should see in this trade union action is a major political move against it, when other political campaigns have so far failed to have any direct action against the government, although public opinion has been turned away. It will have to do a much better public awareness campaign on these two key areas of development which can be the vital aspects of development in Yahapalana Governance, which certainly needs a considerable build up in publicity to be seen as pro-people and society, in the context of postponed elections and the continuing debate on the new constitution, increasing corruption, and the moves to establish what some think is a Sangha Raja.
PC Polls delay
The Cabinet decision to amend the rules governing the conduct of Provincial Council Elections, which will require the holding of all PC elections on the same day, will certainly lead to more criticism of the government over poll delays. It is faced with the huge criticism over the delay in the Local Government Polls, which is hardly eased by the various statements made by the Minister of Local Government and Provincial Councils Faiszer Musthapha in this regard. The recent statement that the new changes will lead to a doubling of Local Government representatives will also lead to more criticism, with the public certainly not keen on increasing these ‘kindergarten or primary school’ trainees in the current political system.
With arrangements already being made to call nominations for the next elections to the North-Central, Eastern and Sabaragamuwa, PC elections in early October 2017, this Cabinet decision is most likely to postpone these elections, so that they would be held with all other PCs, under the amended rule. However, if the Government does not want a delay in the PC polls, it has the ability to expedite the planned amendments, and dissolve all PCs accordingly on one day, and hold the next elections at an early date.
It is to be seen what the government’s action will be. The requirement for petitions before the Supreme Court on the new amendments, and the parliamentary process on the amendments, point to a delay in the PC polls, and not the holding of polls for the three PCs that will end their terms by end September this year, by October 1, 2017 as planned. It is certainly a burden the government will have to bear, that need not have been kept this long for action.
Police trouble
The Police have been exposed in what are hasty decisions or statements that call for much more serious action – apart from daily mediation. High Court Judge M. Ilancheliyan, member of the Trial-at-Bar on the high profile rape and murder case of schoolgirl Vithya in Jaffna, has made it very clear that those who killed his guard policeman were in fact targeting him. He has raised questions about how the Police said it was not so before a full inquiry was done.
There is a similar situation over the attempted ‘abduction” of the Ryan Jayalath, the Convenor of the Medical Faculty Students’ Action Committee (MFSAC), with ‘white van’ allegations, too. The Minister of Law and Order has said the Police were wrong, as had so many others in their criticism of this, which the Police spokesman said was a normal arrest operation. It is time for the Police to be more thoughtful in its statements, and actions, too.
