New strategic approach for State Owned Enterprises

 
The Secretary to the President has issued directives to all State Owned Enterprises (SOEs) to prepare their Organizational Results Frameworks (ORFs) with Key Performance Indicators (KPIs), in order to have SEOs achieve expected results and improved productivity.
In order to ensure the achievement of results against the set targets, the Department of Project Management and Monitoring (DPMM) is also assigned to monitor them closely and report periodically on their progress.
Approximately, 307 institutions are currently functioning as SOEs. Following the instructions, 88 of them have prepared ORFs including KPIs so far and will operate according to the guidelines.
However, a large number of SOEs are still in the process of developing their ORFs. DPMM has observed that SOEs need more assistance in preparing ORFs, since this concept is novel to the organisations.
For this reason, the DPMM has already taken initiatives to improve the skills and knowledge of the management of SOEs in preparation of ORFs; Special Training Workshops, Weekly Consultative Clinics and an On-line Help Service.
The management of SOEs and other interested parties are welcome to visit the DPMM website; http://www.pmm.gov.lk for more information and to reserve places for weekly consultative clinics.
