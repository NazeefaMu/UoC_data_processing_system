Addressing the Valedictory Session, the Foreign Affairs Ministry Secretary said the Sri Lanka Foreign Policy and Economic Diplomacy Dialogue 2018 by the Economic Affairs and Trade Division was a high quality product of the Ministry and it showcased Sri Lanka’s potential and ability to interact with the rest of the world.
Referring to UN Secretary-General António Guterres’s emphasisduring the UN General Assembly on the relevance of multilateralism in today’s polarised world, he said the Dialogue was Sri Lanka’s contribution to the promotion of multilateralism and friendship among countries. He also hoped that the friendships established and experiences that were shared through initiatives of this nature would contribute to economically growing together.
The Additional Secretary, Economic Affairs and Trade of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs said the Dialogue had advanced the understanding among the participating diplomats about Sri Lanka, as well as the challenges and opportunities relating to each other’s countries.
It had also provided valuable insights to the Foreign Ministry’s Economic Diplomacy Programme, in promoting Sri Lanka through its Missions abroad.
He added that the Ministry would work towards ensuring that all participants remain networked in the future as well.
Director General of the BIDTI Ambassador Pamela J. Deen, while pointing out the importance of conducting the annual Dialogue, thanked the 23 participants for the commitment they showed throughout the programme. Dr. Ganeshan Wignaraja, the Executive Director of the LKI, highlighted the remarkable camaraderie that emanated through the Dialogue and the frankness of the participants in sharing their knowledge during the sessions.
Peta Helen Donald of Australia said they had the opportunity to understand first-hand about the development in Sri Lanka and that they go back to their 23 countries as Ambassadors for Sri Lanka.
She appreciated the excellent arrangements made for the programme and commended that the Dialogue was well directed towards its goals.
