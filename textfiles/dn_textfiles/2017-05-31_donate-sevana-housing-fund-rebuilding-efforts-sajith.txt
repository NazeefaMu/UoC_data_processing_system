Donate to 'Sevana' housing fund for rebuilding efforts: Sajith

Housing and Construction Minister Sajith Premadasa yesterday urged donors to give their funds to the 'Sevana Fund' for the rehabilitation of houses damaged due to the prevailing disaster situation of the country.
"The government has already taken measures to prepare estimates after gathering information of partly and totally damaged houses. The government hopes to rehabilitate these houses by using both, government funds and the donations," the minister said.
A spokesperson of the National Housing Development Authority asked willing persons and institutions to deposit their funds to the Account Number 204100140003931 of Peoples Bank and 100 percent of these funds have been released from the income tax.
For further information, please contact the Deputy General Manager (Finance) of the National Housing Development Authority via 0718047526.
