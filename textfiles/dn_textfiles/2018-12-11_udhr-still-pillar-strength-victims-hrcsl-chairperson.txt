UDHR, still a pillar of strength to victims - HRCSL Chairperson

Seven decades on, the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR) still continues to help countless people gain greater freedom and security, help prevent violations, obtain justice for wrongs, and strengthen human rights laws, Human Rights Commission of Sri Lanka (HRCSL) Chairperson Dr. Deepika Udagama said yesterday. Addressing an event to commemorate the 70th Anniversary of the UDHR at the BMICH in Colombo, Dr. Udagama said the importance of UDHR as a tool to protect human rights has grown over the years and today it was more important than ever.
“The UDHR inspire us to continue working to ensure all people can gain freedom, equality and dignity” she said.
Dr. Udagama went on to say that the space dedicated to human rights in all areas should be further enhanced and especially the legal framework to ensure human rights protection should be further strengthened.
Dr. Udagama also recalled the birth of the UDHR where the United Nations Human Rights Commission, under the chairmanship of Eleanor Roosevelt, saw to the creation of the UDHR. Formally adopted by the United Nations on December 10, 1948, it is the most universal human rights document in existence, delineating the thirty fundamental rights that form the basis for a democratic society.
