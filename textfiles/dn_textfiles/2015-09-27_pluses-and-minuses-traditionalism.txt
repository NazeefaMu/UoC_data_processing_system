Pluses and minuses of 'traditionalism'

Despite the widely accepted yet least practiced major religions, South East Asian societies continue to be embroiled in turmoil and turbulence. The widespread loss of civility, the callous disregard for others' feelings, the cunning and manipulation that leads to selfishness and self-centredness, starting from the home with its spill over effects in school and workplace has impacted the social whole, tearing a fabric that once was. The finely woven social tapestry - a great celebration of the past with its custom bound, tradition oriented characteristics in the absence of laws, significantly contributed to social progress.
This then brings to writer's mind the utterance of a respected civilized citizen that said, "we talk of a 2,500 year old civilization of which even remnants do not remain. Buddhism that insists on self annihilation has transformed into self propagation. The much venerated old values - the customs, traditions and what not that made us a noble people have meandered. Take Britain for instance - even their system of governance is based on traditions so much so that she does not have a written constitution. Ask a shop keeper for a copy of Britain's constitution and all what you would get is a loud laugh. But here, with a written constitution and that too subject to so many amendments - surely something has gone wrong somewhere. With a historical record of 2,500 years , it is we who should teach the British of custom and tradition based rule and unwritten constitutions."
Violation of human rights
But then the coin's other side is why such a noble people traversed the world over into conquering lands which itself is a violation of human rights. The native population were victims of stress when they lost what was their own - a lifestyle accustomed to for centuries. Yet, they went through the rigours of what modern health experts call post traumatic stress disorders. What competence was available then to test these disorder levels? It could be argued that we are better off today with an imposed socio, economic, political, cultural, system not to forget a corrupt, post colonial local political hierarchy that has impeded the pace of development in these Asian countries.
If not for the voyages of discovery, colonial empire building itself would have been defunct and the new system introduced into these colonies - an unrealizable task. These voyages that set the stage for an alien system worldwide following newly found geographical entities was more than a milestone in mankind's history. France, Britain, Spain, Portugal, Netherlands led in empire building and their imposed systems that uprooted the indigenous ones in conquered countries created ever widening class disparities. Social frustration was inevitable.
Pre-colonial times
The newly established socio, economic, political, cultural and legal system was not without its accompanying ailments resulting in confusion and chaos. Ironically, Leonard Woolf, himself the crown's representative over here was overwhelmingly saddened by unfolding events in the British administrative system. The rigid impositions, the laws, the statutes and what not he saw as weighing down the typical Sinhala village rustic so accustomed to a relaxed, leisurely, care free lifestyle - all of which Silindu was an embodiment - in Woolf's book 'Village in the Jungle'. Silindu hobbled along struggling to fit in to the newly established system in his native habitat with its unending hiccups. To him it was soul wrenching. What of human rights violations then?
Coupled with this was the entry of ethnicity - a stranger in pre-colonial times. Communal representation for the first time in the legislative council under the British administrative system was mismanaged by the local political elite. In fact ethnicity became the offspring of communal representation and later turned springboard to power installation and extension. Ethnicity was the wellspring for corrupt ultra nationalistic political leadership to win elections in these Asian countries following self-rule that led to the present regional quagmire, needless to speak of religion and the caste based electorate.
Finding fault with the British is ingrained in the national psyche but it needs re-iteration that on the eve of their departure, much to their credit was a sound trade balance they left behind. If discretion was the better part of valour, the political elite in this region could have continued from where they left but as fate mocked, the Asian populace became a destiny driven entity while their greedy leaders began building vast empires for themselves and generations unborn instead of taking off from where the British left, some even projecting themselves as the re-incarnation of their ancient kings. Classing the British administration as being paragons of virtue should not be part of a balanced mind. The pluses and minuses remain.

A scene from the film Baddegama.
People in the lower social order would still have remained there under a caste based society if not for them. Caste then was replaced by class. There came much opportunity for upward social mobility and had caste continued, contemporary socio, political, economic, religious elite would not have found themselves where they are today yet the anti-British cry perpetually persists. As someone said sometime back to such a vociferous crier, "I say, you should be thankful to the Britisher for the trousers you are wearing. Otherwise you would still be in your loin cloth churning pots!"
But regretfully, upward social mobility saw the entry of a value free society as stiff competition for power, position, status and money gripped the social whole. With time's passage, adding fuel to fire as it were, was the effacement of Civics and Ethics from the school curriculum - subjects that moulded the growing mind into all that was elegant and full of finesse.
Financial reservoirs
The liberal market economy in later years also saw sweeping changes in the social landscape. People were further driven to competition. The one time value filled society was uprooted and money over values progressively gained ground. The essence and spirit of religion ceased to be. In every sphere of life, the shell remained while the kernel went missing. Only humans have come to stay, the human being no more. Brick and mortar remain in temple church, kovil and mosque. The congregation warrants soul searching. The politician has come to stay, the statesman no more.
The Asian politician in an ideal state who should have been perfect role model to society knows nothing beyond opulent and ostentatious lifestyles - he, a part of that massive hollow congregation praying steadfastly for election victory and not soul redemption. Anticipating a Joseph Muzica (Uruguay's former simpleton President) from them is akin to seeing feathers in a tortoise.
The bulk in that group became instinctly driven to wallet fattening and continue to remain that way even today with increased intensity at the expense of suffering masses. Foreign bank accounts have swelled into financial reservoirs. Contemporary politics is viewed as 'big business ' - service seemingly a facade. A helpless public became silent onlookers. Significantly, a maturing Asian electorate of late no doubt is a healthy sign where the demand for good governance is a clarion call.
Politicization of government has also led the Asian people into anger and frustration. The respect and regard for politicians is no more as these societies now realize they are a bunch of crooks interested only in personal well-being with exceptions - few and far between.
The only hope then is the right of franchise. But then, here too people remain disgruntled as they see in elections the mere replacement of crooks.
