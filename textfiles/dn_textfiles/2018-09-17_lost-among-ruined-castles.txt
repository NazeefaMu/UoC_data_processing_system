LOST AMONG RUINED CASTLES

Every year I visit Wales and end up at the Dylan Thomas Centre in Upland Swansea much to my brother's annoyance. For me Thomas is as great a writer as Shakespeare and Welsh are rightfully very proud of him.
Beside Thomas, Welsh are very conscious of their heritage hidden among the ruined castles. Why it never occurred me to go on a rampage discovering some, remain a mystery and this time when I did, I was amazed at their rich civilization written on stone, some still standing erect and steady as a witness to their history.
HISTORY BEHIND THE CASTLES
What did I know about them?
Almost nothing: not until I decided to explore one from another with limited time left for me to fly back. Believe me, I was stunned to learn that Wales is full of castles than any other country in the world. This fact alone is ample proof to their rich heritage, especially in line of royalty and great leaders. Wales is an area of land mostly mountainous, fought over by rebels for ten centuries to protect their leaders who dwelled in them. Looking deeper, they are visible remnants of ancient history. Wales is unique in having so many and also preserving their great splendor, beauty and charm in such architectural depths that enhance history-search by scholars, visitors and tourists. No surprise that kings and knights, political and religious leaders flexed their muscles to take control of Wales at different eras and time in history. They certainly would have had architects of high caliber who left their skilled mark on these buildings for us to judge them against the high-tech skyscrapers or revolving towers of today.
What a world.
How it has changed ; amazing and unbelievable.
STOOD THE TEST OF TIME
The true period of building castles covered the years between Norman conquest of the 11th century and the Wars of Roses in the mid-15th century. The first people to experience the resistance of the Wales and discover and the necessity for a system of fortress and communication were the Romans under Scapula who invaded Wales in A.D. 49. As the Roman rule in Britain came to an end, the Saxons were defeated by Arthur to be followed by the Orthodox Christianity brought to England isolating Wales.
Wales stabilized its border in 757 as Danish attacked Britain began, in 851. Began the significant era with the entry of the royals with the Normans under Fitzosbern to South Wales in 160 as William the Conqueror dies in France to be succeeded by William 11. As Henry I comes to the throne of England and Norman domination spreads when Norman bishops replace Welsh in St. David's. Welsh unite to defeat Henry's army but is divided again. In 1189 Richard 1 (Lionheart) is the beginning of the Third Crusade. As Llyelyn attacks border areas, Edward invades Wales and the first Edwardian castles spring up in Wales.
Henry IV is unable to quell Wales rebellion when Sir Henry Percy is killed as rebels hold most of Wales while the French support Wales. With the passing of years, the Wars of the Roses began with Welsh embroiled between but holding on steadily with many kings on throne one after the other keeping Wales out of their reach until in 1642 when Wales support Royalist cause in Civil War.
All this history is wrought in their castles as a testimony to a proud country who passed down the legends what meet our eyes today.
These castles are located to their nearest town or village and their country. Many castles were special for visitors to visit in large numbers who has to be mindful that they are the remains fragmented and isolated. Many are pre-Roman or Roman in origin but are devoid of titles not recognized as castles but equally important to the Welsh history. Every castle I visited had its own special identity, all written on rock and fading wood. Many resembled churches but nowhere near places. Some had vague inscriptions in Welsh. These castles are not monuments in stone as each has a story to tell why it stands tall even today though much literature is not available and some I acquired from a nearly library.
BEAUMARIS CASTLE at Anglessey is on low flat land is the towering grandeur the opportunity to the Master of King's Works the most attractive design which is a classical example of an extremely strong concentric castle. There is a strong balance and proportion with six towers and two powerful gate walls defended by the towering fifteen-foot- thick walls. On appearance, it looks like a fortress. Beaumaris Castle would have daunted even the most unimaginable native attackers. The castle could hold a large garrison. The striking chapel that is vaulted is on the east side.
There were few questions the Welsh failed to understand when it was an anticlimax the Beaumaris castle's formidable defenses were not put to test. May be potential attackers realized they would never succeed and perhaps the castle need never have been built at all. But when the castle was garrisoned for Charles 1, it was held by the Royalists until 1646.
CONWY CASTLE Full of English history, Conwy castle influenced Shakespeare's plays and his characters arose from within its portals especially beginning with the end of Richard 11's reign. I cannot comprehend as to why the Conwy castle had to be in Wales instead of in England. Early in the War of Roses an event occurred which the Welsh took much pleasure in remembering, even though the slain soldier was Welsh. Conwy was the held by Yorkists and facing a probable attack by Lancastrian forces.
For 200 years Conwy Castle's history is undistinguished by events and became gradually more and more dilapidated. So, in 1628 it was sold for a mere £ 100 to Viscount Conwy and this was at a time when many distinguished men were born there. One was John Williams. The Archbishop of York who was much admired by Charles 1.
