Combined efforts to protect jumbos, other animals

The Wildlife officers, Police and Security Forces are to launch combined operations to protect the elephant population and wild animals in forest reserves.
The decision was taken by the Sustainable Development and Wildlife Ministry in the wake of the escalated number of elephant deaths last year.
The strategic plan of carrying out combined operations will be handed over to Sustainable Development and Wildlife Minister Gamini Jayawickrama Perera on January 16. It has been prepared by a committee comprising the representatives of the Wildlife Department, Forest Conservation Department, Mahaweli Authority, Archeological Department, and Police and Security Forces. Its basic plan will be handed over to the minister today.
The plan has been made after careful study of the geographical location of forest reserves, the behaviour of wild animals and other related matter. The plan aims at combating wildlife crimes in a more effective manner.
The Security Forces and Police personnel will conduct the operations in forest reserves subject to the approval of the Director Generals of Wildlife, Forest Conservation and Archeological Departments.
Environmental activists and wildlife enthusiasts raised concerns over the killing of several tuskers in the recent past, including ‘Galgamuwe Dala Poottuwa’. According to the wildlife statistics, 279 elephant deaths had been reported in the island in 2016. A considerable number of elephant deaths occur each year due to gun-shot injuries, hakka patas (explosives), electrocution, poisoning and train accidents.
