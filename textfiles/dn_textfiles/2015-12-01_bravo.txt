Bravo!

The French students of Lyceum International School, Nugegoda were invited by the prestigious Mayo College, Ajmer, Rajasthan, India to participate in their annual French Language Competition.
Various countries competed in the contest and Lyceum International School, Nugegoda was the only school to be invited from Sri Lanka, having satisfied the criteria for the standard of French and the overall standing of the school. Thus five selected students participated in the 'Concours de Francais' which was held recently, in the historic 80 acre campus of Mayo Collage.
The team consisted of Ayesha Hettige, who competed in the category of French Reading and won first place in her category, Nishrin Rieza for poetry recital, Mandira Dissanayake, solo song, Sansindu Abeysuriaya
who competed in the Spelling Bee and Ramith Siriwardana who delivered a declamation on the topic of 'Equality between sexes, myth or reality?'.
The team with their escorting teachers Udeshika Perera and Chamika de Costa were graciously received by the Mayo College students and staff who commented on the good behaviour and social skills of the students as well as their competency levels in French.
As for the students, they gained invaluable experiences, not only in terms of academic advancement, but also by being in a social situation that demanded independence, a sense of responsibility and composure.
