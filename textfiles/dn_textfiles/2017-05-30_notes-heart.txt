Notes from the heart

Down to earth Shashika Nisansala has it all. Success, beauty, talent and commitment. Her journey started around 17 years ago, as a young woman taking part in a singing contest. Her victory at that contest showed her promise and potential.
“I feel that my musical talent is inherent coming from my paternal line. Without my understanding from my youngest days I have been able to sing from the time I could talk. My father too had the inborn ability to sing, but he did not have the opportunity to develop this talent into a vocation, and he was very keen that I really develop my talent and become a professional singer. He did not just want me to become a singer but one who had received training as one. This was his dream.
“My father received his education in the science field, but was not able to realize his own potential to sing due to the fact that he did not have a teacher. And he was not able to really progress in the field and develop his inborn talent. Not only did he have this talent but he had the aptitude of playing musical instruments as well. My father worked as a technical officer in an engineering department. He had this passion and love for music, yet followed a very different path,” said Shashika
Shashika has been influenced by some of the greats in the Sri Lankan Music industry.
“I grew up listening to Sujatha Attanayake’s songs, since I loved that style of music and the timbre of her voice and the lyrics themselves. Then I listened to Deepika Priyadharshani, Nanda Malini and Nirosha Virajini. So I developed a liking for these distinct patterns. At the age of nine or 10 I learnt music as a subject. I have this passion for music which I can only describe as inborn,” stated Shashika
The singing contest Thurunu Shakthi provided the platform for Shashika to rise in the music industry.
“I first properly entered the field of music when I participated in Thurunu Shakthi which was a singing contest which was done by the National Youth Council and Rupavahini in 1999. It featured Lankan singers and songstresses in three stages – District, Regional and National. I came first in Singing. At the district level I performed one of Nirosha Virajini’s songs and I performed one of Sujatha Attanayake’s song at the regional level, and in the finals I got to perform a new song. I did my A/Ls in 2000, and for some time I was involved in exams. Then I did three CDs – Paramita, Nisansala Sandak, Kandulu Bindu. Then I started doing singles, lots of television theme songs and film songs and overall I have sung 220,” explained Shashika
Family has always been a pillar of success for Shashika.
“My biggest strength in life are my parents, it was because of my father’s great interest that I set on this path. My father exposed me a lot to Radio and TV children’s programs by filling in applications so that I could participate in them. I took part in auditions and have taken part in many programs. I have a little brother who is also very supportive of me.
So from my early days up until now my parents have been a great influence and help to me. I received 3 As for my A/Ls and went to Kelaniya. Then I subsequently got married, but in my education and my singing, it has been my parents who have been my rock. Without them I don’t think I would have got this far. They have been like a shadow always present in my life. I got married in 2008 meeting my husband at University. He too is a great help to me. I have two sons. So when I am engaged in my work, it is my parents who take care of the boys. My husband’s name is Suranga. My boys are Mihin, 7 years old and the youngest is Hirun, 3 years,” pointed out Shashika.
Shashika’s magical voice was always created to command the attention and capture the imagination of her fans.
“When I was young, more than become an artiste I wanted to get involved in the field of education. I wanted to be a singing teacher and pass on my knowledge to the next generation. But at the same time having loved listening to songs by Sujatha Attanayake and Nirosha Virajini I had this yearning to sing and put out songs of my own. I wanted to display my talent at singing and make my name known. However I did not have great expectations having no background in music. I did not know anyone in the field and did not have the economic backing to enter the field. But I still had the talent and the luck and this was enough to make me succeed. I also feel that if you can do something well to the best of your abilities, if you have that commitment then along with luck and talent you can really achieve something. After winning Thurunu Shakthi I go invited to act as well. But I did not go into acting since I felt I did not have the aptitude for it and also I was not really interested in it. So I decided to do what I know best which is singing,” elucidated Shashika
Shashika says she has been in the industry for almost 17 years, and she is just getting started.
“I have received more than 15 accolades at prestigious festivals. I am successful because of my training and my whole hearted devotion. I also make many efforts when it comes to my creations. I feel that in the future I can continue to be efficient and successful. From the time I was small I have loved the musical side of life. Even though I am very busy these days with my family I still give have an ear. My singles normally follow the theme of love but up until now I would like to say that my songs are diverse and touch on many themes,” informed Shashika.
A good song is its own reward for Shashika.
“I do not really compete with anyone, I follow my path and sing for my own pleasure and the pleasure of my fans. So the reward I have is their interest and pleasure in my songs and the love I get. So I am under no pressure from the industry. So I am very light hearted and I receive much satisfaction from my vocation. It stimulates and interests me. At concerts I see for myself how much joy people get from my music at indoor shows and open stage shows. I feel the love. It is hard work but no pressure as such,” summed up Shashika.
