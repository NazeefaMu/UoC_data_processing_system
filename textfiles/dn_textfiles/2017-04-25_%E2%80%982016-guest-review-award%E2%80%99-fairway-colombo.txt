‘2016 Guest Review Award’ for Fairway Colombo

The latest entrant in Colombo’s hospitality sector, the Fairway Colombo recently received the ‘2016 Guest Review Award’ by Booking.com.
With an overall score of 9/10, Sri Lanka’s most technologically advanced city hotel is acclaimed to be the property with the best value in Colombo providing guests with more than their money’s worth in comparison to other locations in the city.
Standing at the end of Hospital Street in Fort, the Fairway Colombo fits in perfectly with the colonial façade.
However, upon entrance one is greeted by an entirely modern setting along with the most technologically advanced features. Another prominent feature of the Fairway Colombo is that every process of the hotel is designed not just for the ultimate comfort of guests but also in order to ensure the preservation of the environment and the conservation of energy.
“We have gone to great lengths to ensure that all of the hotel’s activities and various processes are environment friendly. Unlike most hotels, we’re not trying to attract everyone; our goal is to attract a particular group of customers to whom these aspects are important”, explained Imal Fonseka, the Group CEO of Fairway Holdings.
