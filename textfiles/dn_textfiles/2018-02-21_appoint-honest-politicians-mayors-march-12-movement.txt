Appoint honest politicians as Mayors: March 12 Movement

The March 12 Movement yesterday urged all political parties and independent groups to appoint clean, honest and people-oriented politicians as Mayors and Chairmen of Municipal Councils, Urban Councils and Pradeshiya Sabhas. They should be devoid of fraud and corruption charges, the March 12 Movement asserted.
Free and Fair Election (PAFFREL) Executive Director Rohana Hettiarachchi said the March 12 Movement has been informed that certain political parties were trying to appoint corrupt candidates who are facing legal action. This is completely wrong,” he said.
“We have urged all political parties to submit the parameters for selecting candidates for local government bodies before the election. However, political parties have not followed such parameters.”
This election has not selected candidates according to the requirements of voters. The voters have cast their votes as it was a General Election.
They had not been aware of qualifications and the real situation of candidates, he said.
