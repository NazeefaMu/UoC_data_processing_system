Season for rankings, Asian targets and Achilles heel that looms

The month of Augustus has its own historical milestones of epic proportions...most significant of all being Roman Emperor Augustus Caesar and his blind ambition to rule the known world.
So it follows that August is known for its conquests and particularly a grand series of remarkable resistance by Queen Cleopatra the Great and her beloved Eygyptian.
For us Asians in Sri paradise the imposing Asian Games has its confrontation with destiny ...as we speak.
The island’s biggest contingent, hoping to conquer Asia and write our own history.
Standing tall at the head of that front line...Sri Lanka rugby 7s unit led by the hardworking Muthutanthri and a fair chunk of experience.
The sharp footed Sooriyabandara, the efficient finisher Danush Ranjan, the maestro man Jason Dissa, reliable Gayan Weeraratne, impact Ritchie Dharma....hard hitting Omalka Gunarat, pace Kavinda and creative Dixon.
These are our 7s gladiators who wish to carve their own history...defy science and command respect in the middle.
Between them and a podium finish...Japan, Hong Kong, Korea, and possibly China.
Our medal finish very much on the radar and about time.
Coach Woods simply confident, happy with the quality of this unit and hoping for the best Sri performance in history.
Those thoughts hugely echoed by all the rugby mad hearts islandwide.
What a grand prospect indeed.
We are certainly looking forward to an inspired tour by these Sri gladiators.
Realistically...a little concern about the Korean match is gnawing away...that is natural and needs correction.
Enough banter and blah, blah about this Korean Achilles heel...let the boys sort it out in the middle, and stamp their class upfront on day 1. The expectations are bubbling given that huge bubble in Hong Kong where I certainly believed that Sri Lanka belonged in the final of the U20 7s...coming 3rd was acceptable but surprising to Naveen H and the lads...how Korea outran us in extra time and only 6 on the park.
Similar echoes in Indonesia that need shutting up against Korea.
The Asian Games is the toughest litmus tester for all ARFU member countries this season and hopes of grading up for a World Series shot. A dream that needs action and results not words ....most significantly for us Sri islanders.
Looking beyond in September...it’s the 3rd leg ARFU 7s series and another chance with that ranking pendulum.
Both men and women prep mind and body for the battles ahead.
At this pertinent juncture...why aren’t our women, currently 6th in Asia ...not at the Asian Games?
The men are 4th and adjusting to Indonesian delights...the women missing out for reasons concealed in some cheap file, stacked in the visa requests and other annoying red tape for the Asian games trip. Given our skills and natural talent capabilities ...Sri rugby...now in the hands of Bonsa, Dida Illyas, Nazeem Mohamed....well understand the priorities to be anxious about travelling our teams as much as possible.
Experience is from more time in the middle, against the best in Asia and beyond.
Time to shed the psychological burden of the big country mindset label....
Learn from Kenya…USA...Samoa, Canada and the selfbelief that gives them big impressive reps upfront, and staggering performance that stun the senses.
Sri Lanka needs this 7s magic full time ...and like our Fijian island brothers and sisters....
Eat… breathe..walk..talk..sleep..absorb..digest....believe and live this 7s lifestyle.
Let’s go Sri Lanka ..let’s give our fellow island nations around planet rugby....something permanent to be proud of.
Bula bula Sri 7s Lanka.
Blessings for teams and the flag.
