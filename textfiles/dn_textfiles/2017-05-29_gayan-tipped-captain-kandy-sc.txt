Gayan tipped to captain Kandy SC

Center-three-quarter Gayan Weeraratne is expected to captain Kandy Sports Club in the upcoming 2017/18 rugby season.
He replaces his brother Roshan Weeraratne who captained Kandy SC to the triple crown – league, knockout and sevens last season.
The new season is due to commence in October. Gayan is a product of Kingswood College, and straight from school he joined the Nittawela club. He has played for both junior and senior national teams. He missed the Asia division I tournament which was held in Malaysia due to an injury.
