Igniting young minds

Sri Lanka needs a boon in technology associated spheres to facilitate the country that is on fast track towards sustainable development. Young and innovative scientists are the backbone of this endeavour.
Our country has been deprived of scientists and innovators over the decades due to brain draining but now we cannot afford to let that happen anymore.
The Ministry of Science, Technology and Research is engaged in a long term program to groom local scientists in a methodological manner. The program spearheaded by the National Science Foundation (NSF) under the patronage of Minister Susil Premjayantha is in the process of identifying budding scientists at school level to be groomed as fully fledged scientists.
Scientific projects
Subodhi Institute at Moratuwa glittered with these promising scientists on January 17, 18 and 19. Around 70 Advanced Level students representing 16 schools too part at a residential training program. They were the semi finalists shortlisted from representatives of 800 schools in the preliminary rounds who presented their scientific projects.
Residential training sessions took place with the supervision of the NSF towards identifying innovative scientific projects. Viable and novel scientific projects that are selected and patented would be showcased at the International Science and Engineering Fair aka INTEL ISEF 2017 that will be held in the United States.
Out of 55 research projects presented at Subodhi Institute by the semi finalists, 10 were shortlisted. It is significant that two research projects presented by Dehiwala S de S Jayasinghe Central College students are within the 10 selected projects. Four students who championed the two projects, Ravindra Sankalpa, Mohomad Musthak, Shehan Kavishka and Mohomad Asri, rejoiced by their achievements, spoke to the Daily News.
Mohomad Musthak and Mohomad Asri were the first to speak on their project titled ‘Waste to Wealth’. “There are acres of lands that are not suitable for cultivation since the compositions of these soils are salty.
Unfertile soil
We submitted a proposal to NSF that carried a biological method to change compositions of such unfertile soil to make them viable for cultivation. The green light was given by NSF with necessary support to carry out the project. Prof Meththika Vithanage at National Institute of Fundamental Studies guided us,” said Musthak.
Mohamad Asri spoke next.
“After browsing the internet and reading various science books we encountered chemical and physical methods to change the composition of soils. But these expensive methods also have detrimental after-effects such as killing insects living in these soils that are vital to keep the soil alive. Hence we looked for an alternate cheaper method,” he said.
“We researched for a cost effective and hassle-free method suitable for a developing country like ours. Bio char and compost gave us the solution. Bio-char is a waste product of Thermal Power Plants that come in bulk and compost can be made by any household. We used these two natural attributes and made a solution that can change the composition of salty soil to make it viable for cultivation. It has no after effects too. Our country can use this method to enhance cultivation that will contribute towards the growth in GDP” concluded Musthak.
Ravindu Sankalpa and Shehan Kavishka who have championed the second research project, ‘Micro and Nano engineering for Waste Water’ spoke next. “Prevention is better than cure was the theme of our project. It is much better to eliminate the sources of cancer rather than finding cures. One out of seven deaths in the world today are due to cancer.
Nano technology
One major source of cancer is the highly poisonous Cr(V1) aka Chromium Six iron that comes in waste water from factories. We researched to make waste water free of this element,” said Ravindu. “We made use of secondary data to find necessary information. We used Nano technology coupled with Bio-char to find a magnetic solution to kill Cr (VI) iron in waste water from factories. Prof Meththika Vithanage and Gayani Samarasinghe, our school science teacher guided us towards finding this valuable solution,” added Shehan.
These students of Dehiwala S de S Jayasinghe Central College said they are proud to be Sri Lankans. They paid gratitude to their school Principal P P D C Pathirana who gave his blessings and encouraged them to indulge in research studies. Cost effective and hassle free scientific methods such as these would definitely help Sri Lanka boost its productivity. The significance of this event is that such findings are being done by school children.
The Government should invite the private sector to join hands in assisting these resourceful youngsters to excel as scientists by offering them with scholarships.
