Navy-Havies game evenly poised

It will be an exciting tussle for supremacy when Navy SC lock horns with their arch rivals Havelock’s Sports Club in the semi final of the Dialog ‘A’ Division inter club knock out rugby tournament at Race Course grounds in Colombo today. kick off will be at 4.00 pm.
Going by how the two teams faired this season, both teams have a definite chance of pulling this game through and this makes the event a thrilling tussle.
In this years just concluded league rugby tournament Navy won the first leg
by beating the Havies at Welisara. But it was the Park Club which won the second leg by 16 points to 11 played at Havelock Park. The lads from Welisara were really fortunate and just managed to beat the gallant Shamly Nawaz’s fighting Police SC by 43-36 in their quarter final clash played at Race Course grounds last week after a close game.
Adding to the woes for Navy would be the absence of their two key players in captain cum flanker Danushka “Gerthe” Perera and winger Supun Dilshan from today’s semi final due to reasons best known to them.
However the Sailors will have a huge advantage when it comes to the two hookers, where in form Dulanjana Wijesinghe will strike it very much faster
and will be the man to watch in the lose play than the Havies hooker Shameer Fajudeen.
Mean while the Park Club boys who won their semi finals with Army Sports Club last week, have the presence of a sturdy set of forwards who are capable of pulling the game in their favour will have to play a vital role in today’s game as well along with their speedy three quarter line spearheaded by their play maker former Peterite vice captain and the present national centre Nishone Perera manage to deliver the goods, then it will be a daunting task for the Navy team to counter attack to make a much needed victory to get in to the all important finals.
Navy won this tournament last under the captainsy of Rohitha “Chichi” Rajapaksa way back in 2014.
