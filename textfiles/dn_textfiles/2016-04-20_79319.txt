Gammanpila objects to Ranawaka’s place in Constitutional Council

Pivithuru Hela Urumaya Leader Udaya Gammanpila strongly objects to Megapolis and Western Development Minister Patali Champika Ranawaka not being removed from the Constitutional Council, despite having four ongoing police investigations.
“Not just us, even the Joint Opposition requested the President to remove Ranawaka from the Constitutional Council. Now we doubt if the investigations of Sandeep Sampath Gunawardena, the victim of the hit-and-run accident allegedly committed by Minister Ranawaka, will be carried out unbiased by the Police Department. We are wondering if the present IGP owes Ranawaka anything in return for his appointment,” he said.
“For once, the fate of Jayasundera was in Ranawaka’s hands. Now the fate of Ranawaka is in the hands of Jayasundera,” he said.
Gammanpila said that by including suspects in the Constitution Council the government and has shaken the faith placed in them by the public:
“This shatters the hopes of the public who voted for the present government to come into power,” he said.
