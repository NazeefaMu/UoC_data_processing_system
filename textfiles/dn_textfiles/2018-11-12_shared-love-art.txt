Shared love for art

The second annual exhibition of the Piyawara Artists Group will be held on November 17 and 18 at the Lionel Wendt Art Gallery. Following the success of their first exhibition held last year, where a group of art lovers from different walks of life and ages got together to paint under the guidance of their teacher, Ruwan Prasanga at the Artway Institute will hold their second exhibition.
These artists paint as a hobby and have different interests and styles of painting ranging from impressionism to realism, abstract, still life and wildlife. This enthusiastic group is looking forward to exhibiting their creations at the Lionel Wendt for all art lovers.
