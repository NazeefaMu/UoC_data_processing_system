Trained Sri Lankan  workers leave for Japan

The first Sri Lankan batch of trained workers left for Japan yesterday after meeting with Telecommunications and Digital Infrastructure minister Harin Fernando.
Accordingly, two trained Sri Lankans departed for Japan after receiving extensive residential training at Ratnapura. This programme is a joint collaboration with the IM Japan Company.
Minister Harin Fernando said this project is conducted by the Sri Lanka Bureau of Foreign Employment free of charge. “There is a popular hoax that contractors and agents who ask for money in return for providing jobs in Japan and we urge the public not to be deceived. Only an N4 level proficiency of the Japanese language is needed,” the Minister said.
“We already face issues with untrained workers in the Middle East who undergo many hardships. However, this programme conducted with Japanese collaboration creates an opportunity for us to send trained workers. The basic monthly salary the workers would receive will be 146,000 Yen. The Sri Lanka Bureau of Foreign Employment has already established residential training centers at Ratnapura and Tangalle,” Minister Fernando said.
“Any citizen of the country between the ages of 18 to 30 with an N4 level or higher language proficiency of Japanese is eligible to work in Japan. The Memorandum of Understanding signed between the Foreign Employment Bureau of Japan and IM Japan Company offers unlimited job opportunities in Japan in the nursing sector. The applicants must spend 13 years in school while an Advanced Level examination qualification is not compulsory. The applicants should also not be less than 5 feet in height and should possess strong sight. If an applicant satisfies these requirements he/she will be provided four months residential training in Japanese language proficiency,” Sri Lanka Bureau of Foreign Employment Deputy General Mnager Mangala Randeniya said.
He further stated that the trained workers will have to work for three years on contract basis with the possibility of extending the period for another two years. If a worker wishes to return to the country and start an investment of their own, the Japanese company would fund that investment up to 1 million yen.
