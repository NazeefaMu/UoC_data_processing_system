Havies are looking forward to regain League rugby title

Havelock Sports Club founded in 1915 is a Division ‘A’ rugby union team based in Sri Lanka that plays in the Dialog Rugby League. The Club has a long history and Rugby is the club’s main sporting activity.
The “Havies”, as they are commonly known amongst its members, is situated in Colombo and the club’s ground is known as Havelock Park. The club has produced some excellent players over the last few decades including Sri Lankan Nationals such as Michael Jayasekera, Hisham Abdeen, Graham Raux, Sanjeewa Jayasinghe and Rajeev Ganapathy.
The club has struggled over the last decade to retain its players with their star performer’s crossing over to more star-powered clubs. They were once down and out even to find 15 players to represent the club rugby side but Stormed in to recognition in 2012/13 season with the help of several ex CR and FC players together with the guidance of knowledgeable Samoan coach Tevita Tulagaise affectionately called as Laga to all his close friends by winning the coveted league Crown under prop forward Terence Henry after a lapse of almost close to four decades.

They beat the defending champions at that time the formidable Kandy Sports Club, who were the champions for the preceding 10 years.
The brain child behind this famous victory is none-other than ex CR and FC stalwart Asanga Seneviratne who suddenly took over Havies that year and within the period of three to four months transformed a ordinary bunch of players to a fighting unit, capable of giving a fight to other top clubs such as CR and FC, Navy and Kandy by being a dominant force in local rugby arena.
Seneviratne, who is the current head of the Sri Lanka Rugby Football Union, has changed the face of Havies Rugby over the last several years by helping them find sponsors through companies he controls, which has helped lift the standards of the club on-field and off-field.
A new stadium has been built with games being played under lights. Sri Lankan national prop forward Dushmantha Priyadarshana will captain the Havelocks SC this upcoming 2016/17 season in the Dialog league rugby tournament and the Clifford cup knock out championship.
While the club has drafted in the vastly experienced former national Coach Ronnie Ibrahim as the head coach of the team in this year’s rugby season, Sri Lanka national players of the caliber of Diren Warnakulasuriya, Ganuka Dissanayaka and Danushka Ranjan have left the club and joined Kandy SC and Police SC respectively while national captain Sudarshana Muthutantri has not turn out for practices yet at Havelock’s this season.
There’s a good news for Havies as former Havies, Navy SC, Police SC and national Winger Chamara Dabare has returned to his old club and Navy SC and Sri Lanka national third row forward Yoshitha Rajapaksha along with ex Isipahana and Police SC nippy scrum half Sudam Sooriarachchi also has joined the club and will most probably play for the pink and chocolate Jersey’s this season.
Havelocks Squad: Dushmantha Priyadarshana (Captain), Vimukthi Rahula, Ramesh Fernando, Chamara Dabare, Kevin Dixon, Hirantha Perera, Dulaj Perera, Shehan Dias, Devinda Pathiranage, Senal Deelaka, Lasindu Karunathilaka, Ashwanth Herath, Ganidu Lakshan, Sharo Fernando, Mithun Hapugoda, Chamika Kusal, Prasath Madhushanka, Ijaaz Ahamed, Liston Flalny, Salinda Chamara, Viraj Fernando, Ashan Darling, Jason Melder, Hafiz Adahan, Udara Anjana, Niroshan Fernando, Rohitha Rajapakse, Nishon Perera, Samantha Lakshan.
Havies will come out for the first time this season against the formidable Air Force side on Saturday the 5th November at 4.00pm in Air Force grounds in Ratmalana.
