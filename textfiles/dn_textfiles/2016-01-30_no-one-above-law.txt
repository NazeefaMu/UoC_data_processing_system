No one is above the law

'A Judge needs courage. Judges with courage resist threats to judicial independence and actively advocate such. We must foster a culture that support and rewards courageous judges.' Duhaime's very profound yet 'gone out of gear' utterance in the Sri Lankan context was brought to this writer's mind when the Homagama Magistrate made a rather unusually bold pronouncement that the army commander would be arrested should he interfere in the case of journalist Eknaligoda's investigations.
At the time these lines are being penned, Judge Dissanayake has resorted to a moral explosion again in ordering the arrest of BBS kingpin Galagoda Aththe Gnanasara Thera.
In a country of fallen standards, eroding values and very lackadaisical unprofessional behaviour, this judicial brilliance deserves nothing less than a standing ovation for it endangers his life and it comes as a result of selflessness. Finding such professional eminence in this country is akin to getting a needle off a haystack going by the moral deviance which has been our 'feed' since the so-called dawn of independence.
Very often we hear at seminars and workshops, failed, retired government servants' famous escape line,"what to do. I was helpless in the matter. There was no alternative for me except to agree." This no doubt is to make 'chicken feed' of one's self to the deities of power. Contrastingly, the Homagama Magistrate risks not only his bread and life but his family's as well. Media concern over such is poor as Presidents, Ministers, Prime Ministers, bomb explosions, how many killed and how many wounded are prioritized for public consumption. Sensational journalism and elitist journalism go to fill newspaper pages while very little or no effort at all is the unfair share allocated to developmental journalism. The Magistrate's story falling into the last category which should have been prime media pick for at least a few days, did not get the attention it so richly deserves.
Magistrate's bold and upright stand
Failure on the part of media warrants public participation in the matter. Protest marches alone would not suffice. Highlighting individual performance of professional brilliance in public interest is absolutely nil in this country as evident in the magistrate's bold and upright stand and the media's failure to centerpiece its significance does not augur well. Had civil society gone to town in highlighting that kind of legal brilliance, the message of what the public expect from professionals would have rung out in no mean way.
This is not to underestimate the effort, even though of late, the positive street protests so far unheard of in this country in the face of what is irregular. The rise of civil society and the awakening of academics are contributory factors in spearheading yahapalanaya. Renowned Sinhala scholar Professor Sarath Wijeysuriya on whom the leadership mantle of the National Movement for Social Justice fell, following Ven. Sobitha Thera's demise, has done well in expressing certain unpalatable views, of course with some back patting when needed. Professor Siri Hettige on whom the spotlight falls for moral clearance of police discrepancies maintains he would rather go home than be seen pushed around by political nincomputes. "In fairness to them this has not happened so far and I'm still around," he says. Contrastingly, G.L. Peiris was a total moral failure for his servility in upholding a corrupt status quo. Not even a semblance of intellectual brilliance was to his credit though ironically a Rhodes scholar _ silence being his preferred state in instances of misdemeanour.
The people's sovereignty is upheld when a public servant challenges administrative irregularities _ it's realization only possible in an environment of freedom as we find now. For how long the newly found freedom will continue, only time will tell. Yet this alone will not suffice. Public servants challenging the status quo need to be appreciated though a leading academic saw it as worthless upon which this writer asked him whether to appreciate is not part of a cultured mind. My question only met with a deafening silence.
Judicial supremacy
One single swallow does not make a summer. Nevertheless, that a single whistle blower's inspiration would signal many others' entry into the moral domain is well worth waiting in anticipation. However, devoid of civil society and media interest in the matter, a positive outcome is least expected. Yet, an essential component in activating civil society is the media _ the prime informing agent.
The much preferred line of traditional media gurus of the orthodox, conventional, outdated brigade was, "when dog bites man it is not news but when man bites dog it is news." Yet who chews what was regrettably not of their concern. A constant thirst for sensationalism of a negative nature was their taste and delight but not so the focus into a moral society. We have not come very far in changing the face of modern journalism into a proactive, vibrant state. The old mentors' theories still do languish without any effort into media vibrancy. If it was so, Judge Dissanayake's judicial chivalry would not be at a dead end.
Some may feel as did that academic pundit, that the gentleman Judge was merely doing his duty and there was no need for such acts to be highlighted. Perhaps, 'yes' in countries where high standards are upheld, Judge Dissanayake's act is a common occurrence and media exposure is redundant. Yet, in many Asian countries including Sri Lanka such whistle blowing needs much trumpeting for their indefatigable capacity in the realms of corruption and other moral deviance.
In India and Pakistan, judicial swiftness has even prime caused into bringing down powerful governments. India's one time Chief Justice Bhagwati's contribution in torch bearing an evolved judiciary in that country is not unknown. In a Colombo based gathering 20 years ago where the large numbers present outdid the hall's physical space, he spoke on the spirit of the law so far unheard of in this country.
Had Neville Samarakoon, one time chief justice been living, Judge Dissanyake's judicial valour would have come in for much praise. Samarakoon, though J.R. Jayewardene's choice into that seat, refused the latter's summoning to be at Braemar and insisted the president meet him instead. Those were the high standards he maintained in judicial supremacy.
Politicians will always be in disrepute for their inability to win public confidence. Take for instance nepotism or family bandyism. Politicians are inclined into it because of the callous disregard for feelings of the country's citizenry. They will unceasingly remain corrupt which is why people disregard them as a bunch of crooks. Elections and a change of government is not the way out.
If so who will beard the lion in it's den. The three pronged attack rests with a fearless judiciary, a vibrant civil society and a team of enlightened academics who will demand from the lawmakers who have fallen from grace into being law breakers, good governance and righteous rule to rid this country from the labyrinth of disaster.
Judge Dissanayake no doubt has made a good start and the public surely will regain their lost confidence in the judiciary. His ruling as against Sarath Silva the former Chief Justice whose judgemental favour towards Rajapaksa was public confession sometime back, erodes people's faith in the judiciary. Gnanasara Thera was right when he spoke of the law's unequal treatment, but he chose the wrong venue to argue a strong point. He ought to have known better.
