Lottery agents’, sellers’ boycott continues

Lottery agents boycotted sales for a second consecutive day yesterday over an alleged government move to increase the lottery price from Rs. 20 to Rs. 30.
Lottery sellers held protests as well in several areas against the alleged decision and demanding a higher commission.
Earlier the all Ceylon Lottery Dealers Association (ACLDA) threatened to withdraw from sales if the government decides to increase the price.
Media reports said the tickets of the National Lotteries Board (NLB) and the Development Lotteries Board (DLB) will be increased by Rs.10.
Reports said the Finance Ministry was contemplating increasing lottery prices to cover losses and increase NLB and DLB profits. The ACLDA, however, says if prices are increased, the sales will be severely affected.
ACLDA sources said a protest will be held in Fort today against the decision.
