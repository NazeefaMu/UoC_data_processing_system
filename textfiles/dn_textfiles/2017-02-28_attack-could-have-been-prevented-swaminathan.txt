Attack could have been prevented : Swaminathan

Prisons Reforms, Rehabilitation, Resettlement and Hindu Religious Affairs Minister D.M.Swaminathan yesterday said that the attack on the Prisons bus would not have happened if the Police had provided special security as requested by the Prisons officials.
The Minister added that prisons officials had sought Police security before the suspects were taken to be produced before the Kaduwela Magistrate court. “Police said that they could not comply with the Prisons officials request due to lack of manpower,” the Minister said.
He added that prisons officials seek additional security from the Police Department, when special kind of inmates such as underworld gangsters are being taken to courts.
Prisons officials had deployed an extra bus to provide special security for these inmates as the Police refused to provide security due to lack of personnel.
