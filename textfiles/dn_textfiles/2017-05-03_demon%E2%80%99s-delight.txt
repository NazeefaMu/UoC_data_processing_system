Demon’s delight

Bringing horror factor to the big screen had been a challenge to filmmakers from the inception of world cinema. Cinema personalities like Peter Cushing with Christopher Lee and Alfred Hitchcock to name a few brought horror and suspense to cinema in a credible manner.
This trend was brought forward for decades by filmmakers by inducing profound attributes to the subject. With the dawn of digital era, horror films were taken to a different level with the use of gripping special effects.
Sri Lankan cinema too from its inception used horror factor to entertain masses though in tiny proportions. In early Sinhala films the element of horror only came in few scenes to add spice to the main story. Fully fledged Sinhala horror films like Zoom, Maya and were made only in recent times.
Bandhanaya a 3D horror film directed by Udayakantha Warnasuriya is the latest one adding to the list.
Bandhanaya has a story woven around hostility between two closely related families living in a remote village. Differences are created within these families over inheritance of ancestral property. Two cousins, Dingirala and Menikhami who have mastered the art of dealing with the occult thus become archrivals.
Menikhami using black magic creates a Pilliya (zombie) to kill his cousin Dingirala. Rift between the two families heightens. The little child in one family becoming victim of circumstances is possessed by a ferocious demon and the need for an exorcism arises.
Udayakantha Warnasuriya is an artiste who seeks to bring novelty to his creations whether it is cinema or painting. He makes films of different genres and Bandhanaya is his first horror film. Making Bandhanaya as a black and white 3D film is significant. Warnasuriya has given a special treatment to the film by associating with local folklore that talk of Yakkas or demons as Maha Sona and including witchcraft, black magic, possession and exorcism in the screenplay.
High expectations were set prior to releasing of the film and the film trailer that was mind blowing too aroused interest of filmgoers.
But did the film live up to the anticipated level? The story unfolds on screen lacks the most important ingredient in a horror film which is, igniting the horror factor. Thus whether the film lived up to the expectations of viewers is questionable.
First half of the film flows credibly keeping the viewers intact and making them wonder…what will happen next. Witchcraft performed by Menikhami at the cemetery is shot extremely well and projected with much credibility and those scenes keep viewers absorbed to the film with much eagerness.
Special effects used in these scenes are very appropriate and they add immense value to the eerie scenes. Apparition of the demon Maha Sona is projected credibly in these scenes with special effects, doing justice to this unusual and mega powerful phenomenon.
Folklore describes Maha Sona otherwise known as Ritigala Jayasena as a ferocious and gargantuan demon that is taller than a coconut tree and having a cranium of a wild bear turned backwards.
Second half of Bandhanaya deals with the possessed child and exorcisms performed to make her sober. Scenes involving the processed child may remind someone of the Hollywood film, ‘The Exorcist’ screened decades back. Bandhanaya story starts losing its credibility and the ‘local touch’ here.
The director in the final scenes brings Maha Sona to life and makes a mere mortal (Hemal Ranasinghe) wrestle with this extraordinary demon. Once projected big, Maha Sona in the final scenes of the film thus becomes a phenomenon like Gopalu Yaka in Warnasuriya’s film Ran Kevita.
Adding more damage to this the makeup artiste drastically fails to create the physical formation of Maha Sona. Poor physical outlook of the demon has directly contributed towards tarnishing credibility brought to the same character with special effects in the early scenes.
However sound effects, special effects and music scores elevate the film to a healthier platform. Cinematography of Bandhanaya is credible but the frames capturing gestures of the possessed child seem copied from Hollywood films like The Exorcist or The Forest.
Projecting the demon’s eye view of humans in a novel manner as if looked from a different dimension showcases excellent creativity by the director Warnasuriya.
Veteran actor Syril Wickramage as Menikhami does his part so well that no viewer may think he is acting. Priyankara Ratnayake and Ravindra Yasas too have understood their parts well and brought in credible performances.
Hemal Ranasinghe with his performance in Bandhanaya proves he can pump life to any character coming his way, be it an urbanized citizen or a village folk. Dulani Anuradha seems casted wrong for the character and her distracted performance throughout the film hinder credibility of other performances. Nilmini Tennakoon and Suvinitha Weerasinghe do not have characters to play thus they become passengers or glamour girls.
End scene of the film is very similar to a Hollywood horror film.
All-in-all Bandhanaya could be treated a horror film with a difference made with a screenplay that involves Sri Lankan folklore. However the screenplay having a very local touch in the start deviates from that midway losing momentum and paving way for a less credible creation.
Thus, what would have been a monumental film in the Sri Lankan film history finally becomes yet another horror movie mainly for the reasons, using Hollywood tactics and weaknesses in the screenplay.
