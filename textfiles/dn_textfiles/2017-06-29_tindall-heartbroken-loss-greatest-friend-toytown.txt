Tindall heartbroken at loss of 'greatest friend' Toytown

London: Queen Elizabeth II's granddaughter Zara Tindall says she is 'heartbroken' at the death of Toytown, the horse she combined with to win European and world three day eventing individual titles.
Toytown, believed to be 25, had to be put down on Tuesday for medical reasons drawing the emotional statement from Tindall, who under her maiden name Phillips rode Toytown to European individual and team gold in 2005 and then world individual glory in 2006.
They won another European team gold in 2007 but injury prevented him from appearing at both the 2004 and 2008 Olympic Games -- he eventually retired from competition in 2011.
"I'm heartbroken to say that yesterday morning (Tuesday) I had to say goodbye to my greatest friend and horse of a lifetime, Toytown," read her statement.
"He was the most incredible athlete with the biggest heart, European and World champion back to back.
"He made my career and I couldn't be more grateful to him for the amazing times we had together. He was a huge part of my family, an amazing animal and a true champion.
"I will miss you forever." AFP
