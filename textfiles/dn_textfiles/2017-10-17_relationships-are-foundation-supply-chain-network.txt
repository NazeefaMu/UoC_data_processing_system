Relationships are the foundation of Supply Chain Network

Business-to-business (B2B or, in some countries, BtoB) refers to a situation where one business makes a commercial transaction with another.
This typically occurs when a business is sourcing materials for their production process (e.g. a food manufacturer purchasing salt) a business needs the services of another for operational reasons (e.g. a food manufacturer employing an accountancy firm to audit their finances) a business re-sells goods and services produced by others (e.g. a retailer buying the end product from the food manufacturer).
B2B is often contrasted against business-to-consumer (B2C). In B2B commerce it is often the case that the parties to the relationship have comparable negotiating power, and even when they don't, each party typically involves professional staff and legal counsel in the negotiation of terms, whereas B2C is shaped to a far greater degree by economic implications of information asymmetry.
So, what happened? Online exchanges are based on the notion that procurement can be made significantly easier, more efficient, and less expensive. A buyer would simply place an order online, let the various suppliers submit their prices, and wait for the lowest bid to come in. What folks forgot in the B2B craze, however, is that, while price is an important factor in purchasing materials for production, qualities other than price matter too in fact, they don’t just matter, they often matter more.
The consultancy Accenture most of companies corporate buyers and found that the thought that a strong brand and reliable customer service both were more important than low prices when it came to making purchases online.
The near-fatal flaw in online B2B exchanges was that planners and prognosticators ignored the importance of relationships up and down the supply chain. Purchasers don’t just look for the best price. They seek out suppliers that can offer the total package top-quality products, reliable delivery, a high level of customer service, and the ability to customize orders to meet specific needs.
They look for the total cost of ownership for the goods and services they’re buying, not just the purchase price of the product. Indeed, the most successful B2B relationships are those in which two companies develop a deep understanding of each other’s processes and procedures. In this way, they can expand the relationship even to the point of including collaboration in R&D or product design.
This partnership allows the two parties to focus on their strengths and to increase overall efficiencies. Under these circumstances, value is derived from suppliers that can provide the total package. In the past two decades, buyers and sellers have worked hard to develop such relationships with each other. Over time, many of these relationships have blossomed into fullblown strategic partnerships, where the buyers and sellers collaborate on a wide range of activities, such as information systems, capital investments, and product design. It has become clear that relationships matter in the traditional supply chain and are likely to be one of the defining factors of the evolving demand network.
The relationship imperative: The need for flexibility
Flexibility the ability to respond quickly to changing needs in a dynamic competitive environment is critical for firms that want to succeed in the demand network. Production cycles are getting shorter as consumers demand greater variety in products and services all the time. In order to meet this demand, firms all along the supply chain are looking for flexibility from suppliers. They need to be able to adapt production processes quickly and refine the features of a product based on consumer feedback (sometimes in the middle of a run). Often they require customized service to accommodate complex and unique needs. For example, in the high-tech manufacturing sector, products like routers and switches are being designed on the fly, with product specifications being continuously updated and modified to improve performance. New technologies are making this type of flexibility possible, but even more important are the relationships between the manufacturers and the buyers. These two entities must be fully committed to sharing information and working cooperatively to make such radical improvements in the production process.
External relationships proliferate: Outsourcing
A major transformation in the supply chain took place around 1970, when large multinational corporations began moving activities previously performed in-house to outside companies. The rigid vertical structure of early. Mass-production manufacturers, like Ford, that once owned their entire supply chain from parts to assembly to distribution, began to break down. Instead of making parts themselves, such companies began to rely on outside suppliers that could produce certain components faster, cheaper, or better. Many of these suppliers were located in low-cost regions in other countries, particularly Southeast Asia and, to some extent, Latin America. Outsourcing activity accelerated in the 1980s and 1990s as the supplier firms themselves achieved scale and became increasingly competitive with the large firms that would soon become their customers. Large networks of supplier firms emerged, each of which supplied multiple firms. Reductions in transportation costs and information costs enabled these networks of suppliers to become efficient on a global scale. As a result, the supply chain became global and involved many different players to produce a single product. Corporations outsourced an increasing percentage of steps along the supply chain as firms experienced the benefits of efficiency and flexibility that outsourcing provided.
Taking it to the limit: Total outsourcing
In the 1990s, outsourcing not only grew in intensity, but it also began to spread in scope creating the infrastructure upon which the demand network is now evolving. Firms began outsourcing large parts of the manufacturing process to outside vendors. Some firms went as far as outsourcing all their manufacturing operations. The consumer electronics industry is particularly well suited for total outsourcing. Contract manufacturers in this industry, such as Solectron, Orders for its products go to one of its fulfillment partners, such as Modus Media Incorporated, which handle inventory. Brand-name consumer products companies that espouse this model, such as Ericsson, Phillips, and Sony, are becoming vastly different entities. The core of their business is now centered on innovation and marketing rather than production and assembly. As the consumer electronics industry seems particularly well suited to pushing the outsourcing model to its extreme, it is also acting as a model that other industries will soon follow. A look at the diversity of the company’s customer base suggests that industries other than consumer electronics are actively outsourcing their manufacturing as well.
Three tiers of relationships
Not all relationships are likely to be as extreme as in the total outsourcing model. In fact, a spectrum of relationships is emerging based on the strength and nature of the points of connection in the network. The information with supply chain experts identified three tiers of relationships between buyers and suppliers, each with different degrees of true partnership:
• Commodity relationships, which involve sellers that provide the lowest-cost goods to meet a buyers’ needs; these relationships can be fairly anonymous, and there is little to no real partnership or information sharing.
• Basic relationships, in which some information is shared between the parties to ensure cost-effective outcomes, but full partnerships are neither expected nor desired.
• Strategic partnerships, which imply a long term relationship with the suppliers that are most important to the buyer’s operation, in which buyers and sellers work cooperatively and share information extensively to achieve shared goals.
Tier 1: Commodity relationships
While we are focusing on the importance of relationships in the supply chain, it is important to note that not all transactions conducted must involve complex interactions. Some inputs are simple exchanges of commodities, such as raw materials and common maintenance items, or basic services like cargo transport, in which the most important factor is price. Who the supplier is matters far less than the cost of the product and perhaps the delivery schedule. B2B exchanges and auctions can play a role here. When price and a reasonable delivery time are what matter most, a B2B exchange can facilitate fairly anonymous and efficient transactions that save the buyer time and money. Of course, these exchanges may also help some companies find suppliers with whom they want to build deeper relationships after the initial transaction. Online exchanges can bring formerly unknown suppliers into the buyer’s world, increasing the pool of potential partners.
Tier 2: Basic relationships
In the past 20 years, buyers and suppliers formed partnerships to leverage supply chain efficiencies. Using technologies like EDI and ERP systems, companies began to share information, such as inventory, production, and forecasts, with key suppliers. Today, a large company might have such relationships with several dozen, or even hundreds or thousands, of suppliers.
Technologies and partnership like these bring significant improvements in efficiency to the supply chain. Wal-Mart, for example, has been a leader in redefining the retail supply chain for the better part of the last decade. Through direct contact with consumers and innovative technology strategies, Wal-Mart has been able to amass the largest database of customer information in the world. Driven by the goal of serving its customers better and supporting its everyday low-price concept, sharing information with suppliers is at the core of Wal-Mart’s supply chain strategy. In fact, Wal-Mart’s proprietary network, Retail Link, is several steps ahead of other supply chain management efforts in integrating the company’s EDI networks with an extranet used by its buyers and more than 10,000 suppliers. Indeed, the system links about 90% of Wal-Mart’s global suppliers in sourcing and other collaborative business processes. This information technology–driven strategy enables Wal-Mart to gather and disseminate information about sales and inventory levels, at the lowest level of detail, online and in real time.
Tier 3: Strategic partnerships
In general today, “flexible” supply chains, much less true demand networks, are hardly the norm. With increasing consumer demand for products that meet their needs as closely as possible, manufacturers are turning to true strategic partnerships to help build flexibility into their supply chains. Strategic partnerships are the top tier of relationships. Companies that have adopted the idea that collaboration sometimes even with competitors can make the supply chain more efficient and drive costs down are developing strategic partnerships with other companies. Yet the partnership also demonstrates how even the largest companies are rethinking their supply chains and shifting their focus to collaboration to remain competitive. Similarly, Dell Computer has created deep relationships with its 25 most important component suppliers and has used these relationships to establish itself as a nimble, low-cost leader in the personal computer industry. Dell has set up a private Internet site for these suppliers, which gives them real-time updates of Dell’s inventories as well as incoming customer orders. Dell also sends a purchasing forecast to its top suppliers each week, indicating how many hard drives, processors, and monitors it plans to purchase in the coming weeks. This information allows suppliers to ramp up production in anticipation of coming demand. These suppliers in turn provide Dell with regular updates of their anticipated costs and prices for the components. Dell can then forecast its costs for producing computers in the future, enabling it to set prices accordingly and to maintain its margins. In the future, Dell aims to deepen these relationships with suppliers even further by moving beyond collaborative forecasting to collaborative design, using the Internet to enable Dell engineers to design components in conjunction with engineers working for its most trusted suppliers. The success of these high-level relationships depends on trust and a seamless flow of information. As information systems among suppliers become more integrated, building and reinforcing trust between partners is crucial. For instance, we have already described how Wal-Mart has developed basic partnerships with its suppliers, but recently it has taken Retail Link a step further. In the last year, Wal-Mart has created a special private link into its system for only its most strategic partners and most critical transactions, thereby providing a secure forum for the exchange of high-value information among this elite group. In this way, relationships between business entities differ only marginally from business– consumer relationships. Building one-to-one relationships through the exchange of information remains the most important opportunity for strengthening and deepening both business and customer relationships.
One-to-one relationships in the demand network
One vital component of the emerging consumer-centric marketplace is the ability for companies, through the use of new technologies, to establish one-to-one learning relationships with consumers. These one-to-one customer relationships are the result of a company’s ability to track each contact with a customer, learn from that customer’s feedback, and tailor product, service, or communication based on that feedback. A company’s ability to respond to individual customer needs depends on its ability to mobilize its network of suppliers and partners in response to this information about what the customer wants. And so it goes for every player participating in the evolving demand network, each of whom has a customer to serve: retailers serve consumers, manufacturers serve retailers, contract manufacturers serve product manufacturers, component suppliers serve manufacturers, raw materials suppliers serve component suppliers, and the warehousing and transportation players serve virtually everyone. As the function and quality of these relationships continue to grow in importance, managing them effectively and deepening them to maximize their value will be an important element of success. While the basic strategies of identifying, differentiating, interacting, and customizing apply, there are special strategies for managing customer relations in a B2B environment. In One-to-One B2B, PRG outlines the seven critical areas where B2B strategies differ from B2C strategies. Three of them are especially salient in this discussion of the growing network of relationships among corporate firms: developing relationships within relationships, selling by developing accounts rather than simply adding customers, and focusing on just a few large customers.
Relationships within relationships
The most obvious difference between selling to an individual and selling to a business is that the consumer is a single decision-making unit, while the business has many decision makers. Because many people will have purchasing discretion in a business, the B2B organization must not only develop and grow its relationship with the business customer as an overall organization, it must also develop relationships with divisions, departments, groups, and individuals within the organization. Thus, supplier companies are implementing tools to empower individuals within the organization to interact directly with them. For example, Web-based applications for procurement, such as those used by Office Depot and FedEx, enable business customers to empower purchasing decisions to be made directly by the individual or group that needs the product or service. Account Development Selling Because of the complex nature of business customers, a B2B company that focuses on developing a relationship with its best customers is likely to be more successful. There are advantages in developing deeper account relationships with fewer customers as opposed to focusing on increasing the number of new customers acquired. When they are in the buyer’s seat, companies are looking for suppliers that can help them achieve their goals. Suppliers that are focused on account development rather than market penetration will employ customer-centric and loyalty-dependent strategies and will be able to help their customers achieve their goals and be successful themselves at the same time. For example, airline companies have devoted significant resources to providing a higher level of service to business travelers from the creation of in-flight business-class services offering more comfortable seating and better amenities to reward programs that provide significant loyalty incentives to the frequent business traveler. This focus on deepening these relationships with high-value business customers has in turn prompted the air-services demand network to respond in kind. For example, in an effort to provide business travelers optionsfor remaining connected traveling, Boeing is equipping its 747s with high-speed data networks, while Global, a satellite-based global-roaming Internet service provider, will allow in-flight passengers to access their e-mail accounts and surf the Web at higher speeds. These options enable commercial long distance air carriers, to provide an even higher level of service to their most valuable customers.
Just a few large customers
While a B2C company is likely to have thousands or millions of customers and can rely on generalized statistics about groups of customers to make decisions and then act to serve them, a B2B company usually has a much smaller customer pool and should not act on generalized conclusions about its customers. By developing at least basic partnerships with most customers and strategic partnerships with their best customers, suppliers can tailor their actions for each customer.
A company will be measured by the strength of its relationships
I n the evolving demand network, the need to serve the customer in concert with multiple partners and suppliers necessitates a foundation of strong relationships. In this new world, a company’s value will be tied closely to the extent and quality of its external relationships. To be successful, companies should keep the following insights in mind:
• Create flexibility through a network of relationships. Over the past 30 years, companies have outsourced an increasing percentage of corporate functions to outside suppliers of goods and services. In turn, they have realized the benefits of increased flexibility and cost efficiency. In the future, a company’s ability to be agile in a constantly changing marketplace will depend on the quality and diversity of its relationship network.
• Maintain a spectrum of relationships. In order to meet varied and complex needs, companies must increasingly rely on external relationships to respond to dynamic customer demands effectively. However, there is not one type of relationship that will enable companies to meet all these needs. Companies must develop competencies in maintaining a spectrum of relationships, from those that require the least investment to those that require significant commitments from partner companies.
• Develop metrics to measure relationship value. In the demand network, new metrics for measuring business success will emerge to evaluate a company not only on its revenues and profitability but also on its flexibility, external networks, and execution speed. In order to gauge performance, a company must be able to measure its effectiveness in building its external network, as well as the value of key B2B relationships.
