GMOA to FCID over government spending on SAITM

 
The Government Medical Officers' Association (GMOA) will make an official complaint to the <U+200B>Financial Crimes Investigation Division (<U+200B>FCID<U+200B>)<U+200B> in connection with <U+200B>the government <U+200B>pumping Rs. 900 million to Dr. Neville Fernando private hospital<U+200B>, in addition to the Rs. 3,500<U+200B> million being pumping to the same hospital annually, GMOA Media Spokesman Dr. Samantha Ananda said.
Addressing a press conference held at the GMOA Headquarters in Colombo today he said that the GMOA will also make a complain <U+200B>to the Right To Information Commission <U+200B>in connection with not providing the information requested from the University Grant<U+200B>s Commission (UGC) on SAITM. <U+200B>
<U+200B>According to Dr. Ananda, Health Ministry officially accepted the fact that it does not have any information, facts or details about Dr. Neville Fernando Hospital and the Higher Education Ministry officially accepted the fact that it does not have any information on SAITM obtaining the Compliance Certificate. Relevant officials of the two Ministries accepted those facts in writing, he said.
“It is surprising that how three politicians fool the country's Executive President and the parliament and do what they want putting the lives of innocent poor patients in danger. People wonder where the Executive powers of the President and the two third majority in the Parliament because none of them use for the welfare of the people who face a grave danger in future because of the SAITM issue and the various hardships faced by the entire country is due to not solving SAITM issue. Nobody wants SAITM except three politicians,” he added.<U+200B>
