So, you want to start-up and develop a small business – Part 05:
To create a successful business, find one that fulfils market need

Starting, owning, and running a successful small business is one of the great joys in life. There are no guarantees. But, if your business is - one suited to your strengths, one that you are passionate about, one which fulfils a specific market need, and (of course) one that allows you to make a nice profit - then there is no telling how far it can take you.
In the past four instalments, we tested your strengths and talents, your aptitudesand abilities and prepared you to face reality. Now, we are ready to begin the challenging entrepreneurial journey. Come aboard!
In this series, you will find tips, examples, and strategies that have been proven to help small businesses grow and that can help your small business also grow.
Love with the idea
When it comes to choosing a small business, there are two types of entrepreneurs.
The first is the person who is in love with the idea of starting a very specific business. This person may be a gardener who envisions opening a nursery or a chef who has long dreamed of owning a restaurant. The other potential small business person is someone who is also in love, not with a specific business but with the idea of being his or her own boss. As there are risks and rewards associated with each path, both warrant further discussion.
In life, we tend to succeed and perform well when we are engaged in something that we really enjoy. Your business should be no different.By now, you know what excites you, what it is that you love most. You know what you like to do, what your passions are, what is fun for you, and how you like to spend your time.
That is your first assignment: deciding which of your passions you love enough to start a business around. Remember, your business will become your baby, and like any baby, it will require a lot of love, time, money, and attention if it is to grow strong and healthy. Of those resources, right now, you should be most concerned with time. Your new business will take a lot of time, so pick something that you love doing because you will be spending a lot of time doing it.
What are your choices? You could, for instance: Start a nursery. Open a flower shop. Start a garden care business. Grow organic vegetables. Buy a small farm. Start a bakery.
This is the time for one of those “anything goes” brainstorming sessions. Go for it. Write down any kooky idea that you have. No limits! There are few times in life when the stars align themselves just so and we have a chance, not only for a fresh start, but for a fresh start that is completely of our own choosing. Usually, money is tight, the opportunity passes, or something else conspires to interfere with a brand-new beginning.
Assuming, then, that you have decided to pick a business that is a passionate practicality, the last question to be answered is whether you will be able to make sufficient profit from it. There is no sense in starting a business, however much you might love the idea, if you will not be able to make a good living. One reason we go into business for ourselves is the chance to make more money.
Finding a good idea is just the beginning - in fact, it is the easy part. The trick is being able to successfully implement that idea. That is much more difficult. As Thomas Edison said, genius is “1 percent inspiration and 99 percent perspiration.” That is as true in business as it is in science. Not only must you come up with a good idea, it must be a good idea that you can move on. That is what you are looking for.
Maybe your idea is so cutting-edge that no one else has thought of it. Innovative businesses have the chance to become market leaders. Being first gives you something called the first mover’s advantage. Simply put, by being first, you have the chance to shape the marketplace. The potential profit from such a business is enormous. The problem, as you may have surmised, is that it usually takes a lot of money to successfully create such a business. If you do not have the drive to do so, or the risk tolerance, or the capital, then you would be best advised to follow and not to lead.
In love with entrepreneurship
Now we come to the second sort of entrepreneur - the individual who is more concerned with being his or her own boss than with starting a particular business. Jeff Bezos did not start Amazon.com because he was in love with books. He started it because he discovered that Internet use in the early 1990s was growing at a whopping 2,300 percent per year.
Armed with that valuable insight, he analysed the marketplace and the opportunity and concluded that the best way to tap the commercial power of the Internet was through book sales. Because it was not about the books but rather the opportunity, Bezos is the prototypical second category of entrepreneur.
There is no shortage of people who start their own business because, simply put, they want to be their own boss; that is as great a reason as any. The ability to make your own decisions, the chance to rise or fall by your own ingenuity and hard work, the opportunity to make more money, and the freedom that comes with being a small business person are some of the great joys in life. It is no wonder that many people long to start their own business. When done right, it is successful.
The question is, what is the best sort of business for you to start? If you want to create a great business, a successful business, then here is a critical tip: find a business that fulfils a market need. Thatstatement should become your mantra. The best businesses find an unfulfilled need - a niche - and fill it. Do that, and almost everything else will fall into place.
If you are looking for a business to start, the number one thing to discover is whether that business can sell something that people need. Figure what pain or need the customer has that you can solve.
Six steps
Here are six steps to take to come to the correct decision and find that great business idea.
1. Research and research
After research then do some more research. Your first step is to analyse both the marketplace and the opportunities that are available. Look around, find some businesses that are doing something that looks good to you, and learn about those businesses. How hard are they to create? How much money do they make? How much money would you need to start the business? The options are many, and there is no shortage of associations and websites that are ready to help you find the right business to start.
2. Product or service
When it comes down to it, your business will provide people with a product or a service. Service businesses tend to be less expensive to start, as there is no inventory to buy or products to stock. Whereas product businesses mark up prices on scores of products and profit from the difference, service businesses, such aslawyers, doctors, consultants, gardeners sell time and expertise. An initial decision, then, is which of these businesses best suits your temperament, skills, and goals.
3. Analyze your skills and experience
Suppose you have spent your career doing marketing for major comapny. That is an invaluable skill, and it should be tapped when deciding what business is right for you. Even if it is not a marketing business, you would be foolhardy not to choose a business that does not somehow tap into your well of knowledge and skill. Now, it may be that you are tired of doing whatever it is you have been doing, and that, in fact, is why you want to start your own business. Understandable, for sure. Just be open to the option of finding a business that gives you a leg up on the competition because of your background.
4. Consider your options.
You could create a business from scratch. You could buy an existing business. You could start a franchise. You could create a home-based business. The possibilities are many. It is important to realize that there are, in fact, a variety of options when choosing a business and learning about the pros and cons of each. We will be talking about them in later instalments. But research the industry, and speak with people in those sorts of businesses.
5. Narrow your choices
Once you have analysed the market, the opportunities available, your skills and experience, and your goals, you should be able to narrow your choice down to a few types of businesses. The next step may be the most important one. You must go out and find people who own and run these sorts of businesses. Theories and books are great, but nothing beats speaking with someone who lives that business every day.
6. Start your engines
Whether you want to start a business because you want to start a business or because you want to spend your time pursuing your passion, it is important to do your homework and to find a niche that fills a market need. Do that, and you are on your way.
