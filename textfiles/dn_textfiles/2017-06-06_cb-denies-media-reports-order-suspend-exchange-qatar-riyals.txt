CB denies media reports on order to suspend exchange of Qatar Riyals

 
The Central Bank of Sri Lanka said in their official site today that media reports saying that they issued an order to suspend the exchange of Qatar Riyals from all banks are false.
However BIA banks began to exchange Qatar Riyals following the brief suspension, a short while ago.
The suspension caused discomfort to passengers.
