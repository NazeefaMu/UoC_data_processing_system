Merging fashion and art

The HSBC Colombo Fashion Week’s 14th year saw a new initiative - a project where fashion meets art. Under the theme 'Celebrate Colombo' which is done in association with the Sri Lanka Tourism, this project is called ‘Art Connect’. This event exemplifies the connection between the creative streams of fashion and art.
Art Connect was the first of the series of events during the week of CFWand it was the Colombo Fashion Week kick-off event.
