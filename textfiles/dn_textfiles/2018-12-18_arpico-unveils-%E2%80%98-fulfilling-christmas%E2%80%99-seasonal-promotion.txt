Arpico unveils ‘A Fulfilling Christmas’ with seasonal promotion

Dressed in blue, red and gold, colours associated with royalty the Arpico retail chain has launched an unparalleled Christmas shopping experience this festive season, coupled with the exciting prospect of one lucky family winning an all-expenses-paid trip to Paris.
All Arpico supermarkets in the country have been transformed for what the retail giant calls ‘a fulfilling Christmas’ with the bright lights and decorations associated with the season, discounts, special offers and the chain’s customary year-end promotion.
The flagship Supercentre at Hyde Park, will as usual be the festive hotspot of them all, with decorations commencing at the main entrance and encompassing the entire store and the sprawling car park, a highlight of which is a canopy of LED lights illuminating the entire area.
In the spirit of the season of giving, families that shop at Arpico for Rs 10,000 or more between November 20 and January 15, with at least eight nominated brands in the mix of purchases, will be eligible to enter a draw and win a trip to Paris, one of Europe’s most enchanting capitals.
Alternatively, such customers may win a reward of a gift voucher equivalent to 15 per cent of the value of their purchases instantly at the cashier’s counter.
For shoppers who participate in the draw to win a holiday in Paris, the draw is to be conducted in the last week of January 2019 and the trip is planned for February, targeting Valentine’s Day.
Christmas at Arpico goes beyond décor changes and prizes, however: this season, the Company has announced special offers on more than 900 products with discounts of up to 25 per cent on daily essentials, electronics and household items, and an extra special 35 per cent discount for ‘Privilege’ Loyalty Card holders on popular seasonal items.
Additionally, attractive discounts are available on most of the popular credit cards including those of HSBC, American Express, Commercial Bank, HNB, and Standard Chartered Bank for purchases of fresh produce, hampers, daily essentials and household items. Credit card holders are also eligible to instalment plans on purchases of electronics, furniture and festive hampers.
Indulging the seasonal requirements of shoppers, a series of Christmas Specials including hampers in impressive presentation boxes and rustic wicker chests, seasonal cheeses and meats, Christmas cakes, goodies and cake ingredients, festive décor items, seasonal gifts and imported household items and a wide array of toys have supplemented the regular offering at Arpico supermarkets around the country.
