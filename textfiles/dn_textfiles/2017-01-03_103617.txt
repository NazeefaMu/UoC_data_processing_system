JO to agitate against move to sell Hambantota port

 
The Joint Opposition (JO) yesterday said they would continue to agitate against a move by the government to sell a majority of shares in the Hambantota port to a Chinese company.
MP Vasudeva Nanayakkara told journalists in Colombo that the JO will launch protests as well as take legal action in this regard. He said the pending legal case in courts filed by the JO against the move by the government will bear fruit.
Nanayakkara said the government was planning to sell several other key state assets.
Nanayakkara said that if the port is incurring losses, the government’s mismanagement causes it. He said the Hambantota port had a vast potential, and it was government’s responsibility to harness that instead of selling it to foreign countries.
Ports and Shipping Minister Arjuna Ranatunga in recent times refuted JO accusations saying that under the new arrangement, the port will operate as a joint Public-Private Partnership venture of Sri Lanka and Chinese investors.
