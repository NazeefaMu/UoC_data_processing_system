PSA Airlines selects IFS MAINTENIX for its maintenance solutions

IFS, the global enterprise applications company, announced that PSA Airlines (PSA), a wholly owned subsidiary of American Airlines and one of the fastest growing regional operators in North America, has selected IFS Maintenix to support its enterprise-wide fleet maintenance management needs.
This latest deal comes on the heels of other recent contracts with leading airlines such as Copa Airlines, Cape Air and Southwest Airlines, and reflects the IFS Maintenix software’s expanding footprint among operators of all sizes across the Americas.
It is the first order to be announced since the IFS acquisition of Mxi closed in January 2017.
As a flourishing carrier owned by the largest airline in the world, PSA recently embarked on a strategic growth plan that has seen its fleet more than double from 49 aircraft to 115 since 2014, with plans to operate up to 150 Bombardier CRJ aircraft.
To meet evolving operational demands, the airline was looking to replace its legacy maintenance system with a modern, scalable software solution that could significantly reduce reliance on manual processes and drive greater standardization and process efficiencies across its maintenance management chain.
Following an extensive market review, PSA selected IFS Maintenix as its maintenance IT system to deliver complete lifecycle MRO functionality across the engineering, planning, line maintenance and materials management departments. By enabling more real-time, automated maintenance management, PSA Airlines is taking the necessary steps to meeting strategic objectives while staying focused on their mission of safety, quality and compliance.
“In this competitive market, PSA Airlines prides itself on providing customers with the highest degree of customer service and operational performance that comes from well-maintained aircraft, professional and dedicated staff, and on-time passenger services delivery,” said Gary Pratt, Vice President, Maintenance and Engineering at PSA Airlines.
