Trump’s India partner sees ‘overwhelming’ interest  in apartments

Apartments carrying the Trump brand are selling like hotcakes on the outskirts of India’s capital.
Buyers snapped up 20 apartments worth a combined 1.5 billion rupees ($24 million) at the Trump Towers in Gurgaon, about 19 miles outside New Delhi, within a day of them going on sale last week, the developers said.
“Interest has been overwhelming,” Kalpesh Mehta, chairman of the Trump Organization’s main India partner, Tribeca Developers, told CNNMoney. The company will release updated figures “when we reach another sales milestone in the coming weeks,” he added.
Dozens more luxury homes in the Gurgaon complex are up for grabs -- its two towers will have a total of 250 apartments, with price tags ranging from around $800,000 to $1.6 million. Construction on the complex will likely begin next month and is expected to be completed by 2023. CNN News
