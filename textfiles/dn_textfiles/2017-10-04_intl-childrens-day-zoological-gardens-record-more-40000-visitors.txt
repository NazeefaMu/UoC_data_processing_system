Int'l Children's Day: Zoological Gardens record more than 40,000 visitors

The Dehiwala Zoological Gardens recorded more than 40,000 visitors on October 1, when International Children's Day ceremonies were held at the Zoological Gardens under the patronage of Sustainable Development and Wild Life Deputy Minister Sumedha Jayasena. Among them were 33,000 school children and 17,000 elders.
A Ministry release said the gates of the Zoological Gardens were open for children this day, while several competitions, games and other programmes were held by Zoological Gardens authorities to provide a rollicking time for the children
The programme also included several dance items presented by schools, elephant dances and other events. Winners of the competitions received prizes and awards from the Deputy Minister.
Speaking on the occasion, Deputy Minister Sumedha G. Jayasena said every day of the year, rather than a single day should be dedicated to children who are the inheritors of the country's future.
