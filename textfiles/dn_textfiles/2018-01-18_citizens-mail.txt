COAL POWER PLANTS - A CORRECT DECISION
It is gratifying to read that Minister Sarath Amunugama has taken charge of the policy decision regarding the use of coal for electric power generation. There seems to be feverish activity by the anti-coal lobby led by Eng Parakrama Jayasinghe, Dr Ranil Senanayake and Dr Janaka Ratnasiri to scuttle this wise move.
What I would like to point out is that at last Sri Lanka is aligning itself to what nearly every country in the region is doing. Which is going for the coal option to ensure dependable electricity production? Our neighbour India already has over 500 coal fueled plants and plans to add 486 more.
India which is also a signatory of the Paris Climate Change Protocol is reneging on compliance and adding coal power plants, not LNG. The Chairman of Indian Electricity Board Verna, said my first priority is to supply electric power to the people, justifying his decision to go ahead with 486 new coal plants in addition to existing 559.
His claims that the CEB has gone out against the Coal Option is also false as clearly stated by G A D Srimal.
Our neighbour Tamil Nadu generates nearly 10,000 MW of Coal-fired Electric Power. I could not find a single new LNG Plant.
And now Dr Janaka Ratnasiri writes that we are in the Bullock cartage if we resort to coal power as opposed to LNG.
