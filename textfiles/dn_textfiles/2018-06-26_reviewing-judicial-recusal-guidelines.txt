Reviewing Judicial Recusal Guidelines

When a judge recuses himself (or herself) from hearing a nationally important case and the hearing is postponed, it becomes a disturbing news for any layman. If recusal happens four times in the same case resulting long postponements, then it’s natural for the layman to become worried. The obvious question he might ask, is; What happens to the Common Law and doctrine of the “Duty to Sit”?
At this point the two doctrines – Recusal and Duty to sit - need to be clarified.
Recusal (of a judge) means excusing oneself from a case because of a potential conflict of interest or lack of impartiality. It is an ancient civil law concept fundamental to democracy and due process. Prior to the 19th Century, judges were allowed to preside in situations that today would almost universally be considered improper. Disqualification of judges for bias was rare, and except for those cases that contravened the core principle that “no man should be a judge in his own case,” only a direct financial stake in a case usually disqualified a judge. This view persisted into the 20th Century.
The second point is ‘Duty to Sit’ doctrine. This doctrine emphasizes a judge’s obligation to hear and decide cases, without fear or favour, affection or ill will, unless there are compelling grounds for disqualification. Professor Upendra Baxi, scholar and professor of law at the University of Warwick, UK, addressing a seminar in 2016 said that we need to question why there is recusal, and whether reason for such recusal is needed or not. He added that there is a Doctrine of Recusal as well as Doctrine of ‘Duty to sit’ and since these two doctrines are conflicting to each other, a balance must be sought between the two in the interest of true justice.
Gotabhaya issue
The subject matter of recusal has surfaced in the recent past mainly due to a specific case filed by the former Defence Secretary, Gotabhaya Rajapaksa. He filed a FR petition in 2015 seeking a stay order preventing his arrest by the Financial Crimes Investigation Division (FCID), which was probing the controversial MiG deal, the Avant Garde issue and the share purchase of Apollo Hospital. The case was first taken up on May 13, 2015. Since then, four justices of the Supreme Court have recused themselves from hearing the case.
The situation has become more intriguing on account of the fact that no reasons were given by the judges for their recusals. The fact that judges, at different times, have recused themselves from this particular case have led to speculation specially since the public is not aware of the reasons for such withdrawals. One might even wonder, whether our respected and learned justices are abdicating their constitutional duties and responsibilities.
Solutions
Fortunately, the voluntary recusals by judges in Sri Lankan jurisdictions have been few and far between. However, some believe, that due to rapidly changing political and social scenarios in our country, it may become most routine in time to come.
Notwithstanding criticism that the ‘duty to sit’ doctrine is an out-dated doctrine, which some believe needed to be buried in today’s context, judges of the American Supreme Court have continuously drawn sustenance from the ‘duty to sit’ doctrine on the assumption that the doctrine was activated by public policy reasons.
Keeping aligned with the international thinking, what can we, in Sri Lanka, do to effect changes in recusal procedure? A legal expert involved in the constitutional reforms process speaking to the Sunday Observer recently, explained how critical it was for the current system to be reviewed with provisions made available for similar circumstances. Appointing ad-hoc judges from the Court of Appeal was one option, the expert said. “If the trend continues, the Chief Justice would then have to discuss the matter with other judges and decide how to proceed”.
New Zealand experience
Perhaps, we could learn a lesson or two from New Zealand experience. In March 2017, New Zealand introduced Recusal guidelines for their Supreme Court.
The guidelines were published in accordance with s 171(2) of the Senior Courts Act 2016. The following are some extracts from the guidelines of New Zealand:
1. The guiding principle is that a judge is disqualified from sitting if in the circumstances there is a real possibility that in the eyes of a fair-minded and fully informed observer the judge might not be impartial in reaching a decision in the case. An instance is where a judge has a material interest in the outcome of the appeal.
2. The test is a two-step one requiring consideration of: (a) what are the circumstances relevant to the possible need for recusal because of apparent bias? (b) whether those circumstances lead to a reasonable apprehension the judge may not be impartial.
3. The test requires ascertainment of, first, what it is that might possibly lead to a reasonable apprehension that the judge might decide the case other than on its merits and, secondly, whether there is a logical and sufficient connection between those circumstances and that apprehension.
4. Once leave to appeal to the Supreme Court has been sought, each judge has a duty to acquaint all colleagues in the Court with any known circumstances which may give rise to a concern among the litigants, or the public, that the judge might not be impartial in the case. Every judge is similarly under a duty to bring to the attention of all other colleagues any circumstances which may lead to such a concern in respect of any other judge.
5. If, after discussion of the circumstances with all other judges, the judge concerned is satisfied there is a real possibility that he or she cannot act impartially or is satisfied that a fair-minded and fully informed observer might reach that view, the judge will decide not to sit on the appeal.
6. In any other case, after such discussions, the judge will issue a minute addressed to the parties to the litigation drawing their attention to the relevant circumstances and inviting them to indicate if they have any views on whether the judge should sit on the appeal. The minute will indicate that in addition to indicating their views and drawing the judge’s attention to any additional matters thought relevant, if a party objects to the judge sitting on the grounds raised or any other grounds, counsel should say so. The minute should set a time for response by the parties.
7. If an objection is received, that will be determined by all the judges available, other than the judge who is the subject of the objection. Those judges may call for submissions and hear the parties as they think appropriate.
8. If no objection to the judge sitting is received, all judges will consider any material provided in response to the judge’s minute but the judge concerned will decide whether or not to sit.
9. Where a party (of its own motion) considers there to be a possible conflict of interest, a memorandum must be filed at the earliest possible opportunity setting out the particular circumstances giving rise to the alleged conflict. The Court will (usually) ask for a response from the other parties. Subject top paragraph 10, the objection will be dealt with in terms of paragraphs 5 and 7of these guidelines.
10. Recusal applications made at a hearing or close in time to the allocated hearing date of an application or an appeal are generally not appropriate. If an issue of conflict of interest is raised at this late stage, the Court hearing the application or the appeal will usually deal with the matter.
The other guidelines clarify about disclosure of conflict of interest: principles and practice.
New Zealand has separate guidelines for High Courts and District Courts.
Introducing guidelines for Courts is a highly sensitive issue. Hence, there needs to be a lot of discussions among stakeholders need to be done before a decision is taken. It could be done either through judicial initiative or by legislative intervention, whichever is agreeable for all. Clear and forthright standards would enhance the court’s credibility and the public trust.
