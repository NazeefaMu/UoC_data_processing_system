Sixteen SLFP MPs who left Govt., to create strong alliance against UNP: SB

Former Minister S.B. Dissanayake in a special statement said yesterday, that the 16 SLFP MPs who left the government, would contribute to create a strong alliance against the United National Party together with all parties in the Opposition.
Dissanayake also said that these 16 SLFP MPs would back the Opposition in any justifiable fight against the government, while working in support of any government endevour, which would be beneficial to the people.
Speaking of the cross over, Dissanayake said that they believed that it was appropriate to sit in the Opposition, since they had voted in favour of the no confidence motion against Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe.
“We worked in support of the no confidence motion. However, PM Wickremesinghe proved that he still got the confidence of the House.’ So it is only but proper and democratic for us to sit in the Opposition and allow him to continue with the government,” Dissanayake said.
He also said that their loss of confidence against the Prime Minister, is mainly due to the Central Bank Treasury Bond issue that severely affected the economy of the country.
Dissanayake also said that all Opposition party leaders, welcomed them and extended their fullest support. Dissanayake also thanked the Speaker of the House for immediate seating arrangement for the 16 SLFP MPs who crossed over.
Meanwhile in his speech, Dissanayake raised his concerns over a statement made by Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe at the May Day rally with regards to an absence of Rs 67.5 mn belonging to the Samurdhi Social Protection Fund.
Dissanayake while pointing out that it was a serious allegation, urged that an investigation be expedited on the matter. “This allegation affects both the Samurdhi Social Protection Fund as well as the Ministry of Social Empowerment and Welfare. Even if 675 cents belonging to the Samurdhi fund had disappeared, it is a serious issue. So I urged for an immediate investigation on the matter. I am not trying to put the blame on anybody else. I am ready to take responsibility as the Minister who held the portfolio at that time,” Dissanayake said.
