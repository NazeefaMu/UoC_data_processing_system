No confidence motion against Wayamba Governor

A no confidence motion against Wayamba Governor Amara Piyaseeli Ratnayake drawn up by a majority of governing party members of the Wayamba Provincial Council was handed over to Council Chairman Tikiri Banda Adhikari on February 21.
The motion alleged that the Governor had deliberately contravened provisions of the constitution by approving the procedure to be adopted by the Line Ministry to appoint a Provincial Education Director and naming members for a board of interview for that purpose, said UPFA member Sumith Rajapaksa who handed over the motion to the Council Chairman at his chamber at the conclusion of a crucial meeting held on February 21.
The governing party of the Council has 34 members and the opposition has 17 members in the Council which has a total of 51 members.
The motion, if it is to be adopted, should gain the approval of two thirds of the total membership in the Council, which means 34 members.
The motion maybe included in the crucial agenda on March 7.
