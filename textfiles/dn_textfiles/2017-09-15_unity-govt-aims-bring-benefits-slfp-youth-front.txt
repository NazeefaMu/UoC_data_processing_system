Unity govt aims to bring benefits: SLFP Youth Front

Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) Youth Front Chairman Shantha Bandara said the SLFP formed the unity government aiming to bring benefits to the country and its people.
Bandara was addressing the media at the SLFP headquarters.
He said introducing a new constitution and implementing a new electoral system are among the factors that were considered when forming the unity government.
Bandara said the 66th anniversary of the SLFP which was held successfully, showcased that the SLFP is not limited to its name board.
“Certain members of the Joint Opposition said the SLFP is now limited to its name board but the 66th Convention of the party helped to null those allegations,” he added.
Bandara said the Youth Front stands for the youth quota of Local Government elections. As a result of a discussion the Youth Front had with the President recently, the Central Committee (CC) of the SLFP has been instructed by the President to offer 30 percent quota for youths at the Local Government Elections.
“We are opposing the decision to remove the youth quota when amending the local government election act,” he said.
While speaking on the present political environment of the SLFP, Bandara said the party is strengthening gradually. People are rallying round the party every day, he added.
He said party-friendly members, who are at present with the Joint Opposition, would never get the membership of other parties.
Bandara speaking on the sil cloth issue said the lawsuit has shown that no one is above the law, he noted.
However, he added that it is unethical to comment on a Court’s decision. It cannot be accepted that certain persons are commenting on the Court’s decision in accordance with their political views.
