A CEO’s Guide to GDPR breakfast forum on July 11

A breakfast forum, A CEO’s Guide to GDPR” will be held on July 11 at Shangri-La Hotel, Colombo.
The E.U General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) is a significant shift in how personal information will be managed and protected. The exposure to the processing of data of E.U residents and non-compliance is of high financial significance. The challenge for leaders in organizations will be to balance the necessary controls while providing the enabling environment for your company to thrive.
A key feature of this breakfast seminar will be a discussion of GDPR in the context of Cyber security. While the seminar will aim to cover the key features of the regulation, it will also provide guidance in terms of compliance and tools required for implementation.
Shalini Ratwatte, Head of Legal and Corporate Affairs for South East Asia New Markets at Microsoft will deliver the key presentation. It will then be followed by a panel discussion with Anjali Fernando, Partner FJ & G de Saram and Hasitha Abeywardena, Country Manager for Sri Lanka and Maldives at Microsoft. Shiran Fernando, Chief Economist at the Ceylon Chamber of Commerce will moderate the discussion.
This event serves as animportant opportunity for corporate leaders to be able to provide leadership from the top in implementing the new regulations.
