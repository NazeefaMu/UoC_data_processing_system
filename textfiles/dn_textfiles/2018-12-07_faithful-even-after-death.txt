Faithful even after death

When animals enter our lives, they give real meaning to true friendship. Regardless of how we come across them, they make our days brighter. They evolve into family over time because they give relief from the burdens of everyday life. We rely heavily on their relentless loyalty to us and their ability to bring happiness to our life.
Sometimes we even find more comfort in our animals than we do with humans because they never seem to disappoint. People say that some animals have shorter life spans than humans because they are born knowing how to love, while humans must obtain that quality somewhere along the way of our longer lives.
But what happens when owners meet their end before their animals? While animals can’t mouth their devotion or grief with words, in regards to their late owners, these specific animals’ actions speak volumes to how far the bond between animal and human really goes.
