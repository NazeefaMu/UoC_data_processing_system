Donor conference on Sri Lanka soon

Special Assignment Minister Dr. Sarath Amunugama said the Government has planned to hold a donor conference with immediate effect aiming to fulfill financial needs and finding a permanent solution to the flood problem.
He was addressing the media at the SLFP headquarters yesterday.
The Minister said the idea of holding the donor conference was mooted by the President at the recent Cabinet meeting aiming to find a lasting solution to the damage and destruction caused by floods and landslides in a few districts from time to time, including the Ratnapura, Kalutara and Galle districts.
The venue of the donor conference has not been finalised as yet and it could be held here or abroad.
A three member committee has been appointed by the President in this regard. Accordingly, Finance Minister Mangala Sameraweera, Foreign Minister Ravi Karunanayake and Minister Dr. Sarath Amunugama were appointed to the committee.
The committee will submit proposals to the donor conference, where the proposals will be considered by the donor countries.
“The project proposals, which was prepared on a district or electoral base, provide permanent suggestions to control floods. The aid may be either financial or technological. Flood disasters cannot be mitigated only by giving flood relief as there should be a long lasting solution to it” he said. The Minister added that according to rough estimates, a sum of US $ 300 million will be needed for the proposed flood control project of Kalu Ganga.
“Under the proposed Kalu Gamga project, three dams are constructed at Malwala, Dela in the Ratnapura district. Besides, a few separate proposals will be introduced to control floods in other districts based on the Nilwala Ganga and Kalu Ganga,” he said.
Asked when the donor conference be held, the Minister said that it has been planned to be held immediately,most probably within two months.
