1st  Under 19 test
Paceman Wijesinghe (4/68) restricts Bangladesh to 309

Sri Lanka bowlers came back strongly to dismiss Bangladesh for 309 on the second day of the first under 19 cricket test played at the NCC grounds yesterday.
Bangladesh resuming in a strong position at 209-3 lost their remaining seven wickets for 100 runs with right-arm pacie Chamindu Wijesinghe doing the main damage with figures of 4 for 68.
Bangladesh overnight pair skipper Towhid Hridoy and Shamim Hossain both failed to add to their overnight scores being dismissed for 54 and 43 respectively.
The Sri Lankan under 19 bowlers evaded a worthwhile pursuit against Bangladesh as they piled up 309 first innings total, adding only 100 runs on the second day of the first Test played at the NCC ground yesterday.
But Amite Hasan coming at the fall of the fifth wicket steadied the innings with a fine half century scoring 64 off 99 balls (6 fours). However the rest of the batting fell apart and Bangladesh who had looked headed for a big first innings score folded up quickly.
Sri Lankan openers Navod Paranavithana and Kamil Mishra gave the side a good start with a 55-run partnership. Mishra was dismissed before the close for 17, leaving Paranavithana unbeaten on 35 to resume the innings on the third day today with his captain Nipun Dananjaya on five.
The match commenced yesterday at 1.00 pm due to bad weather.
