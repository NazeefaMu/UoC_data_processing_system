[APPRECIATIONS - (22-10-2018)]

Dr. Gamini Wijesekera
Outstanding doctor
A man accepted by all as a gentleman to the core—a rare man of sublime quality is not amongst us anymore. He left us tragically 24 years ago on October 24, 1994.
I became quite close to Dr. Gamini Wijesekera after getting married to his youngest sister in 1975. Henceforth, I had a close relationship with him till he left us on that fateful day.
He was an outstanding alumni of Trinity College, Kandy and Ananda College, Colombo. Even today, his alma maters acknowledge him as a student of rare capabilities. After his secondary education, he entered the Peradeniya University’s Medicine Faculty and passed out as an MBBS doctor. Subsequently, he qualified as a child specialist and joined the Government Service.
As the Government Medical Officers’ Association (GMOA) Secretary, he won the hearts of all, serving them not only as a fellow doctor, but also as a father figure who overcame all trials and tribulations.
After he left the Government Service, he did not rest on his laurels, but opened a private dispensary at Pannipitiya, serving one and all: the underprivileged, the middle-class, as well as the well-to-do. It came to such a pass that he had only to lay his hands on the sick and suffering and they were cured. His name and fame spread so far and wide that crowds flocked to his dispensary, which made it seem like a state outpatients’ clinic.
While practicing medicine, Dr. Wijesekera joined politics. He started his political career while being a University undergraduate.
In 1977, he was elected to the United National Party’s Executive Committee. He served as the Chairman of many Government Statutory Corporations and ultimately became the Transport and Highways Ministry’s Secretary. At the parliamentary by-election in 1983, he contested the Maharagama Constituency as a candidate of the United National Party, and his main opponent was Dinesh Gunawardane, the present party leader of the Mahajana Eksath Peramuna (MEP).
He functioned in many government organisations which included, inter alia, Lanka Milk Foods, the Moratuwa University, Foreign Employment Bureau, Ceylon Transport Board, as well as the University Grants Commission.
He was also a social worker and was the first Chairman of the Maharagama Rotary Club. He was also the Chairman of the Maharagama Cancer Society. Once, he simultaneously headed the Colombo District Cricket Association and held the post of Senior Vice Chairman of the Sri Lanka Cricket Board.
He was elected a provincial councillor at the Western Provincial Council Election in 1993 and in May, 1994, he assumed duties as the United National Party’s General Secretary. He also became a Member of Parliament in August, 1994 and just two months later, his life was taken away.
Dr. Wijesekera is the eldest son of late Professor O.H. de A. Wijesekera, a former Colombo University Vice Chancellor and Professor of Sanskrit. His mother Mabel Wijesekera is a graduate of the same university.
He left behind his beloved wife Daisy Wijesekera; daughter Dr. Bavani Charithya Wijesekera, who is an anesthetist at the Sri Jayawardenepura Hospital and son Dumesh Praveen Wijesekera. He also leaves behind all those who were so close to him, as well as those who loved the fair politics and true democracy he practiced.
You made our lives so happy,
You filled our days with joy
You cared for us and loved us,
With a charming smile and heart of gold
May you attain the Supreme Bliss of Nirvana!
Srilal

Prof. A.J. Fernando
Man of sophisticated wit
I was awakened by a call from my cousin Shehan de Tissera saying that one of the cleverest, outstanding, and certainly the highest achiever of my family, had died in Canada. It was my mother Lakshmi Sylvia’s younger brother: uncle Athula.
My uncle rose to the highest position in his profession, globally: Professor Athula Fernando (or Prof. A.J. Fernando as he was internationally known), former Dean of the School of Medical Rehabilitation at the University of Manitoba, was President of the World Confederation for Physical Therapy (WCPT) between 1991 and 1995.
The three messages for the centenary year of the Chartered Society of Physiotherapy, UK, published in the Physiotherapy Journal’s 80th volume in January, 1994, bore the names and signatures of the Prince of Wales, Baroness Robson and Prof. A.J. Fernando.
Uncle Athula’s message read: Congratulations on your centenary: The work of the Chartered Society of Physiotherapy is a record of achievement. On behalf of the World Confederation of Physical Therapy, please accept warm and sincere good wishes for continued success.
A.J. Fernando was the first President of the Confederation with third-world roots, being born and educated in Ceylon.
Prof. Fernando graduated from the Colombo University’s Medical College and obtained his doctorate from the Manchester University. My uncle was a scintillating public speaker who dressed stylishly and drove a Porsche into his 80’s.
Highly literate (Similar to his father T.R. Fernando), uncle Athula was a travelled and cultured man; a superb conversationalist with sophisticated wit. Uncle Athula and my father Mervyn de Silva had an easy and natural rapport.
As a hobby during retirement, he pressed grapes into wine. He was the son of T.R. and Annie Fernando of Moratuwa. He leaves behind his sister (my aunt) Chitra as the sole survivor of my mother’s family, as well as his wife Nadja and two sons by aunty Monica: my cousins Parakrama and Naresh.

Wickrema de Alwis
Dedicated planter
The curtain came down on the life of Wickrema de Alwis on October 20 at the age of 87, leaving friends and family to reflect on the qualities of a man that made him not just one of the finest tea planters the industry had known, but also a true gentleman in every sense of the word.
My association with Wick, as he was fondly known, goes back to the mid-70’s when as a young executive at George Steuart’s (then renowned for managing plantations), I was assigned the task of handling the desk of its Standard Tea Company which comprised six remarkable estates in Udapussellawa, as well as others in Bogawantalawa and Lindula.
Wick was the superintendent of one of them: the Kotiyagala Group in Bogawantalawa, a highly profitable property with a popular selling mark, which he took great pride in. His leadership was by example, combining the highest level of integrity with a ‘no nonsense’ approach to work and ethics that were impossible to surpass and yet worthy to emulate.
Unsurprisingly, every young planter who served under him went on to reach great heights in their own careers thanks to a foundation of integrity, commitment and accountability instilled by their strict disciplinarian; Peria Dorai Boss.
Here lies yet another story of what exemplary leadership can do for a succeeding generation no matter what the field.
Following the nationalisation of plantations in 1975/76, Wick was appointed to chair a regional board, where his expertise and high standards benefitted a cluster of estates and the numerous personnel who worked there.
He became a much sought-after visiting agent and it is common knowledge that the bushes flushed green and tea prices soared on every mark he visited.
His official residences had beautifully manicured lawns surrounded by exotic roses, while his impeccably maintained homes were a joy to visit.
There walls were studded with photos of the many pedigreed handsome canines that surrounded his life; relationships of love and care may well have inspired the likes of Barbara Cartland to even greater heights!
In retirement, he lived initially in rented accommodation in Watapuluwa, off Kandy and I have fond memories of our weekends together, enjoying long walks while reminiscing the positive and negative sides of life and humanity.
He followed our nation’s cricket with a passion and was quick to put pen to paper whenever he felt that something in that field needed correction. The media respected his wisdom and often published his views.
He was blessed in his domestic Saveria, a faithful ‘Man Friday’ of almost 40 years whose loyalty and respect for his master remained unwavering throughout that period—a rare occurrence indeed and yet a reflection of a large and caring heart that Wick hid under a strict and exacting exterior.
Kalimuttu, his driver of shorter duration was equally devoted, but less disciplined as his refusal to give up smoking much to Wick’s anger and dismay eventually took toll of his lungs and life.
Needless to say that Wick reciprocated this loyalty by ensuring that Kalimuttu’s children were put on career paths that opened doors to greater opportunities.
Sadly, the collapse of the Golden Key Finance Company where he had a major part of his life savings, cruelly devastated him and took an inevitable toll on his health.
He was compelled to move to a retirement home in Bolgoda, where he spent his final years in decline.
His meticulous planning for a contented retired life that he so richly deserved was shattered by the irresponsibility of an institution he trusted.
Though miles away, Wick, you are very much in my thoughts. May you find the peaceful rest you deserve.

Samantha Gallage
A brave comrade who saved many a life
Twenty-five years ago on January 18, 1993, at Fort Hammenhiel, Karinagar, two officers and 42 sailors, all volunteers from the navy, underwent a special training to start a new unit known as the Special Boat Squadron (SBS) or the Naval Commando Unit.
The SBS was formed to fight against Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) troops in lagoons and waterways. Our training also focused on carrying out attacks behind enemy lines to destroy LTTE sea-tiger installations. The UK Royal Marines Special Boat Squadron was our model.
I was fortunate to command this unit and train my men to be the “Bravest of the Brave” in the navy. I was a young Lieutenant Commander at the time and my Second-in-Command was an officer who was more than 12 years younger to me. He was Acting Sub-lieutenant Samantha Waruna Gallage from Dehiwala.
As a student of Dehiwala MMV and a member of Kinross Swimming Club, Samantha was trained as life guard and was also a volunteer life guard at the Mount Lavinia beach during weekends. He had saved a number of lives during that time. He was an outstanding swimmer who performed excellently in his naval training. Samantha was also an excellent boat handler as well as a top marksman.
We trained together for eight months in the Karainagar lagoon with the intention of taking over boat operations in the Jaffna lagoon from our small detachment at Nagadevannturai.
On 11th November 1993, LTTE launched ‘Operation Frog’. Our naval detachment in Nagadevanthuri and Pooneryn Army Complex came under heavy attack from the enemy. One by one, small detachments around the main Pooneryn Army Complex fell into the enemy’s hand and more than 700 military personnel were trapped in Pooneryn.
As there was no possibility to reinforce the besieged army complex from the air, military commanders decided to send reinforcements through an amphibious landing. My unit, the brand-new Naval Special Force (the SBS), was tasked to carry out the first wave.
Landing at an enemy beach is a suicidal task. It is bloody and chaotic. There is no cover for you until you cross the beach.
Enemy obstacles and gun positions will be there to slow down your advancement and there is a 90 percent probability of getting killed or injured during this crossing.
Orders were issued: Samantha and I were commanding two Inshore Patrol Crafts (commonly known as water jets) that carried 15 commandos each, followed by fiberglass boats carrying six commandos each. My orders to Samantha were clear: I told him that I would land first because I wanted to assess the situation.
Navy Gunboats started bombarding the beach early morning with their 37-mm guns, and we were given clearance to do the landing with the lull of heavy gunfire. Our two water jets raced towards Pooneryn beach. Two machine guns of enemy started firing at us and suddenly, Samantha increased the speed of his water jet and landed first and nullified enemy machine gun position with his grenade launchers.
I was furious at the time, however, I was happy that he destroyed enemy gun positions in quick sessions without causing casualties to our side. The landing was successful and we established the beachhead for reinforcements to arrive. The SBS was then hailed as the “Bravest of the Brave” in the navy.
After that, we returned to Karainagar that evening to rest and relax. That night I asked Samantha why he disobeyed my orders. He said with tears in his eyes, “Sir, I was afraid that you would be hit by enemy machine gun fire!” I told him that he would have had the same fate and he replied, “Sir, I can die. That’s not a concern. My father and mother will cry, but, not you! You have a wife and son.”
I was the only married person in the SBS at that time and my son was only a one-year-old then.
This was the calibre of officers whom I served with. We were fortunate commanders to have officers such as Samantha as our subordinates. They were ready to sacrifice their lives to protect us.
One day, I saw Samantha going through the Navy List. The Navy List is a book which denotes the seniority and qualifications of naval officers. I asked why he was referring the list and he said as per the seniority gap between the two of us, when I became a Rear Admiral, he would still be a Lieutenant Commander. I promised him that if were made a Rear Admiral one day, I would take him as my Flag Lieutenant [Aide-de-Camp (ADC)]. He was happy to hear that.
Before embarking on a difficult operation, I used to tell my wife Yamuna that I would be away for a few weeks and her only question to me always was, “Is Samantha Gallage going with you?” She always believed that Samantha would look after me and bring me home safely.
In 1995, Samantha got married to Nishika, a young lady officer in the navy who was a teacher at our Naval Pre-school.
Samantha died in an SBS-Army Special Forces joint operation at Nallathannithuduvai in Chalai, Jaffna, on October 20, 1996. His only son, Rumal, was only eight months old when he sacrificed his life for the territorial integrity and sovereignty of our motherland. He was awarded the Weera Wickrama Vibushanaya posthumously for his valour and bravery during this operation. His wife Nishika died of cancer in 2011, leaving young Rumal alone.
Today, 22-year-old Rumal is doing his higher studies in Australia. Keeping my promise to Samantha, I never took a flag lieutenant when I became a rear admiral on July 15, 2009. Even though Samantha is dead, I kept my promise to him.
The seat and table of Flag Lieutenant next to my office for the past nine years has been empty in honour of my friend who was ready to sacrifice his life for me.
As the Navy Commander and now as the Chief of Defence Staff and a four-star Admiral, I do not have a Flag Lieutenant; I have only Personal Security Officers (PSOs). Every time I pass this empty chair and table, it reminds me of Samantha. Lieutenant Commander (SBS) Samantha Gallage will remain as my Flag Lieutenant until the day I retire.
They will grow not old, as we that are left grow old;
Age shall not weary them, nor the years condemn.
At the going down of the Sun and in the morning
We will remember them
- Laurence Binyon (For the Fallen) Admiral Ravindra Wijegunaratne, Chief of Defence Staff
