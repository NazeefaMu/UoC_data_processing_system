Parliament has 94 MPs without O/Ls

Ninety four MPs have not passed their GEC (O/L) examination while there are only 25 graduates among the 225 legislators in the present Sri Lankan Parliament, former Chancellor of the University of Peradeniya, Prof. M O A de Zoysa said yesterday.
He observed that MPs who have been elected to make laws on behalf of the people must conduct themselves with dignity.
Addressing a media briefing held in Colombo yesterday, he said the conduct of the Joint Opposition MPs since the day the Yahapalana government came to power amounted to a contravention of parliamentary discipline.
Parliament is a place that makes laws. Its members should be dignified, with a knowledge of their subjects, logical intelligence and of impeccable conduct. But, we cannot see these qualities in most of the MPs today,” he said.Taxpayers money is being spent for the welfare of all MPs and a Rs. 2500 Special Attendance Allowance, with the luxury meals, are provided to them for one sitting. Therefore, MPs should bear in mind their responsibilities. But, everyday, when parliament meets, JO members disrupt parliament proceedings for about one or two hours. So how can parliament pass laws on behalf of the people and the country? The conduct of certain senior members is not good and it is disgusting.
They may be senior but, they have not matured. They have been given front seats to set an example to junior MPs,” he said. Senior Lecturer at the University of Sri Jayawardenapura Dr. Terrence Purasinghe said Sri Lanka follows traditions and conventions built over a long period of time in the British Parliament. Apart from these, Standing Orders have laid down how business should be conducted in the House. These are the rules that have to be followed by the MPs. But, most of the MPs do not follow them today.
