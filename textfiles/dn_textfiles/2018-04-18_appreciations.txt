Appreciations

Most Ven. Dimbulkumbure Sri Saranankara Wimaladhamma Anu Nayake Thera:
Unique service for religious and cultural resurgence
The Most Venerable Deputy Patriarch (Anu Nayake) of the Malwatte Chapter of the Siam Sect, Ven. Dimbulkumbure Sri Saranankara Wimaladhammãbhidhãna Anu Nayake Thera attained 77 years of age recently. The Ven. Anu Nayake Thera rendered unique and great service for the religious, cultural and social resurgence of the country, which will be long remembered and valued by the people of Sri Lanka and is sure to be recorded in our history in golden letters.
Seventy-seven years ago, two days after the Sinhala and Tamil New Year (April 16, 1941), a son was born to Rambandara Nilame and Dingiri Amma Menike Kumarihamy, who resided at Bajjala Walawwa in the village of Dimbulkumbure, Hanguranketha, in Nuwara Eliya district.
The boy had his basic education in the village school and later was moved to Sri Sangaraja Pirivena affiliated to Malwathu Maha Viharaya in Kandy. While he was studying as a lay student at Sri Sangaraja Pirivena, on December 30, 1965, he was ordained at Malwathu Maha Viharaya and took name Dimbulkumbure Wimaladhamma, under the tutelage of Ven. Mãtgamuwe Dhammaloka Nayake Thera, Ven. Ilukwatte Dhammananda Thera and Ven. Waturakumbure Gnanawimala Thera. He received his higher ordination on the same day at the Uposathagaraya of Malwathu Maha Viharaya.
In 1970, Ven. Wimaladhamma Thera entered the University of Colombo and obtained a special degree in History. After completing his studies, Ven. Anu Nayake Thera began his career as a teacher at Sri Nishshanka Vidyalaya in Nuwara Eliya district and later served at Dodamwala Vidyalaya in Kandy district and Ambagamuwa Vidyalaya in Nuwara Eliya. In 1986, he was promoted as the Principal of Waturakumbura Vidyalaya, Kandy and rendered an excellent service in this capacity till 2001.
After the passing away of his teachers, Ven. Wimaladhamma Thera was appointed as the Chief Incumbent of the historical temples of Gereppitiya in the Yatinuwara area and Ranawana in the Pilimatalawa area. He was entrusted with the Thewawa ceremony of Sri Dalada Maligawa, which is a highly respected task among the Buddhist monks. He was appointed to perform these religious rituals several times under the guidance of the Mahayake Theras at the time.
Ven. Thera was appointed as a member of Supreme Sangha Council (Kãraka Sangha Sabha) of the Malwatte Chapter of the Siam Sect by Royal Pandit Most Ven. Sirimalwatte Sri Ananda Mahanayake Thera. Ven. Wimaladhamma Thera has provided his invaluable service for the annual Upasampada ceremony of Malwathu Viharaya as a Karmawãgãchãrya and a Upãdyãya for several decades. He was elevated to the position of Deputy Registrar of the Malwatte Chapter in 2004. The Supreme Sangha Council of the Malwatte Chapter conferred on him the prestigious position of Anu Nayake in 2009. The Most Venerable Anu Nayake Thera was made the Chief Incumbent of the historical Royal Temple of Walgampãya in 2016.
Ven. Dimbulkumbure Sri Wimaladhamma Anu Nayake Thera who had the greatness to address all the people who came to him with a heart of loving kindness, thus living up to Buddhist social concepts, merited to be a prominent custodian of the Sacred Tooth Relic of the Buddha, which is the most sacrosanct relic of worship of the entire Buddhist world.
May the blessings of the Triple Gem be bestowed on the Anu Nayake Thera to live many more years in fostering the Sambuddha Sãsana.

Chandralekha Vijayalakshmi Mendis:
A model of patience
It has been one year since you said goodbye forever and left us. It was wonderful to see you patiently listening to bana every day and teaching us the dharma, while reminding us that sooner or later, we would leave this world. You were always ready for it, as you had given up all your worldly possessions. Even to the last day of your life, your mind was razor-sharp and you did not forget to wish your friends.
The way you looked after your parents, visiting them every month when they were living and observing sil even when you were bedridden and unable to walk, always inquiring about their health and needs, showed how patient you were with everybody around you. Now that you are no more in our midst, all that we can do is thank you for your wonderful life and to remember you today.
We will never forget you and will always cherish those happy memories when you were a part of our family. On April 16, it was be one year since you left us, but we will always keep your memory alive. Words cannot describe how much we still miss you and we continue the good deeds and meritorious activities you initiated and had been doing. May those fond memories not fade away as we complete another year since you bade goodbye.
A perfect rose among lesser flowersA golden moment among dull hoursA wonderful life—warm and trueWe think of these when we think of you
Your son, husband and all your family members
Rashi Perera:
An angel guiding us from heaven
Darling Rashi, you became my son on December 23, 1999 and you were my joy giver during your infancy. During your childhood we were playmates. When you became little bit older, with your outstanding performance in studies, sports and music, you were my achiever and entertainer. You were ever my reliable friend and advisor whenever I faced a challenge. From the day that you took your heavenly assignment on April 15, 2013, you became my special guardian angel.
Five years have passed by and all our loved ones might feel that Thaththi and Ammi (Ruwini) must be in control of that past dreadful event. But my dear Angel, you know the correct picture. Each and every time I drive to work, I still remember dropping you at school; whenever we go shopping, I still recall how you used to climb on the trolley for me to push. Each time we attend a party, I still cherish the good old days that we partnered together providing sensational music to lift the party spirit, and at church, the way you stood between us with your innocent smile. These are the cherished moments that we miss dearly. For all these times, I have only one prayer to say to the Almighty, “Thy will be done – you know what’s best.”
As a God-fearing young lad, your spiritual life on earth is indeed a great lesson to us. Your desire to be sinless while forgiving others who did injustice to you, set us an example on how to meet God’s expectations. Your great kindness for the poor, sympathy towards the needy, compassion for the under-privileged children, understanding of others’ agony, are just a few qualities that you had and are very rare to find in today’s world. Furthermore, your prayerful life with immense hope and faith in the Almighty God, exhibits your heavenly assignment on earth.
I still browse through the heaps of certificates that you were awarded for studies; remembering the hours you spent with your mother, studying vigorously to become the best in class. I still recollect the trophies you won for sports and other activities that exhibited your sheer determination, strength and endurance. Though I’m not a great musician like you, I still keep your instruments in good condition while playing a few songs to bring back your sweet memory. Darling, you are my role model who used your God-given talent to the maximum, and I’m trying my level best to keep the life back at home in filling the massive void you left behind.
My darling Rashi, at the time you were born, you were crying and we all were smiling and celebrating with absolute joy. But at the time of your demise, we were all shedding tears in sheer misery, but surely, you were smiling at that time, since you were in the heavenly realm knowing you are in a better place. Many a time when I was depressed, you appeared in my dreams to greatly console and strengthen me. Full credit for the continuity of my life since you left us five years ago, is owed to you, my son.
During the past five years, I have realised the wondrous ways in which our Lord acts in one’s life. At a time when society was testing my faith due to your sudden departure, I was privileged to become even closer to God and praise His phenomenal ways of doing things. Due to the continuous faith Ammi and I had, the Almighty gave us a beautiful son, very much like you, of whom I know, you were fully aware of well in advance. I am sure your prayers from heaven helped us to have your beautiful brother Jevon (which means ‘gift of God’).
I’m fully aware that your assignment with God is for the entire humankind, but your prayers and guidance to me, Ammi and our family is immensely valued. By now you are aware of my destiny and I seek your guidance and support to reach there and to achieve the ultimate goal of meeting you in heaven once again. Until we meet you in person in the heavenly kingdom, please do intercede for us to walk closely with our Lord, Jesus Christ.
I earnestly thank the Holy Spirit for giving me the strength and knowledge to write these few lines to you and always pray that you will be in eternal peace in the arms of Jesus and the holy ones.
Lovingly,
Thaththi (Malin Perera)
Dixon Wanigasekera:
Loving ‘Papa’ to his grandchildren
I was very saddened to hear that Dixon Wanigasekera passed away recently, while he was holidaying in Sri Lanka. I last spoke to him over the telephone, just before his 90th birthday, in Canada, where he lived with his wife Indra (who is a relative of the Corea family). The Wanigasekera family celebrated his 90th birthday in a big way.
Uncle Dixon told me he had still kept the newspaper cuttings of some articles I had written about him in the Daily News in August 1980, when I met him and his daughter Malki when they were visiting Sri Lanka at the time. Previous to that meeting, I remember meeting them when they visited Sri Lanka in 1974. They left Sri Lanka for Canada in 1967 and visited us to bid us goodbye when we were living in Maha Nuge Gardens in Colombo.
Dixon joined the Canadian National Railway and worked as a draughtsman in the Engineering Department. I also remember him being a great cook, mastering the art of Sri Lankan cuisine in Canada.
He passed away on Friday, March 30, 2018, while in Sri Lanka. He leaves behind his devoted wife, Indra, children Damayanthi (Jocelyn), Dinesh (Alisa) and Malkanthi (Gary). He was very much a loving ‘Papa’ to Matthew, Angela, Dillon and Marc. Dixon was a loving brother to nine siblings and fun-loving uncle to several nieces and nephews.
May he rest in peace in the arms of Jesus.

Freddie Alles:
A gentleman to the core
It is almost three months since our dear friend Freddie left us. Freddie left a little too early, but his was a life well lived. A chartered accountant by profession, he was more a man of automobiles than of accounts. Freddie was a walking encyclopaedia on automobiles be it vintage, classic, sports or modern luxury cars. His collection of cars included the rarest models of Rolls Royce, Borgward Isabella, DKW, Fiat, Alfa Romeo, MG, Daimler, Mercedes, Opel Rekord, Opel Kapitan, Citroen, Jaguar, Jowett Javelin and many more.
His cars were not merely for show, for he used his cars regularly, for private running all over the country and also at the many Sunday runs, which he almost never missed. Freddie used to talk fondly about how he started his collection with a Fiat 500, 4 Sri 4080 for Rs. 5000 whilst working at Hayleys and how he used to race his MG in his younger days.
After his death early this year, his friend Nimal Wimalasuriya wrote in Motormaglanka.lk: In the month of February, the classic/vintage car community of Sri Lanka lost one of its ardent fans. One could describe Freddie Alles with a myriad of titles associated with classic/vintage cars such as a collector, historian, enthusiast and even a walking encyclopaedia, but the most apt title that one could give him was ‘gentleman’.
Freddie was indeed that, a gentleman to the core. He was one of the founder members of the Mercedes Benz Club of Sri Lanka, founded in 1990 and was the President of the Club again in the year 2017, having being its President earlier too. He was one of the strongest pillars of the Mercedes Benz Club. He was also an active member of the Classic Car Club of Ceylon, a senior member of the Vintage Car Club of Ceylon, member of the Italian Car Enthusiasts Club and also a member of several international automobile clubs. Freddie was an asset to any club as he got involved in all aspects of club activities with absolute dedication and passion.
I first met Freddie long years ago at the Mercedes Benz Club and we gradually became close friends. In the last couple of years, not a day passed by where we had not contacted each other, either by phone, email or Whatsapp and I just cannot bring myself to erase those records from my phone. We exchanged messages even as late as January this year, and all those messages are still intact in my phone.
Freddie was always there for a friend and many a time when I had some little issue with an old car and phoned him to get his advice, he would be at my place, sometimes within minutes, to help me out. He made time for people and his knowledge of automobiles was amazing.
Freddie was a warm, down to earth human being. He had a habit of coming up to the car to see you off and even in his last days, suffering with acute pain, he would still walk us to the car to say goodbye. He helped car enthusiasts in every way possible, and some were barely known to him. He helped anyone who asked for help or had a problem. Freddie helped people and causes quietly. He was closely associated with the Sri Lanka Cancer Society and served in many capacities including that of its President.
His love for his family was as intense and all encompassing as his love of cars. He would often send us photos of the frequent road trips he used to take with family, of his visits to car museums and car shows from all over the world, of his beloved children and grandchildren, and of him and Shanthi, his beloved wife or of his racing days. He thought the world of his family.
The motoring fraternity lost a true motoring enthusiast; the family, a much loved husband, father, a grandfather, a brother; and we lost a true friend, a man with a golden heart.
May God bless his soul!

Most. Ven. Bellanwila Wimalarathana Thera: Simple and pure, worthy of emulation Simple flower! Though not genetically modified, Many took you for one Owing to the diversity you displayed. You were supple as a rose Yet, stood erect as a hydrangea That doesn’t bow the head to Sun, moon and rain. Though a choice flower, You maintained a low profile As a tiny Jasmine, Simple and pure too. You released your fragrance With utmost restraint, Making it almost imperceptible, Which enabled you to transcend The narrow denominational boundaries. You were as comfortable At the altar of a church, Within the precincts of a mosque, Or in a Hindu temple, As on the Mal Asanaya in a Buddhist temple. At a time when Myriads of mediocre flowers of bold hues (either planted or mushroomed) Fills the atmosphere With their strong, obnoxious scents, Absence of a worthy flower like you For emulation Is a loss the country cannot afford to suffer. Reverend Sir, May you attain Nirvana! S. S. Library Science University of Kelaniya
