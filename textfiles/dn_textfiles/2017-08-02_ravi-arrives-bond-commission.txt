Ravi arrives at Bond Commission

 
Former Finance Minister and present Foreign Affairs Minister Ravi Karunanayake arrived at the Presidential Commission of Inquiry (PCoI) investigating the Treasury bond issue, to make a statement a short while ago.
The PCoI summoned the Minister to record a statement on obtaining a lease amount of close to 8.7 million from Arjun Aloysius, the former CEO of Perpetual Treasuries, for a fifth-floor super luxury condominium apartment at the Monarch residencies.
