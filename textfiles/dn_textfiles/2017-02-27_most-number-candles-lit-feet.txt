Adriana Irene Macias Hernandez used her feet to light 11 candles and claim the Guinness World Record for "Most birthday candles lit with the feet in one minute" in front of the audience of Italy's Lo Show dei Record.
The previous record of seven was set by American Ashrita Furman, who holds multiple world records.
