Sri Lanka should rebrand as a start-up nation-SLASSCOM

Sri Lanka should rebrand as a start-up nation, through the implementation of policy reforms to facilitate a more start-up friendly culture, said newly appointed Sri Lanka Association of Software and Services Companies (SLASSCOM) Chairman, Jeevan Gnanam after their AGM.
By this move small tech and fintech companies will be encouraged and incentivized to experiment in a sandbox environment, while encouraging innovations like crowd funding to drive micro investments into the sector, he said.
Gnanam said that he has an ambitious vision to rapidly grow the country’s IT industry to Rs. 5 billion by 2022 and called for greater utilization of existing and future Free-Trade Agreements (FTA) to build bridges and deepen regional integration between public and private sectors.
Similarly, he also called for greater regional integration within Sri Lanka by encouraging local companies to set up satellite operations in Tier 2 cities or towns like Negombo and Ja-ela while also exploring the possibility of selective skilled employment migration.
“There must of course be clear and defined policies to ensure that such processes occur without disadvantaging local talent, but we also need to ensure that we are open to new, global thinking. If managed correctly, I am confident that we can strike an optimal balance that will power this industry and the economy forward,” Gnanam asserted.
Moving forward, he called for the industry to rally around a 5-point agenda focused around developing local capacity for Data Science and Artificial Intelligence, building a culture of innovation across the industry, economy and society, supporting start-ups, the promotion of regional integration internationally and locally, and the commencement of selective skilled employment immigration programmes in order to facilitate invaluable knowledge transfers.
“I am confident that the industry target to Rs. 5 billion can be achieved by 2022,” he said.
