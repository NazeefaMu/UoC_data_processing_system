Speaker must act

Speaker Karu Jayasuriya should seriously consider a proposal by Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne to consider drastic measures against members of parliament who misbehave and create chaos in the August Assembly which has now become common place . Dr. Senaratne, in the wake of Friday's unprecedented conduct of Joint Opposition members in the well of parliament where some JOs MPs went berserk after the House was adjourned, one of them occupying the Speaker's chair and another ringing the quorum bell, called upon the Speaker to consider even extreme action such as expelling members for indecorous conduct. Dr. Senaratne told journalists that it was time that drastic punitive action be taken against the un-parliamentary, indecent and outrageous behaviour by Joint Opposition members, including expulsion from parliament.
It was not long ago that Speaker Karu Jayasuriya revealed that the public have to fork out Rs. 4.6 million for each sitting day of parliament and asked members to make productive use of parliament sessions for the benefit of the people. But what the public have been witnessing right along is parliament being reduced to a farce, with even ministers not present in the House to answer questions relating to the subjects coming under their ministries. The quorum bell is rung ad nauseam, at other times, to gather the required numbers, as members are least interested in the proceedings. Debates often deteriorate into slanging matches with members hurling invective and obscenities against each other across the floor of the House. Worse, sittings are often marred by free for alls where on one occasion two MPs were seen grappling with each other on the floor, prompting the Speaker to come out with some telling observations.
For the first time ever in parliament history in this country, or, anywhere, for that matter, a group of Opposition members held a nocturnal vigil in the House of parliament with some even inebriated, and others in fancy attire, sacrileging the hallowed precinct of the August Assembly.
Things are deteriorating fast, reducing parliament proceedings to a meaningless exercise and unless some determined steps are taken to arrest the trend the day would not be far when parliament debate will be reduced to the level of a blood sport. In fact, there was an instance when a MP, a member of Buddhist clergy no less, had to be hospitalized after been manhandled by a fellow MP during a violent session, not many moons ago.
True, parliament should be a vibrant forum where MPs should express their views forcefully and with conviction. At such times heated exchanges could not be avoided. This is seen even in the House of Commons, where debates are lively. Even in the good old days there had been instances where MPs were evicted from the House for defying the Chair. Parliament should not be a dull affair and members have the right to air the grievances of their constituents forcefully and in the melee verbal clashes cannot be avoided.
But what we are seeing today in the present parliament is outright thuggery and hooliganism, which again raises the question of the quality the peoples’ representatives in our midst. Political party leaders should be squarely blamed for the deteriorating standards currently being witnessed by virtue of their nomination of unsavoury elements to occupy seats in the hallowed precincts of parliament. But the leaders themselves are in a conundrum since it is such elements that bring in the votes. Not only that, a majority of Provincial Councillors too are the progeny or siblings of current members of parliament and things can only go from bad to worse with these members waiting in the wings to occupy parliament seats in the future.
Be that as it may, the Speaker should consider the suggestion of the Minister to explore avenues for extreme measures against errant members of parliament, including their expulsion, if they persist in conduct unbecoming of an MP in the House. Certain members, it is observed, are wont to deliberately scuttle proceedings in order to get the House adjourned. Perhaps Live coverage of parliament sittings have encouraged certain members to act the way they do in order to attract attention to themselves for cheap popularity. Steps should be taken to ‘blackout’ such members so that their antics would go unnoticed. Uncouth behaviour of some of our MPs certainly spring from a lack of education. The recent revelation that more than one third of our people's representatives have not passed their GCE O/Ls is a telling indictment indeed of the quality of the material adorning parliament seats. This is in contrast to the past where parliament was home to some of the best brains produced in this country where wit, humour and parry and thrust were the hallmark of parliament debate. One hopes that sometime soon parliament will revert to those glory days where parliament galleries were held spell bound by the pearls of wisdom of those stalwarts, now long gone, replacing the billingsgate now being witnessed that passes off as parliament debates.
