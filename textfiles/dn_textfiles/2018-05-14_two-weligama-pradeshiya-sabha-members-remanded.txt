Two Weligama Pradeshiya Sabha members remanded

Two members of the Weligama Pradeshiya Sabha (PS) were arrested for creating a tense situation during the opening of the Weligama Polathumodera bridge built with JAICA aid on May 11, Weligama Police said.
The two Pradeshiya Sabha members belonging to the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP), were arrested for obstructing police duties. They were produced before the Matara Magistrate and were subsequently remanded until May 17, police said.
They added that Project Management, Youth Affairs and Southern Development Minister Sagala Ratnayake was due to open the new bridge. Before the scheduled time, Weligama Pradeshiya Sabha Chairman Pushpakumara Battage had arrived on the scene with a group PS members around 9.30 a.m. and had attempted to unveil the memorial plaque of the new bridge, arguing that the project had been launched by former President Mahinda Rajapaksa.
A tense situation began when police took steps to remove the said members from the location.
Minister Sagala Ratnayake later arrived with other invitees and formally opened the bridge.
The minister, speaking to the media, said it was natural for succeeding governments to carry out development work initiated by previous regimes to a conclusion and to open them for public benefit. He said the Southern Expressway project, which was previously launched by Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe, was opened by President Mahinda Rajapaksa.
They were now opening the bridge launched by Rajapaksa, after completing it. The Right To Information Act had enabled people to inquire on the waste of funds made by the previous regime, to hold tamashas to mark opening ceremonies. The present government did not incur unnecessary expenditures for opening ceremonies of the nature as every possible saving was made to provide public relief. Unlike the Rajapaksa regime, the present government did not engage in deceitful politics, he added.
Japanese Ambassador Kenichi Sugunama was also present on the occasion. After the opening ceremony, Minister Sagala Ratnayake, accompanied by the Japanese Ambassador and other invitees, inspected three more bridges under construction in the area with Japanese aid.
