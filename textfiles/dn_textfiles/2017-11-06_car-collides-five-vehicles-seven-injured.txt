Car collides with five vehicles, seven injured

A car driven by a woman had collided with five vehicles within a 200-metre distance in the Vijaya Rajadahana area, on November 4 Mirigama injuring seven persons. The injured were admitted to the Mirigama Hospital.
An injured, a three wheel driver and father of three, was transferred to the Wathupitiwala Hospital and from there to the Colombo National Hospital.
The driver and her son are among the injured.
The car driven from the Vijaya Rajadahana Housing Complex had brushed against a car and two motorcycles, sped past the Vijaya Rajadahana level crossing and collided with two three wheelers parked aside of the Pasyala-Mirigama Road before running off the road and crashing into a wayside Mango tree.
Mirigama police said the car would have crashed since its driver may have mistakenly pressed the accelerator instead of the brakes.
Police said the driver would be arrested and produced in court.
