Railway Department amends rail timetable

 
The Department of Railways has amended the rail timetable for the first time in eleven years.
The revised timetable was unveiled at a ceremony at the Transport and Civil Aviation Ministry yesterday, where Minister Nimal Siripala de Silva received the first copy.
The Railway Department said the new timetable was necessary to better manage increasing train services and railways stations.
Currently, 396 trains and 25 rail buses run daily.
Sri Lanka Railway General Manager B. A. P. Ariyarathne said commuters would be able to purchase the new timetable at the main railway stations from next month.
