Reading shapes society for the better: Akila

The Ministry of Education is proud to support the return of the world’s biggest book sale to Sri Lanka, Education Minister Akila Viraj Kariyawasam said.
The 24-hour book sale is currently underway in Colombo for the second year in a row, showcasing an array of books from renowned authors, at discounts.
Speaking on the progress the book sale had made so far, Minister Kariyawasam said, “The Big Bad Wolf Book Sale brings us a considerable advantage, giving Sri Lankans an opportunity to access affordable English books. The wide variety of books encourages the habit of reading for whoever visiting the sale; not just for adults, but for children as well; to cultivate a lifelong love for books. We are pleased to support a sale of this calibre, offering high-quality books to broaden the horizons of the public.”
Kariyawasam stated, “English is a global language and the demand for English fluency is stronger now more than ever. Reading English books helps one improve their vocabulary and grammar, while expanding their imagination, shaping a better society in the long run.”
Creating a culture of reading is essential for any society, and the Big Bad Wolf Book Sale has made this their mission for years by taking affordable books around the world. With Sri Lanka having the privilege of being another country from the region to experience the event, the Education Ministry encourages all Sri Lankans to make the best of the opportunity to read more, he added.
The event also attracted many other public figures such as Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe and his wife Maitree Wickremasinghe.
The Big Bad Wolf Book Sale offers free entry and is being held at the Sri Lanka Exhibition and Convention Centre (SLECC) until July 8.
