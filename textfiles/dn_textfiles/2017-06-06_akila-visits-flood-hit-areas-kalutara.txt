Akila visits flood-hit areas in Kalutara

Authorities asked to preserve Fa Hien Cave:
Education Minister Akila Viraj yesterday touring flood-ravaged sites in Kalutara District instructed the archaeological authorities to take measures to conserve legendary Fa-Hien Cave in Pahiyangala.
The minister instructed the authorities to restore the historic cave after he inspected the site during his tour of Kalutara.
The “Pahiyangala” is so named after Chinese Buddhist monk Fa Hien, who, according to historical records, travelled by foot from China to India, visiting Buddhist sites in Pakistan, Nepal, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka in the early fifth century (between 399-412).
He is said to have journeyed these countries to acquire Buddhist scriptures of the Vinaya Pitaka.
