Lahiru aims for  USD 100 mn with  ‘tech-savvy’ Lankans

Meeting Point
Lahiru Pathmalal is the Chief Executive Officer (CEO) and co-founder of Takas.lk. A past student of Colombo International School (CIS) he obtained his Bachelor’s degree in political science from University of Maryland USA, and master’s degree in International Relations from University of Queensland, Australia. Lahiru takes pride in being a Sri Lankan, and is the only CEO, we have met thus far- who has his business card printed in English, Tamil and Sinhala.
Extracts;
1. Your education and family background?
I schooled at CIS. My parents are engaged in the manufacture and retail of shoes. So I had a good understanding of what it is to please a customer from an early age. I have done my bachelors and masters degree.
2. How did you come up with the idea to start ‘Takas.lk’?
As you can see I have lived and travelled overseas for 8 years. In these countries lots of people purchase their requirements online. I was working at the Neelan Thiruchelvam ICES dealing with democracy and policy. It was during this time, in 2012 that two of my friends Dilendra Wimalasekera and Murtaza Moosajee came up with the idea of an online shopping portal. With regard to our name it was my friend Ravi Wijesinghe, who is very creative, who gave us the name “takas”- to show the rapid access consumers can have on our website.
3. What drove you to start your own business rather than join the already established family business?
As you know Gigi shoes is our family business, built over the years by my father Sarath Pathmalal. One day I was looking online and wanted to buy a TV, but I could not find one. It was then that I realized that there could be thousands of others searching for various products online- and I realized the potential in this dormant market for online shopping. There were not many online shopping options in Sri Lanka.
4. Can you walk us through the process of starting ‘Takas.lk’?
In any business it takes planning. It also takes investment. We began takas.lk with what we call an “angel investment”. We had to convince them that this is a viable market that would yield profits. This entire operation is very high- tech, an almost automated process. At the start it was hard to get and maintain suppliers, but today 5 years later we are ahead of our game and have a product range of between 8000- 13,000 items.
We don’t have to maintain stores, as we liaise well with all our suppliers. E- Commerce is a daily evolving field and we strive to stay ahead and are always updating. We did face challenges- as in any business but we moved forward. I value every member of my team and we reward out exceptional performers with shares, to inspire them and give them a sense of ownership.
5. In a day where many similar websites and services exist how do you keep up or out do the competition?
Yes we have to always satisfy our customers and understand their purchasing trends. The customers drive us to stay ahead in the game. Some refer to us as the amazon.com of Sri Lanka. Access to information of all the products we sell is also vital. Our fast moving area is electronics- especially mobile phones and computer accessories.
6. What is the future of the industry?
There is great potential for this industry. Today we have also tied up with companies that provide the ‘digital wallet’ service. There are approximately 1.4 million credit card users in Sri Lanka. We will penetrate this market. We have improved our delivery service (which is outsourced to courier companies). Sri Lankans are becoming more ‘tech-savvy’ and the world is one large digital domain. We hope to increase our revenue to 80- 100 million dollars over the next five years.
7. What can be done to improve and enable youth who are interested in starting their own businesses?
Sri Lankan youth have great talent. They must be empowered to succeed, in any chosen field. We must break the culture of dependency. Over the last few years many young people have gone overseas, in search of greener pastures, and established themselves, in various fields of work. We must not give into any racism and segregation- we are all Sri Lankans. I am disappointed to see so many young men driving 3 wheelers (tuk-tuk). They have no other skill and they will remain stagnant for life. We must make way for creativity. People are often skeptical when you want to start something new- but you must take a risk. We also have to welcome skilled foreigners- example in America that is the strength and diversity of that nations sustained progress. We must allow foreigners will good skills to legally work here and not be insecure and petty minded. We can learn from their experience.
8. What advice would you like to give youngsters aiming to start their own business?
Success, in any field takes time. There is a period of challenges and waiting. You must not give up, persistence pays off. You must understand your customers. Success is built over months or years. If there is no risk- there is no reward. It takes time to create true value.
