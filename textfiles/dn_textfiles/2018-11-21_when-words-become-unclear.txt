When words become unclear

Through his eyes, the gateway, he perceives the wondrous Universe around him. And then with the passing of time, a mysterious, miraculous, marvellous and little-understood connection takes place within him. It could be instantaneous and it could take months. But his soul, his mind, his thoughts and his feelings are knitted together like a baby being conceived in the womb, and an image grows in his mind and through his hands, he draws it on the canvas. This is Expressions 15 by Jayantha Silva. Sometimes what passes through the eyes may take months to bloom after being planted in the psyche and sometimes it could take place within a few minutes.
“Anyone can be a good artist, as everyone has good eyesight, muscle control, and the ability to observe and appreciate a subject. I enjoy doing paintings with charcoals, pastels and acrylics. Many are going into art as a profession to cater to the growing demand of the public to purchase original art for their domestic and corporate locations,” said Silva.
Body glistening
Silva’s paintings are truly beautiful. When wandering through his gallery you cannot fail to notice the mermaid picture, a glorious representation of Silva’s appreciation of the nude. This is Silva’s appreciation of the natural world specifically to do with lore. A mermaid is a creature of fantasy yet Silva brings her to live in our minds – her bronze larger than life body glistening in the water.
The mermaid is not the only subject of femininity in his gallery. The female figure is the subject of many of his paintings and Silva is a master of painting figures. The Universe is his teacher. It enters into his soul, imperiously commanding the gates which are his eyes to receive it, and mingling with his soul, thoughts and feelings, it produces something which is original.
“I feel that ‘the Woman’ alone is not the theme of my paintings. The main theme of my paintings is “Expression”. As womanhood is associated with the most intense emotions, there are various reasons to prefer female figures over the male. Since childhood I was always passionate about the study of the female figure,” stated Silva.
Silva is a believer in God. To him, his work is an act of providence. Silva states that he is an artist because of the tremendous amount of self- confidence he has. He says that it is no doubt a Gift of God - making him fearless to draw.
Paintings based on myth
“My mermaid picture is a good example of what I am trying to say. There are many famous artists who have done paintings based on myth. Some have painted Unicorns, Cupids and even the imaginary God of Thunder. I suppose it’s a way how an Artist lets his or her imagination run riot,” explains Silva.
Silva also never fails to include even the most minute details such as the nails of hands and feet.
The contours of the human body he captures well. The expressions on the faces of some of his subjects are so detailed you can make your own interpretation as to what that person may be thinking or feeling. His portraits are so human. So lifelike. So personal.
Silva values his freedom and gives free rein to his creativity. He is shackled down by nothing. He is bold and forever looking to express himself. Throughout the years he has done just that. Exhibition after the exhibition and surely many more to come. Because he is a man with something to say and he does that by painting.
Silva’s 15th Annual Solo Exhibition will be held once again at the Lionel Wendt from November 23 to 25.
