IATA renews SriLankan IOSA registration

SriLankan Airlines as part of its efforts to maintain the highest standards as the trademark national carrier has renewed its registration under the IATA Operational Safety Audit (IOSA) for 2016-2017 in conformity with standards introduced by the International Air Transport Association (IATA).
IOSA assesses the airline on eight operational scopes. The audit is conducted by an IATA accredited audit organization, in accordance with the IOSA I Program Manuals, and the standards that are published in IOSA Standard Manuals. Even though the assessment mainly focuses on operational areas, it also includes accountability of organizational management functions relevant to aviation safety.
The IATA Operational Safety Audit (IOSA) program is an internationally recognized and accepted evaluation system designed to assess the operational management and control systems of an airline.
IOSA Registered Airlines are subject to renewal assessments every 24 months. All IATA members are IOSA registered and must remain registered to maintain IATA membership. SriLankan Airlines first attained the IOSA operator status in 2006 has retained its registration since then.
