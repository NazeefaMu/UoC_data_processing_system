Cultural Ministry conserves over 3,600 Ola manuscripts

Under the ancient Ola leaf manuscript national conservation project, more than 3,600 Ola manuscripts belonging to Gampaha District Buddhist temples have been conserved for use of future generations by the Cultural Ministry.
Under the first phase of the project, 3,600 Ola manuscripts have been selected for conservation from 55 temples.
The Centre Cultural Fund would release the first volume the of the national Ola manuscripts list in due course after enclosing the contents of the conserved manuscripts to it.
But most of the Ola manuscripts are deteriorating for several reasons, including the lack of proper conservation methods and poor storing.
In ancient times, valuable data including religious teachings, Aurvedic medical systems and much valuable knowledge in many fields, were conserved with the Ola manuscripts for the future.
But there was no proper mechanism to protect or conserve them.
Having considered this situation, the project was started under the guidance of Education Minister Akila Viraj Kariyawasam. Under this national project, motions are underway to identify valuable Ola manuscripts countrywide.
