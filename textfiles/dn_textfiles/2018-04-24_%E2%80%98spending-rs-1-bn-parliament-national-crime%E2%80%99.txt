‘Spending Rs. 1 bn on Parliament, a national crime’

Spending Rs. 1 billion for the renovation of Parliament, the amount of which is enough to construct 80 udagammana model villages consisting of 2,000 houses is a national crime, said Housing and Construction Minister Sajith Premadasa.
The minister made this observation at the opening ceremony of the 57th model village - Mihindumgama in Kirigangkumbura, Ududumbara, under the government’s project to open 2,500 model villages by 2020.
He also said that the people vote once every five years to elect politicians to govern the country on behalf of them.
“They do so and elect members to get their issues addressed and not to get suppressed more and more,” said Minister Premadasa. “I learnt recently that Rs. 1 billion is to be spent for the renovation work of Parliament which seems to me a national crime.”
Minister Premadasa said further that such an amount of money is sufficient construct 2,000 houses and that is 80 villages with 25 housing units each. “The construction of houses for the poor should be at the top of the list of the development projects in the country and not the renovation of Parliament,” Minister Premadasa said.
“Such an amount of money at least could be utilised to feed those suffering from malnutrition, provide drinking water to deprived people, grant plots of lands to those who are deprived of land, or provide employment opportunities to the unemployed graduates. We have prepared the development plan by listening to the people.”
