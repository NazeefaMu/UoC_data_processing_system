President to open Rajagiriya flyover on January 8

President Maithripala Sirisena will vest the Rajagiriya flyover with the public on January 8, providing long-term solutions for the heavy traffic congestion in the Rajagiriya area.
Even though the construction work of the flyover was scheduled to be completed by the end of this year, steps were taken under the guidance of the President to complete the construction work 11 months ahead of schedule for the convenience of the public.
The construction work of the flyover commenced in 2016, jointly under a Spanish company and a local company. Rs. 4,700 million was spent for this project.
The length of the flyover is 533 metres and the width is 21.4 metres. It consists of four lanes - two lanes each way.
Parallel to this project, several roads around the Rajagiriya area will be developed and an alternative road towards Narahenpita as well as the road towards Buthgamuwa will be developed with a total of three lanes.
The flyover, built using high standard modern technology as well as in accordance with high-quality engineering, will be added to our roadways history as the first flyover constructed filling a concrete surface on metal.
During the times of heavy traffic congestions in Rajagiriya, the speed of vehicles movement on this road is slower than 2 kilometres per hour. After the completion of this flyover, it is expected that the speed limit of vehicles to be increased by eightfold. The flyover can be considered as one of the most significant road development projects implemented by the present Government under the leadership of President Maithripala Sirisena, providing the benefits of sustainable development to the country. It is also considered as an important milestone in the process of strengthening the economy of the country.
