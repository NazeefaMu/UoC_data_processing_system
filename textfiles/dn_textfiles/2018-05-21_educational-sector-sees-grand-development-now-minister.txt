“We have established 2,000 educational zones, 300 smart class rooms and 10,000 schools. Many of them have electricity facilities. We have appointed 4,000 principals, 852 SLEAS Officers and 1,296 graduates. Within three and half years, we accomplished a great deal of development activities in the sector,” the Minister said.
He said Tamil and Muslim people in the north and east suffered untold hardships during the war. “The President and the Prime Minister were aware that the two communities are supporting the Good Governance Government and they must be helped achieve their goals in life,” he said.
“Education in the country declined very much within the last three decades.We have now put it back in progress. The department has taken measures to train graduates in teaching before appointing them to schools. They will be recruited as assistant teachers. Over Rs. 8,000 million was allocated to provide labs for 3,000 schools and Rs 700 million to provide library books for Eastern Provincial schools.
The Minister said 26 subjects were taught now at schools and Science and Math were made compulsory. “Our educational system is in line with international standard now. If the Good Governance Government continues, the educational sector will improve very much. GCE (A/L) students will be provided with laptops. Drinking water facilities were provided for 26,000 schools and 6,000 school building were constructed,” he said.
The Minister was honoured with a memento by Government Teachers” College Principal B. Paramesweran.
