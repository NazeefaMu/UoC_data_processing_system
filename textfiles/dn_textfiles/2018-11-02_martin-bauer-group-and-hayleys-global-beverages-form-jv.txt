Martin Bauer Group and Hayleys Global Beverages form JV

Sri Lankan multinational Hayleys PLC and Germany’s botanicals giant Martin Bauer Group (MBG) announced a historic joint venture partnership in Hayleys Global Beverages (Pvt) Ltd (HGBL).
“We are very excited to announce our investment into Hayleys Global Beverages and our new role as joint venture partners together with the renowned Hayleys Group and KVPL,” said Albert Ferstl, Managing Director of MBG.
“High quality tea ingredients are increasingly demanded for numerous applications. Given the superior reputation of Pure Ceylon Tea and the fact that our green leaf is directly, sustainably and responsibly sourced, with the majority from Hayleys’ own estates, we are able to create a product of the highest quality. We therefore look forward to a fruitful and long-lasting partnership,”
Established in 2016, HGBL stands among Sri Lanka’s most sophisticated manufacturers of authentic Pure Ceylon Tea extracts — primarily in the form of powders, concentrates aromas and flavors. MBG is considered a worldwide leader in high-quality botanical products to supply the global tea, food and phyto pharmaceutical Industries with teas, extracts, powders and botanical ingredients.
The demand for tea and herbal ingredients is forecasted to grow due to the rising consumer consciousness towards personal health.
“We are extremely proud to announce the historic partnership between the Hayleys Group and Germany’s Martin Bauer Group: one of the world’s most respected and successful players in the international botanicals market. Their investment serves as further validation of the immense potential that we see for Hayleys Global Beverages moving forward”, Hayleys PLC Chairman and Chief Executive, Mohan Pandithage stated.
“More importantly, a joint venture with such a prestigious and respected global leader as the Martin Bauer Group also presents unprecedented business opportunity”.
