Reforms must bring about economic freedom: Anura Kumara

The country should have reforms to bring about justice, equality and freedom in economy, Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) leader Anura Kumara Dissanayake yesterday said.
The JVP leader was speaking at a meeting held at the National Youth Service Council Auditorium, Maharagama.
He said the political parties that come into power do not have genuine need in this regard. They are only interested in ensuring perks and privileges for themselves, he said.
“Ten per cent of the population with the lowest income rate get only 1.1 per cent of the GDP, while the 10 per cent of the population with the highest income rate enjoy a 38.4 per cent of the GDP,” Anura Kumara said.
“Although the per capita income in the country is USD 4,300, 42 per cent of the population receive an income of USD 730. Sri Lanka was elevated to a lower middle income country that exceeds USD 4,000 annually. But 42 per cent receive below USD 730,” he said.
MP Anura Kumara said that over 61 per cent of the population are indebted to official institutions and ten per cent of the houses in the country are below 250 square feet. “How could a family live in a house so small?” MP Dissanayake asked.
“People should be given the dividends of the development. The government has to ensure a mechanism that would uplift people’s economy,” he said.
Anura Kumara said the Western Province contributes 52 per cent of the GDP while the North Western Province gives 9 per cent and the North Central Province 4 per cent. “It shows inequality of the development,” he said.
“As many as 3,363 persons had committed suicide in 2017. Now Sri Lanka has recorded the fourth highest suicides in the world. Many in Jaffna commit suicide over their indebtedness,: he said.
MP Dissanayake said the situation must be changed or the country would be in economic chaos before long.
“This government does not make reforms that the public need,” MP Dissanayake said.
