High quality transport service in the offing

A high quality transport service will be one of the yardsticks of the sustainable development of Sri Lanka, which is now on a path to development. Railway service will be a powerful transport medium in this respect, said Transport and Civil Aviation Minister Nimal Siripala de Silva.
The Minister said this at a workshop on the proposed Colombo Suburban Railway network held at the Waters Edge, Battaramulla on November 17.
Minister de Silva said the development of the Colombo Suburban Railway network was one of the main objectives of the government which had identified the contribution expected from the Sri Lanka Railways towards a national transport network.
As such, the government had planned to launch this project in collaboration with the Asian Development Bank. Under this project the Kelani valley railway line would be developed as a double line with a modern signal system from Maradana up to Padukka.
Furthermore, the treble line from Maradana to Ragama would be developed as a quadruple line and the double line from Veyangoda to Rambukkana would be developed as a triple line.
It had also been planned to develop the Coastline Railway from Colombo Fort to Panadura as a triple line instead of the present double line.
At present, a feasibility study was being done on the Kelani valley line and a report was being prepared to evict unauthorised settlers along the railway line and settle them on suitable alternative places. The Minister said he would request officials to undertake these projects systematically.
