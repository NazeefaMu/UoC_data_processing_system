INCLUSIVE COOPERATION IN THE INDIAN OCEAN REGION

Profound and complex changes are taking place in the current world regarding geopolitical and economic circumstances, with opportunities and challenges driving ahead. During the 19th National Congress of the Communist Party of China, Chinese President Xi Jinping called on the people of all countries to work together with other friendly countries toward a new form of international relations featuring mutual respect, fairness, justice, and win-win cooperation and a community with a shared future for mankind, and work together with the people of all countries to build an open, inclusive, clean, and beautiful world that enjoys lasting peace, universal security, and common prosperity.
Every country should respect each other, discuss issues as equals, resolutely reject the cold war mentality and power politics, and take a new approach to develop state-to-state relations with communication, not confrontation, and partnership, not alliance. Indian Ocean Region (IOR) keeps a good momentum while immense unsteadiness and uncertainties parasitize. China has always devoted itself to safeguarding peace and stability of IOR and promoting common development for IOR featuring harmony, cooperation and win-win result. China insists on that inclusive cooperation is the sole path for a bright future of IOR.
Carrying forward the Thousand-Year Silk Road
Thousands of years ago, China and Indian Ocean (IOR) countries started cultural exchanges and trade. Throughout history, the Chinese civilization reached the world and Chinese learned from the outside world by its endless fleet of ships, resulting in the “Maritime Silk Road”, which benefited generations by generations with its connectivity.
The Ancient Maritime Silk Road founded itself the artery of transportation for Asia, Europe and Africa. Faced with harsh conditions, countless envoys, monks and dealers of dynasties made their way to the West on this artery to learn and to trade. Therefore, the abundant products and advanced production tools were introduced to IO countries. Moreover, the Chinese civilization including Confucius thoughts, laws and regulations, clothing, plantation, architecture and relevant technologies reached the IO coast, which propelled its economic development and social progress. Meanwhile, Buddhism, agro-products and crafts from IOR, were introduced to China along the Silk Road.
The long-standing trade, culture and people-to-people exchanges never ceased away but were renewed with long time river. More than 600 years ago, Chinese navigator Zheng He, heading fleets of over 200 ships and 27,000 crew members, travelled to the West Pacific and IO for 7 times and made himself a legend in this Region. The giant fleets visited more than 30 countries including Sri Lanka, India and Kenya. Zheng He stayed in Sri Lanka as Envoy for 5 times. The voyage of Zheng He largely deepened relations between China and Southeast Asia, South Asia, Central East and African countries. Since the fleet of Zheng He experienced a few fights against the pirates, they enjoyed generally freedom and security of navigation in most time of their voyages.
Deepening cooperation and bound together
Under the context of globalization, IOR in some sense has ever become one of the global prosperous centers. Moreover, South Asia becoming the most promising Sub-Continent in the 21st Century. Fortunately, Alfred Thayer Mahan's prediction made in 1890 that “Whoever controls the Indian Ocean will dominate Asia” might not be realized, because no one could dominate the IO and common development and sharing are the main trend which will be sustained.
With a vast territory, China shares borders with 5 countries from South Asia and most southwest provinces of China hold intimate geographical ties with South Asian countries and deeper and longer linkage with their South Asia neighbours than with eastern Asian countries. Being not only the good neighbour and friend of inter-dependent and mutual support for South Asia countries, China is inseparable for South Asia and IRO. Future and destiny of China and IO countries are closely linked together. Viewing from this perspective, China is definitely part of South Asia and IO.
Since 2014, President of the People’s Republic of China Xi Jinping made historic visits to South Asian countries including Sri Lanka, Maldive, Bangladesh and Pakistan, starting a new chapter for good neighbourly and friendly relations.
China has ever deepened practical cooperation with South Asian countries in the field of sustainable development, trade and economic cooperation, people-to-people exchanges, combating pirates, alleviating poverty and disaster relief, etc. Trading volume between China and South Asian countries witnessed a rapid growth, which reached 110.7 billion USD in 2016, accounting for 3.2% of total trading volume for China with the world. In recent five years, China has provided more than 10,000 scholarships and training opportunities for South Asia countries. Referring to Sri Lanka, China provided 1,300 scholarships and training opportunities in 2015, 1500 in 2016 and this figure has exceeded 2000 for 2017. For a consecutive of three years, Sri Lanka received more foreign-aid training resources from China than any other country.
China is a great trade power. Nearly 40% of its foreign trade goods has to transport through Indian Ocean shipping line. Each year, more than 5,000 merchant ships depart from China or travel to China through the route, navigating around South Asia, the Middle East, Africa and Europe. Safeguarding the freedom of navigation and security in the Indian Ocean are major interests and concerns of China.
China stands as a major force for the development, peace and stability in the Indian Ocean Region. China actively participates in the UN’s escort missions and anti-piracy operations in the Gulf of Aden. By 2016, China has dispatched 25 batches of naval fleets, 78 vessels, 54 helicopters and 21,000 people to conduct escort missions for about 6,300 Chinese and foreign passing ships. China successfully rescued over 60 vessels in distress by then. It fully embodies China’s effective exercise of maintaining freedom of navigation and security and the responsibility of major power. China shares the common fate with the regional countries consistently. China is also an active member of ReCAAP (Regional Cooperation Agreement on Combating Piracy and Armed Robbery against Ships in Asia) which covers more than 30 countries along the Indo-Pacific Region including ASEAN nations, Australia, Sri Lanka, Japan, Korea, India, Pakistan, Denmark, Netherlands, UK, US and etc,.
As the China’s Governor of the ReCAAP, I envisioned the cooperation on combating piracy and safeguard the navigation freedom in Indian Ocean. As one of the vital users of the Indian Ocean shipping lane, China has proved that no country is more eager than China to maintain a peaceful and secure, united and cooperative, and prosperous Indian Ocean family. China will continue its commitment to enhance relations with countries in the Indian Ocean region, making positive contributions to promoting regional peace, stability and prosperity.
Soon after the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami, Chinese government provided humanitarian emergency assistance to the affected countries along the Indian Ocean coast, donating CNY 522 million (Rs. 12 billion) in total and sending medical rescue teams and professional rescue units to help the affected countries to carry out rescue and reconstruction. Chinese society and public also donated CNY 290 million (Rs. 6.6 billion) to the victims in the disaster areas. For the past two years, China has provided a great deal of assistance for the drought and floods in Sri Lanka every year, amounting to Rs. 940 million, and committed itself to the reconstruction.
I noticed seriously that Alice Wells, Acting Assistant Secretary of the State of the United States, recently claimed in the Congress that unsustainable debt burdens for Sri Lanka were made out of Chinese non-concessional loans. It is completely unfounded statement. Instead, she stated that the United States was the largest grant provider of assistance to Sri Lanka. In fact, most of Chinese loans to Sri Lanka are concessional, with a fixed rate of 2.0%, and Chinese government has to provide a large amount of financial subsidies on interest payment.
Economic and social development in Sri Lanka
China's concessional loans support projects including hydro-projects, power plants, roads, railways, ports, airports and other infrastructure building, playing an important role for the economic and social development of Sri Lanka. As a developing country, China has done its utmost to help developing countries through bilateral cooperation and South-South cooperation mechanisms. Since the establishment of diplomatic relations, China's total assistance to Sri Lanka has amounted to more than CNY 10 billions (Rs.220 billion). From 2014 to 2017, China offered CNY 1.5 billion (Rs.33 billion) as aid given gratis to Sri Lanka, and China will offer CNY 2 billion (Rs.47 billion) to Sri Lanka from 2018 to 2020. The Chinese granted projects, such as Bandaranaike Memorial International Conference Hall, Nelum Pokuna Theatre, Kidney disease hospital, Cancer funds etc., serve Sri Lanka society and public well and for sure, it is obvious to all. China always respects Sri Lanka's sovereignty and internal affairs, offering aid given gratis without any attached political conditions, only requiring it to be used for people's livelihood and benefit the general public as much as possible.
According to the United Nations resolution, developed countries are urged to donate their 0.7% of GDP on providing assistance to developing countries. In fact, most countries, except some European countries like the Netherlands, Denmark and Norway, did not fulfill their obligations. Chinese people are most against those who are rich but not benevolent, and Chinese culture promotes “kindness, harmony and relief”. China will continue to do what we can and what we promise, in helping developing countries including Sri Lanka, in the way of action rather than “Carrots plus Sticks” or talking approach.
