Pyre awaits…

White sand is sprinkled along the path leading to the resting ground. Bare bodied few men, their sun burnt dark skin glistening with the perspiration are busily covering the ‘home’ with thin white sheets, the edges being smoothly done with graceful patterns. From the distance, the drumming is faintly heard. Slowly it increases as it approaches the resting ground. Men and women clad in white are walking slowly as if in a procession, carrying a box of memories, rotting and cold.
Once there was life, sunshine and smiles, but no more, except a loneliness like the emptiness of a cloudless sky. Once it was a body, so carefully toned, moisturized, trimmed and well taken care of, but no more, except a coldness like an icy piece of refrigerated meat.
Soon there would be a lit torch. Soon there would be flames, overpowering the wind, diminishing the ‘home’ of thin white sheets, along with its intricate patterns. The box of memories would soon be perished to ashes.
The pyre awaits!
