Stop stirring your tea!

We all think we know how to make the perfect cuppa.
Every now and then, someone new comes out claiming that we’ve all been making it wrong, throwing us into a tea-stained fug of confusion.
But few are more qualified to tell us how tea should be made than a member of The Royal Household.
According to former royal butler Grant Harrold, there’s a particular method of brewing a cup worthy of the Queen herself.
He revealed the four steps to the perfect royal cup on BBC Three series, Miss Holland:
Pour the tea into the cup from a teapot
Add milk to the cup after the tea – never before
Stir back and forth – never a circular motion and never touching the sides
Sip – don’t slurp – from the cup
Most of that sounds pretty obvious. Only a maniac would add milk before the tea. But a large percentage of us probably do swirl our tea around and that’s where we’re apparently going wrong.
“If we stir in a circular motion, we can create a storm in a teacup and see the tea coming over the sides which we should never allow,” Harrold explains to Business Insider.
“If the spoon touches the sides, it makes a clinging sound and we don’t want that at the afternoon tea table.”
As for the Queen’s favourite brew, she enjoys loose tea Assam or Earl Grey, made with tea leaves in a teapot. Oh and Harrold has been clearing up another bone of contention – how to eat scones.
“The royal way to eat a scone is to either cut it with a knife or break it with your hands and put the cream on first and then the jam. If her majesty was visiting Cornwall she would spread the jam on first then the cream, or in Devon, it would be cream first then jam, because that is the way they do it and she is a very diplomatic lady.”
