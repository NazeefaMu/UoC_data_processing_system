The Jury speaks

The judgment was not easy. It took hours. Any jury member will experience such an entanglement owing to the conflict of interest in personal choices. For the Jury of the recently concluded SAARC Film Festival, however, it was not that hard. They have known each other taking part in many film festivals before.
António Costa Valente from Portugal, Anne Démy-Geroe from Australia and Amir Masoud Soheili from Iran knew each other well, despite varied tastes, concerns, likes and dislikes. They brainstormed all that for hours and broke down the reasons to come to a conclusion. And finally, they reached consensus.
With a doctorate in cinema, António Costa Valente lectures at the University of Aveiro, UTAD. Dr Valente also teaches cinema at other universities in Austria, Brazil, El Salvador, Spain, USA, France, Ireland, Japan, Morocco, United Kingdom, Sao Tome and Principe and Switzerland. He has produced and co-directed the first Portuguese animated feature film To the Top of the World. Anne Démy-Geroe, a film curator cum expert of Asian cinema teaches Asia Pacific Cinema at Griffith Film School. She is a co-Director of the Iranian Film Festival Australia, an inaugural member of the Nominations Council for the Asia Pacific Screen Awards, a Vice President of NETPAC - the Network for the Promotion of Asia Pacific Cinema, and a Co-Director of APSL - Asia Pacific Screen Lab.
Amir Masoud Soheili has earned global reputation, having taken part in hundreds of film festivals around the world as a director as well as a jury member. He is widely known in the cinema fraternity for his short films. Soheili, the youngest member of the SAARC Film Festival 2017 Jury, speaks to the Daily News offers his analysis on the festival.
“It was really difficult to select the most special film. All the films were good. Our discussion dragged on for hours. Finally, we settled down for Pinkey Beauty Parlour because we could see everything consummate there. Directing, writing, acting and music was simply perfect. The movie made a real impression,” Soheili elaborated why Akshay Singh’s debut film Pinkey Beauty Parlour, which opened the festival, was given the Special Jury Award.
A festival is quite resourceful for any filmmaker. The films will be screened before a special audience and a jury. Meeting fellow filmmakers is a bonus benefit of taking part in a film festival. While commenting positively about film festivals, Soheili nevertheless had his own concerns.
“They have a particular taste. They have a particular concern. The filmmakers try to base their productions on the festival objectives. Then they lose their own theme for the sake of festivals. This makes the filmmaker forget about the general audience.”
Yet a filmmaker needs festivals to flourish. The master class, held during the festival, enlightened the up and coming filmmakers on the methodology of submitting their cinema entries to international film festivals.
“A few years ago, even the short films were unthinkable. But now it is possible largely thanks to the DSLR camera and high-resolution smartphones. Many filmmakers enter the industry with their first attempt at a short film. It is the easiest way to enter the mainstream cinema. A lot of festivals also encourage short films. The short films have many avenues open. Online channels are one of them. You can also earn some money.”
With short film as his main forte, Soheili is trying to experience different elements in cinema. Among the similarities shared across the South Asian region, Soheili attempts to explore the subtle differences.
“It is a challenging experience. But we need to bridge the cultures in Asia. Cinema is the best medium to execute that.”
Long before Soheili reached Sri Lanka, he was familiar with the island’s cinema territory. Recalling his acquaintance with Vimukthi Jayasundera a few years ago, Soheili noted that he learned a lot from his Lankan counterpart.
“Most South Asian countries have a problem with finding their own way of storytelling and filmmaking. Most countries of the South Asian region tend to follow the Bollywood style. Yet, I have observed that Sri Lankan cinema has its own voice. The Sri Lankan filmmakers have found their own voice. Filmmaking seems to be quite established in Sri Lanka whereas most other countries try to imitate either Hollywood or Bollywood style.”
Soheili has his own reservations about the festivals.
“I am a bit concerned about the way the films had been selected. We had no chance to watch a Bhutanese film, for one. And most other countries have chosen the commercial films. The films had been nominated by the government, that’s good. But these countries have produced better films. It looks like they haven’t searched extensively. All the SAARC countries have short films as well, though only a few countries cared to submit them.”
Soheili is hopeful that the SAARC Film Festival will rise to a richer plain of cinema experience in its 2018 edition.
