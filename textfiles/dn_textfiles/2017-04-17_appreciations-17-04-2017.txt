[APPRECIATIONS - (17-04-2017)]

Nanda Samararatna
Rare personality
Nanda, the jewel of a paddy left the shores of Sri Lanka to breathe her last in the arms of her beloved daughter Lalani in California. Her unexpected demise on August 14, 1916, was a shock too sad and unbearable to all of us who knew her down First Lane, Dehiwala. She bade adieu to her family relations friends and neighbours, both here and California, putting everybody into deep grief. Her unending love for Sri Lanka and all of us probably caused her early departure.
Everybody has beautiful words of praise for this rare personality. She was calm, soft spoken, and well-mannered with immense friendly ties. It is with sadness and great respect that I recall the time, though not very long, I spent with her in conversation, not feeling the time passing.
Born to a respectable family at Kurunegala, she was very proud of their gloried past. Both her parents were principals of schools who rendered a great service in the field of education.
They always advocated a life of Buddhist principles, and it was well demonstrated in her active participation in religious activities. She had her early education in schools where her parents worked and her secondary at Holy Family Convent, Kurunegala, the most prestigious school there. After her school career, she became a qualified teacher of distinction, serving the country through the many schools she taught at, her last being St. Clares College, Colombo. Among her many talents, she excelled in cookery, art, and music.
She was blessed with a loving husband, Dr. Samararatna. He was a knowledgeable person who had read widely and was highly distinguished in his career as an Education officer. Both were devoted parents to their illustrious children, well brought up, daughter, Lalani and son, Alex, professionally highly qualified in their respective fields. They gave them the correct education and exposure needed. They had a rich family life and shared many good times with friends and relatives. Lalani, presently domiciled in California, took her there with overwhelming love, and we were all saddened by her untimely goodbye. Lalani's still grieving over the loss, and is said to continue a lot of religious performances to bestow merit on her.
Alex, at this end, performed the religious rights under the advice of Ven. Diviyagaha Yasassi Thera of Bauddhayathanaya, Watarappola, Mount Lavinia, where she had been a devoted Dayikawa. According to Nayaka Thera, the merit she had acquired in her life span was more than enough for her sansaric journey, while narrating the numerous meritorious activities that she was deeply involved in.
Under the guidance of the Thera she had vastly contributed to the rural Buddhist temples, assisted the student monks in their education, participated in annual cattle releasing campaigns of the temple, and above all, what she enjoyed most was the donation of a serene Buddha statue to a temple at Madurangala. With the passage of time, she seriously took to religious activities; she never failed to listen to Dhamma sermons daily at her residence and to observe ‘sil’ on Poya days, accompanied by her son. She also led a very good social life, helping the poor and the needy. Such was the life of this rare personality. Her memory will certainly live as one of those who led a very meaningful life. Her demise is mourned by all her relatives, friends, and those whom she helped with a noble heart. Her rich smell of humanity still exists. Let this be a tribute to her.
May she attain the Supreme Bliss of Nibbana.
Rupa Banduwardena
Ravindra Wimal Jayewardene
Modest hero
“A great son of an even greater father, is only manifested by the conduct of the great son that brings merit to his greater father”.
I stand here today in anguish to memoir the immortality of the late Ravi Jayewardene. His exemplary unpretentious lifestyle established ‘what peace there is in silence’ amid the noise and haste of ostentatious gloating. He went about placidly in modesty out of conviction and respect to others, which was his pivotal objective.
He navigated his own car on the roads himself, in humility, although he was one of the pioneering sons of the soil that was accredited by the International Regulatory Authorities to pilot passengers in the sky across the globe. He shunned security escorts and bodyguards, although he was assessed as a prime target of the bloodiest terrorist organization on the planet.
Unlike most, who demanded all the trappings of office, a man of his position held in regard to personal security, late Ravi Jayewardene demonstrated to all that he had the confidence and ability to look after himself.
Special Task Force (STF) remembers his colossal contribution to fostering the expertise he injected into the Armed Services and Police in the field of Combat Pistol Shooting having himself at one time been Western Australia’s Combat Pistol Champion.
A man, who lived a very simple life not basking in the reflected glory of his illustrious father, the President of our beloved motherland, but residing in the backwoods of Piliyandala in a home by the river with his adoring wife, Penny, his closest companion at all times. He dressed most simply, spoke softly, and little and certainly endeavoured to conceal his family name in case, even a hint of being the first Son is oriented by the mere mention of it. His life style to devour all this, at a time of such proximate presence and political respect and not authority being availed to him, deserves an iconic role model that must be always remembered, reminded, and followed by the generations to come. This will be the only way we can say ‘Thank you’ to a great son of a great father.
Life, dishes out to us a mixture of challenges, successes, and failures, losses and gains. It is a constant in life. Each day offers us daunting challenges, some foreseen and some, unexpected, some discouraging and some rewarding. The catch phrase, “Who dares wins”, the popular motto of British Special Air Services credited to the founder of the SAS Colonel David Stirling, and again we are also reminded of the quote from Shakespeare’s, “The better part of valor is discretion.”
We stand today to pay our solemn condolences to our hero, mentor, and Beloved Friend, the late Ravi Jayewardene, who entrenched into us that, “He who dares, Wins.” I beg to make an emphasis, make no mistake, the late Ravi Jayewardene, was the undisputed father of the Special Task Force (STF). He was the pioneering visionary, who used his prudent mind to foresee the need for a specialised unit within the Sri Lanka Police at that time and beyond, to engage in counter - terrorism and protective security operations and mitigate threats to national security that was non-existent in the minds of Counter Terrorism Specialists that have mushroomed locally and globally.
His contribution through his inherent ingenious proficiency in matters of Defence and National Security have eluded the attention of many. At a time, when terrorism had plagued the country and was steadily making critical inroads into the security of the state, it was none other than the late Ravi Jayewardene, who strived arduously and identify the importance of good intelligence and training and also the deployment of small combat groups in search of this elusive enemy. As he perceived the requisite of this identical need, the embryo of something between a conventional Army and the Police, a Para-Military Arm was certain. To create from nothing such an organisation with exceptional skills, commitment, dedication, courage, and professionalism, the mandatory requirement was excellence and the very best of training. He strived and oppugned himself to settle to choose the very best of veterans from the elitist British Special Air Services (SAS) which have always remained as the number one special forces unit in the world.
Over the decades, STF has grown in manpower, technology, and tactics from our humble beginnings, and STF owe a deep gratitude to this mighty man, who stood up for what he believed in and followed that dream with relentless passion. This dream has constantly ratified his vision to be an asset to our beloved motherland.
The late Ravi Jayewardene was, is, and will always remain the undisputed father of the Special Task Force (STF) that has grown in the ensuing decades and our excellence today as a professional and formidable force is a reflection of his untiring sacrifices and incredible exertions.
He spent extensive hours of training and superintending the progress of new recruits to the Special Task Force (STF), observed and personally guided them into the in-depths of combat operations and to inspire them he strived to secure the Special Task Force with the very best in men, technology, and equipment needed for combat enabling the Special Task Force to evolve to being the most dreaded force to the terrorists. His unrelated determination to his dogma “that the eastern province being the sole penetratable route into the terrorist strongholds and the deployment of the Special Task Force to achieve this objective bore results in the years to come.
Special Task Force soon became first the pride of the Police and later, the pride to the nation in combating not only terrorism but organized crime whilst being respected and admired by the populace of this Country.
Late Ravi Jayewardene set high standards and was a taskmaster. He set the tone for those he saw deemed fit to command the Special Task Force at its inception.
I am humbled with the honour of having being closely associated with the late Ravi Jayewardene, as a young sub-inspector culled to be recruited into the first intake of the pioneering batch of the Special Task Force, who were trained by the counter terrorism specialists formerly from the elite British Special Air Service (SAS). It was the vibrant yet humble ingenious of this great gentleman, which paved the way for the formation of the Special Task Force (STF).
Philosopher, Socrates remarked, “The secret of change is to focus your energy on building the new,” and this is exactly what the late Ravi Jayewardene achieved, for all of us in the Special Task Force (STF). For this revolutionary change, in his solemn absence, once again, I am obliged to repeat my expression of gratitude by saying “Thank you, our dearest sir”.
Excellence is not an act, but a habit - this is undoubtedly a manifestation in the manner in which late Ravi Jayewardene molded his thoughts into action and motivated others around him to attain a common objective in unison. Our excellence today as a professional and formidable force is a reflection of his untiring sacrifices and incredible exertions.
His unique contribution was not made in expectation of any recognition or reward. This is an endorsement to the exemplary work done voluntarily by the late Ravi Jayewardene, whereby he enriched none other but only the security of our nation.
He was altruistic, modest, and did not gloat that he built the Special Task Force (STF) virtually and realistically with his brain, bare hands, and vigour. The Special Task Force (STF) and the late Ravi Jayewardene will always remain synonymous. I must say, dearest sir, if you were here in body and soul, you would have discreetly stopped me from declaring these facts or shied away from here. Please pardon me, dearest sir, I have to say these, as you always taught us that “the truth is always stubborn.”
His vision continues to guide us as we streamline our stratagems and stay ahead of constantly evolving needs.
On behalf of all serving and retired Officers of all ranks, who are and were honoured to serve in the Special Task Force, we salute you, our dearest sir not for position, badges, or ranks, but for the legacy humbleness and simplicity you have left behind that, the least we can do for you is pass it down with your name carved on it as an icon. We salute you our dearest sir for the immense and significant role you played in the formation and development of the Special Task Force. Although your soul has left us, your memories and the yeoman services you rendered shall remain engraved with eternal gratitude in the hearts of all of us and those that come to be honoured to serve in the Special Task Force in the future.
As a mark of deep respect and honour for the manner in which this great son, great human being, and undisputed mentor that crafted the Special Task Force as it were, we humbly seek the permission of his beloved wife, Penny, and family, to display his portrait with pride prominently in the Special Task Force Headquarters in Colombo.
May your soul rest in eternal peace, our dearest sir, and may you attain Eternal Bliss.
In conclusion, I solemnly quote from the poem, “For the Fallen,” from Robert Laurence Binyon:
For all of us the in Special Task Force (STF), Ravi Jayawardena shall grow not old,
As we that are left grow old,
Age shall not weary him, nor do the years condemn.
At the going down of the sun, and in the morning,
We all shall always remember our hero, mentor, and beloved friend, Ravi Jayawardena.
M.R. Latiff, Senior Deputy Inspector General of Police, Commandant - Special Task Force
