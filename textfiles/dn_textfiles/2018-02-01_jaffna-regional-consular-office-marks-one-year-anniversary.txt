Jaffna Regional Consular Office marks one-year anniversary

The Foreign Affairs Ministry Jaffna Regional Consular Office marked it’s one-year anniversary on January 26. In keeping with the aim to improve and enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of consular-related service delivery to the general public, particularly those in the Northern Province, the Foreign Affairs Ministry opened a regional consular office in Jaffna on January 26, 2017. The regional consular office is located at the District Secretariat in Jaffna.
The regional office provides a range of consular services to the public that were previously only available through the Ministry of Foreign Affairs Consular Office in Colombo. These services range from attestation of birth, marriage, and death certificates, as well as educational certificates for their use abroad, extending assistance to family members of Sri Lankans who may be stranded abroad, facilitation of redress and compensation claims of families of migrant workers, and repatriation of human remains from abroad.
Prior to the opening of the regional office, a mobile consular service had been held in Nallur, Jaffna, from August 28 – 31, 2016, with staff of the Consular Division providing consular services with the Department of Immigration and Emigration and the participation of the Sri Lanka Foreign Employment Bureau.
To date, the consular Office in Jaffna has attested over 10,364 documents and served over 5,000 people who have been able to avail of consular services without travelling to Colombo. Through the Electronic Document Attestation System (e-DAS), the regional consular office is digitally linked with the Main Consular Affairs Division in Colombo and can process documents and applications in real time.
