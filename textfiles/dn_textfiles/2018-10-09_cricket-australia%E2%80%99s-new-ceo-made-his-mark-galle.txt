Cricket Australia’s new CEO made his mark at Galle

Cricket Australia’s newly appointed CEO Kevin Roberts visited Sri Lanka for the first time with his family recently and thereby hangs a tale.
Kevin and his family were walking along the road inside Galle Fort when a six landed close to them. Kevin picked up the ball and went and joined the lads in their game.
If only the lads knew they were playing with the new CEO of Cricket Australia!
“Another example of how cricket can bring communities together around the world,” was how Kevin described his experience.
