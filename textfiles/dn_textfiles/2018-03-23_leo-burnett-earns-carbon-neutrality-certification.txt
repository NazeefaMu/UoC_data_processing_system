Leo Burnett Sri Lanka was recently awarded the Carbon Neutrality Certificate after a thorough analysis of the manner in which the agency conducts its business operations keeping in mind the natural environment. This prestigious certification reflects the agency’s responsible approach to ensuring long term sustainability for itself and its stakeholders. The Certificate was handed over to Leo Burnett Sri Lanka CEO, Arosha Perera. The CarbonNeutral Protocol guarantees the integrity and credibility of clients’ carbon neutral certification and enables them to be certified CarbonNeutral.

By interweaving our sustainability goals with our financial and operational goals, we are creating win-win conditions for the agency to thrive into the long term. I believe this certification also drives greater self awareness amongst our staff when it comes to minimizing impact to environment or society at large, besides affirming that the agency has reduced its greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. We hope to build on this certification further by streamlining our systems and processes to eliminate waste and inefficiencies.”
The Carbon Consulting Company, CEO, Sanith de S.

We congratulate the entire LB team for their concentrated efforts.”
