Ministry to curtail unwarranted coconut tree-felling:
Individuals to require special permit from CDB

In a move to curtail the unnecessary felling of coconut trees in both the Kurunegala and Puttalam districts of the North Western Province (NWP), the Plantation Industries Ministry had made arrangements to introduce a new procedure in which anyone wishing to cut down coconut trees would be required to acquire a special permit from the Coconut Development Board (CDB).
A Cabinet paper for the purpose would be forwarded soon and the measures would be legalised thereafter.
“At present, permits have to be taken in order to cut down jak trees, from divisional secretaries countrywide. Likewise, those who wish to fell coconut trees too, have to obtain permits from the Coconut Development Board henceforth,” Kurunegala Senior Divisional Secretary W. E. Jayathilake told the Daily News yesterday in Kurunegala.
Private real estate companies fell coconut trees on a large scale these days in both the Kurunegala and Puttalam districts as they sell coconut lands through fragmentation and hence, this decision to issue permits to cut down coconut trees by the government, was taken to discourage such acts, he added.
Jayathilaka further said that such irresponsible felling of coconut trees had resulted in a 25-percent decline in the NWP’s coconut harvests during the past five years.
