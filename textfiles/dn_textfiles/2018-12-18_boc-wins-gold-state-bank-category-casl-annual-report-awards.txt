“Being a responsible services-provider for its customers, whose integrity has been tested over a span of 79 years, the Bank has evolved to deliver a service which goes beyond mere banking to its community. Bank of Ceylon makes an effort to communicate its financial and non financial information in a holistic manner to represent the true nature of the bank’s performance.With that BOC ensures that its annual report complies with the standards set by regulatory bodies and international reporting guidelines such as International Integrated Reporting (IIR) framework issued by the International Integrated Reporting Council and GRI standards guidelines issued by the Global Reporting Initiatives (GRI) for sustainability reporting” stated the CEO/ General Manager Senarath Bandara.Adherence to best financial disclosures as per Accounting standards and regulatory requirements, early adoption of GRI standards and integrating the report across all six capitals with maximum disclosures are the key characteristics of the Annual Report 2017.
Leading the Sri Lankan Banking industry with over 79 years experience, the Bank of Ceylon has become the most stable and the trusted bank in the country that serves Sri Lankans from all walks of life helping them to build their lives and making themselves financially stable whilst uplifting the country’s economy.
The Bank earned global recognition as one of the top 1000 banks in the world, as listed by “The Banker Magazine” (UK) and the “The Asian Banker” magazine named the bank of Ceylon as the Strongest Bank in the country for the year 2018. “BOC” was awarded the “Peoples Service Brand of the Year” at the SLIM - Nielsens Peoples Awards 2018, which reflects the brand strength among general public.
