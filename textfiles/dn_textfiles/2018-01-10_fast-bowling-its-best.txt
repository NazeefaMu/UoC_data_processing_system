Fast bowling  at its best

The two Test matches that ran concurrently with each other – the fifth Ashes Test between Australia and England at Sydney and the first Test between the top two ranked Test teams India and South Africa at Newlands, Cape Town produced some of the finest fast bowling in contemporary cricket. All these bowlers hit the 140k plus speed limits and made life extremely difficult for the batsmen unless of course the nature of the pitch slowed them down.
On a pitch that is renowned to help spin, Australian fast bowlers Mitchell Starc, Josh Hazlewood and Pat Cummins took 14 of the 20 wickets in the second innings to subject England to an innings and 123 runs defeat and to hand Australia a comprehensive 4-0 win of the series and with it the Ashes which they regained after two years.
Michael Clarke’s team had lost it to England in 2015 by a 3-2 margin, but Steve Smith led his team from the front to recapture the Ashes in the subsequent series making a personal contribution of 687 runs off his own bat (avg. 137.40) with a top score of 239 out of his three centuries. Smith was the biggest stumbling block for England as they strived to run through the Australian batting time and again thwarting their attempts with telling contributions with the bat that has taken his career average to 63.75 which is second only to the great Sir Donald Bradman’s 99.94.
Batting around Smith were the Marsh brothers Shaun and Mitchell whose contributions really pushed England to the point of no return. What a proud moment it would have been for their father Geoff Marsh, the former Australian opener and coach when both his sons made hundreds in the Sydney Test.
Geoff if one may recall was coach of the Sri Lankan team in 2012 but his two-year contract with Sri Lanka Cricket was shockingly terminated after just four months that led to Geoff taking legal action against SLC who had to pay him a substantial amount. It was during Geoff’s short tenure that Sri Lanka secured their maiden Test victory in South Africa at Durban.
If Smith was the key to Australia’s success with the bat, then the bowling honours was shared by the three seamers Starc, Hazlewood and Cummins and off-spinner Nathan Lyon each of them finishing the series with over 20 wickets apiece. Those figures proved that Australia did not rely on just one or two bowlers for their success but the wickets were distributed equally amongst the quartet of bowlers that Smith had at his disposal. It is rarely that one finds four bowlers taking over 20 wickets in a series which proves how much the bowlers understood each other’s roles.
How much did England miss the all-round contributions of their vice-captain Ben Stokes is a matter of conjecture. Would the result of the series been different had Stokes played? England were left to ponder on these questions after leaving the all-rounder out on disciplinary grounds where he is facing a police inquiry into an alleged brawl outside a Bristol pub.
On the other side of the continent another battle between fast bowlers and batsmen took place at Newlands where South Africa emerged winners by 72 runs against a fighting Indian outfit whose strong batting line-up failed to cope with the brilliant bowling of Vernon Philander who moved the ball both ways to cause considerable damage to their innings on both occasions.
A target of 208 on a pitch offering plenty for the fast bowlers was always going to be challenging and testing and the Indian batsmen proved they were not upto the mark to counter the South African pace attack which was without an injured Dale Steyn in the second innings.
India’s batsmen had proved vulnerable to the moving ball during the first Test against Sri Lanka at Eden Gardens Kolkata last November when Suranga Lakmal along with Lahiru Gamage and Dasun Shanaka had bundled them out for 172 on a green pitch under overcast conditions.
Here, against a quality fast bowling attack that had Philander, Rabada, Steyn and Morne Morkel, India’s batting was found to be wanting. Although the sun shone the pitch had a lot to offer the bowlers after being under covers the entire third day due to rain.
In Steyn’s absence Philander took on the responsibility and stood up to bowl his country to a creditable win with a career best performance of 6 for 42 on a fourth day pitch that saw 18 wickets fall for 195 runs in 64 overs. In actual fact it was a three-day Test as the third day was washed out without a ball bowled.
It was a Test match dominated by the fast bowlers with the South African pace quartet picking up all 20 Indian wickets and likewise India’s quartet of fast-medium bowlers Mohammad Shami, Bhuvneshwar Kumar, Jasprit Bumrah and Hardik Pandya capturing 17 wickets. The spinners hardly had any say in the Test with Ravichandran Ashwin bowling just 8.1 overs in the entire match and South African left-arm spinner Keshav Maharaj ten.
India had their moments in the Test when they reduced South Africa to 12-3 in the first innings and 130 all out in the second after being 66-2. However it was their batting overall that let them down.
If not for Pandya’s counter-attacking knock of 93 off 95 balls that lifted India from a despairing 92-7 to 209 in the first innings, South Africa would have simply run away with the Test. In the second innings no one really stood up for India and the target of 208 seemed a distance dream.
However the three-Test series is poised for an interesting contest with India, the no. 1 ranked Test side expected to bounce back in the next two Tests scheduled to be played at the Centurion and Johannesburg.
