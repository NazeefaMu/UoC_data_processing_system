Lotteries Board ticks Bandula:CFIB takes fake tickets claim to court

The Colombo Fraud Investigations Bureau (CFIB) yesterday filed a B report in Colombo Fort Magistrate’s Court against Colombo District MP Bandula Gunawardena.
This is for allegedly claiming that there are fake lottery tickets in circulation being sold by agents of the National Lotteries Board.
Gunawardena had publicly announced during a recent press conference that fake lottery tickets are being sold by National Lotteries Board (NLB) agents.
Filing a facts report before the Fort Magistrate Lanka Jayaratne, the CFIB informed that they commenced an investigation into the matter persuant to a complaint lodged by NLB.
The Fort Magistrate ordered the CFIB to conduct further investigations into the incident and submit a report in court on the next magisterial inquiry date.
The Magistrate issued an order directing several television channels that unedited video footage pertaining to the concerned press conference be handed over to the CFIB in order to conduct further investigations.
