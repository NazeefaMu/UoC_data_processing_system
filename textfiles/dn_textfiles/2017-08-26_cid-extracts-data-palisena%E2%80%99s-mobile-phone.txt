CID extracts data from Palisena’s mobile phone

PTL CEO hands over his laptop to CID:
Deputy Solicitor General Milinda Gunatilake yesterday averred that several important telephone call recordings relating to certain deals entered between the Perpetual Treasuries Limited and the Employee’s Provident Fund are missing.
DSG Gunatilake said call recordings under serial number 6816, 6817, 6818 and 6819 are not found in the call recordings provided by the PTL to the PCoI.
The Perpetual Treasuries Limited handed over all the telephone call recordings of its company to the Presidential Commission of Inquiry investigating into the Treasury bond issue prior to last week. All the telephone calls are recorded under consecutive running serial numbers.
Playing three call recordings in relation to a secondary market transaction which took place on June 5,2015, between the PTL and the EPF, DSG Gunatilake questioned PTL CEO as to why the investigators cannot find telephone call recordings relating to the conclusion of the deal.
Palisena agreed that in all three telephone calls played, the dealers from both sides do not come to any conclusion regarding the discussed transaction. He further said that he will have to check with his IT experts as to why call recordings under the said serial numbers are missing.
DSG Gunatilake questioned Palisena if the PTL has tampered with the call recordings, which Palisena denied.
Meanwhile, Kasun Palisena yesterday handed over his laptop device to the CID team attached to the PCoI for a digital forensic examination. President’s Counsel Kalinga Indatissa informed the PCoI that the CID will be extracting data from Palisena’s mobile phone which was handed over to the PCoI in the beginning of August 2017. The data extraction was to take place yesterday at 2.30 p.m. in the presence of Palisena’s legal representative. Indatissa further said that CID will extract data from Arjun Mahendran’s mobile phone on next Wednesday (30).
The Attorney General yesterday began cross examining PTL CEO Kasun Palisena, following evidence being led by PTL’s counsels through Palisena.
The PCoI informed that it will sit from 10 a.m. to 4.00 p.m. starting from next Monday, as it is pressed for time.
