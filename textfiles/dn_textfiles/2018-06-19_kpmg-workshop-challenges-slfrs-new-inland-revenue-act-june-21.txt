KPMG workshop on Challenges from SLFRS on new Inland Revenue Act on June 21

KPMG will conduct a workshop enlightening the challenges emerging from SLFRS on the new Inland Revenue Act on June 21 at the Movenpick Hotel Colombo from 9 am to 12.15 pm.
The tax law is intertwined with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) to such a degree under the new Inland Revenue Act (IRA), in order to grasp concepts of taxation, it’s influence stemming from GAAP must be comprehended.
It’s a fair statement to make that the tax implications stemming from the new Inland Revenue Act are much more closely interwoven with Sri Lanka Financial Reporting Standards (SLFRS) compared to the previous income tax regime.
One may observe concepts and definitions in the new IRA influenced by IMF Model Act are based on international practices, hence much aligned with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS).
Simple example would be the definition of Finance Lease contained in the new IRA. The phrase bears a strong resemblance to the definition in the SLFRS 16. On the other hand there are instances where the concepts / definitions in the new IRA which deviate from that of the Accounting Standards too which gives rise to complications in computing the income tax liability.
A topic that attracted much debate in the current context is the classification of assets for the purpose of new IRA.
The Act restricts the definition of Capital Assets used in business & Investment Assets to specific categories identified in the Act whilst defining Depreciable Assets and Trading Stock too whilst defining Assets in an inclusive manner very widely. On the other hand Sri Lanka Accounting Standard - LKAS 16 refers to Property, Plant, Equipment and Investment Properties dealt in LKAS 40. Deferred Tax addressed in LKAS 12 derive impact from classification of assets.
The presentations will be conducted by Suresh R.I. Perera and Shameel Nayeem.
In this very current and pertinent subject matter the speakers will educate the audience on Capital Assets, Investment Assets and Deferred Tax thereon, besides the Tax treatment on gains or losses recognized in the Other Comprehensive Income Statement (OCI). Moreover, they will be explaining the intricacies in Leases, Foreign Currency Transactions and Financial Instruments.
The tax complexities embedded in the new Inland Revenue Act has been enhanced due to the impact from the SLFRS, and there is a great nexus between calculation of income tax liability and the Accounting Standards compared to previous income tax regimes. Shameel Nayeem, Partner, KPMG is an Associate Member of the Institute of Chartered Accountants of Sri Lanka, an Associate Member of the Association of Certified Chartered Accountants and an Associate Member of the Institute of Certified Management Accountants of Sri Lanka.
