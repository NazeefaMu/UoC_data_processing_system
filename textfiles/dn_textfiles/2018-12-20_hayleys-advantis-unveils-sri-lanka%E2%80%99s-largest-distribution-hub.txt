Hayleys Advantis Unveils Sri Lanka’s Largest Distribution Hub

Hayleys Advantis Limited unveiled Sri Lanka’s largest distribution hub – Advantis 3PL Plus Logistics City – in Kotugoda, Ja-ela recently.
This is part of the company’s strategic capacity building and expansion efforts aimed at serving its clients better through greater efficiencies and economies of scale. The move bodes well for the nation’s vision of establishing Sri Lanka as a key logistics hub in the South Asian region.
With the first phase of development now complete, this new facility adds 335,000 sq. ft. of space with 38,000 pallet positions and a holding capacity of up to 55,000 cubic metres (CBM) to the company’s warehousing footprint. The soon to commence second phase of development at the site will see this expand to approximately 500,000 sq. ft.
Mohan Pandithage, Chairman and Chief Executive of Hayleys PLC said, “Hayleys, with its 140 year history, has always been a proud contributor to Sri Lanka’s economic growth. Our newly unveiled 3PL Logistics City will help the nation move yet another step closer towards realizing its goal of emerging as a key logistics hub in the South Asian region.”
The facility is designed to cater to diverse industry verticals and serve as a distribution hub capable of meeting the fast-changing needs of brands and retailers across the globe. It will be equipped with best-in-class technologies and product management systems with a focus on automation and digitization.
“It is with great pride that we unveil the Advantis 3PL Plus Logistics City to our prestigious clients, many of whom have stood by us as true sources of encouragement in our journey for well over a decade,” said Ruwan Waidyaratne, Managing Director, Hayleys Advantis Limited. “Advantis has taken many bold steps in the recent past with the aim of uplifting Sri Lanka’s logistics industry in preparation for Asia’s trade and commerce boom. This new facility will allow us to consolidate most of our operations at a single location and deliver greater operational efficiencies and cost benefits to our clients.”
