The advent of one-day cricket

J.M. Kilburn in his book ‘Overthrows’ states he was not a committed advocate of one day cricket for first class cricketers.He believed that this popular fancy of the present time to be a contradiction of purpose and inevitably self defeating in its object of attracting spectators to cricket. First class cricketers in his belief needed more than fifty or sixty overs or an hour or two in which to express themselves.
Cricketers of first-class quality needed more scope than the one-day match can offer them. Without scope they couldn’t develop their potential or having developed, they cannot maintain the standards of which they are capable. Cricketers who have attained first class level by playing in first class cricket - which is, of course the only way to become first class - will be the most successful one day players; but should the one day form become dominant the first class player will not be developed and county cricket will not rise above club standards, noted Kilburn.
When one day cricket for the counties were first proposed he was lukewarm towards it, fearful of long term consequences of tradition. He saw in the Gillette Cup competition an attractive and useful variation in the summer program, to be ranked in status with the festivals or the old Gentleman v Players fixtures he welcomed it as a parallel to the seven-a-side tournaments in Rugby Union football.
With the institution of the Gillette Cup he hoped for modifications in the county championship program, but he believed then as he believed now, that three day cricket should preserve itself essentially through intrinsic attractions; that it should be first-class not only in name but in presentation.
Kilburn found the one- day form of cricket as offered by first class cricketers unsatisfying mainly because of the inevitable artificial limitations imposed. One day cricket was the appropriate cricket for most of them because it was the cricket of their capabilities and opportunity.Their technique and their temperament would not sustain long innings or long bowling spells. Blessed with advanced skills and discipline they should move into a wider range and given the opportunity they invariably do. The illogicality is moving back again. First class cricket is an extension and development by the gifted few of afternoon cricket attempted and enjoyed by the many, but the quality of the few had to be diminished or disguised in afternoon compression. One-day cricket cannot be a distillation of first class essence it must either be a restriction or a parody. The greater and more complicated the artificialities the more blatant the parody, added Kilburn.
In apparent paradox one-day cricket has provided fewer days to remember than single days of truly first class cricket. Few great innings had been played or could have been played simply because circumstances do not permit them. Even in the occasional big score sustained mastery is not required because the bowling challenge automatically diminishes. It is cricket nonsense to suppose that five bowlers will all be equally testing on one afternoon. It is a cricket contradiction of common sense that bowling authority establish or close upon establishment should have to be relinquished because of over limitation, stressed Kilburn.
The longer one day matches - or more strictly single innings matches - do of course provide occasional hours of rare splendor, occasional achievements to catch the breath in anxiety and admiration. Lancashire contrived such an hour in their famous victory over Gloucestershire at Old Trafford, and Yorkshire made magic in the Gillette Cup Final with Surrey in 1965.
Kilburn vividly recollects that on both those occasions the special quality of the day was influenced by the climatic conditions. Lancashire won when by normal assessment of light they could not see to win. Yorkshire won when all the probabilities were against any play at all.
Yorkshire travelled to London for their final in pouring Friday rain. Harder and harder the evening rain teemed down and arrival at Kings Cross found London awash.
Kilburn went on to add that Saturday brought fair weather and the start of the match was put back no more than an hour and a half.
