Keith Noyahr abduction and assault case: (Retd.) Maj. Gen. Karunasekara further remanded

The Former Military Intelligence Director and Chief of Staff of the Army, Major General (Retired) Amal Karunasekara was ordered to be further remanded until May 2 by the Mount Lavinia Magistrate’s Courts yesterday.
Karunasekara was produced before Mount Lavinia Additional Magistrate Lochana Abeywickrama yesterday.
He was arrested earlier this month by the CID in connection with the alleged abduction and assault of journalist Keith Noyahr in 2008.
The Attorney representing Karunasekara, Nalinda Indatissa had made a request for bail.
Counsel Lakmini Kirihagama appearing for the Attorney General’s Department told Court that the former Editor of the Nation Newspaper for which Noyhr had worked, Lalith Allahakoon and the former Chairman Krishantha Cooray had spoken to then President Mahinda Rajapaksa and then Defence Secretary Gotabhaya Rajapaksa and asked that Keith Noyhr be released, otherwise this issue would be taken to the international forums. She said that Noyhr was released thereafter.
According to Police, Major General Karunasekara who was also the Commandant at Defence Services Command and Staff College, was arrested on charges of aiding and abetting the Keith Noyahr abduction.
