Saaraketha awarded  Gold at NCE Export Awards

 
Sri Lanka’s retailer and exporter of fresh, certified organic food, Saaraketha Holdings was awarded gold under the ‘Other Agricultural Products’ sub-sector at the NCE Awards 2016.
Organized by the National Chamber of Exporters of Sri Lanka, the awards ceremony was held recently, at Colombo Hilton under the patronage of Deputy Minister of State Enterprises and Entrepreneurship Eran Wickramaratne.
The award was received by founder and Managing Director of the company Prasanna Hettiarachchi.
Saaraketha Holdings was founded in 2008 with the aim of supplying ethically produced, fresh and affordable food to all. As an island blessed in abundance with fruits, vegetables and spices, Sri Lanka has ample resources in terms of produce as well as a highly-skilled farming community who for centuries have nourished the nation but sadly gone unnoticed.
The underlying aim of Saaraketha is also to uplift the lives of the farming community in the country by educating and engaging them in a lucrative trade.
Saaraketha is a one-stop certified-organic shop for all your food needs. Certified organic by the Control Union in Netherlands, their extensive product portfolio of more than 200 products.
Taking the convenience factor globally, Saaraketha also ships their produce around the world. For those who wish to literally ‘pick’ their own produce, Saaraketha’s own flagship store is located at Ward Place, Colombo 7.
Believing in making organic a natural way of life again, it is Saaraketha’s multi-faceted efforts that were recognized at the NCE Awards 2016. Selected by an eminent panel of judges, the award recognizes the efforts made by a company to positively impact the nation’s export sector.
