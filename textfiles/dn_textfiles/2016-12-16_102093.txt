SL vulnerable to sustained capital outflows - Moody’s

Sri Lanka, Malaysia, Hong Kong, Singapore and Taiwan rank top in terms of vulnerability to the effects of sustained capital outflows, Moody’s Investors Service warned yesterday.
In its latest report, it noted the marked drop in financial asset prices in the region since the US presidential elections in November which led to currencies in the Asia Pacific region to depreciate against the dollar together with falling equity prices and reversal in portfolio flows.
However Hong Kong, Singapore and Taiwan however have fiscal space to buffer negative shocks, it noted.
Moody’s Investors Service says that financial asset prices in Asia Pacific (APAC) have fallen markedly since the US (AAA stable) presidential election in November 2016, with APAC currencies depreciating against the US dollar, equity prices falling and portfolio flows reversing. High levels of debt and links to global financial markets are sources of vulnerability for some Asia-Pacific sovereigns, said the report. “Overall, vulnerability to the direct and indirect effects of sustained capital outflows is highest for Mongolia, Sri Lanka, Malaysia (A3 stable),Hong Kong (Aa1 negative), Singapore (Aaa stable) and Taiwan (Aa3 stable), although the latter three have fiscal space to buffer negative shocks,” the report said.
The few countries in the region that currently face external liquidity challenges include Mongolia (Caa1 stable) and Pakistan (B3 stable) and, to a lesser extent, the Maldives (B2 stable), Papua New Guinea (B2 stable) and Sri Lanka (B1 negative).
If they last more than a few weeks, capital outflows or lower inflows will correspond to a tightening in domestic financing conditions for many Asian countries and, for some, could exacerbate difficulties in meeting their current account and external debt payment obligations.
Moody’s points out that with a few exceptions, direct vulnerability to capital outflows is limited in APAC.
