EPIGENETIC EVOLUTION OF THE DRY ZONE TAMILS

It has now been universally accepted that all living things have to adapt to their environment to survive, or perish. The Tamils living in the inhospitable Dry Zone had to adapt to survive in it, unlike the lucky Sinhalese who live in the lush fertile Wet Zone.
The Tamils underwent a minor evolution called an Epigenetic Evolution, which involves a minor chemical change in the chromosomes, which had an effect in the bearers’ ability to adapt to the Dry Zone, as a survival technique.
The Dry Zone could not sustain the Tamils and the British did not have the technological ability to develop it in the early sixteenth century, when they made the island into a unitary state for the convenience of administration as they did in Africa and the other parts of their Empire.
English education
The Tamils were, therefore, forced to seek employment in the Wet Zone where the Sinhala majority lived. They were forced to acquire an English education in order to survive. The Sinhalese did not have such a worrying problem, in fact they refused to learn English until Colonel Henry Steele Olcott, who was an ardent Buddhist, encouraged the Sangha to open schools for the Sinhala Buddhist children. Besides the Sinhalese did not have the same survival motivation the Tamils had, who had to choose between education and starvation. So, throughout the years the Tamils became a more successful minority with a certain amount of job-denial for the Sinhalese. This naturally caused resentment and anger towards the Tamils.
This imbalance in education and employment had to be urgently redressed in order to avoid a serious destabilization in the country. SWRD Bandaranaike who wanted to be the Prime Minister at any cost, promised the Sinhala people that he would ban Tamil and English and have “Sinhala Only” if he was voted in as the next Prime Minister. The Sinhala naturally voted him in.
The Sangha and the Sinhala leadership lacked the wisdom to think forward and anticipate the natural repercussions of such a drastic move against the Tamil minority. It was like a declaration of war against the minorities. It was this that caused the immediate division of our country - “by a mere stroke of the pen” - as they say.
Ethnic war
The Epigenetic Evolution imbued the Tamils with better qualities for survival. It made them hardy and resilient, endowed them with a better work ethic. It made them docile and calm and put them off criminal activity.
The crime rate in the Dry Zone was almost negligible. The murder rate in the Wet Zone at one stage was within the first ten in the world because the Sinhalese are a very emotional and fiery people, although one of the kindest Buddhists when not roused!
The Epigenetic Evolution made the Tamils more successful which also led to their downfall and the 29-years-old ethnic war. The Tamils who were forced to emigrate, are continuing to live successful lives, especially in Canada and Australia.
The Sinhalese blame the “divide and rule” policy that contributed to the Epigenetic Evolution and Tamil success, which may be partly true, but it is the “Environment Factor” and the Epigentic evolution.
