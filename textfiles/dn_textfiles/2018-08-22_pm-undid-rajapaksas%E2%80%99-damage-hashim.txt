Selling of lands to foreign nationals
PM undid Rajapaksas’ damage: Hashim

Former President Mahinda Rajapaksa sold important lands in high security zones to foreign nationals, Highways and Road Development Minister Kabir Hashim said. He was addressing a gathering at a ceremony to provide 1,560 land deeds in Kegalle.
However, the country was fortunate as those deeds were converted into leases by Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe, the minister highlighted.
