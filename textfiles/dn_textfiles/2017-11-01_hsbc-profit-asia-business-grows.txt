HSBC profit up as Asia business grows

Banking giant HSBC has reported pre-tax quarterly profits of $4.6bn (£3.5bn) for the three months to the end of September.
The result marks a huge 448% increase from $843m posted in the same period a year ago. At that time, earnings were hit by a one-off loss of $1.7bn from the sale of its Brazilian unit. The latest result met market expectations and was helped by cost-cutting and a focus on Asia. "Our pivot to Asia is driving higher returns and lending growth, particularly in Hong Kong and the Pearl River Delta," HSBC's chief executive, Stuart Gulliver, said in a statement. The firm's earnings were further boosted by higher premiums from its insurance and asset management businesses in Asia.
HSBC's shares were down more than 1% in late morning trading in London following the earnings update.
