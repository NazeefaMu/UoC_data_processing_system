Urani pink lagoon: Teeming with life

Arugam Bay is the amalgamation of the Tamil word for six - Aru and the Sinhala word for village - gam and over an adventurous few days Juliet Coombe discovered the area has a lot more to offer than surf, sand and sea, when staying at Jetwing Surf.
Now one of the world’s top surfing destinations, a place that has around 330 days of sunshine annually, and is ideal for beginners and masters, Arugam Bay could once only be reached by truly adventurous travellers of the 1970s, called wave chasers, who lived out of their cars or in thatched village beach-huts.
From April through October, the swell can get as big as eight feet and competition fierce so watch the masters at work with a fiery red sunset lighting up this surfing paradise. Now with more than thirty five excellent places to eat and world class premium brand Jetwing Surf for top end luxury one can now also enjoy fine dining experience at its finest under the stars, and top spot with architecturally award-winning cabanas to experience not only the waves, but also the amazing historic sites in the area, superb wildlife reserve and superb ancient lagoon complexes.
Urani pink lagoon is at its best at sunrise with its own little wildlife museum ‘Eco Lagoon Safari Information Centre’ and fishing community, a highlight of my trip to Arugam Bay. Here the Urani fishing communities are passionate about their stunning mangroves, range of birds and so along with the recreational officer of Jetwing Surf, Hiran who always carries the superb bird watching guide by Gehan De Silva to spot the twenty plus species of lagoon birds. We set off pre-dawn when the lagoon was like a pink flamingo and the water was wonderful hues of pink. Every safari on this ancient tributary is different and for those who get up at 5am you will be rewarded by anything from the local farmers chasing the water buffaloes across the lagoon in a small blue canoe boat with the oars swinging through the air to get them rounded up and over to the paddy fields on the other side. The oar swinging in circles is to scare the sleepier animals into action, and it is as if they are cattle ranching at the O.K. Corral with cries of ‘Ye Hi’.
One of the best sightings on a Urani Lagoon safari is seeing the wild elephants bathing early morning, head bumping each other and throwing water in the air while they drink and play wash each other and then paddle doggy style to the other side. On my first day we saw them miles away in the distance after landing close to a paddy field where we could see due to the huge holes in the mangroves several elephants had crossed earlier in the morning. Getting out we sank into a muddy elephant footprint and after a lot of stumbling about, loosing flip-flops and nearly the camera, as we laughed at our muddy disposition. I took pictures of the two male elephants vanishing into the undergrowth. With Opticon binoculars always at hand I could see one very well on the horizon and trudged ever closer in my bare feet to take pictures, while still staying at a safe distance.

The next day we returned to the same point thirty minutes earlier and were stunned to see them eye balling us on our tiny boat, through the elephant made holes in the mangroves. We took pictures as they ambled over curious no doubt by a person with long lenses looking just like a trunk zooming in and out to get the best angle. As eagles circled overhead, I learn from the boatman they have no less than five types in the area and combine this with enjoying the largest land animal romping around it was already an unforgettable adventure.
The recreational manager of Jetwing Surf Hiran quietly pointed out 20 different species of birds and explained they have an astounding 22 different types of mangroves in Urani Lagoon. Just as the biggest of the five elephants was about to put his foot in the water, two boat guys passed by shouting to each other, hearing all the noise the elephants got frightened and went into the bushes fearing attack on the youngest member of the small herd. How something so big can vanish like magic into a tiny area is beyond me, and yet they did and so we went around to the other side, where water lilies are in abundance to see if we could track their giant footprints. Sure enough there they were in-printed deep into the lagoon mud like big foot striding across the landscape and yet despite being wide-open planes they had given us the slip.
With so much to see I was not disappointed as we quietly rowed on along the lagoon to an area where a flock of Bramaney Kites circled and found look out points in the branches of the tall trees. From here we saw several mugger crocodiles with snout noses, which grow to up to 4.5 meters and cunningly disguise themselves in the roots of the mangroves. Going out early is essential to see the lagoon action whether it is fisherman throwing nets or the crocodiles catching their first prey of the day. The birds dart in and out of the waters catching jumping fish until the tropical sun starts to kick in giving great air displays with their incredible wing spans. I have a go at paddling as we vanish into a warren of mangrove plants and see some of the smaller more colourful birds like the king fisher splash colours of blue across the small lagoon flowers.
Our boat trip ended around 8am in the morning with the now scorching sunlight light catching on the roots of the mango trees by Urani Bridge, where we landed the pontoon rowing boat and enjoyed a cool drink at the very informative wildlife museum. It was nice to know the names of all the different mangroves we had seen are called, and talk about the week’s sightings with the fisherman before heading back to Jetwing Surf. On arrival I received a cool towel and then enjoyed an epic breakfast watching the waves pumping into action and a swim afterwards in the award winning hotel grounds overlooking the Indian Ocean.
