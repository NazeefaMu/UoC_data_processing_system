Big Bash finish

The heat is on and we brace ourselves for what promises to be two huge impact semis ...Kandy vs CR & FC ....at Pallekelle and very much a huge day trip up for sure, and Havelocks vs Navy at Racecourse.
Kandy away from their safe cauldron...might show signs of rare weakness, and hand CR, a neat set of calculated opportunities that CR will look to exploit boiler beyond conventional limitations...at every given turn.
Their victory against fellow CH warriors couldn’t have been better timed and points on the board ...CH visibly stunned by the wave of tries which was well engineered by Omalka and the boiler house boys. It was a solid team performance by the Reds, up and down the park. Winning the upfront battle was the clincher, and opened the Maitland boys on all fronts.
CH whose defence has been their Achilles heel, were short of drift and tackles ...which gave CR plenty of good ball to run .....and run they did to clock up a well worked 49 points at full time.
CH rising up to claw back that lead to 49-29 ...led by Muthu, Yoshita, Sathya...couldn’t get their Maitland marauding machine to outwit the hungrier CR unit.
The casualty figures were higher and difficult to fathom at times ...but Ratwatte made sure all possession was maxed ...and running ball the simple plan last Saturday. CH had only themselves to chat options ...as we all know, catch up and knockout rugby are tough bedfellows.
Kandy stepped and brushed Air Force aside with customary ease to line up their semifinal clash and some casual thoughts on how they plan to grind CR down.
Havelocks will have many thoughts about options to exploit Navy and dominate them upfront in the sets and sharper, stronger to outmuscle Navy and win the breakdowns....this will be the critical factor and both sets of forwards ...itching to stamp their class and pile on the pressure.
On paper ...It looks like a Kandy v Havies final....but Clifford Cup knockouts are never about form...it’s about heart and ability to push past confrontation ...its patience power and wit ..to outthink ...and petrol to finish ...and a heap of skills that beggar description ...it’s about big finals and the instincts that separate mere players from incredible talent ...its Pandoras box and Lady Clifford’s singular vision for rugby history.
Beyond the Clifford Cup finals unfolds Sri Lanka rugby’s busiest and most comprehensive season ever ...from club to national and then to international on the rugby planet.
We start in March with our wild card to the World Series Hong Kong 7s, return home to grab new kit, and our date with destiny at the Commonwealth Games in Australia, where Sri Lanka meets Fiji and current Olympic champions in our group opener ....our greatest litmus test for 7s so far .....The season is too complex to imagine and the boys will certainly need extra to handle the pressure.
The Singer school season raises itself and much anticipation for family friend’s and rugby old boys who finance the team investment beyond our normal horizons ...naturally dominated by the bigger stables and proud history from March to August.
Singer Sri Lanka the proud partners to the country’s elite rugby league tournament and all the young branded warriors from each corner of our sports mad island nation.The NatWest 6 Nations ..kicks off another spectacular weekend..Fri 23 February...France v Italy..Marseille 1.30am Saturday Sri time.
24 February...Ireland v Wales Dublin 7.45pm, 24 February...,Scotland v England Edinburgh 10.15pm ‘Calcutta Cup’, 25 February....Clifford Cup finals Longdon Place 4pm.
That’s the tantalising list this February jolly ...prepare, plan, absorb the pressure and mind up for the impact....Adrenaline faithful be wary of getting the times well cleared ...There is little allocation for those who hesitate.
Celebration on either side of our rugby universe is reason for all islanders to elevate their minds and arm the hamstrings...
Cheers folks...
Bula Bula the hearts that live our time in the middle..!
