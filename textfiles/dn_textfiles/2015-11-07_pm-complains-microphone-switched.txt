PM complains microphone switched off

 
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe yesterday asked the Secretary General of Parliament to investigate why his microphone was switched off when he was speaking in Parliament.
The Prime Minister complained to the Chair that Parliament officials did not give him the microphone when he was replying to a question by UPFA MP Dullas Alahapperuma.
He requested the Chair to look into the complaint and report to him as to why he did not get the microphone.
The Prime Minister's microphone had been switched off several times while he was responding to a question by Alahapperuma on the construction of the Central Highway. Therefore, the Prime Minister's reply could not be heard properly.
Prime Minister Wickremesinghe brought this to the notice of the Chair and asked the Secretary General to submit a report on the incident.
