Measures to protect historic Payagala Caves from landslides

 
Multidisciplinary evaluation report has been sought on the historical Pahiyangala cave to decide on steps needed to protect it from landslide threat, Education Minister Akila Viraj Kariyawasam said.
The minister made this observation in reply to a question by JVP MP Dr Nalinda Jayatissa in Parliament today. The MP asked what immediate measures the Ministry has taken to conserve the site in the face of recent landslide threat.
Kariyawasam, observing that the Ministry’s special attention has been drawn to this matter, said that he inspected the site along with the Heads of Archaeological Department and Central Cultural Fund.
He said the Buddhist monks in the site have been asked to evacuate, adding that arrangements would be made to provide them with alternative place to stay.
He said once the report is submitted, the ministry would decide the future measures, adding that foreign expertise would be sought if necessary.
