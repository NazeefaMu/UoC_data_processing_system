Showers expected from tomorrow

The showery condition will enhance from tomorrow especially in the southern half of the island, the Meteorology Department said.
The Met Department went on to say that several spells of showers will occur in the Eastern and Uva provinces and in the Hambantota district.
Showers or thundershowers will occur at a few places in the Western, Sabaragamuwa and Central provinces and in the Galle and Matara districts.
Misty conditions can be expected at some places in the Western, Sabaragamuwa, Central and Southern provinces during the morning. There may be temporary localised strong winds during thundershowers.
