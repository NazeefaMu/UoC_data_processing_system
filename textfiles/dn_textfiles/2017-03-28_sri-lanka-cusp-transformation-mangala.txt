Sri Lanka on the cusp of transformation: Mangala

Sri Lanka is at an exciting time of transformation and transition. The country is seeking to reconcile and prosper, Foreign Affairs Minister Mangala Samaraweera said.
Minister Samaraweera was speaking at the 60th anniversary celebration of the establishment of diplomatic relations between Sri Lanka and the Russian Federation recently.
The minister said the country is on a new path towards good governance, reconciliation and development.
He stressed the importance of transmuting peace dividends into tangible economic and social progress for all Sri Lankans.
“We recall with great appreciation the development assistance that contributed in no small measure to support Sri Lanka’s economic and social development,” he said.
The minister said the former Soviet Union remained a principal bilateral development partner in the 1960s. “The technical assistance provided built the foundation of Sri Lanka’s manufacturing sector,” the minister said.
Minister Samaraweera said Sri Lanka is proud of the Russian literary giants, philosophers, political thinkers, scholars, artists, explorers and musicians, who have richly contributed to global culture and education.
“Sri Lanka’s own literary and political traditions have been enriched by Russian literature and political movements. We continue to celebrate Chekov’s plays, and commemorate his visit to our country in 1890,” he said.
Sri Lanka continues to commemorate the October Revolution, he said.
“Russia’s generous gift to Sri Lanka has been the educational opportunities provided for thousands of Sri Lankan students for nearly three decades since the 1960s. In the early days, Sri Lankan students were awarded annual scholarships to pursue medicine, engineering and other technical fields at the Peoples Friendship University. Many of the beneficiaries of these scholarships contributed to Sri Lanka’s overall development,” he said.
