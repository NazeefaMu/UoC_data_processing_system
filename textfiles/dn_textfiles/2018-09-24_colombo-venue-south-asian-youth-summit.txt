Colombo venue for South Asian Youth Summit

The 2nd South Asian Youth Summit will be held from November 28 to 30 in Colombo under the theme ‘Creating a Sustainable Future in a Fractured South Asia’.
India-based youth organisation International Youth Committee (IYC) will host the summit.
The summit will act as a platform to increase the areas of cooperation among SAARC youth for better ties and economic prosperity amongst member nations, the organisers said in a news release.
It will also create an inclusive platform for youth that enables them to review the progress of the SDGs, share ideas, experiences and innovative approaches for effectively contributing to the SDG framework and its implementation.
An expected outcome of the summit includes adoption of the first South Asian Women’s Commission dedicated to reducing crimes against women and children, among other issues. All SAARC nations are expected to participate in the summit.
Various technical sessions and discussions will take place at three venues in Colombo during the three-day summit.
