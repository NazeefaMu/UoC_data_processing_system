Kandy schools rugby round-up

This time around, we have as many as four schools still very much in the hunt to win the Singer Schools Rugby Cup championship. This is a rarity. From a rugby standpoint, this is huge, as it shows just how much the game (at least at school level) has improved. In the years gone by, it used to be very much a two-horse race at best. This alone makes for some intriguing viewing over the next couple of weeks.
Trinity and St. Anthony’s are close to the Cup and the Plate trophy. Trinity defeated Isipathana after 2012 in their inter school cup competition match. With this win Trinity are close to repeating their feat of 1987 when they last won the league title. The cup will be in their hands if they beat Royal at Saturday’s game. In the history of the league Trinity has won it three times - first in the second year of the tournament in 1974 under C.Y. Ching Snr. Then in 1977 under R. Balasuriya and the last was in 1987 under T.Rajapakse. Now they head into their deciding game of this year's Cup Championship knowing they need just a win to secure the title.
Last week Dharmarajah College also won when they beat Science College in a Plate game. St. Anthony’s College who beat Prince of Wales in their last outing are also close to the Plate title. Kingswood College beat Lumbini College comfortably, so this time these three Kandy schools Dharmaraja, St Anthony’s and Kingswood are sure to be climb up to division I. Vidyartha College with a young side is having a lean season, in their last outing they went down to D.S. Senanayake College. Sri Rahula College playing the division II cup was beaten by Vidyaloka Vidyala Galle; St. Sylvester’s College playing in the Bowl beat Richmond College, Sri Sumangala failed to play their Shield game due to Wesak.
Trinity cleared a tough hurdle last week at Pallekele when they registered a glorious 15 points to 10 victory over Isipathana. They went into the match knowing that a win was all they needed to get closer to clinching the title. Trinitians and the Pathanians started the Saturday’s matches on equal term. It was the host who led the standings on better score difference at half time. Both teams cheered the large fans, by putting up a superb display of rugby. Trinity scoring five tries three conversions and three penalties against the Pathanians two tries. Avesha Priumakara and Reshan Bandaranayake was the toast for Trinitians with a try each, while Leshan Wijesuriya the play maker fired the kicks at goal. For the losers Haritha Bandara and Chamod Fernando chipped in with one try each.
Dharmaraja completed a smashing 25-17 victory over Science College in a Plate competition encounter, which was worked off at Nittawella grounds. The Rajans who have been doing well in the second round got into business from the kick off and virtually dominated the forwards and back division play. But more importantly they were quite outstanding in the loose play and combined well in the rucks and mauls. The Rajans had more terrestrial advantage and this made them score the points. The outstanding feature of the game was splendid touch finding of the Rajans, most of the kicks put in the shade the efforts of the Science team backs in the trails that followed this game. Rajans however failed to pocket the bonus points. Their next game is on Saturday at Ratmalana with Prince of Wales.
Kingswood scored a massive 60 points to 8 victory over Lumbini College in a Plate trophy encounter played in Colombo. Kingswood controlled the game throughout their hard working forwards to have had enough ball from the loose play and really rattled the opposition. Their backs too did what was needed and warmed up for the next showdown against D.S. Senanayake College on Monday at Navy grounds Welisara.
St. Anthony’s in the Plate competition made the highest score of the season against Prince of Wales as they ran up seventeen tries, out of which ten were goalled. It was an impressive victory. Antonians went about their task in the most spectacular manner while running down the tries. They completely dominated the game with forwards and three quarters combining beautifully. Their halves combination clicked well with their backs controlling the game beautifully, but more importantly the forwards had a superb game. The Antonians need to beat Science College in their next outing on Sunday to lift the Plate championship and they should have no problem doing it.
Viidyartha from whom much was expected failed to do their best. They started with a bang and failed to live up to the end. They have a young set of players, who are sure to play for another three seasons, win or lose they give their maximum. D.S. Senanayake College gave a good display to beat Vidyartha. The next game for Vidyartha is on May 21 against Lumbini in Colombo.
Sri Rahula’s Division II Cup competition game against Vidiyaloka College did not come off. They were due to host Bandaranayake MV Gampaha at the Peradeniya Campus grounds yesterday.
St. Sylvester’s playing in the Bow went down to Thurstan College and in their last game played on Monday beat Richmond College. Their next game is against Mahanama College.
Sri Sumangala’s Shield competition match against Athulathamudali MV was not played due to any ground being available. They are hoping to play on May 24 at Peradeniya Campus grounds. Tomorrow they will play Eheliyagoda Central at Peradeniya Campus grounds commencing at 2 pm, as they have to hand over the grounds by 4 pm for the University sports activities.
