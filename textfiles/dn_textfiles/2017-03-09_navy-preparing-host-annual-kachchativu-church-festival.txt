Navy preparing to host annual Kachchativu Church Festival

As tensions grow over the death of an Indian fishermen in Sri Lankan waters, the Sri Lankan Navy is preparing to host its annual Kachchativu Church Festival this year and Deputy Foreign Minister Harsha de Silva asked that the recent incident not cloud the festival which brings together fishermen from across the Palk Strait under a common faith. Over 1,500 Indian fishermen in 150 boats are expected to arrive for the Festival which is to take place over the weekend.
The Festival which hosts both Indian and Sri Lankan fishermen has been held for many years on the island of Kachchativu and since the end of the war, the church feast has been arranged by the Sri Lankan Navy.
“The biggest issue between India and Sri Lanka is the fishermen issue, apart from that we share warm relations”,de Silva said.
The Deputy Minister was speaking at a media briefing yesterday on the tensions caused between the two countries as a result of the death of the Indian fishermen. The Indians charge that the fisherman was shot by the Navy while the Navy has denied such allegations.
Indian fishermen encroaching into Sri Lankan waters is an issue both countries have been grappling with and according to the Deputy Foreign Minister, over 100 boats and 146 Indian fishermen are languishing in Lankan jails for having illegally crossed the country’s maritime boundaries, while four Sri Lankan fishermen remain in Indian custody. “We are investigating into this incident in depth and we say to India, this matter should be resolved. In January, we had fisher talks but they were not fruitful and we expect to have another round of talks in April. We hope for better results there,” Deputy Minister De Silva added.
