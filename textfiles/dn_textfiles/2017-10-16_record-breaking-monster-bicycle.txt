Record breaking monster bicycle

Bike builders are constantly competing to make the lightest bicycle possible, but not Jeff Peeters. The Belgian engineer set the Guinness World Record for heaviest rideable bicycle in the world: 1,895 pounds and 15.6 ounces.
Peeters rode his giant contraption down the street in Mechelen, Belgium, to demonstrate that it could be done. To officially break the record, he had to ride the bike a minimum distance of 100 meters, or 328 feet, which he did with no problem. Other than not being able to turn, riding the bike on a flat surface seems fairly easy.
To build his gargantuan bike, which measures 7.4 feet tall and 16.5 feet long, Peeters used large tractor wheels and recycled scrap metal for the frame. It appears that two positive gear ratios are used to pedal the behemoth and actually spin the massive wheels. A small chain ring on the crank connects to a large cog in the rear like a normal bike. But that large cog connects by way of a bottom bracket to another small cog on the opposite side of the frame, which is connected to the rear wheel with a second bike chain. The result is a super-easy gear ratio, letting you pedal the 1,900-pound bike. It's basically the same setup as a tandem bicycle, but way more awesome. Popular Mechanics
