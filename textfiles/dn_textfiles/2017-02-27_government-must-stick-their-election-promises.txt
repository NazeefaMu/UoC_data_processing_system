Government must stick to their election promises

Election promises must be kept by the government if they wish to safeguard the validity of the current political system, Health Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne said.
According to the minister, the common declaration with President Maithripala Sirisena was signed to form the Government two years ago at the Viharamahadevi Park in Colombo and he had to come back to the same place after two years to hear the grievances of the staff in the education sector.
The minister was addressing the gathering after attending politically victimised employees' meeting in the education sector.
Minister Senaratne said relief should be given for those subjected to political victimisation since 1994.
The Government had prepared a list of 10,000 employees and 4,000 were selected to offer relief.
But it was questionable whether the relief was offered properly.
It is the Government responsibility to offer relief to all politically victimised public servants equally. Otherwise, they would be disappointed. It was they who brought this Government into power. But their problems have not been solved.
Arrangements will be made to solve the issues after having discussion with the Cabinet.
