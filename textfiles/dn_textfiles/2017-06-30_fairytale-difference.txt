A Fairytale with a Difference

 June, 19th,2010. Inside the Stockholm Cathedral, 1,200 royal guests and dignitaries watch the fairytale wedding, albeit a slight twist, along with 500,000 people who lined the streets, and an estimated 500 million TV viewers from around the world. Yet the princess only has eyes for her groom, a former fitness instructor from a village in the forests of central Sweden, as she calmly speaks her vows, tenderly wipes a tear from his eyes after exchanging rings, and at one point, even winks at him during the service.
The whole event had a tinge of fairy magic in it, except that this time it was a beautiful princess who whisked her prince away from humdrum ordinary life to a magical world of palaces and balls. In his extraordinary courtship with Crown Princess Victoria, the ‘villager’ whose mother worked as a clerk at the post office and whose father was a manager at a municipal social services center had received the modern equivalent of the kiss that turns the frog into a prince - careful grooming by courtiers, language tutors and a public relations agency. Eight years after he met her, he was transformed into a sophisticated, modern young royal ready to marry the Princess who will one day wear the crown.
Princess Victoria first met Daniel Westling during a session in his Stockholm gym. She was a troubled princess at the time recovering from the breakup of a long relationship and training at the gym to fill her empty hours, as well as to help overcome a serious eating disorder. (making this the best met-on-the-treadmill love story ever heard.) He was first pictured in Swedish newspapers in 2002 looking startled at the attention of paparazzi, wearing jeans, with his long hair poking out from under a baseball cap. Even worse was his rural accent, the subject of cruel jokes among Victoria’s blue blood friends. Adding fuel to the fire, her father, the authoritarian King Carl XVI Gustav, 64, was dead set against their relationship. His precious daughter was lined up for a Danish prince with impeccable lineage and the king was determined not to admit a tongue-tied commoner from the forests into the royal fold. The pressure was so great that in 2004 their relationship entered a crisis that nearly ended it. But Victoria stuck to the path of true love. Daniel learned enough etiquette to get by in high society, with the assistance of a committee of courtiers who were dubbed “prince’s school”. After the courtiers taught him how to eat, what to say, how to stand, he had evolved into the perfect prince. “Now with the suit and tie and designer glasses he looks like a stockbroker,” said Sten Hedman, an author who has followed the Royals closely since 1962. “The transformation is remarkable – he is barely recognizable from the young man we saw in 2002.
On the day of the wedding, the radiant and beaming 32-year old bride walked down the aisle on the arm of her father, the king, in a cream-colored duchess satin gown with short sleeves and an off-the -shoulder, rounded neckline. Designed by Pär Engsheden, the dress had a V-shaped back and a 16.5-foot train fastened from the waist. Topping off the look, as everyone predicted, was the Cameo tiara which the bride’s mother, Queen Silvia, also wore to her own wedding on the same day in 1976. Made of gold, pearls, and cameos, the tiara’s center cameo depicts Cupid and Psyche from Greek mythology. Cameo drop earrings and a cameo and pearl bracelet completed the look.
The bridesmaids, two of whom are Victoria’s royal god-daughters, wore pearl-white, silk organza dresses with roll collars and ballet slippers. Princess Catharina-Amalia of the Netherlands and Princess Ingrid-Alexandra of Norway - both six years old, and future queens themselves - held hands as they walked down the procession. The page boys, which included four-year-old Prince Christian of Denmark, wore sailor suits - a Bernadotte royal family tradition.
When the clock struck midnight in the gilded ballroom of Stockholm’s Royal Palace on June 19th, Prince Daniel led his princess in the first waltz of the evening, as an audience of Europe’s royalty looked on approvingly.
To quote Hedman, “It was like a fairytale - she kissed her gym trainer and she got a prince.” - Aditha
