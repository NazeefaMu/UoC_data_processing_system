Escape of notorious drug-trafficker in transit:
Eight Kegalle prison officers interdicted

Nine officers of the Kegalle Prison have been interdicted over the escape of a drug-trafficker in remand custody.
Prison media spokesman, SP Thushara Upuldeniya said a drug trafficker named Sunil Shantha had managed to escape from custody near the Welikada Prison.
A jailor, a sergeant and six prison guards of the Kegalle Prison have been interdicted.
They are alleged to have aided and abetted unidentified persons dressed in khaki uniforms who arrived to ‘kidnap’ Sunil Shantha, an inmate of the Kegalle Prison who was a heroin trafficker, following several cases.
He was in the Kegalle Prison and was brought to the Welikada Prison to be produced at the Kalutara High Court for a drug-trafficking case on November 7, by the alleged prison officials. They had not followed due procedure in handing over the prisoner to the Kalutara Prison officials.
It is alleged that two persons posing as prison guards of the Kalutara Prison had met the interdicted guards near the Colombo Prison and took Sunil Shantha away. Investigations also reveal that they may have been bribed.
