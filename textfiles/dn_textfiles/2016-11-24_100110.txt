SLCA to use Rs. 4m revenue from Australia to assist past cricketers

 
The Sri Lanka Cricketers’ Association (SLCA) is to receive revenue of Rs. 4 Million from the two matches played by the 1996 Sri Lanka World Cup winning team in Melbourne and Sydney which they hope to utilize to help past cricketers who are in need of financial assistance.
The event organized by Asanka Gurusinha now domiciled in Australia and a member of the World Cup winning squad also included dinner dances which helped them collect a handsome sum.
ACM Lafir, former Sri Lanka opener of the pre-Test era and a committee member of SLCA said two of the past cricketers the association had in mind of helping immediately are former wicket-keeper batsman Russell Hamer who is sick and ailing and former Sri Lanka captain Anura Tennekoon who has requested for financial assistance.
“The money we are receiving from Australia will be utilized strictly to help old cricketers who are in dire financial straits,” said Lafir.
He revealed that seven past cricketers received a monthly allowance of Rs. 10,000 for several years until the finance company they had invested the money crashed and since then the association has stopped the payments.
“We are trying to bring a resolution at the AGM on December 8 to revive it,” said Lafir.
The SLCA is headed by former Sri Lanka Test fast bowler Graeme Labrooy and includes past cricketers like Roshan Mahanama, Pramodya Wickremasinghe and Ken de Alwis.
