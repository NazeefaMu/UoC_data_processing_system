SLC terminates hospitality partner for breaking law

Sri Lanka Cricket states in a media release that following a decision made by the Executive Committee in February, 2018, SLC appointed Classic Destinations Private Limited as the hospitality partner for the Nidahas trophy and the England tour of Sri Lanka.
Accordingly, the company was entitled to, at its sole cost and expenses to provide and or supply Hospitality Services (including food and related care) to the spectators procured by the company for such Corporate Boxes with no involvement of Sri Lanka Cricket.
In that context, in the exercise of the rights granted to the company, it shall be duty bound to act within the laws of the country by procuring and obtaining relevant licenses and or permits as required by law for the services to be offered by the company to its spectators.
As the firm has failed to act within the law; as found following a raid by the Department of Exercise during the 5th ODI between Sri Lanka and England at the RPICS; and bringing disrepute to Sri Lanka Cricket, SLC has decided to immediately terminate Classic Destination from delivering further hospitality services during the England tour.
Sri Lanka Cricket will handle the corporate boxes in the upcoming matches to ensure that spectators will not face any inconvenience.
