Boozing students get court warning

Eleven students who skipped school and consumed alcohol were taken into custody by the National Child Protection Authority in Kilinochchi yesterday (19).
The students belong to a school in Shantipuram in Kilinochchi.
The officers of the Child Protection Authority moved to arrest the students after they were tipped off of students engaging in anti-social behaviour.
The students were produced before the Kilinochchi district court. Acting District Judge S. Subramaniam ordered the students’ parents to appear before court.Parents of eight students appeared before court where the Judge after strictly admonishing the responsible parties handed over the students to their parents.
The students whose parents did not appear before court were ordered to be kept under Child Protection Authority custody.
