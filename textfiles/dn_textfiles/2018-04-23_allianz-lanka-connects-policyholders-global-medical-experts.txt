Allianz Lanka connects Policyholders with global medical experts

Allianz Insurance Lanka and Allianz Life Insurance Lanka (Allianz Lanka) rolled out second medical opinion service to all its policyholders across both the life and general insurance categories in partnership with Assist America, one of the world’s largest providers of global emergency medical services.
Assist America works with specialists in all fields of medicine in major medical centers throughout the USA. Should a complex or critical medical condition arise, Allianz Lanka policyholders will now have access to the best possible medical expertise in the world, without the need to travel anywhere. They can simply request for Medical Opinion online by connecting to the portal from anywhere, at any time.
Specialized professionals from top medical institutions in the world will be on hand to confirm a diagnosis, provide advice and recommendations on the treatment available including the very latest state-of-the-art, alternative treatment options and follow-up analysis on chronic health conditions.
“At Allianz, we are committed to standing by our policyholders during their hour of need. In line with this, we would like to dedicate the Second Medical Opinion Service to all our policyholders,” said Ruchera Perera, Senior Manager - Life, Allianz Life Insurance Lanka. “When faced with critical illnesses or requiring a surgery, getting an additional, alternate medical opinion is always reassuring and offers greater peace of mind. Taking this into account, we have partnered with Assist America to provide our policyholders with access to some of the world’s leading medical practitioners from the comfort of their homes.”
Allianz policyholders can rely on this service to get the opinion of specialists on the specific medical condition or illness and the treatment options available; both standard procedures as well as new cutting edge protocols.
A written opinion on the case will be provided to the policyholder within a stipulated time after receipt of all required information.
Allianz Insurance Lanka Ltd. and Allianz Life Insurance Lanka Ltd., known together as Allianz Lanka, are fully-owned subsidiaries of Allianz SE, Germany, a world leader in integrated financial services. In a bid to further strengthen its local General Insurance operations, Allianz had acquired a 100% stake in Janashakthi General Insurance Limited, earlier this year.
