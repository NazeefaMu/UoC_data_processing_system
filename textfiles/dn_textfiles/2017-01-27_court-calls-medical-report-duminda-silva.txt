Colombo Additional Magistrate Aruni Artigala yesterday ordered the Superintendent of Welikada Prison that a medical report pertaining to the health condition of former MP Duminda Silva be obtained from a neurologist attached to the Colombo National Hospital.
The former Parliamentarian was not brought before Court yesterday by prison authorities over three corruption cases filed by the Bribery Commission.
At a previous occasion, Prison officials informed Court that Silva was not healthy to be brought before open Court even by a wheelchair.
Accordingly, further magisterial inquiry was fixed for February 13.
Submitting a report pertaining to the health condition of Silva, the Chief Medical Officer of Prison Hospital informed Court that Neurosurgeon of Mount Elisabeth Hospital in Singapore had highly recommended that Silva should be kept in an absolutely hygienic environment, kept in a magnet less field and stress less condition.
On January 5, Silva was brought to the Colombo Chief Magistrate’s Court premises in an ambulance by prison authorities.
The Bribery Commission alleged that the former Parliamentarian had failed to declare his assets and liabilities in accordance with the Declaration of Assets and Liabilities Law No.1 of 1975, for a period of three years since 2011 to 2013.
Silva was sentenced to death by the Colombo High Court for committing the murder of four people including former MP Bharatha Premachandra and he is serving a sentence of imprisonment at the Welikada Prison.
On September 8, 2016, former Defence Ministry Monitoring MP Duminda Silva was sentenced to death by the Colombo High Court for committing the murder of four persons including Premachandra on October 8, 2011.
At a previous occasion, the defence counsel appearing for the former MP informed Colombo Additional Magistrate Aruni Artigala that his client was willing to plead guilty if the court would impose only a fine.
The Bribery Commission officials told Court that according to Assets and Liabilities Law, the Court has jurisdiction to impose a fine of Rs. 1,000 with one year jail term for a person who found guilty to the charges.
Subsequently, the defence counsel informed Court that his client was not pleading guilty to the charges and moved for a trial.
Assistant Legal Director of Bribery Commission Thushari Dayaratne appeared on behalf of the prosecution. Defence counsel Anuja Premaratne appeared for the accused.
