Forty five percent of country’s expenditure for road development

Forty-five percent from the capital expenditure of the country consists of expenditure incurred to develop the road system, Megapolis and Western Development Minister Patali Champika Ranawaka said.
Speaking at a media briefing on the review of the pilot project to dedicate priority lanes for buses at the Megapolis and Western Development Ministry, he said: “according to the pilot project, 22 percent of bus passengers, 43 percent of private vehicles and 37 percent of three-wheelers are in favour with extending the bus lane.”
Priority lanes were dedicated to buses under the one-week pilot project from Rajagiriya to Ayurveda junction aimed at finding a solution to the traffic congestion in Colombo and to uplift the standards of public transportation.
The Megapolis and Western Development Ministry implemented the project jointly with the Road Development Authority, Sri Lanka Transport Board, Sri Lanka Police, Moratuwa University, Western Province Road Passenger Transport Authority and Colombo Municipal Council.
The pilot project review disclosed that the average speed of all vehicles at peak time (7.30 a.m. – 8.30 a.m.) had marked above 20 kmph. It is internationally accepted as a favourable condition to a country with traffic congestion issues, he added.
The minister said: “the priority bus lane system will be implemented during the next three months in identified areas. An efficient passenger bus transportation system will also be implemented within a period of one year. Also, a suggestion will be made to the Cabinet to allocate funds to uplift the public transportation system.”
He said priority bus lanes would be implemented to reduce the negative impacts caused to pedestrians and three-wheelers.
Minister Ranawaka said the implementation of an efficient urban development plan and uplifting standards of the public transportation system should be given priority over the construction of highways.
The main focus is reducing issues related to traffic congestion by means of increasing road discipline, he added.
Transportation hubs in Battaramulla and Colombo and sub-transportation centres in Panadura, Moratuwa, Piliyandala, Kottawa, and Kadawatha will be implemented. Makumbura Kottawa transportation centre will be opened within this year. The private sector will be encouraged to invest in these projects, the minister said.
He said a light weight railway system would be implemented from Battaramulla to Fort with financial aid from the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA).
Megapolis and Western Development State Minister Lasantha Alagiyawanna and Road Development Authority Transportation Specialist Prof. Samantha Widanapathirana also participated.
