Euro 52.1 mn from Netherlands for rural bridges

The Netherlands’ Rabobank has agreed to provide Euro 52.1 million financial assistance to construct approximately 250 steel bridges islandwide, especially in rural areas.
Finance Secretary S.R. Attygalle signed this credit facility agreement recently at the Ministry.
The government has accorded high priority for improving connectivity with a view to providing the full benefits of mainstream development activities in the country to remote villages.
The government plans to construct 4,000 bridges in rural areas to establish connectivity for transportation.
A large number of remote villages will be connected with transport facilities through this project which will in turn facilitate easy access to market, education and healthcare facilities for villagers.
This project will be implemented by the Provincial Councils, Local Government and Sports Ministry.
