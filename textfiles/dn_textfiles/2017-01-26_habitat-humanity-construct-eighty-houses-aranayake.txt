Habitat for Humanity to construct eighty houses in Aranayake

Habitat for Humanity Sri Lanka (HFHSL) has partnered with Alwaleed Philanthropies in an initiative to rebuild the lives of families affected by landslides in May 2016.
Together with the Government of Sri Lanka, District Secretariat of Kegalle and Divisional Secretaries of Aranayake, Yatiyantota and Deraniyagala, 80 families were identified as key beneficiaries for the rebuilding initiative.
Alwaleed Philanthropies has come forward to support Habitat for Humanity Sri Lanka's initiative by providing funding to construct 80 houses for victims of the landslides. Alwaleed Philanthropies has supported Habitat for Humanity's work over the past years including the earthquakes in Ecuador, Japan and Nepal and a cyclone in Vanuatu.
A Memorandum of Understanding between HFHSL and the Government of Sri Lanka's agents in Aranayake and Yatiyantota was signed on December 19, 2016 at the Kegalle District Secretariat. Through the Kegalle Housing Project, Habitat for Humanity Sri Lanka has pledged to construct 40 houses for the victims of landslides in Kalugala, Aranayake, 23 houses in Illukthenna Estate, Deraniyagala followed by the construction of 17 houses in Yatiyantota. The new houses will be stronger and better prepared for future disasters.
The ground breaking ceremony which launched the Kegalle Housing Project took place on January 16 in Kalugala Village in Aranayake.
Commenting at the ground breaking ceremony, Madurasinghe continued to say, “Parallel to this project we are looking to launch many key Habitat volunteer build initiatives in 2017, such as, Habitat Young Leaders Build, which will consist of a Scouts Build and a Women's Build in the upcoming months. It is our hope that these initiatives will not only contribute towards rebuilding lives and empower communities, but also contribute towards fostering the spirit of volunteerism among the youth in Sri Lanka.”
