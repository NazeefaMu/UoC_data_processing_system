'For the past 10 years, nearly 1,853 new leprosy patients identified in 2016'

Around 2,000 new leprosy patients are being reported every year for the past 10 years. A total of 1,853 Leprosy patients have been identified for the year 2106. Patients are reported from 26 districts in the country, said Acting Director General of Health Services Dr. Jayasundara Bandara.
According to Dr. Bandara, nearly 43 percent of the patients were reported from the the Western Province which amounts to 779 patients. The highest number of cases in 2106 which was 279, were from the Colombo district. Sri Lanka compared to other South East Asian countries, has a high percentage (9 to 10 percent of patients) with visible deformities at the time of diagnosis.
The percentage of children less than 15 years was nearly 9 to 10 percent, indicating active transmission of the disease from undiagnosed Leprosy patients. Child cases were high in districts such as Colombo, Gampaha and Galle, he said.
Nearly 50 percent of the patients were diagnosed more than six months after appearance of symptoms indicating lack of awareness among the public. Therefore awareness raising was very important, especially for school teachers, he added.
