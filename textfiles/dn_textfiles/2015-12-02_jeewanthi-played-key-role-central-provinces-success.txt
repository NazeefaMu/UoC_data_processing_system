Jeewanthi played key role in Central Province's success

When Central Province Ladies team won the women's hockey title at this year's National Sports Festival organised by the Ministry of Sports there was one player who player a silent but major role in them winning the championship for the 25th time, it was their goal keeper amiable Jeewanthi Keerthiratne. She did not allow a single goal to go past her while her forwards contributed 31 goals.
Twenty seven year old Jeewanthi Keerthiratne is at present Sri Lanka's number one goal keeper and the closest challengers to her are two school girls Bhaygya Kidituwakku of Sangamittha Balike Vidyalaya, Matale and Sakuntala Illeperuma of Seetha Devi Girls College. But Jeewanthi is still streets ahead of them and has been Sri Lanka's number one for the last seven years.
What makes her tick? Speaking to this writer in a very friendly manner she said that goal keeper's duty is to stop the ball sounding the boards. No acrobatic stunts or showmanship is necessary. You have a good look for the ball from the time it is little outside the semi circle and be in readiness to stop it.
Have your eyes on the striker whose reflexes will give an indication where she is aiming and stop it. You will have to move in the direction of the ball and position yourself and this will confuse the striker looking for an option and a little delay will allow the defenders to crowd round her and making things a little more difficult for her.
Manning the fortress is no easy task and the hard work done by the forwards will be in vain if you concede goals very specially in a closely contested match.
This was evidenced in this year's inter district finals between Kandy and Matale when the former was leading 1-0 for most part of the game. In the second half Jeewanthi did not allows anything to go past her and Kandy scored two goals to win the match 2-1, Many do not analyze this. To save a shot from close range could be very difficult and often dangerous but you should know how to handle it. It is here Jeewanthi is shoulders above the rest.
Jeewanthi Keerthiratne is from the village of Kiribathkumbura off Peradeniya where the only thing of some interest is the Highway Museum where on display is the old equipment from the old vintage used for the construction of Colombo - Kandy Highway under the guidance of Captain Dawson. There is also the specimen of the Bogoda Wooden bridge.
When asked why are goal keeper's stockily built she smiled and replied "I don't about others but my family is on the brawny side.
When I was around 10 years my school Seetha Devi Girls College was just making its presence felt in the schools hockey scene breaking the domination by two other schools in Kandy. My guru M. A. M. Ashroff spotted me and wanted me to come fro practices.
He said that I should, keep goal though at first wanted to be in the thick of play. I played for the school in all age group levels including a three year stint in the under 19 team before saying good bye to school life in 2007.
I played for the Sri Lanka Schools and was vice captain of the side which won the Singapore sixes in 2007. She also played for the Central Province schools team for three years.
In 2007 she joined the Sri Lanka Navy and played for the Defences Services which team she captained in 2013. She led Navy to win the Seetha Devi Sevens in 2011. She also led Navy to win the defence Services Title.
Some of her achievements in the international scene.
Was a member of the Sri Lanka womens team which won the Singapore Sixes in 2012 and 2013 and runners up in 2010. In 2013 when Sri Lanka finished runner up in the Asian Games qualifier held in Thailand which brought her a Silver medal.
Jeewanthi Keerthiratne says she is presently a member of the Sri Lanka Navy team which won the women's hockey nationals and the Seetha Devi Sevens this year and feels that she has few more years of hockey left in her. She is very agile between the posts and her physical movement supported by stick work is a treat to watch.
It is only the connoisseur of hockey who watch and digest her skills. To be Sri Lanka's number one for 8 years is great achievement.
