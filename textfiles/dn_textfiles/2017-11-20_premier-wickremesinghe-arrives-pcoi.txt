Premier Wickremesinghe arrives before PCoI

 
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe arrived before the Presidential Commission of Inquiry (PCoI) into the Central Bank Bond issue a short while ago.
Last month, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said that he was prepared to appear before the PCoI for any clarification that needed to be made as required by the Commission.
Accordingly, he was requested by the Commission to make a statement today.
