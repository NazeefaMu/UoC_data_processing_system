Single Employment Law to be introduced

The Labour and Trade Union Relations Ministry plans to introduce a ‘Single Employment Law’ instead of Acts and Ordinances, which are presently put in practise, Labour and Trade Union Relations Minister Ravindra Samaraweera said.
“Under this plan, a new Employment Law will be implemented instead of several laws and ordinances, such as, the Wages Board Ordinance, Shop and Office Employees Act, Maternity Benefit Ordinance, Factories Ordinance and so on. A Cabinet paper will be submitted in this regard,” he said.
When the Minister was asked whether the benefits and privileges utilised or enjoyed by employees by now will be curtailed by the new Single Employees Act, he said that the benefits enjoyed at present will not be reduced or curtailed with the implementation of new Act.
“In order to address the condition of work, the new Employment Law will be introduced by the amalgamation of several laws such as the Shop and Office Employees Act, Wages Board Ordinance, Maternity Benefit Ordinance and Womens, Young Persons and Children Act. In the future there will be a single law to protect the working community. It is significant that a non-discriminatory provision will be included to the law. As a result of the non-discriminatory provision there won’t be any discrimination such as gender, caste or religion in the future,” the Minister said.
He further said they plan to introduce some flexible working arrangements without sacrificing the rights of the working class.
The Minister further added that there will be provisions in future to look into domestic workers, which are not covered by any law by now. At present, there is no provision of any law that covers domestic workers such as house maids.
