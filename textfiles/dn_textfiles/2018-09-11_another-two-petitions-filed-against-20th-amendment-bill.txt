Another two petitions filed against 20th Amendment Bill

Another two Special Determination Petitions challenging the Bill entitled the “Twentieth Amendment to the Constitution” were yesterday filed before the Supreme Court by the Ravana Balaya Organisation seeking a declaration that the Bill shall become law only through a two-thirds majority in Parliament and the approval of the people at a referendum.
Two Buddhist monks attached to the Ravana Balaya Organisation including its General Secretary Ven. Iththekande Saddhatissa Thera filed these petitions naming the Attorney General as respondents.
The petitioners stated that the Bill entitled Twentieth Amendment to the Constitution was presented to Parliament by the Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) and placed on the Order Paper of Parliament on September 5, 2018.
The Petitioners state that several clauses of the said Bill, are in violation of and inconsistent with several Articles of the Constitution.
