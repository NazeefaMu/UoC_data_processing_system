Residents impede garbage dumping

The members of 60 resettled families at Ruwandeniya in Aranayake, prevented Pradeshiya Sabha workers who had arrived to dump garbage near their houses by blocking the road leading to the dumping site.
Residents said that swarms of flies had gathered in the area recently, soon after the garbage dumping had commenced.
The Ma Oya and Kuda Oya Conservation Organisation said that dumping garbage in the area would pollute the Ma Oya.
