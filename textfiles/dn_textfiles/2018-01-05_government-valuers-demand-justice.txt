Government Valuers demand justice

The Government Valuers’Association yesterday urged the government to implement the Treasury proposals to restructure the Valuation Department.
Government Valuers’Association President Nilantha Ekanayake called on the government to streamline and update its functions to increase efficiency for the betterment of the country. Addressing a media briefing held in Colombo yesterday,he said these proposals were sent on December 12, 2014 by the Treasury, but they have not been implemented so far.
"Cabinet approval has already been obtained and senior officials can do the needful.But, this has not still happened due to the close connection between private valuers and the certain senior officers. Their plan is to give the valuation role to the private sector and render the Department useless.However, if there is no proper solution for our demand, we will continue our trade union action further,” he added.
Government Valuers’ Association’s General Secretary D.M.Seneviratne said the protest is continued for a 44th day demanding the government to implement the restructuring process. Government valuers should be increased to 500 from the sixty valuers working at present, he said.
