Ex-soldier nabbed for drug-trafficking

Panadura Police Division Law Enforcement Unit officials arrested a disabled ex-soldier engaged in heroin-trafficking while riding a motor cycle along the Horana - Dawatagahawatte Road in the Horana Police area.
Police searched his artificial leg and found 24 packets of heroin. When the police team gave the signal to the disabled motorcyclist to stop his motorcycle, he did not obey and proceeded to evade them. The Police team then, had chased and arrested the suspect. He was produced before the Horana Magistrate on Thursday and was remanded pending investigations.
