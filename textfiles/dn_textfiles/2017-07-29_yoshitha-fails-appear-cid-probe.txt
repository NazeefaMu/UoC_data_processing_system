Yoshitha fails to appear in CID probe

The Criminal Investigation Department (CID) postponed the investigation of former President Mahinda Rajapaksa’s son Yoshitha Rajapaksa as he had not appear before the CID as scheduled yesterday.
He was ordered to appear before the CID to be questioned on the use of the Defender jeep for the “Siriliya Saviya” project which was implemented by the former first lady Shiranthi Rajapaksa and for other tasks.
She was also ordered to appear before the CID on an earlier day for questioning although she had requested to postpone it to another day.
The rescheduled day for the questioning of Yoshitha Rajapaksa will be announced by the CID within the next few days.
Financial Crimes Investigation Division (FCID) also carried out an investigation in connection with this Defender and she had to give a statement to the FCID regarding it.
FCID had completed the investigation and the investigation report will be forwarded to the Attorney General.
