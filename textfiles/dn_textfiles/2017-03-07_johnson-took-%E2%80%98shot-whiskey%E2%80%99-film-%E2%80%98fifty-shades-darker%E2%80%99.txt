Johnson took a ‘shot of whiskey’ to film ‘Fifty Shades Darker’

Alcohol makes everything easier. At least for Dakota Johnson, who admitted in a new interview that shots of whiskey helped her while filming steamy sex scenes with Jamie Dornan for ‘Fifty Shades Darker.’While chatting with Entertainment Tonight about the ‘Fifty Shades of Grey’ sequel, Johnson confessed that she and Dornan adopted a “pre-game ritual” before getting busy.
The 27-year-old actress, who stars as Anastasia Steele, said she would take a “shot of whiskey (and) mints” before the cameras started rolling.
“He does pushups and I just lay there and drink whiskey,” she said.
Johnson told the outlet that filming the X-rated scenes wasn’t exactly easy, but said she was a lot more comfortable because she and Dornan have “become so close.”
Dornan, who plays the BDSM-obsessed Christian Grey, agreed explaining that he and Johnson barely knew each during the first movie.
“[Now] it’s been three years, [and] Dakota and I are very close,” he told ET. “We’ve got a great sort of love and respect for each other. We’re great friends and I think that makes it easier, you know? So it’s definitely more comfortable.”
