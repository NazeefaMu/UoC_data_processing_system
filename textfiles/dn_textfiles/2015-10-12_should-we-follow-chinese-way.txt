Should we follow the Chinese way

As elders, we always want our children to grow up well to be good, responsible, law abiding, and useful citizens. Children are the pride of our nation. The future of our country depends on how we bring up our children. Our goal should be to promote the children’s well-being so that they could achieve their full potential to become successful learners, confident individuals, effective contributors, and responsible citizens.
Sri Lankan government, at the turn of the millennium having signed a treaty at the UNICEF, undertook that all necessary steps would be taken to provide education to children compulsorily until they are 14 years. It has been revealed that in keeping with the millennium goals, Sri Lanka has miserably failed. It must be placed on record that long before UNICEF laid down such requirements, we Sri Lankans had drawn our own rules for compulsory education and had enforced such requirements effectively in the past, since 1940s thanks to the late C.W.W. Kannangara, father of free education in Sri Lanka. Our achievements had been far superior to even to countries such as Australia – because it was Prime Minister Gough Whitlam who revolutionized free education there in 1972. It is a pity our country has been dragged from riches to rags by our leaders!!

Dr. C. W. W. Kannangara
Our future descendants, no doubt, will hold us responsible. Our actions and policies had eventually carried this country to disastrous plight. We have a moral obligation towards our future generations. Scientists have proved that we would run out of our resources including water. If we continue in this fashion, sustaining the increasing population will not be possible. We should also remember that the polar ice caps and glaciers are also melting and the sea levels appear to be rising. Continuing to act irresponsibly and disregarding the duties - a moral responsibility to slow down these dangers, would be a crime against humanity. We should act now for the sake of our future generations.
Emergency laws
For the past several decades, only those in the corridor of power benefitted and they worked for their own personal gain. The ordinary country men had been simply preoccupied with the struggle for survival. Since independence the country had been mostly under the claws of emergency laws. The majority of our politicians in the past have been selfish, repressive, corrupt and undemocratic. Steps are now being taken to improve the living conditions of the masses because they had to carry the baggage too long since independence due to political incompetence. The masses now deserve a break.
I am aware the older generation, grew up in a society where there was loving kindness, humanity, patience, giving, sharing and compassion – harmlessness to all living beings. The Buddha preached us to practice good virtues (such as inner peace) etc. It may be useful to mention that the Buddha had categorized people in to four different types;
One who adopts a way of life -
* that contributes, neither to the benefit of oneself nor to the welfare of others;
* that does not contribute to one’s own benefit but contributes to the benefit of others;
* that contributes to one’s own benefit but not to the benefit of others; and
* that contributes to one’s own benefit and the benefit of others.
Accordingly, the fourth category (the rarest species) is the most desirable group of people that should be found in larger numbers in any society. In the Kalama Sutta the Buddha has preached - greed, hatred and delusion in people cause detriment to the others - causing misery, destruction of life, steal belongings of others, and indulge in unlawful enjoyment of sensual pleasures and speak untruth.
Select Committees
We therefore need educated leaders who are truthful, committed, dedicated, honest, disciplined and most importantly virtuous, to take the country forward. The virtuous leaders are people with high ethical standards who possess a character - with trust, honesty and integrity. They could make good things happen. They are wave makers. Is it that we did not have good virtuous leaders in our country?
A careful analysis of a majority of our post-colonial leaders show that they were mired in the pursuit of selfish personal goals at the expense of broader national needs or interests. In my view politics is the art or science concerned with the winning and holding control over the government. The winner guides the policies and the distribution of resources of the government. In other words, politics in Sri Lanka is the struggle for power and wealth – the use of depleted resources of the country. My desire is to show the reader that in developed countries, without even a touch of Buddhism, the majority of leaders sought the common good. They respect laws and practice moral values and do not resort to violence or self-centred, mean and prohibitive type of behaviour, causing untold misery to the citizens.
The politicians in those countries never interfered with the duties of the Police. The law too applies to everybody equally and justice is delivered in court rooms expeditiously. Law’s delay are not found, which is one of the root causes for increasing rate of crimes in Sri Lanka. If so, not only rulers - parliamentarians, judiciary and the police are also responsible for dragging the country to a despicable plight. Should we set up a separate Select Committee in Parliament to recommend ways and means to improve the Parliamentarians/Parliament Secretariat, judiciary and the police? If not three Select Committees? This is a must.
Sri Lanka today therefore is at a critical stage since independence. The country faces a severe crisis economically, socially, culturally and politically. It has caused immense problems to the country due to endemic corruption and stupendous wastage of public funds due to bad governance. There has been instances of growth in criminal violence (which is a pointer in regard to state failure) and flawed institutions, a common feature in failed states.
Political leadership since 1970s gave priority to their own personal benefit instead of the well-being of the country and its people. Countrymen should be proud that the educated and politically mature voters used their vote as the ultimate weapon they have to change governments again and again. It is time for the President and the Prime Minister now to device methods more meaningfully to hold parliamentarians responsible even more effectively unlike in the past.
We must remember JAPAN and GERMANY had been reduced to ruins after the world war II. They were able to rise up and develop the two countries to unimaginable heights within a few decades. Why can’t we? Our motherland fortunately has not been reduced to wreckage and rubble after a devastating war. We have the necessary resources to uplift the country if there is a genuine effort. Sri Lanka is therefore not necessarily poor, we should say it is a “less economically developed (LED) country by choice and design. We should in speed move out of poverty – to achieve status - a “developing” or an “industrializing” country.
China’s critics
I must say that the country is now re-born after the 8th January. Our culture, economy, and sustainable development and growth needs to be given a kick-start for the future. If so, should we follow the Chinese path.
According to the United Nations Special Rapporteur on Extreme Poverty and Human Rights, Phillip Alston (Australian), over 2.2 billion people are estimated by the UN to be either near or living in ‘multidimensional’ poverty with over lapping deprivations in health, education and living standards. “This is not an accident” and he added. “It is the result of a series of deliberate and conscious decisions by key actors who have chosen to prioritize other goals”.
China’s critics are not happy the way they handle “public opinion”. The government has been very hard and had taken steps to imprison their dissidents. They had been able to handle most of the big problems in quick speed and similar issues could have taken decades if it was done in a democracy. It is also heartening that in a period of two years China has extended pension coverage to 240 million extra rural dwellers, when in fact it exceeds far beyond the total number of the public pension system in America. The Chinese are prepared, they gladly accept and approve to put up with their system because it delivers sustainable economic growth and development. A survey had shown that 85% Chinese are “very satisfied” with their countries’ progress, when compared with the 31% of Americans.
Wang Jisi of Beijing University has observed that “many developing countries that have introduced Western values and political systems are experiencing disorder and chaos”. Plato’s prediction – “live from day to day indulging the pleasure of the moment” has proved prescient. Our rulers too have not only plundered and went and borrowed internationally to fill their own pockets and to give crumbs to the voters to benefit short term having neglected long term. Should not we too follow the Chinese path if we love our children?
