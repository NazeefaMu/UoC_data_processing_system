Cabinet decides to amend dates of PC polls

 
The Cabinet Ministers decided yesterday to amend dates of the Provincial Council elections to stipulate a new method to conduct elections in all Provincial Councils within one day.
The approval was granted to the proposal made by Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe in concern of the bad impacts caused on financial, resources and democratic aspects when conducting provincial council elections on a staggered basis.
The relevant provisions in Constitution and Provincial Act will be amended to bring about this change.
