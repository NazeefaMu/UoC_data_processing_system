EU Ambassadors call for justice against perpetrators

The European Union in a statement called on the perpetrators of hate crimes to be swiftly brought to justice.
“The recent attacks on communities are very worrying,” the statement read. “It is important that the government and security forces take urgent action against hate crimes and ensure the perpetrators of such actions are swiftly brought to justice.”
The EU notes that it is vital for all political leaders, religious and other community leaders to condemn violence and make every effort to promote understanding and harmony between the communities.
The EU trusts that any action taken under the State of Emergency will be proportionate and respect constitutional rights and freedoms.
