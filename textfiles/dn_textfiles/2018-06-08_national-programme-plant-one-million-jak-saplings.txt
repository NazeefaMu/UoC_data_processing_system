National programme to plant one million jak saplings

A national programme to plant one million jak saplings will be implemented by the Agriculture Ministry to commemorate the 100th anniversary of the jak fruit propagation campaign lead by pioneering philanthropist Arthur V. Dias, popularly known as ‘Kos Mama’.
Addressing the media in this regard at the Government Information Department yesterday, Agriculture Minister Mahinda Amaraweera said the inauguration of the programme will be held at the Jeremias Dias primary school in Panadura on June 11.
Arthur V. Dias started a jak fruit propagation campaign on June 11, 1918, with the aim of planting a million jak fruit saplings.
According to the minister, the ministry plans to provide jak saplings which can bear fruit within 18 to 30 months.
“The ministry will establish crop villages by introducing the most suitable crop for each village considering the climatic condition, soil and other factors required for the crop,” said the minister.
