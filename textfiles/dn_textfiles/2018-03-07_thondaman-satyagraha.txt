Thondaman in Satyagraha

Ceylon Workers Congress Chairman and General Secretary Armugam Thondaman last evening started a Satyagraha opposite the Maskeliya Police station demanding the transfer of the Maskeliya Police OIC.
He said that his supporters face inconvenience as the OIC is discharing his duties to whims and fancies of a certain political party in the plantation sector.
Thondaman added that his discussion with Hatton Assistant Superintendent of Police aiming at the transfer of Maskeliya OIC ended in failure.
Meanwhile, Maskeliya OIC Tyronne Rathnayake said that he has never discharged his duties in a partial manner.
