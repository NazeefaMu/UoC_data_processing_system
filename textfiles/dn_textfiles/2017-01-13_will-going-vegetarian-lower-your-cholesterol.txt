Will going vegetarian lower your cholesterol?

My GP told me my cholesterol has risen from 5.1 to 5.8 mmol/litre.
I wondered about becoming a vegetarian, but the doctor said I should continue with my diet of fish, fruit and vegetables.
What surprises and concerns me is that the cholesterol limit used to be 5, but the GP said it is now 6. What has changed?

As far as I am aware, there has been no recent official change to what is considered to be a safe level of cholesterol, though it has reduced over the years.
When I began practising, it was 7.25 mmol/litre, and now GPs generally accept that healthy adults should have cholesterol levels of 5 mmol/litre or less.
But this is a red herring for patients such as you where the aim is to reduce the chance of developing coronary heart disease and stroke.
This is primary prevention; secondary prevention refers to treatment given after a heart attack or stroke to stop the problem getting worse or recurring.
Helpfully, your letter draws attention to an important shift in thinking about primary prevention.
For years, the focus of primary prevention has been a patient's exact cholesterol levels, but under recent guidelines from the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE), the focus has switched to the patient's risk of coronary heart disease within the next ten years.
This takes cholesterol into account, but not exclusively.
The ten-year risk is assessed by a tool called QRISK2.
This makes a calculation based on a number of factors, including age, sex, body mass index (BMI), ethnicity, family history of heart disease and whether you have diseases including diabetes, high blood pressure and kidney disease, as well as blood cholesterol level.

When the risk is above 10 per cent, the guidelines recommend treatment with a statin — even if your cholesterol levels are not greatly raised.
Your score can be lowered if care is taken to reduce your cholesterol as much as possible with diet.

Some people find their cholesterol levels plummet when they adopt a vegetarian diet, others are unable to lower it this way — there must be genetic reasons for this difference.
Keeping your weight down so your BMI is below 30 (preferably close to 25) and regular exercise can also help.
What matters most is a low QRISK2 score so that your chance of developing coronary heart disease (the cause of death of 11 per cent of the population) is as low as possible.
My advice is to ask your doctor to calculate your QRISK2 score — your decisions can be based on that.
I developed temporomandibular joint disorder a year ago — my jaw becomes stiff and very painful and on a bad day it affects the whole side of my face, ear and down my neck.
The trigger is eating, so I can consume only soft food or food that's cut up small.
My dentist gave me a mouthguard, but it hasn't helped, nor has physio.
I've been referred to hospital, but there's a long waiting list.
