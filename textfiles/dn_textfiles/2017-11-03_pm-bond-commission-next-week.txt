PM before Bond Commission next week

Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe will appear before the Presidential Commission to inquire into the Central Bank Bond issue next week, following a request made by the Commission.
The Commission had requested the Prime Minister to appear before the Commission in order to obtain a few clarifications with regard to the Bond issue.
The Premier had earlier said that he was prepared to appear before the Commission for any clarification that needed to be made.
The Commission sent a list of questions to the Prime Minister for answers by way of an affidavit.
The Commission yesterday affirmed that it had received answers by the Prime Minister.
