National cricketers fail SLC fitness test

A physical fitness test conducted by Sri Lanka Cricket’s physical fitness specialists have found that none of the national team cricketers are on par with the international physical fitness levels.
SLC conducted this physical fitness aptitude test for national team cricketers at the R. Premadasa International Stadium last week and submitted a comprehensive report to top SLC officials and to Sports Minister Dayasiri Jayasekara.
The report recommended that all cricketers selected for the forthcoming Zimbabwe series must take immediate action to improve their physical fitness levels. The role of SLC and Sports Ministry in overcoming this problem will be decisive.
The aptitude test included a distance run (20 meters) and the Yo-Yo test, which is an endurance test. Only Dushmantha Chameera and Lahiru Kumara got through the Yo-Yo test. Lasith Malinga and Seekkuge Prasanna had not participated in the Yo-Yo test.
The international standard time for the 20-metre run is 2.8 seconds and none of the cricketers were able to reach that mark. The players who came close to the mark were Nuwan Kulasekara (2.89 secs) and Lasith Malinga (2.91 secs).
Milinda Siriwardana was clocked at 2.92 secs, Danushka Gunathilaka, Kusal Mendis and Dinesh Chandimal at 2.93 secs, Lahiru Kumara 2.95 secs and Angelo Mathews and Seekkuge Prasanna at 2.97 secs.
Sports Minister Dayasiri Jayasekara recently made comments on the national cricketers’ fitness levels and said that even though we had talented players, their fitness levels were very poor at the moment and that immediate steps should be taken to improve their fitness levels. He also recommended them for military training saying that many countries follow that practice.
“Everyone should undergo a fitness test and only those who reach the required standards will have my approval to represent the national team,” the Minister said.
