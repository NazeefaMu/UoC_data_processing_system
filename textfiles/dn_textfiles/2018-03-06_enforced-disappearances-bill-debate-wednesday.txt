Enforced Disappearances Bill debate on Wednesday

The Draft Bill for protection against enforced disappearances will be debated in Parliament tomorrow after year’s delay.
The Government presented the International Convention for the Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearance Bill in Parliament on March 7, 2017.
The Bill was scheduled to be taken up for debate on July 5 and September 19 last year, but the Government had to defer it amidst the objections of various groups.
The Sri Lankan Government ratified the U.N. International Convention for the Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearances (ICPPED) in December 2015 and the Draft Bill is to satisfy its obligations under the ICPPED.
The Joint Opposition raised objections to the Bill stating that it poses a threat to the Security Forces. However, the Government clarified that the Bill is not retrospective and its main intention is to ensure that every Sri Lankan citizen gets the freedom to live without fear of being a victim of enforced disappearance or abduction. The Bill will be passed following a full day debate.
