New York Times’ bribery allegations: Minister calls for investigations

Irrigation, Water Resources Management and Disaster Management Minister Duminda Dissanayaka said he believes that there is truth in the disclosure of the New York Times that former President Mahinda Rajapaksa has taken a bribe.
“Most of the content that appeared in the newspaper is true because I also received watches and sarees which are still in my possession,” Minister Dissanayake said.
He was speaking to the press after attending several official engagements in Anuradhapura, recently.
The minister said he saw in media reports that former President Rajapaksa has allegedly received bribes from a Chinese company as reported by the New York Times newspaper. He requested the government to inquire into the alleged incident. He said if the said Chinese company had granted such a vast amount of money for the election activities of Mahinda Rajapaksa, such a transaction amounts to a probable bribe. The minister said he wondered as to why the government was being silent over the matter and hoped the government would show more interest to investigate into it.
“I would like to bring to the notice of the government that it is more important to take immediate action to investigate the truth of the news report involving a large scale transaction rather than speaking about small-scale thefts such as stealing a few mangoes,” he said.
“On the surface, there is a clearly convincing truth. But without a legally acceptable investigation, we are unable to confirm the truth of the news item. If any fraud or cheating is proven, the former president, as well as those involved in the alleged fraud, shall be punished for others to learn a lesson,” the minister said.
Referring to the drop in gas prices, he said it was not aimed at the forthcoming provincial council elections. The policy of the government is to allow price hikes or prices lowering according to the price fluctuations in the international market as in the case of gas.
“We don’t depend on commodity prices in getting an election victory,” the minister added. “We demand that the provincial council elections be held as soon as possible. What matters is not winning the elections but to vote for those who are immaculately eligible to administer the councils.
We rejected the optional voting system in Parliament and instituted policies to commence the new voting system. There is no time to spare to do justices to fulfill the wishes of the people. Hard decisions shall be taken to fulfill the expectations of voters who elected a national government. The election pledges and reforms promised shall be fulfilled before going for an election,” Minister Dissanayake said.
