Reprising Sparrow!

 
Johnny Depp's next most anticipated movie is 'Pirates of the Caribbean 5,' in which he will be reprising his role as the infamous pirate captain Jack Sparrow. In a recent interview, the actor talked about how he landed the role and also talked about his acting career.
Depp revealed that when he was first told about playing Jack Sparrow; the meeting only lasted about 37 seconds. The actor and his agent Tracey met with the executives of Disney for another project, but Depp was not interested in being a part of that movie.
After learning that Depp was not interested in the project being discussed, Dick Cook asked the actor if he knew about the 'Pirates of the Caribbean' rides. The actor said that he recalled the ride being one of his favourites as a kid and readily agreed to be a part of the movie.
Depp's agent, however, was not happy about the sudden decision the actor took in the meeting. The franchise, however, became a big hit globally and the actor will next be seen as Jack in 'Pirates of the Caribbean 5.'
The actor revealed that originally, the Jack Sparrow character was written 'as a swashbuckler who comes in and saves the day'. The actor went to a sauna in order to think about the character. The actor felt that it was important for him to go to a 'very hot place' and stay there as long as he could to get his 'Sea legs."'
"I toyed with the idea of what it might be like to live with some species of heatstroke that maybe didn't go away all that quickly," the actor said. The actor felt that being a pirate is more about "rum, sodomy and the lash."
While thinking about all these concepts, the character Jack Sparrow took shape in the actor's mind.
Depp has already finished filming his scenes for 'Pirates of the Caribbean 5.' The movie has been directed by Joachim Ronning and Espen Sandberg and is slated to be released on May 26, 2017. www.ibtimes.com.au
