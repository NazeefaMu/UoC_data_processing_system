Brandix Head of CSR lauded for leading efforts to alleviate water poverty

Head of CSR and Corporate Communications of Brandix Lanka Limited, Anusha Alles, was recognized as one of the world’s ‘100 Most Impactful CSR Leaders’ by World CSR Day during a two-day conference held in Mumbai, India recently.
A forum that brings together 1,200 professionals from 133 countries, the event serves as platform to bring together likeminded leaders with the aim of enhancing knowledge, networking and engaging in meaningful discussions in line with the theme and sub themes of the conference. Significantly, Anusha was also featured on a panel to address the topic, ‘Building and Implementing CSR Strategies’, in line with her expertise.
Brandix has been making a positive impact in the lives of many through its CSR efforts to provide communities access to clean water, through its ‘Care for our Own’ initiative. The concept was designed in response to the pressing need for clean water supply systems among the company’s Associates and their communities, and in line with a vision to contribute to the national goal of providing safe drinking water and sanitation for the entire populace by 2025. The focus on water was also prompted by the vital role it plays towards the manufacturing process in the Apparel industry.
As a result, the Brandix CSR Centre has endeavoured to alleviate the stress of water poverty for women across Sri Lanka under the direction of Anusha, who has played a pivotal role in driving the ‘Care for our Own’ projects with the help of an able team under the four main pillars of ‘Provide’, ‘Educate’, ‘Research’, and ‘Disaster Management’ since 2006. Additionally, the Brandix CSR Centre also conducts programmes that cover livelihood development, construction of housing, and health screenings.
Commenting on the win, Anusha Alles, Head of CSR & Corporate Communications of Brandix Lanka Limited remarked, “I accept this award with a deep sense of humility and dedicate it to my entire team at Brandix. I believe they deserve this much more than I. To me, this award is symbolic of the positive and impactful work done by Brandix over the years in line with our aim to improve the quality of life for all our Associates, who are the backbone of our organisation. We will continue undeterred with our projects to inspire the lives of those impacted by water poverty as part of our journey in Sri Lanka.”
