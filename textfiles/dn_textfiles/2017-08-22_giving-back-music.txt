Giving back to music

When it comes to local talent in Sri Lanka, the talent is huge. We have singers who can perform Western genres and at the same time perform our own Sri Lanka genres like Baila. Then there are singers like Victor Rathnayake and Nanda Malini who are a purely Sri Lankan class of their own. It is this niche that Vijith De Silva falls into.
De Silva has been in the industry for the past 25 years and has planned a concert that will feature the very best of his songs. Melodies speaks to De Silva who is doing this for his fans.
Alongside De Silva, there are a number of talented artistes performing, some of whose names are instantly recognizable. They will give the concert the added boost that is needed.
“It has been 25 years since I put out the cassette ‘Adara Lokaya’. I entered the field in 1992. At this concert I will be doing 22 songs. The artistes who will be playing alongside me are Rohana Bogoda, Jagath Wickramasinghe, Rohan De Silva, Somasiri Madagedara, Champa Kalhari, Dammika Walpola, Charitha Priyadarshani Peiris and Sudath Silva. This concert is free of charge and anyone can come,” said De Silva
This will be a wonderful event for De Silva’s fans and true lovers of music and will feature the best of a 25 year journey that has gathered a devoted fan base. “My fans have always been a source of strength and courage to me.”
De Silva began as a professional photographer. You could say it runs in the family because his father was a photographer as well. However it seems that this talent for photography was equally matched by a talent in music. As a wedding photographer he used to sing songs at weddings. And De Silva decided to make music his vocation. And in doing so cemented his place in the annals of Sri Lankan music. From his younger days he had this ability to make music and doing concerts was inevitable. “1990 I started singing four of my own songs which led to a career in music. In this chosen field of mine I met so many influential people who helped me along my journey. I am doing this for my fans as well as the industry. But I am also doing this concert as a mark of appreciation for all those who touched my life and helped me become the musician that I am now. They have been amazing. I believe in the power of friendship and brotherhood,” said De Silva. De Silva says that Music is a universal language and people naturally become interested in it and fall in love with it. Sri Lanka has a rich musical culture because of greats like Master Amaradeva and Sanath Nandasiri. This was extremely soothing and pleasing to the mind of De Silva. The culture had a lasting effect on the young De Silva.
“Their songs have had an influence on me. My concert is a way of giving back to all of society, for all these positive influences that have shaped my career right throughout,” pointed out De Silva.
De Silva feels fortunate to be in this profession because it is equally rewarding to his fans and to him. The joy that they receive is the joy that De Silva receives. De Silva insists that his journey in music is not phenomenal or fantastic. He maintains he is still continuing in humility. In his career he has formed many warm relationships. A man who has no great expectations he has correctly comprehended the transient nature of life.
“Life is unpredictable and uncertain. When I look at the world I have seen the way misfortune and fate have brought people down. People have been ruined in this world. We have to live life to the best and live in a stable way but we cannot tell what the future holds for us. That is the nature of life. You need a solid foundation,” said De Silva.
His message to anyone is very simple and that is not to be proud but be humble.
The concert will be held at ‘Ape Gama’ Battaramulla at 6.30pm on August 26.
