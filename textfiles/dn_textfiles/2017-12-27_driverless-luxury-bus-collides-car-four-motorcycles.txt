Driverless luxury bus collides with car, four motorcycles

A driverless luxury bus collided with a car and four motorcycles damaging them badly in Vavuniya.
The bus from Colombo to Vavuniya reportedly ran after the driver had parked it by the main road and gone to withdraw cash from a ATM.
A three wheeler driver had noticed the incident and chased after the bus along with a friend. They had managed to stop the bus but only after it collided with a car and four motorcycles.
Even at that time, the bus driver was not aware that his bus had run without him.
Vavuniya police are investigating.
