Drug addicts reintegrated into society

The Bureau of the Commissioner General of Rehabilitation held a reintegration ceremony for rehabilitated drug addicts, at the Tertiary and Vocational Literature Training Centre, Senapura, Welikanda, on June 1.
Fifty-one beneficiaries were reintegrated into society after a one-year period of rehabilitation and were handed over to their next of kin. They had been convicted for drug abuse and sent for treatment at the Rehabilitation Centre, Kandakadu, through a court order.
The Commissioner General of Rehabilitation Major General Janaka Ratnayake told the Daily News that during the first six months, the drug addicts undergo various therapies including counseling, meditation, agro therapy, music therapy and leadership programmes, at the Kandakadu facility.
During the next six months, they are given vocational training, which is useful in improving their livelihood opportunities after reintegration. The participants are trained in welding, plumbing, carpentry, masonry, electrical wiring, computer programmes, etc., at the Senapura facility.
The training programme is conducted under the supervision and guidance of Minister D.M. Swaminathan and Secretary of the Ministry Dr. Ponnaiah Suresh. Upon completion of the vocational training programme, they are awarded the NVQ Level 111 Certificate, which is well recognised and is a great advantage in gaining employment.
The Commissioner General said that currently, only males above 18 are sent to the rehabilitation centre for training, through court orders. However, Cabinet approval has been obtained to accept others who would like to join the programme voluntarily and for the inclusion of males and females over 18 who join voluntarily and through court orders.
“Plans are currently being made to accept around 3,000 persons for the drug rehabilitation programme with 1,500 at Kandakadu and another 1,500 at Senapura. However, we have a few infrastructure problems that we have to overcome and once this is sorted out, we could commence this programme. We require more land to accommodate this number, which is currently being looked into,” he said.
Commissioner General of Rehabilitation Major General Janaka Ratnayake graced the occasion as chief guest. Deputy Commissioner General of Rehabilitation Brigadier Darshana Liyanage, Rev. Sr. Mary Canice and other officials as well as family members of the beneficiaries and staff members also participated.
