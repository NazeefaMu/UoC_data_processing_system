China Southern Airlines to operate direct to Colombo

For the first time China Southern Airlines Company Limited will operate direct flights to Colombo from September 26 from Guangzhou. The airline will operate four flights per week. The airline headquartered in Baiyun District, Guangzhou, Guangdong Province, China will operate flights to Colombo and also to the Maldives.
Established on July 1, 1988 following the restructuring of the Civil Aviation Administration of China that acquired and merged a number of domestic airlines, the airline became one of China’s “Big Three” airlines (alongside Air China and China Eastern Airlines), the world’s fourth-largest airline measured by passengers carried and Asia’s largest airline in fleet size, revenue and passengers carried.
Both Sri Lanka and the Maldives are seeing an increase of tourist arrivals and this is the main reason for the airline to add both Colombo and Male to their radar. Of the total arrivals to Male 30% are from China whileChina is the number one arrival destination for Sri Lanka. (SS)
