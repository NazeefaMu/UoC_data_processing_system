Medhira creates upset to earn final berth

Third seed Medhira Samarasinghe created a major upset by defeating top seed Janali Manamperi in straight sets (6/0, 6/1) to book a final berth in the under-18 girls’ singles event of the ongoing SSC Open Tennis Tournament which was worked off at SSC clay courts yesterday.
The semi final between Janali and Medhira was tipped to be a close fight, but did not create the expected excitement as it turned out to be a one sided game from the beginning. Medhira will meet today's second semi final winner in the final. Second seed Anika Seneviratne who won yesterday's quarter final against Sethara Ambawatte (6/2, 6/1) will battle against fourth seed Tarah Greig in today's crucial second semi final.
In boys’ U-18 singles event, top seed Avindra Perera advanced to semis by beating Nuwantha Dissanayaka (6/3, 6/1) in quarters and will take on Vibuda Wijebandara who beat Vikum Jayasuriya (6/2, 7/6(4)) in semis. Sean Sanderson will play against Udayachandran Srinath while Manal Algama will battle with Thevinda Piyadigama in remaining two quarter finals of U-18 boys' singles today.
