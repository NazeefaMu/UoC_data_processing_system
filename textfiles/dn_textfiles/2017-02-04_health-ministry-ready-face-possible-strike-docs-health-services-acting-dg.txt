Health Ministry ready to face possible strike by Docs: Health Services acting DG

The Health Ministry is ready to face a possible strike by doctors and the strategy of facing the strike could not be revealed. All possible efforts would be taken to solve the issue through discussions with trade unions without letting a strike commence, said Acting Director General of Health Services Dr. Jayasundara Bandara.
Addressing a press conference held at the Health Education Bureau in Colombo yesterday, he said, "Trade union action was the right of the trade unions, but he hope that trade unions would not disregard the plight of the patients and continue with essential services. There were successful discussions that had failed in the past," he said.
Meanwhile, the Media Secretary to the Health Minister Nipun Ekanayake released a voice cut of Health Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne to the media. In the voice cut Minister Dr. Senaratne stated that politically driven elements were try to bring back the previous regime using the SAITM issue.
