Merlin’s Cave

Juliet Coombe goes on a Rock and Roll boat trip to search out the truth about Merlin’s cave...
If you like 18th Century bawdy humour crossed with Monty Python sketches then a 15-minute boat trip to Merlin’s cave for a fiver, four quid or even a tenner, depending on the time of year, with Remond Rossi nicknamed Rem will be one you will never forget in his boat appropriately named Nemesis.
Extremely witty
Having bought into the sales must do boat trip jargon outside the Red Lion pub with lines like ‘pay when you get back or not at all if you hated the tour to Merlin’s mystical waterfall and cave, I could not see a better way to find out more about Clovelly Devon’s picture postcard village, festooned with fuchsias and geraniums than with a character like Rem. “Well” says Rossi as he takes my hand to get onto his boat” do you want to know the real story of the village that has been in the same family since 1738?” which is a place effectively owned by one man Johnny.
As he tells me about the area he drops into the conversation that he wrote a book called The Arthurian Legends of Clovelly, which you can buy on Amazon for £1.50. “I say book, more of a pamphlet” but it tells you all about Merlin and the waterfall, which got its name in truth because of a hermit with had an incredibly long beard, hanging out in a cave there some 300 years ago. Villagers tell, in hushed whispers, that Merlin’s body is walled up behind the waterfall.
If boats are not your thing you can do a stony, pebbly ten minute rock walk to the sparkling Merlin falls, which cascade down the cliff only a little more precipitously than the village does! Of course Rem does not tell anyone this when you meet him on the Quay, as he wants you to go on his extremely witty 15-minute boat tour that could be half an hour or longer depending on his mood. In his book he, of course, reveals the truth of the matter, which is that Arthurian magician Merlin was born there. Walking under the magical falls one could half believe this is true as the place does hold some kind of magic to it.
Shakespearian accent
Pointing to the forest above the village, looking very much like the hair of prehistoric man, he says you know you’ve really made it in the big city when you can afford to come down here and shoot a pheasant at £37.50 a bird. On average every year 50,000 birds get killed this way and why? Well I have a theory you become a celebrity, get rich and do it as some sort of rite of passage. “Bag a pheasant and somehow you’ve really made it, it is weird if you ask me and afterwards they book my shanty band Fife’s Ruse named after one of the rocks along the coast and the late Fife, a good ole boy from the area who died around the time the band formed. I only do the booking as it is amusing to terrorise these bird killers for a few hours.”
Besides being the captain of the Nemesis, and out all night on the band circuit, Rem is also a part time film negotiator for the area and he has worked on plenty of exciting productions like the Dianna Rigg 1920s period drama for the BBC and has even appeared in a few big blockbuster movies himself. Irish Jam being his favourite as he plays alongside the delectable Anna Friel in an extremely lively Irish band sequence in St. Agnes in Cornwall, which was meant to look just like a good old fashioned Irish Tavern. “As more people have come to film in the area,” he says proudly, “we set up an extras production house and provide all sorts of fat, pretty or whatever extras. Of course as a negotiator I tell them they are going to need quite a budget. I mean closing Clovelly’s ancient harbour for a few days’ costs hoards in lost tourist dollars and the multi-million pound fishing industry and of course there is also a lot of poetic licence in this, but that’s the movies, you have got to be creative and expensive or why do it?”

Pointing to the top end of the village he says, “We have our very own celebrity actor living here among us, Joss Ackland, who orders lobsters from me.”At first when he called me saying “You must have lobsters, in a truly Shakespearian accent, I thought that was him acting and now, after rather a lot of beer sessions to see if he can sway the price on delivery, I realise that is what he truly sounds like. Of course I know being plied with beer is a ruse to get me so drunk I forget altogether about collecting the payment.” It is Joss he says proudly who made the film about the history of Clovelly and its 600 year old Quay that was built in the 14th century and extended in the 16thcentury by George Cary for a mere £2000 pounds, which included building all the harbour cellars, warehouses and other edifices. A film is shown every 20 minutes each day at the visitors centre, that covers this and more about the area’s rich history and when I asked why he is not in it, he replied “well I can’t be in everything and really I am a ‘gown and town’ kind of guy admitting on the quiet that he was originally a London townie who came here 40 years ago and simply fell in love with the place.
The high season
Rem asks me on the way back to the town how old I think the white bearded skipper is. Before I can reply he says, “103, possibly older and the only way we can be sure is by cutting his head off and counting the rings. He also doubles as Merlin and maybe he is the one you see on the Internet promoting Clovelly?”
On longer trips and in the high season lots of wildlife can be seen like pilot whales and porpoises, not to mention it is an excellent spot to go fishing for cod, herring and maybe some left over treasure from one of the hundreds of wrecks in the area. Of course to be sure of wildlife you need to take a boat to Lundy Island about an hour offshore and always in these high seas there is an adventure and a half, especially if in an electric boat.
Rem tells us to check out Clovelly’s little fisherman’s cottage showing how hard things were in the 1930s and the Kingsley museum. The boat tour ends as suddenly as it started and we clamber back up the steep beach stone steps to the quay and as he waves goodbye to us, his patter starts again for the next trip, hailing passersby to come on the next exciting tour of a life time, only turning back to us for payment and pulling a bit of change from his pocket he says “I hope to see you at my gig at the Red Lion pub on Monday night at 9.” I ask how many people will be playing with him “five maybe 10” he replies nonchantly as some of them are so old they have either died or might simply forget to turn up. If you cannot make the gig check us out on You-tube we do an excellent version of “What do you do with the drunken sailor” and with a wink and a doff of his invisible cap he says in his typical gallows humour, “We are like Ebola, we have gone viral.”
