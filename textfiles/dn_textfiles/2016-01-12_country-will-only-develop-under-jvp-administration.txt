'Country will only develop under JVP administration'

 
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe is dangling the proposed new constitution before the people, in an effort to detract attention from burning issues, Parliamentarian and President of the Socialist Youth Federation Bimal Ratnayake said.
He was speaking at a district seminar organised by the Socialist Youth Federation in Anuradhapura. Ratnayake said that while they were not opposed to formulating a new constitution, several issues in the country needed to be resolved first.
He said the so called good governance policy has severely deteriorated. Public outburst had ensured the arrest of Parliamentarian Hirunika Premachandra, even if only for 20 minutes before release on bail - but those responsible for the murder of rugby player Wasim Thajudeen were still at large: Not a single corrupt individual of the previous regime has been brought to book and punished so far, he said.
Ratnayake said the last 60 years, since Independence, had only proved the Sri Lanka Freedom Party and the United National Party's inability to rebuild and develop the country. The country would only develop under a JVP administration. Therefore, the JVP must gear up to establish administration by 2020, he said.
He also said that while the media had lauded the students who showed excellence at the G.C.E. Advanced Level Examination, it should not be forgotten that only a meagre 25,000 of the 149,000 students who sat the exam qualified to enter university. The rest of the students are languishing at home with no hope for the future, he said.
The Parliamentarian also charged that Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe had promised to set up a Volkswagen factory in Kuliyapitiya, but had not even appointed a security officer to the factory, a year since making the promise.
