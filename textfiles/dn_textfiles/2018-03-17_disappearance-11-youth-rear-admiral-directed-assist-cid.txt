Disappearance of 11 youth: rear admiral directed to assist cid

Colombo Fort Magistrate Court yesterday issued an order directing the Navy Commander that Rear Admiral Ananda Guruge be referred to the CID to record a statement regarding the investigations into the disappearance of 11 youth in Colombo.
Magistrate Lanka Jayaratne made this order pursuant to a request made by CID through a motion.
Filing a motion in court, the CID complained that Rear Admiral Guruge had disregarded court orders, even though he was noticed to appear before the CID to make a statement regarding the incident.
At a previous occasion, the Magistrate rejected a request made by the defence that investigations pertaining to former Navy Spokesman Commodore D.K.P Dassanayake and nine others be transferred from the CID to any other police station.
In this case, former Navy Spokesman Commodore D.K.P Dassanayake and nine others are accused of aiding and abetting the abduction and disappearance of 11 youths in 2008 and 2009.
The missing persons had been abducted by an unidentified group at Dehiwala, Battaramulla and Wattala in 2008 and 2009.
