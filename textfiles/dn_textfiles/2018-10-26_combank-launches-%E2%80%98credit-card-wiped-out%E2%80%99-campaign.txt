COMBANK launches ‘Credit Card wiped-out’ campaign

Fortune will smile on Credit Card holders of Commercial Bank with the launch of a new ‘COMBANK Credit Card Balance Wiped-off’ campaign which will wipe out a total of Rs 5.25 million in credit card spends over the next three months.
To be eligible, holders of Visa or Mastercard Credit Cards issued by the Commercial Bank must spend Rs 25,000 or more via their cards within a month. Every Rs 25,000 spent or multiples of Rs 25,000 will generate an additional winning chance, the Bank said.
Bill wipe-outs of up to Rs 100,000 will be executed for 10 eligible Credit Cardholders each month from October to December. Additionally, another qualifying 15 Cardholders will have upto Rs 50,000 wiped out each month until the campaign ends.
In all, 75 Commercial Bank Credit Cardholders with a minimum monthly spend of Rs 25,000 stand a chance to have their credit balances reduced by a maximum of Rs 100,000 before the year runs out, the Bank said.
“Commercial Bank always strives to offer the best possible deals to its cardholdersand the timing of this new campaign isparticularly fortuitous because it encompasses the December shopping season. We had a very successful Debit Card promotion for three months and now we want to reward our valuable Credit Card holders,”Commercial Bank’s Head of Card Centre Thusitha Suraweera said. “Withthis, the Bank has given the festive season an early start.’
Commercial Bank Credit and Debit Cards offer year-round promotions covering a wide variety of services. Commercial Bank was the first bank to offer loyalty rewards for both Credit and Debit Cardholders under its Max Loyalty Rewards scheme. The Bank was also a pioneer in extending promotional discount offers, which were traditionally only offered for Credit Cards to its Debit Cards.
Commercial Bank cards are the fastest growing cards in Sri Lanka and enjoy market leadership in Credit and Debit Card cumulative point-of-sale usage. The Bank offers a variety of Credit Cards in the Silver, Gold and Platinum tiers of both Visa and Mastercard as well as Visa Signature, World Mastercard and Visa Infinite cards in the premium segment. The cards are equipped with ‘Tap n Go’ NFC technology and are backed by a strong NFC Point-of-Sale (POS) network.
