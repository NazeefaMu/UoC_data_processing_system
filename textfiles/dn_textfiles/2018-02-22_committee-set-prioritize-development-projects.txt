Committee set up to prioritize development projects

A committee headed by Minister Dr. Sarath Amunugama has been appointed to make a priority list of mega projects the government can implement within the next two years.
The committee comprising both SLFP and UNP ministers would set the economic priorities of the government and decide on which ones will have the greatest impact on the people.
Co-Cabinet spokesperson Minister Dr Rajitha Senaratne addressing the weekly Cabinet media briefing at the Government Information Department said, the President had informed the Cabinet this week that all mega projects would have to be approved by this committee.
Accordingly, Education Minister Akila Viraj Kariyawasam’s proposal to introduce tabs to all schoolchildren at a cost of Rs. 4 billion was rejected by the President on the grounds that complete implementation was not a current economic priority, said Minister Senaratne.
“The President pointed out that instead of spending Rs. 4 billion on the project, it would be more prudent to implement it in phases and start with a pilot project using 20 percent of the cost. He then asked that they measure its effectiveness and response from the students and proceed from there,” he said.
Several other proposed mega projects too have been postponed until they receive the go-ahead from this committee which will evaluate their national importance.
“We also have a debt ceiling to worry about. So we cannot take loans for every project,” he said.
The third phase of the Central Expressway project, however, received the green light from the Cabinet despite several questions raised on it this week. “We decided that this needs to be implemented as it was also a promise we made in our manifesto,” said the minister. Section 3 of the Expressway from Pothuhera to Galagedara via Rambukkana has been awarded to M/s Taisei Corporation of Japan pending the signing of loan negotiations for 100 billion Yen from the Bank of Tokyo Mitsubishi and Nippon Export and Investment Insurance.
The Cabinet paper for the project was presented to the Cabinet by Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe.
