Police protection provided to Wijith Wijesuriya

Wijith Wijesuirya, brother of Anika Wijesuriya, a witness who testified before the Presidential Commission of Inquiry probing the Bond issue has been afforded extra security following a request he made to the Attorney General's Department.
"Wijith who is also a witness of the inquiry has made a request to the AG's Department asking for extra security," Police spokesperson SP Ruwan Gunasekera told Daily News. "The commission has also requested that he be provided with the same."
Gunasekera said that Wijesuriya had not made a formal complaint of any threats to his life and that the police protection given to him was based on his and the commission's request only.
Wijith's sister Anika fled the country this week following death threats. President's Counsel Yasantha Kodagoda said during a session of the hearing held on Tuesday (17).
