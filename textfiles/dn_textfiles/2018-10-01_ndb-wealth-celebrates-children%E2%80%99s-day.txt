NDB Wealth celebrates Children’s Day

Sometimes the smallest decisions can be the most rewarding ones. For Children’s Day, celebrated in Sri Lanka on October 1, 2018, don’t just spend on toys or other gifts offering purely impulsive, short-term benefits.
Take your first baby step towards the most important and rewarding decision in your life by investing in your children and their dreams, empowering them to achieve a financially independent future for themselves.

Money Plus for Kids, from expert financial planner NDB Wealth, has been particularly designed to offer your child, and you, a hardworking savings plan that gives attractive returns. Taking full advantage of Money Market Funds, which are ideally suited for those who are unsure where to begin, Money Plus for Kids enables you to take charge of your family’s future. Simple to invest in, and easy-to-use, these plans earn significantly more than traditional bank savings accounts locally, with the income credited daily.
“Keeping the money for your kids tied up until the child is 18 years old means the safety of the funds and returns become very important factors for you to consider in deciding where to open the account and what type of product you should select. If you opt for a Money Plus for Kids account, which has a Current Yield of 10.85% as of September 24, 2018, and deposit either a lump sum or save a small amount regularly, your child will receive a significantly higher amount by the time he or she is 18 years. That is why NDB Wealth’s Money Plus for Kids is the best option singularly catering to the needs, and dreams, of growing children, giving them the only benefit that really matters - an attractive rate of return,” according to young father Laknada De Mel, Assistant Vice President and Head of Private Wealth Management at NDB Wealth.
