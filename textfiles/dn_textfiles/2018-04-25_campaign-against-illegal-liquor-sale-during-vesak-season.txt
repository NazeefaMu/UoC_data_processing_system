Campaign against illegal liquor sale during Vesak season

An extensive campaign to monitor the unethical activities of liquor stalls, will be implemented by the Excise Department during the Vesak festive season.
The campaign will be effective from April 27 to May 3. All licensed liquor stalls in the country would be closely monitored by Excise officials, giving prominence to public complaints and tip-offs.
All operations would be conducted upon the instructions of Excise Commissioner R. Somasingha.
The Law Enforcing Unit of the Customs Department would monitor all operations while a special mechanism would be established in the Excise Department to observe the progress of operations carried out with 24-hour surveillance.
The Excise Department seeks the help of the public to mitigate illegal liquor distribution in the island.
