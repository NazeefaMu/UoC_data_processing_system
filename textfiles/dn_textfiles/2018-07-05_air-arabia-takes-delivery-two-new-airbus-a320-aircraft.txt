Air Arabia, the Middle East and North Africa’s first and largest low-cost carrier (LCC), announced it has taken two new Airbus A320 aircraft deliveries bringing its total operating fleet to 53 aircraft.
The latest Airbus A320 arrived on schedule from the Airbus facility in Toulouse, France, marking the completion of all deliveries this year.
Adel Al Ali, Group Chief Executive Officer, Air Arabia, said, “The delivery of our last two aircraft for 2018 marks a significant step in the development of our fleet expansion strategy especially as we added 12 new routes this year. We are proud to have created one of the industry’s most modern fleet through exceptional organic growth which helped us offer customers a wider range of destinations at great value.”

All Air Arabia aircraft cabin interiors are fitted with a world-class comfort seats offering one of the highest seat pitch of any economy cabin across the globe and therefore, offering passengers extra leg room to sit back and relax during their flight.
