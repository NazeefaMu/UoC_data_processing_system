Immediate steps should be taken to protect rubber lands: CRTA

The Colombo Rubber traders’ Association (CRTA) recently highlighted the importance of protecting the country’s rubber industry, which has a long history over 100 years, and said authorities should take immediate measures to stop clearing valuable rubber lands for industrial or any other purpose.
CRTA Chairman Sunil Poholiyadda made these observations in Colombo recently.
Plantation Industry Ministry Advisor Lakna Paranawithana and Chamber Representative Alikle Perera were present.
It was highlighted that the main purpose of forming the CRTA was to facilitate efficient and transparency among sellers, producers, buyers, exporters and dealers to assist the growth and sustainability of the Rubber Industry in Sri Lanka and also promote Sri Lanka’s Rubber and Rubber products in global markets.
Chairman Poholiyadda said the plan would increase the local rubber production up to 30,000 metric tonnes by the year 2045. The Chairman said the Planters’ Association had identified that over 2,500 hectares of rubber lands of regional plantation companies were going to be cleared for industrial purposes.
He said clearing rubber lands due to urbanization had posed a major threat to the industry.
He said the CRTA would appeal the Government to look into this matter as such a situation would drop the country’s rubber production in future.
Chairman Poholiyadda said the country’s rubber production had reduced to 79 million kilos last year from a record number of 88 million kilos achieved during 2015.
He said the adverse weather conditions prevailed in the past was another reason for the drop in the country’s rubber production. “Seventy percent of the country’s rubber production is coming from smallholders and with the drop in price, many rubber growers either discontinue the harvesting or uprooted rubber trees to generate funds.” He said a few years ago the price of a rubber kilo went up to Rs. 600 and in 2016, a kilo of the same rubber was dropped to Rs. 200.
He said the prices of natural rubber was increased up to Rs. 400 at the Colombo auction this month.
The Chairman said the domestic consumption of rubber had increased from 127 million kilos in 2015 to 142 million kilos in 2016 .
He reminded the authorities that many plantation companies were interested in expanding rubber cultivation and if alternative additional land was offered to the RPC’S even in non-traditional areas, they would gladly accept the offer to expand the rubber cultivation. Plantation Industry Ministry Advisor Lakna Paranawithana mentioned the already launched `Rubber Master Plan ‘ and said that the preparations of this plan was being done.
He said the Ministry had completed the establishment of the Rubber Secretariat at Diyawanna Gardens to develop the industry.
