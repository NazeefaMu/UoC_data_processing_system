Kandy SC gives Marija a fitting farewell

Kandy Sports Club gave their star performer Fazil Marija a fitting farewell by recording their 14th consecutive win in as many matches to end the Dialog ‘A’ division league rugby tournament as unbeaten champions for yet another year.
Kandy SC’s Fazil Marija waves to the crowd on his farewell appearance at Nittawela.
Yesterday at Nittawella they thwarted a strong comeback in the second half by Havelocks SC to win by 30 points (2 goals, 2 tries, 2 penalties) to 28 (4 goals) after leading 22-0 at half time.
The winners got the better of their opponents with some well taken tries in front of a passionate home crowd. The hosts made the perfect start, with some good run and pass rugby. In the first half Havelocks were desperately lacking in quality and were dull in continuing to kick long even though had some good players to feed them every time.
In the second half Havelocks came back to the game and handled the ball well to score 28 points and cause some concern in the Kandy camp. Their play was superb in the second half where they were able to score four tries all of which were converted. They got off to a perfect start in the second half and took the ball up to the goal line on all occasions and were also good in attack and defence.
But Kandy, who knows how to win matches, was obviously superior for a number of reasons. Most obviously the speed of their ruck ball and their breakdown work was of the highest order with Fazil Marija who was playing his last game at Nittawela enjoying one of his finest games for the club. He ended up scoring three superb tries. He constantly taunted and teased the Park club defence and also his box-kicks were expertly done.
Kandy’s forward play was also magnificently reliable, with all forwards having an excellent match.
The scorers for Kandy were Fazil Marija three tries, Gayan Weeraratne one with the kicking part being done by Nigel Ratwatte.
For Havelocks Lasindu Karunatilake scored two tries and there was one each from Sudam Suriarachchi and Liston Fanty. Reeza Mubarak did all the kicking.
And at the end of the game Kandy SC skipper Gayan Weeraratne received the Dialog league trophy.
Referee: Rosahn Fernando.
