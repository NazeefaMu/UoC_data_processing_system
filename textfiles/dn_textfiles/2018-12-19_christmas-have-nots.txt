Christmas with have-nots

In the end, it’s not the years in your life that count. It’s the life in your years, said Abraham Lincoln.
As I entered the kingdom of old people, I felt odd sensations in my stomach because I was anticipating a lot of things in advance. In the beginning, I said nothing to anybody as I was just scanning the whole environment with my naked eyes. Life is too short to anticipate things. We frame different outputs without understanding the whole scenario.
Love doesn’t recognize any language. It is not bounded by any external powers. We only restrict ourselves. Stop wasting your time in criticizing or feeling jealous about someone else’s life.
Understand the power of attraction. So, spread love and attract more love in return.
The evening of December 15 was a great day of joy to the occupants of the Home for the Aged. Their lifestyle was monotonous, staying away from their loved ones, in a concrete square.
The Christmas party made them gain back the lost spirit. Sarvodaya Suwasetha Director Neetha Ariyaratne graced the occasion as the chief guest. She was welcomed by Ralf de Almeida, President of the Social and Welfare Committee.
After lighting of the Christmas candles in traditional style and hoisting the National Flag, the event kicked off. The Christmas messages were delivered by Rev Fr Adriean of the Holy Emmanuel Church and a Chief Pastor of the Salvation Army and Farms Lanka (Pvt) Ltd Managing Director Clarance Mendis.
The programme was held in two segments. The President and the Board Members conduct a Nursery for children.
The children performed many skits for entertainment while the seeyas and Achchis performed a lovely Carol singing. Though they were old, their voices were young.
After their performances gifts were distributed by the Chief Guest later the Board Members and Teachers followed up for the inmates and the little ones.
Shock, pity and thankfulness- the three main emotions I felt after the visit to Old Age Home. The trip was a great overall experience, and I gained a lot from it.
Though I am not ignorant of the less fortunate or the elderly at all, sitting with, and talking to them, was a whole new experience! I had never visited an old age home before, but what I had seen on T.V back home was totally different. I didn’t expect it to be at all the same, but nevertheless, the cold reality of it struck me hard.
Listening to their stories of losing wife and child during delivery, being widowed, consecutive heart attacks, losing children in accidents, being abandoned by their families, or never getting married to start with, astonished and moved me. Though they all said they were happy, I couldn’t help but think it was because that was the best they had seen, or they had no option left.
