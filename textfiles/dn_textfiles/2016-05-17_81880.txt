Top Ten finish for Jaden and Aaron at Asian Road Racing Championship

The round two of the Asian road racing championship was held in Thailand last Sunday at the Chang International circuit. Young brothers Jaden and Aaron both clinched top 10 positions in their respective events. Jaden rode a Honda mono cylinder 250cc for the second consecutive year, while Aaron opted to join the Suzuki Challenge on the new EFI 150cc this year. The young Sri Lankans did not have it easy as they were up against the all Japan Champ Hiroki Nakamura and the son of former MotoGP rider Noriyuki Haga as well as top names from Australia, Thailand, Philippines, Malaysia, India, Indonesia, China, Chinese-Taipei, Vietnam, Nepal etc.. Aaron who finished 10th on the grid and Jaden 14th in their respective events, worked their way through the experienced riders on the race day to finish among the top ten.
A Proud father Shane Gunawardena said he is really happy about Jaden’s performance, perhaps even happier for his younger son Aaron as he has no experience in running underbone motorcycles and what made him proud was the fact that he was among the best in Asia. A top ten finish was what they targeted and I am glad that it was achieved.
The next Asian Championship would be on the Suzuka Circuit in Japan and Jaden would be riding the two hour endurance race too.
Shane also went on to say that It has not been easy for them especially with their studies, therefore they would be reluctantly compelled to skip a couple of local meets including the National Championship rounds.
