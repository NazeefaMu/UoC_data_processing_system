The role of scientists in development frontier

Professional scientists are the intellectual professionals with strong academic background and research competencies and working in the government affiliated research and development institutions. With their expertise they make an excellent contribution for research and development interventions in the efforts for the development in Sri Lanka.
The establishment of the Professional Association of Scientists of Sri Lanka (PASS) on March 10, 2015 with the participation of scientists who are serving in the government affiliated research institutions symbolizes a landmark event of the research and development sector of Sri Lanka.
Aims
Prior to independence, several public sector research institutions had been established for sectors such as plantations and fisheries. However, in parallel with the post independent socio-economic and political reforms, the existing and the newly established research and development institutions were brought under the government affiliated institutions. This enabled such institutions to function as independent institutions to a certain level for the improved functional productivity and efficiency without the direct control of the central government.
Professional scientists are the backbone of these institutions providing a devoted and a silent service for more than six decades to the nation.
The scientists who provide an enormous service in key economic sectors such as agriculture, industry and services have not been apprised properly since the commencement of these institutions. The PASS is the frontier command of the countrywide scattered professional scientists of government affiliated research institutions working under conditions of very minimum facilities and limited privileges compared with the similar categories of public sector.
Deviating from mere traditional trade unionism, a key objective of the PASS is the active participation in formulation of national research and development policies to fulfill the anticipated goals of socio-economic development of the country and providing intellectual contribution to the government through research and development interventions.
Furthermore, the PASS will directly involve in securing professional standards, privileges and rights of scientists by becoming the ‘National Voice’ of the professional scientists of government affiliated research institutions. Through this effort the PASS will be able to generate contented ‘Scientific Community’ and that will lead to speed up of the country’s economic development.
The PASS will be devoted to offer professional guidance to the government to bring long lasting solutions to the critical problem of “brain drain” which has been having adverse impacts on the development of the country for a number of decades. Moreover, the PASS will open up windows for an intellectual dialogue among the scientific community by creating coordination and communication among professional scientists to make a reality of the government’s interest in making Sri Lanka the centre of fivefold power of Asia.
Challenges of the research and development sector
Research and development policy of a country is the main determinant of the socio-economic development of that country. Hence, the PASS stresses the importance of the implementation of a sustainable and updated research and development policy as of national interest for the accelerated socio-economic development of Sri Lanka. Unfortunately, no concurrent national policy on research and development had been implemented since the independence and as a result of this failure Sri Lanka’s dream to be the knowledge centre of the SAARC region has not become a reality as yet.
The share of GDP for research and development expenditure and the economic development of a country are correlated indispensably. This is clearly indicated by all economic indicators of developed as well as countries identified as the ‘East Asian Miracle’ such as Singapore, Thailand, Malaysia and South Korea. All developed countries maintain research and development expenditure as a share of more than 2% of the GDP.
Prior to 1980s, Singapore, Thailand, Malaysia and South Korea remained far below Sri Lanka in terms of all social and economic indicators. Now Sri Lanka is lagging behind all these countries in terms all social and economic indicators.
The secret of this unbelievable transformation is the realization of the importance of research and development (R&D) as an essential precondition for the accelerated economic development by the policy makers of those countries followed by the subsequent increase of the share of GDP on voted expenditure for research and development. For instance, South Korea, Malaysia and Singapore retained R&D expenditure as a percentage of GDP 4.04, 1.07, and 2.1 respectively.
But sadly this figure for Sri Lanka is about 0.16%. Among the SAARC countries, Sri Lanka shows the lowest and Pakistan, Nepal, and India allocate 0.33%, 0.30% and 0.81% respectively as R&D expenditure from the GDP.
Hence, the PASS strongly insists the government to increase the voted expenditure for R&D at least to 1% of GDP for a scientific and technological revolution which is the precondition for the takeoff of the economic development of Sri Lanka.
According to the new government’s proposed budgetary allocation for the next year it is targeted to increase the voted expenditure on higher education to 6% of GDP. The PASS foresees this as a constructive step and requests the government to pay similar unique attention to the R& D sector of Sri Lanka.
