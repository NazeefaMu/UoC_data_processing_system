Digital Economy Strategy to be launched in April

Sri Lanka plans to launch the proposed Digital Economy Strategy in April, which could uplift the nation’s economic growth by around 1-3 percent in 2019, the Prime Minister’s Office said in a statement.
At a Steering Committee meeting held on January 4 at the Policy Development Office at Temple Trees where the inception report was presented, it was decided that the diagnostics phase of the assignment would commence by January 15 and last a period of two weeks. This would be followed by a five-week design phase, during which it is expected to have relevant programmes and projects identified and ready to be launched by early April, 2018.
McKinsey and Company, while presenting their inception report, confirmed that the proposed digital economy strategy for Sri Lanka, could uplift Sri Lanka’s GDP by 1 - 3 percent in 2019, the statement said.
Explaining the initiative, the Prime Minister’s office said, “In the middle of December, 2017, the Telecommunication and Digital Infrastructure Ministry, with the support of McKinsey and Company, embarked on the process of developing Sri Lanka’s digital economy.
This initiative would enable Sri Lanka to scientifically identify the appropriate opportunities for the promoting of Sri Lanka’s digital economy and the key enablers to promote the digital economy, as well as initiate three flagship programmes that would promote Sri Lanka’s digital economy strategy.”
According to the Premier's office, the current consultancy with McKinsey and Company is a short-term eleven-week assignment which would be conducted in three phases.
The first phase would focus on the diagnostics to develop an understanding of Sri Lanka’s readiness to move into the digital economy.
The second phase would concentrate on designing three flagship programmes to initiate the digital economy and ten projects to establish key enablers to support the digital economy. The final phase would focus on launching the identified programmes and projects.
This initiative would strategise the promotion of the digital economy through the lens of three economic development thrust sectors, namely the agriculture, tourism and manufacturing sectors.
It is expected that each of these sectors would develop at least one flagship programme to support this initial stage of Sri Lanka’s Digital Economy Strategy.
