IT industry to focus on  data - science, AI

Sri Lanka’s IT industry is confident that they can achieve the export target of USD 5 billion by 2022, as the industry is now focusing on more business based on data-science and artificial intelligence (AI).
Chairman Sri Lanka Association for Software and Services Companies (SLASSCOM) and Co-Founder Hatch, Jeevan Gnanam said the IT industry professionals are now moving towards developing data-science education and encouraging youngsters to choose more futuristic educational lines than lamenting on undersupply of IT graduates.
“Diversification is the key to success. We are moving on to the data-science era from the IT software era. There are also new educational methods and training programs which can be completed within a short span. So young people should be encouraged to go into these areas, Gnanam said joining the discussion on ‘Turnaround; Shifting Gear from Slow to Fast Track’.
