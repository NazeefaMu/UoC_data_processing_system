Passing of budget a victory for govt - Rajitha

The 2016 budget passed with 159 votes was a major achievement for the government, Health Minister and Cabinet spokesman Dr. Rajitha Senaratne said.
Addressing the media at the Information Department yesterday, Minister Senaratne said if MPs Buddhika Pathirana and Ven. Rathana Thera were present, the number of votes would have exceeded 160.
Referring to the countrywide strike by several trade unions, he said it was an attempt to pressurise the government and the budget. The minister assured that the government will be victorious in all its future endeavours.
