The enduring  appeal of Ikebana

Ikebana Artistry 2017, an exhibition of creations presented by the Ikebana students of Shiromi Soosaipillai will take place November 11 and 12 at the air conditioned JDA Gallery, University of the Visual and Performing Arts, 46 Horton Place Colombo 7.
Shiromi, who grew up on a plantation, always appreciated nature, but formally started learning the art of Ikebana in 1983 under Kamala Pillai, founder of the Shi-en Ikebana and Floral Arts Society of Sri Lanka.
Today she follows the Sogetsu method founded in 1926 by Sofu Teshigahara, whose mantra was that Ikebana “can be done by anyone, anywhere, anytime with any kind of material.”
A qualified teacher, Shiromi has been teaching for four years. Christopher Lim from Singapore fine-tuned Shiromi’s Ikebana creations and has advised and guided her throughout her teachers’ diploma training in Singapore and continues to do so.
She has attended Ikebana International Asian Regional conferences in Hyderabad, Manila, Delhi and Taipei, as well as the Ikebana International world conventions in Tokyo and Okinawa.
Shiromi’s students are all professional women. “Some of my students are training to be Ikebana teachers, so it’s time to give them some exposure, and it’s also the first time I am exhibiting my own work independently.”
There will be 50 pieces on show at Ikebana Artistry 2017, some in traditional style, some unconventional. The Sogetsu School has introduced a new syllabus which permits non conventional material such as glass, wire, metal, paper, cloth and so on.
Exhibitors include Asha Vasan, Durga Dev, Kazuko Isawa, Deenesha Wickremasinghe and Luna Bose who have been Shiromi’s students for the past three years and more. They are academically or professionally qualified – a medical doctor, an IT specialist, science graduates and a graphic designer and have all found Ikebana to be a therapeutic and meditative art form and gratifying hobby.
The students are at varying stages in the Sogetsu curriculum and will showcase their own interpretation of this wonderful art using fresh material, dried items, drift wood, unconventional material and even coral.
“Ikebana is about freedom of expression. You have to be able to create your own thing. It’s a great stress reliever and a very therapeutic pastime,” Shiromi reiterates. “Wherever I go I’m always looking at and admiring natural settings, trees, branches, because this is the source of inspiration.”
The aim of the two Ikebana societies in Sri Lanka, Shi -en Ikebana and Floral Arts Society of Sri Lanka and Ikebana International, Sri Lanka Chapter, of which Shiromi is a founder member and past president, is to promote the art to encourage people, even beyond Colombo to participate.
