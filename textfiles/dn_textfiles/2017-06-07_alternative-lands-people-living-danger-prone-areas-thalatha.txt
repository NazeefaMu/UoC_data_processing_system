Alternative lands to people living in danger prone areas: Thalatha

The government has taken steps to provide alternative lands to people who live in danger prone areas earmarked by the National Building Research Organisation (NBRO), said Foreign Employment Minister Thalatha Athukorale.
Addressing a press conference held at UNP Headquarters, Sirikotha on Monday, Minister Athukorale said they were thankful to all and sundry who joined hands to provide relief to the disaster affected people expeditiously. This includes the President, Prime Minister, parliamentarians, all public servants including Grama Niladharis’ and private sector employees. The quick response shown by the Prime Minister who summoned a meeting by 9 a.m. on May 26 and issued necessary instructions helped to save many lives. A special thanks should also go to the Armed Forces, Police and Civil Security Department too, who helped in the rescue operations.
Athukorale said the President had ordered the authorities to offer unlimited stocks of provisions and relief goods to the disaster affected people. She said compensation payments in respect of the dead, which was Rs. 15,000 per person had now been increased to Rs. 100,000. She said the death toll in Ratnapura district alone accounted to nearly 100.
Delving on the functions of the Sri Lanka Bureau of Foreign Employment, Athukorale said the SLBFE which ran at a loss from 2011 to 2014 had recorded a profit of Rs. 1.27 billion in 2016.
This had been achieved by cutting down unnecessary expenditure. Asked by the media about another possible Cabinet reshuffle, she said they should ask the President about it. They on their part had no problem even if there was another reshuffle.
