MDMK chief Vaiko sent to judicial custody for pro-LTTE speech

 
A Chennai court sent Marumalarchi Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (MDMK) chief Vaiko to 15 days’ judicial custody on Monday for speaking in favour of Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) in 2009, the Live Mint said.
Vaiko, who has been seeking early disposal of the pending case, surrendered before the court on Monday and refused to apply for bail.
Consequently, the magistrate had to remand judicial custody.
The MDMK leader who had been supporting the cause of Tamil Eelam (independent state for Tamils in Sri Lanka), in a public meeting in 2008, had alleged that the Union government was aiding the Sri Lankan government and warned that India would not remain a single country if the war against LTTE in the neighbouring country was not stopped.
The Chennai police in 2009 booked him for charges including the Section 124 A (sedition) and 13(1)b of the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Amendment Act, 2004.
Tamil Nadu had witnessed widespread protests in 2008-09 during the last phase of Sri Lankan civil war and had asked the Central government to intervene to stop the war in the neighbouring island nation.
