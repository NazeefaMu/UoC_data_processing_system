Lankans fight back to force a draw

Batting prowess of both teams that dominated the ball throughout the match forced a tame draw in the first 4-day Youth-Test between England U19s and Sri Lanka U19s that concluded at FP Fenner's Ground, Cambridge on Friday. England opener, Olly Westbury’s blistering 196 kick-started a run-fest that produced 1017 runs at the expense of just 22 wickets told the story of the batsmen’s dominance in this inaugural Test of the two-match series.
After England decided to take the first lease of the wicket Lahiru Kumara and Sammu Ashan reduced them to 85 for two by the 30th over before opener, Olly Westbury and George Bartlett sharing an enormous 231 stand for the third wicket set the tone for England towards a big first innings total. Bartlett was the third man to go after a well accomplished 152-ball 131 with 13 fours and two sixes.
Then there was another good partnership between Olly and wicket-keeper Ollie Pope for the fifth wicket that saw England go past 450. Olly Westbury who was fashioning England innings with a well-composed marathon innings finally missed out on a well deserving double ton when he was caught at first slip by Avishka Fernando from a slow Damitha Silva delivery for an elegant 196 whilst Pope was out for a patient 78. England U19 declared their first innings with the score at 500 for nine in 131 overs. Two medium-pacers, Jehan Daniel and Lahiru Kumara sharing five wickets took most wickets for Sri Lanka.
Lankans reply innings too started in the same fashion as hosts did losing the wickets of Pathum Nissanka for 5 and Dilan Jayalath for 22. Then there were a few partnerships among skipper Charith Asalanka, Avishka Fernando and Sammu Ashan, but neither of them developed to a height that could match the feats of their England counterparts. Charith and Avishka missed out on two different milestones, former fell 19 runs short of his century whilst latter 5 runs short of his fifty.
However, Shammu somehow managed to complete his fifty but fell soon after. After Ashen Bandara lost his wicket for 21, Jehan Daniel and Damitha Silva added useful 90 runs for the eighth wicket, but Lankans final total of 335 was not sufficient to make England bat again. Amar Virdi Completed a five-for becoming pick of England attack.
Sri Lanka followed on with a first innings deficit of 165 and they wiped out the deficit without much terror and earned a lead of 17 runs with seven wickets remaining before the match came to an end on the final day a few overs before the scheduled close as the match was heading for a an inevitable draw. Dilan Jayalath whose unbeaten 77 and Charith Asalanka’s second half ton in the match with a brisk 70 from just 76 balls including 13 fours headlined in Lankans well-resisted innings after follow on.
England U19 : 500/9 dec. in 131 overs (O E Westbury 196, George Bartlett 131, Ollie Pope 78, Jehan Daniel 3/90, Lahiru Kumara 2/104, Sammu Ashan 1/21)
