Cleanliness matters
At present in Sri Lanka (India as well) people have not realised the importance of having clean toilets (public and private). Several eating houses, restaurants, clubs, theatres do not have proper toilet facilities even for their own employees. Non-communicable diseases such as typhoid, diarrhoea and yellow fever spread fast in the absence of proper toilet facilities.
In a recent survey in India, it was revealed that ladies feel shy to use toilets when they go out to attend functions and even at offices as well, causing health problems which are on the increasing trend. The same situation prevails in Sri Lanka as well.
In countries promoting tourism like Sri Lanka must take special care as regards this matter. Countries like Singapore, Thailand in South East Asia have taken utmost care in this regard. One tourist had made a sarcastic comment “Culture of Indians, Sri Lankans could be revealed when we walk into public toilets.” This is a fact.
Religious places of worship consider it is a sin to have toilets within the sacred area. It is true that more than 95% of the places of worship do not have proper toilet facilities.
Establishments which have female employees must have proper separate toilet facility within 50 yards of the working place (labour law). Further, the additional facilities have to be provided for disabled persons.
It is necessary to develop a culture of clean toilets (paid or unpaid).
