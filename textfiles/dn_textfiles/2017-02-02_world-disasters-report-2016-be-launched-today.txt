World Disasters Report 2016 to be launched today

The World Disasters Report 2016 will be launched today by the Sri Lanka Red Cross Society at a function scheduled to be held at the Lakshman Kadiragamar Institute, Colombo 07 under the patronage of the President of the Sri Lanka Red Cross, Jagath Abeysinghe.
The report which is an annual document which emphasises the disasters that affect communities globally, stresses that a lack of global investment in strengthening community resilience and leaving tens of millions of people exposed to predictable, preventable and catastrophic disaster risks.
According to the report, despite broad recognition that investing in resilience before a disaster, can save lives and money, only 40 cents in every 100 US dollars spent on international aid is invested in preparedness and measures to reduce disaster risk.
