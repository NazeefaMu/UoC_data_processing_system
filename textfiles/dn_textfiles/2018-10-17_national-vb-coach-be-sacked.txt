National VB coach to be sacked

The Sri Lanka Volleyball Federation which conducted the first ever Asia Challenge Cup in Sri Lanka failed to reach the final when they lost the most important match to Saudi Arabia. The result was a very suspicious one for interested parties as such the Federation had to appoint a Special Committee to inquire into the matter in question. The Committee after completing the investigations under the leadership of DIG Priyantha Jayakody submitted its report to the Federation and it was released to the media yesterday. The other members of the Committee were former Secretary Susil Ranasinghe, K.R.D.C. Ratnamudali Chairman Technical Co., Ranjan Premaratne Chairman Selection Com. and Dhanpal Jayapadma Tournament Com. Secretary.
The Committee has found that the defeat was mainly caused due to the negligence of the head coach Dejan Chulicivic, According to the investigations carried out by the Committee it was proved beyond doubt that he has willfully kept off the top players from the game against Saudi Arabia. This has brought down the mentality of the players which resulted in Sri Lanka losing to Saudis and failing to reach the final. After receiving the report the federation has discussed the matter at length and decided to terminate the services of the present coach from December 31 said the Minister of Power and Energy and Renewable Energy and President of SLVBF addressing the press yesterday. Minister adding further said that when the present Committee took steps were to promote the national sport and prepared a four year plan which included to get the services of a foreign coach, to play more international matches, to conduct international tourneys and also to have long term training programs for selected players after the completion of the national championship.
Services of a foreign coach is to be looked for by next January and with this mind have requested the World Governing body’s assistance for same, said the Minister.
