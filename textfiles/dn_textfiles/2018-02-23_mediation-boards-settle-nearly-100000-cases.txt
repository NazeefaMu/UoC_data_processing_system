Mediation boards settle nearly 100,000 cases

The chain of mediation boards set up throughout the country have been able to resolve nearly 100,000 disputes among conflicting parties through negotiations in 2017, without allowing them to have recourse to legal action which is both expensive and time-consuming, informed sources said.
Sources said nearly 36,035,086 disputes had been referred to mediation boards and of them nearly 100,000 disputes had been amicably settled.
A majority of disputes referred to mediation boards were financial disputes and the second largest number of disputes were family disputes. The Chairman of the media boards Commission is former Supreme Court Justice Hector Yapa.
