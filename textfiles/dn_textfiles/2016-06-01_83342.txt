Sri Lanka’s utility cricketer

Ever since the great Muthiah Muralitharan retired from international cricket Rangana Herath is the man the captain had to turn to, especially for his left-arm bowling skills to win matches. But Herath has not confined himself to contributing to his team only by taking wickets but has also proved to be a useful tailend batsman who could be a thorn to any opposition.
England found that out at Durham on Monday, when they were racing towards a series clinching win. They had picked up the sixth wicket with Sri Lanka still trailing behind by 83 runs from avoiding an innings defeat and were looking to clean up the long tail swiftly when they faced unexpected confrontation from Herath.
For the next two hours or so England tried every trick in the book to dislodge him but he was equal to the task sweeping, reverse sweeping and blocking balls to add to the opposition’s frustration.
In the time he spent in the middle with Dinesh Chandimal, Herath raised the total by 116 runs for the seventh wicket and by the time he was dismissed he had made sure that England will have to bat again to achieve victory. Herath’s contribution was a gutsy 61 off 99 balls.
“Rangana has become a proper no. 8 for us over the past one-and-a-half years,” said captain Angelo Mathews complimenting his champion spinner. “He’s been scoring and hanging in there. If I recall a couple of years ago at Headingley he batted with me and got 49. He’s been giving his best with the bat and ball for us over the last couple of years. Every day he’s been trying to get better. Hopefully he can continue that.”
Unfortunately for Herath his plucky effort did not bring the result that his previous two century partnerships had produced, as Sri Lanka ended on the losing side.
On the previous two occasions Herath was involved in rearguard fightbacks he had finished on the winning side – against India at Galle in 2010 and at Headingley in 2014.
The Durham Test also gave Herath his 300th Test wicket, making him only the second bowler in Sri Lanka’s cricket history to attain that figure after Muthiah Muralitharan and Chaminda Vaas.
In conditions that were less conducive to spin bowling Herath had to labour for 29 overs before finally reaching that landmark. Steve Finn the England number 10 became Herath’s victim when he top edged a sweep to him.
Although team members gathered around him to congratulate Herath on his achievement, the circumstances should have been in far better environment than Sri Lanka were placed in. England had by then piled up over 450 runs and the Test seemed as good as gone from Sri Lanka’s grasp. Sri Lanka had to either win or draw to stay alive in the series, but they were neither anywhere close to achieving that.
When Chaminda Vaas took his 300th Test wicket playing in his 90th Test against India at Delhi trapping Gautam Gambhir lbw in 2005, Sri Lanka finished on the losing side by 188 runs.
Muralitharan completed his 300th Test wicket in 58 Tests, the second fastest to the mark after Dennis Lillee who got there in 55. Muralitharan’s 300th victim was Shaun Pollock whom he tempted to drive too early and was caught by Tillakaratne Dilshan for 11. Sri Lanka escaped that rain-hit Test played at Durban with a draw.
Herath is the 30th bowler in Test history to cross the 300-wicket mark.
“When I made my debut in 2009, I hadn’t dreamt of getting to 300 wickets,” said Herath. Before 2009, I was in and out of the team. But for six or seven years now, I’ve been consistently in the side, and have been the first-choice spinner.
I’ve just tried to think about what I need to do for the team. I hadn’t thought about the number of wickets, really.”
With his fitness being an issue Herath was uncertain how long he could carry on as his country’s number one spinner. He took a wise decision to quit from one-day cricket (50 overs and 20-20) to concentrate on Test matches only to prolong his international career.
“When I took 250 wickets, I knew that we had quite a few Tests coming up. With my fitness, I thought that, yes, I should be able to get to 300. But that wasn’t a focus for me. I have to thank my teammates for helping me along the way.”
Reflecting back on the high moments of his career Herath said, “Every bowler will remember his first Test wicket (Ricky Ponting), and that’s the same for me. In addition to that I remember taking nine wickets in an innings against Pakistan.
Also when we won a Test in Durban I took nine wickets that was special. Those are the major memories.”
At 38 Herath is one of the oldest cricketers around in the international circuit today and Sri Lanka will be hoping this utility cricketer would continue to serve them for a longer period of time.
