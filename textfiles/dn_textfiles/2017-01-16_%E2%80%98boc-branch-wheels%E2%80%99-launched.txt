‘BOC Branch on  Wheels’ launched

Bank of Ceylon’s newest value addition to its customers is the “Branch on wheels” which was launched on January 10, with the patronage of the Bank’s Chairman Ronald C. Perera and General Manager, D.M. Gunasekera. Deputy General Manager Sales and Channel Management Senarath Bandara, members of the Corporate and Executive Management.
The mobile branch vehicle includes a teller counter, customer area, ATM, and a self service KIOSK. A wider range of banking services such as cash deposits and withdrawals, fund transfers, bill payments, accounts opening, applying for loans and internet banking is provided here. With the online connectivity the mobile branch has, a transaction that would be done at through this branch would be updated real-time.
BOC Branch on Wheels is introduced in line with the Government objective to bring in the un-bankable population in the country to the banking stream through extending modern banking facilities to customers in remote areas and building their confidence in the banking stream.
Enabled as a part of the digital transformation, the Bank takes this initiative very seriously.
To ensure that the entire country is covered, the Bank will assign a mobile branch for each province. By doing so it will be able to cover wider ground area and reach a wider customer base ranging from a busy marketplace, to a school, hospital and any type of organization or factory, at the convenience of the customer.
The branch will be deployed according to a pre-decided schedule to operate as a routine branch. It will also serve as a service station when mobilizing special events in the region.
BOC also looks forward to strategically place this as a part of a recovery plan to support relief operations in disaster situations to assist customers immediately in their time of need.
