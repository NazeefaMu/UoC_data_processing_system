River water levels deflating; No cause for fear

Foods are subsiding, Irrigation Department Director General M.Thuraisingham said on Sunday.
“If it does not rain today and tomorrow, I can say that the situation returns to normal,” he said.
“The water level of Kalu Ganga is currently receding. It has already deflated to a minor flood level,”he said.
“The flood-hit areas are on the way to recovery,” he said.
“There were reports that the water level of Polgolla was rising, but it is not so. Actually, the level has decreased and is at three feet,” he pointed out.
“There is no need for fear for the people in Panadura that floods will attack their areas through an opening or some possible wreckage of a sluice gate which is holding water from Kalutara,” he said.
“Our Irrigation Department workers have taken care of the sluice gate leak which they said has posed a flood threat in Panadura,” he said.
“The workers have arrested the leakage,” he confirmed.
“The water level of Gin Ganga has also deflated. The bund leak in Galle related to the river too has been arrested by laying sand bags with the help of the soldiers of the Sri Lanka Army,” he said.
“The leakage found in bunds is a minor matter. We ask the public not to have any fears over their being broken,” he appealed.
“The water level in Nilwala River has also subsided. The situation is returning normal,” he added.
