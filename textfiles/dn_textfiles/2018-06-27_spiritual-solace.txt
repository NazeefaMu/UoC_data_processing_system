Spiritual Solace

Home to a large number of meditating monks, Veherayaya Purana Rajamaha Viharaya is perched in peaceful and quiet Galawewa about 5 km to 17 Junction on Colombo-Vavuniya Road. The meditating monks are attracted to the place because of its isolation and seclusion.
Veherayaya Rajamaha Viharaya is surrounded by paddy-fields and sesame fields. The narrow path between the fields immediately transports us into a world of its own. This is indeed a timeless retreat, engulfed by the essence of tranquillity and inner peace.
As we enter the sacred premises, we are instantly enclosed by a certain spiritual composure. The birdsong intermingles with the rustling of leaves in the trees and the movements of the monks engaged in their evening chores. All this culminated we are drawn into the profound peacefulness of the Veherayaya temple.
The golden standing Buddha statue, pure white stupa and the sacred Bo Tree enhance the placidity of the surrounding.
According to Veherayaya Purana Rajamaha Viharaya Chief Incumbent Venerable Palugama Nimalananda Thera, the site is blessed with a vibrant history dating back to the times of King Agbo I. He ruled the kingdom of Anuradhapura between 575 and 608 AC. An ancient pond and the stone pillars are the main evidence to prove that. It was completely destroyed before it was fully restored 30 years ago.
Plans are afoot to establish a Buddhist meditation-centre and a convalescent centre for providing accommodation and treatment for members of the Maha Sangha - the aged and the desolate, in particular.
“The practice of Buddhist meditation such as Samatha and Vipassana to a great extent will help cultivate a developed mind. A peaceful mind is a key to happiness. It helps lead a peaceful life. Finally, the people with the peaceful mind will make a peaceful society,” Venerable Nimalananda Thera maintains.
The Venerable Thera is trying his level best to keep the temple environs alcohol-free. The five precepts which encourage abstaining from taking life, taking what is not given, engaging in sexual misconduct, false speech and intoxicants are the moral pillars of any Buddhist. The practice of the Buddhist moral precepts has a profound impact on one’s personal and social life.
“Observing the five precepts help promote peaceful coexistence, mutual trust and understanding as well as the general peace and reconciliation in society. It will also help achieve social progress and development,” the Venerable Thera says.
He does not claim any ownership of the temple. Yet, he wants to develop the temple and convert it into a resourceful place that nourishes the Buddha Sasana.
“According to the Buddha’s teaching, the Buddhist monks should be detached from everything worldly,” the Venerable Thera adds, “and that includes the very temples we dwell in.”
