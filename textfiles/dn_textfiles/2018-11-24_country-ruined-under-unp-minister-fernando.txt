Country ruined under UNP: Minister Fernando

The country would have been ruined if the UNP was in power for another year, said Co-operatives Minister Johnston Fernando.
He was speaking at a meeting of voters in the Divulapitiya electorate at Marandagahamula, yesterday.
“The economy has collapsed due to the plundering of public funds at the Central Bank under UNP leadership,” he said. “I was kept in remand custody for 44 and 29 days respectively to take revenge from me. All family members of Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa were meaninglessly harassed by putting them in jail during the past several years. Several ministers, parliamentarians and members of the Buddhist clergy were kept in remand custody to take political revenge,” the minister said.
If the appointment of Mahinda Rajapaksa as Prime Minister is unlawful, UNP leader Ranil Wickremesinghe should file a case in the Supreme Court against that decision.
He never did that as he knows that the appointments by the President are lawful and in accordance with the Constitution, Minister Fernando said.
“If the UNP is confident that they have the will of the people to rule the country, why do the leaders of the UNP fear General Elections? The UNP has been postponing elections for years depriving the rights of voters. Therefore, the UNP is not a democratic political party.”
“The only available solution to the present political situation is to hold General Elections soon to allow people to elect their people’s representatives,” said the minister.
