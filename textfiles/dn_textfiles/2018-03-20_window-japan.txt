Window to Japan

Japanese TV programs dubbed in Tamil commenced telecasting on February 20 on the Reconciliation Channel (Nethra TV). These TV programs from Japan include documentaries on Japanese industry, technology, economy, nature, science and environment as well as educational programs for children.
The programs are being dubbed into Sinhala and Tamil, so that they could be easily understood by all communities in Sri Lanka. (The Sinhala version of those TV programs will start telecasting later on a different Rupavahini channel, which is yet to be announced.)
The Japanese Government granted 449 TV programs, worth of 52.6 million Japanese Yen to Sri Lanka Rupavahini Corporation in order to enhance awareness of Japanese culture, value and lifestyle among Sri Lankan viewers nation- wide.
Japanese Government also granted Rs. 42.7 million to cover part of the cost for dubbing Japanese programs into Sinhalese and Tamil, producing of trailers and crawlers as well as allocating airtime for them.
The Japanese Embassy in Sri Lanka hopes that these programs would promote the understanding about Japan among Sri Lankan people and thereby contribute to deepening the ties between Japan and Sri Lanka.
