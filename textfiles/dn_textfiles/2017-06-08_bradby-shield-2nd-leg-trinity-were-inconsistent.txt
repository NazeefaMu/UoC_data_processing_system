Bradby Shield 2nd leg: Trinity were inconsistent

Royal adopted a well-constructed team effort, helped by some superb defensive work that saw the newly crowned league Cup champions claim their most valued prize the coveted Bradby Shield in the second leg worked off at the Royal Complex.
The host team came into the 2nd leg with a five-point lead and showcased a fine team performance to hold the dangerous Trinitians at bay to claim the shield for the 3rd consecutive year with an aggregate score of 35-25.
The league champs however, were the better team on the day adapting to the conditions using their big forwards in close range with “pick and goes”, which helped Royal earn a few penalties, which they decided to kick to touch and set up their piece-de-resistance, the rolling maul. Trinity however, having done their homework, succeeded in repelling the hosts attacks time and again.
Trinity were disappointed with the final result (13-8) as they had high hopes and expectations, But it went to show that they failed to click as a team although they had all the resources and ability, Probably it attributes to poor leadership, inconsistency in executing the game plan or counter attacking the opponents strategy with a drive to win. Credit to Royal.
Trinity in this game backed one error up with another. Royal won the loose mauls; they went for the driving maul. They found space; they spoiled everything by frustrating their opponents excellently. Royal started the second half well, looking calm and controlled, and were the superior team in that half, and had far more possession and territorial advantage.
Trinity had a lot to sort out, from poor line outs, scrums and were ineffective in the loose. They had some good attacking players, but in this game they were all inconsistent in attacking and defending.
It was a very enjoyable game of rugby to watch with both sides competing well from start to finish but one in which Royal were always on top.
