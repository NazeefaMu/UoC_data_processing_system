Tissamaharama cattle die without fodder

Cattle herd owners in the Tissamaharama Divisional Secretariat area said that about 10 cattle die almost daily due to lack of fodder and water.
They request the government to set up grazing land for the benefit of the cattle. They said the grazing land allocated at Amarawewa several years ago should be developed to provide fodder for cattle.
They said their cattle also die as a result of trap guns laid by hunters for wild beasts when the cattle roam in jungles in search of fodder.
