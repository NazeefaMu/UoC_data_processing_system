Hathurusingha says B'desh knowledge helped team

SYLHET, Saturday - Sri Lankan coach Chandika Hathurusingha said on Saturday his inside knowledge of Bangladesh helped his side come out on top in all three new formats.
Hathurusingha coached Bangladesh for more than three years before he quit in October to join his struggling home team. He faced his former charges in his very first series as Sri Lankan coach, guiding the visiting side to success in all three formats of the game so far.
Sri Lanka started the tri-nation one-day international tournament in January poorly, losing their first two matches to Zimbabwe and Bangladesh respectively before they came back strongly to reach the final.
They won the final comfortably by 79-runs and then dominated the hosts in a two Test series, winning it 1-0 in earlier this month. Sri Lanka also won Thursday's first Twenty20 international, overcoming Bangladesh’s record score of 193-5 with relative ease to take a 1-0 lead in the two match series. The win in the first Twenty20 international also snapped Sri Lanka's eight-match losing streak, spanning nearly a year.
“I think yes, to be honest,” Hathurusingha said when asked if his Bangladesh knowledge had made the difference.
“We had some strategic plans for some of the players. We knew how they would react under pressure,” he said. Hathurusingha added: “All in all, it was a satisfying tour for me personally.” – AFP
