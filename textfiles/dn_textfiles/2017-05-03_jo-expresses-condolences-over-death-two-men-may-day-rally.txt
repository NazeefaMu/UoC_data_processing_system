JO expresses condolences over death of two men at May Day rally

Joint Opposition member Udaya Gammanpila yesterday expressed their condolences on the death of two persons during their May Day rally at Galle Face, Colombo.
Colombo National Hospital sources said the persons, a 68-year-old man from Kandy and another 65-year-old man, possibly succumbed to complications from heat.
“We are deeply saddened by their death,” said Gammanpila, "They had come to attend our May Day rally despite their old age and disabilities.” “They did not just die. They came to a rally that was organised to protect the motherland, workplace and the rice fields of the country,” he said, "therefore, we believe they sacrificed their lives to the motherland,” he said.
