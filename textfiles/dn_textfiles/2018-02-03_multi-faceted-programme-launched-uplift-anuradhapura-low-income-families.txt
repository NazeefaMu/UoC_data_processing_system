Multi-faceted programme launched to uplift Anuradhapura low-income families

The Mahaweli Development and Environment Ministry has initiated a programme to provide food items, potable drinking water and livelihood assistance for low income families in the Anuradhapura district.
Poor people in Anuradhapura, Polonnaruwa, Kurunegala, Puttlam, Trincomalee, Vavuniya and Mannar will benefit from the programme.
It will cost $55 million and of them, $39 million will be donated by the Green Climate Fund through the UNDP.
Steps will be taken to rehabilitate 325 tanks and 30 tank cascade systems. Mee Oya, Yan Oya and the Malwathuoya river basins will be rehabilitated to contain water for dry season.
Thirty five community based water projects, 125 reverse osmosis (RO) water filtering plants and 4000 rain water harvesting tank systems are planned to be installed as well.
