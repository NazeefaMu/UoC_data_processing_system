Beruwala abandoned boats turn mosquito breeding grounds

Nearly 34 boats lying abandoned in and around the Beruwala Fisheries Harbour have become breeding grounds of dengue mosquitoes. Destruction of these boats has become a problem to health authorities as some boats have been retained as Court productions in human smuggling cases and others have been retained for defaulting bank loan installment payments.
Water gathers in boats as they are left open to the elements. Health authorities said they have planned to shift boats to a single point and fumigate them.
