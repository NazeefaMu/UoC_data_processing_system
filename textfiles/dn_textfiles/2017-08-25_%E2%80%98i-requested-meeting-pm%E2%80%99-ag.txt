‘I requested meeting with PM’ - AG

Attorney General Jayantha Jayasuriya PC yesterday refuted media speculation and comments made by the former Justice Minister that his department was taken to task during a meeting with Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe recently.
“In fact it is I who requested a meeting with the Prime Minister. During the meeting which took place at ‘Temple Trees’ nothing which undermines the respect and integrity of the Attorney General’s Department happened, he added.
Jayasuriya noted the above when inquired about the comments made by outgoing Justice Minister Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe on Wednesday that the AG’s department had been castigated over several issues during the meeting with the Premier.
The Attorney General described the meeting with the Premier as very cordial and added that speculation his department had been dishonoured was completely false and baseless.
