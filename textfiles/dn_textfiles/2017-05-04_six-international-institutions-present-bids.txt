Six international institutions present bids

Logistic support vehicles for Army peacekeeping contingent in Mali:
Six international institutions have presented bids to supply military logistic support vehicles required by the Sri Lankan Army peacekeeping contingent in Mali.
President Maithripala Sirisena in his capacity as Defence Minister sought Cabinet approval to award the bid to the institution recommended by the Standing Cabinet Appointed Procurement Committee.
The lack of equipment has been an issue which has plagued the Sri Lankan peacekeepers ever since they received the mission in 2016. At the time, it was reported that the UN had to cut down on the number sent from Sri Lanka due to a lack of adequate equipment. The Sri Lankan Army however denied such reports and reiterated that they would be sending troops in batches.
In November 2016, Cabinet approval was sought to award the contract to supply demining and explosive disposal equipment to a party chosen by the Standing Cabinet Appointed Procurement Committee.
Earlier this year, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe received Cabinet approval to enter into a loan agreement with the Russian Bank SBERBANK to fund the purchasing of equipment required by the troops.
