D.B. Welagedara: Humble hero

D.B. Welagedara is a name that dwells in the hearts of the people of Kurunegala. That is because of the memorable services he has rendered to them during a period spanning a half century.
It is 28 years since his demise. The D.B. Welagedara Commemorative Society will meet today, at 8.30 a.m., at the Welagedara memorial on Colombo Road, Kurunegala to revere his memory. This year too, as usual, there will be almsgiving, other meritorious activities and donations of spectacles and equipment to facilitate the mobility of the handicapped. The award of D.B. Welagedara scholarships too, will take place at the time.
D.B. Welagedara was born on October 31, 1915, at Panaliya, Polgahawela, as the only son in a renowned family of the area.
He had his education at Ananda and Nalanda Colleges in Colombo and at St. John's College in Jaffna. He then joined the Law College of Sri Lanka to his law studies, and at the end of his studies, he joined the administration of the country as a Divisional Revenue Officer, a member of the first batch of such officers who replaced the Rate Mahathmayas who were holding office at the time. He was elected the president of the Divisional Revenue Officers' Association.
He was outstanding in rendering service to the rural people. At their insistence, he resigned from the public service, sacrificing his pension to contest the snap general election of 1952. He was elected the MP for Kurunegala, defeating no less a person than Queens Counsel H. Sri Nissanka, stalwart in the political arena.
Welagedara was dedicated to serving the public as Mayor, Member of Parliament, Deputy Minister, Cabinet Minister, and Provincial Governor, right to the day he passed away. His services in this regards was mainly in the fields of education, health, transport, agriculture, and religion, but not restricted to them.
He was exemplary in his conduct and was a model to be emulated.
His most outstanding quality was his punctuality. Once having accepted an invitation to be the chief guest of a school ceremony, he visited the school at the exact time indicated to find that the ceremony would not start after delay. In case of delay, in resentment, he left the school after advising the principal to train schoolchildren to work on time. He was keen to follow to the letter the Buddhist way of living. His position was that he did not need any additional protection as he was protected by the Triple Gem. He functioned as the Secretary of the Mahiyangana Chaithya Renovation Society, when Prime Minister D.S. Senanayake was the chairman of that society, followed by his son, Dudley Senanayake.
His last request reflects his Buddhist traditional values. It was as follows:
“Request made to my relatives and friends:
Death, just as birth, is common to all beings, including myself. It cannot be avoided. No purpose will be served by grieving.
My eyes should be used to provide vision to a person who could make use of them.
My body should be given over to a hospital or research institution that could make use of it for the benefit of others.
If I have done any wrong to you, bury its memory forever."
(The remains of Welagedara were handed over to the Sri Lanka Medical College, whilst the eyes were handed over to the Eye Donation Society of Sri Lanka). King Dutugemunu who vanquished king Elara, had much respect for the latter. He ordained that any person passing by the tomb of Elara, should pay homage to his memorial. Welagedara too, had these inimitable virtues. He named a school started by him as H. Sri Nissanka Vidyalaya, being the name of a political rival. The inaugural entry in the log book of the Maliyadeva Model School, a school that Piyadasa Wijesinghe planned to start and effectively completed by Welagedara, is an order by him that Piydasa Wijesinghe should be invited for all ceremonies of the school. These examples illustrate his qualities.
Welagedara took pride in his being a Sinhala and a villager. He believed that if any person remembers the Buddha first and noble Sinhala kings like Parakramabahu and Dutugemunu. That person refrains from adopting the wicked practices of the foreigners. He is bound to prosper. His practices reflected this philosophy. He moved in regal circles, but never forgot his rural background nor did he forsake his bond with the common man.
All his efforts were directed at making a
bath korale (a rice bowl) out of Sath Korale. He was an experienced farmer too. His example induced others to take to cultivation. A tree planting campaign was an indispensable item in any birthday celebration for him. His policy was that a tree should be planted for every tree uprooted.
His adorable qualities are the gifts he left to us on taking leave of us.
May D.B. Welagedara attain supreme bliss of Nibbana!
