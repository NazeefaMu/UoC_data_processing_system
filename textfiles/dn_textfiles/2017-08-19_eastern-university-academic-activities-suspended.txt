Eastern University academic activities suspended

Academic activities at the Eastern University other than the Trincomalee Campus have been suspended from Thursday onwards and all students were asked to vacate their hostels before 12 noon on Friday due to the prevailing tense situation over the last few days, Vice Chancellor Dr. T. Jayasingam said.
All academic and administrative activities of the University came to a standstill after students surrounded the Administrative Block demanding that hostel facilities be provided to them from August 8.
Owing to the deteriorating situation, the University Council decided to suspend all academic activities of all Faculties except the Trincomalee Campus.
Meanwhile, University Administration has filed a case at the Batticaloa Courts against the students involved in these activities.
