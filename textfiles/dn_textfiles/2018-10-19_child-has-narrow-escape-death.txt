Child has narrow escape from death

A two-year-old sustained minor injuries when a backhoe crashed into a house on Wednesday.
The incident took place at Vidapola, Handugala, when a backhoe veered off the road and toppled onto a house in a low-lying land.
The child had been admitted to the Walasmulla Hospital after a youth had found him lying under a window frame that was stuck six inches above him. Walasmulla Police are investigating.
