Retail market activities of CSE improves

A senior investment advisor attached to the Sampath Securities said that retail market activities in the Colombo Stock Exchange showed signs of improvement yesterday.
This is with the current uncertain situation in some parts of the country retuning to normalcy. The recent sectarian violence, took place in some parts of the island over the last two –three days had a profound impact on movement of the stock exchange activities, especially net- foreign purchases particularly on Tuesday and Wednesday.
Turnover dropped notably as volume also declined while a low foreign participation led to a meagre net foreign inflow into the market while All Share Price Index had a downward trend during the same period.
Meanwhile First Capital in their market review said that the secondary market yield curve remained mostly unchanged at previous day’s levels following yesterday’s (8) primary bill auction. Market witnessed similar outcome as yesterday with activity levels continue to dry up amidst market participants continuing to remain on the sideline awaiting clarity on prevailing uncertainty in the country.
