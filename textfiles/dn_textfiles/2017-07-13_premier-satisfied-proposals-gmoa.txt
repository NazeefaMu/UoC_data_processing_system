The Prime Minister has responded positively to a set of proposals presented to the Government by the Government Medical Officers' Association (GMOA), the Deans of all State Medical Faculties of Sri Lanka and the Faculty of Medicine Teachers' Associations (FMTAs), GMOA Secretary Haritha Aluthge said.
 Addressing a press conference held at the GMOA Head Quarters in Colombo he said today that the Prime Minister gave instructions to Health Minister Rajitha Senaratne in connection with continuing discussions based on the set of proposals presented by the GMOA and other two organizations.
According to Dr. Aluthge, all parties came to an agreement in connection with solving the issue of Sri Lanka Medical Council (SLMC) President's appointment with the consent of all parties, completing the work on proposed Minimum Standards of Medical Education as soon as possible by coordinating with the Legal Draftsman's Department and identifying ways to solve the SAITM issue with the directions of the SLMC during pending court cases.
All efforts made by all parties to make SAITM a public property will be taken without any interruption and the proposed massive summit organized by Anti SAITM People's Barricade will be held in Colombo on July 20 as planned without any change, he added.
