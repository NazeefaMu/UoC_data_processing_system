IAAF World Championships Day 4 highlights

LONDON: Day four highlights for the IAAF World Championships on Monday:
Men's 110m hurdles final
Aries Merritt could provide the fairytale that the championships need after Justin Gatlin denied Usain Bolt his golden farewell in the 100m.
The 31-year-old American safely negotiated the two rounds on Sunday and is one outstanding performance away from repeating his Olympic winning feat on the same track in 2012 and just two years after a kidney transplant.
Slightly alarming for him was he felt his hamstring prior to the semi-final. His biggest threat will be Jamaica's Olympic champion Omar McLeod who looked to be in ominously good shape and is determined to break Merritt's world record in the final.
