CDS relocates operations to Rajagiriya

In a move aimed at supporting the expansion planned for the organization going forward, Central Depository Systems (Pvt) Ltd (CDS), a fully owned subsidiary of the Colombo Stock Exchange (CSE), relocated its operations to a larger premises located at the Ground Floor of the M and M Centre, Rajagiriya.
While the new address will be used for correspondence, all other details including the Company's website (www.cds.lk), and other contacts remain unchanged. The change of address will not have an impact on any policies or procedures presently maintained by the CDS.
The expansion drive is focused on pursuing a new phase of innovation by the CDS and aims to surpass the initial objectives of streamlining the clearing and settlement of transactions taking place on the CSE and safekeeping of securities on behalf of domestic and international investors. Through the expansion, the CDS intends toenhance the services offered to all stakeholders and to encourage investors to take an active role in the management of their investment portfolios. The relocation is set to support the CDS to further strengthen its depository infrastructure and to diversify operations into selective value-added business ventures.
A number of technology driven value added services including a range of online services for CDS account holders through the CDS e-connect portal, SMS alerts and eStatements have already been introduced.
