Justice Ministry receiving many complaints over JPs’ misconduct: Additional Secretary

The Justice Ministry every year receives a large number of complaints on JPs' misconduct. Charging money for services is one, Justice Ministry Additional Secretary Sunil Samaraweera said.
According to Samaraweera, some JPs come to Colombo and loiter around the court complex.
"Some others travel in three-wheelers and charge money for their services from the public. JPs are volunteers and should not do any of these things," he said. JPs should certify relatives' documents and not sign documents outside their assigned areas. They should not display the sign of the state opposite their homes, on their rubber stamp or anywhere else. They should resign from the service if they do not carry out their duties properly, Samaraweera said.
Justice Minister Coordinating Secretary Dasun Nagassena said an inspection will be carried out on the conduct of JPs to make sure that they do their job properly and serve the people as expected by the state. The system is already in place at district level, he said.
