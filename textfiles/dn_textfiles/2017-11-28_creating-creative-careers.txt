Creating creative careers

From the early ages to the modern civilizations of today, fashion has played a major role in sculpting societies. Sri Lanka’s fashion industries have risen to cater the international markets at large scale. Thus, resulted a high demand for fashion designers, and the requirement hasn’t been met.
Creativity plays a rigorous role in convincing customers to part of a fashion brand. People today are engaging with fashion brands that have proven to be Creative. Chanel, Versace, Ralph Lauren, Prada, Victoria Secrets, Louis Vuitton, Burberry, and Dior are just a few examples of world-famous creative fashion brands. It has become important if not compulsory, that ambitious fashion designers learn the art of being creative in order to keep up with the fast-paced world of fashion.
Taught by experienced artists with international industry experience, since 2005, AMDT (Academy of Multimedia Design & Technology) has inspired countless young talents to create successful creative careers over the past 12 years.
The AMDT faculty who know the ‘magic’ behind world-class designer’s work, prove to be uniquely insightful and inspirational. They bring a wealth of experience working in the industry that spreads on the students, keeps them up-to-date in terms of technologies, strategies and brings the skill of forecasting trends to the table.
The students are exposed to ‘Industry collaborated projects’ that further expands their thinking, teamwork skills giving them a first-hand experience on how the industry works. The various fashion related events conducted around the academic year further builds up their leadership and time-management skills bringing in a sense of an engaging ‘workshop’ exposure that’s necessary to make them ready for a Creative career.
The prestigious UK Fashion qualification is recognized by universities and companies worldwide. It’s awarded by UK’s most prestigious Pearson BTEC. The students can apply for memberships of the Chartered Society of Designers and the Society of Dyers and Colourists in the UK and progress as professionals. The UK Fashion qualification creates endless opportunities for students to transfer to the final year of an undergraduate degree in UK, Australia, etc.
In keeping with the original vision, AMDT is determined to make the study of Creative arts accessible to all Sri Lankans, breaking many of the entry barriers that existed before. AMDT is keen to design an identity for Sri Lanka and inspire the next generation of ‘Artrepreneurs’ who will drive the country forward by boldly creating Creative careers.
Apart from fashion, students also have the options of choosing Interactive Multimedia, Visual Communication (Graphic Design), Photography, 3D Animation & Visual Effects (VFX), Advertising & Marketing, and Filmmaking. The January 2018 enrollments are now open and a student requires two A Level passes or O Level with the AMDT Foundation Diploma or any other recognized qualifications. Alternatively, students may also apply with work experience and portfolio.
Students may study the UK Fashion Qualifications either part-time or full-time.
