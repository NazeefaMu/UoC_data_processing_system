EU and ILO help develop skills among youth in Mannar

 Creating job opportunities for young people and promoting 'productive employment and decent work' are important elements in the International Labour Organization’s (ILO) mandate.
As a former conflict-affected region, Mannar is now moving towards rehabilitation and sustainable development where human capacity development plays a key role in reaching the goals set by the government of Sri Lanka.
As a step to achieving this goal, the European Union Support to District Development Programme (EU-SDDP) with a total financial envelope of Rs. 8.8 billion aims at supporting the thrust of the Government of Sri Lanka towards economic and social development in seven conflict-affected districts.
In Mannar District, the ILO joined hands with Technical College, Mannar, to improve access to relevant and quality skills training in the district.
Mannar was identified as having high growth in construction due to the post-conflict resettlement process of displaced families, infrastructure development and rehabilitation of community structures. The ILO, through the EU-SDDP support, initially supported the Mannar Technical College with equipment worth Rs. 4.70 million to conduct courses on construction related trades.
The first course helped to graduate 54 youth on construction site supervision. Another Rs. 3.9 million worth of equipment will be provided for motorcycle and scooter training.
The official handing over of training equipment under EU-SDDP took place at Mannar Technical College on August 30 with participation of the European Union Delegation to Sri Lanka and the Maldives Head of Cooperation Libuse Soukupova, Department of Technical Education and Training (DTET) Deputy Director, Academics P. M. C. N. Balasooriya and Mannar Government Agent M.Y. S. Deshapriya.
During the event, the graduates of construction site supervision course received their certificates of successful completion of the training. EU-SDDP has aimed at contributing to the transition from post-conflict relief to reconstruction and development by supporting selected districts in the North and East as focus districts in line with respective local development plans.

Under the 'local economic development' component of the programme, ILO undertakes a comprehensive and integrated approach to enable young women and men to make a smooth transition to work through skills training. ILO has partnered with vocational training institutes in the district of Mannar to conduct quality skills training based on labour market demand.
Under those agreements 320 youth received skills training in nine selected high demand trades, namely, plumbing, electrical, welding, heavy equipment operating, modern dress making, automobile repairing, hospitality trades, ICT and construction related trades at selected training centres.
The trained youth are linked with District Public Employment Services (PES) Centres also established under EU-SDDP for employment placement.
EU-SDDP also supports and aims to achieve the one million jobs for the youth initiative of the present Government through enhancing market oriented vocational training.
