UK inflation rate rises to 3.1%

Inflation rose to 3.1% in November, the highest in nearly six years, as the squeeze on households continued.
The Office for National Statistics (ONS) said that airfares and computer games contributed to the increase.
The most recent data shows that average weekly wages are growing at just 2.2%.
Mark Carney, the governor of the Bank of England, will now have to write a letter to Chancellor Philip Hammond explaining how the Bank intends to bring inflation back to its 2% target.
Carney has to write a letter to the chancellor if the Consumer Prices Index (CPI) inflation rate is above 3% or below 1%.
In November, the Bank of England raised its key interest rate for the first time in more than a decade from 0.25% to 0.5%.
However, it is not expected to announce a further increase when it publishes the results of the Monetary Policy Committee’s two-day meeting on Thursday.
Carney had said that he expected inflation to peak in October or November.
The last time he wrote to the chancellor was in December 2016, after inflation fell to 0.9% in October that year.
His latest letter will be published in February, when the Bank of England will also release its quarterly Inflation Report.
Lucy O’Carroll, chief economist at Aberdeen Standard Investments, said: “It’s quite possible that inflation is now close to its peak. But some of the latest surveys suggest that service sector costs and prices are rising. Given how dominant services are in the economy, this could feed through to inflation overall.
“That means that further interest rate rises are definitely not off the table.”
The ONS said that although airfares fell in November - down 10.4% - the decline was not as steep as last year when they tumbled 13.4%.
Data also shows that food inflation has picked up, especially prices for fish, oil and fats, such as butter and chocolate.
Richard Lim, chief executive at Retail Economics, said that the rise in inflation had come “at precisely the wrong time for retailers”.
“In the run-up to Christmas, the cost of living, now rising at the fastest rate in five years, remains uncomfortably high for households.”
