Goad now in our hands: Dilan

We have taken the elephant goad into our hands, SLFP Media Spokesperson Dilan Perera said yesterday, as he insisted that they would not be silent partners in the unity government.
“We are with the government, just because there are problems,
we cannot let the goad go. When there is something bad we criticise and if there is something good, we appreciate that,”,Perera said. He was speaking at a media conference at the SLFP headquarters yesterday.
The state minister also took the opportunity to hit out at members of the Joint Opposition who criticised the SLFP members within the government for having no control. “Earlier they said we did nothing inside the unity government and that the elephant had run riot. But now the goad is in our hands; it is with the President and now they say that the President is controlling everything,” he said.
“And it is because we have the goad that we did not allow lottery ticket prices to be increased, for Hambantota to be sold, for local government elections to be held under the old system and we will not let the perpetrators of the bond scam go”, added the state minister. The Joint Opposition in the meantime will hold its anti-government rally today (27) and while the former President, Mahinda Rajapaksa is expected to attend, he has asked that the other SLFP ministers refrain from attending it. “We have not been invited but they are all SLFP members and they are free to have such rallies. They have been having such rallies throughout but that has not had an impact on the government,” Perera said.
