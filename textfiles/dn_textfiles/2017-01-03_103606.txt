A mockery of laws and hypocrisy

We read in the newspapers about the judgement of the Avissawella High Court Judge Devika Abeyratne who courageously sentenced 18 people to death for the brutal and gruesome murder of Nihal Perera, Superintendent, Noori Estate for standing up to these murderers on November 27, 2016.
One wonders how this sentence can be carried out when this Yahapalayana Government has not implemented the Death Penalty. What a mockery of the laws and what hypocrisy!
There are murders galore in this Buddhist country of ours, with corrupt politicians, child rapists and murderers, heroin dealers and addicts and the government which talks of good governance have not implemented the required laws to curb this. This is why our country has been labeled a NATO country – No Action Talk Only!
When are the peace loving citizens in the country going to get this proper Governance? Certainly not from this Government it seems.
