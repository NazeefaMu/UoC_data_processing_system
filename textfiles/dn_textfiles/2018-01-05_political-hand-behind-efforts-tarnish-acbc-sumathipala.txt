Political hand behind efforts to tarnish ACBC - Sumathipala

There is a political hand behind the efforts made to tarnish the image of the All Ceylon Buddhist Congress (ACBC), ACBC President Jagath Sumathipla said.
"The ACBC has not been involved in politics, but certain elements at present are trying to do politics in the ACBC," Sumathipla said.
Addressing a press conference in Colombo yesterday, he said that there are efforts being made by a politically influenced group to gain a foothold in the ACBC.
"This group is alleged to have direct contacts with Non Governmental Organisations (NGO) working hard to destroy Buddhism, our ancient culture and the Sinhala people," Sumathipla said.
"We are sincerely dedicated to protecting the Buddha Sasana," he added.
According to the ACBC President, the proposed new Constitution should contain the word Buddha Sasana which includes everything, especially all relevant Acts and Ordinances.
"Article 9 of the current Constitution should be included in the new Constitution without any change," he said.
"Everything should be done with the consent of Maha Nayaka Theras. The existance of the ACBC has become an issue for some NGOs," Sumathipla said.
Sumathipala pointed out that the ACBC owns a number of lands and properties. It runs 25 Elders' Homes and Childrens' Homes. More people are donating lands to the ACBC because of the trust and confidence they have placed in it. Annually, the ACBC declares its assets and everything is being done in a transparent manner.
"I plan to contest for the ACBC election to be held dring the 91st Annual General Meeting which is scheduled to be held on January 6 in order to protect the ACBC from harmful elements," Sumathipala said.
"I held the post of ACBC President from 2006 to 2014," he added.
The ACBC office-bearers were also present at the press conference.
