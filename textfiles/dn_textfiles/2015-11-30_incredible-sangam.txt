Incredible SANGAM

India can well speak of an age-old cultural tradition. Their culture has evolved centuries. That was well proven recently at Nelum Pokuna Theatre when Indian High Commission and Cultural Affairs Ministry jointly presented Sangam, Festival of India.
What unfolded at the Nelum Pokuna was the first in the series of events held to celebrate the cultural liaison between Sri Lanka and India. Termed as 'Nrityarupa,' the festival offered a mosaic of Indian dance forms.
Nrityarupa was a collective effort of Sangeet Natak Akademi, India's National Academy of Music, Dance, and Drama. Six dance forms, which stand for India's cultural diversity, had been specially chosen for the festival: Bharatanatyam from southern India, Kathak, previously the dance form of the north, Odissi, from Odisha in eastern India, Manipuri from the north-eastern state of Manipur, Kathakali from Kerala at the southern tip of the Indian peninsula, and Chhau covering a wide area of India's eastern states.
Former President Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga handed awards of merit to the artistes of the performance. Indian High Commissioner Y K Sinha accompanied the former President to hand over the awards. A number of diplomats also graced the occasion.
Other events for Festival of India include the participation of Indian authors and a performance by singer Sonam Kalra and her brainchild, Sonam Kalra and the Sufi Gospel Project, at the Galle Literary Festival in January 2016.
A musical performance will also be held in January 2016 to celebrate the Republic Day of India. Two exhibitions, 'Digital India' and 'Cricket Connects' will be held in February 2016. (SM)
