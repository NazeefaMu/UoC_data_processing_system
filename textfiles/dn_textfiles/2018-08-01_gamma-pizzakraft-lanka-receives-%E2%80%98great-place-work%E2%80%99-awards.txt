Gamma Pizzakraft Lanka receives ‘Great Place to Work’ Awards

Gamma Pizzakraft Lanka (Pvt.) Ltd, currently the sole franchisee for Pizza Hut and Taco Bell in Sri Lanka, was awarded for the fifth time, the title of ‘one of the top 25 best companies to work for in Sri Lanka for the year 2018’.
The company also walked away with the Gold Award for ‘Best in Large Sized Enterprise’ for the third consecutive time at the event held at The Hilton Colombo.
Kaushal Mendis, Director of Human Resources and Administration said, “A company without a motivated and satisfied workforce will never fulfill its grand purpose, and will never realize its potential. I firmly believe that lifting the spirits of a workforce and keeping everyone motivated will give employees the maximum incentive to drive the company to its goals. Showing your workforce care ensures that they will care about the company too.”
CEO of Gamma Pizzakraft Lanka (Pvt.) Ltd, Yasa Nadaraja said, “I am honoured and proud at the prospect of our company being placed yet again among the ‘top 25 greatest places to work’ in the country. Your company is only as good as the people who work in them, and I strongly believe that Gamma Pizzakraft Lanka has an amazing and dedicated workforce committed to ensuring the success of the company. While there is always room for improvement, I have firm belief in the capable hands of our employees.”
Gamma Pizzakraft Lanka (Pvt.) Ltd. treats teamwork as a vital ingredient of their formula for success. Accordingly, their strategy revolves around implementing systems for teams as opposed to individuals.
That however, does not mean an employee’s needs as an individual are not catered for. With development programmes available for each employee, it is encouraged by the organization that every member of staff does their level best in a happy and safe working environment. This gives the employees a true feeling of empowerment thus emboldens them to climb the corporate ladder and work even better in the time to come.
