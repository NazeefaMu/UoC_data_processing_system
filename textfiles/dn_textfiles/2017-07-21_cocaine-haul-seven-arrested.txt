Cocaine haul: Seven arrested

Seven suspects have been arrested by the Mount Lavinia Police in connection with the discovery of 218 kilogrammes of cocaine concealed in a container truck transporting a consignment of sugar to the Ratmalana Economic Center on Tuesday.
“The seized cocaine is said to be worth over Rs.3.2 Billion making it the largest haul of cocaine nabbed within the year,” Police Spokesperson SP Ruwan Gunasekara said.
“Police are also said to be investigating to ascertain if any other cocaine parcels have been smuggled out from the container,” SP Gunasekara said.
Those arrested are said to be the driver of the truck and six labourers employed at the Ratmalana Economic Center including the two individuals who were found to be possession of the two cocaine packs.
Meanwhile, SP Gunasekara said the Police is unable to say where the shipment originated from as the investigation is in its initial stages yet.
