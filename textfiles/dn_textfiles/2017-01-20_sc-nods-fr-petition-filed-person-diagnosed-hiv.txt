SC nods for FR petition filed by a person diagnosed with HIV

 
For the first time in Sri Lankan judicial history a person who wishes to keep his HIV status undisclosed to the public has filed a Fundamental Rights petition in the Supreme Court.
He is seeking an order directing Sri Lankan Airlines to re-instate him for employment as cabin crew at the Airlines since his employment was terminated after the company learned he was HIV-positive.
The Supreme Court two-judge-bench comprising Chief Justice K. Sripavan and Justice Priyantha Jayawardena granted leave to proceed with the Fundamental Right petition filed by Attorney at law Kamani Madhya Jinadasa on behalf of the victim (X) and matter was fixed for argument May 30.
The petitioner cited Sri Lankan Airlines Limited, Group Medical Officer of Sri Lankan Airlines Dr. Anoma Jayasinghe, Secretary to the Ministry of Transport and Civil Aviation Nihal Somaweera, Director of National STD/AIDS Control Program Dr. Sisira Liyanage and the Attorney General as respondents in the petition.
The person wishes to keep his HIV status undisclosed to the public and is entitled to maintain confidentiality of his HIV status, as is the policy of the Government of Sri Lanka.
The petitioner stated that in or around 2010 “X” (victim) made an application to Mihin Lanka (Pvt.) Ltd. The petitioner stated that “X” joined the in-flight cabin staff as steward and continued to serve in the said airline, receiving appreciations etc. for his services and as at August 2016, the aforesaid “X” was a confirmed employee of Mihin Lanka.
The petitioner stated that during his employment with Mihin Lanka “X” was diagnosed as being HIV positive at a voluntary testing done in or around 2013.
The petitioner stated that since the Mihin Lanka did not require disclosure of HIV status and since “X” was under no obligation to disclose his HIV status to Mihin Lanka, the HIV status of “X” was not disclosed.
The petitioner stated that in or around June 2016, it was announced by the government that since Mihin Lanka was excessively debt-ridden, it would cease operations and would be amalgamated with the Sri Lankan Airlines.
The petitioner stated that the staff of Mihin Lanka were advised that operations of Mihin Lanka would be wound up by December 30, 2016, and were advised to seek alternative employment including at Sri Lankan Airlines. The petitioner stated that to the best of his “X”, the entire staff of Mihin Lanka were given the opportunity to apply for employment with Sri Lankan Airlines.
The petitioner stated that on or around September 27, 2016 “X” was called for an interview for the post of cabin crew with the Sri Lankan Airlines.
The petitioner stated that “X” faced the said interview and was selected and thereafter was required report to the medical centre of the Sri Lankan Airlines for basic assessment including height, weight, and eyesight.
The petitioner stated that during the said basic medical assessment “X” was required to fill a standard, from which it required “X” to disclose inter alia whether the applicant is the carrier of any Sexually Transmitted Infection (STI).
The petitioner stated that “X” was well aware that the National Policy on HIV and AIDS in the World of Work in Sri Lanka contained policies which inter alia declared that HIV screening is not required for purposes of employment and confidentiality of his HIV status made it non obligatory to disclose his HIV status in the said health form.
The petitioner sated that in the attendant circumstances, confused and conflicted as to how the said question in relation to whether “X” was the carrier of a STD ought to be answered and being aware that he was not obliged to answer as to his HIV status and fearing and being mortified that if the said question was left unanswered and answered in the affirmative the two nurses would publicly question him causing grave prejudice to the confidentiality concerning his HIV status and thereby stigmatizing him, “X” decided to answer the said question in the negative.
The petitioner stated that on about October 7, 2016, “X” was notified by a person attached to the Human Resource Department of the Sri Lankan Airlines as a cabin crewmember.
Thereafter “X” was further requested to collect his uniforms and suitcases from the Sri Lankan Airlines and also to give measurements for his jackets. The petitioner stated that on October 19, 2016, “X” was required to present himself at Nawaloka Hospital PLC for certain tests, including HIV screening.
The petitioner stated that on October 2016, “X” reported to the Human Resource Department of the Sri Lankan Airlines and signed the contract of employment and was issued a with a staff identity card and the in flight-bar cabinet access keys and name tags.
The petitioner further said the second respondent contacted “X” via telephone and requested “X” to meet her at the Hilton Hotel, Colombo to discuss the HIV status of “X”.
The petitioner stated that the second respondent had therafter requested “X” to hand over the appointment letter and the staff ID issued by Sri Lankan Airlines for safe keeping until the matter was resolved.
The petitioner said the decision of the Sri Lankan Airlines to subject “X” for an HIV screening, the subsequent constructive withdrawal of the appointment letter, and termination thereof on account of X’s HIV status and such other grounds upon his HIV status being made aware to the second respondent is wrongful.
The petitioner said “X” was informed that his services had been terminated as he failed his medical test.
The petitioner said Sri Lankan Airlines being a state instrument is bound by the National Policy on HIV and National Policy on HIV and AIDS in the World of Work in Sri Lanka.
The petitioner stated that the respondents were wrongful and unlawful and discriminatory because it disqualifies from employment as cabin crew any person who is HIV positive, without objective medical assessments to show that such persons are unsuitable for employment as cabin crew.
The petitioner seeks Supreme Court’s permission to conduct these proceedings in camera to maintain the confidentiality of the name and identity of “X”, the person concerned herein.
The petitioner is seeking a declaration that the Fundamental Rights of “X” guaranteed by Article 11, 12 (1), (2) and 14 (1)(g) of the constitution.
Counsel Senany Dayaratne, Thishya Weragoda, Eshanthi Mendis, Nishadi Wickramasinghe instructed by Nilika Dissanayake appeared for the petitioner. Additional Solicitor General Sanjay Rajaratnam appeared for the Attorney General.
