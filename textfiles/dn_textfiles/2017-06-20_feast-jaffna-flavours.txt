Feast on Jaffna flavours

“Jaffna is known for its Hindu tradition, art and creative culture, rich cultural heritage and natural beauty. It has been a peninsula ravaged by a civil war which ended in 2009, making it the focus of the world. However the time has come to give Jaffna its due place when it comes to cultural diversity. And that is the truly mouthwatering Jaffna Food culture. Daily News brings to you the Jaffna Food Festival.
“This is an annual event which we are hoping to start on June 22 till July 1. We have arranged a variety of promotions. There will be one to one promotions and special beer promotions. This is a family event so the whole family can come and enjoy the varieties of beverage promotions, food and entertainment. Our aim is to offer an insight into Jaffna cooked food for those who have not had the opportunity to taste it. For all those in Colombo it is short drive away,” said General Manager, Lalin Adhikari
Executive Chef, Eranda Herath, pointed out that when we talk about the Jaffna Food Festival it is combining Jaffna Food with two cultures – South Indian and the Sri Lankan.
“The food available has culinary features of the Hindu Culture. Jaffna is also a peninsula that is famed for its sea food – Crab and Prawns. The spices of Jaffna which are used to spice dishes makes the food flavorsome. This is the most important part of the preparations. If we need to sample the real Jaffna taste, with real Jaffna flavor we must go for these spices. We have a Chef from Jaffna Chef Chandru who will also be preparing the dishes. Chandru has an excellent knowledge and experience when comes to Jaffna cuisine and will prepare the dishes in its traditional manner. So I say to you, come on June 22 and feel the difference,” said Herath.
Public Relations and Sales Executive Deshani Perera said that one can enjoy a live band performance and emphasized that the event is a family event.
“I have introduced social media marketing this year. This is my marketing plan – Facebook. Twitter and Web Site promotions. This event is a significant event at GOH and we are doing this every year. We are planning on inviting reputed figures on the first day of the event,” said Perera.
Sales and Marketing Manager Thusha Nandakumar, commented that they are bringing the North food culture to Colombo city audience.
“You don’t get to sample the authentic food like this. This is an excellent feast for everyone. The cooks are from Jaffna and everything including the spices are almost homemade. The natural ambience of the hotel is amplified by Palmyra leaves. So I think this will be very unique experience for everyone involved. While sampling the food you can be assured that it is of the highest quality. So come and dine and have a good experience. This is one of GOH’s signatory events. This is the seventh successive year for us. So it will be real crowd puller this time,” said Nandakumar.
There is a huge variety of ingredients used to spice the dishes. Some have also been used in indigenous medicines - Asafetida, Cardamom, Cinnamon, Clove, Coriander, Cumin, Curry Leaves, Fenugreek, Ginger, Garlic, Mustard, Nutmeg, Onion, Pepper, Saffron, Tamarind, Turmeric, Honey, Lemon.
