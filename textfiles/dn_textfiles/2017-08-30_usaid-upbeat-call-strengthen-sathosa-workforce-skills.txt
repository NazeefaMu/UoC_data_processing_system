USAID upbeat on call to strengthen Sathosa workforce skills

The United States Agency for International Development (USAID) Mission to Sri Lanka has sent positive vibes on a call to strengthen the workforce skills of the country’s largest state owned retail store chain, Lanka Sathosa.
“We are empowered to work with the private sector” stressed USAID’s Deputy Head of Mission in Colombo Elisabeth Davnie Eston during her meeting with the Minister of Industry and Commerce Rishad Bathiudeen recently at the Minister’s office, Colombo 3. The five member USAID team led by Davnie Eston here mapped out ways and means in which USAID could collaborate on ventures of the Ministry of Industry and Commerce. During this meeting Minister Bathiudeen called to enlist the USAID Mission here to boost soft skills of Lanka Sathosa personnel in par with the country’s competitive retail market environment at large.
From 1999-2003 USAID worked with the Ministry of Industry on the ‘The Competitiveness Initiative’, more recently at the request Minister Bathiudeen, USAID support was extended to formulate the Export Strategic Plan for 2015 - 2020, Fair Trade Certification, the promotional strategy for Ceylon Cinnamon in the US market, efficient energy management for export oriented coconut based industries in Wayamba, review of the handloom industry and livelihood support for war widows.
“The Ministry of Industry and Commerce has been working with USAID since 2005 in various initiatives to enhance the Ministry’s mandate,” said Minister Bathiudeen and added: “I thank USAID for the ongoing support being extended to us. We have launched many initiatives to develop Lanka Sathosa to make it competitive. A private consultancy firms was enlisted to focus on the development of its many processes. We are embarking on expanding the number of stores across the country to 500 by the end of this year in all types of Lanka Sathosa stores. We have seven categories of stores and this proposed expansion impacts all of them.
The present staff strength of 3800 too is expected to increase as a result, to 5000, by end of this year. More importantly, we welcome a compatible skills training project at USAIDS to enhance Lanka Sathosa staff.”
