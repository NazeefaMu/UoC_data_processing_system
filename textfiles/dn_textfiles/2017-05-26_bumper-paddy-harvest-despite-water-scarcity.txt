Bumper paddy harvest despite water scarcity

The Hambantota District reaped a bumper paddy harvest even with a scarcity of water due to proper management, Hambantota District Director of Agriculture Hemantha Amarasinghe said.
He said 145 bushels of paddy were reaped, according to a survey conducted recently.
Amarasinghe added that the farmers at Lunugamwehera, Ridiyagama and Liyangastota as well as irrigation officials contributed greatly towards this achievement. Meanwhile, the construction work of the weekly pola building at Karametiya in Katuwana is progressing at snail’s pace for the last four years, traders said. They added that the traders and consumers are the worst affected. Traders said they have been engaged in business at the old weekly pola for the last 25 years and now they are left high and dry as a result of dismantling the old weekly pola building to set up a new building.
They urge authorities to expedite the construction work and provide them some relief.
