Artificial insemination programmes for animals prove a success

Artificial insemination programmes for animals implemented in the Southern region have become a success.
According to the Southern Provincial Animal Productions and Health Department, the programmes are underway at the Veterinary Surgeons’ Divisions level in the Galle, Matara and Hambantota districts.
The provincial department will provide fodder, mineral mixtures, veterinary drugs and medicines for cattle breeders at concessionary rates.
