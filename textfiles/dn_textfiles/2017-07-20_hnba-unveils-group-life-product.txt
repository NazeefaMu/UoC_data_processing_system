HNBA unveils Group Life Product

HNB Assurance (HNBA) unveiled its Group Life Product, offering four predefined packages that businesses could choose from in providing the financial protection that their staff need.
Speaking on the importance of providing a solid platform of protection to employees, Managing Director and CEO of HNBA and its fully owned subsidiary HNB General Insurance Limited (HNBGI), Deepthi Lokuarachchi said, “We live in a period of time of rising costs and risks. In a tight economic backdrop, small and medium scale enterprises (SMEs) find it challenging to provide solid forms of protection plans for their employees due to higher underwritten premiums or under-evaluating the risk component associated. SMEs in Sri Lanka play a major role in today’s economy as it uplifts economic diversification. The Group Life product of HNBA is a lot more than a spring of protection for your employees.”
Prasantha Fernando, Chief Operating Officer of HNBA elaborating on this product added “companies could choose from one of the four packages that we have to offer that ranges from just providing a basic life cover for one’s staff, to providing an annuity, to offering a comprehensive bouquet of covers that include critical illness, disability cover and hospital cash”.
HNB Assurance (HNBA) is one of the fastest growing Insurance Companies in Sri Lanka with a network of 56 branches. HNBA is a Life Insurance company with a rating of A (lka) by Fitch Ratings Lanka for “National Insurer Financial Strength Rating” and “National Long- term Rating”.
