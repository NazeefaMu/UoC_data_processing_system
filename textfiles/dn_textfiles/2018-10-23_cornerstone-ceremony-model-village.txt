Cornerstone ceremony for model village

Foundation stones for a model village coming under the Ranaviru housing scheme were laid last Saturday, at Mangalagama in Eravur Pattu.
The National Housing Development Authority had provided Rs.200,000 for the construction work and Rs.300,000 as loans for the endeavour. Batticaloa Ranaviru Seva Authority Project Officer T.H. Keethiga Jeyawardana presided over the ceremony where Buddhist monks, Batticaloa Government Agent M. Uthayakumar, Eravur Pattu Divisional Secretary N. Vilwaretnam, and Mangalagama Police OIC H.M.S. Dissanayake laid the foundation stones.
