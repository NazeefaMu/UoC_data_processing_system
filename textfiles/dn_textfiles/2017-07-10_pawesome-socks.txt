Pawesome socks

Ever wanted to take a walk on the wild side? Well now you can thanks to these funky socks that’ll turn your feet into animal paws! They’re made from 100 percent polyester and there are two designs to choose from depending on whether you’re a cat or dog person.
So if you’re tired of wearing the same old boring socks to work every day, why not spice up your sock drawer – and your office – by pulling on a pair of animal paws! They’re available to buy for $11.95 from a website called (rather appropriately) What On Earth, and we think everybody should own a pair of these seriously pawesome socks. Bored Panda
