Brand Fundamentals, a workshop towards growing Sri Lankan brands, jointly organized by Informatics Holdings Ltd and the Informatics Institute of Technology (IIT) was held on May 30 at Ramada, Colombo.

Having played an integral role in making Nando’s one of the best success stories in Africa, Kühne also launched Comedy Central in the region. The idea for this workshop was born during one of the keynote speeches delivered by Kühne in Mauritius.
His insightful take on ‘Creating Great African Brands’ was seen by Informatics Holdings as an area that was timely, relevant and easily translatable into a Sri Lankan context.
Speaking on the need for a masterclass in brand building, Group Managing Director of Informatics Holdings, Hiran Wickramasinghe said, “As a homegrown company, at Informatics we are well attuned to the needs local industries, not only from an IT perspective but also from the point of view of the challenges they face with global brands. A workshop on brand strategy, especially seen through the lens of an emerging market as opposed to the usual UK and US brands was a much needed forum.”
Kühne said, “I believe that the world shouldn’t rely solely on brands from the US or Europe. And for brands from emerging markets to be successful, they need to make brand strategy a core area of focus. However the cost to do so is generally a hurdle, and through this workshop conducted in partnership with Informatics Holdings and IIT, I hope to eliminate that to some extent.”
