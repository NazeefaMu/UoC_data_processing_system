ComBank celebrates Children’s Day with itn

Commercial Bank of Ceylon once again partnered with ITN to celebrate World’s Children’s Day at an event at the Mahaweli Ground in Weli Oya in the Northern Province recently.
Over 2,000 schoolchildren in the area enjoyed games and received give aways at this event, the highlight of which was a 9D cinema experience. The event was supported by Commercial Bank’s signature Children’s Savings Account ‘Arunalu,’ which was featured at a stall that was one of the main attractions for the young participants, due to the many interactive games that it made available.
All children who attended the Children’s Day celebratory event were presented with attractive Arunalu branded gifts including caps, bags and umbrellas. Commercial Bank said it intends to provide similar experiences to children living in the outstations at future events of this nature in keeping with its brand promise of being the nation’s bank.
The Arunalu Children’s Savings Account offers the highest interest rate of 6.5% for Children’s Savings Accounts in the country, and can be opened at any of Commercial Bank’s branches with a minimum deposit of Rs 100. It has established the largest cash prize scheme in Sri Lanka for year 5 students with a three-tiered scholarship scheme that rewards students placed first, second or third at the national, district or school levels at the Year 5 scholarship examination.
