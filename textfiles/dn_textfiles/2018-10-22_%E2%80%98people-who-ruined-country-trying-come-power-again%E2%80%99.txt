‘People who ruined the country trying to come to power again’

During the yahapalana regime, development is taking place in various parts of the country without any racial, religion or caste bias.
People who wish to topple the government are going about the country preaching that the government is not doing any of this for the welfare of the country.
People who have already ruined the country are trying to come to power again, said Housing and Construction Minister Sajith Premadasa.
He was speaking on the occasion of the opening of the 141st and 142nd model villages in Supeedsam Nagar (25 houses) and Viluthu Nagar (18 houses) in Kokkuvil in the Manmunai North Secretarial Division, Batticaloa, on Saturday.
“Parties who fanned racial flames were defeated and they were now trying to come back to power. The voters will teach them a lesson. Today, we have built national amity and cordiality between the races. We must not allow this to be disrupted. We are in the process of fulfilling the dreams of the houseless and identifying the homeless communities in the Batticaloa district and taking action to meet their needs quickly. I appeal to the Government Agent, the National Housing Department officials and Divisional Secretary to help in this matter,” he said.
Deputy Minister Alisahir Mowlana, Batticaloa District Parliamentarian G. Srinesan, Batticaloa Mayor T. Saravanapavan, Batticaloa Government Agent M. Uthayakumar, National Housing Authority District Manager K. Jeganathan, Manmunai North Divisional Secretary M. Thayaparan and Municipal Councillors were present.
