JO protest against privatisation plans

The Joint Opposition (JO) yesterday said they will organise a protest against the government’s plans to privatise the Mattala International Airport in Hambantota on October 6.
UPFA Parliamentarian Dullas Allahapperuma told journalists in Colombo that the JO will launch a peoples’ protest to protest the government’s sinister moves to sell national assets to foreigners for a song.
Allahapperuma alleged that the government has already signed the Hambantota Port agreement and also plans to privatise the Mattala International Airport to a neighbouring country. He also said the airport had vast potential for the development of the tourism industry.
Allahapperuma alleged that the Government plans to sell it for Rs.27 billion.
