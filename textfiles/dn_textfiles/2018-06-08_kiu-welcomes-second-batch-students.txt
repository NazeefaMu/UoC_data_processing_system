KIU welcomes second batch of students

KIU held a ceremony on May 25, at the KIU auditorium to welcome the students for the Biomedical Science, Psychology, Management, KAATSU and Acupuncture degree programs.
The occasion was graced by the honorary Vice Chancellor of KIU, Senior Prof. Neluka Fernando and the KIU Managing Director Dr. Jagath Senevirathne.
The highlight at the ceremony was the participation of the second batch of the students, who joined KIU through the interest free loan scheme 2017.
The interest free loan scheme was introduced through the budget proposal of 2017 to provide opportunities for the students who were denied entry to a state university even though they got through A/L.
Under the recommendation from the Ministry of Education and the accreditation of the University Grants Commission several other private universities have come together along with KIU for the interest free student loan whilst KIU has been able to become the leading university with the highest number of enrollments.
This initiative step was taken by KIU University to support the government’s program of assisting students who have gotten through their A/L exam but have financial difficulties, so that they can realize their dreams. KIU as a pioneer in territory education is proud to be a part of this gigantic step towards a better future for those who deserve a chance.
