Special commodity levy on imported sugar increased

The special commodity levy on imported sugar has been increased by Rs.10 per kilogramme from midnight yesterday. The last time the levy was increased was in September 2016; when it was increased by Rs.2 per kilogramme for white sugar and Rs.15 per kilogramme on raw sugar, in order to support locally produced sugar which was about to enter the market.
Sri Lanka produces around 50,000 MT of raw (Brown) sugar annually which is less than 10 percent of the annual brown sugar need. The decision to increase the levy has been taken by the Cabinet Sub Committee on Cost of Living.
