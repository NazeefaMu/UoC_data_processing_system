Kaneko’s concert at Colombo Uni

 World renowned Japanese Koto and Shamisen Player Sumie Kaneko will hold a concert on September 28 at the Management Faculty Auditorium of the University of Colombo.
Sumie will be assisted by Co-Musician Jagath Mapalagama from the University of Visual and Performing Arts, Colombo.
Koto and Shamisen are Japanese traditional music instruments. Kaneko is an internationally-recognized Japanese koto and shamisen player. She has been recognised as a pioneer by her chromatic use of the two instruments.
A master in the traditional repertoire of these instruments, she has also pioneered their use in experimental music, through solo and group performances worldwide.
The Japanese Embassy in Colombo has organised the concert to showcase traditional Japanese instrumental music to the music lovers in Sri Lanka.
