Maldivians can get kidney transplants in Colombo: Not Indians

Although kidney operations are banned for Indian nationals, Maldivian nationals can get kidney operations done in Sri Lanka without any problem, Health Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne had stated.
Minister Senaratne had stated that although kidney operations were banned by the Sri Lankan Government for Indian nationals due to a racket, this ban does not apply to Maldivians.
Minister Senaratne had expressed those views during a recent meeting held with Maldivian Health Minister Abdulla Nazim Ibrahim.
Minister Senaratne had stated that kidney operations would be done for all Maldivian individuals under the recommendation of the Maldivian Government.
He had also made a request from Minister Ibrahim to do regular screening for HIV/AIDS and Tuberculosis (TB) for Sri Lankan workers employed in Maldives.
The Ministers had agreed to discuss the topic again and sign the relevant agreements in September during the WHO sessions for South and South East Asian countries.
