Sri Lanka look to increase cinnamon exports

Sri Lanka has earned an annual income of 160 million US dollars by exporting cinnamon products. One objective is to increase this earning to one billion US dollars by 2020, Primary Industries Minister Daya Gamage said. He said his Ministry also hoped to double the export income through other agricultural export crops.
He was addressing the launching of the Ministry’s official newsletter ‘Bihidora’ published in association with Lake House recently.
Minister Gamage said their endeavour was to add cinnamon to the list of Sri Lankan exports in addition to tea, rubber and coconut. He said the government had to develop. The economy while managing the immense debt burden left by the previous regime. The country could be relieved of this debt burden by increasing the export income. The Prime Minister had laid down a target for them to double the export earnings by 2020.
They had to make a planned approach to reach this target. For this they had to solicit the participation of all, including the Ministry and Export agriculture department officials by utilizing new technology and identifying new markets. Today the country earned the largest income by sending expatriate workers abroad. This situation had to be changed because families are torn apart and children became neglected due to sending women workers abroad.
