Unity  in diversity

This writer believes in plural societies where there is respect for diversity which does not cause internal upheavals and wars, hence the call for secularism. What does it mean to say that we live in a secular age? Secularism inhabits twin strands—one simply strives to control religion; another, more composite view, allows plural views on faith to coexist.
One understanding of secularity then is in terms of public spaces. as we function within various spheres of activity — economic, political, cultural, educational, professional, recreational — the norms and principles we follow, the deliberations we engage in, generally don't refer us to God or to any religious beliefs.
Inescapable in earlier centuries in Christendom. If we go back a few centuries in our civilisation, we see that God was present in the above sense in a whole host of social practices — not just the political — and at all levels of society. In those societies, you couldn't engage in any kind of public activity without “encountering God” in the above sense. But the situation is totally different today.
Secularity in this sense is a matter of the whole context of understanding in which our moral, spiritual or religious experience and search takes place.
Secular options
One view, secularism is mainly concerned with controlling religion. Its task is to define the place of religion in public life and to keep it firmly in this location. This doesn’t need to involve strife or repression, provided various religious actors understand and respect these limits. But the various rules and measures which make up the secularist regime all have this basic purpose.
The other view the main point of a secularist regime is to manage the religious and -philosophical diversity of views (including non- and anti-religious views) fairly and democratically. Of course, this task will include setting certain limits to religiously motivated action in the public sphere, but it will also involve similar limits on those espousing non- or anti-religious philosophies. Religion is thus not the prime focus of secularism.
Managing diversity
Managing diversity involves a complex requirement. There is more than one good sought here. We can single out three, which we can class in the three categories of the French Revolutionary trinity: liberty, equality, fraternity. 1) No one must be forced in the domain of religion or basic belief. This is what is often defined as religious liberty, including, of course, the freedom not to believe. This is what is also described as the ‘free exercise’ of religion, in the terms of the US First Amendment. 2) There must be equality between people of different faiths or basic belief; no religious outlook (religious or areligious) can enjoy a privileged status, let alone be adopted as the official view of the state. And, (3) all spiritual families must be heard, included in the ongoing process of determining what the society is about (its political identity), and how it is going to realise these goals (the exact regime of rights and privileges).
We might add a fourth goal: that we try as much as possible to maintain relations of harmony and comity between the supporters of different religions.
If we look at the three goals above, they are concerned respectively, with (1) protecting people in their belonging and/or practice of whatever outlook they choose or find themselves in; with (2) treating people equally whatever their option, and (3) giving them all a hearing.
The point of state neutrality is precise to avoid favouring or disfavouring not just religious positions, but any basic position, religious or non-religious.
If we move, however, beyond such originating contexts, and look at our situation today—at the kinds of societies we are now living in the West—the first feature that strikes us is the wide and growing diversity, not only of religious views but also of those which involve no religion, not to speak of those which are unclassifiable.
Points to reflect
A state must not discriminate on grounds of religion in the distribution of active citizenship rights. Second, in keeping with the spirit of inter-religious equality as well as equality of citizenship, a fully secular state extends rights to minority religious groups.
Secularism is grounded in notions of equality – equal concern and respect – and therefore goes far beyond the notion of inter-religious tolerance. Respecting other religions as equals does not entail their blind acceptance or endorsement. Indeed, it is precise because respect is consistent with difference and critique that the idea of equal respect for all religions is closely linked with the proposal for an inter-faith dialogue.
We have managed respect and relations between religions fairly well. However, we have also seen the rise of religious intolerance for close over two decades in our country. The world is being torn up in some settings based on religious beliefs of the believers. We are not immune from such dangers. It is for those reasons this piece argues to look closer, for greater, consistent, informed, respectful dialogue, picking up on emerging points of conflict early and ensuring full respect for the celebration of faiths we so often see in Sri Lankan where not only do religious icons of different religions find place in one location of prayer but also where people of different faiths pray in places of worship of more than one religion. The spiritual leaders and theologians amongst them must play a sustained role in this endeavour.
