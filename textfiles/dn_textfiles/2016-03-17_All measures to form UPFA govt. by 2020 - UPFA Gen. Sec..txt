All measures to form UPFA govt. by 2020 - UPFA Gen. Sec.

UPFA General Secretary Minister Mahinda Amaraweera said he would take all possible measures to form a UPFA government by 2020.
He said he would initially build a cordial rapport with all parties under the UPFA banner aiming to create a broader alliance that would go to form a UPFA government by 2020.
Minister Amaraweera made these remarks after assuming duties as the UPFA General Secretary at the Sri Lanka Freedom Party headquarters yesterday.
"My initial aim is to strengthen the UPFA by bringing many parties under its banner. Discussions will be held with parties which are in the UPFA to create a cordial rapport with each party. Initially, discussions will be held with 12 parties in the near future," he said.
Attention will be drawn towards attracting other parties which are currently not with the UPFA, but work closely with the UPFA during elections. As the final outcome, a broader alliance will be created under the leadership of President Maithripala Sirisena," he said. "Any party can join the UPFA aiming to achieve a common goal, if they accept the policies of the UPFA," he said.
Questioned whether disciplinary action will be taken against SLFP members those who participate in the protest launched by the joint opposition today, he said that decision will be taken by the SLFP Central Committee. Amaraweera noted that he was confident and certain that they can prevent a probable split in the UPFA. He said SLFP members will never work towards splitting the UPFA as they put the party first.
"Besides, they have very clearly understood that the UNP will benefit if the party splits," he said.
He added that the good governance government is neither a SLFP nor UNP government. Therefore, it is unethical to describe this is an UNP government. However, there should be discipline in the SLFP and the UPFA.
Speaking on development projects which are at a standstill, he said many of the proposed development and infrastructure development projects will commence by next month. It has been planned to start all key projects by next month.
Amaraweera requested people to be vigilant as certain politicians with vested interests are trying to arouse the people for their petty political gains.
"As a result of this situation, farmers have been protesting asking for a fertilizer subsidy. Being a son of a farmer, the President would never allow the curtailment of the fertiliser subsidy or any other benefits enjoyed by farmers," he said.
SLFP General Secretary Duminda Dissanayake said the UPFA will be driven towards victory by forming much broader alliance.
Former UPFA General Secretary Susil Premajayantha said he has undergone immense hardships as the UPFA General Secretary.
He and Minister Anura Priyadarshana Yapa are the only persons who know much about the UPFA.
