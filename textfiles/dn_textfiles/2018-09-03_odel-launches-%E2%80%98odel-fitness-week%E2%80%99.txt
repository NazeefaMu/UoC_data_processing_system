ODEL launches ‘ODEL Fitness Week’

Health and fitness has grown in popularity in the recent past in Sri Lanka, with a multitude of different exercise and workout options available, while a myriad calorie conscious dining and health food stores have opened around the city.
In order to play an active role and ride on this trend, ODEL launched ‘ODEL Fitness Week’ which saw a week’s worth of offers and activities to make ODEL the go-to destination for all fitness needs amongst fitness enthusiasts.
“A person who is fit, is capable of living life to its fullest. Physical and mental fitness plays a very important role in our lives today and people who are both, physically and mentally fit, are less prone to fall sick. It is with this in mind that ODEL, Sri Lanka’s leading fashion retailer, decided to introduce the ‘ODEL Fitness Week’ in our annual calendar to create more awareness of the need to stay fit. We feel this is a growing social need and we’d like to take the lead as a responsible fashion retailer in being a keen advocate of fitness and the myriad benefits it offers. During the ‘ODEL Fitness Week’ we have introduced a flat 20% off on our full suite of international sportswear brands. Free gifts on super foods at ODEL Delight, 10% off on wellness teas at Blend and nutritious menu options at the Promenade are some of the other offers during the week. Being fit is paramount to looking good and ODEL is all for making their customers both look good as well as feel good”, said Desiree Karunaratne, Group Director Marketing, Softlogic Holdings PLC, under which umbrella ODEL PLC operates.
In order to take a leadership role in driving fitness and wellness, ODEL used its group synergies to further offer the market all more by reaching out to its subsidiaries – Softlogic Life and Asiri Hospitals to enable the market to ensure that their path to being fit and healthy is holistic.
During the week, Softlogic Life conducted BMI Testing throughout the week and rewarded shoppers who had the perfect BMI; in addition shoppers at ODEL were also able to avail themselves to Random Blood Sugar Testing as well as Blood Pressure Testing that was being conducted by Asiri Hospitals on site.
That was not all, during the week, The Promenade too had a variety of special healthy menus for lunch and dinner offered by Sugar Bistro, Roots, The Regent, and Magic Corn for health conscious shoppers.
Another highlight of ODEL’s Fitness Week was the scintillating panel discussion on the importance of fitness, well-being and looking good, all of which are the cornerstones of ODEL’s ethos. The panelists included Everest achiever Johann Peiris, nutritionist Ronali of RAW who advocates the goodness of raw fruits and vegetables, Omalka Guneratne an up and coming rugby star, former model and model coordinator Jackie Mae, hair and beauty icon Ramani Fernando, and Desiree Karunaratne, Group Director Marketing, Softlogic Holdings.
