United States torpedoes Iran nuclear deal

President Donald Trump announced on May 8 that the United States will pull out of the Iran nuclear deal known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPA), which he described as “rotten to the core”. It was signed with Iran by the five permanent members of the UN Security Council - France, Great Britain, United States, China, Russia – and Germany.
Attempts by European powers France, Germany and Great Britain to influence President Trump to change his mind failed. This is likely to intensify the rift between the US and its European allies. However, it is not yet certain whether the latter would succumb to US pressure or decide to defy it. Meanwhile, French Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian says the Iranian nuclear deal is “not dead” despite US President Donald Trump's decision to withdraw.
European Union Foreign Ministers aim to reassure Tehran that the JCPA is salvageable. They have called a meeting on Monday in London for which they have invited their Iranian counterpart Mohammad Javad Zarif to attend.
The European Union's diplomatic chief Federica Mogherini has said the bloc is “determined to preserve” the Iran nuclear deal. “As long as Iran continues to implement its nuclear related commitments, as it is doing so far, the European Union will remain committed to the continued full and effective implementation of the nuclear deal,” she said.
In another development which seems to reveal that Washington’s foreign policy initiatives are taken according to prescriptions written in Tel Aviv, Israel Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu criticized the deal publicly a few days ago and alleged that Iran is secretly developing nuclear weapons. The United States will also shift their Embassy in Israel to Jerusalem next week in defiance of world public opinion and international agreements under which Jerusalem has a special position as a Holy City for Jews, Muslims and Christians. Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates and Yemen have also supported the United States withdrawal.
Iran rejected the charge while the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) said that Iran has complied with all terms of the Accord. It has allowed the International Atomic Energy Agency to mount the most rigorous intrusive regime ever devised, “an obligation on Iran that lasts until 2040”.
Iran has relinquished 95% of its low-enriched uranium, placed two-thirds of its centrifuges in storage, and removed the core of its heavy water reactor, thus closing off the plutonium route to development of a bomb.
The JCPA signed in 2015 decided to lift US and international sanctions against Iran, which in turn agreed not to enrich Uranium beyond the limits stipulated in the Accord.
Iranian President Hassan Rouhani said that Iran is ready to abide by the Accord if the other signatories (except the US) are willing to continue the Accord without the United States.
With the United States' withdrawal the possibility of increasing destabilization of the Middle Eastern region is inevitable. Oil prices are also likely to rise steeply on account of mounting insecurity and possible war with Iran.
Hezbollah triumphs in Lebanon
In Lebanese elections held after nine years on May 5, Hezbollah led by Hassan Nasrullah and its allies have secured a majority. They have won at least 67 out of a total of 128 seats in Parliament. Hezbollah’s armed wing is fighting in Syria against the anti-government rebels and has strong links with both Syria and Iran. Thus the Lebanese people have distanced themselves from the West which will now face a much stronger opposition in Iran, Syria, Lebanon and Turkey together with Russia in West Asia.
Prime Minister Saad Hariri’s Future Movement party could secure only 21 seats. Its pro-Western policies have not gone well with the voters.
Hezbollah's allies include the Amal Movement led by Parliament Speaker Nabih Berri and the Christian Free Patriotic Movement founded by President Michel Aoun.
The parliamentary seats are split evenly - 64 for Christians and 64 for Muslims. These groups are also further divided among 11 religious groups. Thus any coalition government would comprise disparate elements which could sometimes generate conflicts of interest.
However, the main thing is that conservative and pro-West forces would find it more difficult to disarm Hezbollah. Israel is likely to intensify its confrontation with Hezbollah and other pro-Syrian forces in Lebanon.
Mahathir Mohamad comes back to power in Malaysia
Veteran ex-leader Mahathir Mohamad, 92, has won a historic election victory, Thursday, ending the six-decade rule of the Barisan Nasional (BN) coalition.
The Opposition Alliance he leads won 115 seats obtaining an absolute majority needed in parliament to form a government.
Mahathir, who will become the world's oldest prime minister, came out of retirement to take on Prime Minister Najib Razak, who has become embroiled in massive corruption scandal surrounding state fund 1MDB.
