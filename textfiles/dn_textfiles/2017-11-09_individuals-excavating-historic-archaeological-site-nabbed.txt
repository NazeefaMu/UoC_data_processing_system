Individuals excavating historic archaeological site nabbed

A Grama Niladhari and his colleague who were excavating a historic archaeological site in the Meewewa area have been arrested by Narammala Police, who received a tip-off through the emergency hotline.
At the time of arrest, the two suspects had been digging a pit in the premises of an ancient Buddhist temple. Meanwhile, a youth who sold heroin in the guise of a gram seller has been arrested by Kuliyapitiya Police officers.
The suspect was produced before Kuliyapitiya Magistrate Ruwan Dhammika Perera, who ordered the suspect to be kept in remand custody until November 13.
Kuliyapitiya Police sources revealed that about 43 suspects who sold heroin to students and youths have been arrested in the Kuliyapitiya area during the past six months.
About 15 special Police officers have been deployed to trace harmful drug dealers who sell drugs to teenagers and students of the Kurunegala District, a senior Police officer attached to the Kuliyapitiya Police told the Daily News yesterday.
