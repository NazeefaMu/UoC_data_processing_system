Shilpa Kala 2017 begins on May 25 at BMICH

Shilpa Kala handicrafts sales exhibition organised by the Indian High Commission in collaboration with Hands of Sri Lanka – National Crafts Foundation and Daskari Haat Samithi will be held at Nugasevana, BMICH, from May 25 to 28.
Over 25 Indian and 14 Sri Lankan craftsmen are scheduled to participate in this event.
India has always been a loyal friend and neighbour of Sri Lanka from the ancient times – which continues to remain. The arts and crafts industry in Sri Lanka too has its Indian influences.
Known for its colorful and attractive display of crafts and artwork from every province, India takes great pride in showcasing the skills and talents of its craftsmen who have mastered the work for generations, keeping up with their tradition.
The handicrafts industry in Sri Lanka dates back to King Devanampiyatissa’s time, where Sangamitta , the daughter of the great emperor Asoka, brought a sampling of the Bo tree in which Lord Buddha found enlightenment.
Various handicrafts such as pottery, jewellery, clay and wood carvings, which have been found from different areas in the country depict the rich culture and heritage Sri Lanka had back then, and also the valuable connection with our Indian counterparts.
The Sri Lankan public is yet to experience a spectacular event which combines two nations in the world of handicrafts, not only showcasing the talents of their master craftsmen, but also creating an opportunity to promote friendship and goodwill and exchange new ideas and concepts between the two countries on one stage.
Shilpa Kala 2017 will showcase a colorful array of handicrafts and textiles identical to different parts in both countries.
The main purpose of this event is not only to showcase the cultural diversities but also to enhance the livelihood of the artisans of both countries, giving them recognition for their hard work and better value for their products.
A wide variety of handicraft and textiles from India will be displayed such as wood products, painted fabrics, fashion jewellery, handloom saris, handbags and leather products, while a attractive galore of Sri Lankan items depicting batik, wood carvings, lace, ceramics, Dumbara work, embroidery, silver and copperware, reed items and clayware will be on display.
According to the Chairman, Hands of Sri Lanka - National Crafts Foundation, Dr. Buddhi Keerthisena, they expect many foreigners too to visit this exhibition. “The Indian High Commission has extended its fullest support to make this event a success. The visit of Indian Prime Minister Dr. Narendra Modi for the International Vesak Festival recently has given additional focus to the event.”
