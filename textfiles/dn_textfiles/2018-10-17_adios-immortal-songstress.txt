Adios the immortal songstress!

Classical music remained second religion for her. She worshipped the Buddha, lived with music and blessed Sri Lanka with extraordinarily classical music for well over half a century. She is Professor Amara Ranatunga who passed away at 79. Her demise leaves a void in Sri Lankan culture for many reasons.
Born on August 22, 1939, at Hanwella to Don Wiyolis Kasthuriarachchi, Head Master of the Hanwella Primary School and Dona Alpinona Meegahapola, Dona Amara Kasthuriarachchi was the fifth of the eleven children of their music-loving family.
Though her parents had no scholarship over music as a subject, they loved music passionately. Their keenness and enthusiasm inspired the children – Amara well included.
As a young pupil, she used to take her music books and run to the bus halt to reach Colombo. Dayaratna Ranatunga, who was to be her husband later in life, and Amara Ranatunga were the pioneer students of the Government College of Fine Arts Heywood (known as University of Visual and Performing Arts). The much revered academic institute was open mostly to train teachers. The extraordinary talent both Amara and Dayaratne showed in their performances opened them to the gates of the Music College at the age of 12.
Amara first got introduced to music and dancing by watching the performances of her older siblings. Dr B S Wijeratne and Dr Lionel Edirisinghe, oldest veteran vocal trainers of Heywood and the great Sitarist Dr B S Wijeratne and K A Dayaratne Silva were the maestros.
Generally, the music degree course was for three years. Amara and Dayaratne followed it for six years, and when they reached the age of 18 years, their knowledge in `Raagadaari Sangeethaya’ was equivalent to the level of a Masters degree.
During her six years at Heywood, she never missed a single day. She would come to Colombo from Hanwella after the school. It was hard.
The enthusiasm kept her alive and energetic. Music has been part of her life, body and soul.
The doors of Radio Ceylon were open to Amara and Dayaratne by Dr.Lionel Edirisinghe and Ananda Sarath Wimalaweera when they were about 10 or 11 years. Hence the `Radio Mahagedara’ is not a strange place to the veteran duo. Both got a lot of chances to perform in many children’s programmes broadcast on the National Radio Service.
Amara means immortal in oriental lore.
Amara Ranatunga will stay in our hearts as an immortal songstress.
