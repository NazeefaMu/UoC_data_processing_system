All domestic airports to be made operational - Transport Minister

Transport Minister Nimal Siripala de Silva said yesterday the country’s domestic airports will be made operational, to transport tourists and for public transport purposes.
Minister de Silva was speaking during a tour to inspect the renovation work at the Batticaloa domestic airport yesterday.
He said there are 14 domestic airports across the country and all of them were not opened to the public due to the conflict situation. They were managed by the Sri Lanka Air Force. But, thanks to the peaceful situation prevailing in the country after 2009, we have the opportunity to make use of the domestic airports for local and foreign transport purposes and to promote tourism.
“We hope that with the opening of the domestic airport in Batticaloa, more tourists would visit scenic places such as Arugam Bay. From Colombo to Batticaloa, it takes eight hours by train, six hours by bus, but, only 45 minutes by air. Therefore, measures have already been taken to develop the Batticaloa domestic airport under the new programme.
The minister has instructed Civil Aviation Authority authorities to construct a Aircraft repairing center, a yard to park light aircraft and pilot training academy at the Batticaloa domestic airport.
The Road Development Authority with the assistance of Sri Lanka Air Force is renovating the Batticaloa Internal Airport at a cost of Rs. 1,400 million under the supervision of the Transport Ministry. All construction activities are expected to be completed by December and arrangements have been made to commence flight services to and from Batticaloa with effect from January next year.
