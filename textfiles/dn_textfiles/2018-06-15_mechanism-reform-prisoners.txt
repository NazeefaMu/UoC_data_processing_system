Mechanism to reform prisoners

Education Minister Akila Viraj Kariyawasam said that reading habit should be cultivated among all the people of the country including prison inmates.
The Minister has proposed a mechanism to cultivate reading habit among prison inmates prior to entering in to the society. By cultivating reading habit among prison inmates, they can be converted to useful persons to the society, he added.
The Minister said so, while offering books to rural libraries and donating furniture to the libraries, which were damaged by the recent flood, at the Library and Documentation Service Board yesterday.
According to the Minister, prison inmates can easily be educated and made knowledgeable through cultivating reading habit.
Addressing the gathering, the Minister pointed out that prisoners tend to involve in various vicious acts after entering in to prisons and the habit of reading is an ideal solution for refraining them from falling prey in to various forms of nasty acts. Then, it is a need to introduce a suitable mechanism to drive these persons to the correct path and to make them useful to the society.
Speaking on his suggestion, the Minister said that there may be room for prison inmates to get knowledge by reading.
