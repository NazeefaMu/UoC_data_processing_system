Priyankara in Opposition side while Ven. Rathana maintains status quo

Puttalam District Parliamentarian Piyankara Jayaratne, who recently resigned from the portfolio of Provincial Councils State Minister and Local Government sat on the Opposition side in Parliament yesterday.
A little while later after the House resumed sittings, MP Jayaratne arrived in the House from the entrance allocated for the Opposition MPs and took a seat in the second row of the opposition ranks while the Joint Opposition MPs thumped their desks. Some members of the Joint Opposition Group were seen coming to MP Jayaratne’s seat to welcome his decision and to congratulate him. However JHU Parliamentarian Ven Aturaliye Rathana Thera who recently announced that he would sit independently in Parliament was seen sitting in his usual seat in the front row of the government side.
