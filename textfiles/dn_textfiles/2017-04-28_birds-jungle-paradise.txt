Birds Jungle Paradise

Guidebook writer Juliet Coombe found Jetwing Kurulubedda an amazing retreat from the busy world of stress and noise. Here you can relax spend your evenings on bird watching walks or just watch the sun set or rise over the river before having a swim in the Kurulubedda pool overlooking the idyllic paddy field.
A handsome prince
If it is harvesting time the team encourage their guests to have a go as it is fun and so they can truly understand how challenging growing and harvesting rice really is. Whether one is sitting in the tree house fine dinning area or trying garden fresh kirayala fruits from the trees with a touch of lime one of Prabhath’s delicious welcome drinks, or learning how to make a fishing line so you can have a go at this ancient river tradition one can do nothing more here than truly kick back and relax. If you are not a jungle Jane and do not believe kissing a frog will turn one of natures creatures into a handsome prince then this is probably not the hotel experience for you.
However if breath-taking properties immersed in nature is your thing then this is magic on a full moon night fanned by the paddy field, which produces the hotels delicious red rice. A place that delivers the true orchestra of nature with its colorful dragon fly flitting across the water lily pond, insect singing from the eaves, continual haunting bird song and monkeys calling for us to join in the fun of the jungle setting as they swing from tree to tree. The conductor of these amazing daily experiences is none other than Prabhath Head Butler of KB (Jetwing Kurulubedda), who is often mistaken as a general manager due to his incredible service levels and ability to day after day deliver unforgettable trips with his team that want people to return often to this very special place. In fact the day we stayed on the 7th they had reached number 7 in Galle on Trip Advisor , which is not easy when there are several hundred other places to stay in the area. I am sure by the time we next go it will be number one!
Realizing my passion for both adventure and knowledge he set up a boat safari with local eco expert of twenty years Krishan at 6am. This was to be an unforgettable eco river boat experience as not only did we see loads of birds at sunrise, which is when they are the most active but also learnt first hand about the true village life and culture of the area. This trip can be done again in the evening at 4pm with Krishan or his father or grandfather to enjoy the sunset and even a chance to see the local one-meter rare river crocodiles. In fact they have been working with the Lighthouse Hotel since it was built so service is everything to this river family that live with nature and therefore make wonderful teachers of it.
In addition to being the best guided river trip due to Krishan studying bird life in Colombo and growing up with his family along the banks of the river it was also the most memorable with all the amazing things he would do or explain. For example hearing it was my birthday he turned the national flower, the blue water lily into the most stunning necklace by cleverly snapping the stem in sections and making a loop around it the result was the best gift I have ever been given. They also showed me many secrets like the wild hibiscus, which is mountain yellow in the morning and by evening it has turned into a fiery red colour. I learn how the incredible iconic Sri Lankan masks are made from the Balsa wood trees in the area, due to being soft wood when cut it acts like clay so you can carve it and then dry it out in the sun before painting it with natural forest dyes the following day.
A Hobbit look
On the trip you can see ten different types of lizards and a chameleon that changed its colour as it moved through the undergrowth, and even a catfish living near the hotel in the evening if you are lucky. My favorite birds were the little black cormorants that followed the boat diving and catching small fish that wiggled in their mouths as they followed behind us enjoying how the swirl of the boat made catching fish all the more easy.
If you stay long enough Prabhath the wizard of Jetwing Kurulubedda will reveal many more fascinating secrets about his hometown Galle, with special trips to the UNESCO World Heritage Site Galle Fort, or organise more fun jungle river experiences like catching your own fish and cooking it. He loves the garden as much as his team who try to serve as many home grown things as possible. In fact keeping it natural is their motto, so that even the welcome drink is from the home garden trees. I had no idea that this area has 17 different varieties of mangroves and between serving you the most delicious meals either in the tree house or by the aquamarine pool Prabhath will be telling you other unforgettable stories.
Over the couple of days I stayed being indulged in my every whim and fancy I learn that there are sixty types of birds to be found here, hence the name of Jetwing Kurulubedda, which means birds jungle paradise, of which 20 are migrant birds, and best seen in January and February. Splashes of colour from purple lotus at the entrance and floating on the village style pond reminds one of a Monet painting it is so picture perfect and idyllic in this jungle setting. A short ten minute trip from the old city of Galle Fort and fifteen minute boat ride complimentary to Jetwing Lighthouse, where you can enjoy many facilities from Bridgette Jones style gym to get you looking your best and a SPA, where indulgence is their philosophy, which they more than live up to. For something more personal KB has an on site masseurs table which allows for relaxing room treatments.
Sitting under a Kaduru fruit tree used to make ornaments by the main pool enjoying sumptuous fish lunch in one of four special jungle options for fine dinning. Each spot is special ranging from your own personal lounge balcony platform in the trees for a tete a tete tea honeymoon couple dinner, where you can combine a three-course romantic meal with a spot of bird watching. For special occasions like anniversaries and birthdays you can enjoy dinner in the 2 metre teak tree house overlooking the river with hand made furniture made from the gnarled roots of old trees giving it a Hobbit look, lit by coconut shells and kerosene lamps, which you can access along the wooden teak planked pathway to the boat docking yard.
Most people choose the main dinning area set on a platoon made from natural fibres called Ilk. Besides the laughter of passing village children on their singer bikes, one or two boats on the Kepu river sounds are mostly buzz of insects or the song of the king fisher.
Mostly honeymoon couples enjoy two plunge pool villas as they are totally surrounded by jungle and much more private set away from the main quad of four villa suite rooms. The types of people that love this private location are the younger generation that love privacy and indulging in nature. Being artistic Prabhath will decorate your room for special occasions with flowers and even pull birthday cakes out of a hat despite no pre-warnings. So go on enjoy some jungle luxury and book a few nights through www.jetwinghotels.com and Prabhath and his amazing team will take care of the rest.
