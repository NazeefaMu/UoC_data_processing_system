Online mug shot for new NICs

The Persons Registration Department will introduce an online system for National Identity Card photos as NIC photos should comply with International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) regulations.
The first phase of the programme will commence from the Western and Sabaragamuwa provinces. Accordingly from December 17, people of these two provinces should take photos under the ICAO regulations. Under the new regulations, a hard copy will not be given to the persons posing for the NIC photos.
Instead of a hard copy, the studio will issue a Photophilic Reference Slip (PRS) that has a QR code to the applicant taking the NIC photo.The photo is valid only for six months from the date it is taken at the studio.
The applicant should hand over his NIC application along with the PRS to the Grama Niladhari.
People should take photos only from the studios registered with the Persons Registration Department.
The list of registered studios can be obtained from the area GN or from the Divisional Secretariat office. Besides, persons can get the name list of registered studios by logging on the Persons Registration Department website www.drp.gov.lk.
