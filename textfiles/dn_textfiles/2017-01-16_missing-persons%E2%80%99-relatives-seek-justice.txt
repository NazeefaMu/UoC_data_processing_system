Missing persons’ relatives seek justice

Missing Persons’ Relatives Association members held a demonstration opposite the Eastern Province Governor’s Office in Trincomalee on Saturday, protesting against the government’s alleged failure to mete out justice to persons died or went missing due to the war.
They called off the protest after handing over a petition to the Governor’s Secretary G.G. Muralidaran to be forwarded to the governor.
