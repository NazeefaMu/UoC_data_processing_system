Rice prices reduced

Sri Lanka’s largest rice producers have agreed to slash rice prices in support of the government’s efforts to provide relief to local consumers, Agriculture Minister Mahinda Amaraweera said.
The rice producers, after in-depth discussions with the Minister, agreed to reduce the price of rice by Rs.10 per kilo and mark this price reduction on their rice packs.
Minister Amaraweera further discussed about paddy purchasing in the Yala season and about the measures taken to make the 2018 Maha season, a successful cultivation season.
