Trinity Demolish DSS 65-0

 
 
Trinity College Kandy totally outclassed D.S. Senanayake College recording a smashing 65 points (11 tries, 5 conversions) to nil victory in their Singer inter-school Under-20 Division 1 league rugby tournament match worked off at Longden Place yesterday. Trinity led 22-nil at the breather.
Trinity are known for their power, but for the first time this season they produced one of the finest passing-rugby scoring some spectacular tries in a match where they even sent in a few of their junior members in the second half to have a go at the tiring D.S. Senanayake outfit.
The high-riding Trinitians were hot favourites to win on paper, but actually it was the school from Borella that dominated proceedings for the first 25 minutes. They held the formidable Trinitians to a nil-all scoreline until winger Ayesha Edirisinghe collected the ball and sprinted his way over for a superb try covering nearly 60 metres. Full back Sanushka Abeywickrema failed with the conversion and Trinity went into a 5-nil lead.
Trinity forwards have been magnificent this season, setting up so many tries off the rolling maul, but yesterday was different; it was nothing but the effect of their coach Irish international Erick Miller that the lads from the hill capital were moving the ball so beautifully. Centre three quarter Avishka Shiek, playing his first season under the Trinity jersey got onto the field and scored three breathtaking tries. He gave a fabulous off load to his winger to open the score for his side before clearing over 60 metres on the right wing after receiving the ball from Abeywickrama to score his second on the stroke of half time. Later in the second half he set up Abeywickrema on the right flank, which was another scintillating try where the Trinity duo exchanged the ball twice fooling four or five DSS defenders. Shiek was probably the man of the match.
Despite the margin of win, the match was far from being one-sided. DSS kept it difficult for Trinitians for most of the 80 minutes, but were punished on the small mistakes they made. Perhaps DSS were a bit too worried about Shiek. The boys from DSS did fail to mark the Trinity centre and hence they created some gaps in their defence. Shiek hit those gaps very well to score a hat-trick.
Trinity got into the act in the second half and scored tries through Abeywickrema, Amith Kulatunga, Kanesha Alwis, H.K. Sanghasinghe, Salindra Alahakoon, Melan Maleish and Rishane Madena with Abeywickrema putting over five conversions to make the final score a runaway 65-0. - WAI
