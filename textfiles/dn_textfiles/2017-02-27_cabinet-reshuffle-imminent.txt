Cabinet reshuffle imminent

A Cabinet reshuffle is imminent after the scheduled visit of International Monetary Fund (IMF) Chief Christine Lagarde next month, a highly placed Government source said.
IMF Managing Director Lagarde is expected in the country early March and the Sri Lankan Government will present her a proposal for economic development. The Cabinet reshuffle will take place after her visit, sources said.
Meanwhile, Finance Ministry Secretary Dr R H S Samaratunga told the Daily News yesterday that Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayake along with senior officials of the Treasury held a discussion with the visiting IMF delegation on Friday. The IMF facilitated an Extended Fund Facility of USD 1.5 billion for Sri Lanka mid last year to support the depleting balance of payment. The country received its first tranche last year.
“This is a three year programme and IMF is conducting periodic reviews. We, on the part of the Treasury, briefed them on the fiscal sector of the country as to how we are going to manage the budget deficit and related matters. The ongoing computerization programme of the Inland Revenue Department and the current status of Value Added Tax (VAT) were also explained. How to improve the performances of state owned institutions such as the Sri Lankan Airlines, National Water Supply and Drainage Board, Ceylon Electricity Board and Ceylon Petroleum Corporation were also discussed. The requirement is to get them at least to the break-even level of performance” he said.
He said the visiting IMF delegation would hold several rounds of discussions with various stakeholders including the Central Bank in the coming days.
