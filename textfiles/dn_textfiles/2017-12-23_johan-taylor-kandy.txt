KANDY SPORTS ROUND UP:
Johan Taylor in Kandy

One of the most experienced coaches Johan Taylor who coached Kandy SC to win the league, knockouts and the sevens many times, with his expert coaching arrived last week to continue his stint with the champion team for about a month. He also coached the national side. It was in 2006, when Kandy was looking for a professional rugby coach that the name of Dan van Zale, the former South African scrum-half and captain in 2000 was proposed and agreed upon, but he was offered the National U20 rugby coach for Ireland and had to decline Sri Lanka's offer. Taylor first came at the end of 2006 and coached the team from 2007 for six years and guided Kandy to win both the knockout and league title for five years. The rugby's double eluded them in 2012. His absence as coach was felt badly. Taylor is a fine coach who has coached the Sri Lanka team as well as Royal College in 2013. He played most of his rugby in Ireland after leaving South Africa. Besides he is a Level 3 qualified rugby coach. He is also a very good golfer winning many awards in golf tournaments conducted by the Victoria Golf and Country Resort.

Kandy AFL AGM still not held
Eight days more for the year to end and still the Annual General Meeting of the Kandy Association Football League has not been held. No domestic tournaments, no promotion of the game, only coaching programs are held for a few to earn a quick buck. In the last eight years football has gone to the dogs at club level in Kandy. This has been a great setback for the sport. It is reliably understood even last year’s tournaments have not been held.

This development and intensive 2-day Player Development Camps will bring into focus some of the leading coaches who will train you to gain your full potential using tools to continue your development.

Indrajith Bandaranayake here on holiday

He is a former Dharmaraja College, Kandy SC wing three quarter who is domiciled in Melbourne. As a schoolboy he did well in cricket and karate too. It was at Nittawela he blossomed as a ruggerite. After hanging up his boots he helped his club in coaching in 2005 when Sanjeewa Jayasinghe led the side, and the rugby chairman was Siva Subramanium.
Gearing for inter-school cricket
Kandy schools are gearing up for the cricket amid many hardships and have played a few games. Cricket plays a large part in the lives of school children. At present most cricket playing schools in Kandy are lacking ground facilities and other needs. Spectator interest for school cricket in Kandy is very high. With the help of the spectator’s backing the cricketers too are compelled to produce their best. St. Sylvester’s College has continued to produce good cricketers even without a proper playing field of their own. Vidyartha College is another leading Buddhist school who do not have a ground for matches. Cricket takes pride of place at Kingswood College, another school without a match ground. Dharmaraja, one of the oldest Buddhist cricket playing schools, Trinity College and St. Anthony’s College have their own playing fields, Sri Rahula College has become a major force in cricket with limited facilities, Sri Sumangala College too have ground problems. Nugawela Central College are blessed with a ground, Ranabima Royal College is new to cricket and they have their own grounds. Other schools involved in cricket are Madena Central College, Walala A Ratnayake Central College, Al-Azhar College, Akurana and Zahira College Akurana.
Volleyball 76 years old in Kandy
The game of volleyball is the national sport of Sri Lanka. In Kandy at one time volleyball was a popular sport, but today sadly the much needed support for the game is missing. If the proper backing is there, this game too, could be making big news. The first volleyball league was formed in Kandy in 1941. At one time there were two tournaments annually - one on a league basis and other on a knockout. Volleyball in Kandy needs a fillip. The game was introduced to Sri Lanka (then Ceylon) in 1916 by R. W. Camack, then Director of Physical Education at the Colombo Y.M.C.A. The newly appointed governing body should give a hand for Kandy volleyball.
Rajans junior cricket
Dharmaraja under 13 A team playing In Division 1 lost their first game in the second round to Joseph Vaz, Wennappuwa. Dharmaraja scored 110-8 in 55 overs with Yasith Dissanayake scoring 33. Joseph Vaz replied with 184-3 in 43 overs with Kavith Sehara scoring 70 not out. Menusha Perera 34, and Nethmal de Soyza 33.
Trinity, Dharmaraja win at hockey
Trinity College playing in Group “J” won the “Golden Star” award at the under 14 all island inter school hockey tournament held in Kandy. This was their third win in a row. Trinitians beat Janadapathi Vidyalaya, S. Thomas’ College Gurutalawa, Mahinda College and drew with D.S. Senanayake College. Dharmaraja College who won three games beat schools like Asoka Vidyalaya Colombo, Hindu College Colombo, Badulla Central College and ended up as the group leaders.
