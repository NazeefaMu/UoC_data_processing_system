SL scientist invents portable biogas  plant for waste management

Sri Lankan Scientist Srimal Tissera has invented a compact portable biogas plant,which will be distributed to the local market from July 1.
The pollution-free and environment-friendly biogas plant has been manufactured by using local raw materials and natural technology.
Speaking to Daily News Business Scientist Tissera said the plantis manufactured for the benefit of households, hotels, hospitals, schools, factories and similar institutions to dump their daily waste and thereafter to generate gas for cooking purposes.
He said even the places such as Sri Lanka Army, Navy, Air Force and Police quarters where huge amount of organic waste collect every day could use this environment-friendly biogas plant.
According to Tissera about two kilograms (domestic -0.5 CBM) kitchen waste, fruit waste, coconut refuse, vegetables, and garden waste and hotel oil waste, paper pulp, water hyacinth (Japan Jabara) or salvenia takes six hours to complete reduction into waste.
He said during his research he also developed a high-calorie digestible anaerobic bacterial inoculums accelerator with local raw materials using native medicine to enhance the anaerobic bacteria production and the efficiencies of digestion process.
“Before manufacturing this biogas plant I gained the knowledge through trial and error methods by visiting biogas plants in many countries,” he said.

Tissera also highlighted the difference between his biogas plant and other biogas systems, commonly used in Sri Lanka and said hedeveloped it with high-calorie digestible microbes inoculum accelerator which can even convert low-calorie digestible microbes to high-calorie digestible microbes using various native medicine to maintain the pH values.
“As an experimental project, I first introduced few domestic and industrial green gas plants and installed them at several places,” he said
He said this biogas plant operates efficiently for a long period with minimum operational and maintenance work.
“In addition, I have also developed a high-calorie digestible inocu-accelerator to produce more biogas and active organic liquid fertilizer with less organic waste and it also became very successful,” he said.
According to Tissera, a 5000 Lt (5 CBM) plant (industrial) requires only 10 to 15 kg of organic waste a day to produce 2 -3kg Bio gas and 100 liters of liquid organic Fertilizer.
The plants should be placed strategically to fall sunlight on them and allow the temperature of about 25 C to over 40 C. The higher temperature coupled with the microbes make the Active household or any orgaLiquid Organic Fertilizer and the Bio Gas generation process is extremely efficient.
He said the Bio Gas Plant is Environmental Friendly and Long lasting and therefore it will be an asset to any organization or household and the Bio gas also produces Liquid compost fertilizer.
The plant consist a very simple technology which produces Bio Gas and liquid compost fertilizer with mere organic waste which has been a menace to the Environment.
He further said he needs to see this concept being beneficial to the nation as biogas is an invaluable and long lasting technology which produce a clean fuel and high quality organic fertilizer with mere organic waste which is freely available.
He said he also provided some plants to few schools with the approval of the Ministry of Education for students who study Bio Technology Education.
He also mentioned that many seminars were organized in schools to educate students on this Bio Gas plant and an exhibition was also held at Peradeniya Central College, Kandy.
-“The plant can produce about six to seven hours of gas a day, ”.
