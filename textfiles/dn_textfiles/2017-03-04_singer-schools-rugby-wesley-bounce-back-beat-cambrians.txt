Weight and experience brought the Antonians team victory their three-quarters were far superior to the opponents in attack. Their fly half, made plenty of openings for his line, but the insides were a little slow. The D.S. lads put up a spirited display, but their back division failed to make up due to poor running, the line outs and scrums were evenly shared.
