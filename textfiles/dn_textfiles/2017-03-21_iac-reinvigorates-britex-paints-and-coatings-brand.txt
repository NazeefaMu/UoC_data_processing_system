IAC reinvigorates Britex  paints and coatings brand

Industrial Asphalts (Ceylon) (IAC), a leading company well reputed for its bitumen based products and a wide range of paints and coatings owning many prestigious brands, has undertaken to reinvigorate one of its main brands Britex.
The premier full range of colour anti-corrosive and general purpose metal coatings, trusted by generations for more than 50 years of continuous presence in the market.
Britex is the only coating that gives its revered customers the 3-in-1 benefits of primer, undercoat and topcoat thus saving two-third the cost of their coatings.
Further Britex can also be diluted using Britex Turpentine to give a further advantage of additional coverage of up to 33pct.
The Britex brand has been providing the market with its range of protective coatings for more than 50 years and over the years has earned the trust for delivering high quality that matches and exceeds international standards at very reasonable prices.
“Our continuous commitment to research and development stands at the centre of our business philosophy with many initiatives to enhance and elevate the products we provide to the market. This makes us the ultimate metal paint specialist in the country” quoted the senior management of IAC.
Britex has the full range of associated products giving a full choice in form of standard and range of color anti-corrosive and general-purpose metal coatings, and economy and premium turpentine and thinners.
Britex the trusted brand for over 50 years for heavy-duty domestic and industrial usage
IAC is the pioneer in bitumen based products and protective coatings in Sri Lanka, established in 1964 by a team of Sri Lankans who had the audacious dream of converting what was essentially an area of monopoly by multinational companies. Industrial Asphalts (Ceylon) PLC (CSE code: ASPH) is a publicly listed company, quoted on the Colombo Stock Exchange’s main board.
