Of cakes and bakes

Having discovered the charm if baking Rukshi Neticumara started her venture with baking and soon lured in a fan base. She established Butter Boutique which offers a wide range of cakes and desserts.
Anyone with a sweet tooth will find Butter Boutique a paradise. It does not offer the commonly found and traditional items but keeps up to date with the times and brings sweet delicacies from all over the world within reach of your fingertips.

“What is unique about us is that our cake flavours are different from other places. We have 38 flavours in our cake menu. The Tres Leches is the item which is most in demand. We were the first to introduce it in Sri Lanka. It is a milk cake soaked in a mixture made of three types of milk,” said Ruskshi explained.
She notes that Butter Boutique deals with anything sweet from cinnamon rolls to ice creams, Kulfi and popsicles. Their Salted Caramel Dark Chocolate, double chocolate fudge, Nutella cake and Arabian Night cakes too are hits with the customers.
“I am inspired to bring these products to the menu through my travels,” Rukshi adding that she is self taught. Her mother is a master chef and Rukshi has developed her love for food due to this reason.
“She is always doing something new. Watching her inspired me to try my hand on gastronomy as well and unleash the adventurous side of me,” she said.
She had initially started at the Good Market before moving onto Colombo 3. However Rukshi notes that they are actually seven years old because she has been making the products from home during the early stages.
Queried on what makes a quality cake Rukshi adds that it all comes down to the consistency of the cake.
“You need to include good ingredients to make a quality product. We change our menu every day but we have about 15 different cakes alone each day excluding items like cookies, brownies and cinnamon rolls,” she said adding that she does not wish to venture onto fast food areas like pastries and short eats. Butter Boutique is open from 9.30 am to 7.30 pm on Tuesdays, Wednesdays, Thursdays and Sundays. On Fridays and Saturdays they are open from 9.30 am to 11 pm. Around 25 people can accommodate the shop.
“People from all walks of life come here to fulfill their sweet cravings. We also cater to birthday parties and other festive occasions. However we do not do fondant cakes. If we do structures the whole product has to be made of cake. We do not decorate regiform structures,” she explained. She also pointed out that their coffee which is called Niccolo Coffee is brought down from Melbourne. “My partner, Karl Perera, came up with the name which turned out to be luck for me because now I have my own signature range,” Rukshi noted. Asked about health issues which arise in consuming too much sweet items and Rukshi says that you cannot compromise with the ingredients of the cake to cater to those needs.
“We do eggless items but not sugarless cakes. It is good to indulge in sweets to fulfill your cravings. Just know your limit and you will be fine,” she added with a smile.
