SL, Thailand affirm commitment to bilateral cooperation

The Fourth Meeting of the Sri Lanka-Thailand Bilateral Political Consultations was held on February 27-28, in Colombo at a senior official level.
The Sri Lanka delegation was led by Foreign Secretary Prasad Kariyawasam and the Thai delegation was headed by Thai Foreign Affairs Ministry Permanent Secretary Busaya Mathelin. Sri Lanka and Thailand reaffirmed the commitment to further consolidate and advance bilateral political and economic cooperation.
A wide range of matters in areas of mutual collaboration and ongoing programmes in agriculture, fisheries, science and technology, trade and investment, culture and tourism were reviewed and discussed.
In particular, the possibility of utilising rain-making technology in Sri Lanka and convening the Fourth Joint Commission on Technical and Economic Cooperation and Third Joint Agricultural Working Group between Sri Lanka and Thailand were discussed.
The two sides stressed the importance of continuing to work together at regional and multilateral forums to advance shared interests and mutually important issues.
Mathelin also called on Foreign Minister Tilak Marapana on February 28.
An MoU between the two countries on May 30, 2012, paved the way for enhancing bilateral cooperation through political consultations. The First Political Consultation between Sri Lanka and Thailand was held in August 2012 in Colombo with the second and third being held in December 2012 and June 2014 in Thailand. Senior officials of the two Foreign Ministries and other line agencies participated.
