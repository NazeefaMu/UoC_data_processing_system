A writ petition filed by the All Island Three Wheeler Drivers’ Union was yesterday withdrawn before the Court of Appeal following the government’s decision to issue new regulations to uplift the three-wheel transport service in the country. The All Island Three Wheeler Drivers’ Union had filed a writ petition seeking an order to direct the authorities to implement and perform according to the terms and provisions of the regulations published in the Government Gazettes bearing Nos.1821/31 dated 31.07.2013 and 1848/29 dated 06.02.2014 and of the provision of section 128a of the Motor Traffic Act No. 14 of 1951.
When the petition was taken up before the Court of Appeal, Justice Vijith K. Malalgoda (President) and S. Thurairaja, the petitioner’s counsel Kanishka Vitharana informed Court that his client has decided to withdraw the petition.
The petition was dismissed accordingly.
In its petition, the petitioner cited the Commissioner General of Motor Traffic, the Transport Minister, Inspector General of Police and seven others as respondents.
The petitioner further sought an order directing the authorities to take criminal action and enforce law against the offenders who act in breach of the concerned regulation.
