PM’s functions curtailed temporarily-GL

 
Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) Chairman Prof. G.L. Peiris said the Court of Appeal Interim Order restraining the functions of the office of the Prime Minister had given a wrong opinion to the people.
He was speaking at a press conference held at the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna office at Nelum Mawatha, Battaramulla yesterday morning.
Prof. Peiris further told the media that after issuing the order, the people are under the impression that currently, the country has no Prime Minister or a Cabinet of Ministers which is not the fact.
“The position of the Prime Minister still prevails and it is only his functions that have been curtailed till the final judgement is delivered,” Prof. Peiris said.
Prof. Peiris further said that Member of Parliament Mahinda Rajapaksa’s post as the Prime Minister still prevails, but the functions and powers relegated to his position is curtailed by the Interim Order.
He also revealed that they will accept the judgement which is to be given by the Suprime Court relating to the dissolution of Parliament.
Prof. Peiris further said the prevailing political situation is something new, not only to Sri Lanka, but to the world.
“This is not a good situation. Ultimately, it is the public which has to suffer. Therefore, the only solution to overcome the current political impasse is to go for a General Election,” Prof. Peiris said.
He further emphasized that MP Mahinda Rajapaksa is a politician who had risen from the grassroots before reaching the zenith of his political career. Therefore, he has no need to fight for positions. He accepted the Prime Minister’s post on the invitation of President Maithripala Sirisena to ensure the wellbeing of the country.
Kalutara District MP Rohitha Abeygunawardana and Sabaragamuwa Provincial Council Chairman Kanchana Jayaratne also spoke.
