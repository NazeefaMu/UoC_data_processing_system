Allergy alert!

A tot allergic to inflatables, apples and even his own tears is a prisoner in his own home - and will never be able to enjoy summer.
Nine-month-old Riley Kinsey, from Kirkby-in-Ashfield, Notts, was born with 50 known allergies and is only able to leave his house once a week because of fears he could have an life-threatening allergic reaction.
The toddler breaks out in a severe red rash if his skin comes into contact with any type of latex – meaning he can never play on bouncy castles, have balloons at his birthday party, go to a children’s ball park or relax on a lilo on holiday.
And the youngster’s sensitive skin is even allergic to his own tears, meaning when he cries his face swells up to double its usual size.
Only able to eat four kinds of food - turkey, carrots, plums and sweet potatoes, Riley has had reactions to almost every household item and foodstuff in mum Kayleigh and dad Michael’s house.
And the family admit relatives even refuse to hold him in case they trigger a dangerous reaction.
Mum Kayleigh, 24, a stay-at-home mum, said that she and Michael, a plasterer, have now been left wondering what kind of life Riley will lead in future.
The mum-of-three said, “It's very hard for my husband and I.
“You can't live your life, you have to wash your hand so many times and make sure everything is clean. We only take him when we have to, no more than once a week. It’s too risky otherwise. He’s become a prisoner in his house because the outside world is so risky for him. If he begins to cry his skin gets irritated even further. It can be quite difficult to deal with as you can't leave him to soothe. You have to go and deal with him straight away. He was quite interested in my daughter's purple inflatable hammer but then we found out he was allergic to that to as his face swelled up.” “We ask ourselves if he’ll able to go to a normal school or even something straightforward like going to a park. It's heartbreaking. It's not nice to see him like this.”
Michael said, "It's very worrying not to know if he'll be able to lead a life where he can be a normal child. It upsets me that he may not be able to go and kick a ball on a field with his friends. This will impact his whole life but also ours. But at the end of the day he's my son and I will deal with whatever I have to as I want the very best for him."
Kayleigh said that the weeks following her son’s birth were normal enough with no complications.
Then, at six weeks old, Riley began to develop eczema on his head.
Kayleigh said, “The back of his head started weeping so naturally we took him to the doctor who gave him some cream to try. It was like he’d tipped acid over him, it had absolutely no impact at all and made it worse. The first allergy reaction was in February. He had some baby porridge. Straight away his face started swelling and he was really unsettled and started crying. It's just escalated from there. It’s so distressing.”
Riley has reactions so severe that his face will swell and his body will become covered in terrible sore patches and hives which put him at risk of infection.
Kayleigh said because Riley’s allergies are largely airborne, she and her husband have to operate a strict daily cleaning routine that sees the couple hoover their house from top to bottom.
They have to be so careful about Riley’s condition, the family even have to avoid eating in certain rooms in the house in case Riley should enter them.
And heartbreakingly, Riley is also unable to play with his sisters Georgea, four, and Taylor Mae, two.
Kayleigh and Michael have even been forced to spend £5,000 on re-carpeting their entire home and are facing the prospect of having to add an extension to their home.
Kayleigh said, “He gets hives across his body and will cry out in pain. It leads to lots of sleepless nights because he wakes himself up scratching in his sleep. There have been times when we’ve found that he’s scratched himself red raw with blood all over him. Riley has his meals on his own and not with his sisters or the rest of the family. We eat in the kitchen but Riley eats in the living room, so the food is kept away from him. We’re struggling to find places to put his food in a sterile environment so we need extra space. We have to wash his clothes separately as well as his bowls and spoons.”
Kayleigh and Michael both said, “Everyone has done what they can, but we've had a couple of family members refuse to hold him. All we get is people asking 'how do you cope' but at the end of the day you have two choices. Do you walk away or get on with it? We choose to get on with it because he's our son.He's a very happy child. He smiles every day and just gets on with it."
