Rs. 100 mn garment factory for Trincomalee

Construction of the garment factory at Seethanaveli in Muttur DS division in the Trincomalee district is nearing completion.
The factory is being constructed at an estimated cost of Rs.100 million, jointly sponsored by the Eastern Provincial Council and Hameedia Real Men's Wear at the request of Eastern Province Chief Minister Haafis Nazeer Ahamed.
Chief Minister Ahamed visited the building complex site recently and had discussions with officials involved in the project.
The garment factory will open on June 30, Eastern Province Chief Ministry Secretary U.L.A. Azees said.
The factory will provide employment opportunities for a good number of youngsters from the Trincomalee district, sources said.
This garment factory is the second in the Eastern Province to open after the introduction of good governance policies. The people of the province are thankful to President Maithripala Sirisena for this project.
The first factory was opened at the Eravur DS division in the Batticaloa district by President Sirisena last year.
Construction of another garment factory at Sammanthurai in the Ampara district is underway and will be completed very soon.
