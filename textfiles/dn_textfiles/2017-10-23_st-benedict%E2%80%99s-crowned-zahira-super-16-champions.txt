The final between St. Benedict’s and Hameed Al Hussainie got off to a flying start as St. Benedict’s players controlled the game effectively. But there forwards were lacking shooting power.
As game went on in the 22nd minute Hameed Al Hussainie were awarded a penalty for a handball inside the box. But the kick by M. Musheed was well saved by Ben’s custodian who dived to his left to stop the ball.
