Photographic puzzle unlocked

An extraordinary picture taken in 1948 by David ‘Chim' Seymour, one of Magnum Photos' co-founders, has since been seen by millions: first, it was published in LIFE magazine where the caption read in part “Children's wounds are not all outward. Those made in the mind by years of sorrow will take years to heal." Then it was selected by Edward Steichen for his legendary exhibition The Family of Man. This image of Tereska drawing her home has fascinated many and has become emblematic of World War II.
In the Spring of 1948, when Chim was sent by UNICEF as a special correspondent to report on children in five European countries, 13 million children of Europe had survived World War II. They were homeless and orphans, many of them physically wounded as well as mentally traumatized. As a new retrospective of Chim's photographs opens in Israel at Tel Aviv's Beit Hatfutsot Museum, it seems like a perfect time in history to take a new look at Tereska's picture.
In a school for “backward and psychologically upset children,” as Chim states in his story's captions, Tereska, then seven or eight years old, is standing in front of a blackboard. As we see in Chim's contact sheets from a pinned notice on the blackboard, the teachers' assignment was ‘To jest dom”- “This is home”.
That is what children were supposed to draw, but Tereska could only trace in chalk a tangle of frantic lines. Her haunted eyes reflect her confusion and anguish. Tereska's identity has remained a mystery for almost 70 years.
Initiated by Gregor Siebenkotten, director of the Tereska Foundation, a thorough research on Tereska has just been carried by Patryk Graewicz, a Polish researcher, and Aneta Wawrzyczak, a human-rights journalist. Matthew Murphy, an editor at Magnum Photos's New York office and myself assisted them from this end with information on Chim's life history and archive.
Early in September 1948, Chim arrived in Poland, his native country and the last he visited on his mission (after Italy, Greece, Austria and Hungary). He had found out that his parents and most of his family has been killed by the Nazis.
After traveling to Otwock, 25 miles from the capital, where he summered as a child, he went back to Warsaw, where he photographed the ruins of the Jewish ghetto and children on Stawki Street. They were walking home from their school, the only building that had not been razed during the Warsaw bombings.
The captions and contact sheets of his story on Polish children, shot with both 35mm and Rolleiflex, let us follow the photographer on a mid-September morning of 1948. Chim first photographed at the Legia Warszawa soccer stadium, then walked among Warsaw's ruins, shooting on the way. He chanced upon a group of schoolchildren pushing wheelbarrows full of rubble, and he followed them, finding several other children working on their garden plot as occupational therapy. He photographed children from the same school standing in front of a group of buildings.
