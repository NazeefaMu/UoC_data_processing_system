Mihintale to get new power system before next Poson

Poson Full Moon Poya Day Lake House Mihintale Aloka Pooja was switched on by Power and Renewable Energy Minister Ranjith Siyambalapitiya with Ministers Duminda Dissanayake and Chandrani Bandara amidst seth pirith chanting by the Maha Sangha headed by Mihintale Raja Maha Viharadhipathi Ven Valawahangunawewa Dhammarathana Nayaka Thera.
Minister Ranjith Siyambalapitiya said he instructed the CEB management to take action to replace the present 15 –year-old Mihintale electricity system with an advanced power supply mechanism before next Poson.
He added that Mihintale is the place where the greatest religious revolution took place; a revolution sans bloodshed, violence or destruction, making the country civilized and spiritually advanced, with the endowment of Buddhism by Arahat Mahinda. He lauded the Founder of Lake House late D. R. Wijewardana, his heirs and the Lake House Management for the contribution to make the Aloka Pooja a reality.
In his anusasana, the Prelate said that historic Mihinthale was the only place in the world where an army of 40,000 including the king of the country dropped their weapons brought in to hunt deer, and took to the path of non-violence and compassion, inspired by Arahat Mahinda and the Buddhist entourage from India.
