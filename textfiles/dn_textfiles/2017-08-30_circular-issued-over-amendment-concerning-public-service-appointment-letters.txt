Circular issued over amendment concerning public service appointment letters

The Public Administration and Management Ministry has issued a circular over an amendment concerning the appointment letters made to the public service since January 1, 2016, over their pensions scheme.
The Ministry pointed out that as the budget proposal for 2016 had pledged to introduce a new pensions scheme for the public servants, the circular had it that the pensions scheme for the public servants appointed since 2016 would be changed in future according to the Government policy in that respect.
However, the Ministry pointed out that the Government had not so far reached its policy over the pension scheme for the newly appointed members of the public service.
The Cabinet of Ministers had approved on August 15 that until the government reaches a policy decision, Clause Six of the members of the public service appointed since January 1, 2016 should be amended as that they would be bound by the policy decision that is to be taken in future. It also said that the new entrants are entitled to a pension and they have to make their contributions to the pension and the Widows' and Orphans' Pension Fund.
The Ministry had made this amendment with the approval of the Public Service Commission.
