Abandoned

A mother and daughter are seen in the Moratuwa town and suburbs walking from morning to evening begging. The daughter can hardly walk without the mother’s help. They have no place to call “home”. Philanthropists and social welfare associations are requested by the concerned in the area to provide them with a permanent shelter and a livelihood avenue.
