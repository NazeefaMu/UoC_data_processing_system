Promising ayurvedic remedies for kidney patients

The North Central Ayurveda Department has embarked on a healthcare programme for curing kidney patients using native drugs and treatment methodology.
Referring to the venture, North Central Ayurveda Commissioner Dr. Kumara Alwis told the Daily News that based on around six ancient indigenous prescriptions possessed by the late Gonagaldeniya Chittharamadipathi Ven. Waharaka Abayarathanalankara Nayaka Thera, the manufacturing of prescribed native drug packages is being commenced at the provincial ayurveda drugs manufacturing plant at Thelhiriyawa, Thambuttegama.
These indigenous prescriptions were donated by Dr. Nishanta Kumarasinghe, a senior lecturer at the Kothelawala Defence University and he himself is native of Kahatagasdigiliya in Rajarata to whom the prescriptions had been handed over in good faith by the prelate, for saving kidney patients.
It has been proven that these native drug packages are able to cure kidney diseases, after being tested at the kidney diseases treatment integrated clinic run by a team of western and ayurvedic doctors together. Results are most positive and encouraging.
The North Central Ayurveda Department has entrusted the manufacturing task of the said range of native drug packages to the provincial ayurveda drug manufacturing plant located at Thelhiriyawa in Thambuttegama, Dr. Alwis said.
"I appeal to the public to supply us raw herbs such as 'wal del' (wild breadfruit) roots, 'midella barks,' 'karamba leaves,' 'na' dalu (tender leaves), 'kalanduru ala' and 'pokuru wada,' as a meritorious deed to enable us to carry on with the kidney patients programme," Dr. Alwis added.
Herbal ingredients could be handed over to Anuradhapura Provincial Ayurveda Commissioner's office (TP: 025 2229357/58) or Thelhiriyawa drugs manufacturing plant (TP: 025 2056789).
