Policeman killed in Iran protests

IRAN: Fresh protests broke out as night fell in Iran Monday with reports of a policeman shot dead, as the authorities moved to crack down on days of unrest across the country.
There was a heavy police presence in Tehran as small groups of protesters ran through the city centre shouting anti-regime slogans, local agencies reported.
Some arrests were made before calm returned to the capital, reports said.
State television said one policeman had been killed and three others wounded by fire from hunting rifles in the city of Najafabad in central Iran.
The latest demonstrations came despite President Hassan Rouhani’s vow that the nation would deal with “rioters and lawbreakers”.
Media cited Ali Shamkhani, secretary of Iran’s Supreme National Security Council, as blaming the violence on social media.
“Hashtags and messages about the situation in Iran come from the United States, Britain and Saudi Arabia,” he said.
“What is happening on social networks concerning the situation in the country is a proxy war against the Iranian people.”
US President Donald Trump, who has repeatedly criticised Tehran over four days of demonstrations, said it was “time for a change” and that Iran’s people were “hungry” for freedom.
Iran’s intelligence ministry released a statement saying “rioters and instigators” have been identified “and will be dealt with seriously soon”.
The Revolutionary Guards published photos of three wanted people and called on the public to report any “seditionist elements”.
The deadliest night yet was on Sunday, with state television reporting six people killed by gunfire in the western town of Tuyserkan, and a local lawmaker saying two people had been shot dead in the southwestern town of Izeh.
Two others, including a teenage boy, were run down and killed by a fire engine protesters stole in the western town of Dorud, the state broadcaster said. The total death toll linked to the protests currently stands at 13. Rouhani tried to play down the unrest, which began in second city Mashhad last Thursday and quickly spread across the country to become the biggest test for the regime since mass protests in 2009.
“This is nothing,” Rouhani said in a statement on the presidency website. “Our nation will deal with this minority who chant slogans against the law and people’s wishes, and insult the sanctities and values of the revolution.”
Pro-regime rallies were held across several towns and cities.
Reporting restrictions remained tight, but videos on social media showed seemingly widespread anti-government protests, with attacks on government buildings and a school for clergy in the northwestern town of Takestan on Sunday. - AFP
