World’s biggest book sale in  Sri Lanka for the first time

The Big Bad Wolf book sale will be in Sri Lanka from October 5 to 15, 2017. The book sale will be held at the Sri Lanka Exhibition and Convention Centre (SLECC). The event is supported by The Ministry of Education of Sri Lanka.
The launch event held to announce the entry of the sale to Sri Lanka was attended by Big Bad Wolf Books Founder and Managing Director, Andrew Yap and Local Director of ProRead Lanka (Pvt) Ltd. Nishan Wasalathanthri.
The highlight of the Big Bad Wolf Book Sale is that the sale will be open 24 hours a day, providing book enthusiasts the opportunity to shop non-stop for 11 consecutive days.
This would mean 255 hours from the moment the Sale opens its doors. Book lovers of all ages will get the opportunity to shop to their hearts’ content without having to worry about time.
The mega book sale will also offer an array of amazing deals, which include significant discounts between 60% and 80% on brand-new, high-quality English language books that will be on sale to the public. The aim of a book sale of this scale and nature is to make good books available at an affordable price, allowing the general public to purchase books at the best prices. It will also contribute towards raising readership rates, increasing awareness on the value of books and improving English proficiency amongst Sri Lankans.
The sale brings together a variety of books and collectibles under one roof, making them more accessible at unbeatable prices. It will include over 1.5 million books, covering 20,000 high-end English titles from various genres such as biographies, novels, non-fiction and fiction, literature, coffee table books, cookbooks, children’s books and educational books for children of all ages which are perfect for new parents and teachers and more.
The sale will also be an ideal venue for limited edition and rare book collectors, whilst providing a space for suppliers of local bookshops, DVD and Blu-Ray movie stalls.
Sharing his thoughts, Nishan Wasalathanthri, Director of ProRead Lanka (Pvt) Ltd. said, "We are excited about the opportunities that the Big Bad Wolf Book Sale can offer avid Sri Lankan readers and parents. From the very beginning, we identified the need for a book sale of this nature in Sri Lanka, and we are positive that the visitors to the sale will be delighted with the choice of books available, as well as the many activities that we have lined up to encourage a more knowledge-sharing community."
Commenting on the introduction of the book sale into Sri Lanka, the Malaysian Partner of Big Bad Wolf Books Dipak Madhavan said, “As someone who deeply believes in the importance of developing skills in English, we decided to bring the Big Bad Wolf to Sri Lanka to provide everyone with an awe-inspiring experience. It’s not just for readers but also for those who would like to come to a family-oriented event; so do drop by and explore what the Big Bad Wolf Book Sale has to offer. The event will no doubt help book lovers, both young and old to expand their curiosity whilst sharing knowledge and will also get them to enjoy learning English in the process.”
