Speak not so loud!

A bench headed by Acting Chief Justice Gita Mittal issued the notice on the PIL filed by social activist Sanjjiiv Kkumaar. Sanjjiiv, in his PIL, traced the advent of all religions in India to say, “Hinduism is 4,000 years old, Jainism is 2,600 years old, Buddhism is 2,500 years old, Christianity is 2,000 years old, Islam is 1,400 years old, Sikhism is 500 years old and on another hand, moving coil current loudspeakers are not even 100 years old. Thus, it’s beyond doubt, and as facts and truth speaks for itself per se, loudspeakers were never a part of any religion”....
“As loudspeakers is not part of/intrinsic to any of the religions as all religions are 4,000 to 500 years old whereas loudspeaker came into existence in 1924, that is less than 100 years and hence, banning them will not violate Article 25 or 26 of the Constitution.
Man’s house is his castle, loudspeakers breach right to be left alone
The petitioner relied heavily on the privacy judgment of the Supreme Court to say that its use is breach of privacy. “Every democratic country sanctifies domestic life; it is expected to give him rest, physical happiness, peace of mind and security. In the last resort, a person’s house, where he lives with his family, is his “castle”; it is his rampart against encroachment on his personal liberty,” it said. It quoted an observation made by Justice DY Chandrachud in the privacy judgment that. “One’s house is like a castle to him. If loudspeakers are encroaching one’s right of spatial control (one’s home), one’s right to left alone, then what’s the meaning of fundamental rights? It will be just on paper.
Hence to protect and uphold the fundamental rights of one’s “left alone”, “personhood (physical and mental peace), spatial control – Loudspeakers need to go”...
Blaring loudspeakers in places of worship
The Calcutta High Court on November 21, 1996 banned the use of loudspeakers at all places of worship, irrespective of religion. A division bench of Justice Bhagabati Prasad Benerjee and Justice A. K. Chakraborty in their ruling stated that as India is a secular state the ban would cover all religions and steps to control noise pollution should cover all religious communities. The ban which minimised noise levels in the city during the durga-pujas and Kalipujas would also cover gurudwaras and Mosques all over West Bengal.
The Muslim calls for prayer follow the tradition of Jews and Christians where the bell was, and still is, in vogue. While the church bell peeled with the ringer working on the rope connecting the bell hung from the lofty belfry, the Muslim priest exhorts his flock through his sonorous voice praising Allah.
For instance, as noted above, one of the roles of church bell or azan was/is to tell the faithful about the time for prayer or service. That originated at a time when there were no clocks or watches and communities lived in exclusive clusters – like oasis in Arabian deserts. Also, at the time of the origin of azan there were no loudspeakers to amplify the voice.
Today, clocks and watches are widely in vogue. And there are mobiles all over to show time or even to ring an alarm. In the context of noise pollution, bells and prayer calls are great irritants to senior citizens, ailing patients and shift workers catching up on sleep. It applies to temple bells as well, specially as they have no fixed timings and get activated by visiting devotees. One can have symbolic, low decibel bells that please the gods/deities without disturbing irritable humans. Such competitive surrender of irritants can be infectious and lead to sustainable noise pollution control, peace and harmony.
Shouldn’t there be a ban on loudspeakers at religious places?
In March 2016, castigating the practice of using loudspeakers at religious places of various religions, causing noise pollution, the Madras High Court observed, “It appears that these institutions (places of worship of different faiths) perceive that the blessing of God cannot be obtained unless there is loud noise. Prayers for all religions have been going on from ancient time even when electricity did not exist”.
What Law says: Is it legal to use loudspeakers in religious places?
Cases on noise pollution
During the case of Church of God (Full Gospel) in India v. K.K.R. Majestic Colony Welfare Assn, 2000CriLJ4022, The Supreme Court held that the Court may issue directions in respect of controlling noise pollution, even if such noise was a direct result of and was connected with religious activities. It said, “Undisputedly, no religion prescribes that prayers should be performed by disturbing the peace of others nor does it preach that they should be through voice amplifiers or beating of drums. In a civilized society in the name of religion, activities which disturb old or infirm persons, students or children having their sleep in the early hours or during daytime or other persons carrying on other activities cannot be permitted.”
SC in the case of Noise Pollution (V), In re, (2005) 5 SCC 733 (this case has since been reopened) has held as under: “150. Several interlocutory applications have been filed in this Court, wherein it was pleaded that restriction on bursting of firecrackers in the night should be removed during Diwali. Similar relaxation was demanded for other festivals. These applications highlighted practices prevalent in some of the western countries wherein such relaxation is allowed. We don’t think it’s justified to grant any such relaxation. Indian society is pluralistic. People of India belong to different castes and communities and have belief in different religions and celebrate different festivals. We are tolerant of each other. There is unity in diversity. If relaxation is allowed to one there will be no justification for not permitting relaxation to others. If we do so, relaxation will become the rule. It will be difficult to enforce restriction.”
Azaan on loudspeakers is impermissible
The Calcutta High Court has held in the case of Moulana Mufti Syed Mohammed Noorur Rehman Barkati v. State of West Bengal as under: “Accordingly, it cannot be said that for giving Azaans the applicants should be allowed to use microphones in the early hours of the day and that is before 6 o’clock in the morning. Azaan is definitely an integral and essential part of the Muslim religion, but use of microphones is certainly not an integral part of Azaan.”
Right to sleep peacefully is a fundamental right
Maidan Incident (In Re:) the Apex Court dealt with the issue of privacy as a part of Article 21 of the Constitution of India and held that the right to sleep has always been treated to be a fundamental. The Apex Court held thus: “327. Sleep is essential for a human being to maintain the delicate balance of health necessary for its very existence and survival. Sleep is, therefore, a fundamental requirement without which the existence of life would be in peril. To disturb sleep, therefore, would amount to torture, which is now accepted as a violation of human right.”
The law on noise pollution
Rule 5 of the Noise Pollution (Regulation and Control) Rules, 2000 under the Environment (Protection) Act, 1986 read: Restrictions on the use of loudspeakers/public address system:
n A loudspeaker or a public address system shall not be used except after obtaining written permission from the authority.
n A loudspeaker or a public address system shall not be used at night (between 10.00 p.m. to 6.00 a.m.) except in closed premises for communication within, e.g. auditoria, conference rooms, community and banquet halls.
n Notwithstanding anything contained in sub-rule (2), the State Government may, subject to such terms and conditions as are necessary to reduce noise pollution, permit use of loudspeakers or public address systems during night hours (between 10.00 p.m. to 12.00 midnight) on or during any cultural or religious occasion of a limited duration not exceeding 15 days in all during a calendar year.”
These are matters which certainly seek reflection even in our country.
