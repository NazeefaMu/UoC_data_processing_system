Government may shake but will not fall: Rajitha

The government may shake but it will not fall, Co-cabinet Spokesperson, Minister Rajitha Senaratne said, refuting claims of ‘government instability’ at the weekly Cabinet briefing yesterday.
The claims come amidst former President Mahinda Rajapaksa vowing to topple the government in 2017 along with State Minister Priyankara Jayaratne resigning from his post to join the Rajapakse camp.
“Mahinda Rajapaksa made the same promise in 2015 and then in 2016. Nothing happened,” the minister said. Commenting further on remarks made by the Kurunegala MP that the Bodu Bala Sena (BBS) was supported by the opposition; namely Champika Ranawaka and Rajitha Senaratne to defeat him, Minister Senaratne said the BBS was always Gotabhaya Rajapaksa’s puppet and that they worked for him. “It was Gota who asked Anura Senanayake to let the BBS hold the meeting in Aluthgama. He got them to set fire to Aluthgama. Mahinda has always been scared of Gota. I smell a conspiracy here if he says that the BBS supported us. It is Mahinda’s nature to get people to sling mud at him for political advantage. So I am not surprised,” he said.
