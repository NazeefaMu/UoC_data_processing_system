Lanka’s ‘Solar Energy war’ to tackle crisis - President

The International Solar Energy Alliance would be a powerful tool to create a pure and verdant Earth, President Maithripala Sirisena said.
President Sirisena who noted that the Energy crisis had affected not only developed countries, but also developing countries such as Sri Lanka, said the government of Sri Lanka had already launched a project called ‘Solar Energy war’ as a preparation to tackle the problem.
President Sirisena was addressing the inaugural meeting of the International Solar Energy Alliance held at the Rashtrapathi Bhavan, New Delhi, India, last morning.
Under this programme, Sri Lanka envisaged to generate an additional 1,000 megawatts of electricity by 2025.
Apart from this, a programme is underway to set up solar energy stations of 1 to 10 megawatt capacity for the use of small and medium scale industries.
President Sirisena who ensured Sri Lanka’s total support and dedication to Summit meetings of this nature, highly appreciated the leadership offered by the French President and the Indian Prime Minister to hold the Solar Energy Alliance Summit.
A press release by the President’s Media Unit said the Solar Energy Alliance meeting was aimed to hold discussions on fulfilling energy needs, improve solar energy technology minimising the cost outlay of Solar Energy Projects.
President Sirisena was among a host of world leaders and state officials attending this summit jointly organised by Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and French President Emmanuel Macron.
