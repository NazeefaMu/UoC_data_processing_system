Mutual musical musings

Resonance is all about dreams, memories, authenticity and energy. These are a group of Familians who go back a long way. Melodies speaks to Judith Fernando on Resonance, a relatively new choir group who are always looking to take it to the next level.
Passionate about music, these girls are very talented and though they have many obligations, they never forget what initially brought them together – music.
“We’re a group of talented and super passionate girls whose mutual musical roots go back to non other than Holy Family Convent, Bambalapitiya, where we all sang together at some point for roughly 8 years, under the guidance of our Choral Directress Rapti Fernando,” said Fernando.
Although competing for The Asia Pacific Choir Games in 2017 was what initially brought them together, creating and performing together was always the focal point.
“We all met at HFC but, after leaving school our lives obviously took us down different paths. Individually, we’re all from different backgrounds. Our interests, purposes and careers differ so much but, one thing we all have in common is the unwavering Love for Music. Which is the main reason we all decided to create Resonance,” explained Fernando.
A little rusty after having been away from singing, because of many obligations, the girls soon clicked and soon gained momentum.
“Getting back in vocal shape was one. Many of us had not been practicing or singing after leaving school so we had to get down to basic training and keep pushing ourselves to raise the bar, constantly keeping the momentum despite having so many other obligations towards family, work and studies. It’s all paying off though, because we’re sounding our best yet at the moment,” pointed out Fernando.
The group soon made a name for themselves and started to enjoy success. They have achieved recognition in a short while.
“Our passion for Music has “resonated” with many so far. We’ve been approached to perform and sing for a number of exclusive events and weddings within the past year and the response has been great. We’re humbled and inspired! Though a relatively new choir, many have heard about us and associate our performances to the various genres of singing & the collaboration of dancing that we do,” added Fernando.
Versatile and enthusiastic they are not limited to one genre. They just love music overall and consider it something worth pursuing.
“We don’t have a label or fixed genre. Our girls are multi-talented and are interested in various genres spanning from Pop, hip hop, show, gospel to Jazz and Metal. Some of our girls are trained Musicians, some are professional singers with experience in performing in theatre and we even have the country’s first female Metal Soloist. The choir mostly sings in four part harmony so, we’re proud to say we love to create our own, unique renditions of songs. But, maybe we’ll make a few of our own in the future,” explained Fernando.
Fernando stated that the goal is to use their talents to resonate and make a difference in the music industry.
“As individuals we like to contribute more towards the afore mentioned ambition of Resonance and we accept all Past Familians, depending on their talent in singing. Our message to any young musician trying to come up in the field is -Find ways of enhancing your musical talents. Find people who could be your inspiration and have a passion for something better than what you have already done. Be unique,” said Fernando.
The girls are constantly looking at how to better themselves. They are looking at taking Resonance to a place where they can utilize their full potential.
“Resonance can be booked for weddings and events and we usually have a few gigs a month. We look forward to taking on gigs that come our way because of the new experiences and level of enhancement we make through each of them,” said Fernando.
Inspiration is the first step in the journey. The rest is commitment. And commitment can only be translated into success when you have the energy.
“We’re all individually inspired by different genres but we think it all boils down to the energy, authenticity and feel of a song. All kinds of music could be an inspiration depending on the way it’s sung and the emotion put into making an impact on the listener,” stated Fernando.
The girls are more than capable of writing their own lyrics. They are just looking for the correct time.
“We normally purchase our scores and music depending on the requirement and preference of the girls. We haven’t written any lyrics so far but, we’re sure one of our skillful choristers can jump right into it whenever needed,” summed up Fernando.
