England duo fined after Sri Lanka win

Jason Roy and David Willey have been fined after letting their emotions spill over in England's World Twenty20 win over Sri Lanka. Both players enjoyed strong performances as England sealed a semi-final place with a 10-run win in Delhi, but fell foul of the International Cricket Council's code of conduct. Roy swore after being given out lbw for 42 and threw his bat and helmet as he left the pitch, though television replays did not support his reaction. 
 
Willey, meanwhile, gave a colourful send-off to Milinda Siriwardana when the Sri Lankan batsman was dismissed immediately after hitting the seamer for six. Both men admitted the offences in a meeting with match referee Jeff Crowe, with Roy losing 30 per cent of his match fee and Willey 15 per cent of his. An ICC statement confirmed: " Roy was found to have breached Article 2.1.5 of the ICC Code of Conduct for Players and Player Support Personnel, which relates to "showing dissent at an umpire's decision during an international match".
 
 Roy displayed dissent on two accounts after he was given out leg before in the 13th over (obscene language on being given out and then throwing his bat and helmet as he left the field). "Willey was found guilty of violating Article 2.1.7 of the Code, which relates to: "using language, actions or gestures which disparage or which could provoke an aggressive reaction from a batsman upon his/her dismissal during an international match".
