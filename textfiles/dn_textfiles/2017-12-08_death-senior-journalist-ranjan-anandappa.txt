Death of  senior journalist Ranjan Anandappa

Veteran sports journalist Ranjan Anandappa (69) passed away yesterday after a brief illness.
Anandappa, who had a 30-year career at Lake House, was working for the Sunday Observer at the time of his death. He worked as a journalist for the Sun newspaper from 1984 to 1989.
An old boy of De Mazenod College, Kandana and Ananda College, Colombo, Anandappa was a versatile cricketer who played for the First XI at Ananda College in 1967-68. Among his illustrious classmates at Ananda College were Field Marshal Sarath Fonseka and Health Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne. He joined the Navy after leaving school.
He later became a first class umpire and match official and continued to officiate until very recently. He harnessed his sports knowledge to become one of the country’s leading sports journalists and columnists. In addition to local and international cricket, he covered several other sports including rugby, motor sport and athletics.
Trilingual Anandappa was also a professional singer. He released an album of songs in Sinhala and English to mark the 1996 Cricket World Cup victory. Many of these songs were telecast on local TV channels.
He is survived by wife Christine, a son and a daughter.
