Royal beat Dharmaraja

A drop goal by skipper Ovin Askey in the last moment of the game gave Royal College a hard fought 18 points (1 goal, 1 try, 1 penalty, 1 drop goal) to 15 (1 goal, 1 try, 1 drop goal) win in their Singer inter-school rugby match played at Nittawela yesterday.
In this game rugby football of a type far superior to that played by some of the teams in the current inter-school tournament was witnessed. Both teams rucked drove and powered their way to present good rugby.
Dharmaraja led 15-8 at half time and kept the lead till the last quarter of the game, but failed to continue with the lead.
In the second half the Royalist pressed strongly and gave a good display to overtake the home team’s score.
The outstanding feature of the game apart from Dharmaraja’s inability to drive home their advantage was the splendid ball handling and touch finding of Royal. Most of the kicks put in the shade the efforts of the hill-country backs.
The very large gathering present was caught in a tense atmosphere for the major part of the game, especially in the second half. In the last ten minutes Royal had only 14 players one had to exit due to a red card. All in all it was good game of rugby under wet conditions underfoot.
For Royal Sabith Feroze and Hamza Reeza scored the tries. One try was goaled by Shaqir Nawfer and the drop goal by Ovin Askey. For Dharmaraja T.B. Bandara and T.H. Epa scored the tries. One try was goaled by I. Deshapriya and the drop goal came off the boot of B. Udangamuwa. Referee: Irshad Cader

The Kingswoodians played with determination and indulged in a superb team effort which gave them the win. It was the dynamic team effort, which gave them the break, the winners dictating terms made some superb breaks and handled the ball in the proper way. The winning team warmed the hearts of their supporters, and played some good rugby. St. Sylvester’s failed to play more as a team. Referee: Deepal Punyawardene.
