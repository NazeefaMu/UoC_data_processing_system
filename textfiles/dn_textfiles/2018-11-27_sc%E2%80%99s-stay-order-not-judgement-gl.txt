SC’s stay order is not judgement - GL

The Attorney General has already made a request to the Supreme Court to appoint a full bench to hear the case in connection with the gazette notification issued by the President dissolving Parliament, Sri Lanka Podu Jana Peramuna (SLPP) Chairman Prof. G.L.Peiris said.
Speaking at a press conference at the SLPP Headquarters in Battaramulla yesterday, he said he made a request to the Supreme Court to appoint more than three judges to hear the case. The entire country will get to know the decision of the Supreme Court on December 7. The Supreme Court only issued a stay order and it is not the final judgement of the Court. The UNP is trying its best to mislead the public by stating that it is the final decision of the Supreme Court which is incorrect.
According to Prof. Peiris, no political party in Parliament has the majority and the government has 103 and the UNP has 101. The JVP said it will not vote to appoint the UNP Leader as the Prime Minister. The TNA has not declared that it will vote to appoint the former PM as PM again. This type of Parliament is useless because it cannot function. The people have the sovereignty. The people should be allowed to use their franchise and elect a new Parliament of their choice.
Prof. Peiris said that since no party 113 has seats, the best option is to hold a general election. There aren’t many choices to solve this issue. The Speaker has pushed this country into anarchy because he favours the UNP and his relatives.
