Rambutan prices up

Farmers are reaping a bumper Rambutan harvest these days in the Malwana areas and in and around Kalmunai and Akkaraipattu towns.
However, prices have increased. Rambutan traders said the main reason for this is high prices of other seasonal fruits and transport charges. The price of a rambutan ranges between Rs. 8 to Rs. 10 each.
