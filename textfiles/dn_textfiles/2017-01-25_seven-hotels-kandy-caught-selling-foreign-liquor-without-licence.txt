Seven hotels in Kandy caught selling foreign liquor without licence

Officers attached to the Kandy Excise raided seven hotels in Amunugama which were selling foreign liquor without a licence and seized a stock of foreign liquor valued at nearly Rs. 2 million yesterday.
A spokesman for the Excise Unit said 173 bottles of wine and beer were seized from a single hotel. Investigations are conducted to ascertain whether the liquor had been smuggled into the country dodging Customs duty.
Legal action is to be taken against the hotel managers.
