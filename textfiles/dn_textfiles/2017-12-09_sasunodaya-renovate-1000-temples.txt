Sasunodaya to renovate 1,000 temples

Rs. 475 million was donated to renovate 1,000 dilapidated Buddhist temples under the “Sasunodaya” national programme. Each temple will receive Rs. 500,000, Education Minister Akila Viraj Kariyawasam said.
He was speaking to the media personnel on December 8 in Kurunegala. The money needed for the programme was collected by selling tickets to foreigners who visit historic places of the island, ministry sources said.
Central Cultural Fund Chairman Prof. Prishantha Gunawardena has initiated the programme under the guidance of the Minister.
