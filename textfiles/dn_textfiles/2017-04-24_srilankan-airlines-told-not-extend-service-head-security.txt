SriLankan Airlines told not to extend service of Head of Security

The Presidential Commission inquiring into Serious Acts of Fraud, Corruption and Abuse of Power, State Resources and Privileges (PRECIFAC) has informed SriLankan Airlines not to extend the services of the company’s Head of Security. The PRECIFAC, observing that the said officer has influenced the on-going investigations relating to SriLankan Airlines,  has requested in writing not to grant him a service extension. The letter has also referred to the allegations against the officer and has asked to hold a disciplinary inquiry into them.
The PRECIFAC said it has received complaints that the said officer had threatened the individuals who gave evidence before the Commission. The PRECIFAC is currently investigating into several complaints related to the large scale corruption and fraud at SriLankan Airlines during the previous administration.
A copy of the letter has been sent to the Public Enterprise Development Ministry. A Ministry official confirming the receipt of the letter said a note was sent to the Director Board of SriLankan Airlines following the New Year holiday to take appropriate action and report back to the Ministry.
“SriLankan Airlines is managed by its Director Board. The ministry is only responsible for the appointment of the Director Board.
Thereafter the Director Board is responsible for the appointment of other officials and taking disciplinary action against any of them,” a ministry official said.
