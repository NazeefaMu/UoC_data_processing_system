GMOA led token strike today

Over 30 trade unions in the health, education and transport sectors will launch a token strike on May 5 (today) at 8.00 am in protest against SAITM. The Government Medical Officers Association (GMOA) will make sure that no patient dies and all maternity and children’s hospitals will function as usual. The strike will not affect the functions of the Maharagama Cancer Hospital, all kidney treatment institutions, all accident wards countrywide, GMOA Secretary Dr. Navin De Zoysa said.
Addressing a press conference held at the GMOA Head Quarters in Colombo yesterday the GMOA Secretary said the safety of patients’ lives and the quality of medical education should be protected on behalf of the country’s innocent poor people who cannot afford to obtain medical treatment from the Mount Elizabeth Hospital, Singapore. There is no problem for the persons who can afford to seek medical treatment from the Mount Elizabeth Hospital, Singapore.
According to Dr.Zoysa, the token strike will end on may 6th at 8.00 am but this will be the commencement of contentious strike to be launched countrywide in all sectors if an acceptable solution is not found to the SAITM crisis by May 9th. There is no use of unrealistic talks and proposals. The set of proposals presented to the Government one month ago by the GMOA, Deans of all State Medical Faculties of Sri Lanka and the Faculty of Medicine Teachers’ Associations (FMTAs) should be implemented.
Dr. Zoysa pointed out that the suppression of trade unions has already commenced. But nothing or no one will be able to stop the GMOA until the Government takes over SAITM. Three persons, one of them armed had come in search of the Convener of Faculty of Medicine Teachers’ Associations (FMTAs) Dr. M.C. Weerasinghe. A formal complaint in connection with the incident has already been lodged at the Borella Police station. It is hope that the police will solve it similarly to how they solved Sameera Senaratne shooting drama.
Railway drivers and guards will join the token strike launched by the GMOA over SAITM issue.
However, station masters and railway controllers will not join the trade union action.
