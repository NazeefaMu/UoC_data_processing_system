Protesting against the dumping of garbage

People in Vidudikkal, in Mawadimunmari, launched a demonstration blocking the road protesting against the dumping of garbage at the Vidudikkal waste mountain which caught fire yesterday. Tractors belonging to the Manmunai South West Pradeshiya Sabha which came to dump garbage at the spot, were prevented from reaching the point by the protestors.
