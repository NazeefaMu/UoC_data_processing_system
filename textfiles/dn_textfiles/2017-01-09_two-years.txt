Two years on

Two years is a short time to make a proper assessment of a new government's record in office. Usually, the first year is devoted to consolidating power while the second is the time when it gets down to business in earnest. It should also be borne in mind that although President Sirisena was voted into Office on January 8th the Unity Government was formed only in August following the general election. Hence the government's record should be assessed only from this point, some may argue. But, for all intents and purposes, the new government came into being with the election of President Sirisena two years ago at which time the change was ushered in and the government's overall performance should be gauged from this landmark happening.
Considering this, there is a lot to be happy with the turn of events and the changes wrought that has impacted positively on the citizenry. There can be no doubt that there is a discerning sense of freedom and an air of well being among the general public during the past two years. Many structures of the state that shackled the people have been dismantled and replaced by instruments that have enhanced and strengthened their rights. The oppressive powers of the President has been curtailed to a great extent through the introduction of the 19th Amendment and the long overdue Right to Information Act brought in to ensure probity and transparency in governance. Independent Commissions have been put in place to end arbitrary decision making and ensure fairness. The climate of fear that enveloped the nation is a thing of the past and freedom to criticise the government is only all too evident with several media institutions taking the government to task with gay abandon.
President Sirisena has also succeeded in winning over countries which were hostile towards Sri Lanka in the past and had the honour of a visit by a US Secretary of State to this country for the first time in several decades. He also had the privilege of being invited as a special guest to the G8 summit in Tokyo rubbing shoulders with world leaders including US President Barack Obama. All in all the country's standing internationally has risen appreciably under President Sirisena.
On the ethnic front, the past two years has seen communal harmony on an unprecedented scale with the President taking a personal initiative to make frequent visits to the North and interact with the Tamil community. He has also taken steps to reduce the military presence in the north and give back the lands, taken over by the army during the period of the war, to their original owners. Bold initiatives have been taken over the past two years to accelerate the reconciliation process and bring about a permanent solution to the national question, for which the President has won praise from many countries.
Some point out that the Yahapalanaya government under President Sirisena has not moved along in the expected pace on the development front and that corruption is raising its head again in government. Opponents have also taken the government to task for allegedly being lenient towards Tamil politicians who express pro-separatist sentiments and for taking the country on the path of division. Even those who voted for the President are largely disappointed by what they see as a lackadaisical approach of his government in making fundamental changes. For instance they find fault with the government for tardiness in bringing to book the corrupt of the former regime. There is also criticism over high taxes and the steep rise in the Cost of Living. The Opposition is quick to point out that development had stalled and that no new development projects have been started under the Yahapalanaya regime and indeed it was opening projects commenced by Mahinda Rajapaksa.
While there may be some justification to these claims the government cannot be expected to perform on all fronts at once in such a short time. It cannot plunge headlong into development projects without taking into consideration the cost benefit factor. The country has been landed in a massive debt burden thanks to injudicious moves by the former President to opt for mega schemes such as the Hambantota Port and Mattala airport without proper assessment of the economic returns that will accrue to the country.
For all that, the Yahapalanaya government under President Sirisena has displayed the will to succeed.While settling the mountainous debt, left behind by the Rajapaksa administration, it has taken determined strides to rebuild the economy and also usher in prudent development that would bring beneficial returns to the country.
President Sirisena has repeatedly asserted he would not allow a separation of the country and has put to rest fears entertained by the public over the new constitution, which the Joint Opposition is attempting to drum into their collective minds. As he has often said the constitution is still in the making and will be finalised only with the inputs of all stakeholders. The President has already declared that the 2017 will usher in a development revolution in the country and asserted that the Yahapalanaya government is unshakable and would run its full course.
