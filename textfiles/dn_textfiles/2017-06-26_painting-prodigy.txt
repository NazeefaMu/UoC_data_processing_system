Painting prodigy

Cassie Gee is only five-years-old, but she already has a thriving business as an artist.
It is clear the Australian from Sydney, is no ordinary kid as her marvellous paintings go well beyond the usual finger painting you would normally see from a human her age.
The young girl creates stunning swirl paintings using a combination of acrylic paint, resin and glitter to create faraway landscapes and galaxies. She sells her incredible artwork through her website and Etsy store.
According to her website, Cassie has been “professional artist” since the age of three and her artistic style is unrestrained and free. Besides painting, she also loves the beach, fairies and elephants. Incredible talent is not the only thing this young girl embodies. While sharing her art with the world, she also uses all the proceeds from her sales to support many charities with amazing causes.
In 2016, she donated $250 to install a rainwater tank for school kids in Cambodia. She has also donated money to the White Helmets, an amazing volunteer organisation that operates in parts of Syria.
This year, her proceeds will go to Got A Pen, a charity organisation that donated pencil cases and colouring pencils to disadvantaged children. Miss Gee proves we can all learn a lot from children. ANI
