The club offers a wide range of water sports activities  jet-skiing, tube rides, wakeboarding and boating, to name a few, making it a one-stop shop for the water sports enthusiast from every corner of the country.
The novel concept by Debug Hospitality and Leisure was started with the aim of promoting and encouraging water sports in Sri Lanka by creating a safe, private and luxurious environment for water sports enthusiasts to gather, learn and experience the lifestyle and to foster a community of likeminded individuals with a love for water and the oppurtunities to adventure it provides.
