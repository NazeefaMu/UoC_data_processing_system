Two nabbed for  solar panel theft

 Two youths who had stolen a roof-top solar electricity panel from a house in Siyambalagaswewa in Anuradhapura were arrested by Anuradhapura Police yesterday.

The two suspects have been identified as 22-year-old and 25-year-old residents of Alayapaththuwa.
They will be produced before the Anuradhapura Magistrate's Court.
