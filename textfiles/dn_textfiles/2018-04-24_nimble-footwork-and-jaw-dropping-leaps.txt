Nimble  footwork and jaw-dropping leaps

A classical ballet presentation by reputed foreign artistes is a rare occurrence in Colombo. It was a treat to watch the Natalia Permyakova Russian Chamber Ballet Troupe perform at the Nelum Pokuna (courtesy of the Russian Center) with beautiful digital images forming a panoramic backdrop. Though tickets were terribly expensive the hall was packed, which goes to show that ballet aficionados will pay any price to watch a good show. And they certainly got their money’s worth.
There were some lovely excerpts from well-known ballets such as Swan Lake, Giselle, Don Quixote, Raymonda, and Chopiniana (otherwise known as Les Sylphides). Careful thought had gone into the selection of these pieces as there was a fine mix of solos, pas de deux, and ensemble dances. The judicious blend of adagios and allegros too was deeply satisfying. In terms of balance, variety (classical, modern, folk), and visual impact (enhanced by skillful lighting), the performance overall was impressive. The music too (by renowned composers such as Tchaikovsky, Minkus, Glazunov, Chopin, Weber and Adam) had enormous depth and range. The Director, Natalia Permyakova (Professor in Pedagogical Sciences), should be commended for the expert manner in which she wove the different elements into a stylish and cohesive production. The choreography on the whole (which included some original items created for the ensemble) was world-class. The costumes were tastefully designed and blended harmoniously with the mood and tenor of each dance.
The ensemble consisted of twelve dancers from the Bolshoi and Mariinsky. It is interesting to note that the oldest performer, Elena Pankova (born in 1974), was a prima ballerina of the Mariinsky. The foundation for most Russian ballet dancers is the Vaganova method which is unique to Russia. Although superficially it is similar to other methods, such as French and Cecchetti, there are subtle differences in respect of basic positions such as tendu, attitude, arabesque, retiré, port de bras, and epaulement, not to mention that floating quality called ballon associated with athletic jumps. Indeed, in both the classical and character dances we saw jaw-dropping leaps by gifted male dancers where they seemed to hover in the air. In respect of quiet power, athleticism and physicality, the male dancers outshone their female counterparts, but when it came to grace and fluidity of movement, the females had the edge.
It is only when professional Russian ballet dancers come to town that we get an opportunity to appreciate the subtleties and nuances of the Vaganova method. Sadly, this happens only once in a blue moon. Be that as it may, what the twelve artistes showed us is that in order to become an accomplished dancer you need to demonstrate sound technique, which entails several hours of training every day for several years with reputed teachers who are experts not only in dance but in injury prevention as well. Correct technique and injury prevention go hand in hand.
The dancers were extremely supple and demonstrated robust technique combined with fluency of movement. They all had superb posture and carriage and exhibited mastery of turn-out, hip rotation and placement. Their eyes were focused, their lines pure, and footwork, precise and nimble. They were also spot on (most of the time) in respect of poise, balance and control and performed difficult movements (including precision lifts) with consummate ease. The few minor blemishes that did occur could perhaps be attributed to a slippery floor.
The two standout items, in my view, were Le Spectre de la Rose – an august pas de deux choreographed by the iconic Mikhail Fokin and performed with aplomb to Weber’s celebrated Invitation to the Dance (the scratchy sound notwithstanding) and Grand Pas – a lively and longish ensemble dance from the ballet Don Quixote involving complex choreography by Alexander Gorsky, who restaged many of Petipa’s ballets, including Don Quixote. The dancing was airy and vibrant and the music by Minkus, unforgettable.
Though the dancers had great poise and strong technique, their capacity for emotional and artistic expression was a touch limited, which perhaps explains why they did not connect intimately with the audience, judging from the muted applause at the end of each item. For instance: (a) the pas de deux from Giselle that occurs after the tragic heroine has become an elusive Wili is meant to be deeply moving, but the poignant aspects of this dance did not come through although it was neatly performed; (b) though the soloist who executed the Gipsy Dance from Don Quixote was very nimble and stylish, she lacked the power and sensuality of, say, an Irina Zibrova; (c) Waltz No. 7 from Chopiniana was charming but not enchanting enough to hold the audience spellbound; (d) though the solo Californian Poppy dance (first performed by the legendary Anna Pavlova) was engaging, it did not quite encapsulate the profoundly haunting quality of the music by Tchaikovsky (Melody No. 3, Op. 42).
The eclectic finale, on the other hand, performed by the ensemble to the music of Minkus, was studded with glittering cameos and drew a warm applause from the audience. The concert ended on a high note with the audience clapping to the pulsating beat of the spectacular curtain call.
In sum, this was a quality performance by the Russian Chamber Ballet Troupe. The dancing was technically sound and enriched with some luminous moments that will linger in our minds for some time. If there is a lesson to be learnt from this show, it is that there are no short cuts to becoming a top-notch professional dancer. People in this country who dream of getting into a professional dance company overseas have to train as hard as Olympic athletes to realize their goals.
