CA Sri Lanka, ICCSL to promote accounting among local youth

The Institute of Chartered Accountants of Sri Lanka (CA Sri Lanka) recently joined hands with the International Chamber of Commerce Sri Lanka (ICCSL) to jointly promote accounting as the preferred career choice among the students’ population and the business community in the country.
The agreement between CA Sri Lanka and ICCSL will pave way to increase the number of qualified accounting professionals suitable to serve business organizations across the country.
In the pursuit to make accountancy as the preferred career choice among youth in the country, both bodies will work together to jointly develop and enhance the necessary curricula as well as put in place the requirements for examinations to reach the goal of having a skilled nation with sufficient accounting professionals who will go on to steer businesses with their unique financial acumen.
The Memorandum of Agreement (MoU) was signed by CA Sri Lanka President Lasantha Wickremasinghe and ICCSL Chairman Dinesh Weerakkody.
CA Sri Lanka and ICCSL will also work together to jointly enhance the country’s business industry and will also promote Sri Lanka as a business hub to the world. Both bodies will also organise various events including seminars and workshops for the benefit of members of both bodies where topical matters in relation to the business world as well as the accounting profession will be focused upon.
