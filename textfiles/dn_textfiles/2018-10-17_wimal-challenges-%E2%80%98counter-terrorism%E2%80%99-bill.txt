Wimal challenges ‘Counter Terrorism’ Bill

A Special Determination petition challenging the bill titled “Counter Terrorism” was yesterday filed before Supreme Court by MP Wimal Weerawansa.
He is seeking a declaration that the bill shall become law only through a two-thirds majority in Parliament and the approval of the people at a referendum.
The petitioner MP Weerawansa stated that the concerned Bill was presented to Parliament and placed on the Order Paper on October 9, 2018. Weerawansa is seeking a determination that several Clauses of the Bill titled “Counter Terrorism” are inconsistent with Article 1, 2, 3, 4, 12(1), 30, 75 and 83 and of the Constitution. The petitioner said Clause 2(2) and 3 of the proposed act restrict the scope and application of the law and Clause 3 read with Clauses 7, 8, 9 , 10, 13, 14 limit the application and operation of the law, which is detrimental to National Security.
Weerawansa said Clauses 2 to 13 that seek to remove the death penalty for committing the offence of murder and impose mitigated sentences for several offences, discriminates against persons indicted for same crimes under the Penal Code. He further stated that the clauses 33,34,43,48,62 and 69 empowers the Human Rights Commission to unnecessarily interfere with the investigation process. He further maintained that Clause 83 imposes limitations on the President to declare curfew.
This special determination petition was filed through Senior Counsel Kanishka Vitharana and Counsel G.T. Madubhashinie.
