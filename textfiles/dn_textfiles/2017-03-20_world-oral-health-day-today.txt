World Oral Health Day today

The World Oral Health Day falls today. and this year's theme is `Live Mouth Smart'. The National ceremony to mark the day will be held in Ratnapura with the participation of Health Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne, Health Ministry sources said.
According to the sources, the Health Ministry is paying special attention to improve oral health of schoolchildren. Arrangements have also been made to discourage the tobacco use among youths and adults.
School leavers, rubber estate workers, gem mine workers, and bus and three wheeler drivers will be educated through special programmes initiated by the ministry since they are in high risk groups to get addicted to tobacco and related products, the sources said.
Smoking and betel chewing have been recognised as two main causes for oral cancers, the sources added.
