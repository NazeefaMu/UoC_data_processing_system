Renault Kwid enjoys three digit growth

Driving to the top of small car market French car brand, the Renault KWID, marketed by AMW in Sri Lanka, has reached an envious volume of growth for their vehicles recently.
Renault made its market debut in Sri Lanka at the end of 2016. Renault KWID was generating a monthly sales volume of around 30 cars per month at the beginning of 2017 thereby growing rapidly to generate its current sales volume of over 120 cars per month, and clinching over 4500 customer base in the process.
The brand has experienced a growth of 112% when comparing with 2017 and has achieved a robust three-digit growth in monthly sales.
This is an interesting turnaround for the brand that initially garnered bad reviews and complaints, which has now jumped to the position of being a true game changer after the product performance was proven and becoming a strong contender for other competing brands in the small car segment.
Commenting on these achievements, Chaminda Perera, Director of Renault Sri Lanka stated “As per the feedback we have received, it has been shown that consumers look upon the KWID with it’s SUV-inspired styling and feature-rich interiors as a more premium car that breaks the monotony that the other small hatchback models in the market offer.
This has attracted a large number of young executive’s to consider the brand as a top option for their first car. It has also been a huge hit with the female market as it is an ideally stylish small car for women.
There are also those who have purchased it as a family car considering the vehicles space and fuel efficiency.” On its distribution network, Perera said, the company already has 8 Renault dealers & 21 service outlets by the end of December 2017, making the car available in all the key regions of the country while giving easy access to their after sales network.
Shehann De Zoysa, General Manager of Renault Sri Lanka further added “Our focus for 2018 will be to continue to build upon this growth trajectory, reflecting our long-term commitment to the Sri Lankan market in making the cars more accessible to customers across the country.”
