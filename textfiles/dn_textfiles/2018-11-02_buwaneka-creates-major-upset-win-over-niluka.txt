Buwaneka creates major upset with win over Niluka

Buwaneka Gunathilleka created a major upset at the 66th National Badminton championships being held at the Royal College Sport Complex when he beat former national champion Niluka Karunaratne in the men’s singles quarterfinal match yesterday.
This is the first time that Niluka, a 16-time national champion has failed to qualify for the semi-finals of the men’s singles event.
Buwaneka and Niluka put up a tremendous fight from the beginning and Buwaneka emerged victorious to take the first set narrowly at 24-22. However Niluka, the most experienced shuttler having vast international experience made a good come back winning the second set 21-17. The third and deciding set saw Buwaneka take an early lead and was virtually on the doorstep to victory at 18-12 when his opponent was forced to retire thus conceding the match to the 22-year-old.
Buwaneka, the former Richmondite who is employed at MAS Group will meet Niluka’s brother Dinuka Karunaratne in today’s semi finals. These two players met last year in the men’s singles final which Dinuka won.
Buwaneka, the most promising shuttler was overlooked for the last Asian Games when his place in the men’s singles was given to Niluka who lost badly lost to a Thailand player in the first round. Yesterday Buwaneka proved a point that he is the most suitable to represent his country in the men’s singles.
Dinuka Karunaratne the defending champion beat 17-year-old Viren Nettasinghe 21/11, 21/14 while Diluka the other brother of Karunaratne family beat Chiran Sudeera 21/8 and 21/16 to enter the semi-finals.
Sachin Dias dissapointed when he lost to young Ranthushka Sasidu in a three setter. In the semi-finals Sasidu of Nalanda College will meet Diluka in the second semi finals today.
Meanwhile Buwaneka Gunatilleka and Sachin Dias entered the men's double semi-finals when they beat Karunaratne brothers Diluka and Chamika in two hard fought sets 21/16, 21/15. However Niluka the eldest Karunaratne brother and Dinuka Karunaratne bowed out from the men's doubles due to Niluka's injury during the single game against Buwaneka. According to the chief match referee Samantha Navaratne when a player gets injured during a match and retires he cannot take part in other matches on that day.
The open women’s singles and doubles and men’s open doubles and mixed doubles will be played today with all the finals scheduled to be worked off on Saturday where Sports Minister Faiszer Mustapha will be the chief guest.
