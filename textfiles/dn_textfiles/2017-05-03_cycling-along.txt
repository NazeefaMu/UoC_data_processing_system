Cycling along...

I decided to avoid cycling through Colombo. Conveniently, there's a small town called Negombo near the airport. And 2km from Negombo is Negombo beach, which is full of guest houses and tourist restaurants. The ride from the airport was straight forward. There's not too much traffic, not too much honking, the traffic lights work, and people seem to obey them.
In Negombo, I found a room in the house of Cedric Seneviratne. The street is named for Cedric's father who owned DC (desicated coconut) Oil and Fibre Mills and built four houses in the street for his four kids. Cedric is 86. And a character. I gave him my passport, he wrote down the number and my name. There were four women moving out, and as soon as they'd left, Cedric said I could move into their room and freshen up. I asked if the room needed a clean. He said, "Oh ... no ... here's the broom. It'll be fine".
Ok, I said, trying hard to suppress a smile. I asked if he had clean sheets. He looked puzzled a bit and wandered off. I went to unpack. A while later, he called out "Gwyn, Gwyn", and came with a sheet. "Very good sheet", he said. "Best".
Cedric worked in Britain for seven years in the late 50s-60s. He was an automotive engineer. "Of sorts", he said. Turned out he was the Chief Engineer at a top Sri Lankan motor company for years. And a famous racing driver. Won all the five circuit races of Sri Lanka, plus lots of road races too. He even built his own racing car out of a chassis imported from England and a Sri Lankan engine and body. There was a laminated newspaper article, a recent one, about him on the wall.
Cedric sent me down the road for rice and curry. But the place didn't serve rice and curry, it served expensive fish'n'chips. So I got on my bike and went to town and on the way found rice and curry with fish for Rs100. Very nice. Different flavours from Indian curries.
The tourist area of Negombo is relatively expensive. No Sri Lankans eating in the restaurants.
I walked down the beach, past cuddling teenage couples under umbrellas, outriggers, resorts. There were lights strung up in the streets for St Sebastian (Negombo is predominantly catholic). A parade through the town. I ate a lovely rice cake filled with sugar and coconut that someone gave me. Sat and watched a fabulous sunset.
Next day I caught an early bus for Colombo to extend my visa (I got 30 days on entry). The whole process took around two hours (you need a passport-sized photo). Lots of ex-Sri Lankans applying for visas along with the tourists. I sat next to a guy who lived in Ireland. He was Tamil. Had given up his Sri Lankan passport as a form of protest. Now his mother was sick and he wanted to stay for a bit.
From the bus, I saw: McDonalds, pawn shops, semi-trailers, nice cars, massive supermarket-type things. Arpico in Negombo is Wal-Mart-esque. And cyclists. Road cyclists. Real ones clad in lycra. A guy on his own. Two guys together. Another guy. A woman. A bunch of guys... On fancy road bikes...
Colombo was very busy. Lots of traffic. But fairly clean. There are bins that people use. Went to the National Museum (good, but quite a few galleries were closed). Bought a map of the country published by the Survey Dept. Seems fine. Sheltered for an hour or so from a thunderstorm and torrential rain. Got wet. Got the bus back. The trip took over two hours (40km) - there was some surface flooding, and rush hour didn't help things. Ate kotthu string hoppers for dinner. Rice noodles chop-chop-chopped with veges.
A few days in Negombo... It rained all night and most of the day. Not hard. Drizzly and sometimes worse. I shall sit out the rain. And also wait out the cold I have picked up. Annoying this cold.
Cedric asked me to buy him Strepsils and multi vitamins. And chocloate of a certain sort - he collects the wrappers as part of some competition. "I'll get you some money", he said. He is infirm, unsure on his feet. He got up from his plastic chair and tapped the ground with his walking stick, making sure the rubber stopper wouldn't slip. Then he shuffled off, sliding little more than half a foot length at a time.
Yesterday, I told him I was missing my cycle computer. And my headlamp. His cleaner arrived earlier that morning and Cedric asked me if I wanted the guy to sweep my room. I said, sure. Cedric said to stay with him. But I didn't stay long, left him alone in my room. Later on, I wanted to know the time but couldn't find the little computer, which is my watch. I searched everywhere. Noticed, too, that the torch was gone. My old Che Guevara t-shirt was outside, hanging over an electrical cable. So I told Cedric and asked if he could ask his cleaner if he'd seen my watch and torch. I said he may have swept them away accidentally...
