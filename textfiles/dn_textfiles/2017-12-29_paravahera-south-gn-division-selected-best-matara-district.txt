Under the Samurdhi Productions national development programme of one main production project for one village which was implemented in 2017 by the government, the Paravahera South Grama Niladari Division in the Matara District, had been been selected as the best division.
According to project officials, black smiths’ industries (black smiths’ workshops) are the main stay of the economy of the people living in this village.
The next is the gem and jewellery industry, pottery and manufacture of bricks and tiles. In addition, the garage industry has also been one of the livelihood activities of them.
Amidst various shortcomings, the people have been engaged in these industries.
The want of physical resources had been an obstacle in their way to carry out these industrial ventures successfully.
The aim of the Samurdhi Development Department would be to create more novel industries in villages so as to improve the living conductions of the people. A sum of rupees 70 million has been allocated to develop these industrial ventures in villages.
A programme of constructing houses for low income families had also been under way at the moment. All access roads to these villages would also be improved, Project officials said.
On the instructions of Matara District Secretary Pradeep Rathnayake, the Samurdhi Development branch of the Matara District Secretariat had implemented these programmes.
