‘Stable govt. under PM Rajapaksa will reverse economic crisis’

Only a stable government under a practical leader like Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa can bring back the country from the economic crisis created by the previous regime led by Ranil Wickremesinghe, said Agriculture Minister Mahinda Amaraweera.
He was addressing a meeting at Tangalle, recently. The meeting was held to educate the supporters of the party regarding the political situation in the country.
The minister said the Maithri - Mahinda combination will fulfill the aspirations of the people. He said their reunion was a long-awaited expectation of the people, the Maha Sangha and other religious clergy. He said the only person who has maintained the identity of the country is Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa, who is a fully-fledged leader who brought an end to the barbaric LTTE terrorists.
The minister added that the new government has a short term of office.
“The government needs to be strengthened. It must go before the people at the earliest possible date,” he said.
The minister said it is clear that the mandate to appoint the Prime Minister lies under the sole authority and discretion of the President and that the Speaker had no authority at all.
