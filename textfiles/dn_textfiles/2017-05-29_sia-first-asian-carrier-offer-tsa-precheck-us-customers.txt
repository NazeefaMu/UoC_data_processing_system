SIA first Asian carrier to offer TSA Precheck for US customers

Singapore Airlines (SIA) and the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) have partnered to offer customers travelling from US airports expedited security screening procedures under the TSA Precheck programme.
SIA is the first Asian airline to be participating in the TSA Precheck programme.
TSA Precheck enables low-risk known travellers to enjoy the programme’s benefits while reducing checkpoint wait times. This provides a separate lane for security screening during departure, where the traveller does not have to remove jackets, belts, laptops, liquids and shoes.
Enrolment in the TSA Precheck programme is open to US citizens and lawful permanent residents.
However, non-US citizens may also enjoy the benefits of the programme through various Customs Border Protection (CBP) trusted traveller programmes, such as Global Entry, NEXUS and SENTRI. Singapore citizens are eligible to apply for the Global Entry Programme, which is also open to citizens from the following countries: Colombia, Germany, Netherlands, Panama, South Korea, UK, and Mexican nationals.
Successful applicants of the TSA Precheck programme or other CBP trusted traveller programmes will receive a Known Traveler Number (KTN) which may be provided to the airline during booking or check-in.
Once the customer’s KTN is recognised, the TSA Precheck logo will be printed on their boarding pass, indicating that their KTN has been captured in their booking record. Customers can provide their KTN across SIA’s various check-in or booking channels, including its call agents, online reservations system, and website check-in via singaporeair.com or SingaporeAir mobile app, in addition to checking in at the airport counter.
Children aged 12 and under may also enjoy the benefits of TSA Precheck if they are travelling with passengers who have a valid KTN. As a partner airline under the TSA Precheck programme, SIA will also be able to offer customers travelling to and from the US an option of having a Self-Printed Boarding Pass (SPBP) and/or Mobile Boarding Pass (MBP).
This will enable travellers without check-in bags to check in online and proceed directly to the gate at the airport. Customers can expect this to be implemented in the coming months.
