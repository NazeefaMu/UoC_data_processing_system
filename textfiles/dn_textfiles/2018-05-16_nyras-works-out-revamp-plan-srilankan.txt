Nyras works out revamp plan for SriLankan

Action has been taken to revamp SriLankan Airlines taking into consideration the 10 point plan submitted by Nyras Aviation Consultants, and the responses made to them by sectional heads, SriLankan Airlines Chairman Ranjith Fernando said.
Accordingly, several route changes were in the offing to minimise excessive losses in certain routes, he said.
Fernando said as regards the enormous leasing charges overdue on planes, discussions had begun with the relevant companies to obtain relief on interest rates charged.
