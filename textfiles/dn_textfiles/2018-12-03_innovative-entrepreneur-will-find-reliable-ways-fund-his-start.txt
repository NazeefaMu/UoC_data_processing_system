So, you want to start-up and develop a small business – Part 13
The innovative entrepreneur will find reliable ways to fund his start-up

Our previous instalments were intended to help you put the foundation of your small business in place: coming up with your best idea, figuring out what it will cost to create a business, drafting a business plan, and choosing the right legal structure are the basic building blocks of any successful small business.
Now you can build on that solid foundation. Getting the money to realize your dream can happen only if you have a solid foundation in place; any lender or investor will want to see that those pieces are set.
As emphasised by us earlier, even if you are going to self-fund the business - through savings, credit cards, or some other plan - this foundation is no less important, as it is the basis for creating a small business that will last. If you have done the work suggested in the previous instalments you know exactly how much money you will need to get started and stay open, which puts you far ahead of most new small business entrepreneurs, who have only a vague idea of how much money they will need.
Now the difficult question is where will you find the money to start your business.
Sources
There are many sources of funding - which is good, because it is highly unlikely that you will secure all of your required funding from one place. Maybe you will combine personal savings and credit cards with a small industry loan and a gift from an uncle. Who knows? While finding the money to fund the dream is always a challenge for an entrepreneur, it is part of the job.
Yes, it will be tough, you may get discouraged, and you may not raise as much money as you want; but remember, countless new business owners have found the money to start their businesses, and if they did it, you can, too. If you have a good idea and a solid plan, you can do it.
The vast majority of small businesses are started, at least partly, using the entrepreneur’s own funds. Indeed, even if you are looking to outside investors, most will want to see that you are sharing some of the financial risk. Yes, tapping your savings for a new, untried venture is a scary thought, but remember, an entrepreneur is a person who is willing to take a risk with money to make money.
Risking some of your own money, then, is part of the job description. Where do you find that money?
The Friends and Family
The next most common method of funding your start-up is to find friends and family members who believe in you and your vision and are willing to invest in your new company. Again, this is where your business plan will be necessary. If you can show potential investors a plan that makes sense, the chance of getting them to invest greatly increases. A great thing about this option is that friends and family tend to lend or invest either interest free or at very low interest rates, which makes your job much easier.
Especially at the beginning of your venture, capital is precious and must be,if not horded, at least highly respected. You need to keep your overhead as low as possible; low interest on debts helps, and that is why this can be an attractive option.
The danger, of course, is that most small businesses are not home runs. Far more likely, you will create a successful business that makes a nice profit and affords you some freedom and a good standard of living. But if that does not happen, if the business does not fly, owing money to friends and relatives for a failed business venture is not a pleasant experience.
You have been warned. For the banks’ lending money to an untried, brand-new start-up is just about the riskiest. Home loans are secured by collateral, as are car loans. Loans to existing businesses offer some security because the business has a track record. But the new start-up has none of those things, and so getting a conventional bank loan for a new business is not always easy, especially in the past few years. But the good news when it comes to bank loans is that banks want to lend you money.
That is their business, and many are working hard to get money in the hands of their small business customers. Other entrepreneurs get bank loans for their new ventures every day, and if they did, so can you. Of course, that often means using your home as collateral or signing a personal guarantee for the loan. The problem with a personal guarantee is that incorporating to reduce your personal liability will be a waste of time if you sign a personal guarantee for a bank loan. Then again, entrepreneurs have been known to do almost anything to get the show on the road, and that may be the price you have to pay. The upshot is that to get a business loan, you need to think like a banker.
The Four Cs
When lenders look to extend credit, they are most concerned with the four Cs:
1. Capacity. Do you have the ability to repay the loan? A bank will want to see that your business has sufficient cash flow to service the loan, and thus it will ask to see your financial statements. A bank is much more likely to loan to a business that has been around for a while and has a track record. New start-ups with little history fail this test.
2. Collateral. Can you secure the loan with some sort of collateral? If the answer is yes, then the likelihood of getting a loan is much greater. Just as banks do not make home loans without securing the loan by getting a deed of trust on the property, they also require some sort of collateral to secure a business loan. If you do not have collateral, you will likely need a co-signer who does.
3. Character. Does your business have a history of repaying loans on time? Do you have a history of paying on time? Because you will likely be asked to sign a personal guarantee for any business loan you get, your personal credit history is important.
4. Capital. How much money do you need, and why do you need it? You’ll need to come to the bank with financial statements, a business plan, and a solid explanation for the exact amount you want, how it will be used, and when it will be paid back.
Other considerations
Aside from the four Cs, banks may also look at two additional factors when determining whether to give you a loan (called underwriting).
Let’s call these the two Es:
1. Equity. When you buy a home and begin to make payments, you build equity. If your house is worth $100,000 and you owe $75,000, then you have $25,000 in equity. It is the actual cash value of the property. Well, the same is true for your business.
Ironically, one way to get a business loan is to prove that you don’t need one, and the way to do that is to build equity in your business. This can be done by retaining earnings or by receiving a cash injection from someone. Most banks like to see that your debt is no more than four times your equity. You need equity to make sure your ratios pencil out.
2. Experience. More relevant to a new start-up, your experience in the business and your experience in the area that the loan is going toward is a final factor that a banker will look at when conducting a lending analysis. So, do you qualify for a business loan?
Let’s find out. Do you have a good credit history (personal bank loans, outstanding credit card payments etc)? Are your taxes up to date? Do you have a financial plan showing how to repay the loan? Does your business have equity? Does your business have any debt? Do you, the owner, have your own money invested in the business? Does the business have collateral? Would you be willing to personally guarantee the loan? Do you have a solid management team? Do you have a solid business plan?
Unless you answered “Yes” to all questions, you may have a hard time getting a loan.
The government knows how important small businesses are to the Sri Lankan economy.

Therefore, it encourages commercial banks to offer SME loans. For example, Sanasa Development Bank offers SME loan scheme which allows successful micro-entrepreneurs to graduate to SME status through existing SME clients, the provision of credit facilities for expansion of business activities and a range of support services. All commercial banks provide credit facilities to Micro Small and Medium scale Enterprises and constructors to purchase related machinery and equipment and other requirements.
The good news is that your credit need not be perfect to get a microfinance loan.
The final option is to find a partner. Finding a partner with the money when you provide the great idea and sweat equity is a tried-and-true business funding option. There are risks involved in partnerships but those depend on the type of partners you select.
