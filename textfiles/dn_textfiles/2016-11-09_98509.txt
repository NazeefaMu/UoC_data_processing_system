Karting stars Ashvitha, Maryse represent Sri Lanka in Malaysia

Sri Lankan karting stars Ashvitha Wickrama and Maryse Navaratne are taking part in the world’s first all-women extreme 4x4 challenge, SHEMUD 2016 that began on Saturday and conclude on November 11.
Hailed as being the female version of the world-renowned Rainforest Challenge (RFC), this year’s competition will bring together 10 fearless, all-female teams from around the world to take on the thick jungles of Malaysia.
Veteran Sri Lankan 4x4 driver Sean Hameed, the representative for RFC in Sri Lanka, was tasked by SHEMUD International to find two suitable female drivers to represent Sri Lanka in this grueling four wheel drive challenge, set in the thick of the rainforest in Negeri Sembilan, Malaysia, under extreme monsoon conditions to boot.
Familiar with her racing background and confident of her abilities, Sean approached Ashvitha with the SHEMUD proposal, and with the blessing of her father Pubudu Wickrama (a veteran Sri Lankan rallying champion and four-wheel-drive enthusiast himself), she accepted the challenge without hesitation.
Ashvitha’s first task was to find a Co- driver who was willing to take on the demanding competition beside her, and her first choice was Maryse Navaratne who also jumped at the opportunity. Already notorious figures in the Sri Lankan karting circuit as the 2015 Ladies category Champion and Runner-up respectively, Ashvitha and Maryse are teammates on Devils On Wheels, the country’s first all-female karting team.
Toyota Lanka has come in as the main sponsor with Liquimoly and Entertainment ID as the co-sponsors.
