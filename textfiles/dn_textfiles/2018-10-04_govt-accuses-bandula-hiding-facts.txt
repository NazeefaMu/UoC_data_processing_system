Govt. accuses Bandula of hiding facts

The Government replying to the claims by Joint Opposition MP Bandula Gunawardena yesterday said that the Central Bank has sold USD 184 million to defend the Rupee so far this year.
MP Gunawardena addressing a press conference on Tuesday said that the CB had released USD 157.7million to the market within a span of three days to stabilise the Rupee. In reply, Government sources pointed out that MP Gunawardena deliberately hid the fact that USD 3.7 billion was sold in 2011-2012 to defend the Rupee, but still the Rupee was depreciated by 14 percent.
