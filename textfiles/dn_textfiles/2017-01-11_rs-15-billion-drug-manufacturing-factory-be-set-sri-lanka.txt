Rs. 1.5 billion drug manufacturing factory to be set up in Sri Lanka

The Health Ministry will sign an agreement with the Japan International Corporation Agency (JICA) today to construct a Rs. 1.5 billion worth drug production factory in Sri Lanka, Health Ministry sources said.
According to the sources, the agreement will be signed at the Health Ministry in the presence of Health Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne. Annually Sri Lankan Government spends Rs. 55 Billion on importing drugs.
Only 32 drugs from a total of 12,100 drugs required for Sri Lanka are manufacturing at the State Pharmaceutical Manufacturing Corporation (SPMC) at present. With the construction of the new factory, Sri Lanka will be able to save a large amount of foreign exchange while supplying locally made high quality drugs to state hospitals, the sources said. The entire drug requirement of the country is expected to manufacture locally by 2018 and already 32 companies have signed agreements with Sri Lanka to open drug manufacturing factories in the island, the sources added.
