Customs duty concession extended to expat workers

The government has decided to further extend the Customs duty concession granted to Sri Lankan expatriate workers on their return to the country, said Customs Deputy Director Parakrama Basnayake.
He said earlier expatriate workers were granted a Customs duty concession to purchase goods to the value of USD 1,500. But now in its place, expatriate workers returning after a one-year stint would be allowed to bring in a long list of goods without any Customs duty. This includes a bathroom equipment set, bedroom furniture set, solar energy panel, computer, laptop, printer, two mobile phones, motorcycle below 350 CC engine capacity, scooter and 55-inch TV set.
Basnayake said earlier, they were allowed to bring 45-inch TV sets and one mobile phone only.
However, he would advise expatriate workers to desist from bringing air conditioners, deep freezers and TVs with screens over 55 inches.
A worker should complete at least a one-year stint abroad to qualify for this concession.
