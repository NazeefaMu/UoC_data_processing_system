Lasantha Wickrematunge murder case
Former DIG concealing  real perpetrators - SSC

The chain of incidents that led to the murder of Sunday Leader Editor Lasantha Wickrematunge has been revealed by the investigators, said Senior State Counsel (SSC) Janaka Bandara, before Mount Lavinia Chief Magistrate Mohamed Mihal, yesterday.
The SSC also stated that former DIG Prasanna Nanayakkara had not revealed the names of any persons involved in this matter. "He is concealing the real perpetrators," the SSC said.
The SSC informed the Magistrate that it was suspect if former DIG Nanayakkara had been involved in the conspiracy of this murder.
Senior President’s Counsel (SPC) Anura Maddegoda, appearing on behalf of Nanayakkara, pleaded that his client be granted bail.
While making his submission, the SPC stated that one of the journalists who wrote an article on the murder of Lasantha Wickrematunge and the assault and abduction of journalist Keith Noyahr had included the names of some high-ranking persons who are alleged to have a connection with this crime. “Has the CID recorded any statements from those persons whose names appeared in the newspaper article?” the SPC queried.
According to the further report submitted by the CID, it would record statements from those high-ranking persons.
The SPC also stated that former Inspector General of Police Jayantha Wickramaratne had filed a fundamental rights application before the Supreme Court and obtained an order preventing his arrest.
In response to Senior President’s Counsel Maddegoda’s submission, Senior State Counsel Janaka Bandara informed the Magistrate that if there was sufficient evidence against former IGP Wickramaratne, he would be arrested for destroying evidence in the Lasantha Wickrematunge murder case.
Senior State Counsel Bandara strongly objected to the suspects being granted bail. He stated that the most important facts in this case have already been discovered.
The SSC also stated that a few of the junior police officers confirmed that former DIG Nanayakkara was involved in destroying evidence.
Lasantha Wickrematunge was murdered on January 08, 2009, in Attidiya, Ratmalana, while on his way to office.
The Senior President’s Counsel stated that Nanayakkara was the Senior DIG in charge of the Western Province at the time of Wickrematunge’s murder, while Mount Lavinia was under his jurisdiction.
Mount Lavinia Chief Magistrate Mohamed Mihal yesterday ordered to further remand the suspects until June 19. The Magistrate observed that the decision to grant bail to the two suspects would be determined at the next hearing.
