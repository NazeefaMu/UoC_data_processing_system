Removing adverse travel advisories top priority-Harry

Chairman Aitkin Spence and member of the Tourism Advisory Committee, Harry Jayawardena said that removing adverse travel advisories imposed against Sri Lanka during the Kandy crisis was of top priority.
He said that due to the emergency there is a high insurance premium for tourists and in some instances some insurance companies refuse to insure tourists coming to Sri Lanka. “This is one key reason for the adverse travel advisories to remain.” With the emergency being taken off the government is now renegotiating to get these travel advisories off.
Jayawardena said that the Kandy incident happened during the Chinese New Year and this was a major blow in attracting Chinese tourists to Kandy.
He stressed that during the Kandy incident none of the tourists or even their travel vehicles were targeted or damaged. Jayawardena said that during the incident their hotels offered longer check out times and even went to the extent of offering free transport to other destinations.
