Kaduwela-Biyagama bridge to be closed temporarily

 
The Kaduwela-Biyagama bridge will be closed from 10 p.m. today until 5 a.m. tomorrow, the Police informed. 
The decision was made after it was warned following the adverse weather condition that the bridge is under serious threat of sinking due to soil erosion underneath the bridge.
