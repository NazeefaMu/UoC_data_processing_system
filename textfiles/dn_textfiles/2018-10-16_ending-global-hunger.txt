Ending Global Hunger

Ours is an unequal world. Hunger kills more people than AIDS and tuberculosis - 821 million people suffered from hunger in 2017 - 11 percent of the world population. Sixty percent of them are women. Malnutrition accounts for 45 percent of infant deaths. The number of undernourished people in the world increased for the third consecutive year in 2017.
But there are more than two billion obese people in the world, mostly in developed countries, with a substantial number in rapidly developing China and India. More than 3 million people die each year for problems linked to obesity.
This is the background in which we celebrate the World Food Day today, under the theme “End World Hunger by 2030” as part of the United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals. The Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) and the World Food Programme (WFP) will be leading this multilateral effort. This seems to be an ambitious goal, until one realizes that it is already possible to do so with a collective global effort. This year, the World Food Day aims to remind the international community of its fundamental political commitment to humanity -- the eradication of all forms of malnutrition -- and raise awareness that achieving a zero-hunger world by 2030 is still possible.
The problem is basically that much of the world does not care about hunger and malnutrition in other parts of the world. People have become desensitized and disconnected to the fact that millions of people are hungry. People need to adopt a new mindset by using the Earth’s resources more wisely, following nutritious diets, and also changing day-to-day actions with the aim of reducing waste and taking on a more sustainable lifestyle.
One fact is particularly alarming – one third of food produced is lost or wasted globally, which amounts to about 1.3 billion tons per year. This is more than enough to feed the populations of entire countries. In fact, Post Harvest Losses (PHL) are a major factor that denies access to food for more people. Losses incurred during transport and storage should be minimized by using the latest technologies for preservation. We have all heard horror stories about butter and cheese ‘mountains’ in developed countries while some people in the developing world have to scavenge for food in garbage dumps. This is clearly an untenable situation.
This will be an even more crucial factor in the decades ahead, as the world population is projected to reach 9.7 billion by 2050. That amounts to an extra 2.7 billion mouths to feed. The extent of land available for agriculture is not going to increase and there could even be a reduction as a result of desertification and Climate Change. This is a major challenge that could threaten global food security.
Scientists are already at work to address this problem. Vertical or high rise agriculture has been cited as one solution while plants that can grow without soil have also gained traction recently. This science is called hydroponics - where plants are grown without soil by using mineral nutrient solutions in a water solvent.
There already are Genetically Modified (GM) plant varieties that can produce a higher yield from the same land extent. There is no proof yet that GM crops are inherently dangerous or unsuitable for human consumption – if GM techniques help end hunger, it is an option we should pursue. In many developing countries, agriculture has still not been modernized. The use of modern equipment can increase efficiency and productivity and ultimately, the yields.
There is also an increasing case against eating meat – and not just from an ethical or religious point of view. The meat industry gobbles up an enormous amount of water, food, energy and other valuable resources and is one of the top contributors to Climate Change. Given that up to 50 billion chickens and 300 million cattle are slaughtered worldwide every year, one can imagine the scale of the resources needed by the meat industry.
In fact, it takes up to six kilos of grain to produce just 500 grammes of animal flesh. In the light of the increasing human population and the resources crunch, it will help the planet if more people go vegan. Moreover, we will have artificial meat that tastes and smells like the real thing in a few more years – scientists have already “grown” such meat in laboratories. The only barrier so far has been cost – 500 grammes of lab grown meat currently sells for around US$ 400, but the companies involved say they can bring it down to around US$ 5 in a few years, to be almost on par with actual meat. In the near future, it will even be possible to 3D print one’s own artificial meat in a commercially available food printer.
In spite of all these industrial advances, empowering the small-scale farmers and retaining the next generation of farmers for sustainable and productive farming is still the key to ending rural poverty and warding off hunger. A world free of hunger is not an impossible dream if we have the will.
