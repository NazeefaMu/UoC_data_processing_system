AVIC Astoria-platinum sponsors for SLTA event

AVIC International Hotels Lanka Limited, a subsidiary of the Aviation Industry Corporation of China (AVIC) and a Global 500 company recently extended support as platinum sponsors for the tennis Tour Tournament which was organized recently by the Tennis Association of Sri Lanka.
As part of their corporate social responsibility initiative which optimizes the essence of team work, fair play and hard work, Deputy Manager of CATIC ENG Sri Lankan Branch/President of AVIC INTL Hotels Lanka LTD, Zhong Yuan said, “This tournament is indeed a tennis event that is very influential not only in Sri Lanka but in Asia as a whole. We are greatly honoured to have become the first sponsors for this game in Sri Lanka. It is so much more than a sponsorship; as the spirit of competitive sports matches the corporate culture which AVIC upholds. We look forward to embark on more such projects with the Tennis Association of Sri Lanka in the future. We also wish the participating players all the very best in all their sporting endeavours during and after the tournament. ASTORIA will follow the event all the way and we wish this tournament great success.”
