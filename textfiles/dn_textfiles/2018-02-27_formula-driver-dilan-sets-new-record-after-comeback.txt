Eliyakande Hill Climb – 2018
Formula driver Dilan sets new record after comeback

The Motor Racing Calendar for the year 2018 got off to a flying start on Sunday when the 21st annual Eliyaknada Hill Climb organized and conducted Southern Motor Sports Club was held on a grand scale. Dilan Seneviratne who returned to the racing circuit after a lapse of three years was in fine form when he went on to erase the existing track record for the Ford Formula Cars Modified up to 1665cc climbing the Hill in only 32.24 secs.
Dilan’s drive on Sunday also was ‘the Best Time’ for the day which gave him the Fastest Drivers Trophy in addition to the record breaking Trophy awarded for the event. Dilan erased the Course record which stood at 32.61 seconds set up by his team mate Dinesh Jayawardene two years ago.
Dilan was in excellent form and was also able to carry away the winner’s Trophy for Ford Formula Cars up to 1600 cc and other special awards on offer for Fastest Driver and the Best Timer’s Award.
Former course record holder Dinesh Jayawardena though he failed in the Formula Class was at his best in the Group SL-GT up to 3500 cc class climbing the Hill clocking 33.745 seconds to be the winner ahead of Ashan Silva and Darin Weerasinghe.
Mahen Madugalle, a veteran in lighter cars did well in Group A modified class on Sunday to away Trophy awarded for event going ahead for the other divers timing clocking a time of 38.630 seconds.
Kavindu Dushan Mudalige riding in the Group SM Supermotard on a Honda CRF 250cc had the best timing for the day clocking an impressive 38.850 seconds to win the event in style and also the Best Riders’ Award on offer.
The only major incident reported on the track was Yasith Gamage’s vehicle which went off the track crashing onto a tree causing heavy damage but Yasith was lucky to escape sans injuries.
Due to intermittent rains that came down the drivers riders were not able to touch their maximum possible on their machines with the expectation of setting up new records. Full credit should go to the organizers who managed to complete the events on a high note under difficult conditions due to the unexpected rains.
