Eat less, say goodbye to wrinkles

Put down those expensive face creams. There’s a much cheaper way of fighting wrinkles - but it’s definitely not the easiest.
Eating less helps to combat the effects of ageing and protect against grey hair and stiff bones, new research suggests.
And the benefits of restricting calories can be applied all over the body - potentially allowing people to live for longer, scientists claim.
Eating less helps to combat the effects of ageing and protect against grey hair and stiff bones, according to scientists
Researchers from Brigham Young University observed two groups of mice to test the effects of calorie consumption.
One group were given unlimited access to food while the other was restricted to consume 35 per cent fewer calories.
In terms of humans, this would be the equivalent of an adult man cutting down from 2,400 advised calories a day to 1,560. The average woman would go from 2,000 to a mere 1,300.
Calorie consumption
The calorie-restricted mice were more energetic and suffered fewer diseases, the study published in Molecular & Cellular Proteomics found.
Study author Professor John Price said: ‘When you restrict calorie consumption, there’s almost a linear increase in lifespan.
‘We inferred that the restriction caused real biochemical changes that slowed down the rate of aging.’
The benefits of restricting calories can be applied all over the body - potentially allowing people to live for longer, experts claim.
‘And it’s not just that they’re living longer, but because they’re better at maintaining their bodies, they’re younger for longer as well.’
They discovered that ageing occurs at a cellular level as eating less causes ribosomes - the cell’s protein makers - to slow down.
But when they are halted, the body’s natural ageing process suffers from a slight delay too.
The decreased speed lowers production of proteins, but gives ribosomes extra time to repair themselves.
This allows the skin cells to keep functioning well, according to study author Professor John Price.
He said: ‘The ribosome is a very complex machine, sort of like your car, and it periodically needs maintenance to replace the parts that wear out the fastest.
‘When tires wear out, you don’t throw the whole car away and buy new ones. It’s cheaper to replace the tires.’
But Professor Price warned that people shouldn’t start counting calories and expect to stay young forever.
Educated decisions
However, the research could help scientists to make more educated decisions about what food is best to eat.
Calorie counting has been widely documented as a method of losing weight, but research in June suggested it may be a waste of time.
A diet, packed with ‘good’ fats such as those in olive oil, saw people lose slightly more weight than those who strictly controlled their calories.
The findings, from the University of Barcelona, fueled an ongoing row about three-decade old guidelines that say eating too much fat is linked to obesity and cardiovascular disease.

THE BENEFITS OF CUTTING CALORIES
A drastic diet to cut your daily calories by a fifth could ward off cancer and diabetes.
Scientists found it is possible to turn back the clock and live longer using extreme dieting in middle age.
In monkeys, stopping them from eating between 5pm and 8am extended their lives by 10 per cent, compared to eating normally.
University of Wisconsin researchers said the findings that dieting can fight ageing will also apply to humans, who share 93 per cent of the same genes.
