Action against private hospitals

The Health Ministry will take legal action against private hospitals and laboratories which do not implement the new reduced charges for the blood tests used to diagnose dengue fever, the Health Ministry said.
Health Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne has instructed the National Medicine Regulatory Authority (NMRA) officials to check whether the people receive the benefit of reduced prices for blood tests and submit a report to him.
Minister Rajitha Senarathne on Monday ordered the reduction of prices for blood tests relevant to diagnose Dengue.
All private hospitals are required to implement the new prices and issue the blood reports to the patients within half an hour.
The reduced price of a Full Blood Count (FBC) is Rs.250 and Dengue Antigen Test (NS1) is Rs.1000. These reduced prices are valid until further notice, he said.
NMRA officials will inspect private hospitals to find out whether the hospitals charge the reduced prices for the blood tests, he added.
