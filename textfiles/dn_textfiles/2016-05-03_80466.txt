TRACKED FOR FITNESS

Jogging Track Project in Gampaha district is becoming very popular. I perceive this project as a combined effort of engineers, ecologists and sociologists. Engineering solutions proposed in this project addresses flood mitigation along riverine environments while forming a narrow track along the bank with dredging operation to clean streams.
These tracks could be used as access to the riverbanks. There was no net loss in flood retention area in forming tracks because the required earth for tracks was obtained only from the vicinity. Earth was secured from outside only when it was necessary to improve the surface of the track to a jogging track. Tree plantation along stream banks introduced under the project mainly addresses Ecological needs such as enhancement of Bio Diversity in urban areas and reactivation of Bio Corridors for local wild habitat.
Creation of walking paths/ jogging track is an added social benefit addressing health aspects of urban communities who are suffering from various illnesses such as hypertension and Diabetes. Creating community awareness about the beauty of maintaining clean riverine environment, and the role of biodiversity in urban environments is another long-term social benefit.
Some sections of the banks could even be transformed into cycle tracks for urban communities as Environment-Friendly Transport (EST) systems. It is also expected that community members who regularly visit the tracks would become watchdogs of their natural environment especially the water resource which is becoming polluted at very rapid rate in urban setups because streams have become dumping sites of urban wastes.
Gampaha Jogging Track project
In this project, jogging track is popularly highlighted as the main benefit. However it is only a side benefit of macro level project targeting whole natural environment. For example, if you consider the master plan behind Gampaha Jogging Track project, it is planned to be a bio corridor commencing from the catchment area of Uruwal Oya around Plikuutuwa to Muthurajawela Wetland.
When this corridor traverses close to human-populated areas - in this case Gampaha Town - corridor was sophisticated as a jogging track by hard landscaping.
However, the project is basically an environmental project delivering benefits to the whole district. It is in fact an urban bio corridor addressing the needs of all living beings. Similar to highways connecting cities of human beings, bio corridors are the roads for the rest of the living beings connecting isolated forest patches in urban areas.
Dredging of streams is the conventional way of flood mitigation adapted by SLRDC. Plantation of trees along stream banks is a new concept introduced under this project implemented in parallel to dredging operations. Once a Riparian Trees are grown along stream reservations, stream banks become strengthened and soil erosion get minimised. Otherwise eroded soil gets deposited in downstream areas and the flood mitigatory effect gets gradually diminished with time. Riparian tree varieties such as Kumbuk and Karanda are ideal for stabilizing riverbanks. On the other hand, riparian tree belts also control the flood peaks.
Usually trees are being planted along side the road. However in this case it is streams. This is not the first time it was tried in Sri Lanka. Same concept was introduced in System B of Mahaweli Project in 1995. However the main objective of that project was to prevent farmers doing cultivation within reservations of natural streams. Under that project, trees such as Kumbuk, Karanda and Bamboo were introduced to the water edge of streams and fruit trees were established at the edge of reservations bordering paddy fields. Farmers adjacent to streams (riparian farmers) enjoyed the user right of trees planted bordering their boundary. These riparian belts were also designed to play a role of bio corridors connecting isolated forest patches within agriculture landscapes.
Implementation phase usually is three years until the newly planted riparian trees are fully established. Jogging part covers only a short stretch of the river bank. Balance is a riparian bio corridor. Maintenance of the jogging path sections is a responsibility of local authorities.
There is no need to maintain balance section after three years, because it will become a part of the nature with time. However, if the jogging section is not maintained it will also eventually transform into a bio corridor and the community will miss the chance of reaping benefits of the project. Therefore community also will have a responsibility to maintain it by organizing themselves or through local institutes such as Urban Councils.
Local authorities such as Urban Council of Gampaha are capable of doing maintenance. That is their responsibility.
This is a new challenge for them especially because jogging path is becoming very popular among taxpayers who finance the salaries of those councils. Average number of visitors per day for Gampaha is more than 100. For Kiribathgoda it is even more. Therefore recreation is a need of urban community. May be, councils could get lessons from other countries to address the new challenge. In my view the political leaderships of our local bodies such as Urban Councils should be creative enough to raise funds for such community-oriented projects by involving private sector institutes, companies and banks within their command area. Those institutes have a social responsibility of supporting local institutes such as Urban Councils.
Climate change
Fresh water availability is becoming gradually diminishing in whole world. Though Gampaha is located in wet zone, global issues such climate change affects this region too. The statement of King Parakramabahu not to send a drop of water to sea without using is applicable to Gampaha too.
The present approach adapted by SLRDC focusing only the flood mitigation should be revised addressing the issues during drought situations too.
For that, there is need to have joint effort of Water Board, Environment Authority and Irrigation Department. This project provided ideal stage to deliver their services in broader prospective addressing the community needs in a holistic way because rivers and natural stream belong to the whole community. What the community needs is a service addressing whole cross section of them in multi-disciplinary way rather than restricting to a single objective.
Unless political leadership digests the importance of preserving natural environment, nothing will materialise. The role of implementation agency in coordinating various agencies responsible for water resource (Irrigation Dept, Agrarian) is also important.
