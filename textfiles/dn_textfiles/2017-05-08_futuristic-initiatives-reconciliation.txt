Futuristic initiatives for reconciliation

A national policy on reconciliation and coexistence submitted by the President as Minister of National Integration and Reconciliation and Minister Mano Ganeshan as Minister of National Coexistence, Dialogue, and Official Languages was approved by Cabinet last week.
It was long overdue. The seeds of which was originated during the period of government led by President Rajapaksa when three sitting MPs and three civic activists combined and drafted which though circulated widely and submitted to the then President remained a draft.
The policy approved now has several salient features.
The preamble refers to the suffering and impact on lives due social and political tension, including conflict that spanned three decades; acknowledges the breakdown of trust, intolerance and prejudice between and within communities; refers to the lack of an acceptable arrangement of shared political authority that has manifested itself in discontent and violence at different periods in the history of the country; identifies the lack of equal access to opportunity ranging from, but not limited to, education, livelihoods, employment and justice as a major cause of discontent in the country; lays out remedies ranging from strengthening civil administration and, return of property and lands to rightful owners; promoting media freedom, generating livelihood opportunities; and protecting the rights and interest of missing and disappeared persons and their relatives; promotes national coexistence by strengthening the Sri Lankan identity; recognizing the diversity and cultural pluralism through policy, law, education and practice towards respecting the rights of persons to language and cultural heritage; the notion of nationhood to foster a stronger sense of togetherness of all Sri Lankans through dialogue, arbitration and activities prevent reoccurrences of marginalization and conflicts; resolves to implement the languages policy and law, extensively throughout the country in the state and private sectors and among the citizenry; pledging to combat impunity and uphold the rule of law; affirms that a process of healing has to take place in a holistic manner both individually for victims of conflict and violence, and collectively at the level of communities and societies that have suffered; recognizes the importance of developing a national narrative of the past that resonates with all communities in Sri Lanka; calls for a whole-of-government effort and a multi-stakeholder process that combines a two-pronged approach, namely preventive through ensuring non-recurrence of past events, and through futuristic initiatives for reconciliation.
OBJECTIVES
* To function as a state policy on reconciliation and coexistence.
* To provide direction to national reconciliation and coexistence by addressing past violence and conflict, and through envisioning of a shared future that fosters national unity and peaceful coexistence among all peoples and communities in the country.

• Fast track affirmative action programs for the marginalized by - ensuring every such person is afforded standards set out in Sustainable Development Goals (SDG’s) which form the policy. Practically ensuring all who lost out on education is offered adult education options on concessionary terms, homeless, unemployed/without means to a livelihood, with health afflictions or suffering from Trauma are given speedy special attention NOW.
