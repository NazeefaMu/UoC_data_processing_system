Russell Westbrook breaks NBA record

Russell Westbrook recorded the highest-scoring triple-double in NBA history on Wednesday night, totaling 57 points, 13 rebounds and 11 assists to lead Oklahoma City Thunder to a come-from-behind, 114-106 overtime road victory over Orlando Magic.
For Westbrook, it was just another day at the office as he compiled his fourth consecutive triple-double and his 38th of the season, leaving him three shy of the NBA record held by NBA legend Oscar Robertson. The 57 points were one short of his career high.
‘You just got to want it more than other people,’ Westbrook said. ‘I don’t think about getting tired. I just keep going and going. I don’t think about it. I just think about making the next play, making winning basketball plays. I’m blessed.’ The Thunder (43-31) have won eight of the last 10 games. Westbrook scored 16 points in the fourth quarter on Monday when OKC erased a 13-point deficit in the final 3:31 to win in Dallas. He scored 19 points in the final six minutes of regulation to force overtime on Wednesday when the Thunder erased another 13-point fourth quarter deficit.
