Navy finds stock of Kerala cannabis in northern seas

Naval personnel on the Fast Attack Craft in the Northern Naval Command found 39 parcels of 83.5 kg Kerala cannabis at 8 nautical miles in the seas north of Kankesanthurai on Saturday.
The cannabis had been packed in 39 parcels and it is suspected that the consignment had been dumped at sea to be transferred them ashore later.
The detection is one of the largest of its kind in recent times. The cannabis stock is said to have a street value of over Rs. 10 million.
The parcels of cannabis were handed over to Kankesanthurai Police, a Navy spokesman said.
