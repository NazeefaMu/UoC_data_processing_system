Sebs emerge Under 19 limited over champions

 
St.Sebastian's College, Moratuwa who beat Royal College Colombo in pre-quarter finals, Isipathana in quarters, Ananda in semis finally became the Champions of Singer Under 19 all-island limited over tourney 2016 recording a tremendous four wicket win over defending champions, Trinity College Kandy in the finals concluded on Friday at R Premadasa Stadium.
Trinity won the toss and took the first lease on a lively surface at R.Premadasa, but their strong batting lineup failed to do anything special against St.Sebastian's attack that maintained a tight line and length throughout the Trinity's innings in which only all-rounder Raveen Sayer resisted with a well compiled 69. Avishka Fernando bowled a match-winning spell claiming three wickets for just 11 runs whilst Asher Warnakulasooriya and Praveen Jayawickrama played a supporting role bagging two wickets apiece.
St.Sebastian's chasing a modest target of 167 lost a few wickets earlier on before Sandaruwan Fernando and Nimesh Bandara shared a gallant unbroken partnership for the seventh wicket taking their side home with a staggering six overs to spare to win this all-important finals by four wickets in the end. Avishka Fernando scored 27 following his three wickets with the ball whilst Sandaruwan and Nimesh remained unbeaten on 62 and 22 respectively.
Trinity attack led by Shanogeeth Shanmuganathan with a good spell of 3 for 14 bowled well at the top but they failed to maintain the same grip towards the end.
Sandaruwan Fernando of St.Sebstian's was adjudged the player of the match for his match-winning score of 62 not out.
Trinity : 166 in 49 overs (Raveen Sayer 69, Shavindu Amarasinghe 33, Shanogeeth Shanmuganadan 21, Avishka Fernando 3/11, Asher Warnakulasooriya 2/49, Praveen Jayawickrama 2/17)

Avishka's ton puts St. Sebastian's in finals
