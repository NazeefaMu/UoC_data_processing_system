Unity Government ensured nation’s well-being: Minister

The nation voted the Good Governance Government into power in hopes that it would establish a fair political system, Irrigation, Water Resources and Disaster Management Minister Duminda Dissanayake said.
He said that the coalition of the United National Party (UNP) and the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) was a sign that unity could exist even amidst the political violence that prevailed in the country.
The UNP and SLFP did have disagreements, but they had still been able to work together to ensure the development of the country, as well as the well-being of its people, Minister Dissanayake said.
The minister said that when President Maithripala Sirisena and other SLFPers allied with the UNP, it was to stay true to the values of the Sri Lanka Freedom Party by ridding the country of the oppression that pervaded it during the previous regime.
“I believe that the Good Governance Government will endure until 2020, “ he said, adding that the Opposition only knew to conduct marches and protests, while spreading false rumours in order to deceive and distract the public.
The most recent rumour was that of the plans to form a caretaker government, which was ludicrous, the minister said. It was but a poor strategy to instigate the nation against the government, he added.
