Ministers, Deputies galore: Tylvin

 
Two more Deputy Ministers and a State Minister were appointed by the government on Wednesday. This is a very grave situation. The appointment of ministers has become a joke today. Even the government cannot give a proper count of the number of Ministers, State and Deputy Ministers because it is unpredictable like the weather pattern today, JVP Secretary Tylvin Silva said.
The government has been appointing new Ministers, Deputy and State Ministers at a rate since last August, the JVP Secretary said.
Addressing a press conference at JVP headquarters in Battaramulla, Silva said the government seemed to be acting against the people's mandate.
The number of Cabinet Ministers in the Rajapaksa Cabinet exceeded 100. The appointment of Ministers for the sake of stabilising the government's position is wrong. Ministers should be appointed according to the country's development needs, he said.
Earlier, civil organisations and the JVP opposed the culture of appointing ministers and said the number of ministers should be categorically spelled out in the constitution. This suggestion was accepted even by President Maithripala Sirisena at that juncture, Silva said.
Silva said when the 19th amendment to the constitution was adopted during the 100 day government, section 46.1 specifically stated that the number of Ministers should not exceed beyond 30 and State and Deputy Ministers should not exceed 40. But the government later circumvented this by adding a clause that Parliament can make a discussion on the number of Ministers when a national government is formed, he said.
Silva said today the prices of goods had sky rocketed during the New Year season.
"Instead of providing relief to the people, the government had started gifting Parliamentarians with ministerial posts," he said.
Silva said he wished to question the government about the scientific basis on which it appointed Ministers and Deputy Ministers.
