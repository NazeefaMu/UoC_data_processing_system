Step into your favourite stories…

Calling all bookworms! Do you love combining your creative side with your love of reading? If so you will find a variety of whimsical bookmarks by MyBOOKmark.
These bookmarks feet-ure a charming cast of characters that come to life when pressed between the pages of a book. Though only their little legs are visible, you won’t have to read between the lines to guess who’s who. Each leggy marker showcases the well-known looks of some of literature’s most famous figures, from the Wicked Witch’s signature striped stockings and ruby slippers to Alice’s iconic blue-and-white color scheme.
Additionally, some of the bookmarks showcase the legs of less specific characters, including a graceful ballerina, shimmering mermaid, and beguiling magician “for those who still believe in the magical world, at least between the book pages.”
Each pair of legs is crafted out of polymer clay and painted with vibrant acrylics. So much more than a placeholder, each eye-catching bookmark is bound to pop from the pages and make your favorite book even more fun.
