Due to MP Gunawardena’s derogatory remarks: Lottery tickets down by 15% : LDA Secy

Secretary to the Lottery Dealers' Association(LDA) B.S.S Madarasinghe, condemned remarks made by MP Bandula Gunawardena concerning the National Lotteries Board.
“The percentage of sales have gone down by 15 percent as a result of his derogatory remarks made against the National Lotteries Board,” he said, addressing the media yesterday in Colombo. More recently, MP Gunawardena told the media that the public trust over lotteries had breached for the first time in history, following the Rs 5 levy imposed on lotteries by the 2017 Budget. He further alleged that although the President ordered the Lotteries Board to reduce the price of lottery tickets back to Rs 20, retailers were still selling lottery tickets at Rs 30. Madarasinghe said lottery sales have been good since January 2015. “There are a few issues. But discussions are taking place to solve them,” he said.
He further said that Gunawardena had made these remarks when the unions had finally found a solution to the problem by talking to the President. “The Lotteries Board had been enriching the lives of the people. The main objective of the board was to assist the government to raise finances,” Minuwangoda Provincial Councilor W.N. P Ariyadhasa said.
He said that Gunwardena failed to speak about the corruption that took place before the 2015 Presidential election in the Lotteries Boards.
