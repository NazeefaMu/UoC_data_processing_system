Leisure Shopping

Colombo is getting to be a pretty fashionable capital city. Here are a few stylish individuals we spotted out in Colombo on a sunny weekday morning. Shifani Reffai asked them for a little insight into their looks.
1. We were lucky enough to bump into fashion designer Abhisheka Wimalaweera, who surprised us with her very minimal kurta and jeans, in a city that’s increasingly sporting a more Western look. “We’ve all got different body shapes - and you need to be mindful of your own when you’re picking out an outfit,” she advised.
2. Shehan sports a classic monochrome look, both youthful and trendy. He and his friends look up to the styles of famed footballer and model David Beckham.
3. Kavindi, Shialin, Prasansha and Chamodi generally like the high waist look. It’s different from the mainstream style in Colombo. Some of the looks they admire are the ones flaunted by Sonam Kapoor, Naomi Campbell and the runway shows featuring Victoria Secret models.
4. Amalan says he usually makes sure there are prints on his clothes, whether flora or trees or whatever else. When asked about his style he said “I guess this is kind of the semi-hipster look.”
5. Shivanthi and Leah are from the UK and were caught unaware enjoying the sun in their bright, summer get-ups. When asked about their choice of colourful cottons, they said, “Because it’s comfy!”
