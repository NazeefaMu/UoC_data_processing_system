A boost for investment

Foreign Direct Investments (FDI) are essential for any developing country to strengthen the economy and create jobs. Sri Lanka, which liberalized its economy exactly 40 years ago, is known as a premier investment destination in South Asia. However, various factors including volatile global economic conditions can sometimes hamper the FDI inflow to developing countries.
There is intense competition for FDI among developing nations. This is why Sri Lanka must offer the right projects and the right investment climate for foreign investors. In other words, our ‘product’ must be unique and different.
Sri Lanka now has a great opportunity to reinvigorate its FDI prospects thanks to a slew of foreign investment projects led by the US$ 1.1 billion Hambantota Port agreement with a Chinese company. According to Central Bank Governor Dr. Indrajit Coomaraswamy, the Hambantota Port project alone will generate around US$ 400 million in investments in the next few months.
International ratings agency Moody’s has said the port deal was credit-positive for Sri Lanka and could help the island reduce its debt servicing and build foreign reserves. The Port deal has generated a lot of interest in Sri Lanka’s investment potential. Moreover, US$ 388 million has flowed into Government Securities and another US$ 246 million to the Colombo Stock Exchange. The International Sovereign Bond floated in March was seven times oversubscribed.
As the Governor rightly points out, Sri Lanka needs enhanced investments for economic growth and there are no short cuts for that. Sri Lanka should create an investor-friendly climate and build investor confidence, stresses the Governor. It is also vital for the domestic private sector to be more robust for growth to pick up.
There are a few other recently announced high-profile projects and business concerns which are ideal candidates for FDI. Among them are the planned divestiture of 51 per cent of Hotel Developers Lanka (Owner of Colombo Hilton property in Colombo Fort) and all of Canwill Holdings (Pvt) Limited (owner of 49-storey Grand Hyatt property in Kollupitiya) currently valued at US$ 240 million. Talks are also reported to be underway on finding a strategic partner for the loss-making SriLankan Airlines, with at least two well-known airlines in the fray.
Creating a climate conducive to investments is very important. The Board of Investment (BoI) was established with this aim in mind, but even the BoI has not been able to totally eliminate the copious amount of red tape involved. Some investors, driven from pillar to post, have left the country and taken their investments to countries such as Vietnam and Bangladesh. This aspect should be addressed and investors should get a seamless experience from the time they come in with the proposal to the opening of their FDI project(s).
There was one other “hidden factor” that had driven investors away – corruption. Many foreign investment projects launched during the previous Government’s tenure were grossly overestimated, with the additional amount reflecting the corruption element. There should be no room for corruption at any level in the approval process for FDI.
Foreign Investment should not be considered as a panacea for all ills. Sometimes all we need to have are better managed enterprises, public or private. There is no debate that certain loss-making and debt-ridden state-owned enterprises should be restructured and streamlined to serve the public in a better way.
Public Private Partnerships (PPPs) are also an ideal solution. The Government is keen to explore PPPs in transport, utilities, ports, tourism, construction, housing, health care, financial services, information technology and mining and minerals sector. Former BoI veteran Thilan Wijesinghe has been appointed to spearhead the PPPs which will not involve privatization at any stage.
Projects in the pipeline include the elevated highway from the new Kelani Bridge to Athurugiriya, the underground road to extend Marine Drive connecting with the port access road, inland water-based transport and inland air transport, light rail transit, utility projects in water, waste to energy, and industrial zones. These are massive projects that the State alone cannot handle which require a huge quantum of funds and PPPs are a viable option.
Sri Lanka should seek more foreign investments in the power and energy sector, given the imperative need to phase out thermal power and rely more on renewable energy. Fossil fuels, with the exception of coal, are generally expected to run out in the next 100 years. In this backdrop, several alternative energy projects have already been announced by the Government. Concessions and incentives should be granted to local and foreign investors who seek to implement wind, solar and even ocean wave energy projects. This will help reduce the massive fuel import bill which exceeds US$ 6 billion a year.
There was a downward trend in global FDI last year to US$ 1.52 trillion, but an improved economic outlook this year could help turn things around and boost global FDIs to US$ 1.8 trillion, according to the latest UNCTAD reports. Sri Lanka must position itself as a gateway to South Asia and indeed, Asia itself to secure a bigger slice of this global investment pie.
