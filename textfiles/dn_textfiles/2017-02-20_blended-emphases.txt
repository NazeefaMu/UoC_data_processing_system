Blended emphases

Hidden and almost forgotten in the recesses of Borella cemetery lie between fifteen and twenty gravestones marked with Hebrew script. These tombs are among the last signs of the complex, fading history of Jews in Sri Lanka, a history that dates back over 1000 years.Though sequential bouts of colonisation have erased much of the history of Jews on the island, a few shards of evidence and rumours of varying trustworthiness survive today.
Danny Perera
A 9th century Sinhalese king allegedly had four Jewish advisers in his court. In the 10th century, the Persian traveller Abu Zeid al Hasan, reported that he had encountered many Jews while staying in Sri Lanka. And 200 years later Benjamin of Tudela, a Jewish adventurer from Spain, wrote that he had found around 3000 Jews living in Sri Lanka.While the fate of those early Jewish communities is unclear, they most likely assimilated once the Portuguese arrived and have since blended into the population. So it follows that a good people with Jewish ancestors are living in Sri Lanka though the vast majority do not know it.
However, during the colonization, waves of European Jews accompanied both Portuguese and Dutch to Sri Lanka to escape persecution. JB Müller, a deceased journalist and researcher on Sri Lanka’s Burghers, believed that many Burghers have Jewish roots due to the influx of Jews during the early colonial times.Several common Sri Lankan names have Jewish roots; “de Fonseka” might be the progeny of those named “de Fonseca,” a name closely linked to Portuguese Jews.
But the Burghers either converted or lost the knowledge of their Jewish ancestry, and there is no any semblance of a Sri Lankan Jewish community any longer.
While Sri Lanka has scant extant proof to back up these particular claims of Jewish arrival, a functioning Synagogue was on Galle Road, just opposite the Cinnamon Grand. Anne Ranasinghe, the famous Sri Lankan Jewish Poet, wrote that Jewish troops in the British Army used the Synagogue during the World War II. It was demolished sometime during the 1950s or early 1960s.
Though Sri Lanka lacks a community of practising local Jews, a Chabad House, akin to a Jewish community and religious center, has sprung up on Ananda Coomaraswamy Mawatha, just across the street from Cinnamon Red.
Chabad House
Given the dearth of Sri Lankan Jews, the Chabad House caters to a small number of Jewish transplants living in Colombo and to Jewish travellers, mostly Israeli, but also French, British, and American.

Founded just before the end of the war, the House is run by Rabbi Shneor Maidanchik. Though it might seem akin to a Christian mission, the Chabad House is not meant to convert anyone. The Rabbi himself doesn’t proselytise, but he does hold services every Friday for Shabbat and on each Jewish Holiday.“The Chabad House serves as both a Synagogue and meeting place for Jews who live here and who pass through,” Maidanchik said. “We get people from all over who come to surf, do business, or buy gems, tea, and coconut products. I see myself as an ambassador of the Jewish faith to Sri Lanka.”
The House has a kosher restaurant at which anyone can eat. It is also the site of Sri Lanka’s only Mikveh, or bath used for ritual immersion in Jewish practice.A second Chabad House also rotates between Hikkaduwa and Arugam Bay depending on the season.
“It’s my goal to host Jewish people and make them feel comfortable and at home here,” Maidanchik said.Ziv Molcho, an Israeli, who has lived in Sri Lanka for 10 years and runs a travel company, noted that the Chabad House is an important gathering place for Jewish people both living in and passing through the country.
“It’s a nice, safe place to gather for and celebrate holidays together and to eat good, Jewish food,” Molcho said. He said he does not come to every Friday Shabbat service, but he talks to the Rabbi every day and tries to learn from him.“It’s very nice to have a group of familiar faces who meet from time to time and have interesting discussions,” said Shmuel Kenigsberg, who first came to Colombo to set up fish and tea businesses over 15 years ago.
While Jews all over the world often face racism and anti-semitism, Molcho noted that he has not experienced such problems in Sri Lanka.“I have had no trouble being Jewish here. I’m glad to have a good relationship with my neighbours, and I have faced no problems after telling people that I’m Jewish or that I’m from Israel,” he said.
“Most Sri Lankans don’t know much about Judaism. Many think it’s a form of Christianity. It’s confusing for them,” he said.
The Last Lankan Jew?
Though a functioning community of Sri Lankan Jews has not been for a long time, Sri Lanka had famous Jews. The first people to cultivate coffee, and then tea in Sri Lanka were the Jewish - Austrian de Worms brothers. Several British Jews held high positions in the colonial administration as well.Musaeus College is named after Marie Musaeus Higgins, A Jewish woman from Germany. But the most notable Sri Lankan Jew of recent times is undoubtedly poet Anne Ranasinghe, who died just two months ago. After fleeing Germany during the World War II and ending up in England, she married a Sri Lankan professor of medicine and moved to Colombo, where she enjoyed great literary success.
Chabad House
Ranasinghe referred to herself as the only Sri Lankan Jew, but this is only half true. A Jew at birth, she later became Sri Lankan. Danny Perera, on the other hand, was born a Buddhist Sri Lankan, but has since converted to Judaism.Perera grew up in Mount Lavinia in the 1950s surrounded by Jewish people. His parents rented rooms to Jews who had fled the Holocaust, and his uncle, who had served in the British Army during World War II, married an Egyptian Jew before moving back to Sri Lanka.
“Though I didn’t know it at the time, many of my friends were Jewish, and my aunt kept a Kosher house, so I grew up around Jewish people,” Perera said.In 1972, he decamped to the Friedrich-Alexander University in Erlangen to study German. Upon his arrival, he realised that he would be sharing his student apartment with several Jews.
“I was the only non-Jew in that dorm, and the others told me that I should go to Israel. My uncle and his wife had moved there with their children in 1967, and I met them down there in 1978,” Perera said.“I stayed with them for quite some time. They didn’t want me to leave, and then I found an Israeli girlfriend. She didn’t make me convert, but I thought that I should learn about Judaism if I am going to live in Israel.”
After taking a six-month course on Jewish religion in Jerusalem, he approached a rabbi about converting. The Rabbi questioned Perera’s motives at length, even asking why he would want to be a member of a group that has suffered so much over the years, the Rabbi gave his permission and Perera converted.“I was very interested in Jewish history and customs. The religion has a very long history, and I find that it keeps the generations and families together. It’s a difficult religion and it has a difficult history, but I wanted to be a part of it,” he said.
Perera was then promptly drafted into the Israeli Defence Forces (IDF), and, after doing a year plus of training, he served for 45 days a year for 15 years, seeing action several times. During his time in the IDF, Perera married his girlfriend Abiba and had two children. He also opened seven garment factories that specialised in dying fabric.
After living in Tel Aviv for over 20 years, Perera decided to move back to Sri Lanka in 2000.“I couldn’t keep up with the Chinese in the garment industry. Their prices were too low, so I decided to move back and open up a fish-processing factory. I sent my first shipment of fish to Israel, though” he said.
His children and wife still live in Tel Aviv, but Perera has thrown himself into helping the Chabad House thrive. It was by chance that he ran into Mendy Kromby, the Rabbi, who set up the House about eight years ago.“I was in Hikkaduwa, and I saw a Rabbi walking in the road. I stopped and asked him what he’s doing there, and he said he wanted to set up a Chabad house. I thought this was a great idea, and I helped him set it up. The property is registered to me, and I helped get the necessary visas,” he said.
Central to Perera’s project at Chabad House is to create a legitimate Jewish community in Colombo.“It’s not a big deal that I’m converted, because Judaism feels very natural to me. I want to build a Jewish society in Sri Lanka. That is what I’m fighting for. Because I know that Jewish people have lived in this country for a long time,” he said.
“I’m the only Sri Lankan Jew, the only Sri Lankan guy who also has an Israeli passport.”
