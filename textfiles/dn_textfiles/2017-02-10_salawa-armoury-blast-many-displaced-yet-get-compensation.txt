Salawa armoury blast: Many displaced yet to get compensation

Although eight months have passed since the Salawa armoury blast, a majority of the displaced and affected people have not received compensation as promised, Salawa Janatha Pavura Organisation Secretary Mahesh Kumarasinghe said.
He was addressing a media briefing held in the area to highlight the plight of the members of his organisation who were displaced by the Salawa blast.
Kumarasinghe said even though the authorities promised to exempt affected people from the electricity, water and telephone bills, they are still receiving the bills from the institutions as before. He said people, whose partly damaged houses were hastily repaired by the Army, find it difficult to live in them as the cracks have reappeared due to a roughshod job.
He said there is such a fear psychosis among their children that they get agitated even for the sound of a fire cracker. He said only Rs. 100,000 was paid to the family of one person buried under a collapsing wall of his house. He said when they complain that compensation payments were inadequate, the Divisional Secretary of the area ask the applicants to go to court if they object to the government valuation. He said high handed action of certain officials were messing up things harming the government's good intentions.
