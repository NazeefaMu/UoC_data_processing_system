‘Barbie’ movie moves to 2020

The release of Anne Hathaway starrer live-action 'Barbie' movie has been moved from this year to 2020. Reportedly, the film, which was earlier scheduled to hit the theater on August 8, 2018, will now release on May 8, 2020, Sony announced.
This is the second date change for 'Barbie.' The studio had originally dated the movie for June 29, 2018, then moved it back six weeks. Australian filmmaker Alethea Jones is slated to direct the project, which has long been in development at Sony and previously had Amy Schumer in the lead role.
Amy Pascal, Walter F. Parkes and Laurie MacDonald are producing the project based on the classic Barbie mythology. ANI
