Bus fares to come down

The newly appointed Minister of Transport and Civil Aviation Arjuna Ranatunge yesterday promised to make every effort to reduce bus fares shortly.
“With the fuel prices coming down in a big way, I will make every effort to reduce bus fares as well accordingly” the minister said addressing a public event in Veyangoda.
The minister said he will initiate talks with relevant stakeholders next week to reduce bus fares.
On the re-introduction of the fuel pricing formula, the minister said although some sections criticized it earlier due to misunderstandings, the people today were reaping the benefits with prices in the world market coming down.
Finance Minister Mangala Samaraweera ordered the reduction of fuel prices from midnight Friday (21) and accordingly, the price of a litre of 92 and 95 Octane petrol was reduced by Rs.10 and a litre of Auto Diesel by Rs.5 and Super Diesel by Rs.10.
