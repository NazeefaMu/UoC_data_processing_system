Apple to inject USD 350 bn into US economy in next 5 yrs

Apple has announced that it will invest and spend about USD 350 billion in the United States in the next five years creating some 20,000 jobs in the country.
Already the largest US taxpayer, Apple anticipates repatriation tax payments of approximately USD 38 billion as required by the recent changes to the tax law. A payment of that size would likely be the largest of its kind ever made, the Silicon Valley based company said in a statement.
“Apple is a success story that could only have happened in America, and we are proud to build on our long history of support for the US economy,” said Tim Cook, Apple’s CEO. “We believe deeply in the power of American ingenuity, and we are focusing our investments in areas where we can have a direct impact on job creation and job preparedness. We have a deep sense of responsibility to give back to our country and the people who help make our success possible,” he said in a statement. According to a company statement, Apple plans to establish a new campus in a new location, which will initially house technical support for customers.
