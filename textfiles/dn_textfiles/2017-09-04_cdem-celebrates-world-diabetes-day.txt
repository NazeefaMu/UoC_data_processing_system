CDEM celebrates World Diabetes Day

The centre for diabetes endocrinology and cardio-metabolism (CDEM) will be celebrating the World Diabetes Day which falls on November 14.
World diabetes day is significant to CDEM in many ways. Being a premier centre for diabetes and first specialty facility in Sri Lanka for diabetes CDEM has a duty to treat diabetes, prevent complications of diabetes and screen for diabetes. The CDEM was opened by President Maithripala Sirisena on world diabetes day, in 2016.
CDEM ensures the free glucose testing during the months of September, October and November. We are keener to get down those who do not know they have diabetes. Diabetes as a disease has very few symptoms and signs and one can have high blood glucose for a long period unnoticed. Still high glucose levels continue to damage heart, brain, eyes, kidneys, feet and lower limbs.
The CDEM is determined to serve you and look after you totally. One in ten persons have diabetes with or without your knowledge. For unknown we serve by finding whether they have diabetes. For known we see whether their glucose is controlled.
In keeping with the theme “Looking after lives” CDEM plans many more activities towards the month of November for world diabetes day. They include free diabetes clinics, foot screening, more discounts on packages and educational programmes.
CDEM invites you to enjoy the free glucose testing from September 1.
