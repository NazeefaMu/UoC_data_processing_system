Meet the Hong Kong: Treat That's Taking: New York by Storm

This year has been a banner year for Asian-style ice cream in NYC. This Summer, 10 Below Rolled Ice Cream, a Thai-style street food, had Manhattanites lining up in droves for a taste. If its reception at the Grub Street Food Festival is any indication, Eggettes NY, will be the next trendsetting ice cream spot. While a brick-and-mortar shop is currently under construction, Eggettes NY is due to open in Chinatown soon and will sell gai daan jai (otherwise known as eggettes), a traditional Hong Kong street treat similar to a Belgian waffle in texture, with a unique bubbled shape.
Patrons of the shop will be able to order the eggettes on their own in four flavors — original, chocolate, green tea, and pumpkin spice — as well as part of an ice cream cone. Here's how to make the eggettes at home. PopSugar
INGREDIENTS:
1 cup all-purpose flour
1 tsp baking powder
1/2 tbsp tapioca starch
1 tbsp custard powder
2 large eggs
2/3 cup granulated white sugar
2 tbsp evaporated milk
150 ml water
1 tbsp vegetable oil
1 tsp vanilla extract
DIRECTIONS:
Matcha Eggette Cone With Green Tea Ice Cream, Oreos, Blueberries, and Chocolate Syrup
*In a large bowl, add all ingredients and mix with a whisk until only very small lumps remain. Set batter in fridge for one hour.
*Read instructions on whether your pan can be placed directly onto stove or if it needs a wire rack and do accordingly. Pre-heat each half of the waffle pans on medium-high heat until hot (about 1-2 minutes).
*Lightly brush each pan with vegetable oil (don't use spray). Turn heat to medium (I set mine at dial at
*Pour 3/4 cup of the batter into the middle of the egg waffle pan and then immediately flip pan, making sure to hold pan together tightly so it doesn't leak. Cook for 2 minutes, then flip to other side and cook for 2 minutes. The egg waffle will now require one more cook on each side. Timing may vary depending on stove, but mine needed 2 more minutes on each side. (You first waffle will like still be pale yellow and may have cooked unevenly. Like the first pancake, this is your throwaway one. The ones after should look light brown when they are finished.)
*Remove the side of the pan the finished egg waffle is clinging to, and hold it above a plate with the waffle upside down,. Using a chopstick or spoon, gently loosen it from the pan, starting on the top edge, using gravity to help it release. It will start to curl as it falls off and you should be able to get it out in one piece (except for the first waffle).
*Repeat with the remaining batter (re-greasing pans first) and then serve immediately.
