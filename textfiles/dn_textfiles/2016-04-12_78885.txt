Madura and Jeewanthika does Seetha Devi proud

 
Two old girls of Seetha Devi Girls College, Kandy will be the captain and vice captain of the Sri Lanka Ladies Team for the World League Hockey Championship which is being played in Singapore from April 11 to 23.
The Captain of the national ladies team will be Madura Dharmaratne and the Vice Captain will be Jeewanthika Keerthiratne. Their appointment to these two top positions is a big honour to the hill capital which has shown tremendous progress in girls hockey with Seetha Devi Girls College showing the way followed by St. Anthony’s Girls College and Pushpadana Girls College and now Mahamaya Girls College is making a grand revival.
But the credit should go to Seetha Devi Girls College who introduced hockey in 1991 with M.A.M. Ashroff as its pioneers coach and still continuous to coach them and under his guidance for the last 25 years they have won over 170 championship titles at various age group levels at various tournaments. This is a record which cannot be easily broken with many schools in Kandy, Matale and Colombo playing the game in a big way.
Amiable Madura Dharmaratne is a player pleasant to watch and has fine qualities of leadership. Her choice as the captain is a good one as she is very popular among her team mates with her friendly ways.
Madura Dharmaratne plays in the pivotal position of centre half – a berth she has been occupying in the national team for the past five years from the time she left school and started playing for Sri Lanka Navy. She is good in both attack and defence. When in the sail she sails into the opponents defence and often tears them into shreds or feeds the flankers with good ball to do the scoring. When in defence she has good judgement and anticipation and could be a ‘thorn in the flesh’ for the opponents attack. Her brilliant play at last years Seetha Devi Sevens for the Navy team she was adjudged the “Player of the Tournament”. This is her sixth tour of Singapore for various tournaments. At 26 she is a much experienced player. She keeps fit by physical exercises and walking in the village roads. She is essentially a village lass from the village of Danture in the Yatinuwara electorate.
It is great to have reached the highest spot in her favourite game of hockey by captaining the national team. But her fellow villagers may not even know what is hockey except see her walking with the curved stick. Madura Dharmaratne is a wonderful girl and soft spoken.
The Vice Captain of the team is stockily built Jeewanthika Keerthiratne and is the top spot goal keeper of the side. It could be said that it is by a strange quirk of fate that she is playing for the national team occupying this berth as number one in the trade for the last seven years.
She played for the school as a center forward and may be that she just made it to the side. Then one day the school’s regular goal keeper was injured during a match and she was asked to be the ‘stop gap’ custodian of the side. She did such a fine job manning the fortress that the regular goal keeper lost her place in the side. Two years later she found herself playing for the national team as its custodian and she has been holding this berth for the last seven years and is one of the senior members of the national side.
Like Madura, Jeewanthika is also from the village and is from Pilimatalawa and the villagers hardly know hockey. It is through sheer dedication and application that these girls from the adjoining villagers have made it to the national team and are at the helm.
