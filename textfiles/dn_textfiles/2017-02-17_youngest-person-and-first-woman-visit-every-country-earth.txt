Youngest person and first woman to visit EVERY country on Earth

A 27-year-old has become the youngest person and the first woman to visit every country on Earth - after hitting 196 destinations in just 18 months.
Cassie De Pecol’s epic voyage has taken in all 193 sovereign nations plus Taiwan, Kosovo and Palestine since she set off in July 2015.
The globetrotters’s trip cost $198,000 (£158,000) and involved 280 flights.
The intrepid traveller, from Washington, Connecticut, USA, began to plan her adventure - dubbed ‘Expedition 196’ - on the 25th birthday.
She will be listed as a Guinness World Record-holder after the ticking off the last country, Yemen, this month.
But despite taking in incredible sights across the globe, she stressed: “Despite what you may think, this expedition has not been easy”.
Cassie acted as peace ambassador for the International Institute of Peace Through Tourism and Skal International during the her journey.
Her work involved meeting with university tourism students to discuss responsible tourism and economics.
In addition, she worked with Adventurers and Scientists for Conservation to collect water samples to test for the presence of micro plastics.
After completing the adventure, she wrote on Facebook : “People in real life of all walks of life in every country of every color of every religion and nationality have been so incredibly kind to me.”
Cassie previously said: “Since school, I’ve had this desire to visit every country in the world, intrigued to learn more about every culture, natural habitat, and religion.
“In America we are lucky to have such a vast melting pot of cultures and people from all over the world who make the country what it is today.
“I wanted to learn about where these people came from, more specifically, where I came from, with my ancestors originating from Europe. I wondered what existed outside of North America and what it was like. Is the Middle East really like how they say it is on the news? What about the Amazon? Going to every country was for me a personal quest to learn as much as I could about our world, stepping outside my comfort zone and becoming comfortable in the unknown, while also aiming to leave a legacy behind.”
After 15 months on the road, Cassie has had both highs and lows and believes that travelling as a solo woman has shaped some of her experiences.
She said: “On average, I spend two to five days in each country.
“It’s been amazing meeting with the students and dignitaries, also travelling to off the beaten path locations on my own, places that no one else I know has experienced. I also love long bus rides. Lows are flying, being in airports, and not being in a safe enough environment to go for a run. I’ve been harassed and in sticky situations, whereas a man in the same situation likely wouldn’t have experienced the same.
She added: “Though I haven’t yet become the first documented woman to travel to every country in the world, I imagine that the feeling of accomplishment and awe will be overwhelming. I just hope that I’m able to inspire young women (and men!) around the world to go after goals and feats that so far, people think can only be done by man.”
