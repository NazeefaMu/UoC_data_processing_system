Professionals’ strike ends. Karapitiya Cardiothoracic unit back to normal

Prolonged trade union action launched by a group of consultants of Galle Karapitiya Teaching Hospital ended yesterday following Health Ministry mediation, Director General of the ministry Dr. Palitha Mahipala told media.
This was following the settlement of the professional dispute among the consultant surgeons of Cardiothoracic Unit subsequent to a review mediation of Health Ministry officials led by Director General of the ministry.
The Director General was addressing the media at a press briefing held at the hospital director’s office yesterday.
Since September 30, a group of consultants launched a strike in protest of an alleged misuse of surgical operation theaters and supplementary facilities by a cardiothoracic consultant attached to the unit denying the other consultant surgeons of equal opportunities in utilizing them.
However, as the dispute among the medical professionals continued causing immense hardship for the public, Health Ministry Director General Dr. Palitha Maheepala yesterday paid an official visit at which he had discussions with all parties concerned to reach an agreeable solution.
“I together with a group of officials of the ministry discussed with the respective consultant cardiologists of the hospital who were in a dispute over equal opportunities of the use of operating theatres, Surgical Intensive Care Units, wards and other related medical and surgical facilities of the Cardiothoracic unit. We could arrive at an agreeable decision justifiable to all. Hence the strike action was ended with effect from today and functions of all sections of the unit recommenced as usual,” Dr. Palitha Maheepala said.
As disclosed by the Health Director General, Consultant Surgeon Namal Gamage will be allowed to utilize 50 percent of the theatre and other surgery facilities at the Cardiothoracic Unit of KTH while the remaining 50 percent of theatre amenities will be equally shared between other two Cardiologists Trolusha Harischandra and Dhammika Rassnayake respectively.
Accordingly the existing operation theatres of the unit, on two days and all morning sessions of the week will be assigned to Consultant Namal Gamage to carry out his cardiothoracic surgeries while on all other days the theaters and related facilities will be allocated for the other two consultants.
“Karapitiya Hospital is much popular among people for cardiac and thoracic operations.We have observed that there is an urgent need of expansion in cardiothoracic unit. The ministry has planned to establish a new cardiothoracic unit with modern facilities and equipment at the Karapitiya Teaching Hospital,” Dr. Palitha Maheepala said.
“The ministry is constantly making maximum effort and contribution for the uplift of the health and medical services of the country. In 2015 the National Budget allocated Rs. 192 billion for the health ministry. It is only 1.8 percent of the GDP. It is envisaged that during the 2016 budget the health allocation will be increased up to 3 percent. So next year we will have a colossal monetary allocation for our development projects,” Dr. Maheepala said.
