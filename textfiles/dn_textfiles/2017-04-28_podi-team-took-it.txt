Podi Team took it!

720 participants in 240 tuk-tuks set out at the dead of night from the start point of Thalduwa Kelani Valley Sports Ground recently to cover two provinces, 20 cities, 190 kilometres and 15 challenges in a bid to reach Nuwara Eliya and achieved glory as the winners of Red Bull Tuk It 2017. The rally, which lasted 21 hours, tested all teams equally as they battled fatigue, emotions, challenges and most of all the terrain of Sri Lanka which proved it is one to be reckoned with.
From the first stage on wards, Podi Team from the Sabaragamuwa Province took on a more strategic and calculated path through the rally, as they remained calm and followed route instructions allowing them to gain the most points. Completing 90 percent of the tasks set through the rally, Podi Team pulled to the top of the pack, and from the final checkpoint at the Ambewela New Zealand Farm to NuwaraEliya saw them pick up pace as they saw their end line.
Podi Team emerged as the winner. Team Eksath Threerodha Ratha Sangamaya came bagged teh second place whilst Team Ambalangoda was relegated to 3rd place. Last but not least, Team Pink Lions from Maharagama was awarded the prize of being the most creative tuk-tuk.
