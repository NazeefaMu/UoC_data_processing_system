H’tota port deal with transparency soon - Minister

Newly appointed Ports and Shipping Minister Mahinda Samarasinghe says he has taken over negotiations pertaining to Hambantota port development deal with China Merchants to his hand.
The minister expressed hope that both parties will come to a consensus which would ultimately create a win-win situation for the both parties. “Earlier so many parties were involved in negotiating the deal on behalf of the government, while several contrary cabinet papers were presented to the parliament. This sent a very wrong signal to the international community.”
He made these comments speaking at the Chartered Institute of Logistics and Transport Leaders evening 2017 held in Colombo. According to the minister, he has already consulted his colleagues including Ministers Malik Samarawickrama, Arjuna Ranathunga and Sarath Amunugama, who have been involved in this process previously.
“We are working as a team, but I have taken negotiations to my hand,” he said.
Samarasinghe expressed hope that Sri Lanka would be able to put in place an eventual agreement that will not compromise the national interest of the country.
“We have had several rounds of discussions with China Merchant Port. Ports Authority Chairman Dissanayake also had several discussions. He has spent hours and hours in discussing the nitty-gritty’s of the agreement. Security aspects will not be comprised in any way, meaning that the navy will discharge their mandate and the ports authority will discharge their mandate .The Sri Lanka Ports Authority Act will not be amended to suit the particular situation.
The draft will be shared with the President and the Prime Minister. The President has already outlined his concerns. Once it is approved by the ministers in parliament, it will be signed. There will be transparency. It is facing a lot of controversy, so I want to place the agreement before the parliament, so it becomes a public document.
The public will see what’s in the agreement; nothing should be hidden,” the minister said.
SL Ports Authority burdened with servicing H’tota port loans
Minister Samarasinghe also claimed that Sri Lanka Ports Authority had to spend its own generated funds amounting to US $ 175 million in servicing loans, obtained to build the Hambantota port.
“Serving of loans has been entirely shouldered by SLPA, not the treasury.”
If this strategic partnership is put into place, the minister hopes that all that money will be saved and could be used for the development of Jaya Terminal, as well as the East Terminal depending on the load factor.
SLPA is also seriously looking to develop the West Terminal, however, according to the minister that decision will have to be taken in the context of load factor.
