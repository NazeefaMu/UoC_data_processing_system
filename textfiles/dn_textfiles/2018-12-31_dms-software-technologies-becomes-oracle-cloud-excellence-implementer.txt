DMS Software Technologies becomes Oracle Cloud Excellence Implementer

DMS Software Technologies, a leading and pioneering IT Solutions Company in the Asia Pacific region and a long-standing partner of Oracle, has been accredited as Sri Lanka’s first-ever Oracle Cloud Excellence Implementer (CEI).
The Oracle Cloud Excellence Implementer (CEI) Program helps align Oracle’s partner ecosystem with customer success by leveraging Oracle Software as a Service (SaaS) products.
This program helps identify, recognize, and differentiate highly-qualified consulting firms from across the globe that demonstrate ongoing expertise, successful track records, and superior customer satisfaction in Oracle Cloud implementations by specified geography and cloud service module.
The CEI Program provides a clear and objective view of partner qualifications for implementing Oracle SaaS solutions, and helps prospective customers of these partners to identify firms that have the necessary resources, training and proven track record for the required scope and geography of a project.
In order to be accepted into the CEI Program consulting firms must meet the requirement to attain Oracle Cloud Excellence Implementer status for a specific cloud service module within a defined geography. Once a firm has been accepted into the CEI Program, they must ensure that they continue to meet a set of ongoing engagement skills and implementation success criteria to retain their CEI status.
Lasantha Bogoda, General Manager of DMS Software Technologies said, “Achieving the Oracle Cloud Excellence Implementer status is definitely a significant milestone for DMS. We have successfully raised the bar and yet again set the benchmark in the local ICT industry. As an Oracle Cloud Excellence Implementer we can help our customers minimize implementation risk, adopt new cloud functionality, and realize the full business value of Oracle Cloud.”
Uditha Jayaratne, Head of Enterprise Applications of DMS Software Technologies said, “Our large pool of talented consultants have continued to demonstrate the ability in delivering highly successful implementations accelerated through the use of proven and clearly-defined methodologies. DMS and Oracle have developed the perfect synergy in identifying and strongly understanding the business goals of our customers not only from a technology perspective but with a focus on the business-led transformation enabled by that technology.”
He added that the rapid growth and development of Oracle Cloud Solutions demands the DMS consultants to be fully-geared and updated with latest in-depth knowledge of the Cloud services and the modern global best practices.
“Our proven project management together with our collaboration with our customers in change management has resulted in delivering and exceeding expected business outcomes at the pace customers demand,” he added.
