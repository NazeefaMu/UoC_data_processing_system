IGP submits report to Police Commission

Inspector General of Police (IGP) Pujith Jayasundara submitted a report to the National Police Commission (NPC) yesterday on the incident involving use of force against a group of university students who stormed the health ministry premises recently during an anti-SAITM protest.
The NPC had called for a report from the IGP about the manner in which Police dealt with the anti-SAITM protestors who entered the Health Ministry by force and caused damages to the property.
NPC sources said the report will be taken up for discussions by the Commission members on Thursday.
The Inter University Student Federation (IUSF), protesting against the South Asian Institute of Technology and Medicine (SAITM), forcefully entered the Ministry on June 21 and kept it under their control until a Special Task Force team removed the students.
Around 90 students were injured and hospitalised in the incident.
