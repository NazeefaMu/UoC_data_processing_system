Iconic  dishes reimagined

It’s no secret plenty of shoppers go to IKEA just to eat the meatballs - but the furniture giant has announced some more bizarre cafeteria creations.
The Dogless Hotdog, a creation made with dried baby carrots and a bun made of micro-algae, The Bug Burger - a burger made from mealworms and the Neatball, also made from mealworms are a few of the new items added to the menu.
The company announced a secret lab in Copenhagen known as Space10 which develops new dishes.
The Dogless Hotdog, The Bug Burger, The Neatball - both a variety made from mealworms and another from vegetables, the LOKAL salad made from microgreens and Microgreen ice cream are the dishes they tried.
The lab posted an update on blogging site Medium saying they’d re-imagined five dishes.
They wrote: “At SPACE10, our research is rooted in an important principle. Dishes shouldn’t just be healthy or sustainable. They must be delicious, too.
To change people’s minds about food, to inspire them to try new ingredients, we can’t just appeal to the intellect - we have to titillate their taste buds.
Which is why we’ve been working with our chef-in-residence to come up with dishes that look good, taste good, and are good for people and planet.
It’s time, then, to put some of those dishes on the menu - starting with a playful take on our favourite fast-food.”
They added to the post the dishes were fresh from the test kitchen, so to not expect them on IKEA’s menu any time soon. Mirror
