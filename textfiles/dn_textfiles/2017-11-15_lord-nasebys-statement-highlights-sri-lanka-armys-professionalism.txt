'Lord Naseby's statement highlights Sri Lanka Army's professionalism'

Information unearthed by Lord Naseby highlights the professional conduct of the Sri Lankan Army during the period of the war, said Foreign Affairs State Minister Wasantha Senanayake.
He reiterated the Government’s deep appreciation for Lord Naseby for his continuous and long standing support extended to Sri Lanka.
He made these observations, replying to an adjournment motion moved by the Joint Opposition in Parliament yesterday.
“Lord Naseby’s statement helped us remove the dark shadow cast on the Sri Lankan Armed Forces for many years since the war ended. This is an achievement for the entire country. I request all MPs in both the Government and Opposition, to individually write to Lord Naseby to thank him. This is a great opportunity for Sri Lanka to negate the wrong impression on our armed forces and we must use it to the fullest,” he said.
Replying to MP Gunawardena, Senanayake distanced the Foreign Ministry from the comments Deputy Minister Dr Harsha de Silva said to have been made. “The Foreign Ministry recognizes the value of Lord Naseby’s statement. I would be surprised if Dr Harsha de Silva had actually made such a statement, but I do not know whether he actually said it or not,” said Senanayake.
“It was due to short sighted policies that took Sri Lanka to an isolated position in the world. I cannot perceive a threat to this country either with regard to defence forces or its present or former leaders in the light of the excellent relationship Sri Lanka now enjoys with the international community. Certainly, the information unearthed by Lord Naseby must be used by the Government and Opposition parties and all those who consider themselves friends of Sri Lanka to counter the blatant falsehoods that were spread about the country and the war,” he added.
The State Minister also read out a letter he sent to Lord Naseby on behalf of the Government, admiring his efforts on behalf of Sri Lanka.
“In the letter I thanked Lord Naseby for his invaluable work and said that the information made public by Lord Naseby makes it clear that the Sri Lanka armed forces fought a much cleaner war than is often alleged in the international arena,” he noted.
