Wesley beat Royal, Thurstan triumph in both age groups

Wesley recorded a thumping-win over Royal-Colombo in their U17 D1 match concluded on Monday at their home ground. Wesley bowlers, Mohommad Ubaidulla, Sakuntha Liyanage and Janith Sandakalum picking up eight wickets for just 61 runs among them set the tone for Wesley’s early dominance as Royal batting first managed only 128 before Wesley batsmen led by Thisuraka Akmeemana and Hasith Perera contributing 79 runs between the two reached the target in less than 39 overs to win the match easily by 6 wickets.
Meanwhile, Thurstan won both matches they played when they beat Ananda MV, Kottawa and Nalanda College (B) on first innings in their U15 D11 and U17 D11 tournament matches respectively. In these two matches, Shanilka Udayashantha who took 7 for 30 against Nalanda and Suran Perera scored an unbeaten century against Ananada, Kottawa became the match winners for Thurstan.
In another match of U15 D1 Tournament, St.Anthony’s, Wattala surged to a tremendous win beating Sri Sumangala, Panadura on first innings after they successfully chased down an over-200 target losing just four wickets in the process.
Tharindu Chandima’s unbeaten 114 were instrumental in Wattala, Anthonians success in this match.
Dharmaraja batting through the entire 65 overs allocated to the team batting first according to the new format of U15 Tournament for the second time in two days had to be satisfied with no-result points as their bowlers did not have sufficient number of overs to bowl out St. Mary’s, Kegalle who were reeling at 78 for six when match came to a close.
On Sunday too Dharmaraja were missed out on a definite first-innings win against Anuradhapura Central because of this particular reason.
