They were all created using the Toni&Guy future foundation techniques which is the basic of all their hairdressers’ education.
“We worked on eight models, guys and girls, to showcase the diversity of what all Toni&Guy hairdressers. I had a wonderful experience in Sri Lanka and hope to return soon,” Matuska said.
Toni&Guy had humble beginnings back in 1963 when CEO, OBE and co-founder Toni Mascolo and his brother Guy started with a single salon in Clapham, south London. Today it is an international hair dressing brand with phenomenal success.

Education, teamwork and talent would be the main contributor to the success of the company. From the beginning staffers are nurtured. Toni&Guy supports and encourages them to be the best they can possibly be and inspires them. With strong skills, a genuine love for hair and a deep belief in staying true to their customers are the driving forces behind their success. Education is combined with enjoyment results is faithfulness and gratitude to the company.
“Hairdressing is a thriving industry because no matter what the market or economical situation is; people always want to look their best. Hair is the ultimate statement one can make about him or her, so as long as people have hair there will always be room for the hairdressing industry,” Matuska said.
For Matuska hair dressing as a profession was a natural consequence. He loves people and he loves life. Nothing gives him greater satisfaction than seeing a happy customer. He is also very creative. He is confident and loves to see other people being confident. Hair has always satisfied Matuska, ever since he was a boy.
“Hair Dressing is one of the oldest professions in the world because people want to look good at any age. Call it vanity or pride but hair dressing is here to stay. Hair is not going to go away. It is part of our personality. People like to be bold and people like to be different. Hairdressing is an ever evolving industry. There is a constant flow of new and different technologies. Plus hair by itself is ever changing, allowing for creative innovative techniques and technologies to evolve in synergy with trends and client needs. So it will always be an industry at the forefront of innovation with a bright future for creativity. We aim to provide our young and new trainees with all the skills they would need to become a well-rounded and knowledgeable hairdresser,” stated Matsuka.
Ultimately contentment and happiness are important in any job. If you do what you love doing, you will do well and succeed. It is as simple as that. Matuska gets satisfaction when he imparts knowledge. He gets satisfied when he sees growth and he gets satisfied when he sees others being as passionate as him. He just loves to see people enjoying hair.
“It gives a great satisfaction to work on the many different creative shows, shoots and collection projects. My life can be a little hectic and yes, sometimes stressful but the positives I get from it far outweigh any stress,” Matuska added.
“In this industry you meet good looking people actually fabulous looking people. You see them all over the world. Everywhere you go in this world you meet people who look really fantastic. Working with an international team with flavours from around the world is the best thing I could ever ask to do.
Each person has their own special quality to bring to the table, which is highly rewarding to work with. For me beauty is just the surface of what we do. People are still people whether they are beautiful or not. It's the personal and emotional side that I love. Every place I visit, I feel when I leave, I have made new friends and great members of the international Toni&Guy family,” he said. He added that the director of Toni&Guy Sri Lanka, Gaya, is dedicated in providing only the best in terms of training her staff and a top quality service for her clientele. “She truly wants to put Toni&Guy Sri Lanka on the map and it definitely deserves to be,” he said.
