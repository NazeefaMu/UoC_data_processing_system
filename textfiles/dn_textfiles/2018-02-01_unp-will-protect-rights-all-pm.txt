UNP will protect the  rights of all- PM

The UNP is committed to fostering harmony among all communities and building a society where the rights of all communities are secured, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said.
He made this remark at an election rally in Manner yesterday.
“When we assumed office in January 2015, there was discord among people. We were able to strengthen the reconciliation process by uniting the Sinhala, Tamil, Muslim and all other communities,” the Prime Minister said.
“We have created an environment where all communities can live freely. We are further committed to protecting the Sri Lankan identity,” the Prime Minister commented adding that the UNP could bring about this change as it is includes Party Leaders representing all religions and ethnic groups.
The Prime Minister addressed two more election rallies in Batticaloa and Pottuvil yesterday.
