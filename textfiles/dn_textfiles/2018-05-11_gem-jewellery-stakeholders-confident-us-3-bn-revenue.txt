Gem, Jewellery stakeholders confident  of US$ 3 bn revenue

The gem and jewellery industry stakeholders said that they were confident that they can turnaround the industry to a US$ 3 billion revenue generator in three years time, said Chairman, Lanka Gem Dealers and Miners Association, Ratnapura Punsiri Tennakoon.
Export revenue from the industry last year was US$ 270 million.
Tennakoon said that the industry was faced with a major issue as they were harassed by the Gem and Jewellery Authority (NGJA).
“We met President Maithripala Sirisena who is also the minister in charge of the sector and he has now removed both the Chairman and the Director General of the Gem and Jewellery Authority and we are thankful to him for taking this move.”
He said during the former NGJA Chairman’s time a Rs. 25, 000 tax was imposed on each consignment of gems weighing 100 karats and today they have managed to bring it down to 0.5% of the value.
In addition the former Chairman also stopped the sponsorship of Rs. 10 million from the NGJA given for the FACTS exhibition and we are confident that the new Chairman Peshala Jayaratne will offer it again. This amount is collected from the industry CESS fund which totals up to around Rs. 150 million each year.
Also the gem dealer licence from Rs. 35, 000 was increased to nearly Rs. 300, 000 and there were so many other issues which resulted in a drop in revenue. This has been corrected. He also said that they were also forced take a certificate from the Gem Authority for each export and this was also practically difficult. These issues have now been ironed out thanks to the Presidents intervention, said Secretary Sri Lanka Gem and Jewellery Association, Sherif Rahumn.
The Gem and Jewellery industry had a tax exemption on direct exports and foreign currency sales since 1979. “We are requesting for this exemption once again and the removal of red tape to move the industry to the next level.”
“Due to negative tax effects supplies from overseas are falling significantly and our exporters find it difficult to secure necessary supplies to do their businesses,” he said. (SS)
