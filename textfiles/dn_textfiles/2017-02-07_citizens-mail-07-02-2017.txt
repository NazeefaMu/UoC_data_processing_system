Appeal to USA to save Bangladesh children
I recently read a news from the Daily News that a Bangladeshi father has sought permission from the Government to kill three terminally ill children of his family which melted my heart being unable to treat them anymore. He pleaded mercy killing of his three children from the Government of Bangladesh which really would be a heart rendering predicament for parents nevertheless who belong to any country or community or cast or creed.
This Bengali parent, Hossain, a fruit vendor has described his years of long struggle to cope with the cost of the treatment of a deadly disease called ‘Duchhenne Muscular Dystrophy’ which his two sons aged 24, 13 and a grandson 8, suffer.
Bangladesh is the poorest country in Asia which lacks free health care and medical treatment for the penury people.
At this pathetic situation of these three children, while congratulating Donald Trump the newly elected president of the USA, I make a very humble appeal to help them to overcome their sufferings and save their lives!
