Law not to be discredited
They say you cannot have the cake and also eat it. Similarly, if we want to maintain the law we must implement it. If we don't implement a law which is in the Statute books won’t we bring the law into disrepute? People may interpret that the law is not a good law and that is why the authorities are not implementing it.
The rational societies have not blindly followed those in religions who want criminals to be shown mercy. Mercy should be shown only to the repentant who regret the crime committed. A non-discriminating sweeping exercise of mercy and forgiving criminals will make the criminals who have not regretted their crimes to assume that their crimes were not so blameworthy. Every criminal wants to justify his criminal action.
Such exercise of mercy and waiver of punishment for the crime is undermining the validity of the law against the crime. After all, there is plenty of differences in the nature of crimes and their seriousness as well as on the principle of punishment to fit the crime. Should a murderer be punished by a week’s sentence in jail? Or should punishment fit the crime?
These are issues not debated or discussed in our society. These are issues not for the religious clergy but for practical statesmen involved in governing a country. Their first duty is to maintain law and order and curb serious crimes like murder, kidnapping and child abuse in the society. It is true that capital punishment has not proved a deterrent to serious crime. But it cannot be argued there from that the abolition of capital punishment will not undermine whatever the deterrent effect it has. The foolproof experiments cannot be designed in social matters since it is difficult, if not impossible, to test for a particular cause with a particular effect as required for a sound experiment.
