Wurth Lanka joins hands with A-PAD SL for clean drinking water in Trincomalee

Wurth Lanka, the subsidiary of the German giant in motor vehicle after-market specialist, joined hands with the Asia Pacific Alliance for Disaster Management Sri Lanka (A-PAD SL) to provide clean drinking water to the people of Padavi Sri Pura village in Trincomalee by installing Reverse Osmosis (R/O) filters to ground water sources.
Under this joint initiative, 20 restored R/O filters were installed in four preschools in the area which benefited over 100 children attending these preschools.
“We at Wurth Lanka consider it our duty to support the communities that we live in. It is indeed a privilege to join hands with the Asia Pacific Alliance to provide financial support for this worthy cause. Having access to clean drinking water is a basic human right, and Wurth Lanka will continue to support such endeavors in the future as well,” Rohan Amirthiah-Managing Director, Wurth Lanka (Pvt) Ltd.
The four preschools where the R/O filters have been installed are Aniload Preschool-Seevalipura in Jayanthiwewa, Rantharu Preschool in Sri Thissapura, Hemamali Preschool in Samanpura and Pipena Kekulu Preschool in Sinhapura.
At the official handover ceremony, the Divisional Secretary Padavi Siri Pura V. P. Suneth Dinendrasena thanked Wurth Lanka (Pvt) Ltd and A-PAD SL for undertaking the project to provide safe drinking water to the preschools. Representatives from the community of Padavi Siri Pura too expressed their appreciation to Wurth Lanka and A-PAD SL for giving access to clean drinking water for their children at the preschools.
