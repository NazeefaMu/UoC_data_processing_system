Clairvoyants from the past

Achilles - The cat
As the 2018 FIFA World Cup moves into the next stage, psychic animals have raised their heads to make predictions. Here are some famous four-legged clairvoyants. This famous deaf cat has correctly predicted most results of all the football matches played in Russia till now. He presides at the Hermitage Museum in St. Petersburg, and chooses between bowls of cat food marked with playing countries to ‘predict’ the winner.

Paul - The octopus
Soccer fans’ old friend Paul made a killing in 2008 when most of his predictions for the European Championship as well as the 2010 World Cup came true. After his famous predictions, rumours were rife that he would retire at the Oberhausen Sea Life Centre in Germany. However, in October that year, the famous sea creature passed away in his tank.

Geda - The monkey
This Chinese monkey, apart from predicting winners of multiple World Cup matches in 2010, also predicted Donald Trump’s presidency. He was asked to pick between two bananas placed beside life-sized cut-outs of Trump and Hillary Clinton. After much contemplation, the mystic monkey chose Trump, and even planted a wet kiss on his cardboard likeliness.

Dirty Harry - The crocodile
Harry, a saltwater crocodile living in Australia, correctly predicted that Julia Gillard would become the prime minister in 2010. He also predicted that Spain would win the 2010 World Cup, beating the Netherlands in the finals. Harry’s prediction method involved choosing between two suspended chickens, each of which had photos or flags attached to it.

Nelly - The elephant
This pachyderm from Serengeti National Park has the same abilities as Paul the octopus. The elephant predicted 30 of 33 results correctly for all the FIFA World Cups from 2006 to 2016. She kicks soccer balls into nets marked by national flags of countries she thinks would win. This year, she has predicted that Germany and France will meet in the semi-finals.
