International level academy to be set up for media personnel: Gayantha

Discussions are on to set up an International level academy for media personnel in Sri Lanka, Parliament Reforms and Mass Media Minister Gayantha Karunathilaka said.
According to the minister, the main objective is to bring all media personnel to a certain standard where they can do justice and a better service for the public. Minister Karunathilaka was addressing the media personnel at the Media Ministry Auditorium yesterday after awarding them 60 scholarships. The minister said 145 scholarships were awarded in 2015.
The highest number given to date since the inception of the scholarship awarding programme in 2006. Now journalists are not killed or abducted unlike in the past.
They do not leave the country to save their lives. Sri Lanka had a bad reputation for the media freedom. It ranked 165th place among 180 countries. Now Sri Lanka ranked 143rd. Journalists’ freedom restricts if they stick to the outlet owners' agendas and ideas, the minister said.
Cabinet approval was given to establish a system to regulate the media. People from all walks of life now can submit their ideas and proposals for this. A system to obtain ideas and proposals will be announced soon. Nothing will be done or introduce by force, the minister said.
Parliament Reforms and Mass Media Deputy Minister Karunaratne Paranavithana said journalists were not bribed by giving them scholarships. The programme will be expanded and strengthened and a media awards ceremony will be held soon to recognise their work.
Parliament Reforms and Mass Media Ministry Secretary Nimal Bopage said the scholarships were granted for all eligible applicants. This was the first time such a procedure was followed. An independent committee had selected the applicants and over 95 percent of applicants received scholarships. One scholarships is worth 100,000 rupees.
