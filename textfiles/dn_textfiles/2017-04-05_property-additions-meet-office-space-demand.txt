Property additions to meet office space demand

Sri Lanka’s Research Intelligence Unit (RIU), a real-estate advisory firm said the island's commercial property market in the next three years will see further significant additions to the inventory at the top end of the market.
Releasing its high end commercial property market report for the first quarter of 2017, it said the Colombo City Centre, Shangri-La and Water Front projects will make contributions.
These mixed development projects will be positioned as commercial destinations which offer premier, state of the art A Grade office spaces integrated with residential, retail and luxury hotels.
“With occupancy levels at the top commercial developments maintaining close to 100 percent over several years now, we can observe that there is still unmet demand for high-end commercial space in Colombo,” Research Intelligence Unit chief executive officer Roshan Madawela said. “Over the next several years, we expect supply to narrow the gap with demand which will continue to grow in correlation with economic growth.”
Whilst there are no formal classification systems for commercial office space, several factors can be identified to determine high-end or Grade A office real estate. These factors include the age of the building, location, standard of maintenance, prestige related factors and the availability of parking. In addition, these buildings will have high-quality furnishings, state-of-the-art facilities and excellent accessibility.
This high-end segment of the market is often targeted towards the international market, demanding rents that are well above prevailing averages. In the Sri Lankan context, WTC, HNB Towers, Access and PARKLAND are considered as meeting the mark in all respects of Grade A commercial property. The latter, as the latest development on the market, is the subject of a detailed case study in the RIU report.
Parkland by RIL property is the latest Grade A office space supplier to start operations in Colombo is a real estate company founded in 2009, as an owner, developer and manager of Grade ‘A’ commercial office space in Colombo.
