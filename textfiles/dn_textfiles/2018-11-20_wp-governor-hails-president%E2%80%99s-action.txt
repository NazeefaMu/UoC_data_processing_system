WP Governor hails President’s action

Western Province Governor Hemakumara Nanayakkara hailed President Maithripala Sirisena for his timely action to prevent the collapse of Parliamentary democracy.
Nanayakkara was speaking at a special press conference held at the Western Province Governors Office yesterday. He further said Sri Lnaka does not interefere with the internal affairs of other countries. Therefore,the Government of Sri Lanka expects other countries to refrain from interefering with the domestic affairs of our country.
The Western Province Governor further emphasised that the authority for appointing the Prime Minister is the sole right of the President. Therefore, he further said that with the appointment of a new Prime Minister by the President, the former Prime Minister should hand over all the official and government properties to his successor in an legal manner.
Western Province Governor Hemakumara Nanayakkara also spoke about the purchase of chairs for the Western Provincial Council while utilising public funds. He said that according to the tender approved, the cost for the 150 chairs would have been colossal.
The Western Province Governor further said that fortunately, a huge amount of public funds was saved by the cancellation of the particular Tender.
