The Sri Lanka Institute of Information and Technology (SLIIT), Sri Lanka’s leading higher education institution, recently signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU), with the Computer Society of Sri Lanka (CSSL) confirming their sponsorship of the National IT Conference (NITC) 2017 organised by the computer society of Sri Lanka as a Gold Sponsor.
The MoU signing ceremony was held at the Computer Society of Sri Lanka and graced by top officials of both organisations including CSSL President Yasas Abeywickrama and SLIIT Director Development and Engineering Uditha Gamage.
Since its inception in 1999, SLIIT has successfully established an environment that is conducive to learning throughout all its campuses and centres, producing 60 PhD holders and over 10,000 success stories. The institute has two campuses in Malabe and Colombo and also four regional centres in Matara, Kandy, Kurunegala and Jaffna. It is also the first Sri Lankan institute to be accredited by the Institution of Engineering and Technology UK, for Information Technology degrees, with degrees approved by the University Grants Commission under the Universities Act.
Additionally, the institute is a member of the Association of Commonwealth Universities and International Association of Universities (IAU). Offering a wide range of study areas including Bachelor’s, Master’s and PhD degrees in Computing, Business, Engineering, Architecture and Quantity Surveying, SLIIT also connects people both locally and globally.CSSL is the premier professional association for individuals and organisations leading the ICT industry in Sri Lanka. It is a rallying point for ICT professionals throughout the country and espouses the shared vision of over 50,000 individuals ranging from ICT practitioners, academics and policy makers to other professionals in diverse fields and members of the business community. Today, the CSSL is widely regarded as both the 'voice' of this influential industry segment and a 'key player” in ICT development, nationally.
The NITC organised annually by the CSSL, is the flagship Information Communication Technology (ICT) conference held in Sri Lanka since 1982, involving ICT professionals, academia, technology experts, policy makers, entrepreneurs and private and public sector key decision makers both locally and internationally.
NITC, to be hels later this year, is the only national event which brings together the largest number of ICT professionals in Sri Lanka. This year marks the 35th anniversary of NITC which will be run in partnership with the South East Asian Regional Computer Confederation (SEARCC) Conference as well as the General Assembly of International Federation for Information Processing (IFIP) and thus it is anticipated to be one of the most important global ICT events in 2017 and also Sri Lanka’s biggest-ever international ICT event.
