FR filed against PM’s remarks over Sinharasa case dismissed

The Supreme Court yesterday refused to grant leave to proceed with the Fundamental Rights petition filed by a lawyer seeking Interim Relief with a direction to Speaker Karu Jayasuriya to suspend any further action on the request made by Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe, urging a ruling from the Speaker on the constitutionality of a Supreme Court Judgement popularly known as the Sinharasa case.While refusing to grant leave to proceed with the case,a three-judge-Bench comprising Justice Priyasath Dep,Justice Upaly Abeyratne and Justice Anil Goonaratne upheld the preliminary objections raised by Attorney General that the Court should not interfere with the affairs of Parliament in accordance with the section 3 of the Parliament (Powers and Privileges) Act.
The petitioner Nagananda Kodituwakku, an Attorney-at-Law by profession filed this petition naming Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe, President Maithripala Sirisena through the Attorney General and Speaker Karu Jayasuriya as respondents.
When the petition came up before Supreme Court, President’s Counsel K.Kanageswaran appearing for the Prime Minister raised preliminary objections regarding the petition citing that the Supreme Court has no jurisdiction to intervene into the affairs of Parliament.
The Petitioner stated that on the July 7,2016, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe, requested a Ruling from the Speaker on the constitutionality of the Supreme Court Judgment (SC/SPL/LA/182/99) - popularly known as the Singrasa case on the basis that the jurisdiction for constitutional competence of the President to acceded to the optional protocol of the ICCPR is with Parliament and not with the Supreme Court.
The Petitioner stated in this backdrop the statement of the Prime Minister and the action proposed by him, becomes a direct violation of the inalienable sovereign rights of the people, enshrined in Article 3 of the Constitution. The petitioner further said failing to prevent the course of action demanded by the Prime Minister, it shall be a breach of petitioner’s Fundamental Rights and rights of the other citizenry of the Republic guaranteed by the said Article 12(1).
The Supreme Court in the Singarasa case agreed that the government of Sri Lanka had set out the correct legal position which stated its responsibility to the Human Rights Commission (HRC) as follow.
“The constitution of Sri Lanka and the prevailing legal regime do not provide for release or retrial of a convicted person after his conviction is confirmed by the higher appellate Court. Therefore the state does not have the legal authority to execute the decisions of the HRC to release the convict or grant a retrial. The government of Sri Lanka cannot be expected to act in any manner which is contrary to the constitution.
Deputy Solicitor General Viraj Dayaratne appeared for the Attorney General.
