Aava no threat to national security: Army Commander

Army Commander Lt. General Mahesh Senanayake said there was no threat to national security from the so-called Aava Group.
He said the security forces were equipped to deal with any type of a danger to national security. Lt. General Senanayake expressed these views at a press conference held at the Mechanical and Engineering Corps Headquarters in Slave Island.
The Commander said the military apparatus was powerful and the intelligence network was fully active. Hence, there was no possibility of any threat from Aava or any other group to arise.
The Army Commander said false reports on social media about the distribution of lands to the people in North, had given the wrong impression to the public.
He added that although the Army had occupied some lands in North; those were previously owned by the people there. Therefore, the Army will take action in future to distribute lands to its previous owners as a symbol of friendship and co-existence.
