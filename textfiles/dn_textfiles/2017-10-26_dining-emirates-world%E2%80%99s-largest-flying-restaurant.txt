Dining on Emirates - the world’s largest flying restaurant

Emirates serves more than 100 million meals a year with the same attention to detail in First, Business and Economy Class. Catering for more than 55 million dine-in guests a year travelling to and from 144 cities across six continents, no one understands global culinary trends better than Emirates as it serves destination-inspired cuisine onboard the world’s largest flying restaurant.
With a catering investment of US$1 billion per year, Emirates runs a round-the-clock kitchen with 1,200 chefs based in Dubai whipping up 12,450 recipes. The finely-tuned operation caters 590 flights a day with authentic local cuisines giving customers a taste of the destination they are going to. The airline also works closely with 25 catering partners around the world to provide the same quality of food for its Dubai-bound flights.
Emirates’ focus on local flavour means it has food available from every region it flies to. Passengers on flights to and from Sri Lanka for example, can experience Tamarind chicken curry with moongkiribath and seenisambol, Mysore masala dosa, chicken curry with lemon grass with Sri Lankan roti, Idli Upma, Pol sambol and lunumiris.
Similarly flights to Japan offer authentic Kaiseki cuisine and Bento boxes served with Japanese crockery, cutlery and tea sets to ensure an unrivalled food experience on board.
The airline recently launched a new menu for its Australian routes inspired by the breadth of the country’s multicultural flavours and cuisines, after a 14-month process working in consultation with local chefs. The new menu features a broad range of traditional local favourites such as minted lamb sausages. Reflecting Australia’s multiculturalism, the menu also includes Asian flavours, as well as Middle Eastern flavours and ingredients, catering to Emirates’ diverse passenger mix and representing its global route network.
To keep up with regional and seasonal food trends, Emirates changes its onboard menus monthly and continually reviews its recipes. In premium classes, meals are served on Royal Doulton tableware with Robert Welch cutlery specially designed for Emirates. Emirates also offers child-friendly meals for its youngest customers and dedicated menus for medical or religious meal requirements which are designed with a team of nutritionists and chefs. The airline also develops seasonal menus where possible, such as a Christmas menu in December and specially created boxes for those fasting during the holy month of Ramadan.
