Those obstructing govt’s progress have left - Navin

Minister of Plantation Industries Navin Dissanayake said that the people who were plotting against the government have already left and the UNP has strengthened itself to provide a better service to the people.
He said that he was thankful to those who moved out of the government.
Participating at a New Year celebration in Hanguranketha, Minister Dissanayake said that the people who were obstructing the progress of the government are no more and therefore they can march forward peacefully.
“I sent an SMS to a minister who opposed the Prime Minister to leave the government if they do not like it; they need not remain with the government criticising the Prime Minister and the government. And finally they resigned from their portfolios,” he said. The minister said that he was able to gain more support when the secret ballot was called to set up the UNP politburo and added that it was possible due to the prevailing strong democracy within the party.
“I am the only Sinhalese minister in the cabinet representing the Nuwara Eliya district; therefore I have a huge responsibility. And I have also been able to be part of the UNP politburo. The UNP is the only party that called for four secret ballots to set up the politburo. That was possible only because of the internal democracy within the party,” he said.
He further said that UNP had a secret ballot two weeks before as well and it was he who got the majority support of the party.
Minister Dissanayake added that the votes showed the stance of the UNP MPs in the party. “I have a great responsibility and I will take every necessary initiative to strengthen the party,” he said.
The minister further said that people taught them a good lesson during the local government elections and the government has 18 months to deliver better service to the public.
He said that considering the response of the public, the government has taken initiatives to make appropriate changes.
“We are discussing how to reform the party. In the coming six months people could expect many changes to happen. The government has allocated Rs. 50 billion for the betterment of the public and several subsidies will be granted for them,” he said.
