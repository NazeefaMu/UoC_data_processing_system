Assist Sri Lanka’s ordinary public more: Chinese Ambassador

Other foreign countries could focus on providing assistance more for the Sri Lankan ordinary public instead of using the opportunity as a tool to interfere in Sri Lanka's internal affairs, Chinese Ambassador Xi Xianliang said.
He was speaking to the gathering after donating Rs. 13 million to Sri Lanka Cancer Care Trust Chairman Dr. Samadhi Rajapaksa to assist the Trust to help cancer patients throughout the Island.
The ceremony held at the Cancer Care Association of Sri Lanka on September 22 was attended by Speaker Karu Jayasuriya. Ambassador Yi said China was one of the largest donation providers to Sri Lanka and health area was the key field. It accounts for one-third of the donation every year, he said.
The Chinese assistance is inclusive and mainly focuses on the people's livelihood. Speaker Karu Jayasuriya expressed his gratitude and said it was a donation given to the Sri Lanka People, reflecting the profound friendship of the Chinese people.
