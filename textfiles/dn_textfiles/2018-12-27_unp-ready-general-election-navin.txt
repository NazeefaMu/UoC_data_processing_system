UNP ready for General Election - Navin

The United National Party is preparing for a General Election, which is to be held after April next year, Party’s National Organiser Minister Navin Dissanayake said.
He said that he had informed party leader Ranil Wickremesinghe and the Board of Leaders that the party should be organised for that election.
Minister Dissanayake was speaking at the Maharagama Apeksha Hospital premises on Tuesday.
He said although the SLFP backed out, the Unity Government still exists as its other constituent party, the Sri Lanka Muslim Congress is supporting the government.
When asked, Minister Dissanayake said the UNP has to have the support of the SLFP MPs in case the TNA did not support to have the 113 majority in the House.
He said therefore, the SLFP MPs who are willing to work with the UNP can take the party membership and join the UNP to go forward with the new government.
In response to the President Sirisena’s statement that the SLFP MPs crossing over to the UNP would not be given ministerial portfolios, Minister Dissanayake said that they had informed the party’s opinion in this regard to the President.
