French connections

Every year in March the world celebrates the ‘mois de la Francophonie’ (Francophone culture month). The expression ‘Francophonie’ refers to the global community of French-speaking people who promote special ties among all of France’s colonial ambitions with other nations in its history. It represents one of the biggest linguistic zones in the world with more than 274 million people speaking French. Its members don’t share only language, but also humanist values.
A series of cultural, educational and scientific events which aim to promote francophone cultures will be held across the world throughout the month. These events are held to celebrate the cultural creativity and diversity of the francophone countries.
Over the past few years ‘Bonjour Cinema!’, the Francophone Film Festival in Sri Lanka, has become an increasingly popular event among local movie buffs. Every year, the festival attracts large audiences. This year, Bonjour Cinema! 2017 will be held from March 15 to 19 at the BMICH cinema hall, Colombo, and on March 18 and 19 at the Queens Hotel, Kandy. It is organized by the Embassy of France, the Embassy of Switzerland, the Embassy of Vietnam, Wallonie-Bruxelles international represented by the Consulte of Belgium, the Canadian High Commission, the Consulte of Tunisia and the Alliance Francaise de Kotte in association with the Bandaranaike center for International Studies (BCIS) and agenda 14. This year marks the 12th edition of the event which brings the latest and diversified movies produced in member countries of the International Organisation of ‘La Francophonie’ (OIF) into the limelight.
Bonjour Cinema! 2017 will be held under the patronage of the internationally acclaimed actress Swarna Mallawarachchi who recently won a Lifetime Achievement Award at the 23rd Vesoul International Film Festival (VIFF) of Asian Cinema in France. She has also won the Best Actress Award 26 times and has been a UNHCR Ambassador for Women’s Rights.
Speaking at the event held to brief the media about Bonjour Cinema! 2017 the French Ambassador to Sri Lanka and the Maldives Jean Marin Schuh noted that cinema is a powerful medium which builds up a platform of expression, and encourages creation.
“Bonjour Cinema! was initiated in 2005 and is now deeply rooted in the cultural agenda of Colombo. It has grown from strength to strength over the years. This year you can expect more of everything: great movies, places and people, at the event. We have brought down some of the latest award winning high quality movies from France, Switzerland, Vietnam, Belgium, and Tunisia,” he said.
All the films will be presented with English subtitles, enabling the audience to experience different aspects of the Francophone world through cinema. Entrance is free. Aiming at bringing free cultural activities that entertain, educate and improve cross-cultural understanding, to both Sri Lanka and the international community, the festival will also present short films made by Sri Lankan filmmakers before each film.
The festival will open with the French film ‘La French’ on March 15. This event is only for invitees.

Love Songs (Les chansons d’amour)

Genre: Musical, drama, romance, 1h 40m
Director: Christophe Honoré
Stars: Louis Garrel, Ludivine Sagnier, Chiara Mastroianni
This is the opening Film of Bonjour Cinema in Kandy. Love Songs (French: Les Chansons d’amour) is a 2007 French musical film directed by Christophe Honoré, starring Louis Garrel, Ludivine Sagnier, Clotilde Hesme and Chiara Mastroianni. It was one of the 20 films selected for the main competition at the 2007 Cannes Film Festival.
It’s a contemporary (timeless?) film about human relationships. The humor in this film is typically French. The music is also a key element in the film and gives it a Parisian melancholical aura. The music is often used by two or more characters in the form of a dialog where they show their feelings and points of view. As they sing, the scenes are incredible well filmed either outdoor, in the endless avenues of Paris, or indoor in the cosiness of a warm bed in a cold winter night.
9 month stretch (9 mois ferme)
March 18 at BMICH Cinema Hall at 3 pm
Genre: Comedy, 1h, 22m
Director: Albert Dupontel
Stars: Sandrine Kiberlain, Albert Dupontel, Nicolas Marié
9 Month Stretch (French: 9 mois ferme) is a 2013 French comedy film written, directed by and starring Albert Dupontel. It was nominated for six categories at the 39th César Awards including Best Film and Best Director and Best Actor for Dupontel, winning Best Actress for its co-star Sandrine Kiberlain and Best Original Screenplay.
Albert Dupontel in Odette Toulemonde is more than brilliant. The story, albeit completely unlikely, is funny, silly, smart and just a great movie you can only come out smiling. Both principal actors do a marvelous job and you will not be disappointed. The Artist’s Jean Dujardin makes an appearance as the funniest, nonsensical hearing impaired translator on the local TV news channel. See it and laugh. Enjoy!
