Holds no water

The movie series has had the makings of an epic adventure. Ever since ‘Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl, the first in the series took over the wide screen in 2003, the movies have been much sought after by moviegoers.
The last film in the series swings between two talented actors: Johnny Depp and Javier Bardem. Orlando Bloom too gets noticed in a cameo. The rest of the cast do their bit but are unable to keep the movie afloat.
The VFX is stunning and the actors’ comic timing is impeccable. Cinematographer Paul Cameron’s shots of cramped Caribbean towns and the vast nothingness of sea are impressive. The pace of the film keeps you hooked. The movie also thrives on star-power, cameos and special effects. Directors Joachim Rønning and Espen Sandberg also work up a stormy sea-parting finale.
Troubled waters
However two elements get the movie in troubled waters. The film lacks surprises. You can simply guess what is about to happen and some of the actions seem unbelievable as well. Not only does it this make a boring watch but it is also like a stab in the heart for those who wished to see a fitting farewell to Jack Sparrow.
The other drawback is that Jack Sparrow, the character who led all the action in the previous movies, seems out of place in this storyline. It is truly heartbreaking to see a franchise coming to an end by deeming its protagonist and requiring so little of him in this manner.
Sense of nostalgia
Though Sparrow continues to be a charming, drunken pirate who waddles into a quest for the ultimate treasure in ‘Dead Men Tell No Tales’, he lacks the punch. The bulk of the film focuses on Henry’s quest to find Poseidon’s Trident and free his father, Will Turner, from a curse. He runs into Carina who is also after the Trident as a means to connect with her own estranged father. However the young adventurers need a ship and a captain to take them to the treasure. This is when Sparrow steps in and this seems to be his sole purpose. Meantime Sparrow is also on the run from Salazar, a half-dead-half-alive ghost-man thirsty for revenge.
Despite the odds one still does get a little thrill in watching Johnny Depp play the legendary Jack Sparrow. Though the movies which entered the series later were not quite up to the mark, ‘Pirates of the Caribbean’ fans cannot help but feel a sense of nostalgia in hoping to see more of Depp dressed as Sparrow in the future.
