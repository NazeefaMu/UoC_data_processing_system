Tenant farmers protest

Tenant farmers in the Hambantota district staged a protest over the decision taken by the agrarian services department to give a share of 18 bushels of paddy per acre to paddy field owners, instead of 14 bushels that was given in the past.
The farmers said they are cultivating paddy fields under trying circumstances by obtaining loans.
A representative of the Ridiyagama integrated farmer association said that a tenant farmer has to spend Rs.70,000 to cultivate an acre of paddy and derives only an income of Rs. 21,000 per acre. The representative said this issue will be brought to the notice of the relevant authorities at the district agricultural committee meeting.
