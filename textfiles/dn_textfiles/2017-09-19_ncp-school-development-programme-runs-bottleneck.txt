NCP school development programme runs into bottleneck

The accelerated programme launched by the North Central Provincial Council to develop resources in the provincial education sector was standstill at present.
The programme was launched to construct and renovate classrooms and provide drinking water facilities to 810 schools in the province. Over Rs. 7,200 million was allocated last year for the Provincial Council to carry out the programme.
"We commenced infrastructural work at 503 schools in the province. We paid bills to the value of Rs. 1,620 million through the council funds to the contractors.
Again Rs. 1,007 million has to be paid, and we have not received funds from the Education Ministry as promised. Therefore, we have to abandoned 2,076 development projects at 503 schools and contractors have closed their work sites," NCP Chief Minister and Education Minister Peshala Jayaratne Bandara said. He said he requested the authorities to release the full allocation but they ignored the request. The Chief Minister said he would seek the intervention of the President if the situation continued.
