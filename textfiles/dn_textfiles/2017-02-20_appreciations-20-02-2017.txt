Peter Silva Lokugalappatti
Revered politician
Peter Silva Lokugalappatti was born in Gandara, Matara. His family was UNP supporters. He entered politics in 1969 as he was elected as Gandara Village Committee Chairman.
In 1980, he was elected to the Matara District Development Committee uncontested. He was National Savings Bank Director. He won the by-election in 1983 and was appointed Fisheries Deputy Minister in 1983.
He spoke fluent Tamil and he was popular in the Eastern Province. He was instrumental in establishing a fisheries office in Trincomalee.
He was a popular figure in the Trincomalee District as he was a key figure in providing fishing implements to the fisherman in the district. They were grateful for his support. Lokugalappatti distributed agriculture implements to the farmers of his electorate. He was a simple but an honorable man, who helped anyone in his electorate who sought his help. Lokugalappatti passed away three months ago leaving behind his wife Indrani Galappatti and seven children, two of whom are doctors.
Lokugalappatti and I were elected to Parliament at the same time in 1983. We were seated in Parliament next to each other.

Ex. MP Kamburupitiya
N. B. Amarasinghe
Popular among students
Nawaratne Bandara Amarasinghe who served as the Registrar, University of Kelaniya passed away on January 31, 2013 and this is in appreciation of his irreplaceable service to the university as well as for his social contribution. He was born in Kegalle, Mawanella on November 24, 1940.
After receiving primary education in Galapitamada Maha Vidyalaya, Kegalle, he received secondary education from St. Anne’s College, Kurunegala. Thereafter, he entered the University of Sri Jayewardenepura in 1967 and earned a BA honors degree in Archaeology in 1970. After finishing higher education, he served at the Department of Archaeology Sri Lanka for a short period.
In 1973, he joined as an Assistant Registrar at the University of Kelaniya where he carried out a yeoman service taking up the post of Senior Assistant Registrar and the Registrar post in 1990. After retiring, he was a Council Member of Ruhuna University and later joined the same University as a Visiting Lecturer in Archeology. His field of teaching was Numismatics which is one of the rare and significant areas of study in Archeology. Amarasinghe was a very popular Visiting Lecturer among the students who followed the Numismatics course of Archeology at the University of Kelaniya too.
A quality which he owned was the humanity.
He exhibited an exemplary life as the Registrar of the University of Kelaniya preserving both the administrative and human qualities that many officers and certain laymen in society are lacking.
For his honor, I wish to remind how he supported all four categories in the University, starting with the vice-Chancellor, the teaching and non-teaching staff, particularly the students. He supported others when a person met with problems at his or her personal or professional life. After retirement, he carried out a remarkable service to develop the Welfare Society at St. Jude Lane Dalugama, Kelaniya where he spent a benevolent life, until his demise by introducing a number of social activities.
Loving kindness, charismatic leadership, philanthropy and audaciousness were some of his qualities which everybody in society should stick to.
May he attained Nibbana!

A. R. M. Abdul Cader
Inspiring statesman
The name A.R.M. Abdul Cader, former MP and Minister, one of the well-known philanthropists of our time, should be remembered so that our future generation could draw inspiration from his life and commit themselves to uphold the principle of justice and fair play to create a better society, said former Muslim Affairs Minister and Muslim Progressive Society Secretary General A.H.M. Azwer.
He was addressing the ceremony to commemorate former MP and Minister A.R.M. Abdul Cader, in Gampola recently.
Azwer recalled the names of great philanthropists of the past such N.D.H. Abdul Caffoor, Sir Mohamed Macan Markar, EL Ibrahim Hajiar and Naleem Hajiar of Beruwela, who spent their wealth to establish Arabic madrasas and centres of Islamic learning, and distributed their wealth among the poor, irrespective of community and caste.
“Cader Hajiar ranks equal to such highly honoured leaders of the past. But it was a travesty of justice that, as it happens nowadays, Cader Hajiar fell victim to political vengeance when he was taken into prison remand for the ‘crime’ of distributing rice to the poor and needy from funds obtained from government sources. Political vendetta sees bounds,” Azwe said.
He added that Cader Hajiar closely moved with even the Mahanayake Theras of Malwatte and Asgiriya. He was a true friend of the people of all communities; Sinhalese, Tamils and Muslims alike, the like of whom, perhaps, shall not be born for another century. He, therefore, suggested the creation of an “Abdul Cader Trust” so that his benevolence be continued among all people in the country, Azwer said.
Former Prime Minister D. M. Jayaratne presided. Central Province Chief Minister Sarath Ekanayake, Posts and Muslim Affairs Minister M H A Haleem, senior citizen Peter Gangadara, Provincial Council members Hidayath Sathar, Lafir Hajiar, former MP S. Rajaratnam and several others also addressed the gathering.
Former PC member Mohamed Amjad Rafeek proposed the vote of thanks. A resolution was passed to request the Provincial Council to rename Ambagamuwa road as Abdul Cader Hajiar Mawatha.
Raja Tilakaratna
Conscientious professional
K R M Tilakaratna (Raja to his friends), who passed away recently was the pioneer in supervisory development activities in our country. After providing valuable services to the Industrial Development Board, as an enterprise development executive, he joined the National Institute of Business Management as a trainer/consultant and rose to the position of Director of Supervisory Development within a short time.
Raja received intensive training in the United Kingdom and ILO training centres in the field to Training Within Industry. He used his expertise to train a large number of supervisory personnel in our public enterprises and the training programmes he introduced in the seventies are being continued even at present with slight amendments. He travelled all over the island conducting in-house training programmes in most of the state corporations and the NIBM training centres in Kurunegala and Kandy.
Raja was an indefatigable worker and a management education professional who contributed immensely to the development of our managers and supervisors thereby assisting their organizations to enhance productivity. His training sessions were informative and entertaining, and he helped many to progress in their careers.
Raja was a conscientious professional who fulfilled his official responsibilities to the satisfaction of all his superiors, peers and ‘students’. He was a very sincere friend and one of the most pleasant persons to work with. He shared his expertise with all his colleagues and provided professional assistance to anybody who sought it. He was a livewire during the many official trips and social activities conducted at the NIBM.
After his retirement, he provided voluntary services to many of the community and social development activities in and around Polgasovita where he resided with his family. He took a very active role in helping his fellow men to enhance their quality of lives. He led a simple and exemplary life, and was a role model to his colleagues, friends, students and community members.
May he attain Nibbana!

Yasarathne Weerakkody
My friend and brother
My dearest brother Yasarathne Weerakkody passed away at the age of 87. 1 am younger to him by 1 and half years.
Being in the same age group, we grew up together like friends. We participated in all activities together such as schooling sports, athletics, cadet training and picnics.
After completing his school life, he found employment in the Department of Census and Statistics as an Investigator.
In appreciation of his selfless service in that department, he was offered a scholarship to India for one year for further studies in modern technology in the field of Census and Statistics.
After retirement, he was appointed President of the Mediation board (Samatha Mandala) in the Negombo district, an honorary job and held that position for several years with a lot of interest and enthusiasm. He solved many complex issues and problems to the satisfaction of all parties and communities. His judgments were upheld and regarded as impartial as well as reasonable.
He was a hard worker, built a house each for all his five children. He was a strict disciplinarian, meticulously methodical, teetotaler, a vegetarian and a lot more.
His great interest was Buddha Dharma. He observed the five precepts (Pancha Seela) from his young days. As age advanced, he spent days and weeks in hermitages and temples in the practice of meditation.
His wife predeceased him exactly one year before him. He was survived by five children, four of them girls, we settled with their spouses here and abroad. His only son Yasath is a consultant ENT Surgeon who is married to a doctor. I am in grief with them. My deepest sympathies to all of them and their loved ones.
May his onward journey in Sansara be smooth and brief, and may he realize the supreme bliss of Nibbana.
