UNP protesters say, fellow  member attacked by SLPP candidate

United National Party (UNP) members staged a protest outside the Suriyawewa Police Station, yesterday, alleging that their candidate contesting for the Suriyawewa Pradeshiya Sabha was attacked by a candidate contesting from the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna’s (SLPP’s) second list.
The UNP candidate thus attacked has been identified as Sujith Muthukumara. On January 31, he had been engaged in campaign work when he was attacked by the individual in the Hathporuwa area.
The Suriyawewa Police, however, reported that they had already acted on the complaint and arrested the relevant SLPP member. He has been produced before the Embilipitiya Magistrate’s Court.
