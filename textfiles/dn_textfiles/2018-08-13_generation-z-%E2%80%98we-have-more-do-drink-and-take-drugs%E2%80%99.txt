Generation Z: ‘We have more to do than drink and take drugs’

They drink less, take far fewer drugs, and have made teenage pregnancy a near anomaly. Generation Z – one of several terms used to describe post-millennial youth born after 1996 – prefer juice bars to pub crawls, rank quality family time ahead of sex and prioritise good grades before friendship, at least according to a report published by the British Pregnancy Advisory Service last week.
An onslaught of sneering headlines followed, characterising today’s youth as boring, sensible and hopelessly screen-addicted.
So, are the kids all right?
“We have so much more to do than [just] drink and take drugs,” says Demi Babalola, a 19-year-old philosophy and sociology student. “I’m not surprised those [statistics] show that’s the case: it makes sense. We have a lot more to distract us now.”
Older people
What’s her biggest time stealer? “Social media.” Babalola toggles between Snapchat, Twitter and Instagram, although she rolls her eyes at the mention of Facebook, full as it is of “older people”.
But it’s not just the breadth of entertainment and culture that is so instantly available – and disposable – to Babalola and her peers. There is also a growing feeling that the preoccupations of her parents’ generation seem, well, a bit lame.
“Going out takes a lot of effort: it’s boring, repetitive and expensive,” she says. “Obviously, I used to go out a lot in my first year [at university], but now we do more kickbacks.”
To the uninitiated, a kickback is the sophisticated Gen Z sweet spot between the lairy house parties of yore – the ones typified by vomit on the parental carpet and a trashing of the family bathroom – and a pre-teen sleepover.
“We hang out, we listen to music, make our own food, and play games,” she says. “We’ll probably organise it a couple of days before.”
Video games
Lewis Allely, 14, from Cornwall, agrees. “We’re quite different [from your generation] because there’s more stuff to do at each other’s houses and we have more technology – like, we have video games.”
His teacher, Mr Worthington, laughs. “I gave them a free lesson the other day where they could do what they wanted.” He knew a mass bunk- off to the park or similar would be off the cards. “I came back after an hour and they were all sitting in a circle, looking down at their phones and chatting.”
The cliche that many young people spend far too much time online, instead of indulging in a romanticised form of rebellion, may have some truth, but as futurologist Rhiannon McGregor points out, Gen Z-ers are more cautious and risk-averse than their parents, partly because that technology exists.
“They’re aware from an early age of how they’re portrayed online and offline, so they curate themselves in a more conservative way,” she says. (In other words, no one wants to be publicly shamed getting messy or being recklessly daft.)
“But they’re also more socially aware and see themselves as part of a global community.
It’s easier to get and feel connected to someone in Africa or Asia and share concerns about climate change, for instance.” Clara Finnigan, 22, who grew up in Devon and is in her final year at the University of Arts London, points out that one size doesn’t fit all. She still goes out, “often to gay clubs”.
Political state
She believes her generation is unfairly judged and that it reports levels of stress and depression that are higher than ever because of the economic and political state of the world it has inherited.
“The whole anxiety of not having stability in your future is something that is definitely very present. I won’t probably ever own my own house, unless I get really lucky.”
