Only 34 percent of electricity can be provided: Ajith Perera

 
Power and Renewable Energy Deputy Minister Ajith Perera said today (8) that reservoirs can only produce 34 percent of country’s electricity requirement.
The Deputy Minister urged the public to use electricity sparingly at the weekly press briefing in Parliament.
Deputy Minister Perera said that showers experienced in the last few weeks did not reach reservoir areas, draning water levels to hit the lowest in 10 years. 
‘Western province residents are not even aware of the drought’ the Deputy Minister said.
‘We have not imposed any power cuts’, the Deputy Minister added.
