Police lifesaving units near water bodies to safeguard pilgrims

Police headquarters acting on the instructions of IGP Pujith Jayasundera, has deployed Police lifesaving units and volunteer lifesaving teams near main tanks and water bodies in Anuradhapura, Polonnaruwa and Dambulla and the beach in Tangalle.
This is for the safety of pilgrims bathing in them during the Poson season from June 6 to 11. The lifeguards are trained by Regional Police Instructors.
Police Headquarters in a press release said bathers in these water bodies should pay special attention to the following factors to ensure their safety.
"Pay attention to the warning signs set up near tanks and other water bodies, follow instructions given by lifesavers in using water bodies, use areas designated as 'safe' for bathing, avoid wading into water after liquor, prevent bathing during night and at spots infested with crocodiles, use lifesaving jackets during boat travel, and check whether the coxswain has a valid licence, avoid wading into the water near the sluice gate or spots with a heavy current, be extremely careful in using areas with water since digging had been carried out to obtain water during drought, and keep an awareness about the number of the group entering the water body for bathing and doing a headcount on return to the banks to ensure all are safe," the release stated.
