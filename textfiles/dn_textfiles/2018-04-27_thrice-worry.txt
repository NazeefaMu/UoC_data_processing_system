Thrice the worry!

The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge have begun introducing their new prince to family members, as the world awaits an announcement on the baby's name.
Prince William and Kate have retreated to the sanctuary of Kensington Palace after showing off their third child to the world on the steps of the Lindo Wing.
As the Duke and Duchess settle into life as a family of five, the first visitors began arriving at their west London home on Tuesday. Pippa Middleton, the Duchess's sister, was the first to be pictured after meeting the as-yet-unnamed baby.
Prince Harry and Meghan Markle could have been the first to visit as they are neighbours at Kensington Palace. The new baby prince's great-grandmother the Queen, 92, is still at Windsor Castle with the Duke of Edinburgh who is recuperating after a hip operation.
Prince Charles said in a statement on Tuesday afternoon that he and Camilla, the Duchess of Cornwall, are "both so pleased at the news". He added: "It is a great joy to have another grandchild, the only trouble is I don’t know how I am going to keep up with them."
The name of the baby Prince of Cambridge, who was born on Monday at 11.01am weighing 8lb 7oz, has yet to be unveiled. Royals traditionally keep the public guessing before revealing their choice and William and Kate will want to share the name with the Queen and the rest of their family before making it public. Duke says they are 'very happy' but have 'thrice the worry now'
Smiling broadly, the Duchess was dressed in a vibrant red Jenny Packham dress with a white lace collar, reminiscent of William's late mother Diana, Princess of Wales - who wore red and white outside the Lindo Wing after Prince Harry was born in 1984.
As William and Kate headed home after appearing in front of the banks of cameras with their seven-hour-old son, the Duke said they were "very happy" and "very delighted".
He joked, holding up three fingers, that he had "thrice the worry now", adding: "We didn't keep you waiting too long this time."
The Duke and Duchess thanked the hospital for their care and the public for their wishes. Kensington Palace said: "Their Royal Highnesses would like to thank all staff at the hospital for the care and treatment they have received.
"They would also like to thank everyone for their warm wishes."
