Emirates to fly Airbus A380 to Colombo

For the first time in Sri Lanka’s aviation history, Emirates will launch its double-deck Airbus A380 aircraft on flights to Colombo commencing August 14.
An official from Ministry of Transport and Civil Aviation said this service would be a once-a-week flight and it would operate with a stopover in a destination in the Far East. The Airbus A380 flies to Sri Lanka subsequent to the airport runway expansion concluded last April.
The Airbus A380 is a double-deck, wide-body, four-engine jet airliner manufactured by European manufacturer Airbus.
It is the world’s largest passenger airliner and the airports at which it operates have upgraded facilities to accommodate it.
