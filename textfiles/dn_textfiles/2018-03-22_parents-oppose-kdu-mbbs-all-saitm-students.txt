Parents oppose KDU MBBS for all SAITM students

The parents of students in state medical faculties are against the awarding of the KDU (SAITM) MBBS degree to all students absorbed into the Kotelawala Defence University (KDU).
State Medical Students Parents Union Secretary, attorney Gamini Ekanayake said there are 101 unqualified students in SAITM and 40 of them have only Ordinary Level passes while another 28 of them have three simple passes in Advanced level examination (3S).Efforts are being made by a handful of parents to lobby for them to gain a KDU (SAITM) MBBS which does not have SLMC recognition.
“The President is listening to advice offered to him by a few persons who do not have any background or understanding on medical education.One of them is a strong pro-SAITM person. A justifiable framework to solve the SAITM issue by offering qualified students a KDU MBBS degree as proposed by the President himself will not become a reality with these persons,” he said.
