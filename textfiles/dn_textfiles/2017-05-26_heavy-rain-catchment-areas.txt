Heavy rain in catchment areas

Heavy rain was experienced in the catchment areas of the reservoirs in the hill country on Wednesday afternoon.
Maussakelle received 43 millimetres of rain during the 24 hours ending 6 am on yesterday.
Irrigation engineers said it was a welcome rain since the water level of Maussakelle had decreased to 37 feet below spill level due to the drought earlier. Maussakelle reservoir feeds water to Laxapana, new Laxapane, Polpitiya, Wimalasurendra and Canyon, belonging to the Laxapana complex.
