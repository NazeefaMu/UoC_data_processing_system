Over 120 competitors for Mahagastota Speed Hill Climb

The hills of Nanu Oya will roar with the revving of the engines and the screeching of the brakes when over 120 motorcycles and motorcars including Formula cars burn the tracks when the 83rd Mahagastota Speed Hill Climb organised by the Ceylon Motor Sports Club gets underway at the Mahagastota Division of Pedro Group, Blackpool, Nanu Oya on Saturday, April 10. The first set of motorcycles is expected to be flagged off at 8 am.
This speed hill climb will herald the motor racing season during the Nuwara Eliya Festivities season is also the oldest organised motor racing event in the country dating back to 1934. This event has been held annually except in 1934 when the scene was shifted to St. James Group, Hali Ela as the then Vicar of Nuwara Eliya was opposed to having this motor racing event on a Easter Sunday. In some years this event had been conducted twice the same year. Every tenth year it is being conducted in August during the mini season.
Those were the days when it was a two day meet when on the first day the official practices were conducted. A few years back this was done away with and the competitors go into the event straight away. Official practices helps the competitors to get themselves familiar with the track and where they have to be careful and where they could step on the gas.
The present overall course record holder is Nishan Weerasooriya who drove his Mitsubishi Evolution in a dare devil style to clock 34.17 seconds which broke the existing record of 34.348 held by Darin Weerasinghe. Nishan Weerasooriya's timing is the fastest ever in the 83 year old history of Mahagastota and is the fastest for stock cars and the Overall course record. Nishan Weerasooriya's timing is great following his earlier idea of retiring from the motor racing scene and in fact kept away from it for a few years and was also not heard of.
But last year like the mythical phoenix rose from the ashes to be in the limelight again. But this year he will not be there to improve his own record.
In Nishan Weerasooriya's absence it will be in the hands of Darin Weerasinghe to set up a new mark. Daring Weerasinghe has earlier held the course record in his Subaru, Impressa, which 34.348 seconds established in 2014.
