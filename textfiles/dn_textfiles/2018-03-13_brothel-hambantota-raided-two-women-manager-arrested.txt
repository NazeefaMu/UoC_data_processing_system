Brothel in Hambantota raided, two women, manager arrested

Two women were arrested by the Anti-narcotics Flying Squad in Tangalle from a brothel near the Hambantota Magistrate’s Court last Sunday on a tip off. A manager of the location was also arrested.
They had been engaging in the business for many years in the guise of a place that rented rooms for couples.
Chinese women were also among their employees.
The two women are residents of Negombo and Kaduwela.
The women and the manager were produced before the Hambantota Magisrate’s Court. Investigations are continuing.
