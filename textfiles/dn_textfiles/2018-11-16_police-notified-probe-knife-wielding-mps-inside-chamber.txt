Police notified to probe knife wielding MPs inside Chamber

Complaints have been made to police against two MPs who smuggled knifes into the Chamber and instigated violence yesterday, Consumer, Cooperative Development and Christian Religious Affairs Minister Johnston Fernando said.
Addressing a press conference held at the Prime Minister’s Office in Colombo yesterday he said a written complaint has already been made to the IGP and the lawyers are now preparing relevant documents to institute action against the offending MPs for their behaviour. This act is illegal and police should conduct a full investigation into the breach of security inside the Chamber, he said.
MP Indika Anuruddha said harmful objects were brought into the Parliament and MP Ranjan Ramanayake had pulled out a knife from his waist and threatened them. State Minister Lakshman Yapa Abeywardana said only the Speaker and the President do not undergo security checks before entering Parliament and all the other MPs need to undergo a security check.
“It is baffling how two knifes entered the Chamber without any detection,’’ he said.
