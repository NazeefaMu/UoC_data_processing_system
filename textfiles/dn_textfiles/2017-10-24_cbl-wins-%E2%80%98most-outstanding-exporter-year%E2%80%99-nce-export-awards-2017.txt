NCE Export Awards recognize and reward the outstanding service of Sri Lankan exporters in the global market. Organized by the National Chamber of Exporters of Sri Lanka (NCE), the prestigious event was held under the patronage of Premier Ranil Wickremesinghe.
CBL clinched four prestigious Gold Awards including the Most Outstanding Exporter 2017 – overall Gold, Most Outstanding Exporter 2017 - Industry Sector – Gold, the Most Value Added Exporter 2017 - Products Sector – Gold, and the Most Outstanding Exporter 2017 - Industry Sector Extra Large (Confectionary and Beverage) – Gold.
The eminent panel of judges comprised independent professionals provided by the world renowned audit firm Ernst & Young. The NCE Awards not only recognize outstanding exporters and their notable contribution towards the industry and the national economy, but also plays a key role in setting standards to other local exporters.
Commenting on the occasion, General Manager Exports of Ceylon Biscuits, Jude Rubera said, “We are delighted about winning this year’s overall Gold Award in ‘Most Outstanding Exporter 2017’ in addition to three coveted gold awards. CBL has continuously maintained its superior quality across all brands, and especially our flagship brand Munchee has taken the Sri Lankan prestige throughout the world. Sri Lanka’s traditional exports such as tea, rubber, gems and apparels have garnered a substantial demand in the global market. And we are truly pleased that a non-traditional product such as biscuits has come into the global limelight and is competing on par with our export giants. I would like to thank all our valuable consumers, traders, distributors, and other stakeholders for their constant support and patronage that has propelled our brand towards this notable achievement.”

Above all, CBL maintains high quality across all platforms, allowing the Sri Lankan and overseas consumers to taste and experience the richness and goodness of CBL biscuits in the same manner.
