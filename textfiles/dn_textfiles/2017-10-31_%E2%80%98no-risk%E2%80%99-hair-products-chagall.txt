‘No risk’ hair products at Chagall

Hair Wizard Gerald Solomons the founder of Chagall salon, promises his clients Amonia free, hence ‘Risk Free’ hair products. Gerald who has clients from all over the world jetting down, just so that he could style their hair says that in the wake of hair dye and related products being linked to a higher rate of breast cancer amongst women who colour their hair more than six times a year, says that at Chagall he uses parabin free, amonia free and PPD free hair dyes and products which do not cause his clients any harm.
Professor Keith Mokbel, breast cancer surgeon, who has carried out research has aid that his study suggests that dyeing hair increases the risk of developing the dreaded disease of breast cancer by as much as 14 percent.
“What I find concerning is the fact that the industry recommends women should dye their hair every four to six weeks . Although further work is required to confirm our results our findings suggest that exposure to hair dyes may contribute to breast cancer risk”. Professor Mokbel advises women to switch to hair dyes that contain the minimum concentration of aromatic amines such as PPD [ less than 2 percent ]. PPD stands for paraphenylenediamine, a chemical often used in hair dyes .
“ At Chagall we only use products such as L’oreal INOA (Not Tested On Animals), Paul Michelle (Not Tested On Animals), Schwarzkop, So Pure (Not Tested On Animals) , Kevin Murphy (Not Tested On Animals), however these cost more and sometimes clients insist we use the cheaper products which contain ammonia and PPD and other carcinogenic ingredients . Needless to say we always caution them and tell them they use it at their own risk”, averred Gerald.
“I always recommend that my clients use ‘safe’ products because I can confidently say that they are safe to use. Price is not everything”, and Gerald admonishes his clients to go the extra step and use such products. “At Chagall I am very conscious of the fact that my reputation rests on the products I use and the capabilities of my staff, hence I recommend only the best and the safest of brands”. A firm advocate that one should look after one’s crowning glory, Gerald is a rare hair dresser who actually advises you against using too many products, colour and blow drying. He recommends Moroccan and Argon oil for the hair and has always advised against over colouring and blow drying.
A firm believer in doing things ‘his way’ he constantly advises clients to ‘step out of the box’ they are in and reinvent themselves and he is always right in his advice, be it hair, make up or clothes.
