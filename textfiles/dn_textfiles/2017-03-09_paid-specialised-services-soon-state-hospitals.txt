Paid specialised services soon at state hospitals

Specialised paid medical services such as consultants’ services, medical tests, surgeries etc will soon be made available at state hospitals after 4.00 p.m., Health Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne said.
Minister Dr. Senaratne said at present, the Government spends Rs. 987 million annually to repair various medical equipment which needs upgrading every three years. But, the state sector uses this highly valuable medical equipment for only eight hours per day while the private sector use them throughout the day. The Minister was speaking after commissioning a new MRI Scanner for the Colombo National Hospital.
Minister Senaratne said the paid services should be made available at very reasonable prices as it would also bring in an income for the free health sector. The health expenditure can be minimised. Several requests were received to commence a paid services section in every state hospital to cater to the people willing to obtain the services. “The health trade unions will oppose this move but this is not privatising the free health service. They should organise their trade union activities aiming at building the health sector,” the Minister had stated.
