Those who lost passport documents to the floods can reapply

Persons who lost their documents in the recent floods and landslides can apply for their passports with a letter produced by the respective Divisional Secretary, Home Affairs Minister Vajira Abeywardena said. He said anybody who urgently wants to get the passports but has lost the birth certificate, National Identity Card, marriage certificate or any other pertinent document, may apply with a recommendation letter by the Divisional Secretary.
The Divisional Secretary in his/her letter should state that the applicant has been affected by the recent disaster situation. He said a circular to provide this relief has been issued to the relevant authorities, adding that it would be presented for Cabinet approval.
The minister made these comments while addressing a press conference at Sirikotha yesterday.
