Firms opt for flexible working to retain top staff - Regus

Remote working is becoming ever more the norm with the majority firms reporting the focus has shifted to measuring outputs rather than time spent in the office
New research by global workplace provider Regus has revealed that four fifths of firms are shifting their focus from relying on time spent in the office, to measuring their individual outputs with results-based assessments, signalling that remote working is becoming ever more customary.
According to Regus's new research- a survey canvassing the opinions of over 44,000 people from more than 100 different countries - 61% of firms report that businesses in their sector also use flexible working as a mechanism for retaining and attracting top staff.
With more and more businesses embracing flexible working, implementing successful remote management processes is essential to ensuring top workers are recognised and developed. Out of the 44,000 plus surveyed, 63% manage a remote worker or team, yet, only 43% of firms have put in place special training. Excelling in remote management, unsurprisingly, plays an integral part in nurturing employee relations, motivation and loyalty.
Additional key global findings:
* Over half of respondents (54%) confirm that companies like theirs are looking to increase the number of remote workers;
* 67% confirm that senior management trusts that flexible working can be productive;
* 46% are managed by a remote manager at least some of the time;
* 76% declare that senior management can actually benefit by becoming more productive if they can work flexibly.
Regus Sri Lanka Country Manager Dr. Nirmal De Silva said the huge cultural shift in the workplace towards flexible working continues to grow.
This latest research shows that the business people are embracing this change. With improved productivity, better staff retention and lower operating costs at stake, implementing successful remote management processes can clearly bring businesses huge benefits." "Given the significant surge in flexible working, it is positive news that firms are also adapting their measurement of employees to fit and are shifting the focus from an office face-time mentality to one of measuring real outputs regardless of location. One important caveat remains, however, while globally workers managing a remote workforce or being managed remotely are increasing, too few firms are investing in specific training which could improve the transition from fixed office workforce to mobile workforce making it even smoother and more productive.
