Army General Amnesty receives good response

A total of 5,412 Officers and Other Rankers of the Army who are Absent Without Official Leave (AWOL) have so far reported back to their respective Regimental Headquarters to receive their legal discharge under the ongoing 24 day-long General Amnesty period that ends on November 15,2017.
As of Monday (November 6), six Officers, six Officer Cadets and 5,400 Other Ranks of the Army, considered as absentees sought the legal discharge during the past fortnight after the General Amnesty period came into effect on October 23,2017.
The General Amnesty that was announced to coincide with the 68th Army anniversary would enable Army absentees to directly reach respective Regimental Headquarters and receive their legal discharge.
