‘Masterminds behind adulteration of SL  pepper will be nabbed’

Although pepper grown in Sri Lanka has earned world renown for is high quality, its world reputation is at stake due to a racket masterminded by a few exporters who undermined its quality by adulterating Sri Lankan pepper exports by mixing it with the low-quality product from Bangladesh at mid sea, Agriculture Minister Mahinda Amaraweera said.
The Minister disclosed this when a delegation from the All Ceylon Farmers’ Congress (Samastha Lanka Govi Sammelanaya) met him at his Ministry on June 12, to discuss measures to ensure a fair price for pepper farmers.
The Minister said since this was a deliberate attempt to destroy the international fame earned by Sri Lankan pepper, the government would call in the CID to investigate the matter and bring the culprits involved to book.
A Ministry release said many farmer problems figured at this meeting. These included problems concerning irrigation, fertiliser distribution, ensuring a fair price for pepper by prohibiting imports during the harvesting season, introduction of new technology to farmers, and soil conservation and formulation of a systematic programme to resolve them.
The Minister assured the delegation that issues raised would be given due consideration to bring about early solutions.
