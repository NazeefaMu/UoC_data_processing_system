No stocks at bars if people were supplied liquor at March 17 rally: Keheliya

 
If everyone participated in the Joint Opposition rally on March 17 at the Hyde Park Grounds, Colombo had bottles sticking out of their armpits, it would have apparently caused all bars and spirit outlets in the Colombo district to go out of stock, Joint Opposition Leader and former minister Keheliya Rambukwella said.
"All bottles would have gone out of display from every bar shelve in the province if that had been the case," he said.
He was speaking at the weekly press briefing of the Joint Opposition.
Rambukwella was reacting to a speech by former President Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga made at the Gampaha Balamandala meeting of the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) three days ago, where she said that people came to March 17 rally of the Joint Opposition because they were supplied with bottles of liquor.
Ranbukwella said: "I must say that the act she put on to display how a drunk person would wander, waver and stagger with a bottle under his armpit, appeared so real, as in real life."
"On the contrary, I think that sometimes it is necessary to put some act to pacify oneself when one is in shock and in fear," he said.
"However I wish that they do not display such behaviour to underestimate the people or to mock them," he added.
