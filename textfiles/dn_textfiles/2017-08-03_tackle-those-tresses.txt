Tackle those tresses!

Hair care is a part of grooming. It is just as important to put effort in maintaining your tresses as much as you would in maintaining your wardrobe. The kind of products you use should depend on the type of hair you have, and not on your whims and fancies. While there are no fixed rules as to which shampoo and conditioner you should use, there are certain parameters you should keep in mind, so as to make an informed decision.
Analyze your hair
Analyzing ones hair involves examining the hair to determine the amount of hair, size of each hair strand, and the overall health of the strand. To check the density (amount of hairs on head), look at a patch of hair on top of your head and observe how many hairs are growing out of this patch. If there are so many hairs so that you can barely see the scalp, this is an indication of thick density.
When the hairs are spaced out on the scalp - this is known as thin density.
Look at an individual hair strand to find out whether the strand is thick and wide, or if it is thin when you check the texture (thickness of individual strands).To determine your hair texture you could even compare it with another person’s hair.
Find your hair strength
Thick hair is stronger than thin hair by nature, regardless of curl pattern. You need to follow two steps to find the strength (a combined result of porosity and density of hair overall) of the hair.
First, porosity is determined, then elasticity.
Porosity is the amount of water retained by the hair. Porous hair is generally more damaged, and has a tendency to absorb more liquid, but it will not retain as much moisture.
Hair with low porosity is considered healthy and resistant, and can withstand stronger chemicals and services than porous hair.
To determine the porosity, take a few hairs and slide your fingers up the hair shaft to check if the hair feels rough or smooth. If the hairs cuticles are raised and the hair feels rough, this indicates that the hair is porous. If the hair is non-porous, the cuticles should feel smooth.
Elasticity is the final step in the analysis and the part that makes your final determination of your hair’s strength. Take a single hair from the crown of your head, and grab both ends and stretch the hair.
If it snaps right away, the hair lacks elasticity. If it takes longer, the hair has a lot of elasticity.
Over washing your hair
There’s no harm in washing your hair every day. In fact, if you do any of the following things, you should always wash your hair:
1) Any exercise that makes your scalp particularly sweaty.
2) Use of gels or waxes.
3) Use of hair sprays or any other cosmetics that contact your scalp.
Over washing is possible if you are not engaging in exercise that makes you sweaty, or using hair gels, waxes, sprays or other hair cosmetics, as skin sebum is your hairs ‘natural conditioner’. It can make your hair shiny and protects your hair. Washing your hair too frequently may make your hair dry, making it appear unhealthy, due to lack of sebum.
Shampoo for your hair type
Using the incorrect shampoo could cause the hair and scalp to dry out. Using products that are too moisturizing on an oily scalp could make the condition worse. Therefore, if you use the correct shampoo for your hair type, you will benefit from it.
Conditioning-shampoos vs separate shampoos and conditioners
A shampoo cleanses the hair while a conditioner provides shine and improves the handling of the hair. Conditioning-shampoos can be better than two separate bottles if you're showering every day or have curly or brittle hair. Since daily shampooing can strip hair of natural oils and dull color, Conditioning-shampoos are less harsh and damaging. However when using these conditioning shampoos you should be aware of the product build up. If you have thin or oily hair, a separate shampoo and conditioner is better with a lighter formula as it may be too heavy for oily hair types because it will weigh down the fine hair strands.
Changing shampoos on a regular basis
You should change your shampoo on a regular basis because your hair's natural chemical balance is altered by the shampoo and you'll begin to see a change in the results you get from it.
In the case of moisturizing and conditioning shampoos you can get an eventual build-up on the hair shaft, which may leave the hair flat and listless after repeated use. Conversely, deep-cleaning or build-up removing shampoos can strip away more than just the product build-up they're designed to remove when they are used over and over, leaving hair dry and more susceptible to damage.
The best recommendation is to select a couple of shampoo formulas that you like. If your regular shampoo is a moisturizing shampoo, then use a clarifying shampoo every third or fourth time you shampoo. If you normally use a build-up removing shampoo to get rid of the residue from daily styling products, be sure to switch to a moisture-rich formula to maintain the balance of moisture in your hair.
pH balancing shampoos
Human hair and scalp oil, sebum, has a pH balance of between 4.5 and 5.5 and is slightly acidic. This natural hair acidity prevents fungi and bacteria in the hair and scalp, and keeps the cuticle closed and healthy. Shampoos can be either acidic or alkaline. A shampoo that is “pH balanced” is slightly acidic. It ensures that the hair and skin’s natural moisture is maintained, helps to keep cuticles closed and keeps your hair healthy.
Shampoos for coloured hair
Shampoos for coloured hair claim to “enhance or revitalize richness and depth and add shine”. They make your hair shiny and moisturized, keeping it looking and feeling great. When hair is in good condition, you get the shine and an enhanced appearance. The hair looks better overall.
These shampoos will not protect your colour from fading or add any dye to your hair. However, lately some brands have come out with products that contain dyes that are supposed to stick to your hair, thus making your hair colour last longer.
But these dyes also do not work most of the time. They are simply added to make the product look nicer and give it a certain colour, but won’t stick to your hair and provide any colour enhancing benefits for your hair.
