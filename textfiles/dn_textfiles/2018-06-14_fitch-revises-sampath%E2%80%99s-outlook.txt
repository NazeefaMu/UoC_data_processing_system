Fitch Revises Sampath’s Outlook

Fitch Ratings has affirmed the National Long-Term Rating of Sampath Bank PLC at ‘A+(lka)’ and revised the Outlook to Stable from Negative.
Fitch has also affirmed Sampath’s subordinated debentures at ‘A(lka)’.
The revision in the Outlook reflects Fitch’s expectation that the bank would be able to sustain higher capital buffers as it continues to focus on capital management and earnings retention while expanding its market share. Sampath’s rating also reflects its higher risk appetite, growing franchise and satisfactory asset quality.
