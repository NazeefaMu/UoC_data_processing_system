Avant Garde suspects bailed

Southern Provincial Galle High Court Judge yesterday ordered the release of former Store Keeper of the Avant Garde floating armoury, Colonel Don Thomas Albert Wijethunga and ex-Operations Manager of the vessel, Major Sumudu Nishantha De Costa on a cash bail of Rs. 500,000 and a surety of Rs. 2.5 million each.
The High Court Judge further imposed a foreign travel ban on them and ordered them to hand over their passports to the custody of the judiciary. The suspects were also directed to report to the Colombo Criminal Investigations Department every last Sunday of each month.
MV Avant Garde was seized by Sri Lanka Navy on October 13, 2015 for keeping a firearm depository on board. It was handed it over to the Criminal Investigations Department (CID) for subsequent action.
