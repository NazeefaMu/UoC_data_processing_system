Sri Lankans not affected by Qatar situation: Qatar Ambassador

The situation which developed in Qatar has no impact on the Sri Lankans living and working in Qatar.
Therefore, there is no need to panic, Qatar Ambassador to Sri Lanka Rashid Bin Shafie al - Marri informed Labour and Trade Union Relations Minister W.D.J. Seneviratne. The Ambassador met Minister Seneviratne at the Labour and Trade Union Relations Ministry recently to discuss the issue. According to the Ambassador, the new development has not affected the daily functions of Qatar. A large number of Sri Lankans work in Qatar.
Minister Seneviratne made a request to the Ambassador to provide all requirements for the Sri Lankans living and working in Qatar and to make arrangements to explain the truth about the situation to them.
