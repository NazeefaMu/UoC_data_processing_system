PIN FERNANDO TROPHY 2018 QUARTER FINALISTS FOUND:
Top Seed Mahendra beaten in pre-quarters

The prestigious annual board event for the Pin Fernando Trophy for Men and Pam Fernando Trophy for Ladies played at the RCGC and proudly sponsored by the family business UTE Engineering is played in the memory of the legendary late Pin Fernando the Match-play Champ of Sri Lanka and his late wife Pam Fernando who was recorded in the Guinness Book of World Records as the Oldest to win a National Championship – Sri Lanka Ladies Amateur Championship.
The Pin Fernando Trophy Match-play stage was set alight with the Top Seeded Mahendra Jayasekera beaten by young rising star Zaffar Sikkander 1 up. 2017 winner Vinod Weerasinghe didn’t take part this year and in his absence there are two youngsters through to the Quarters, namely Zaffar Sikkander and Armand Flamer Caldera (the youngest qualifier) who could make a bid for the Trophy. 2017 Pin Fernando trophy runner-up Tyronne Weerackody had a tough
encounter to overcome the captain of the RCG Avancka Herath. In an entertaining tight match Tyronne beat Captain Avancka on the 19 th , the first sudden death hole after being all-square after eighteen. The Pam Fernando Trophy Quarters and Pin Fernando Trophy Quarters look very competitive and some good Golf is expected.
