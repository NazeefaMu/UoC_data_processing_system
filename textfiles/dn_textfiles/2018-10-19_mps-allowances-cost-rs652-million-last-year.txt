MPs allowances cost Rs.652 million last year

Parliament had spent Rs.652 million to pay the allowances of MPs last year, a senior Parliament official said.
He told the Daily News that Parliament had spent Rs.118 million to pay the MPs’ salaries and sittings allowance, Rs. 115 million to pay for the MPs’ fuel allowance, Rs.135 million to pay for the MPs’ postal and telecommunication allowance, Rs.259 million to pay for MPs’ rental and Rs 25 million to pay for the MPs’ transport allowance.
The ministers’ salaries are not included above as those are paid by the respective ministries, but ministers too are entitled to the above mentioned fuel, postal and telecommunication, rental and sittings allowances.
He said the total expenditure of Parliament in 2017 stood at Rs 2,443 million, but out of that sum Rs.939 million was spent to pay for the salaries and allowances of nearly 900 Parliamentary staff.
“If you divide the total expenditure by 365, you get Rs 6.6 million as an average for a day’s expenditure in Parliament. Parliament sits about 100 days per year on an average. On each Parliament sitting day, we spend Rs.300,000 to prepare meals for about 150 MPs, and additional cost for electricity, water and members’ sittings allowance. There is no mechanism to calculate a sitting day’s expenditure separately. If you divide the total expenditure by the average number of sitting days you get about Rs.24 million,” he explained.
