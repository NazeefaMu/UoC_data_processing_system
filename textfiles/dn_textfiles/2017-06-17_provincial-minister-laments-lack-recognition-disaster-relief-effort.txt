Provincial minister laments lack of recognition for disaster relief effort

Contributions by media personnel and state officials by going out of their way to help the flood and landslide affected by forsaking their lives and undergoing privations, have not gained proper recognition and appreciation, Southern Province Education Minister Chandima Rasaputra said.
He made this observation during a press conference at his Ministry at Dakshina Paya, Labuduwa, Galle to mark the award of financial aid to 16 media personnel affected by the recent natural disaster, yesterday.
Minister Rasaputra said media personnel went out of their way staking their safety to provide correct information about the damage to the public during the disaster. Some of them climbed dangerous terrain to capture the devastation caused on lenses.
If their lives were lost, their families would have fallen destitute.
Media personnel who rendered a selfless service during the recent catastrophe should come in for special praise, the provincial minister said.
He said state officials worked day and night to render optimum possible and to keep state machinery moving. Divisional Secretaries took steps to provide cooked meals to people in relief camps on the instructions of the district secretariat.
Education Ministry Secretary Y. Wickramasiri also spoke.
Minister Rasaputra handed over cheques to the affected journalists.
