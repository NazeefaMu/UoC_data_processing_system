39 students released on bail

Thirty nine students attached to Higher National Diploma in Accountancy (HNDA) arrested in connection with committing offences at a protest rally opposite the Higher Education Ministry were yesterday ordered to be released on bail by the Colombo Chief Magistrate.
Accordingly, each suspect including two Buddhist monks and five females were ordered to be released on a personal bail of Rs.100,000 by Chief Magistrate Gihan Pilapitiya. Producing the suspects before Court, the Cinnamon Garden police alleged that the students could be charged over several offences including assaulting police officers, causing disturbance to public peace and obstructing the regular traffic flow while being members of an unlawful assembly.
Police stated that a group of students commenced the protest from the Colombo Fort railway station towards the Higher Education Ministry premises urging that several their demands be fulfilled.
Police told Court that they prevented the protestors from marching towards the ministry premises informing them that they cannot meet the Minister of Higher Education since he was not in the ministry. Police complained to the Chief Magistrate that the students who behaved in an unruly manner ignored the police warning-not to be members of the unlawful assembly. Police stated that they were compelled to use minimal force to disperse the unlawful assembly using water canons, tear gas and police batons. Police further said that six police personnel were injured during the skirmish with the protesters and eight students were also injured during the incident. Counsel Gunaratne Wanninayake and Sanjaya Gamage appearing for the suspects informed Court that the attack by police could be considered as a tragedy day of the Good Governance regime. They stated that their clients had been illegally arrested by police while they were engaged in a peaceful protest. The Defence Counsel told that the students were preparing to lodge complaints with the President, The Prime Minister and the Police Commission over the incident.
