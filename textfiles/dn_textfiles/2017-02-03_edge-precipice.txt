On the edge of a precipice

The pot of water is boiling. The crab in it is swimming, oblivious to the predicament that awaits it. The predicament of our people and the country at the present juncture also looks similar.
We are on the edge of a precipice. The economy is in disaster mode. The fact is we are a heavily indebted nation. In fact it has been so for some time. In 2015 our total external debt was US dollars 44.8 billon. A leading economist disclosed at a seminar this week that debt commitments would double in 2019. It is a scenario that is dreadful even to think of.
Politicians are blaming each other for this state of affairs. There seems to be a competition to disown the responsibility for the debt among the present and former rulers. In fact it did not appear overnight. By the time the new Government came our foreign debt had risen to 54.4 percent of the GDP. New debts were added to that burden in the last two years. We are caught in a vicious circle from which it is hard to extricate ourselves.
Foreign exchange earnings
The only way to ease the debt burden is to increase foreign exchange earnings. At present they are insufficient even to ease balance of payments difficulties. That is why the government has been dependent on foreign loans and grants. With Sri Lanka graduating to a low level middle income status concessionary loans are not forthcoming. Hence, the recourse to commercial borrowings at relatively higher costs. It is an unwholesome practice. Hence, the significance of the export-promotion strategy.
However, it is easily said than done. Exports could be increased only as a result of undertaking development projects which require a large infusion of capital and technology which has to be sought overseas. Thus foreign investments as well as foreign collaboration become a sine qua non of development.
However, Sri Lanka has been unable to attract sufficient foreign investments so far. Total foreign investments in 2015 were less than one percent of the GDP. Besides, it is a moot point whether even the meagre investments that came were utilized productively or spent on consumption.
Though we pursue an export oriented policy of development, the low level of productivity makes our commodities less competitive in the world market. Hence, the benefits of export promotion are hard to obtain. This necessitates the development of technology for which scant attention has been paid so far. Our expenditure on Research and Development (R & D) are insignificant and is one of the lowest, if not the lowest in the region.
Another alarming situation in the economy is the shortage of labour both skilled as well as unskilled. As a result it has become imperative to import labour despite the prevalence of considerable unemployment in the country. This factor is often forgotten or unknown to many who oppose immigrant labour on principle.
Developing countries
Besides these economic factors there are other factors, especially political that has driven the country to a precipice. Main among them is the inability to ensure national reconciliation and durable peace in the country. The wounds of a three-decade old fratricidal war have not been healed. In addition racist forces are on the offensive due to the lethargy and indifference of the Government and progressive forces. This endangers political stability which in turn deters the flow of foreign capital investments necessary for development. Hence, communalism is a self-destructive course even for its adherents. The estrangement of the different national communities and its escalation has the potential of the country degenerating into civil strife which would inevitably lead to the curtailment of democratic freedoms won and the development of authoritarian tendencies.
To make matters worse international economic and political situation is also less conducive to the development of developing countries such as ours. Difficulties faced by economies of metropolitan countries affect those in the periphery. Brexit, escalation of conflicts in the Middle East, likely surge in oil price all would have adverse reactions on our economy.
As a result cost of living will escalate and life would be terrible for the masses. Only the rich and the super-rich would be able to withstand the growing inflation.
In this dire situation politicians of almost all hues are merrily fighting over petty issues taking the people as hostages in their bid to maintain or regain political power. At a time when concerted efforts and synergies are necessary to pull the country out of the precipice internal feuds in the consensus Government is a major drawback to progress.
Political parties
Whatever the star rating that politicians may attach to the status of democracy that exists within and outside their political parties anarchism is gaining ground day by day. Protests which normally emerge on legitimate grounds have proliferated to such an extent that entirely harmful demands such as the removal of safe traffic regulations and implementation of vital administrative regulations have also cropped up recently.
Further, both the Government and the Opposition seem to be unaware of the gravity of the economic crisis as seen from the waste and ostentation that is still rampant. Fighting corruption and fraud seems to be replaced by shielding wrong-doers, discouraging whistle blowers and obstructing investigations.
Finally, it must be said that the blame for dragging the country to the edge of a precipice cannot be placed on the present Government. However, it is responsible for not managing the situation as warranted by the circumstances and its failure to take the people into confidence in meeting the challenge.
