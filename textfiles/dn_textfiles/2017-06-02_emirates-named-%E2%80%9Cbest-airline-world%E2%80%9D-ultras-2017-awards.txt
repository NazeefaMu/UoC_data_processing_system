 Emirates took home “Best Airline in the World” and “Best Middle Eastern Airline” at the ULTRAS 2017 Awards, as voted by the well-travelled readers of The Telegraph’s luxury travel magazine in their annual survey. Sir Tim Clark, President, Emirates airline, received the awards at the ceremony held in London.
Hosted at the iconic Savoy hotel on May 22, this year’s ceremony was attended by key members of the travel industry, well-known British personalities and notable special guest, Sarah Ferguson, the Duchess of York, accompanied by her daughters Princess Beatrice and Princess Eugenie.
The Emirates team is known for its dedication to continuously improving the travel experience of its passengers; earlier this year, Emirates was also named “Best Airline in the World” at the TripAdvisor Travellers’ Choice Awards for airlines after being the most positively reviewed airline in the industry.
Last year, Emirates also won the “World’s Best Airline” award at the 2016 Skytrax World Airline Awards.
