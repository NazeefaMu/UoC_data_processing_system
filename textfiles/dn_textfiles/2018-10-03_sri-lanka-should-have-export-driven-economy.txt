SRI LANKA SHOULD HAVE AN EXPORT  DRIVEN ECONOMY

In case of Sri Lanka, total exports per year is about USD 10. 5 billion.
Our total imports per year is about USD 19.5 billion per year.
Trade balance is USD 9 billion.
This is very big problem. We must increase our total exports.
Our main export products are the following.
Tea, apparel, rubber and rubber based products, gems, coconut based products, vegetables and fish. We have to look after our industries. Very often they are unable to compete with cheap foreign products. Some protection is essential.
We have to do a lot to attract foreign investors. Foreign investors are harassed by corrupt officers and red tape. They should be one common office to get their paperwork done quickly. We get foreign exchange from tourist industry and foreign employment. We must try to improve the tourist industry by providing a very good service to tourists. We must treat them very well and protect them from various racketeers. Our sisters working in Middle East countries bring lot of valuable foreign exchange to this country.
We spend the money they earn to buy luxury cars and to go around the world. Unfortunately we always forget the contribution these ladies make to our country. We do very little for the welfare of these female workers. Do they have any social recognition in our society?
Countries like Thailand and Vietnam are not much affected by the present global economic crisis as they fully depend on exports.
We have failed to increase our exports. We increase our imports by importing luxury cars and luxury items. We also use foreign exchange for foreign trips.
Unnecessary government expenditure has to be controlled at least for two years. High income earners and politicians should be socially conscious to help this country by not spending large amount of foreign exchange on luxury vehicles and on foreign trips.
