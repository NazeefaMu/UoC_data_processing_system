Court notices not delivered to JO members

Borella Police yesterday informed the Colombo Additional Magistrate’s Court that they were unable to hand over the notices issued by the Court to Joint Opposition members including Parliamentarian Dinesh Gunawardena as they did not turn up at the protest campaign opposite the Welikada Prisons. The protest was scheduled to take place opposite the prisons premises yesterday.
Notices were issued against nine parliamentarians in the Joint Opposition including MP Dinesh Gunawardena.
