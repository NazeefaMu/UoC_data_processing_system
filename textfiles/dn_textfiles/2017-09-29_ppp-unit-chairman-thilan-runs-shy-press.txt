PPP Unit Chairman Thilan runs shy of the Press

Chairman and acting CEO of the Public Private Partnership Unit of the Finance Ministry of Sri Lanka Thilan Wijesinghe, ran shy of the Press and wanted the media personnel to depart when he was to address the Sri Lanka Italy Business Council breakfast meeting at Hilton Residencies, last morning. The Ceylon Chamber of Commerce had invited a section of media to cover the event held under the theme ‘The Role of the National Agency for Public Private Partnership.”
Wijesinghe, a former Board of Investment Chairman, for reasons best known to him, wanted his speech not to be reported in the local press. Wijesinghe after his new appointment on earlier occasions has not been ‘Press shy’ and has spoken at several forums.
The public are keen to hear the views of the Public Private Partnership Unit of the Finance Ministry of Sri Lanka and it is disconcerting that the concerned bureaucrats are media shy and want to make their speeches behind closed doors.
