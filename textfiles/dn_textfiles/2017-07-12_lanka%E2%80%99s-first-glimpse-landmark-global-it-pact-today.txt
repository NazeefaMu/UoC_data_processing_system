Lanka’s first glimpse of landmark global IT pact today

As the landmark global Information Technology Agreement (ITA) completes its 20th anniversary, Sri Lanka is to catch its first glimpse of the ITA in Colombo today .
Two high level representatives from the World Trade Organisation (WTO) have arrived in Colombo especially to give a first-hand briefing to surging Lankan IT sector and firms, trade and policy officials, and other stakeholders on the landmark WTO ITA’s way forward for the country.
Senior Statistician-Market Access Intelligence Section of WTO, Eric Shing and Counsellor of Market Access Division of WTO, Xiaobing Tang will begin their Colombo briefings today joined by Minister of Industry and Commerce, Rishad Bathiudeen who is scheduled to launch the event in Colombo. ITA, concluded in 1996 and entered into force on 1 July 1997, aims to bring all taxes and tariff on information technology products (by signatory members) to zero.
ITA membership that was at 29 when the members first met in Singapore in 1997, has, after twenty years of its existence to-date, increased to 82.
