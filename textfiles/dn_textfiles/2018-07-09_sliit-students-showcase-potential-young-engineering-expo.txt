SLIIT Students Showcase Potential at Young Engineering Expo

The Faculty of Engineering at SLIIT will present the Young Engineering Expo 2018 for the fourth consecutive year on the 11th of July at the Faculty of Engineering, Malabe Campus. The exhibition provides budding young first year engineering undergraduates an inspiring opportunity to showcase their answers to real-world industrial problems through a wide range of innovative solutions.
Over 250 students will showcase their work numbering over 100 carefully crafted exhibits guided by Madhawa Herath and the Senior Lecturer in Charge of the 1st year, Prof. Chandana Perera. The participants attended a pre-Expo workshop which showed them how to build a robot, games to build their skills and equipped them with many other emerging technological skills.
Many industry specialists from corporate organizations take a keen interest in attending the opening to witness young talent that demonstrate great potential in conceptualizing and implementing technical solutions using theoretical knowledge. School children, undergraduate students and parents also make use of the opportunity to appreciate the innovations of the young engineers.
The Chief Guest who will grace the important opening is Prof. Lalith Gamage, Vice Chancellor and the CEO of SLIIT while the Guest of Honour is Prof. Lakshman Ratnayake, Chairman of SLIIT. The presence of the Deans of all the Faculties together with academic staff will also enrich the occasion.
“Young Engineering Expo 2018 presents the ideal platform for our first year engineering undergraduate students to showcase their understanding of actual engineering problems and conceptualizing and implementing solutions that work using the theoretical knowledge they have gained,” commented Madhawa Herath, the guide and mentor of the presenting students.
