Fitch rates Sampath Bank’s Basel III Sub Debt ‘A(lka)(EXP)’

Fitch Ratings has assigned Sampath Bank PLC’s (A+(lka)/Negative) proposed Basel III compliant subordinated debentures an expected National Long-Term Rating of ‘A(lka)(EXP)’.
The notes will total Rs 7.5 billion, mature in five years and carry fixed coupons. The notes include a non-viability clause and will qualify as regulatory Tier II capital for the bank. The bank plans to use the proceeds to strengthen its Tier II capital base and support its loan book expansion. The debentures are to be listed on the Colombo Stock Exchange.
The final rating is subject to the receipt of final documentation conforming to information already received.
Fitch rates the proposed Tier II instrument one notch below the bank’s National Long-Term Rating of ‘A+(lka)’ to reflect the notes’ subordinated status and higher loss-severity risks relative to senior unsecured instruments.
