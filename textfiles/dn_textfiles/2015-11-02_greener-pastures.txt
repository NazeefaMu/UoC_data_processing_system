GREENER PASTURES!

Looking back at the past I have doubts whether I would be able to achieve what I have done today if I follow the same footsteps. It is most likely that I would not choose music as my career. I would not even study music. I would not become a vocalist, a musician or a music director then.
His melodious voice sends listeners into a trance-like mood but ask maestro Victor Ratnayake if he would have taken the same musical route if he was 21 today and his firm "no" takes you by surprise!
"The world has changed so much today. This has taken its toll on Sri Lanka. The change is for worse rather than better. Every sector has deteriorated. This includes music, education, culture, religion, health, politics, cinema, language etc. People are after wealth and power. They would stoop to any level to get what they want. Nothing and no one is spared. No even children and infants," laments the seasoned musician whose voice crossed all boundaries of class, race and religion and had healed many souls for decades.
He notes that he was 21 years old when he ventured to Colombo, hunting for his fortune. Destiny led him to the Institute of Aesthetic Studies and then to the Ministry of Education as a music instructor.
"Looking back at the past I have doubts whether I would be able to achieve what I have done today if I follow the same footsteps. It is most likely that I would not choose music as my career. I would not even study music. I would not become a vocalist, a musician or a music director then," he said.
This means that fans would have missed out on his celebrated 'Sa' series. 'Sa' was the first solo performance by a Sri Lankan artiste. It set a trend which was followed by many contemporaries. Wouldn't this decision be unfair to music enthusiasts?
"It is a sad fact but that is how the world has turned out today. Practically everything has a price. Everything is marketed. Even sectors like the police which are appointed to stop corruption can be bribed. The easiest thing that everyone is trying to do is find a means to get into the Government side," he expressed.
Ratnayake's success formula lies in his attempt to bridge western music with the Ragadari classical music. His first song was an olde to the Buddha in 1964.
Even when he speaks, his syllables are sheer music as he recalls his cherished memories.
"We can enter our childhood environ only through lyrics now. We had plenty of free time at hand. Our parents encouraged us to explore and learn through experience. This fueled our creativity and imagination," he said while adding that it is this environment which mounded him into who he is today.
"My father, Ratnayake Veda Mahaththaya, was a well known apothecary in Kadugannawa. He sang Sinhala folk songs called 'noorthi gee'. That is where my talent comes from," said the musician whose songs cover diverse themes from love to patriotism and childhood memories.
Then if he would not choose music as his career what profession would he have gone for if he is 21 today?
"That is a tough decision. It needs much thought. I cannot decide on a specific sector at the moment. However I think I would have migrated to another country. That is because I cannot stay here to witness the harm that has been done to my motherland," he noted with regret.
Though he believes that he would leave Sri Lanka had he been in his youth, Ratnayake was quick to add that he thinks Sri Lanka is the most beautiful country in the world.
“It is truly a paradise. There is no other nation in the world which has the resources that we have here. We can venture from a humid city like Colombo to a cooler region like Nuwara Eliya within a few hours. We are surrounded by lush beaches and sand dunes. There is greenery everywhere. This could have been heaven on earth if human beings do not misuse what they have been blessed with,” he pointed out adding that there is not national policy for any sector. Therefore everything has gone havoc in the country.
“I am not saying that there is no hope. There are still a few things which remain untainted in the Sri Lanka. All these problems arose because incorrect and inappropriate things have been taught to the youth. The media is mostly to be blamed for this. The media is a powerful tool which can make as well as break a country,” he stressed.
Speaking about the latest gadgets in the modern world, Ratnayake noted that sky is the limit when it comes to advanced technology. However he states that many are misusing these devices rather than using them to uplift the music industry.
“Such devices need to be used wisely. Then only we can make full use of them. For instance some vocalists mime on stage during live performances. Who are they trying to kid? If they know the subject thoroughly they would not try to cheat the fans in such a manner,” he opined.
Romance is a universal topic for Ratnayake. He says that it is not something which can be limited to a specific age.
“Though many attribute romance with youth, practically speaking, age is not a barrier. A man’s physique is the most beautiful sight for a woman and vice versa. There are no laws or rules for romance. The primitive man as well as animals too shares romantic feelings,” he said.
“I feel content today because I have many good memories. My achievements are hard won but each of them is a bitter sweet experience.
If you asked me the same question 52 years ago when I was actually 21 years old, my answer would have been on a more positive note. But the harsh reality is that I am unable to give a reply which is like music for your ears today,” he concluded with a sigh.
