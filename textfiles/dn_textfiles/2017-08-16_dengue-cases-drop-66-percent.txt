Dengue cases drop by 66 percent

Dengue deaths and dengue patients have dropped by 66 percent within four weeks.
They will drop by another 50 percent in four weeks, Health Services acting Director General Dr. J.M.W.Jayasundara Bandara said.
Addressing the media at the Health Education Bureau in Colombo yesterday, he said all state and private media got together to fight against dengue.
According to Dr. Bandara, journalists can either save the country or destroy it.
“A new item can be distorted to communicate a wrong idea if the sub-editor puts a wrong headline. Journalists should learn journalism and practice it for the benefit of the people,” Dr. Bandara said.
A Senior Lecturer attached to Rajarata University, Dr. Manoj Fernando, said children bellow the age of seven do not know that what is shown in television is not reality.
“They think that everything telecast is real and true,” he said.
