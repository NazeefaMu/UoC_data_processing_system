Overcoming delays in corruption cases:
Special unit under AG’s dept

A special unit is to be set up under the Attorney General’s Department to take immediate action regarding corruption cases held up in the Department due to a shortage of attorneys-at-law to handle them, the Department Sources said. As a first step in this direction, a request has been made to assign a new batch of 50 attorneys-at-law to the Department, Attorney General Jayantha Jayasuriya PC said.
After recruiting this new batch of attorneys, they will be entrusted with the task of taking quick action regarding them after study, the Attorney General said.
This would help overcome the problem regarding the delay in handling corruption cases and serving indictments on them, he added.
