Grand-pop on the hoppity-hop!

Father’s Day has come and gone. Yes, and usually Grandfathers too have traditionally been on the radar when planning gifts and celebrations. And as radars go Grandees are on top of the heap, or rather the beep in this digital age. After all, grandfathers have been considered the top guns or shotguns of the family while the dads are actually pop guns in comparison.
And as usual the weeks before D-Day, meaning ‘Dad’s Day’, the cash registers have been jangling incessantly. Yes Siree, it is another day tainted by commercialism and heralded with a surfeit of marketing initiatives by calculating companies to cash in on the general emotions of all you mushy descendants out there.
The number of useless and impractical objects on display in the guise of gifts would be sure to give you a whole lot of Dad-blasted fits. Rest assured that dads and grand-dads never return their Father’s Day gifts to the exchange counter. This in no way would mean we are satisfied with the bizarre well-intentioned offerings. Rather we appear too ashamed to let anyone see what we received.
Even before I attained grand-fatherhood, I was known as the fearless, peerless baby-sitter. That is what they called me and with darn good reason too. But aren’t grandparents, people who think your children are wonderful even though they’re sure you’re not raising them right? But maintaining a successful reputation that precedes my advent into new climes is not as easy as one would imagine.
There is a snide minority that feels I spoil the kids rotten. Okay I am aware that a puddle is a small body of water that draws other small bodies wearing dry shoes into. So I don’t reprimand the grandkids when they splash through it. But I do look for some water on tap somewhere to help them clean up.
But these do not worry me as much as the sly lot who maintain that I manipulate the little ‘uns and make them do and say the most precocious things to the amazement of everyone. Sure, I concede that I have been responsible for the verbal retorts of a good many little charges who have come under my delightful influence. They learn only too well.
Still you have to mind your language particularly when the nippers are around. Because anything you say, may be repeated at the most inappropriate time. Besides, those same maledictions may be thrown at you personally by disgruntled scamps. To be fair, I have enlightened dozens of kids in the stimulating art of conversation when the only vocabulary they had going for them before was lisping, inconsequential baby talk.
Kids are totally outside the experience of certain parents who simply cannot fathom the bewildering complexity of the child mentality. In adult minds, perhaps, it is a question of spoil the child or be driven up the wall.
To say that I am a great guy with kids is an understatement and even my fiercest detractors must concede that my methods, though somewhat unorthodox, are decidedly efficacious. Spoiling brats is one thing but there must be an element of discipline that goes with indulging them.
Yet, as a grandfather, one has to administer justice to sweeping claims by aggrieved snivellers, supported by a barrage of infantile evidence. It often happens that the aggressors have their own counter claims, conducting their own defence to make them look the aggrieved. Any attempts to conduct oneself with a measure of frosty, judicial dignity become forlorn at this stage.
Besides, where on earth does one find midget-sized strait-jackets or handcuffs for tiny wrists, if justice is to be administered suitably? At times like these when the nasal whines become insufferable and the sarcastic tones infuriating, I have been obliged to instinctively flirt with some extreme methods of keeping the tykes quiet such as offering them lollipops laced with a mild soporific.
Some years ago my wife and I were babysitting the grand ones, Rex Tharindu (6), Moya (4) and Kingsley (2). Presently the clock ticked to 8.30 pm. My wife called out: “Ok children it’s beddy-bye time!” Rex Tharindu looked up and asked: “Why Mum-mum? It’s so early yet!”
Mum-mum fired her logical answer: “Your father said your bed-time is eight and now it’s eight thirty.” Moya took up the argument: “But Mum-mum you don’t have to listen to him.” Grand-mother Mum-mum now speaking firmly: “And why not?” Sharpshooter Moya returned fire : “ Because you are his mother!”
Still I must admit that I have been driven into some extremely delicate indiscretions while attempting to get one over the kids. Meaning it sometimes doesn’t pay to shoot from the lip. Kingsley, called Kingco for short, once told me: “Dada, If you buy me that toy I’ll be really good!” I almost bit my tongue after I realised what I had shot back at him: “Oh, yeah? When I was your age, I was good for nothing!”
When Kingco was about three, I was giving him a ride on my shoulders in a crowded mall. I felt a series of painful tugs on my mane! I warned him sharply: “Baby boy, if you keep pulling my hair, you will have to get off my shoulders!” I felt another tug as the voice of my tiny rider replied: “But Dada, I am just trying to get my bubble gum back!”
But Kingsley at four did push the limits of grand-parental patience during a family word game. You know, the type of diversion, a collection named from an old pencil and paper parlour game we used to play before the goggle-box came into living rooms. You pick a letter then make a list of bird, beast, fish, fruit, flower, boy’s name, girl’s name, countries and cities among others. It all went smoothly until Kingco began striving frantically to come up with a name of a flower beginning with the letter ‘F.’
Struggling for the name of a bloom he kept mouthing inconsequential bloomers that went something like: “Flick, flack, flock...” And then suddenly in complete frustration he dropped the F-Bomb which exploded in the living room with vicious volatility.
Justice was administered swiftly and fairly. He was sentenced to the corner punishment chair. He took it like a man, accepting the verdict with astonishing equanimity. But for sure he’ll make a great lawyer someday. Leaning forward from his seat of imprisonment he addressed me: “Hey Dada, if I have to sit in the corner for saying it you can at least tell me what it means!”
