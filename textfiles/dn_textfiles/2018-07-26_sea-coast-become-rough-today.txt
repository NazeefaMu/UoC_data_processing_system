Sea off coast to become rough today

The sea off the coast, extending from Puttalam to Batticaloa via Colombo and Galle, may become rough and may experience surges, particularly during the high tide, the Meteorology Department said.
This will last until today due to the effect of swell waves with 3.0 -3.5 metres in height.
Showers or thunder showers will occur in a few places in the eastern sea areas and light showers may occur in the coastal areas extending from Colombo to Matara via Galle.
Winds will be westerly or south-westerly in the coastal areas around the island and the wind speed will be 30-40 kmph.
The seas extending from Puttalam to Pottuvil via Negombo, Galle and Hambantota can be rough at times as the wind speed can increase up to 60 kmph at times.
Naval and fishing communities are requested to be vigilant in this regard.
Meanwhile, showers or thundershowers will occur in Uva and Eastern provinces and in Polonnaruwa, Mullaitivu and Vavuniya districts after 2 pm.
Several spells of showers will occur in Central, Sabaragamuwa and Western provinces and light showers will occur in Kurunegala, Galle and Matara districts.
