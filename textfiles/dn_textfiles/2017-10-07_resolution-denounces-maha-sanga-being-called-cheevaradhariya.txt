Resolution denounces Maha Sanga being called Cheevaradhariya

A resolution was agreed upon to denounce some politicians calling the Maha Sanga as Cheevaradhariya at a meeting of Buddhist monks of Sri Lanka Ramagngna Maha Nikaya of the Uva Province.
The meeting was held recently at Veheragala, Sevanagala under the patronage of Most Ven. Navimana Nalaka Thera, Uva Province Chief Sanganayake of Sri Lanka Ramagngna Nikaya.
Incumbents of temples of Ramagngna Nikaya in the Uva Province participated, including Lekakadhikari Ven. Lathpandure Vipula Badra Thera.
It was decided at the meeting to send the resolution to the Mahanayaka of Ramagngna Nikaya Most Ven.Napane Pemasiri Thera. Speaking at the meeting, Most Ven. Nalaka Thera said due to improper attitudes of some monks, the Maha Sanga has to face this situation.
On the other hand, there are 31 Mahanayake Theras and 65 Anunayake Theras in different Buddhist sects and there is no unity, the Thera said.
