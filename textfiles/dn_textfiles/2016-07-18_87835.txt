Muralitharan and  Australia bury the hatchet

 
Muthiah Muralitharan firmly believes that one must not carry grudges in life. How else does not explain the fact that the world’s highest Test wicket-taker, who endured a stormy relationship with Australian cricket throughout his career over chucking allegations, has now gone on to become a spin consultant Down Under? The 44-year-old helped the Aussies out in 2014 before a series against Pakistan and is now offering his services in the build-up to a Test series against Sri Lanka.
“I never had a problem with the Australian cricket board, players, or their people in general. It was just one or two individuals who made this accusation that I ‘throw’ the ball, and I proved them wrong. You’ve got to move on in life. If you carry grudges, you spoil your present and future. At the end of the day, I’m a professional,” Muralitharan told TOI on Saturday.
The animosity started with the legendary off-spinner being ‘called’ twice by Australian umpire Darrel Hair during the Melbourne Test in 1995-96. Later, during the tri-series, Murali ‘suffered’ again at the hands of another Aussie umpire, Ross Emerson. It led to the entire Sri Lankan team, then led by skipper Arjuna Ranatunga, rallying behind the spinner in a symbol of Asian cricket’s ‘resistance’ against cricket’s ‘western bloc’.
A few years down the line, Australian Prime Minister John Howard openly accused Muralitharan of ‘throwing’ the ball.
That the hatchet has been buried can be gauged from the fact it was Australian coach Darren Lehmann - who played in the era when Muralitharan wasn’t exactly his country’s ‘best friend’ -who keeps seeking the Lankan great’s help.
“Like most of the Australian cricketers of my era, I’ve a long relationship with him too. It’s also the media which makes the things difficult. As I said, past is past. If you think about it, you can’t go into the future,” chuckled the retired tweaker. TNN
