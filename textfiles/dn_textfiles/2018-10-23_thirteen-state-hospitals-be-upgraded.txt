Thirteen state hospitals to be upgraded

Mirigama Base Hospital is being developed at a cost of Rs. 700 million, with funding from the Chinese government. Thirteen more state hospitals will be developed with the assistance of the Chinese government, Health Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne said.
He was speaking at the opening of a new unit constructed at a cost of Rs. 80 million at the Mirigama Base Hospital.
People’s health is much more important than granting relief to manufacturers of sweetened drinks. These manufacturers asked for relief, but no relief can be given to them because people fall ill after drinking sweetened drinks and the government needs to spend large sums of money to treat them, he said.
Minister Senaratne said manufacturers should think about the people and ensure they deliver a service while doing business. People get 100 percent free health service because of the yahapalana government.
