Not just  a piece of cake

In a time and age when weddings have become unwieldy and complex, it is but natural to suppose the spotlight is on the couple’s garb or perhaps their choice of location. However, with cake boutiques burgeoning around the country, the cake has become the focal point at weddings.
Gone are the days when cakes had to be round, square or oval. There is no room for dummy cakes at weddings anymore. Wedding cakes have metamorphosed from cream-smattered blobs to works of art. Modern minimalist designs are in and quite a few brides like sugarcraft flowers on their wedding cake. Edible lace cakes have also made a big impression.
When you look at how skillfully he creates a Baptismal Cake or decorates a wedding cake you would not believe how Yohan Dhanuska Croos Pulle’s deft fingers knead, pleat and sculpt till the likes of rose petals, leaves and lace designs come alive in delectable detail.
The youth has quite a number of awards up his sleeve, the latest being the gold medal in the Challenge 2018 competition in the Special Occasion Cake Open class category held in Sydney Australia. Around 110 contestants competed at the event from countries like China, Thailand, Australia and New Zealand. Organised by the Cake Decorating Guild of New South Wales (NSW) the event proved that attractive cakes can up the ante of any gathering. Yohan’s presentation, a Baptismal Cake portraying a church and a newborn, was the center of attraction in the event category because of its originality and creativity.
“My Baptismal Cake was included in the ‘Welcome the Baby’ category. The décor is made with royal icing. The flowers and leaves at the base of the cake and the church design are made of parchment. The cake is covered by a layer of fondant. I used mainly pink and white shades with a hint of green for the rose leaves. Everything was edible. I won points for difficulty and creativity,” Yohan explained.
An old boy of Maris Stella College, Negombo, Yohan had ventured to Italy to join his parents. He has taken up studies in the Commerce stream at first but destiny lead him into the hotel trade later.
“We are allowed to decide upon our future profession in a span of five years. I studied at the Carlo Porta Hotel School in Milan. Since I chose to master the kitchen side, the first lesson I was given was on sacrifice. We have to be on the job even on holiday seasons like Christmas and the New Year when everyone else is off and enjoying the holiday spirit. I trained on the Hot Kitchen category for three years. We had a three month’s break. I came to Sri Lanka during that time and followed R L Clement’s PME Professional Diploma course. I started making cakes when I was 19,” he said.
One of the words of wisdom that Clement has given the youth was to take part in international cake decorating competitions. He had said that this will not only give him recognition but will hone his talents as well.
“He stressed that certificates alone will not take you far in this sector. The first competition I took part in is Malmee 2011. I won the Best in the Show and the Gold Medal,” he said adding that he had presented a wedding cake and a novelty cake at the event. The wedding cake structure won him the Best in the Show award.
Cake International: The Sugarcraft, Cake Decorating and Baking Show 2013 was his first international competition. It was held in Birmingham, Italy. Yohan won a Silver Medal in the wedding cake category for his structure on the sea theme and a merit certificate for the Shoe and Handbag category at the event. He took part in Cake International: The Sugarcraft, Cake Decorating and Baking Show 2014 in London, UK, the following year. He presented a wedding cake structure and an anniversary cake structure for the event and won a Silver Medal and a Bronze Medal for his work. In 2015 he presented a wedding cake structure for the Sugar festival held in Milan, Italy, and clinched a Gold Medal as well as the Best in the Show trophy, competing with around 250 cake structures.
After handling the dessert side in a restaurant chain in Italy Yohan returned to Sri Lanka in 2015. He joined The Grand Hotel, Nuwara Eliya, in 2016 as their cake decorator.
Yohan had originally planned to present a cake for the wedding cake category of the Challenge 2018 competition as well. However he had been short of time since he had to fulfill his employment duties while preparing for the event. Therefore he dropped out of the wedding cake category and focused purely on the Special Occasion Cake.
“I was the contestant who had travelled the most distance to take part in Challenge 2018. I made the cake in Sri Lanka and then took it to Australia and decorated it there. The judges come to review your work while we are setting up our structure. They question us if they have any doubts. I lost some points during the Cake International: The Sugar craft, Cake Decorating and Baking Show 2014 because I had used a pin for my base in my creation when we were asked to use purely edible products,” he recalled.
Yohan says that the most challenging thing about cake decorating is dealing with royal icing decorations because they are very fragile.
“If you do not handle them carefully they are likely to get damaged even before you place them on the cake. You need to look into other factors like the room temperature when you decorate a cake. I am still a novice in the field so I seek Clement’s expertise when I decide to take part in a competition. I explain my ideas to him and he adds more inspiration to it. He actually advised me to make a structure of a church with a baby for the Baptismal Cake,” Yohan said adding that you need a lot of patience when you deal with Royal Icing.
A cake will last about three or four days outdoors in Sri Lanka while it can be kept in a hot cupboard for a longer span.
“One of the most common misconceptions about a cake structure is that if it is tall, it is a good product. I too was misled about this idea till I began training in the field. There is much more to a quality cake structure than its height and width. You need to look into details like the shading on a flower and how close to reality it is to decide on its quality,” he expressed.
Out of all his cake structures the wedding cake he has done according to the sea theme is his favourite. He says that he also likes the Baptismal Cake which won him his latest award. He also admired a cake which displayed two themes while it rotated while it was on display at International: The Sugarcraft, Cake Decorating and Baking Show 2014.
Yohan is currently employed at the Sri Lanka Catering Services at the Bandaranaike International Airport. He handles the pasty section for the company. His father, Ivan Royeston Croos Pulle, is an Ayurvedic doctor. His mother is Milani Croos Pulle. His wife, Hasara Fernando, is an English teacher.
His next goal is to master the Isomalt technique and introduce it to the Sri Lankan bake enthusiasts.
“It is always better to seek the advice of a more experienced person rather than depending on your own knowledge. This will help you to enhance your ideas and better yourself,” he concluded with a smile.
