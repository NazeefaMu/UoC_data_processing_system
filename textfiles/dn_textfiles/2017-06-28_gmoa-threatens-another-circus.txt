GMOA threatens another circus

The Government Medical Officers’ Association (GMOA) is yet to receive the amended statement from the Presidential Secretariat as promised and the date for another islandwide strike will be fixed in the next few days, GMOA Secretary Dr. Haritha Aluthge said.
Addressing a press conference held at the GMOA headquarters in Colombo yesterday he said that the Executive Committee of the GMOA will meet next Thursday (29th) and make a decisive decision.
“No matter what Cabinet papers bring in, the country cannot be fooled.
The law cannot take effect for something that is inherently fraudulent” he said. GMOA Assistant Secretary Dr. Navin De Zoysa said the GMOA asks Police Media Spokesman what happened to SAITM’s former CEO who shot himself.
The GMOA will produce a report on the brutal attack launched by the police on unarmed state university students who came to the Health Ministry,he said.
Similar to the Rathupaswala attack, the attackers will be punished one day because the politicians come and go but public servants stay.They will be answerable one day, when a commission is appointed to probe the incident.
