Operation of LG bodies postponed for three months

Local Government and Provincial Councils Minister Faiszer Musthapha issuing an Extra ordinary Gazette on Friday has postponed the operation of Local Government bodies for a further period of three months.
The Government on April 7 gazetted the number of members in each local government body, the number of members to be elected from Proportional Representation (PR) system and the number of female representatives in each of them as per the new electoral system. This was done after the onerous task of delimitation which dragged on for months due to errors made in the initial report of the delimitation committee.
The order made on April 7 was to come into operation from July 1. However, as the Local Government Elections have been delayed, the Ministry has issued another Extra Ordinary Gazette last Friday postponing the order till October 1.
Local Government and Provincial Councils Ministry Secretary Kamal Padmasiri said the Order would have to be extended again if LG elections were not conducted by October 1.
The period of 335 Local Government bodies (23 Municipal Councils, 41 Urban Councils and 271 Pradeshiya Sabhas) has expired and they have been placed under special commissioners until the long overdue elections are held.
