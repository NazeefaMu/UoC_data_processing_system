Taste  of Christmas  at Barista

Colombo’s favourite coffee house chain Barista is busy putting together an array of Christmas goodies for the season. On the top of the list is a signature beverage designed by the brew masters at Barista using authentic Sri Lankan coffee. The “Kiri Kopi” is a distinct twist on a Sri Lankan favourite.
Barista’s sister establishment, the Colombo Coffee Company has for more than a decade been involved in the Toscana Ceylon Project that works to enhance the livelihoods of Sri Lankan coffee farmers. Toscana Ceylon Coffee is 100 per cent grown and processed in Sri Lanka by coffee farmers and their families. This year every purchase of the “Kiri Kopi” will ensure that 100 rupees is allocated to a fund that will purchase gifts for coffee farmers and their families, and school supplies for children of these families for the season. The gift packs with be purchased from another recognized charity, the Foundation of Goodness (FoG).
The special Christmas menu at Barista outlets will also include a range of new beverages like a Ho Ho Ho-t Chocolate, a Jingle Latte and a Christmas Frappe to tingle those taste buds.
Barista’s also got mouthwatering Honey Ham and Bacon Sandwiches, a Turkey Club Sandwich, Turkey and Cranberry Sandwiches, and even a Cranberry and Almond Pudding to put everyone in the Christmas spirit with every bite.
The Christmas specials will be available at all Barista outlets and the signature Caramel Pumpkin café throughout December.
