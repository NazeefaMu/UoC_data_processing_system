President orders 100% tax on imported Big onions

President Maithripala Sirisena yesterday instructed the Finance Ministry to impose a 100 percent tax on imported big onions.
The instructions were given after considering the difficulties faced by local onion farmers when selling their products.
In accordance with the President’s instructions the tax on imported big onions will be increased in the near future, the President’s Media Unit release further said.
The Finance Ministry recently said the government increases import taxes of some chosen products from time to time to help local producers.
