Kandy SC bounce back to beat Army 34-10

Kandy Sports Club bounced back quickly from their shock defeat at the hands of Air Force SC last week to record a fine 34 points (5 tries, 3 conversions, 1 penalty) to 10 (1 try, 1 conversion, 1 penalty) win against a somewhat off colour Army SC outfit in their Dialog ‘A’ division
Inter-club first round rugby fixture played at Racecourse International Stadium yesterday. The winners led 24-3 at lemons.
Kandy started off brilliantly, racing to a score of 24-3 with a four-try blitz in the first half. But Army got their act together and did well to comeback in the second half with an improved performance.
Kandy centre Kanchana Ramanayaka was the first to score a try when he took the ball over the line after off a beautiful three quarter move. Kandy opened out the game and played to a good pace and earned more first half
tries through number eight Buwaneka Udangamuwa and winger Richard Dharmapala who touched down two tries with his clever foot work. Fly half Arshad Jamaldeen slotted in two conversions out of the four tries they scored.
Army bridged the gap with a penalty fired across by their full back Shanaka Kumara, before the teams went in for half time at 24-3 with Kandy in the lead. The game lost its momentum in the second half as both teams produced a
half-hearted attempt - most of the time Army was guilty of dropping the ball at crucial stages of the game due to heavy rain and the ball was difficult to handle because of wet conditions.
After the turn around in the 53rd minute Kandy fly half Jamaldeen put over a 35-metre penalty to increase the lead to 27-3.
Army caught up with a try by their third row forward Silva in the 62nd minute, which was converted by Shanaka Kumara to made the score 27-10 in favour of Kandy.
Both Army and the visitors had plenty of chances of breaching the line, but their moves lacked the finishing touches, despite getting so many over laps.. In the 73rd minute fly half Arshad Jamaldeen who shifted to centre, sealed the game for Kandy when he went over the line for a try off a three quarter move. Full back Thilina Wijesinghe slotted in the conversion to give Kandy a superb win.

For the winners fly half Ashan Bandara scored the solitary try while centre Charith Seneviratne made the conversion and slotted in five penalties while for the losers a penalty try and try was scored. The conversion was fired across by full back Rajitha Sansoni.
