Census on Trinco deer population

A census to determine the deer population in the Trincomalee Fort area was conducted by officials of the Wildlife Department along with the Army, Police, Civil Defence Force, GA’s office and the Trincomalee Divisional Secretariat office.
“The purpose of this census is to get accurate information on the growth rates of the deer population around this area to determine if there is growth or a decline. This census will give us an exact number of every type of deer, including males, females, pregnant animals, and fawns,” said research conductor W. A. Lalithkumara.
“The census report will be published within two weeks. Another census had to be carried out before the launch to confirm the accuracy,” he said.
“Free-roaming deer are hard to find, which makes this area a popular tourist attraction,” said GA N.A.A. Pushpakumara who participated in this census.
“We found 520 deer when conducting this census. But we cannot give 100 percent accuracy to this number without conducting another census. After doing so, we plan to take long-term measures to conserve this deer population,” said Anura Bandara, Chairman of the Gonatata Environment Organization.
