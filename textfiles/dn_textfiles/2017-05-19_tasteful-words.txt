Tasteful words

A student has been diagnosed with a condition that causes her to taste different food every time she hears certain words.
Kathryn Jackson, 22, tastes carrots when she hears the name “Rory” and stuffing every time someone says “impossible”.
The 22-year-old, from Nottingham, has an extremely rare condition called lexical-gustatory synaesthesia. Spoken or written language causes sufferers to experience a robust smell and taste of items they associate the word with.
As a result Kathryn is distracted by her ever-changing taste buds during every conversation she has.
Other words cause her to taste or smell foods including marshmallows, apples and custard.
The student not only tastes the flavour but can also feel its textures and smell its scent.
She said: “I can taste words when I hear or see them. Sometimes a word sounds like a food item, which can trigger me to taste it.
“So for example when I hear the name ‘Lola’ I can taste lollypops.
“The name Ella makes me taste jelly beans because ‘Ella’ and ‘jella’ rhyme.
“My friend Rory’s name makes me taste carrots, because it sounds like ‘raw’ which makes me think of carrots.”
Synaesthesia is a common condition in which many people associate certain numbers and letters with colours.
But lexical-gustatory synaesthesia is a rare form of it. Mirror
