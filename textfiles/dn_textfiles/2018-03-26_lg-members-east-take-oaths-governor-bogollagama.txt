LG members in East take oaths before Governor Bogollagama

Serving the masses should be prime objective of new members of the local government and they should work with sincerity for the upliftment of the people, solving their problems, said Eastern Province Governor Rohitha Bogollagama, addressing the new local government members, who were all of the National Congress.
“We are always helpful to you, whenever you approach us. Corruption and malpractice should never be allowed under any circumstance,” he said. The Governor was the chief guest at the oath-taking ceremony of the newly elected LG members of Akkaraipattu Municipal Council and the Akkaraipattu, Addalaichenai, Pottuvil, Kalmunai and Mutur Pradeshiya Sabhas elected from the National Congress. The ceremony was held at Akkaraipattu Athaullah Arangam under the patronage of the Leader of the National Congress and former minister A.L.M. Athaullah where National Congress’s supporters were present in large numbers.
The Governor detailed the duties of the newly elected members and said that his government of ‘good governance’ headed by the President of Sri Lanka is all out to build a united Sri Lanka and the President is trying his best to maintain a cordial relationship with other countries. Now that President Maithripala Sirisena is in Pakistan on the invitation of Pakistani Prime Minister Shahid Khaqan Abbasi, bilateral talks are benefiting our countries. So it’s our duty to maintain our country’s reputation and image.
He also said, “We are ever ready to help you. Your former minister Athaullah is a good friend of mine and was a close associate in Parliament. So you all can make use of his talents and capabilities for the welfare of the area.. At trhe conclusion of the ceremony, newly appointed Mayor of Akkaraipattu Alathullah Ahaamed Zacky honoured Governor Bogollagama by draping him with golden shawl. National Congress’s Propoganda Secretary M.M. Baheej and several party officials were also present. It may be noted that Akkaraipattu Municipal Council and Akkaraipattu Pradeshiya Sabha were the only two LG bodies which had announced their Mayor and Chairman and their deputies as these two bodies registered an overwhelming victory, capturing all the wards contested by Athaullah’s National Congress Party.
