No Confidence Motion against Rajitha included  in Parliament Order Book

The No-Confidence Motion (NCM) against Health, Nutrition and Indigenous Medicine Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne has been included in the Order Book of Parliament as a motion for which no date has been fixed.
The Joint Opposition group handed over the NCM to Speaker Karu Jayasuriya on August 24. The eleven-point NCM has been signed by 39 JO MPs. The NCM has been published in the Addendum to the Order Book issued on Monday, and a date for the debate is to be fixed after discussing it at the Party Leaders’ Meeting chaired by the Speaker.
Leader of the House and Minister Lakshman Kiriella had reportedly raised several legal issues in the motion stating that its content indicates that it had not been drafted by professional lawyers. However, the motion has been published after receiving the Speaker’s nod.
The motion says the confidence in Dr. Senaratne’s competence to perform the functions as the Health, Nutrition and Indigenous Medicine Minister has been lost due to his recent conduct over the question on SAITM, and several allegations on financial misappropriation.
