SF says trade unions should know their limits

Minister and Field Marshal Sarath Fonseka yesterday said trade unions are in existence for the welfare of their members and they should not become the cat’s paw of politicians.
He added that these trade unions should know their limits. “If trade unions become stooges of political parties to achieve petty political objectives of overthrowing the government, such acts cannot be condoned,” he said.
Speaking at a New Year festival at Kelaniya yesterday, Minister Fonseka said he has proper understanding of the requirement of the President.
Fonseka said he was asked by the President whether he is willing to take up the post of Army Commander or Chief of Defence Staff. He added that he was not prepared to accept such positions at that time.
