GMOA threatens ‘biggest ever strike’

The Government Medical Officers’ Association (GMOA) along with 63 other trade unions will launch the biggest strike ever in the country’s history if the Government does not solve the SAITM issue by next Monday (April 3), GMOA Secretary Dr.Navin De Zoysa said.
Addressing a press conference held at the GMOA headquarters in Colombo yesterday, he said that some Cabinet Ministers are misusing their official powers to safeguard certain people and not to safeguard the patients’ right to life. When the current President held the Health Minister portfolio, he clearly and firmly expressed his stand on SAITM and it is expected that he will do the same now. “On January 8,2015 President Maithripala Sirisena promised to end bribery, corruption, malpractices, etc,” the GMOA Secretary said. “The Government, especially the Health Minister and the Higher Education Minister should take the sole responsibility for patients having to undergo various difficulties due to the strike because it is they who are responsible for failing to carry out their official duties to the letter and safeguard the lives of patients, Dr.Zoysa alleged.
GMOA Assistant Secretary Dr.Haritha Aluthge said the Sri Lanka Medical Council (SLMC) is the top Technical Committee in the country when it comes to setting the standard of medical education.
