Government notifies fuel distributors to report to work

 
The government issued an urgent notification saying that it is mandatory for all workers related to fuel distribution to report to work today since the government has issued a gazette stating that fuel distribution is an essential service, last night.
Furthermore if any worker fails to comply with this they will be terminated from service, the notice said.
Apart from this, all fuel bowsers were ordered be dispatched to supply fuel to gas stations since the Sri Lankan Army has undertaken to distribute fuel.
