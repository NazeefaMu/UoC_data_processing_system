Mobitel launches revolutionary Digital Recharge System

Mobitel has pioneered the Digital Recharge System, a first in the country, delivering on its commitment to simplify service offerings to customers and retail partners.
Tthe Digital Recharge System serves to reinforce its credentials as the ICT leader in the telecom sector.
Currently, Pre-Paid Mobile customers are using Recharge Scratch Cards and Reloads to top up their accounts. With the Launch of Mobitel’s Digital Recharge system, retailers can use a POS machine and print their own recharge cards to issue to their customers.
This POS Machine enables the retailer to have one wallet for both recharge cards and reloads. The machine also facilitates various promotions, discount programmes and other initiatives to be conducted. Customers can even make Post-Paid bill payments through the POS machines and retail partners can print out Data and IDD Cards as needed.
The mobile nature of the POS machine, which is similar to a phone, can be easily carried on the go directly to the customer without waiting for the customer to visit the outlet itself. This will offer greater customer convenience, while providing inclusion and connectivity for all equally. Mobitel is the first mobile services operator to introduce this system in Sri Lanka.
