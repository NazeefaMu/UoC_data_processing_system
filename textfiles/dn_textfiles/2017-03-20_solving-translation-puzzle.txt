Solving a translation Puzzle

It started with an editorial query about a bag.
In Karolina Ramqvist’s novel The White City, a woman, Karin, has been left without resources after living a luxe life with her gangster husband, John, who is dead. Karin’s Swedish, middle-class family never approved of her decision to become a criminal’s housewife, so she can’t go to them for help. The “gangster family” that was supposed to have her back has turned on her. She has no one but her nursing infant, and she’s reluctant about motherhood. In the middle of a frozen Stockholm winter, Karin is being left out in the cold, figuratively and literally: the authorities are about to seize her grand suburban home. The reader meets her there, where signs of filth and decay abound. There’s no heating, no Internet. Desperate for cash, she’s selling off her luxury handbags. The doorbell rings; a prospective buyer who has seen Karin’s ad has come to have a look:
The woman nodded and said she was going on vacation and this model was so practical for travel, smiled when Dream [the baby] waved in her direction, and asked if she [Karin] was on maternity leave.
“Yes.”
She managed another smile and held out the tote. Even the lining was in good condition, the subtle pattern brought to mind the patios of expensive restaurants and white sand.
“So, are you selling any others?”
“Yeah, I’ve taken a few out. One lovely 2.55 … Chanel.”
The woman nodded. She scrutinized the bag, complimenting her on how well it had been cared for.
Though Ramqvist never tells the reader the bag’s brand or style—she rarely mentions brands at all—I was sure, when I was translating White City, that she had a specific one in mind. Perhaps knowing which bag it was would unlock something elusive about Karin’s character.
When our editor sent me notes on this draft of the translated manuscript, she flagged “tote.” She, too, wondered what kind. “Tote” doesn’t quite communicate luxury, does it? The kind that Karin would know so well? Her query made me think of the thick cotton totes printed with images of Joan Didion or publishing-house logos. Maybe it’s a duffel bag? she wondered. Something else? Check with the author.
There were a number of these kinds of editorial queries, ranging from the landscape surrounding Karin’s mansion in a wealthy suburb and the style of tracksuit worn by her ex–best friend to the types of garbage cans found around Stockholm—all of them serving as cultural guideposts.
I’d created a document and filled it with reference images so the author would have a sense of the pictures in my mind when I was translating. Many of my photos were spot on. The frozen lake rimmed with reeds? Ramqvist said that’s exactly how she pictured the lake outside Karin’s house. The tracksuit? Indeed, it was a pink Juicy Couture. These reference images bridged the gap between imagination and language, helped make sure we were all on the same page, helped us both visualize the culture, social structures, and landscape in which the novel was forged.
Henry James recommended that a novelist should “try to be one of the people on whom nothing is lost,” and I wondered, working through this puzzle, where that leaves the translator. The phrase lost in translation came to mind, and I shuddered. Translators are exegetes, but with a special responsibility to the author in that the art of literary translation turns us into writers as well. As part of my attempt to be a person on whom nothing is lost, I was focusing on the details.
I looked back at what Karin said to the buyer. So spiky. I read the mention of Chanel as a barb; our protagonist adjusting her usual mode of speech, making it intelligible to another woman who might not speak in the same high-fashion codes. If the buyer is among those who refer to the iconic flap bag as a “2.55,” Karin is subtly undermining her by clarifying that it’s “Chanel,” as though she assumes the woman wouldn’t know what she means.
But what was the bag that had caught the buyer’s eye—the kind of bag that was practical for travel, that made her think of alfresco dining and white sand? A bag big enough, as we find out later, to hold a CZ and bags of ammunition, a baby bottle and formula, pacifiers and some cash.
I was picturing a tote bag. But what kind? Though there is an inevitable gap that exists between a novel in its original language and its translation, the texture of the culture, its cryptograms, its cool, all had to transcend this. I pressed my ear to the padlock, turned the dial slowly; I listened for the soft clicks that would give it away. I cycled through brands and considered their tote bags—their exclusivity, who carried them and when. Longchamp, Michael Kors, House of Dagmar. No. Too common. Not yet proven to be timeless. Certainly not expensive enough to resell for a meaningful amount of cash.
