FINA to probe latest Russian doping claims

LONDON, FRIDAY: As Russia staged a last-ditch bid to overturn a doping ban currently barring its athletes from competing at this year's Olympic Games in Rio, swimming authorities called for “relevant evidence” following fresh allegations that Russian swimmers had also been caught up in a similar scandal.
Friday saw the International Association of Athletics Federations’ (IAAF) governing council meeting in Vienna to decide whether to readmit Russia, first banned in November after a bombshell report by a World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) independent commission that said there was state-sponsored doping and mass corruption in Russian athletics. Before that meeting started, a joint newspaper investigation by Britain's The Times and Germany's Frankfurter Allgemeine was published alleging that two men at the centre of Russian doping revelations in athletics were said to have offered to exempt the country's swimmers from drug-testing in return for an annual fee.
