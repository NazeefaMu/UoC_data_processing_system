Free medical treatment for clergy at Sri Jayawardenepura Hospital

 
The Sri Jayawardenepura General Hospital will continue to offer free medical treatment for clergy as directed by Health Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne, the Health Ministry spokesperson said.
 
According to the spokesman, Minister Senaratne ordered Hospital Chairman Dr. Athula Kahandaliyanage to continue offering medical treatment for all clergy. 
 
Accordingly, all clergy will receive  medical treatments from the hospital free of charge as before.
 
The hospital had made a management decision to halt free service due to the high cost. 
 
The hospital authorities decided to limit in-house treatment only for the clergies residing in religious institutions located around the hospital. 
 
But the decision was revered under the direction of Minister Senaratne, the spokesperson added.
