Anandian Brendon Kuruppu broke a world record on debut

Greatness was firmly trust upon the Sri Lankan wicket keeper opener Brendon Kuruppu, although it was short lived, only for a day or two. He also became only the third person to score a double century on his Test debut, against New Zealand with Richard Hadlee and Co at the CCC in Colombo. Kuruppu did it the hard way too, his 777-minute innings was the slowest double hundred in first-class cricket history then. This was quite out of character for a man who later made his reputation as a one-day slogger. It was also his first, first-class century and to cap it all his last Test century as well.
This dashing right-hander with a ram rod straight back lift used to strike the ball at will through the arc between mid-off and mid-on. In spite of all his inborn talent both in front and back of the stumps, Kuruppu only played four Tests, two of them in England in 1988 and 1991.
With the end of the first test, in the New Zealand series, the bomb blast at the Pettah bus stand sent the New Zealander’s scurrying back home with two more tests to be played.This incident occurred, when a powerful bomb containing 25 kilograms of gelignite had been planted inside a secret compartment of a red Ford Escort car that was parked in front of one of the eight shops on the ground floor of the Central Bus Stand building.
It was an era where there was not only a dearth in Test cricket for Sri Lanka. Peace and calm was also not the order and as a result not many Test matches were played in the country.
Kuruppu in his four Test match career spanning 7 innings gathered 320 runs at an average of 53.33. Due to his aggressive approach, he was an automatic choice for the 1983 and 1987 World Cups held in England and, India and Pakistan.
In his 54 ODI’s, Kuruppu scored over 1022 runs with the highest of 72. He made his Test debut at the CCC grounds against New Zealand in April 1987 where he shone like a beacon. He played his last Test against England at Lord’s in 1991. He became the third player in Test cricket history to reach the double century mark on debut, the others were Pakistan’s Hanif Mohammed and England’s Len Hutton.
Kuruppu also created another record in that Test, being with his pads on throughout, as he was the wicket-keeper of the side.
In his marathon innings, his opening partner was Roshan Mahanama. Kuruppu carried his bat out for 201 runs spending 777 minutes, facing 548 deliveries and reached the pickets on 24 occasions.
In this encounter, it is interesting to note that neither side considered entertainment an option and on day five; the day’s play was reduced to a formality. Wisden wrote: “Time had ceased to matter. The spectators lost interest, and not even free admission could attract them to watch as Martin Crowe and Richard Hadlee batted throughout the final day.”
Play was called off 16 overs before the stipulated time, the moment Hadlee reached his 150. He remained unbeaten on 151 (with 14 fours and 2 sixes), scored from 240 balls over 406 minutes. Almost as a contrast, Jeff Crowe’s 120 not out took up 398 balls and 609 minutes: he had 13 fours to the fence.
The other 2 Tests at Kandy and SSC were abandoned without a ball bowled due to the security situation in the country.
It is heartening to note that the security situation is quite in order in the country at present, although the other factors that affects Sri Lanka cricket is not in proper order. According to reports Sri Lanka team manager Asanka Gurusinha says former skipper Angelo Mathews is eager to be part of the One Day International squad as an all-rounder.
Mathews has had a long history of injuries and the veteran all-rounder has served more time off the field in the past 12 months than ever before in his career.
The former Sri Lanka skipper has also been ruled out of the opening Test against Pakistan with a grade one tear to his calf muscle, sustained during a training session.
However speaking to media the team manager and national selector Gurusinha said Mathews has expressed his willingness to play the all-rounder’s role in white-ball cricket.
Gurusinha also noted that Mathews’ contribution with the bat and his experience alone will merit a place in the national side and therefore the team is eager to safeguard the player.
Mathews has been solely playing as a batter in Test matches for a period of time.
In my humble opinion Mathews is as good as gold but----- why does he not click and perform to his true potential; your guess is as good as mine.
Meanwhile, the Sri Lanka team left for United Arab Emirates on Sunday to take on Pakistan on a full tour. They have a gigantic task ahead of them, with a pink ball game also thrown in. Let us all wish Dinesh Chandimal and Upul Tharanga all the very best where they have to face a rugged road ahead of them!
