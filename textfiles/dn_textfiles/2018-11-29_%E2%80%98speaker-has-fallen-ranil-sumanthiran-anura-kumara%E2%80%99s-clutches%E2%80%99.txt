‘Speaker has fallen into Ranil, Sumanthiran, Anura Kumara’s clutches’

Housing and Social Welfare Minister Wimal Weerawansa yesterday said Speaker Karu Jayasuriya has fallen into the clutches of Parliamentarians Ranil Wickremesinghe, M.A. Sumanthiran and Anura Kumara Dissanayake.
He said that Speaker Karu Jayasuriya must be day dreaming in trying to become the next Prime Minister and this dream has led him to lose his independence in Parliament.
“We cannot accept him as the Speaker of Sri Lanka’S Parliament due to his partial and biased conduct. The political meetings that should be held at Sirikotha are now being held in Parliament and There is no point in attending Sirikotha meetings in Parliament,” Weerawansa said
Addressing a press conference at Housing and Social Welfare Ministry yesterday, Minister Weerawansa added that the UNP Parliamentarian has set a record for switching from Government to Opposition and vice versa.
The Minister added that people in the country can witness whether the government has become helpless or the Speaker has become helpless in the near future.
Weerawansa added that they are ready to participate in Parliamentary sessions, if Parliamentary proceedings are conducted in a proper way.
“Former Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe has failed to collect 113 affidavits from Parliamentarians who are said to have supported him,” he said.
