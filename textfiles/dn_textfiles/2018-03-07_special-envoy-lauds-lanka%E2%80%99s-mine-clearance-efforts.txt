Special Envoy lauds Lanka’s mine clearance efforts

The Special Envoy on the Anti-Personnel Mine Ban Convention Prince Mired Raad Zaed Al- Hussein said he was very impressed by what he saw during his tour to Sri Lanka in terms of measures and efforts taken to eradicate mines from this country.
“I was very impressed with my meeting with the President on Sunday and the Minister of Rehabilitation and other officials. They have such a great sense of ownership regarding the landmine issue, while the political will is extremely evident and the Sri Lankan government is very serious in carrying out the mine clearance activities,” the Prince said, congratulating Sri Lanka on the work carried out so far to rid the country of landmines and other remnants of explosives left behind by the 30 years of war.
The Special Envoy said this during his visit to Muhamalai yesterday. He is currently on a three-day inspection tour of the country. He was accompanied by Minister D. M. Swaminathan, Jaffna Security Forces Headquarters Commander Major General Dharshana Hettiarachchi and Anti-Personnel Mine Ban Convention Implementation Support Unit (ISU) Director Juan Carlos Ruan.
“I am sure if you carry on with this fantastic approach, Sri Lanka will be successful on the landmine issue. So bravo to everybody for doing such a great job,” Prince Mired Raad Zaed Al- Hussein said.
Sri Lanka hopes to complete the clearing of all landmines and make the country a mine-free nation by 2020.
When asked about the kind of assistance the international community will render to assist Sri Lanka to achieve this goal, Prince Al- Hussein said: “with this serious approach, I am sure that all donor states that can afford to support will rally round Sri Lanka in helping them achieve their noble goal. You are ticking all the boxes correctly and I am sure there will be a lot of support coming to Sri Lanka.”
Commenting on the mine clearing target achieved by Sri Lanka, Rehabilitation, Resettlement and Prison Reforms Minister D. M. Swaminathan said, “The Special Envoy had agreed to provide his support to the efforts taken by Sri Lanka and we have to finish the demining by 2020. We cannot get any further extensions. Prince Mired Raad Zaed Al- Hussein has agreed to give us whatever assistance to fulfill this obligation.”
Initially, it was identified that approximately 2,064 sq. km was contaminated with mines and remnants of explosives. Around 640 villages were affected by mines. However, the government commenced its mine clearance activities in 2002. So far, all agencies involved in humanitarian demining have cleared 1,233.368 sq. km by the end of last December. Currently, only around 27 sq. km is left to be cleared, which the government hopes to complete by 2020.
