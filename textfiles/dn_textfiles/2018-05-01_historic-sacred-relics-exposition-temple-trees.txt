Historic Sacred Relics exposition at Temple Trees

The exposition of the Sacred Bone Relics of the Buddha brought from India and Pakistan, opened at Temple Trees on Sunday evening.
The revered Relics from Sarnath in India and Taxila Museum in Pakistan are kept for public exposition.
The opening of the public exposition of the Sacred Bone Relics of the Buddha was attended by Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe.
At the exposition at Temple Trees, the public will have the opportunity to pay homage to the Sacred Bone Relics of the Buddha enshrined at the Mulagandhakuti Vihara at Saranth in India, the Relics enshrined in the Taxila Museum in Punjab in Pakistan, Relics from a Museum in Nagarjunakondai of Madurai and the Neelagiri Relics found from Sri Lanka.
President Maithripala Sirisena, Speaker Karu Jayasuriya, Opposition Leader R. Sampanthan and other ministers and parliamentarians visited Temple Trees on Sunday evening to pay homage to the Relics.
Prime Minister addressing the media during the inauguration of the public Exposition of the Relics said as some of the Sacred Relics are preserved in India and others in Pakistan, the Relics were not exhibited together for the public before.
“Sri Lankans will not get another historical moment like this to pay homage to these Sacred Relics,” he said.
“The Relics from Taxila in Pakistan were found by Sir John Marshall of the Archaeological Survey of India. Later, the Relics were brought to Kolkata and Delhi in India. Then, Anagarika Dharmapala requested to give some Relics brought from Pakistan to the Mulagandhakuti Vihara at Saranath in India and the then Governor of India also agreed to his request,” he said.
The Premier thanked the Indian and the Pakistani governments for their support to bring the Relics to Sri Lanka.
