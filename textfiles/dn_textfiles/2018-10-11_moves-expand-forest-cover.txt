Moves to expand forest cover

The government plans to plant 20 million trees and increase the forest cover from 27 percent to 32 percent within the next three years, Mahaweli Development and Environment Deputy Minister Ajith Mannapperuma said yesterday.
He said the first tree planting campaign to achieve this target commenced from Mannar District and it will be expanded to other districts soon.
“As Sri Lanka lacks trees to produce high-quality timber, we have to spend a large amount of money to import them. We have spent Rs. 13 billion in 2016 on the import of timber and timber furniture. Plans are afoot to plant one million saplings in home gardens from which we would be able to produce high-quality timber,” he said.
Libraries and holiday resorts will be built in forests to educate the public on the value of forests, allowing people to study forest conservation as well.
