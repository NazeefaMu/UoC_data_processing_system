Umtiti heads France into World Cup Final

Saint Petersburg, Russia tuesday: Samuel Umtiti headed France into the World Cup final in Saint Petersburg on Tuesday with a 1-0 win consigning Belgium's golden generation into another disappointment.
In a World Cup replete with set piece goals a corner again proved decisive when Umtiti timed his run perfectly to meet Antoine Griezman's delivery six minutes into the second half.
France goalkeeper Hugo Lloris made a spectacular full-length save to keep the score at 0-0 at half-time in the World Cup semi-final.
Roberto Martinez's Belgium had the better of the early exchanges and would have taken the lead but for Lloris's save from Toby Alderweireld but France came back strongly towards the break.
Belgium enjoyed large amounts of possession but Umtiti's goal in the 51st minute from a corner ultimately proved the difference as 1998 champions France reached their third World Cup final.
France coach Didier Deschamps said he was delighted to reach the World Cup final and relished the opportunity to do better than at the Euro 2016 final, when France lost on home soil.
A header from Samuel Umtiti gave France victory over Belgium in Saint Petersburg.
“I am very happy for my players,” Deschamps said. “It was hard against a very good Belgium team.
“I take my hat off to my players and my staff.” France lost 1-0 to Portugal in the Stade de France in Paris in 2016. Deschamps said: “Finals have to be won because we have still not got over the one we lost two years ago. AFP
