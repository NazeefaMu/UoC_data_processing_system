Staggering numbers of menacing dengue

At present dengue has become a rising menace in Sri Lanka and reports indicate Negombo to be one of the hot spots in the epidemic. Health officials baffled by the outbreak have been forced to try every tool in the box to deal with the crisis but despite their efforts, very little change seems to be occurring on the ground. As hospitals overflow with dengue patients, poor sanitation and lack of precautions against dengue have led to hospital staff themselves being infected by the dengue menace they are trying to save the people from.
Reports indicate that around 10 doctors attached to the Negombo General Hospital were diagnosed with dengue but the Negombo District General Hospital Director, Dr. Nilanthi Pathirana refused to confirm the exact numbers.
“I am aware that some of the doctors have been diagnosed with dengue but I do not know the exact number and how they got it. I have no idea whether they got it from inside or out,” she said.
An official attached to the hospital who wished to remain anonymous pointed out many places in the hospital that remained unclean. The hospital premises was filled with patients and visitors and many corners are yet to be cleaned.
“PHI’s and MOH often visit the hospital but who cares about all these. The cleaning has been outsourced to a private company and they are not performing their duties very well,” he said.
When contacted by the Daily News, Chief Medical Health Officer of Negombo Dr L.I. Ranasinghe refused to make a comment. He said he needs to get permission from the higher officials to talk to the media.
Negombo General Hospital – number of patients on the rise
The hospitals are witnessing a significant rise in dengue patients over the past couple of months. The Negombo hospital in the meantime, is also struggling to cope with the dengue crisis as a serious shortage of staff, beds and equipment continues to hinder their ability to deal with the lengthening queues of patients.
Dr. Pathirana said there were around 600 dengue patients admitted to the hospital but they only had 369 beds.
She added that the hospital was in need of more beds and staff to control the increasing number of dengue patients at the hospital. She added that the number of beds to serve dengue patients have been increased to 369. There are around 580 beds in total but the number of patients are estimated to be 900. Those without a bed have taken to sleeping on the floor and on mattresses.
“I don’t know when this is going to end because the number keeps increasing. Around 150 dengue patients are admitted everyday,” she said.
Dr. Pathirana said that they managed to increase the number of wards which was an issue, but they had managed to resolve that issue, however, they still needed more beds.
“The army has built two temporary huts to be used as wards but they are built using met roofs. So we need to provide patients' coolers and fans and we need more beds to be put there as well. We will be getting another 80 beds towards the end of this week. But, we also should make arrangements to buy coolers and fans, or we will not be able to admit the patients to those wards,” she said.
She further said that when President Maithripala Sirisena visited the hospital, there were only 400 dengue patients, but now it had increased to 600.
“The Tri forces sent nurses, medical assistants and minor staff while the Ministry of Health also sent Medical laboratory assistants, public health officers, doctors and nurses to assist the hospital to control the crisis. Moreover, 30 nurses were recruited on permanent basis recently and there are 245 doctors attached to the hospital on a permanent basis.
To control the dengue crisis, 36 new doctors have been recruited on a temporary basis,” she said.
Dr. Pathirana pointed out that since last November, the number of dengue patients admitted to the hospital had been increasing. Usually, the number reduces during March and April, but this time it has shown no decline.
“I think the mosquito density is high now, and it’s the type 2. Therefore more people would be affected as this is the first time they are being infected by it. There is no difference in the treatment, it is the same. We have established a new dengue high dependency unit and only the patients who are in serious condition are being treated,” she said.
As the numbers of patients increase, the hospital has opened screening centres. There is a fever corner at the OPD and there is another centre run by the Army nearby. Dr. Pathirana added that the patients would be admitted only if their platelet counts were very low. If numbers are not too low, they will be given necessary instructions and sent home, said the Director.
“Around 200 patients are being sent home every day after screen testing, though they were diagnosed with dengue fever. We don’t have space to accommodate all of them. We give them all necessary instructions and advice on how to take care of themselves at home,” she said.
Dr. Pathirana further said that even normal hospitals can take care of the dengue patients. They need not be sent to big hospitals, the treatment would be the same. A general physician can handled the situation; there is no need to panic.
Only awareness is not sufficient to change reality
There have been 10 deaths reported since January this year and patients were from different parts of the country, she said.
Dr. Pathirana affirmed that measures to tackle this dengue crisis were taken very late by the Dengue Control unit.
“If they had started it at the proper time we could have reduced the number of patients affected. Even the Dengue Control Unit has its constraints, so can’t blame them as well. We as doctors are here to treat the patients; it is not our duty to prevent transmission,” she said.
Director, National Dengue Control Unit Dr. Hasitha Tissera told the media yesterday that only awareness was not sufficient to tackle the crisis.
He said a research that was done recently revealed that not many people living in the Colombo areas take initiatives to remove mosquito breeding places.
“We live in a self centred community. The environment is equally important when it comes to dengue. The more polluted the environment is, the more dengue breeding sites it will have. The community should also take responsibility for the problem. The public should clean their surroundings regularly at least on a weekly basis,” he said.
K. Heshani a resident from Negombo said the PHI cames often to check their houses.
“PHIs come often to check the premises but the number of dengue patients keep increasing. So even we do not know what’s happening,” she said.
Consultant Physician, Dr. Ananda Wijewickrama advised the people not to take health matters into their own hands and to seek proper professional medical assistance when the first symptoms of dengue appear.
“The patients need to be monitored when the platelet count is less than 100,000. If the patient’s platelet count is more than 100,000, we send them home.
The patient needs bed rest, adequate amount of liquid intake and paracetamol for the fever.
The reason why we are sending the patients home is not because of the numbers. The patients have to come back and check their blood counts either the same day or the next day,” he said.
Dengue a man-made disease
Former national coordinator for Dengue control Dr. Lakshmi de Silva
Outbreaks are directly proportional to the Dengue mosquito density. Although mosquitoes cannot be eliminated, if the mosquito density is kept low dengue outbreaks can be controlled. One of the most effective strategies for this is to eliminate the dengue breeding sites. To achieve this, active community involvement is essential. Continuous public awareness programmes need to be conducted to ensure active community involvement. Clear, uniform messages need to be given to the public.
Health Department alone cannot control dengue. Inter- sectoral involvement is an important factor in dengue control activities. Other relevant departments like Local Government, Environment Authority, Education Ministry etc. should all be involved in planned control activities. The Education Ministry can play an important role in changing the behaviour of school children. Children should get involved in keeping the school premises and their home surrounding free of dengue breeding sites. As there is a shortage of field staff, volunteers can be trained to inspect premises and disseminate health education messages in identified high risk Grama Niladari divisions. In addition, other field officers like Samurdhi officers, environmental officers, agricultural officers etc. can also be trained and used in field control activities.
Although fogging can be done to reduce the adult mosquito density in an epidemic situation, this should not be done indiscriminately. When a patient is notified, fogging should never be limited to that household alone.
This will cause dissemination of infected mosquitoes to the surrounding households. Fogging should be done according to the given guidelines. It is more important to identify and remove the breeding sites.We must also remember that the use of insecticides will also reduce the density of other important slow flying insects. It is also a health hazard to humans.
The most important aspect is to plan and implement dengue control programmes throughout the year and to intensify selected activities prior to the expected outbreak months.
It is very important and also cost effective to prevent an epidemic rather than control an epidemic once it has occurred.
