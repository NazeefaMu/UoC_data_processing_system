Abductions in Colombo during 2009: ex-Navy Intelligence chief to be arrested

Lt.Commander too to be taken in:
The CID conducting investigations into an incident where several persons had been abducted by unidentified groups in Colombo and the surrounding areas in 2009 informed Court yesterday that former Navy Intelligence Director Rear Admiral Ananda Guruge is to be arrested over the disappearance of two individuals in Kotahena. The OIC of the CID’s Gang Robbery Unit-Inspector Nishantha Silva informed Court that former Navy Intelligence Director Ananda Guruge  and Lieutenant Commander Sampath Dayananda, a former Navy intelligence officer attached to the Welisara Navy camp would be arrested soon regarding the investigations on the abductions and disappearances of Vadivelu Pakkili Sami Loganathan and Rathnasami Paramanandan.
Meanwhile, Lieutenant Commander Dhammika Anil Mapa, a Navy Intelligence officer attached to the Welisara Navy camp arrested for allegedly abducting Vadivelu Pakkili Sami Loganathan on November 1, 2009 was yesterday ordered to be further remanded till by Colombo Additional Magistrate J. Trotsky.
Inspector Nishantha Silva informed Court that the van of Vadivelu Pakkili Sami Loganathan was found at the Welisara Navy Camp while being discarded and cut into 72 pieces.
However, President’s Counsel Anil Silva appearing for the suspect denied allegations leveled against his client but admitted the fact that the Navy Intelligence Unit had taken the concerned vehicle into their custody following a report that it contained bomb concealed and compelled to cut into pieces for the purpose of searching explosive substances.
The CID submitted to Court that there is no legal provision vested with the Navy to carry out such a step and informed Court that the Navy should have brought the matter to the attention of police and bomb disposal unit.
Meanwhile, the Additional Magistrate yesterday permitted the CID to record a statement from former Senior DIG Anura Senanayake in connection with two abductions that took place in 2009.
It is alleged the former Senior DIG covered up evidence into an incident in which two persons had been abducted by an unidentified group from the Kotahena and Wellawatte areas in 2009.
The Additional Magistrate ordered the Superintendent of the Welikada Prison – in which the former Senior DIG is being held over the killing of ruggerite Wasim Thajudeen – to allow the CID access to him to record a statement.
The Colombo Crimes Division initiated investigations into these abductions on the instructions of the IGP following a complaint by then Navy Commander Wasantha Karannagoda in 2009.
The CID also informed the court that 11 abducted individuals had been detained at the Trincomalee underground detention centre violating their basic human rights.
