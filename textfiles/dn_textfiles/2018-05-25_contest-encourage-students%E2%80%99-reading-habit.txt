Contest to encourage students’ reading habit

Moves are underway to offer medals to the students who read the most, with the aim of inculcating the reading habit among students, Education Minister Akila Viraj Kariyawasam said.
The Minister said that three medals - Silver, Gold and Platinum - will be awarded to such students in the future. Students between the ages of 5 and 19 are eligible to take part in the contest.
“Student who reads 50 books will receive the Silver medal, those who read 75 books will receive the Gold medal and those who read 100 books would receive the Platinum medal,” he said.
Prior to introducing the reading competition, the Education Ministry took several measures to set up school libraries. Accordingly, the Ministry allocated Rs. 700 million last year to purchase books.
A significant allocation will be made this year too, the Minister added.
Besides awarding medals it has been proposed to offer a foreign education tour for the students who read the most, the Minister further said.
