Indian Army Chief of Staff honours fallen war heroes at IPKF Memorial

Indian Army Chief of Staff General Bipin Rawat, who is currently in the island on a week-long (May 13 to 18) goodwill visit at the invitation of his Sri Lankan counterpart, began his first day itinerary by saluting memories of fallen Indian Peace Keeping Force (IPKF) war heroes at the Battaramulla IPKF monument, yesterday morning.
At the IPKF memorial premises, Sri Lanka Army Deputy Chief of Staff Major General Ajith Kariyakarawana along with Military Police troops, received the visiting Indian Army Chief of Staff.
Amid honours presented by the Military Police, General Bipin Rawat placed a floral wreath at the IPKF memorial and saluted his fellow Indian soldiers who had laid their lives in Sri Lanka’s fight against terrorism.
The sounding of the Last Post, in keeping with military traditions and the accord of formal respect, signalled the end of the brief memorial service.
The commemorative ceremony was also attended by the Defence Advisor of the Indian High Commission in Sri Lanka and a host of senior Officers of the Sri Lanka Army.
