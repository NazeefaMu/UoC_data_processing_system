‘Politicians’ demagogic  approaches should be defeated’

People should defeat the attempts of power hungry Muslim politicians to rouse communal feelings and create clashes in their community, the Patriotic Muslims Brotherhood Organisation’s Secretary M.H.M.Rizvi said.
He said the aim of several Muslim politicians is to grab Muslim votes to strengthen the political power to carry out their business.
He said the Muslim community must be aware of the situation and join hand with Sinhala and Tamil patriots to build the motherland.
"If all the communities and religious groups want to live in amity in the country, they should feel and act like Sri Lankans forgetting pretty differences,” he said. Addressing the media in Colombo yesterday, he said Muslim leaders like T.B. Jayah, Macan Makar, Siddi Lebbe, Razixk Fareed and Alevi Moulana were noble people who respected all communities.
They never criticised others as extremist tribal politicians. Sinhala and Tamil people never called Muslim people as violent extremists in the past," Rizvi said. He said all ethnic groups were living in the country peacefully.
The situation changed with the emergence of power hungry Muslim politicians who turned politics into a business rousing communal feelings for the attraction of Muslim votes.
