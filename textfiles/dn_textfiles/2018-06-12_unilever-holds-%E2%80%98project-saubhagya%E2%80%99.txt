Unilever holds ‘Project Saubhagya’

Lauding the entrepreneurial spirit of the members of its unique Saubhagya Channel, Unilever Sri Lanka recognized the top 100 performers of Project Saubhagya at its annual Diriya Pranama Awards held at the Galle Face Hotel, recently.
Champa Upasena, Director Women’s Bureau of Sri Lanka was the Chief Guest while I.D.K. Sanjeewani Deputy Director (Social Development) - Samurdi Development Department joined in as a special guest.
Currently in its 15th year, Project Saubhagya is Unilever Sri Lanka’s key initiative under its Unilever Sustainable Living Plan pillar of providing ‘opportunities for women’ and has emerged as a symbol of women’s empowerment in the country’s rural areas. As a testament to the success of the program and the capabilities of rural women, this year’s top entrepreneur for the third consecutive year was R. N. Ranjani of the Monaragala district. Seventeen entrepreneurs were recognised for long service, having been with the program from its very inception.
“At Unilever Sri Lanka, we firmly believe that the empowerment of women is central to driving and sustaining economic development at a national level. In line with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goal of creating gender equality, Project Saubhagya is a key element of our efforts towards providing greater opportunities for women and empowering them financially. Helping improve their livelihoods, it also allows us to build stronger distribution networks and create a more sustainable business,” said Unilever Sri Lanka’s Customer Development Director, Aruna Mawilmada.
Project Saubhagya stems from a deep understanding of the difficulties faced by women in developing marketsand the integral part they play within Unilever’s own distribution network.
Going beyond supporting women through such endeavors, Unilever Sri Lanka assists them with the education of their children through the Saubhagya Scholarships Unilever Sri Lanka also finances community development projects in their villages.
