Special office to combat disasters in Uma Oya project

A Special Office will be opened on November 1 to take measures to minimize disasters during next three months in the areas affected by the Uma Oya Multipurpose Development Project, said Disaster Management Centre Director General G.L.S. Senadeera yesterday.
He stated that the institution would be opened on the First Floor of the Uva Community Radio office, Bandarawela.
He was speaking to the media at the Disaster Management Ministry Auditorium.
Senadeera also said that Cabinet approval has been granted for the setting up of this institution in coordination with the National Building Research Organization (NBRO), Central Engineering Consultancy Bureau, Geological Survey and Mines Bureau (GSMB), the Geology Department of Peradeniya University , under the supervision of the Disaster Management Centre.
Senadeera added that three experts from each institution would join together to take decisions to be implemented during a three month period, to minimize disasters in the area. He also added that the institution will be established for a period of three months and be extended if required.
Uma Oya Multipurpose Development Project - Project Director Dr.Sunil de Silva said the leakage at the Uma Oya Project could be minimised by the end of January, since the measures that have already been taken have proved successful.
He added that an unexpected leakage of 1400 litres of water, per second, has been reduced to about 400 litres per second.
Senadeera added that quick remedial measures taken on the instructions of President Maithripala Sirisena with experts brought from Norway and Switzerland proving to be a success.
“However, there’s another 5 km long tunnel that has to be built and the time frame cannot be predicted as the progress is a little bit slow due to the new mechanism,” Dr.Silva said. “The water table is rising with grouting the leakages and the water levels in the wells would come back to normal when the leakage is brought to Zero, soon.” Disaster Management Ministry Secretary Kingsley Rodrigo was also present.
