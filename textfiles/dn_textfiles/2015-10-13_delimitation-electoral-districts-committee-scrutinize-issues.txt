Delimitation of electoral districts: Committee to scrutinize issues

Provincial Councils and Local Government Minister Faizer Mustapha will appoint a committee to look in to the issues and complaints with regard to the delimitation of electoral districts, Elections Commissioner Mahinda Deshapriya told the Daily News yesterday.
Final decisions will be taken only after the report is published, he said.
The Elections Commissioner added that the delimitation committee report was published under the patronage of the President. However, there are conflicting opinions regarding this issue. President Maithripala Sirisena and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe do not intend to postpone the Local Government elections.
He said the Commissioner of Elections do not have the power to decide on the date of the election. This has to be decided by the Cabinet and the Parliament.
He said elections could be held before March 31, 2016.
