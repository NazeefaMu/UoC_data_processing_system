Serenia Residences, Thalpe to start construction in June

Serenia Residences Thalpe Galle comprising 47 fully-serviced apartments and a boutique hotel will commence construction next month and would be ready by 2019 December.
Dilshan Kodituwakku Executive Director Serenia Limited said that the total investment is Rs. 2 billion and it was raised from local borrowing. We are looking at a Return on investment in less than three years as over 40% have being already sold with most of buyers being foreigners.
“Serenia is that rare opportunity: a chance to invest in a distinctive beach location, where pristine beaches, culture, entertainment and relaxation is all at your doorstep”, he said.
“Serenia Residences offer freehold titles for Sri Lankan’s as well as foreigners, along with an attractive 8-11% USD return per annum. Unlike timeshares Serenia does not have strict occupation time periods or blackout periods and one is at liberty to live here at Serenia as long as you wish, a further advantage of being part of the exclusive Serenia family.”
“Serenia Residences is not a stereotyped beachfront apartment, but a mixed-use, resort style, fully-serviced residential project”, said Co-Founder/ Executive Director of Strategic Design & Marketing, Serenia Limited, Sabina Karunanayake.
The apartments offers designer Camagni Italian kitchens, built-in Electrolux appliances, floor-to-ceiling double glazed windows, Bohemian hand-blown crystal chandeliers, European bathroom fittings, oversized glass-enclosed rain showers, Italian homogeneous tiles, an outdoor yoga studio, an outdoor cinema, kid’s play area with day care, car wash facilities, an oceanfront deck and spacious private cabanas, beach concierge services, 24-hour attended lobby, 24-hour valet parking services and many other facilities and amenities.
“People from all over the world have picked Serenia as their investment and holiday home, and are unanimous in their appreciation of the incredibly special experiences this very special and niche area has to offer. It’s a completely unique place, and one that sells itself at a glance”, said Karunanayake.
“The many advantages of the Residential Rental Program include complete access to all Serenia’s amenities, services and marketing from a five-star hotel operator, making all residences a world-class destination everyone desires to visit and owners like to rent out,”, said Karunanayake.
