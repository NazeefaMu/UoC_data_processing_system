Arundika before FCID on meeting with Udayanga

Tourism Development and Christian Religious Affairs Deputy Minister Arundika Fernando went before the Financial Crimes Investigation Division (FCID) yesterday to make a statement about his meeting with former Ambassador to Russia Udayanga Weerathunga in Japan.
On October 20 last year, the Colombo Fort Magistrate had issued a warrant written in English through the Interpol for the arrest of Udayanga Weeratunga, a first cousin of former President Mahinda Rajapaksa over alleged financial fraud.
It is alleged to have taken place in procuring seven MiG-27 ground attack craft for the Sri Lanka Air Force.
