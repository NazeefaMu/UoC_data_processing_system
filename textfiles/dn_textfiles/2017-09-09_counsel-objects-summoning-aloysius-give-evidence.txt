Counsel objects to summoning Aloysius to give evidence

Treasury Bond issue:
President’s Counsel Gamini Marapana to represent PTL owner:
President’s Counsel Anuja Premaratne yesterday objected to summoning Perpetual Treasuries Ltd(PTL) owner Arjun Aloysius to give evidence before the Treasury Bond Commission.
Answering a question from the Commissioner Supreme Court Judge P.S. Jayawardena, Aloysius’s Counsel Premaratne PC said that he objects to Arjun Aloysius giving evidence before the commission.
Meanwhile, President’s Counsel Gamini Marapana informed the Presidential Commission of Inquiry investigating into the Treasury Bond issue that he will be representing Arjun Aloysius at the commission. Accordingly, Aloysius will be represented by both Marapana PC and Premaratne PC.
Chairman of the Commission Supreme Court Judge K. T. Chitrasiri initially informed Premaratne PC that he has to be ready with his client’s affidavit by next Monday (11).
Premaratne PC requested at least 48 hours to prepare the affidavit starting from the time when Aloysius complete giving statements to the CID officers attached to the Treasury Bond Commission. Statements were recorded from Aloysius both yesterday and day before by the CID, each day over eight hours.
Premaratne PC argued that his client is being interrogated for long hours and for days, so that they will need time to prepare the affidavit. Chairman K.T. Chitrasiri informed Premaratne PC, recording of statements will be finished by next Sunday (10) and agreed to grant 48 hours to Premaratne PC to prepare the affidavit of Aloysius.
Commissioner Chitrasiri further told Premaratne PC to prepare the affidavit on time, so that the commission could start examining Aloysius by next Tuesday, to which Premaratne PC said that they are making a submission. Justice Jayawardena: Mr. Premaratne, are you objecting to giving an affidavit or giving evidence?
Premaratne PC: I am objecting to giving evidence. JJ: Well, it is up to you.
JJ (continues): If you are reluctant to give evidence it is your choice. You have to think very carefully about it.
Later on, explaining his position, Premaratne PC told Daily News that they are questioning the compellability of his client to give evidence in a case where he is a defendant.
We will be making the submission on whether we are compellable to give evidence, Premaratne PC said.
Aloysius’s counsel is to cross examine PTL CEO Kasun Palisena next week.
