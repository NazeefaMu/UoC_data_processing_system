History’s longest blockade

In history blockades have been transient features, often associated with war. The blockade of Cuba by the United States is an exception. Imposed in 1962, it has been in existence for nearly 60 years continuously and regularly increasing in its ferocity.
It is not merely an economic blockade. It is much more comprehensive. It is a package of punitive measures in economic, political and cultural relations. To give a simple example, a Cuban child was prevented from receiving a Japanese camera as the first prize won in a competition. It was because the blockade prevents goods having a 10 percent input of US manufactured parts cannot be sent to Cuba. Even countries that deal with Cuba are penalized by the United States by seizing their bank accounts and by other measures. For that purpose, it has passed extra-territorial legislation in violation of international law. Ships reaching Cuba are barred from entering US ports. Even cultural and scientific delegations are prohibited to visit Cuba. Restrictions on travel to Cuba are regularly tightened for US citizens.
These restrictions of trade, travel and investments hurt not only the Cuban economy but also that of the United States. That is why there is a strong movement in the US for lifting the unjust blockade. The blockade prevents Cuba from obtaining even medicine for the sick.
The loss to the Cuban economy from the blockade has been estimated by United Nations officials to be US $ 130 billion.
It is intended to strangle the Cuban revolution and effect a regime change. The blockade is supplemented by overt and covert attempts at regime change, including armed aggression and electronic warfare. Accompanied with them is a media war and funding dissident groups.
Since 1992 the United Nations General Assembly has been passing a resolution calling for the ending of the blockade. It has been passed with more votes in succeeding years. Last week it was passed with two countries voting against and 192 voting for. The same resolution will be taken up for discussion and voting in early October.
Addressing the UN General Assembly this week Cuban President Miguel Diaz Canel Bermudez said that the blockade “seeks to suffocate the Cuban economy in order to generate hardships and disrupt the constitutional order. It is a cruel policy, punishing Cuban families and the entire Nation.
It is the most comprehensive and long-standing system of economic sanctions ever implemented against any country. It has been and continues to be a major obstacle to the country's development and to the realization of the aspirations to progress and well-being of several generations of Cubans”.
It is time to say once again “NO” to the US blockade of Cuba!
UK’s Labour seeks new direction in development
Jeremy Corbyn, Labour Party leader has unveiled plans for a new direction in running the economy with a Green revolution. The new policies include nationalisation, which until recently was anathema to most mainstream politicians, a drastic extension of workers’ involvement at the top of companies, a rollout of green technologies, including 13,500 onshore and offshore wind turbines, solar panels on thousands of roofs and wide-scale home insulation.
“The whole edifice of greed-is-good, deregulated financial capitalism, lauded for a generation as the only way to run a modern economy, came crashing to earth, with devastating consequences”, said Corbyn addressing the Labour Congress.
But instead of making essential changes to a broken economic system, the political and corporate establishment strained every sinew to bail out and prop up the system that led to the crash in the first place. “People in this country know – they showed that in June last year - that the old way of running things isn’t working any more”, he added.
Another new policy is to extend the government’s 30 hours of free childcare scheme to the parents of all two, three and four-year-olds, which would benefit more than a million children. Families on the lowest incomes would be eligible for additional subsidised hours of the 30 hours, which would be free for them and cost no more than £4 per hour for those on the highest incomes, with a sliding scale in between.
Key policies include income tax rises for the richest five per cent of high earners, scrapping university tuition fees and the nationalising of water and energy companies, the rail network and Royal Mail.
All primary school pupils will receive free school meals and class sizes will be reduced to “less than 30” for five, six and seven-year-olds. Statutory maternity pay will increase to 12 months and paternity leave will double to four months, along with an increase in pay.
If Labour wins the next general election in Britain the neo-liberal paradigm is likely to meet with an existential threat.
