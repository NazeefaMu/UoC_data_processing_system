Doctor in hot water for forced birth control

An investigation is currently in progress on the issue where a lady doctor attached to the Dambulla Base Hospital is reported to have introduced a certain birth control methods to mothers by force, Acting Director General of Health Services, Dr. Jayasundara Bandara said.
According to Dr. Bandara, the investigation is focused on finding out whether the lady doctor forcefully introduced the birth control method (inserting a loop) into the mothers who delivered their babies, at the Dambulla Base Hospital.
Usually a birth control method cannot be forcefully introduced to a mother without her consent. According to the findings of the ongoing investigation, several mothers had received it with their consent while some mothers had opposed it,"he said.
"Usually, several birth control methods are used in Sri Lanka without any issue. Sometimes it is questionable whether all mothers in the country become mothers with or without their consent," he added.
