Fashion  with a conscience

There is greater need now in the world of fashion to redefine sustainability and to bring solutions that are relevant to the issues that the global fashion industry is facing. The Responsible Fashion Movement was set up in 2017 to do just that. It first defined the current need by identifying eight impact areas that could be the base from where the solutions will flow.
These impact areas will be the pillars of development or movement. One of the key objectives defined was that Knowledge will be converted into Action, so that through the action the solutions are visible. The Summit took place on July 4 at Shangri-la Hotel, Colombo.
The focus of the first summit broadly was the societal impact and the environmental impact, with a theme ‘A New Normal’. This was the step the industry wanted to take in Sri Lanka and show it as the shining light in region by leading this inclusive movement for the bigger good of the environment.
“This is a defining Movement for Sri Lanka, Asia and Rest of the world, as our mandate for impact is unique and is very relevant to the global issues that the fashion supply chain is facing, and Sri Lanka is perfectly placed to take the lead in the region,” says Ajai Vir Singh, Founder of The Responsible Fashion Movement.
After the successful first summit, the second Responsible Fashion Summit was framed to push the environmental causes strongly. The of the second summit was ‘Earth Sensitiv’e. The focus shifts to bring awareness and solutions to environmental issues that the global fashion industry is facing.
