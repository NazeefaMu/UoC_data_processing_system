Sylvestrians beats Richmond 30-15

St. Sylvester’s College pulled off a hard fougth 30 (1 goals, 4 tries and 1 penalty) to 15 (1 goal, 1 try and 1 penalty) win over Richmond College, Galle in their inter school ‘Bowl’ trophy rugby match played at the Bogambara Stadium last evening. Both teams played an excellent game of rugby and with great difficulty Sylvestrians led 10-8 at half time. In the first half, Sylvestrians did not perform with their usual speedy game and depended on few individuals to grab points. Richmond forwards did well but were unable to maintain consistency in their teamwork to score points from the ball they won at line outs and scrums during the latter stage of the second phase.
After the turn over it was evident that the Galle boys were determined to pose a big challenge to Kandy lads which they did in style and in the last quarter they closed the gap to 15-18 at a stage. Soon Sylvestrians bounced back strongly with a fierce attack and had bulk of possession from their forward and back division play to increase their scoring and sealed the victory.
Referee - Rangith Kumara
