Thereafter a fixed rate of 14.5% will be applicable from 3rd to 5th year and 15.5% will be applicable from 6th to 10th year.
Pan Asia Bank “Nivasa” housing loan can be obtained for multiple purposes including building a house, buying a block of land to build a house, completing, renovating or extending a partially built house, repaying an existing housing loan from a recognized financial institution.
