Out of the 11, four were serving officers (one officer released), four retired officer (two retired officers released) and three intelligence operatives (all three released), the minister said.

Marshy lands help lower Colombo temperature - Patali
The temperature in the Colombo city is five degree lower than it should have been, thanks to the network of low lying marshy
lands around Colombo, Megapolis and Western Development Minister Patali Champika Ranawaka said in Parliament yesterday.
The minister said this in response to a special statement made by DNA MP Anura Kumara Dissanayake who questioned whether steps were taken to compensate more than 2000 families affected as their lands were acquired for the Weras Ganga drain water collection project.
He said around 30 percent of lands in the Colombo district are low lying areas. Due to the haphazard reclamation of the low lying lands and unplanned urbanization, even minor rain can cause floods in Colombo. The Weras ganga project was designed to solve this, minister Ranawaka said.
Twenty acres of fallow paddy lands in Papiliyana and 30 acres paddy lands in Pillawa not cultivated for several years were again cultivated due to this project, he said.
Government democratises budget - Eran
The government democratised the budget which had been privatized by the previous regime, Public Enterprise Development Deputy Minister Eran Wickramaratne told in Parliament yesterday.
“This is the difference between the previous regime and the present government. Now, anybody can criticise the budget and make proposals as there is a government sensitive to the thoughts of the public. Being more democratic doesn’t mean that the government is weak. That is why the second reading of the budget was passed with the 2/3 majority,” he said.
Wickramaratne said the Budget 2016 will be passed with a large majority on Saturday.
Sri Lankan Air Lines has recorded a loss of Rs.128 billion which is 15 times higher than the amount allocated to Samurdhi beneficiaries. The people have to pay for the loss making institutions. Mihin Lanka has recorded a loss of Rs. 16 billion, he said.
“Protecting the capital and the depositor is the main responsibility of bankers. International rules and regulations are applied to the banks. If the term, “bank, is used with Divi Neguma, it should be under the supervision of the Central Bank. The banking system should not be politicised,” he said.
“Some Bankers engaged in a strike. But the trade unions of the UNP, SLFP or the JVP were not involved in the strike. Only one trade union was engaged in the strike. I condemned the decision taken by bank officers to hold a strike when the budget has not been passed,” Wickramaratne said.
More graduates to be recruited to govt. service
The government will recruit 5,500 graduate development officers within the next two months, Public Administration and Management Minister Ranjith Madduma Bandara told Parliament yesterday.

Public servants were provided with massive benefits this year. Salaries were increased by Rs.10,000 while pension scheme anomalies were rectified. Four hundred graduates were recruited as management trainees. Rs. 2,000 of Rs. 10,000 allowance given to the
public sector employees will be added to their basic salaries from the beginning of the next year, he said.
There will be no reduction in the pension payment. For those who join the public service from 2016, there will be a contributory pension scheme, Madduma Bandara said.

A heated argument broke out in Parliament yesterday between presiding Deputy Speaker Thilanga Sumathipala and International Trade State Minister Sujeewa Senasinghe.
The incident happened while State Minister Senasinghe was speaking at the committee stage debate of the budget proposals under the financial heads of the Industry and Commerce Ministry and Public Enterprise Development Ministry.
State Minister Senasinghe said during the previous regime, Rohitha Abeygunawardena could not make appointments to the Ports Authority without Namal’s approval to which Abeygunawardena responded and said it was untrue.

However, Abeygunawardena challenged Minister Senasinghe to table the copy.
Minister Senasinghe said he didn’t have the copy of the letter but could procure some other day.
However, Deputy Speaker Thilanga Sumathipala told the State Minister if he continued to mention the names of members often, they had to be given the chance to respond.
“You should not tell me what to speak,” State Minister Senasinghe said.
“You maintain the order of Parliament. I’ll decide what to speak,” the Deputy Speaker said.
At this stage, Deputy Speaker Sumathipala asked him to sit.
“I am on my feet why should I sit,” the State Minister said.
“I order you for the second time to sit. If you don’t do so, I will order for the third time and will force you to sit,” the Deputy Speaker said.
State Minister Senasinghe was silent. He was allowed to continue the speech.
“I request to allow me to speak. I am on my feet. I challenge the opposition in accordance with the standing orders and regulations,” State Minister Senasinghe said.
“I don’t object opposition members being permitted to respond,” he said.

Errant traders to be rounded up
Traders who continue to sell essential commodities at prices higher than those specified in the budget 2016, will be raided from this week, Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayake said yesterday.
“We have received information that certain traders are trying to create an artificial shortage of essential items without passing the benefits from the budget to consumers targeting the forthcoming festive season,” the minister said.
Addressing the media-briefing held at the Parliamentary Complex yesterday, the minister said that there is no room to create an artificial scarcity of essential items by resorting to hoarding and other malpractices due to the price decrease in essential commodities through the budget.
He said measures are in place to ensure enough essential food items in the market.
Rural Economic Development Minister P. Harrison said the Yahapalana government provided reliefs to the people by reducing the
prices of 12 essential commodities through the budget. But the people said they have not received benefits.
“That is why we want to conduct raids and nab traders who do not pass the benefit of the concessions to consumers. We have called tenders for the sale of excess rice stored at the Paddy Marketing Board for Rs. 40 a kilo. However, the rice mafia created by a few companies tried to sabotage the move. We will sell rice at Rs.42 a kilo to a foreign company and send money to the Treasury. The Cost Of Living Committee headed by Development Strategies and International Trade Minister Malik Samarawickrama will meet once a week to provide more relief to the people, minister Harrison said.
Some clauses of Prevention of Terrorism Act in Penal Code - Vijitha Herath
Measures have been taken to include some clauses of the Prevention of Terrorism Act in the Penal Code, which is ordinary law. This situation is more dangerous than the previous one, said JVP MP Vijitha Herath told in Parliament yesterday.
There was a long process to take a person into custody under the Prevention of Terrorism Act. By including these clauses in the common law, any person could be arrested easily under the ordinary law, he said.
He was joining the committee stage debate of the budget proposals 2016 for the 11th allotted day held under the financial heads of Public Administration, Industry and Commerce and Public Enterprise Development.
He proposed the government to continue paying Rs.6,000 as a monthly payment to July strikers without paying Rs.250,000 as was proposed in the Budget proposals 2016. He said the government has not provided suitable jobs for newly recruited degree holders. Though a circular with regard to this has been issued, the government failed to implement it, he said.
He said a service constitution should be in place to enable public servants to get promotion through examinations and service experience.
Tamil speakers must be recruited to upcountry areas - Radhakrishnan
Tamil speaking officers must be recruited to upcountry areas as a solution to the problems faced by them due to the language barrier, Education State Minister V. Radhakrishnan told in Parliament yesterday.
He was joining the committee stage debate of the budget proposals 2016 for the 11th allotted day held under the financial heads of Public Administration, Industry and Commerce and Public Enterprise Development.
He said up-country people have confident on the government and the Budget 2016.

solutions for people’ issues, he said.
TNA MP Thurairethnasingam said some government officers don’t understand the grievances of the people. They have to face hardships due to the language issue, he said.
Responsibilities and the work load of Grama Niladharis are increasing. The government should take measures to recruit Grama Niladharis to the areas where there are many families attached to one Grama Niladari, he said.
Radhakrishnan said Tamil speaking registrars should be recruited to avoid incorrect registrations of Births, Deaths and Marriages.
People have no confidence in budget - Mahindananda
People have no confidence in the Budget 2016. The government has presented five budgets within a month, UPFA MP Mahindananda Alutgamage told in Parliament yesterday.
He was joining the committee stage debate of the budget proposals held for the 11th allotted day under the financial heads of the Public Administration and Management Ministry, Industry and Commerce Ministry and Enterprise Development Ministry.
“The trade union action scheduled to be held on 17th had been called off by two trade union activists who support the government. The Prime Minister is trying to dilute the public service which is essential to a poor country like ours,” he said.
Alutgamage said around 44 state institutions had been privatised by the UNP from 2001 to 2004. They have laid the foundation for the second phase of the privatisation of state institutions, he said.
Strengthen public service - Prasanna Ranatunga
Measures should be taken to strengthen the public service. Privileges enjoyed by the public servants should be provided for them, UPFA MP Prasanna Ranatunga told in Parliament yesterday.
Joining the committee stage debate of the budget proposals 2016 for the 11th allotted day held under the financial heads of Public Administration, Industry and Commerce and Public Enterprise Development, Ranatunga said the people expected cost of living reduction, but it has gone up.
“Public servants lost their privileges. I urge the government to fulfill the promises made prior to the election,” he said.
He said the Judges of the courts and university academics do not get anything other than the salary. The government should reconsider these issues, he said.
UNP governments gave priority to privatisation. People are reluctant to join the public sector due to the fear of losing privileges, he said.
He urged the government to treat the workers of the central government and provincial government equally.
