Pakistan, SL military delegates discuss paperless environment

The military delegation from Pakistan’s armed forces scheduled to attend the annual ‘Staff Talks’ with their Sri Lankan counterparts, exchanged views on the latest Information Technology techniques and communication with special focus on the implementation of paperless environment, with Chief of Staff Major General Amal Karunasekara at the Army Headquarters, recently.
The delegation comprised Major General Hafeez Ur Rehman, Head of the delegation, Brigadier Syed Imran Akhtar and Colonel Sajjad Ali.
Major General Amal Karunasekara, extending best wishes on the scheduled ‘Sri Lanka - Pakistan Army to Army Staff Talks,’ presented the delegates with symbolic mementos and the gesture was reciprocated. This is the 4th annual round of Staff Talks.
In keeping with the scheduled programme, the Pakistan delegation and the Sri Lankan delegation headed by Major General Ajith Wijesinghe, Chief Signal Officer are to meet at the Sri Lanka Signal Corps Regimental Centre to commence the annual ‘Staff Talks’. The annual dialogue between Pakistan and Sri Lanka defence establishments has immensely benefitted Sri Lanka’s tri-services in many ways in terms of training, logistics, career planning, research and development, and administrative aspects since its inception about four years ago.
