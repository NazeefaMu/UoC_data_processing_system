Magistrate reprimands  Yashoda Range Bandara

Chilaw Magistrate and District Judge Manjula Ratnayake severely reprimanded Yashoda Range Bandara for his failure to repair the house damaged in the accident.
The case relating to the recent Chilaw Kottapitiya Junction motor accident created an upheaval in the area. It was called in the Chilaw Magistrate’s Court on June 28. Although Attorney Vajira Ranasinghe who appeared for Yashoda Range Bandara pleaded for two weeks time to repair the house, Magistrate and District Judge Manjula Ratnayake ordered that repair work should be completed before July 5.
He also ordered the Arachchikattuwa Police to submit a report in court on that day about the progress of the work. The Defence Counsel also submitted that the laptop computer and the television set had been brought to Court.
Counsel Chinthaka Karunaratne appearing for the aggrieved party said the repair restoration of the damaged house should be urgently completed since two children resident in the home are due to sit the GCE Advanced Level Examination this year.
In the wee hours of June 6, a double cab in which a group of people were returning after attending a party at a Karukapane hotel ran off the road at Kottapitiya junction and crashed into a house causing severe damage to the house and the vehicle. It was later revealed that the double cab was driven by Yashoda Range Bandara, Media Secretary to the State Minister of Disaster Management.
The Secretary to the Ministry of Disaster Management in a statement to the Arachchikattuwa Police later said the double cab had been assigned to Yashoda Range Bandara for official duties.
The Arachchikattuwa Police has recorded statements from both Yashoda Range Bandara and the official driver of the double cab and the latter had stated that he was not driving the double cab on that day.
Arachchikattuwa Police are conducting further investigations.
