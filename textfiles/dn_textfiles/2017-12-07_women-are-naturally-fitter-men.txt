Women are naturally  fitter men!

Women are naturally fitter than men, new research reveals. Females process oxygen 30 percent more efficiently than their male counterparts, a study found.
Quick oxygen uptake is a measure of fitness and associated with a reduced risk of muscle fatigue. Study author Professor Richard Hughson from the University of Waterloo in Ontario, said: ‘We found that women’s muscles extract oxygen from the blood faster, which, scientifically speaking, indicates a superior aerobic system.’
Lead author Professor Thomas Beltrame added: ‘While we don’t know why women have faster oxygen uptake, this study shakes up conventional wisdom.’
The researchers analyzed 18 healthy, active adults, half of which were men and the remainder women.
All of the study’s participants completed four moderate-intensity treadmill tests.
Their heart rate and oxygen tissue content were assessed, as well as the difference in oxygen levels between their veins and arteries being investigated.
‘Shakes up conventional wisdom’
Results reveal women process oxygen more quickly than men when exercising.
For unclear reasons, females are around 30 percent more efficient at processing oxygen than their males counterparts.
Quick oxygen uptake is a measure of fitness and associated with a reduced risk of muscle fatigue.
Professor Hughson said: ‘We found that women’s muscles extract oxygen from the blood faster, which, scientifically speaking, indicates a superior aerobic system.
Professor Beltrame added: ‘While we don’t know why women have faster oxygen uptake, this study shakes up conventional wisdom.
‘It could change the way we approach assessment and athletic training down the road.’
The findings were published in the journal Applied Physiology, Nutrition, and Metabolism.
