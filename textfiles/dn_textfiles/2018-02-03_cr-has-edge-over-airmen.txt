CR has the edge over Airmen

The unpredictable CR & FC will go out favourites against Air Force Sports Club in their Dialog ‘A’ Division League rugby return game today at CR & FC grounds in Longden Place, Colombo today. Match will commence at 4.00 pm.
Airmen had a poor game against Police Sports Club in their last match at Police Park thus losing the game after a close fight by 12 points to 18 i, hence they will have to give an improved performance if they hope to beat the Red shirts outfit.
Meanwhile the CR side who turned tables on Havelock SC side in their last outing at Havelock Park last week will go all out to give a similar performance to obtain a bonus point victory against the Airmen at their own den in Longden Place.
All will depend on how Air Force players in the calibre of Radeesha Seneviratne, Gayantha Iddamalgoda, Saraka Weralla, lanky Thilina Bandara, Medagedara brothers, Dimithri Patabandi, Ranindu Padmasanka, Nuwan Perera, along with their ever green national centre Charith Seneviratne will perform in this game.
