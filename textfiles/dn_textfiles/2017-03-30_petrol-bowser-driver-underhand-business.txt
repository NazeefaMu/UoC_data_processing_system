The driver of a petrol bowser transporting fuel from the Kolonnawa Ceylon Petroleum Corporation installations to Anuradhapura, was caught siphoning off petrol from the bowser near the ‘Sudu Palama’ in Sravastipura for sale to a businessman, by officers of the Anuradhapura Police operations unit on Tuesday.
Police also arrested the businessman along with a small van lodged with 24 cans of 470 litres of petrol, an empty can and a rubber hose used to draw the fuel from the bowser.
Investigations revealed that the driver had charged Rs. 50 per litre of petrol from the businessman. The bowser driver and the businessman were to be produced before the Anuradhapura Magistrate yesterday.
