GMOA writes letter to Parliamentarians on Health Minister’s biased conduct

 
The Government Medical Officers Association (GMOA) has sent a letter to all Parliamentarians requesting to raise the issue of the biased conduct of the Health Minister Rajitha Senarate in the Parliament, GMOA Secretary Haritha Aluthge said.
Addressing a press conference held at the GMOA Headquarters in Colombo today he said that in the letter, the GMOA requested all MPs to raise the issue of government’s inability to solve the SAITM issue and the general crisis the health sector has fallen into due to the Health Minister’s conduct. 
Aluthge said that the letter especially addresses allegations against the Health Minister for showing partiality when solving the SAITM issue since a close relation of the Health Minister is studying in SAITM and handing over the responsibility of solving the SAITM issue to the Health Minister. 
The letter consists of eight key points. 
In addition, the letter also points out some key issues to all the MPs. Some of them are ignoring the commonly agreed practical set of proposals presented to solve the SAITM issue, pumping Rs. 3000 million of public funds annually to maintain a privately owned hospital, not gazetting the minimum standards of medical education and purposely sabotaging all solutions and efforts made by the President and Prime Minister to solve the SAITM issue, he added.
