Politically irrational

Most of the leading politicians of all parties are obsessed with power. Such obsessions are due to different reasons. Such obsessions lead level heads necessary for sound judgement getting distorted towards irrational thinking. Because of their distorted and biased thinking, important decisions are taken in a manner that adversely affects the well-being of this country’s ordinary people far from the corridors of power. Most politicians on the national stage are those who have not had a wholesome education and even some of those who have neglected the growth and development of their own character. They have become narcissistic, vain and self-absorbed. So their mindset is one dimensional. That is why even in the present situation of the country, they prioritize the victory of their party at the ‘next election’ rather than prioritize matters that relate to the lasting development of all people of the country. It is a national misfortune that such characters occupy niches in politics.
Peoples’ right to differ
Appointments to highly important positions in government such as to various ministries, the judiciary, law enforcement agencies, representation in foreign countries, public administration and home affairs, banking, investments, publicity and trade need to be made with circumspection and insight.
The quality of the education that many representative politicians elected to power is evidently so low that they seem to be congenitally incapable of making sound rational decisions dependent on proper judgements of matters relating to the decisions that need to be taken. Decisions at the highest levels of government have not only political and economic implications, there are also social and moral implications that also devolve on issues of reconciliation and peace. They do not think of social and moral implications unless they are compelled to do so by others. The Katunayake and Rathupaswela disasters, as well as the killing and disappearance of journalists such as Lasantha Wickrematunge and Ekneligoda and the assassination of the ruggerite Thajudeen, are results of this type of self-absorbed thinking. Then government wanted to assert its power rather than heeding the basic needs and rights of the people and the peoples’ right to differ from the government’s point of view.
High office to qualified people
Public debates are going on some of the other matters of great interest to the people such as the trillions of rupees of debt incurred, the Mattala airport, Hambantota harbour, Uma Oya, buying of military aircrafts and warships, sitting of armouries, of the last government and the bond issue, interference with criminal investigations and even training and appointment of school principals and teachers.
There are many other issues in which the rights of the people and the common good are blatantly disregarded by powerful politicians who show themselves to be nothing but ministerial blockheads.
By being elected on a party ticket or by being appointed by a political power holder doesn’t endow them with the necessary intelligence to make rational and just decisions on highly important matters. They are not only divided between the party and opportunistic ideological lines but also on racial, religious-cultural, caste and clannish prejudices that they have inherited and unthinkingly continue. Therefore, it is very important that only well attested and duly qualified people free from racial, religious and caste, ideological bias should be appointed to hold any of the most important positions of government and administration in any sector and to counsel those in positions of power.
Corruption leads to irrationality
When elected politicians take decisions, they should not go by their feelings and hunches which they often do; they should base their decisions on proper assessments and judgements. Proper judgements could be had only after consulting the most suitable persons qualified to make such good evaluation of the relevant data pertinent to the matter under consideration.
When politicians make judgements about complex financial and economic matters without availing themselves of the good counsel of experts in the field, politicians not only make a mess of things, they also create a mess for the country and the people. Thereafter they create a mess out of clearing the mess created by the former rulers because all of them together not only have dirtied their hands, they also have corrupt hearts and scheming and self-absorbed minds that distort their judgements and make their decisions irrational.
Political polarization and throwing shallow challenges, a product of superficial rather than objective and critical thinking on important matters seem to be the order of the day. Most leading politicians are playing to the gallery, making also foolish promises, just for the sake of garnering votes. At this task, they are often clever. They do not strive at the harder task of explaining serious issues the country is facing and educating the people to understand them and getting their support to solve them. Promoting oneself through a narrow party policy rather than promoting the good of the country and its entire people is at the base of the thinking of most politicians.
Politicians, reform yourselves!
The parties in power wish to ‘save’ the people promising to provide what is necessary for a good life. An economic crisis is looming ahead as a result of a massive debt which has to be settled. The debt incurred as a result of prioritizing projects that have turned out to be white elephants and through the corruption of their kith and kin and theirs phoning off commissions and banking them in hidden secret accounts abroad. The party aspiring to power has no clue either as to how they are going to settle the debts. Their rationality is at the lowest possible ebb. Their appeal is to populism. They will be more than content to enjoy the plums of political power and luxuries of affluent life presently even while they incur more debts to settle the present debts and landing the country in a vicious debt circle darkening the lives of future generations.
These politicians do not like reforming their ways. They are envious even of those who successfully serve the country largely independent of politicians’ political patronage. Envy and suspicion always distort reasoning and lead to bad decisions. Ever since Independence, this is what has been happening due to the short-sightedness of scheming politicians, well set in their mould of a tunnel vision and indulging in irrational thinking.
What we are seeing today is a bunch of uneducated, crooked politicians disagreeing among themselves as to how to divide and eat the cake and still have it. They have together landed this country into this tragic situation. Corrupt as they are, they all want to blame someone else and wash their hands off while preserving their dirty character. The people are faced with a choice between two evils. They need to be wise enough to choose the lesser evil between the discarded corrupt rogues and there formable who should be amenable to the voice of the people and are able to discard the rogues among them.
