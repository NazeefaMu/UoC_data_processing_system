Tax to be imposed on abandoned lands in Western Province

 
Western Province Chief Minister Isura Devapriya said that a 2 percent tax from the land value in the Western Province will be imposed on abandoned lands from today.
The decision was made with the massive spread of dengue fever in the Western Province.
Epidemiology Unit said last month that the highest number of dengue patients, which is over 25,279, was reported from the Western Province and the highest number of dengue patients, 13,111 was reported from the Colombo District.
