'Kurunegala Hospital crippled'

The administrative work of the Kurunegala Teaching Hospital was reported to have been crippled as there was no Director to carry out official functions for over a year, a hospital official told the Daily News recently.
Although an Acting Director was assigned, he had been unable to take the necessary measures due to the limited powers he had been granted, they said.Staff members, doctors and patients were all inconvenienced as a result, they added.
