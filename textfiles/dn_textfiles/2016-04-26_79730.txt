Love conquers all for the ‘Huntsman’

It’s already a given that the love shared by the Huntsman (Chris Hemsworth) and his wife Sara (Jessica Chastain) is the driving force of the new movie ‘The Huntsman: Winter’s War,’ but director Cedric Nicolas-Troyan said that there are many other aspects of love that they explored in the film.
“The whole movie is about love. Love conquers all. But, love conquers all doesn’t mean just the love between a man and a woman. It’s the love between a mother and a child. It’s the love between a child and its mother. It’s the love between sister and her siblings,” he told Collider.
“It’s love conquers all, but it’s all kinds of love, all the versions of love. It was about which version we were going to do with Emily [Blunt], and it was the mother-child version, the pain version, the love lost version,” he added.
One of the challenges Nicolas-Troyan faced while making the film was how to distinguish Blunt’s ice queen Freya from Charlize Theron’s Ravenna.
“We knew Freya could not be just like Ravenna. Otherwise, there would be two Ravennas, and it would be a little bit like an echo of itself,” he said.
So, Nicolas-Troyan decided that Freya would have a strong motherly instinct, although the loss of her child somewhat clouded her judgment. Her character was “more quiet, more introspective and more motherly” than Ravenna could ever hope to be.
Meanwhile, Blunt said during an earlier interview that she really enjoyed playing Freya because of her complex nature.
“She’s not just this rampaging villain. She’s actually someone who, as delusional as she is, is thinking she’s doing the right thing — and that was exciting to me,” she told C Magazine.
“You’d be surprised by how much I enjoyed [playing an evil queen] and how easy it was to be this person, which is worrying,” Blunt jokingly added. ‘The Huntsman: Winter’s War’ in 3D format is screening at Liberty Lite, Colombo, Cinemax, Ja-Ela and Chaya, Kegalle. It is imported by Liberty Cinemas Ltd.
