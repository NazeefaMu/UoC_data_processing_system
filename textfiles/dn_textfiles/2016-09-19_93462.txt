Janishka’s ton propels St.Sebastian’s to the finals

Janishka Perera’s entertaining century followed by Shanel Fernando’s cracking 82 helped St.Sebastian’s amass 310 for nine in 90 overs after they won the toss and decided to bat first in their U15 D1 semifinal fixture against their town-mate Prince of Wales. As Prince of Wales in reply managed only 155 with Osanda making the top score of 28 not out following his five-for with the ball, St.Sebastian’s with first innings advantage were declared winners after the match settled for an amicable draw. Shanel Fernando and Chamod Mendis bowled well for the winners.
St. Sebastians ‘A’: 310/9 in 90 overs (Janishka Perera 109, Shanel Fernando 82,Sukitha Prasanna 40, Osanda Sandaruwan 5/58,Kaveen Chthushka 2/32)
Prince of Wales ‘A’: 155 in 80 overs (Upeka Fernando 24, Samudra Medis 19, Osanda Sandaruwan 28*, Shanel Fernando 2/24, Chamod Mendis 2/25)
