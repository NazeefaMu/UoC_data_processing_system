Food for drought affected temples

The Government will provide a basket of food items worth Rs. 5,000 to each temple in drought affected areas since devotees in these areas find it difficult to provide dana to the Maha Sangha.
Buddha Sasana Minister Gamini Jayawickreme Perera disclosed this when he called on the Malwatte and the Asgiriya Prelates at their temples in Kandy and received blessings on September 2.
The Minister regretted the recent controversy at the Ruhunu Maha Kataragama Devalaya and said he hoped to bring in regulations governing devalayas through a parliamentary act.
He said he has paid attention towards making a daham pasal certificate compulsory to obtain jobs in the state sector.
Most Ven. Thibbotuwawe Sri Sumangala Maha Thera of the Malwatte Chapter said he had struggled for 12 years to get the Buddhist Vihara and Devalagam Act and the Theravada Ecclesiastical Code registered without any success since no one came to his assistance to get it done. Ultimately he had decided to keep mum about it.
The Most Ven, Warakagoda Sri Gnanarathana Mahanayake Thera of the Asgiriya Champter said he witnessed many shortcomings at northern temples during his recent tour of Jaffna and a programme should be launched to address the situation.
