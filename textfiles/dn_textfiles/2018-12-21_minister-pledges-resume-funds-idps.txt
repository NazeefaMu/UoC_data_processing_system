Minister pledges to resume funds for IDPs

Newly-appointed Industry and Commerce Minister Rishad Bathiudeen pledged to resume funds for Internally-displaced Persons (IDP), which were slashed by the recently-dismissed administration.
“As an MP representing the Northern Vanni District, I congratulate our Prime Minister Ranil Wickemesinghe’s appointment as the National Policies, Economic Affairs, Resettlement, Rehabilitation, Northern Province Development, Vocational Training, Skills development, and Youth Affairs Minister,” Minister Bathiudeen said.
“Particularly, his role as the Resettlement, Rehabilitation, Northern Province Development Minister shall no doubt uplift the lives of people in the Northern region, aside from raising its provincial Gross Domestic Product (GDP). Furthermore, as the Resettlement of Protracted Displaced Persons Minister, I look forward to reinstate funds earmarked to support protracted IDPs in the North,” he said.
“These IDPs were inconvenienced when because we were wrongfully slashed by the recent illegal government,” the minister added. Having learnt of the slashing of funds for IDPs, Minister Bathiudeen staged a protest on November 30 and said, “These long-term IDPs, most of them Muslims in Northern Province, are the group to suffer the longest due to the conflict. The government’s support for their resettlement and welfare is vital as there is no one else to spend for them,” Minister Bathiudeen said.
“Before our former Cabinet was replaced by the illegal government on October 26, the former Cabinet had approved funds for the resettlement of these IDPs. Approval was given following a thorough process, and it was also cleared by the previous Policy-planning Ministry,” he added.
“Using these approved allocations, resettlement work already began in August. It is unfortunate that the disputed PM slashed Rs.250 million from these allocations. Despite leading an illegitimate government, he had also instructed to divert this Rs.250 million for other work,” the minister said.
