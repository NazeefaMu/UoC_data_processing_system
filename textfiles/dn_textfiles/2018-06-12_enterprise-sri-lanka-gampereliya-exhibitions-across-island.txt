Enterprise Sri Lanka, Gampereliya exhibitions across island

The government is planning to hold a series of exhibitions across the country to take the message of Enterprise Sri Lanka and Gampereliya to the people.
The Enterprise Sri Lanka loan schemes will be ceremonially launched by the President and the Prime Minister on June 22 at the BMICH. Enterprise Sri Lanka and Gamperaliya would be the two key economic programs of the government that are aimed at accelerating economic growth and upgrading rural economies around the country.

Through Enterprise Sri Lanka, the government wants to recreate the entrepreneur spirit that existed in the era prior to the colonial times, Finance Minister Mangala Samaraweera told a recent forum, adding that, “Our people have become accustomed to waiting for government jobs and handouts whilst entrepreneurship has been relegated. These proposed exhibitions will create a platform to change this mind-set. Along with introducing the loan schemes and their features, the Enterprise Sri Lanka exhibitions will provide a platform for guidance, training, and mentorship for potential entrepreneurs. It will create opportunity to connect their business ideas with markets and larger companies in the ecosystem.”
In this forum where the minister met the business community, he also sought the support of the business community towards the Enterprise Sri Lanka program and said, “We hope we will have your support and commitment for this venture for the betterment of Sri Lanka.”

These measures will collectively inject more cash into the rural economy which will help improve economic activity and kick start broader consumption across the country in a sustainable manner, according to the Finance Ministry.
