Inspiration, Wits, Courage and the Will to survive

As September grinds thru Asia, oblivious of injuries from the Hong Kong astro grass leg...heading relentless to Korea...and concluding in Colombo at the splendid racecourse.
It’s defiantly an all or nothing theory for those seeking the RWC 7s qualifiers for 2019.
Our bronze finish means a real shot in both remaining legs.
However Sri have an arm long injury list...that just might make us match shy in Korea this weekend.
Despite regular skipper Muthu being match fit again.
Shehan Dias in for Gayan Weerey, and Nischon for Kavindu.
Coach Woods unfortunate with mounting injuries.....and certainly concerns.
Hard to accept but can the team target no 2?
Finishing 3 might be fair...but not if we are seeking the qualifying cut for the 7s World Cup.
Natural for all our island rugby fans and that exceptional breed of "deckchair expert" to have the highest hopes this season.
But with reality much much tougher than fiction...Sri will rely hugely on belief, skill, petrol and sheer guts for Sooriyabandara to conjure some unforgiving finishes against the might of Japan, HK and Korea.
Performance under pressure is such a compulsive grey area.
So its the hardest burden and oversized injury baggage for team Lanka.
Targets and reality our Achilles heel for this Asian series.
Legitimate for more time between legs...a bear that Ross Mitchell and his band of skilled administrators need to consider.
Alas this Septimus...the time is upon a new look Sri Lanka to carve up some 7s history.
Blessings for brilliance in the middle to both our men led by Muthutantri, and our women by new captain Sanju Wijeytilake.
Bula bula Sri Api!
