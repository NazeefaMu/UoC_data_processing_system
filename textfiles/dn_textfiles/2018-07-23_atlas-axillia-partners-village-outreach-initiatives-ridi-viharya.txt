Atlas Axillia partners with village outreach initiatives of Ridi Viharya

In an endeavour that has warmed the hearts of the community and reached across rural villages of Sri Lanka, Atlas Axillia has been partnering the village outreach initiatives of the Ridi Viharaya, under the aegis of the Mahanayake of the Malwatte Chapter, Most Ven. Thibobotuwawe Sri SumangalaThera and Ven. Thibotuwawe BuddharakkithaThera, NayakeThera of the Ridi Viharaya for over a decade.
As a company committed to facilitating learning tools for educational pursuits, Atlas Axillia has succeeded in empowering students of rural communities through the initiative that consists of providing school supplies and books to 5,000 children spread across some of the neediest communities in Sri Lanka. The program has been held consistently for 15 years and is recognized as the primary community outreach of the historic Ridi Viharaya.
Commenting on the initiative, Ven. Thibbotuwawe Buddharakkitha Thera, Nayake Thera of the Ridi Viharaya, located in Ridigama, Kurunegala District, says that the program has rendered a valuable service towards society.
“The Ridi Viharaya appreciates the gesture of Atlas Axillia in joining us in this noble venture which offers considerable benefit to children who cannot afford to purchase school supplies every year.” Ven. Thera observes.
A well-known leader in the industry of school supplies and related products, Atlas Axillia believes that sustaining this partnership with Ridi Viharaya is of tremendous significance as one that articulates the Company’s commitment towards sustainable community partnerships. “We believe that this is an important commitment built over time and look forward to strengthening the initiative further, in the future” says Asitha Samaraweera Managing Director of Atlas Axillia.
The program commenced under the direction of the former owner and Managing Director of Atlas Axillia, Nirmal Madanayake, who believes that it amplified the Company’s pledge towards empowering the community in addressing a much-felt need, one that must be met every year.
Through ventures such as this, Atlas Axillia continues to reaffirm its strongly Sri Lankan heritage as the Company seeks to harness the creativity and the talents of Sri Lankan children through multi-faceted programs and initiatives throughout the country.
