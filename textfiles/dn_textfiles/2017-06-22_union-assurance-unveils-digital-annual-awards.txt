Union Assurance unveils digital annual awards

Union Assurance (UA) has once again turned a new chapter in their history by organizing the first-ever offshore annual awards.
This award ceremony is one of the main flagship events in the UA annual calendar and focuses on acknowledging the top sales performers for the excellence showcased during the year 2016.
This is the first-ever annual awards of this nature, themed as 'Success Beyond Borders - Digital First' and was held on June 19 at Hotel Istana, Kular Lampur.
This event was live-streamed to the local event which was held in Colombo and it will be a first of its kind initiative in the Sri Lankan insurance industry.
Union Assurance has already set its trends within the industry by introducing innovative ways to acknowledge and appreciate the genuine commitments and excellent services performed by their salesforce.
UA has already established and launched several programmes to keep in pace with the digital transformation which has revolutionized the insurance industry. Novel digital platforms are also in the process of implementing which will be introduced to the industry in the near future.
Union Assurance successfully integrates the social media platforms to actively serve its customers and to rectify the brand awareness.
A fully professional sales force which is digitally enabled with tab devices and most convenient software solutions such as DAT and FAME systems has provided remarkable benefits towards extending an uninterrupted, high-quality service towards all its stakeholders. Union Assurance Voice - a dedicated Facebook Group - was launched recently to build an engaging communication platform within the Union Assurance salesforce.
Union Assurance has always continued to have a performance-based culture and believes in investing in its people for their development and to recognize their achievements.
By innovatively strategizing its business model through digital first aspects, Union Assurance strongly believes to incorporate and deliver the true values and excellence of service and ultimately dedicates its efforts to be the true partner in achieving success.
