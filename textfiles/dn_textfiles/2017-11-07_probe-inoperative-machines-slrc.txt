Probe into inoperative machines at SLRC

The Sri Lanka Rupavahini Corporation has appointed a three-member team of its own officials to probe the import of five character generator machines at a cost of Rs. 18 million during the Rajapaksa regime which have proved inoperative. The team appointed under the supervision of SLRC Director General Attorney Thusira Malawwethantri is reported to have commenced the investigation yesterday itself.
The five machines have been stacked in a corner as they cannot be used.
