Colombo Chief Magistrate Lanka Jayarathne yesterday ordered the Cinnamon Gardens Police to file an amended charge sheet against National Freedom Front Leader (NFF) Wimal Weerawansa and five other party activists for allegedly providing leadership to a protest which blocked the main roads at Bauddhaloka Mawatha, causing disturbance to the people and the normal flow of traffic.
The NFF staged the protest march against the visiting United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights Zeid Ra’ad Al Hussein On February 6, 2016.
On a previous occassion, the Cinnamon Gardens Police submitted an amended charge sheet related to six suspects before the Magistrate and stated that they were still to find any information regarding the seventh suspect.
Six suspects including NFF leader and Colombo District MP Wimal Weerawansa, Jayantha Samaraweera, Weerakumara Dissanayake, Piyasiri Wijenayake, Roger Seneviratne and Mohammed Muzammil.
The seventh accused Lalith Chaminda Jayalal did not appear before the Court yesterday.
Cinnamon Gardens Police informed the Magistrate that the suspects who organised the procession had failed to obtain prior permission from the Police to stage the march.
Police further alleged that the organizers had also used loudspeakers without a valid licence. Police further submitted to Court that the suspects provided leadership to a protest which blocked the main road at Bauddhaloka Mawatha towards Havelock Town, causing an inconvenience to the people and the normal flow of traffic.
After considering all the matters, the Magistrate ordered Cinnamon Gardens Police to file an amended charge sheet against the first six suspects and fixed further inquiries for November 16.
