Govt. paying Rs. 1.9 billion consultancy fees to foreign firm: GL

The Government is paying Rs 1.9 billion as consultancy fees to a foreign firm contracted to operate the State machinery in this country, alleged former Minister Prof G L Peiris, addressing a press conference organized by the Joint Opposition Economic Research Committee at the Sri Vajirashrama in Punchi Borella.
Prof. Peiris said the government had an attitudinal problem of treating everything local as anathema. The government's policy was to seek foreign solutions to our local problems.
He said the government had contracted a US firm in Maryland to restructure the State administrative machinery at a cost of Rs 1.9 billion.
This particular US company had a questionable and notorious history and its past record had been inimical to democracy.
