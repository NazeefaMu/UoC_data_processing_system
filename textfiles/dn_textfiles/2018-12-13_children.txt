Jurassic Park   A cinematic spectacle
My favourite film, book, soundtrack and videogame all have one thing in common: Jurassic Park. My love for the film, and the extent to which it has influenced me, cannot be expressed by mere words. Whether in music, my interest in palaeontology or even in writing, Jurassic Park has been influential.
Spielberg’s film is superbly crafted, with some of the most awe-inspiring and terrifying sequences in cinematic history. However, there is one moment that truly defines this movie, and the magic it possesses. The ‘Welcome to Jurassic Park’ sequence is not only my favourite moment of cinema, but also one of the most impactful and revolutionary scenes of all time.
This scene perfectly captures the wonder of seeing a dinosaur for the very first time. Three essential factors contribute towards this, and the first of these is the dinosaur itself. In this case, the dinosaur is an eighty foot, fifty ton Brachiosaurus. With its imperial, giraffe like profile and elegant stance, the simple sight of it striding to feed from the treetops is mesmerising. Its ethereal call and the way the ground quakes with its every step truly capture its magnificence. The groundbreaking special effects, perhaps the most influential aspect of the film, brought this docile herbivore to life in the best possible way.
It’s one thing to reconstruct a dinosaur. It’s another to pretend to see one. Acting is another essential factor that immerses the audience in a film, and the cast of Jurassic Park did not fail in their performances. The characters of Alan Grant and Ellie Sattler are portrayed brilliantly by Sam Neill and Laura Dern, reflecting the reactions of any palaeontologist or dinosaur enthusiast. Even the sarcastic mathematician, Ian Malcolm, portrayed by Jeff Goldblum, cannot help but grin in joy at the sight. The reactions of the characters were the mirror images of the audiences’ reactions. These reactions were significant for two reasons. The more obvious reason is the wonder of the special effects themselves. Such quality visuals were as new to the audience as the resurrected dinosaurs were to the characters. Secondly, and more importantly, the depiction of dinosaurs in the film was unlike anything ever seen in cinema. For generations, dinosaurs were presented as ugly, dim and unrealistically vicious monsters. Jurassic Park would forever change that perception, and audiences were able to see dinosaurs for what they were: elegant, active and reasonably intelligent creatures.
The final, essential factor is perhaps the one that binds all the aforementioned qualities together, and one that is unfortunately overlooked in modern times: the music. While John Williams may indeed be a god in composing; his soundtracks for Star Wars, Superman, Harry Potter and many others being regarded in legendary status, his soundtrack for Jurassic Park was indescribably extraordinary. Never since Star Wars had Williams’s themes been so powerful and absolutely perfect in representing various concepts. For the ‘Welcome to Jurassic Park’ sequence Williams used the film’s main theme to represent the majesty and splendour of the dinosaurs. Beginning as a grand, stately melody, the theme grows in strength and grandeur, parallel to the characters’ increasing amazement. This theme is the final part of this near perfect sequence. As the park is presented to us, the theme reaches a spectacular crescendo unparalleled in film history, and as it finally fades away, signalling the end of the sequence, we can be left with no doubt that we are in for the cinematic experience of a lifetime.
‘Welcome to Jurassic Park’ is more than just a scene. It is a sequence showcasing every element required to make a standout scene, and revolutionised, not just filmmaking, but how we see these leviathans of the past. The whole world was able to watch, spellbound, as dinosaurs walked the earth for the first time in sixty-five million years. For many, this scene defines a moment of their childhood and, twenty-five years later, stands the test of time, as a moment of movie magic. This scene has influenced me more than anything, and continues to do so. The fact that I can’t help but grin every time I watch it is definitive proof that this moment must surely be cinema at its most spectacular.
