The art of living

Vedanta is a philosophy that presents the eternal and universal principles of life and living founded by an eminent philosopher A. Parthasarathy, popularly known as Swamiji. It provides the technique to achieve success and peace in all aspects of life – official, social and domestic.
The Vedanta Institute Colombo disseminates the values of Vedanta to people of all walks of life. Umayal Venugopal speaks to daughter-disciple of Swami Parthasarathy, Sunandaji who will be delivering discourse series on the chapter XVIII of the Bhagavad Gita from March 2 to 6 on Vedanta the ancient philosophy of India.
* What is Vedanta?
“Vedanta” is derived from two Sanskrit words “veda” and “anta”. “Veda” means knowledge and “anta” means end. Hence Vedanta literally means culmination of knowledge. The knowledge of one’s real self.
Vedanta explains the true meaning and purpose of life - expounding eternal truths that do not change with time. People fail to understand that living is an art, a skill, a technique. If the principles are not learnt and implemented, life will be full of strife and struggle.
Vedanta is scientific in its approach. It trains one to think independently and not follow blind faith, superstitions and rituals. The philosophy shows the way to the state of human perfection which is enlightenment.
* What is the relevance of Bhagavad Gita in the modern world? How does it help in day to day life?
Bhagavad Gita is a manual for life. The message of the Bhagavad Gita is scientific and universal. It is referred to as Sanathana Dharma or Eternal Truths of life meant for entire humanity, irrespective of cast, creed, religion, race, gender or age. It establishes the existence of the highest Truth and prescribes different techniques to recognise it.
With this knowledge one is able to live a life of dynamism and peace. People often become helpless victims to challenges of the world incapable of dealing with situations.
They succumb to external pressures and stress. The knowledge of the Bhagavad Gita fortifies the human intellect with knowledge and prepares one to face and overcome any challenge in the world. Lead a stress-free and successful life.
* Can you tell us about Swami Parthasarathy and Vedanta Academy?
My father and guru has been rendering service to humanity for over 60 years through four avenues:
1. Swamiji has authored 11 books, a product of extensive research for over 30 years.
2. He has been imparting the philosophy of Vedanta, the message of the Bhagavad Gita and their practical application in life to individuals and general public around the world.
3. His pioneering lifetime research has formulated Self-management courses for corporations worldwide. He has been acclaimed as one of the leading corporate gurus for international organisations and business schools.
4. In 1988 Swamiji founded the Vedanta Academy, which runs continual three-year residential courses to impart the knowledge of Vedanta to youngsters from India and abroad. At the academy students enquire, reflect, contemplate upon concepts and ideas presented through the various texts. Question and answer sessions are conducted daily to aid and develop the process of thinking. The students follow a schedule which begins at 4:15 am and concludes at 9 pm. The schedule is designed on the three traditional disciplines- Karma Yoga: Path of action, Bhakti Yoga: Path of Devotion and Jnana Yoga: Path of Knowledge.
* Swamiji has written many books. What book do you recommend to a person who just begins to pursue the spiritual path?
It is essential to cover a minimum of the following four books in the given order: The Fall of the Human Intellect, Governing Business and Relationships, The Holocaust of Attachment, and Vedanta Treatise: The Eternities. These books would prepare one’s inner personality and help face the challenges of the world. The knowledge also leads one to the ultimate state of human perfection. The best time to study this literature is in the early hours of the morning, ideally between 4 and 6 am or as close to this time as possible.
* After completing the three years Diploma in Vedanta course, what do the students do? Can they go back and pursue their interest i.e. study/work or do they have to stay at the Vedanta Academy?
The academy course is designed for three years. After the completion of the course, students may opt for continuing their interest in Vedanta by serving the cause either in India or any place abroad. A few choose to pursue their interests in the world.
* How often do you come to Sri Lanka? What are the activities you do in Sri Lanka? How are you planning to promote Vedanta in Sri Lanka in future?
Swamiji has been visiting Sri Lanka annually since the 70’s to conduct lecture series on the Bhagavad Gita for the general public. Since 2002 I have been carrying on with the same work on the island.
Every year one chapter of the Bhagavad Gita is presented to the public. Accordingly, it would take about 18 years to complete the entire Bhagavad Gita.
People of different ages, particularly the youth, who have been following these lecture series could further help themselves by studying the recommended books.
In addition, they now have the option of the Vedanta E-learning course through a structured course on Vedanta philosophy comprising video lectures and question and answer sessions by Swamiji. For more details visit elearning.vedantaworld.org
