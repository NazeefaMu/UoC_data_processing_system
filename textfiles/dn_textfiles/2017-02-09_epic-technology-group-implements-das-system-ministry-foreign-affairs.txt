Epic Technology Group implements DAS system at Ministry of Foreign Affairs

Epic Technology group has re-energized the Consular Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs with a state-of-the-art eDocument Attesting System (e DAS).
This project was procured and managed under the leadership of the Information and Communication Technology Agency (ICTA). Citizens of Sri Lanka who use this system will experience a new level of customer service like never before at the Consular Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
This new technology implementation at the Consular Department will enable citizens to get their source documents and certificates attested and certified within a maximum time span of 15 minutes, a process which used to take 6 -8 hours earlier.
The consular division of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs serves on an average of 500 citizens per day who require attesting and certifying their documents.
The department examines and certifies 1200 to 1500 documents per day. With this new (eDAS) system, the general public would spend only a maximum time of 15 minutes at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, while it reduces the cost of transaction to a bare minimum.
The second phase of enhancements to this system is already under consideration, where, with the enhancements, the citizens could even get prior appointments at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, if they intend to visit the consular division on a specific date to obtain their services by simply dialling 1995.
This fully integrated system will connect all major governmental institutions such as the Examinations Department, Department of Education, Department of Immigration & Emigration, Registrar of Persons Department, embassies, and foreign missions, etc. for real time verification and authentication of source documents within seconds.
Speaking at the launch of this National Service, Executive Chairman and Managing Director of Epic Technology Group Dr. Dehigama said “I am proud that Epic Technology Group has been able to join hands with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the ICTA to deliver this superior state-of-the art solution, which will directly benefit the citizens of Sri Lanka.
This is a revolutionary solution that will touch the hearts of many citizens. I also would like to extend my gratitude to Dr. Harsha de Silva, Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs, who lead the project from the forefront pushing and guiding everyone towards the goal.
Also, the ICTA lead by Muhunthan Canagey played an extraordinary role in making this dream come true”.
He added, “we take pride in being a 100% home grown entity, and when our technology can benefit our citizens directly it makes me extremely honoured and proud. Hats off to the Epic Team for a wonderful job done”.
