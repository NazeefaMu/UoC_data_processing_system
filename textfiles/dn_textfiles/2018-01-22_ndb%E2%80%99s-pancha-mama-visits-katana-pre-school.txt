NDB’s Pancha Mama visits Katana Pre-school

The National Development Bank has introduced its minor savings account along with “Pancha Mama” to instill the joy of saving in young children.
With this in mind, NDB’s Pancha Mama visited the Little Bird Pre-School where a special programme which combined education with entertainment was conducted. “Pancha Mama” – a famous character from the children’s show “Tikiri Peya” spent the day with the children, teaching them the joys of saving with fun games and activities.
The event was a massive success in terms of spreading the need to save and the Principal and the parents requested “Pancha Mama” to return to the school annually.
