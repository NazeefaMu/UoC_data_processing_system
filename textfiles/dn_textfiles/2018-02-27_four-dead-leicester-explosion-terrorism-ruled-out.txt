Four dead in Leicester explosion; terrorism ruled out

UK: Four people have died after a suspected explosion and subsequent fire destroyed a shop in Leicester, England, Police said.
Leicestershire police said another four people remained in hospital following the incident in the west of the city on Sunday night, one with serious injuries. Meanwhile, British police said Sunday there was no indication that the reported explosion and building collapse in Leicester was linked to terrorism.
“The cause of the explosion will be the subject of a joint investigation by the police and Leicestershire Fire and Rescue Service,” local police said in a statement.
“We would ask that the media and public do not speculate about the circumstances surrounding the incident, but at this stage there is no indication this is terrorist related.”
The apparent explosion occurred Sunday evening on a stretch of road containing commercial and residential properties close to the city centre.
“There are four confirmed fatalities at this stage and a number of people still undergoing treatment in hospital,” said Supt Shane O’Neill. “The building consisted of a shop premises on the ground level and a two-storey flat above it.
“We believe there may be people who have not yet been accounted for and rescue efforts continue in order to locate any further casualties. - AFP
