Ray Fernando rolls back the years

The annual Big match between Prince of Wales’ College and St. Sebastian’s College was inaugurated in 1933.
This encounter was worked off at their respective grounds vice versa and commenced at 12 noon on both days and the inaugural captains were Cambrian Duncan Fernando and Sebastianite Eugine de Silva. From 1938 to 1953 there was a stoppage due to unknown reasons.
Again in 1954 it was revived and it went on without any interruption until the second stoppage in 1968. It was revived again in 1971 and since then the Big Match has been played without any hindrance. This year both schools are meeting for the 68th occasion on 9 and 10 March. Since the commencement of the second series in 1968 this year it will be completing 50 years.
The 1968 captains were Ray Fernando of Cambrians and Marian Cooray of Sebastianites. Unfortunately Marian Cooray is no more and the Daily News was able to speak to Ray Fernando at his residence at 66, Jubilee Road, Laxapathiya, Moratuwa.

A – In the match against St Peter’s my vice captain Nimal Fernando took a catch off Denham Jurianz. But I noticed it was not clean and I asked from Nilmal whether it was clean. Nimal said no. Then I walked to the head umpire and told him that the catch was not clean and Denham walked away without any hesitation. The umpire asked me to call him back and I called him and he batted again.
