President Premadasa born and died  among people: Prime Minister

Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said President Premadasa born and died among the people. He dedicated himself for the people and he demised among people. His death is marked by the May Day which represents people.
Prime Minister Wikeremesinghe was speaking at the 24th commemoration of the former President, R. Premadasa held before the R.Premadasa statue in Hultsdorf, Colombo.
The international community has given Sri Lanka two years to deliver a national solution to the ethnic issue and boost national reconciliation process in the country, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said.
Wickremesinghe said the Yahapalana government will be able to realise national reconciliation and Sri Lankan identity - the former President R. Premadasa’s hope for Sri Lanka.
The Premier pointed out President Premadasa upheld a vision for one Sri Lankan nation. Wickremesinghe was referring to a speech made by President Premadasa where he said “If I was able to become the President of Sri Lanka, anybody can.” PM Wickremesinghe pointed out that former President meant no Sri Lankan should be discriminated due to their ethnicity or other differences.
Premier Wickremesinghe said an interim report by the Constitutional Council is in the making regarding a national solution and extensive discussions are being held regarding the matter with all religious leaders and the civil society.
The Prime Minister said the international community had Sri Lanka marginalised due to the spread of racism, religious conflicts and political hatred within the country in few years after the end of war. He pointed out the previous regime developed an antagonistic stance against the international arena instead of working with them. It was in a backdrop as such, the joint government headed by President Maithripala Sirisena came into being, the Premier pointed out.
The Prime Minister said rounds of discussions are held regarding devolution of power while ensuring the integrity and the sovereignty of Sri Lanka. He said human rights, election system and freedom of religious practices are topics that have been discussed in length as well.
