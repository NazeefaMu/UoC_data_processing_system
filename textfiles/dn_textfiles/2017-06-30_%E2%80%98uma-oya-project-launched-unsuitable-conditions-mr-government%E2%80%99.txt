‘Uma Oya Project launched in unsuitable conditions by MR government’

Former President Mahinda Rajapaksa’s government implemented the Uma Oya Project with the expertise of Iran even though their machines were not suitable to be used in a wet zone in which Uma Oya Project was to be implemented, United National Party (UNP) Galle District MP Wijepala Hettiarachchi said.
Speaking at a media briefing at Sirikotha, UNP Headquarters yesterday, he said no proper feasibility study was carried out prior to the implementation of the project.
Hettiarachchi said, “Former President Mahinda Rajapaksa puts the blame on the present government for the irregularities and negative effects of the project although the project was implemented by the former President in 2011 by obtaining a loan of Rs. 500 million. The UNP implemented the Mahaweli Project and it is successful even after it was implemented 30 years ago.”
The MP said the consensus government regained the GSP Plus tax concession leading to a rise in the apparel industry. Also, lifting the ban on Sri Lanka’s fisheries exports to the European market had opened up many opportunities for the country.
He said the present government had to face over eight hazards consecutively but the government managed to execute its responsibilities efficiently to provide relief for the victims.
Hettiarachchi said the government had spent over Rs. 62 million to construct buildings including cafeterias and aesthetic centres to all national schools and Rs. 200 million was allocated to build an allied health faculty.
Power and Renewable Energy Deputy Minister Ajith P. Perera also participated.
