Army Commander attends LANPAC Symposium in Honolulu

Army Commander Lieutenant General Mahesh Senanayake attended the US Army’s ‘LANPAC Symposium and Exposition’, organised by the Institute of Land Warfare in Honolulu, Hawaii, from May 22–24.
The annual world-class international forum of military intellectuals highlighted the role of land forces in the Indo-Pacific theatre and its contribution to the joint force in war and peace, under the theme, ‘The Future of Land Force Integration; Multilateral Approaches Across the Indo-Pacific’. A variety of relevant sub topics with special focus on emerging security threats was debated.
Regimental Sergeant Majors of the Indo-Pacific region attended the symposium and Lieutenant General Senanayake, on the sidelines of the sessions, met military leaders attending the event. Lieutenant General Senanayake called on US Army Commanding General, Pacific Command, General Robert B. Brown and discussed several issues of concern as well as matters relevant to continuing defence cooperation. The Exposition that got underway in parallel with the Symposium sessions also drew the attention of the visiting Army Commander, who closely observed the assortment of military products and hardware on display.
The Sri Lankan Army Chief was also among the invitees to a special banquet, hosted by General Brown.
Lieutenant General Senanayake’s retinue to Hawaii included Military Assistant to the Army Commander Colonel K.A.A. Udaya Kumara and Regimental Sergeant Major (RSM) Warrant Officer I.W.M.S.P. Wijesinghe, perhaps for the first time in the Army history in a Commander’s entourage.
Extensive thematic Symposium sessions focused on sub topics, such as “Assessing Shared Regional Security Challenges,” “Perspective of Land Forces in Combined Joint Operations,” “Exporting Global Partnership through Enlisted Professionalism/Development,” “Non-Kinetic Power Projection,” “Multi-domain Operations in Megacities,” “Sustainment of the Force in a Contested Environment,” “Developing Regional Leaders for a Complex World,” “Multilateral Approach to Humanitarian Assistance and Disaster Relief,” etc., which further broadened the spectrum of knowledge on related subjects.
