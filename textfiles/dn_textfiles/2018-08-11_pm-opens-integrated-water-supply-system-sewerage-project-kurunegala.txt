PM opens integrated water supply system, sewerage project in Kurunegala

Prime Minister Ranil Wickremasinghe will be in Kurunegala on August 13, where he would vest in the public the integrated water supply system and sewerage project.
The improvement and enhancement of the Kurunegala drinking water supply scheme was a long standing requirement of the Kurunegala Municipal area and its suburbs. With this necessity being taken into consideration, measures were taken to provide the people in Kurunegala with solutions for the drinking water problem.
The sanitation facility will cater to the needs of households, government, private sector, schools, hospitals, tourist hotels, institutions and all of the daily floating population exceeding 100,000.
It was also cited that the rapid development of the Kurunegala city had led to a sewerage disposal problem where most septic tanks in households were not up to standard and leak into the environment. This has also led to the contamination of the Kurunegala lake due to contaminated underground water.
The project aims to provide safe drinking water, continuous, potable water for 24 hours, facilitating more than 100,000 floating population with 45,000 public in city limits and also to facilitate the General hospital of Kurunegala with 24 hours continuous water supply.
To would also provide the opportunity of disposing waste water for 3,500 domestic and commercial institutes through well organized sewerage network. The project is estimated to be valued at Rs. 15,500 million out of which, Rs. 3,200 million is funded by the government.
The construction of this project was completed by the China Machinery Engineering Company (CMEC), under the guidance of the Ministry of City Planning and Water Supply and the supervision of the Water Supply and Drainage Board.
