PARLIAMENT

PM to consult SLFP on upcoming PC elections: Speaker
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe would consult the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) and arrive at a decision on the upcoming Provincial Council (PC) elections this week, Speaker Karu Jayasuriya told Parliament yesterday.
Responding to Joint Opposition MP Dullas Alahapperuma, the Speaker said the topic had been discussed several times at party leaders’ meetings and that the Prime Minister had requested time to discuss it with the SLFP.
MP Alahapperuma questioned over the delay in moving the Delimitation Committee Report on provincial councils for debate in Parliament. He noted that the elections to three PCs had already been delayed for eight months and that the period of another three PCs were to expire within the next few months. He expressed doubts as to whether the government was deliberately postponing the PC elections. The Speaker said he had paid special attention to the matter, adding that the PM would arrive at a decision this week. State Finance Minister Eran Wickramaratne said that the UNP too, disagreed to postpone the elections.
‘Blue Summit Capital Management to buy ETI Finance’
Blue Summit Capital Management (Pte) Ltd was the new investor to buy ETI Finance, State Finance Minister Eran Wickramaratne said in Parliament, yesterday.
He was responding to a question raised by Chief Opposition Whip and JVP Leader Anura Kumara Dissanayake under Standing Order 27 (2). He said the new investor would be given time to muster a plan to settle deposit liabilities, and if they were to fail, the government would have to liquidate the company.
“ETI Finance will sell its shareholding in subsidiaries and investment properties for a net amount of USD 75 million. USD 32 million out of that sum had been received and 10 percent of money of the deposit holders will be paid from June 5 onward. Another 10 percent will be repaid by the end of June when the remainder, USD 43 million, has been received. The Director Board members of ETI Finance have been ordered to pay Rs. 1 billion to the company before June 15. In case the company was liquidated, depositors will be repaid the money to a maximum of Rs. 600,000 by the Central Bank Depositors’ Insurance,” he said.
The state minister admitted that the government would not be able to repay the money of the depositors in full, if the company had to be liquidated.
“There is a shortage of 30 to 35 percent, and it is general opinion that it is unfair to repay the amount using taxpayers’ money. In that case, the depositors will have to go before courts against the owners, but it would be a lengthy process. The Central Bank (CB) has ordered the company to present an action plan before June 15. We would have to give the new investor some time to see how it could bail out the company,” he added.
The state minister said Omar Siraj Qandeel and Rodrigo Don Cyril were the Director Board members of the Blue Summit Capital Management (Pte) Ltd to which several key ETI Group assets were to be sold.
He further said a tri-member committee comprised of former CB Assistant Governor S. S. Rathnayake, former Bank of Ceylon (BOC) DGM P. A. Lionel and former BOC AGM H. W. Thilakarathna, had been appointed to supervise the troubled ETI group. MP Dissanayake questioned the government’s plan to repay the money of 35,300 depositors of ETI totalling to Rs. 36 billion. He further requested a full-day debate on the troubled financial institutions in the country. Leader of the House Lakshman Kiriella agreed to the request.
‘Govt. has taken measures to assist flood victims’
The government had taken all necessary measures to provide dry rations to those who were affected by the inclement weather conditions prevailing in the country, while Rs. 10,000 would also be paid to enable flood victims to have their homes cleaned once the flood waters had receded, Irrigation and Water Resources and Disaster Management State Minister Palitha Range Bandara said in Parliament, yesterday.
The government had taken measures to provide boats to all affected districts, while measures had also been taken to provide 66 rafts to Ratnapura, the state minister added. He said they had been involved in providing relief to flood victims in the Puttalam district yesterday, while rafts and mechanised boats had been provided to assist affected persons in the Kalutara, Galle, Badulla, Gampaha, Matara, Colombo, Kegalle, Puttalam and Kurunegala districts.
“In addition to the 66 rafts already dispatched to Ratnapura, we have implemented a mechanism to provide an additional 26 rafts as well. We are issuing constant warnings and weather updates and have also taken measures to face any situation that may arise with the prevailing inclement weather over the next few days,” he said. Further, the army is currently on standby with 20 motors, in order to assist people in affected areas to clean their wells, once the situation improves.
Minister raises concerns over coal power plants
Finance and Mass Media State Minister Eran Wickramaratne yesterday in Parliament, voiced his concerns against opting for more coal power plants in the country.
Commencing the debate on several orders under the National Environment Act relating to the banning of polythene items and a Gazette notification to declare Waratenna-Hakkinda as an Environmental Protection Area, Wickramaratne said the opposition to coal power plants was justifiable.
He underlined that the officials and engineers at the Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) should take the responsibility of attempting to push for more coal power.
“What we have is a monopoly. If there had been other power suppliers, we could have resolved this issue more rationally. The CEB has a responsibility, and I urge them to take decisions while thinking of future generations. We need to give priority to generating power through clean energy,” he said. He added that coal powers plants were being closed down elsewhere in the world, including the US, Europe and Japan, and that they were shifting to renewable energy such as solar, wind and Liquid Natural Gas (LNG).
“People question the government’s policy of opting for more coal power plants in this scenario. It is a valid question. The pollution at the coal power plant we currently possess is a fact that cannot be disregarded, despite what we in the government or the CEB say. Puttalam residents complain against Norochcholai. We in Colombo receive the benefits from the power plant, whereas the villagers in Puttalam suffer the pollution it causes,” Wickramaratne said.
Weerawansa warned for misconduct
Speaker Karu Jayasuriya yesterday warned Joint Opposition MP Wimal Weerawansa not to disturb Parliament proceedings.
The Speaker’s warning came after MP Weerawansa demanded the microphone while the Speaker was making an announcement. MP Weerawansa was repeatedly demanding to raise a Point of Order.
‘Drought dwindled country’s crop yield by 30 percent’
The recent drought was the most severe catastrophe to affect the country during recent times; it reduced the country’s agricultural production by 30 percent, forcing the government to spend a large sum to import rice and other essential commodities. Further, the government had spent Rs. 38 million in drought relief payments to farmers who were affected, Agriculture Minister Mahinda Amaraweera said.
Commencing a debate on several orders under the National Environment Act relating to the banning of polythene items and a Gazette notification to declare Waratenna-Hakkinda as an Environmental Protection Area, Amaraweera said that despite the drought, the highest exports reported in the country’s history was achieved in 2017, earning an export revenue of over US$15 billion.
“We also succeeded in increasing our foreign reserves. But it was a great achievement to have been able to keep the cost of living at a low level. We managed to lift the ban on fish exports and record the highest fish exports during 2017,” he said.
The minister commended the media on the extent of flood reporting, adding that it was appreciated that the media had highlighted the areas that needed to be addressed, making it easier for the government to address the issues.
“The highest number of deaths due to the current inclement weather was due to lightning strikes. This was also due to people not adhering to warnings by the government. But we were able to keep the number of victims to a minimal due to the readiness of the government and the security forces.”
“We have also increased compensations. During the time I served in the previous government, compensation for the loss of life was a mere Rs. 15,000, but now, we it has been increased to 100,000. Previously compensation for the loss of a house was only Rs. 100,000, but we have currently increased that to Rs. 2.5 million for some cases. We assess the extent of damage prior to determining compensation,” Minister Amaraweera said.
Previously, the compensation paid to a fishermen who were lost at sea was only Rs. 100,000, but under the current government, it had been increased to Rs. 1 million. All those engaged in the fisheries sector had been protected by the said insurance scheme provided free-of-charge.
“We have also increased the insurance paid to farmers to Rs. 40,000 per hectare. Next year, 5,000 tanks will be renovated not only to assist agriculture, but to hold flood waters as well,” Amaraweera added.
Government project procedures, misguided: Bimal
Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) MP Bimal Rathnayake said orders had been issued under the National Environmental Act, but what was more important, was its implementation. Although the country had been experiencing floods during the past few years, the government had failed to provide basic disaster relief measures so far, he said.
“Boats have not been provided to certain areas. There are certain areas that are prone to flooding even during a minor downpour, yet district secretaries of those areas do not possess boats to be used during such a situation. The government makes comments regarding landslides only when they occur. They are sending SMS alerts and warnings, but nothing is being done to evacuate the people at risk,” he added.
Rathnayake made these comments during a debate on several orders and the Environmental Act relating to the ban on polythene and forest reserves in Parliament, yesterday.
Focussing on the Port City project, Rathnayake said 16 million cubes of stones were required for the project, adding that it had created environmental issues.
“When this government came into power, they stopped the project, claiming that it lacked a proper environmental assessment report. But now, it is in progress and there are 12 quarries within a limited area that are supplying the stones required for the project, violating all permit specifications,” he said.
“The government is following a wrong formula and thinks that trees could be cut, forests destroyed and rains could be induced using modern technology. The blue-green economy is currently in the process of destroying the only mountain range in the Colombo district. According to the specifications stipulated on the permits issued to stone quarries, only 55 tipper loads can be issued per day, but currently, there are over 200 tipper loads of stones being obtained per day,” the MP said.
Rathnayake added that the Wilpattu National Park should be protected from those who are destroying it while hiding behind racial claims.
“We are against this. There are others who are ignoring the issues in their districts and raising issues about Wilpattu in an attempt to ignite racial tension. However, it is a fact that there is environmental damage being done to the Wilpattu National Park,” he said.
“Even those who had not lost their lands had been provided lands at Wilpattu; this was stated in the Audit Report. Around 650 hectares had been cleared within the Wilpattu National Park, where 169 houses had been constructed. However, less than 10 percent of the said persons are currently living there,” Rathnayake added.
Parliament nod for polythene ban
Parliament yesterday approved orders under the National Environment Act relating to the ban on polythene items which came into force in January, this year.
Several Gazettes Extraordinary issued by President Maithripala Sirisena, in his capacity as the Mahaweli Development and Environment Minister on September 1, 2017, were approved in Parliament following a full-day debate.
Gazettes Extraordinary prohibit “manufacture, sale, offer for sale, offer free-of-charge, exhibition or use” of polythene or any polythene product that are 20 microns or below, lunch sheets, grocery bags, food containers (lunch boxes), plates, cups, and spoons from expanded polystyrene.
They also prohibit the use of all forms of polythene for “decorative purposes” at “political, social, religious, national, cultural or any other event or occasion.” Furthermore, open-burning of refuse and other combustible materials inclusive of plastics, had also been prohibited. Parliament also approved another Gazette Extraordinary to declare Warathenna-Hakkinda in Kandy containing 59.4 hectares, as an Environmental Protection Area.
Illegal forest-clearing continues unabated in North: Devananda
Illegal forest-clearing is being carried out at an alarming rate in the North, but authorities have failed to take action in order to prevent it, United People’s Freedom Alliance (UPFA) MP Douglas Devananda alleged in Parliament, yesterday.
Forwarding a question under the Standing Order 27 (2) to President Maithripala Sirisena, who was the subject Environment Minister, MP Devananda said forest lands in Vavuniya, Mannar and Mullaitivu were depleting because of the illegal felling of trees.
He said it had aggravated the water scarcity in the area, adding that residents had complained that public officials, who should have taken action against the offenders of such illegal activities, were supporting them. He urged to implement the law against such offenders and to take immediate measures to protest the clearing of forest lands in the North. Chief Government Whip Gayantha Karunathilaka, replying to the question on behalf of the President and the government, said circulars had been issued to curtail illegal forest-clearing in the North and that orders had been given to not release any land without the approval of the National Committee.
Reading out the answer sent from the Environment Ministry, Karunathilaka further said the Forest Conservation Department and Air Force were jointly conducting aerial surveillance to monitor the activities taking place in forests in the North. He said a flying squad had also been set up for special raids. Referring to the statistics, the minister said 40 incidents of land-grabbing and 58 illegal felling of trees had been reported in forest lands in Vavuniya, while seven incidents of land-grabbing and 42 incidents of illegal felling of trees had been reported in forest lands in Mannar, last year.
‘Rajapaksas should reveal US citizenship renunciation documents’
Former Defence Secretary Gotabhaya Rajapaksa and former Minister Basil Rajapaksa should reveal as to whether they had applied to cancel their US citizenships, UNP backbench MP Prof. Ashu Marasinghe said. Speaking at a debate in Parliament yesterday, the MP pointed out that the citizenship cancellation process was complex in the US, and that it could take about six months to two years.
“Before giving hopes on contesting for future elections, they should notify the country as to whether they have applied to cancel their US citizenships,” he said. He made these comments with reference to the Viyath Maga campaign of the former Defence Secretary. Dual citizens are disqualified from contesting the elections as per the prevailing law.
