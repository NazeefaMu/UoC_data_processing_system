Necessary arrangements  for JO ‘Janabalaya’ rally

With the Joint Opposition (JO) yet remaining secretive about the venue and the path for today’s ‘Janabalaya’ rally, the Police will focus on three main areas in Colombo city, Police sources said.
Holding a meeting at the Police Field Force Headquarters last evening, a decision was made by Police top brass to take necessary security precautions and implement a traffic management plan surrounding the Galle Face, Town Hall and Colombo Fort areas.
“We speculate that protest may spread to these areas and therefore will take the necessary precautions to lessen its impact on the public,” a top Police source said.
According to him, the Police will also focus on the Campbell Park and the Lalith Athulathmudali ground in Kirulapone.
“We believe they may be used as meeting places prior to commence their protest march and rally,” Police sources said.
He also confirmed that no official information has been provided to the Police regarding today’s Joint Opposition rally.
IGP Pujith Jayasundara on Monday claimed that necessary precautions are being taken to maintain law and order within the city during the ‘Janabalaya’ rally.
“Special arrangements have been made to provide additional security to Parliament and other places of importance in Colombo and the surrounding areas,” he said, adding that additional intelligence officers and riot squads will be on standby as well. Meanwhile, the Police made three attempts yesterday to obtain injunctions against today’s rally, but, were however turned down by the respective courts. Accordingly, the Cinnamon Gardens Police attempted to obtain an injunction order against the rally claiming that the JO were planning to surround the Official residence of the President located on Malalasekara Mawatha and they had obtained intelligence reports to that effect.
The Welikada and Kollupitiya Police stations also made similar requests from the Colombo Additional Magistrate which were denied while the Colombo Chief Magistrate also denied the request made by the Cinnamon Gardens Police.
