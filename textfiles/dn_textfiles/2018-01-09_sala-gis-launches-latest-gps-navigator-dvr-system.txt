“What we programmed for use in this new device is a map of Sri Lanka developed by our own Company. It is an offline map, not an online map. This means that our offline map is operative in any part of Sri Lanka under any weather conditions at any time via satellite technology. This map does not need cellular network signals for operational purposes. We have already programmed around 300,000 Points of address, almost all the roads and landmarks into this map. In addition, we have also fed into it the numbers of residences and telephone numbers of all leading business establishments and government institutions.
We update the map every three months by adding thousands of more new routes and landmarks. The new updated map is given to our customers free of charge. The map guide drivers to reach any destination within the shortest possible time without any hassle or inconvenience”, Chinthaka Wijewickrama explained.

There is no other device in the market so far that can parallel the GPS Navigation System we introduced. No sooner the name of a road, telephone number of a business institution or a landmark is keyed into the system, the relevant route to reach the destination swiftly is indicated on the display.’’
