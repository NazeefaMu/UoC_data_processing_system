Paper delayed say parents: No delay say authorities

Parents of grade five scholarship candidates at the Paranagama Central College, Jambugahapitiya examination center attached to the Wattegama Zonal Education office staged a protest yesterday against the delay in distribution of first question paper of the grade five scholarship examination.
Parents also alleged that an injustice was caused on their children as invigilators at the exam center have collected the papers prior to the scheduled closing time.
Central Province Education Director Thilak Ekanayake said that allegations of the parents are unacceptable and baseless as there was no delay in the process of distribution and early collection of question papers which has been supervised by a Zonal Education Officer in Wattegama.
