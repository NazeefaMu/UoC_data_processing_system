How to Commercialise your Innovation?: What is Commercialising Innovation?

An innovation can be defined in various ways. Most commonly it is known as an intellectual creation new to the world or an edition of a present creation.
Therefore, innovation is not only a discovery, but also a human contribution to increase productivity of an existing asset or a methodology. Hence, innovations are the novel products of human intellectual endeavour.Commercialising innovation can be done by either individuals ororganisations to market and promote their innovations for a commercial benefit.
Presently, mostinnovations are commercialised through new business models. For instance,innovators of widespread games like ‘Minecraft’ and ‘Second Life’ in the game industry and ‘Netflix’ in the entertainment industry, have commercialised their products via new business models through the internet.
Furthermore, commercialising an innovation is adding a value to an intellectual creation by converting it in to a consumable good or a service. When commercialising innovation, although it is important,to examine: political, economic, social, technical, ethical and legal factors, only legal factors are discussed in this article. The control of Intellectual Property (IP) means the rules and regulations provided in the realm of IP law to enforce one’s rights when it is infringed or likely to be infringed. In terms of such enforcements which can protect innovations, this article describes mainly the patents and copyrights.
IP law could use to protect the innovation from unauthorised commercial use of others. The rationale behind this control is, it is unfair if there is an open opportunity for third parties to exploit an innovation created by using the inventor’sresources and receive a commercial advantage without remitting any royalty to the inventor.
Therefore, the control of IP in commercialising innovation has become a reward for encouraging innovators. IP law supports not only the domestic level of transactions, but also the international trade by protecting innovations when infringed. For instance, if imported products of X is similar to the patented products of Y, then latter is entitled to bring a law suit against former if the import was unauthorised.
The control of IP could exercise not only to protect against the infringements, but also to seek declaration orders from court justifying ongoing commercial exploitation of innovation. This article discusses commercialising innovation in the realm of, patents and copyrights. Patentsconsider the novelty while the copyrightsfocus the originality.Both of these rights are important in commercialising new business models today. The word ‘control’ in terms of IP law, is referred to the monopoly which can be either absolute or limited.Hence, in considering the issues in commercialising innovations, it is important to investigate whether such monopolies can be maintained efficiently and effectively to support emerging new business models.The control of IP over an innovation can be discussed under two important areas; commercialising patents and copyrights.
Commercialising Patents
Nowadays, commercialising patents has become an integrated trade practice which brings commercial advantages in the world. For example, if a person invents a machine which can count the cash notes and simultaneously remove the dust and bacteria on cash notes to avoid health hazards to cashier, it could become popular because it could improve the health and safety condition of the business. Hence, the owner can commercialise this product domestically and Internationally.
In order to commercialise it, he can create a licensing system through an IP contract which is strengthened by registering a patent for his innovation. In case if a patent is a subject matter of a business contract, even if the contract is terminated, the rights remain until the patent is expired. Sometimes courts have given additional protection even during the patent pending stages considering the status of the patent. In Global Flood Defence Systems Ltd v Van Den Noort Innovations BV,court had given an opportunity to enforce rights of a defendant who acquired the patentduring the court proceedings before the trial date.
Although patents are granted for twenty years, there is a special advantage if the creation is a medical or plant protection product if a Supplementary Protection Certificate (SPC) is obtained. Therefore, the innovators in such production areas are encouraged as they have an extended protection which increases their confidence in commercialising the innovations.
When considering about patents in commercialising innovation, according to the agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS), not only the products but also the processes can be protected by granting exclusive rights to the owner to avoid unauthorised commercial benefits going to others.Thus,number of modern innovative business models which consists either methods or processes can be protected under the umbrella of this agreement.
Apart from the protection mechanisms, the owner has an exclusive right to gain any commercial benefit by defining licensing system for the creation.When making a mercantile contract, many companies are interested whether the subject matter is patented or not.
Therefore, if the innovation is patented, a substantial confidence is generated between parties to proceed towards further business opportunities. In the modern context, it is visible that most of the innovations are industrial applications where the owner could seek the statutory protection if it is an invention and certain inventive steps were being followed. Ifinnovators fulfil those requirements, they are entitled to commercialise their innovation in more protective mechanism which consequently increase the profit of the business.
Commercialising Copyrights
Although the copyright is not a registered right, it is visible that many court actions are filed to strengthen it. For instance, in the music industry, massive number of cases have been filed for seeking protection. Today, there is a continuous trend of increasing number of computer software, which can be protected in copyright law under literary, dramatic and musical works.‘Linden Lab’a company who is the innovator of ‘Second Life’ and ‘Blocks World’ have used the control of IP, to deliver non-exclusive rights to the users subject to conditions.
In order to commercialise their products, they have been introducing a revocable license which allow users to receive the facilities provided in a virtual game which is developed by them. The ‘Mojang Minecraft’ end user license agreement contains provisions to avoid users from commercial benefits.
However, it is an important fact to remember such type of commercialisations are subject to exceptions in terms of educational purposes.
Furthermore, you can use the statutory mechanisms provided in the law of copyrightto protect yourrights. The most important facility provided in IP law is the opportunity to assign copyright by licensing agreement. Such licensing methods can beexecuted even with the permission of sub-licensing as well. In addition, charging a royalty fee is available as an option in commercialising innovations. For example, copyright owner can outsource the publishing work and generate royalty payments from it.
Issues You May Face
When commercialising your innovation, you may face number of issues such as, (1) Poor Utilization of Intellectual Property, (2) Lack of Protection for New Business Models and (3) Impact of Inharmonious Interpretations.
 Poor Utilization of Intellectual Property
When considering the contemporary issues in the regime of commercialising innovations, it can be argued that there is an impact of unbalanced control over the innovations. In other words,both less control and too much control over an innovation have become important issues in the industry.When discussing about the poor control of copy righta sound example is databases. Although ‘EuropeanDatabase Directives’ introduced the database laws there are four main elements to prove when claiming protection as such as, independence of the constituent elements, systematic arrangement of data in a methodical way, opportunity for the individual accessibility and intellectual creation in the selection and the arrangement of the content.
This had excluded the contents of a database. The protection provided at presentonly covers the infringement of the selection and the arrangement of the data. Therefore, most of the existing databases do not deserve the protection.Another issue is the exclusion of the commercially valuable or expensively created software from copyright protection for databases.Moreover,according to compulsory licensing method, the right to charge a payment from the licensee can be deprived on the grounds of unfair terms in the license.
Therefore, the protection can be misused by third parties like ‘Patent Trolls’ for their financial benefits.The doubt in question is whether the actual objective intended by the legislature is achieved by the patent law.
The disadvantage of these Trolls is,instead of the objective of protecting the innovationthey proceed in the aim of generating income through the law suits against Small and Medium Enterprises (SME).Although the patent is a good method of protecting, sometimes maintaining a patent is considerably strict.
In a hypothetical scenario, if the applicant of a patent had not commercialised the patented product over the last three years, he is prevented from enjoying the exclusive rights on it as the patent could be granted to a third-party applicant.Hence, if the innovator rushed in filing the patent application and if he lost the patent right due to non-exploitation of the innovation within three years, there is an issue because the invention is already in the public domain.
Lack of Protection for New Business Models
Most of modern innovations are backed by software. If a person creates a new business model which itself a software, the available remedy for him is to seek copyright protection instead of patent. Hence, most of the businesses methods are excluded from patentability.
Although copyright is available for the realm of software, the protection given is considerably weaker thanpatents.In order to prove the copyright for a new business model with a web based information system, the domain registration and data uploaded dates are considered for the moment. Practically it is difficult to prove the first published date and the version, because the web sites are frequently updated.
A third party can simply copy your business model and software system, and upload the data to his existing web page under existing domain name. Consequently, even as the originator you may fail in proving the real uploaded date. Hence, the application of copyright to modern business models based on internet have becomemore complex.
Although we can apply and obtain design rights, it is impossible to maintain an absolute monopoly over the innovation compared to the patents. In the case of Aerotel Ltd v Telco Holdings Ltd ,court decided thata business model based on telephone operating software system was not patentable under the European Patent Convention. Furthermore, the line of reasoning was reinforced in AT&Tcase, where the court had applied the same rule with respect to software based business models and decided that a digital media hosting service was not patentable.
Impact of InharmoniousInterpretations
There are number of interpretation issues in domestic and the international level IP disputes. For instance,theIntellectual Property Act 2003 of Sri Lanka and the Patent Act 1977 of UK require an inventor to demonstrate inventive stepsand the invention should not be obvious to a person skilled in the art.
This has become an important issue of interpretation. In the case of Hallen Co. and Anr. v Brabantia (UK) Ltd,court has developed atest to interpret the word ‘obvious’ to overcome such issues. According to this new test the word ‘obvious’ in the inventive stepsshould be interpreted depending on the facts of each case. In Aerotel Ltd v Telco Holdings Ltd,court held that it is difficult in interpreting what are excluded from patentability.
When considering the application of IP control, it is visible that substantially different interpretations are given to the terms in statutes. Sometimes the disharmony between different jurisdictionsmaydiscourage the innovators.
Although there are number of international treaties in the realm of IP to allow priority in all signatory states from single application those treaties arelackinga sound international terminologyfor IP.
How to Overcome the Issues?
To avoid the above discussed issues, several solutions may besupportive such as (1) Exercise aBalance Control of IP, (2) Apply Strategic Control of IP and(3) Support Development ofIP laws for New Business Models.
Exercising a Balance Control of IP
Having a balancedcontrol is the solution. For instance, a multinational companywhichhasbusiness around the world have to use a balance level of patent protection tostrengthen both international and domestic trade.Otherwise, when such companiespromotetheirproducts worldwide there may be issues of infringements of IPR in domestic markets which they are selling to.
According to Gower’s review of IP in 2005, balance control was one key recommendation among other things to avoid issues in commercialising innovation. An absolute or limited monopoly should be balanced properly to provide an efficient and effective foundation for the enforcement of IP in commercialising innovation. In order to enhance the realm of science and technology, the Royal Society of UK has suggested to utilize the IP laws in a balance manner to motivate the innovators.For instance, Samsung Electronics had successfully appropriated IPR, which ordered Apple, to publish a non-infringement notice on their official web site. When considering the enforcement method, sometimes companies trying to protect their innovation by sending threatening letters. Nonetheless, courts have a negative feedback about these type of notices as held inGoldenEye (International) Ltd v Telefonica UK Ltd.
As an innovator, you may be interested aboutfunding and therefore, may disclose the invention and inventive steps to a foreign party through documentation or prototype. Even if the funding is granted or not, such party may copy and reproduce your innovation and subsequently, claim ownership in their country because IPR are only national rights. Such risks could be minimised by preparing a Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA) before disclosing details of your innovation. Therefore, striking a balance control and enforcement is necessary to protect your innovation.
Application of Strategic Control of IP
In order to, avoid losing the patent because of non-exploitation, the innovator should have a strategic IP plan to identify the potential threats during the first few years from the date which the patent was granted. In some cases, innovators could use several IPR as a strategy. For example, although Viagra patent has expired in 2013, the trademark protection is still in place. Hence, if an innovation is absorbing a great amount of commercial revenue in the industry, a strategic IP solution may be applied. Therefore, a demanding product can be protected by both patent and trademark simultaneously to strengthen the protection.
While applying strategic control of IP, it is necessary to obtain advices from trained individuals and organisations which have the expertise and knowledge in commercialising innovation. Such experts can support to improve the effectiveness of commercialising your products or services, by directing and facilitating a tailored approach.
For instance, you may obtain advices from the experts at National Intellectual Property Office and Sri Lanka Inventors Commission (SLIC) before commercialising your innovation. In the UK, Technology Strategy Board (Innovate UK) and IP Office provide expert advices to new innovators about how to commercialise their innovation to gain a competitive advantage. Having more digital copyright exchanges is another solution to avoid issues. In such system, the sharing of licenses can be done considerably much effective.
When considering the strategic control of IP, choice of the dispute resolution method has also become vital. If you think the court proceedings may time consuming and placing your innovation in public domain, you may select either arbitration or negotiation as an Alternative Dispute Resolution method (ADR) to solve disputes arise when commercialising your innovation. Such ADR methods could avoid the above discussed issue of unbalanced control, and ultimately improve the efficiency and effectiveness of a commercialising plan and the Return on Investment (ROI) of the innovation.
Support Development of IP Laws for New Business Models
This requires public, private, and international partnership. Through such cooperation, domestic laws or international treaties may be formulated to protect and commercialise new business models.For instance, there are sui generis laws created for semiconductor topography, plant breeders’ rights and data base rights. Another sound example issui generis data base law which had contributed enormously to the companies in European Economic Area (EEA) for the protection of their new investments in databases.
An innovator who substantially invests in creating a database is now protected under the said sui generis data base law. However, the sui generis database law does not adequately treat all the circumstances. For example, in the case of British Horseracing Board v William Hill a database was excluded from the protection of the sui generisdatabase law due to lack of independent material.
Furthermore, it is important to introduce sui generis law for computer or web based business models. Although the TRIPS agreement covers the copyright protection for computer programs and compilation of data,it is not sufficient to protect new computer generated business methods and solutions. Why cannot patents be granted to the new business models based on software?
The software should be permitted to be patented if they are commercially valuable and expensively created or if they are novel inventions. Taking a photograph or writing a poem is different from creating a new business model. If a new business model is asoftware, it should be granted a patent because it is aninnovation. An information system like ‘Minecraft’ is not just an expression, it is a functioning complex business model.
Therefore, a new sui generis patent law can be introduced in the realm of technological business models because they are novel and innovative. On top of that, it is necessary to introduce IP laws to cover the embedded software in devices. If the protection has been allocated for semi conductors then why cannot a sui generis law be created for software stored in a system? It is possible to expand the scope of IP law by introducing new rights to govern new innovations. There is process known as‘emulation’ defined as a creation of a new and distinct right by analogy drawn eclectically from the types already known.Therefore, it is possible to introduce new sui generis law for software based new business models.
Summary
Commercialising innovation is correlated with the realm of IP law. In order to have a better convenience in domestic and international trade, you have to exercise a balanced control of IP. In creating such balance, it is significant to have a positive contribution not only from you as an innovator, but also from the legislators. Having less control or too much control over an innovation by the innovator is harmful for any entity when commercialising innovation.
Thus, an application of a well administered and managed strategic control of IP, could positively support in commercialising innovation considerably much more effective than conventional approaches. Finally, after a careful analysis of above arguments, issues and solutions, you may formulatea better approach to effectively commercialise your innovation.
