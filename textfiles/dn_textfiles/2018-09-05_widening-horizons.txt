widening Horizons

The English Language Teaching Unit (ELTU) of the University of Sri Jayewardenepura was established concurrently with the first ever faculty “Faculty of Arts” of the Vidoydaya University in 1958. Having realized the importance of English in higher education, the founder of the university, Ven. Walivitiye Soratha Thera made English a compulsory language for undergraduates.
It is remarkable that when the University celebrates the 60th Anniversary in 2018, the ELTU was bestowed the Departmental status under the headship of Sarath Ananda. At present, the Department of English Language Teaching (DELT) is in charge of improving the English language proficiency of students in the Faculty of Humanities and Social Sciences, the Faculty of Applied Sciences, the Faculty of Technology and the Faculty of Engineering of the University of Sri Jayewardenepura. Initially, a two-year English language programme was offered to the students of the Faculty of Arts. Different individuals including heads of the unit have contributed to the progress of the ELTU in the past. Senior Professor Rajiva Wijesinha’s role and the role played by Parvathi Nagasundaram in the development of English in the University of Sri Jayewardenepura cannot be overlooked. They rendered a great service to develop the English language teaching in the university.
Lack of interaction
The number one challenge for the undergraduates of Sri Lanka, particularly the undergraduates of humanities and social sciences faculties of Sri Lankan universities is the English skill. One of the reasons for this is that English is mostly taught as a subject, not as a real-world language. When English is taught as a subject, students just come and listen to the teacher, write down the note and leave the classroom. No interaction takes place. To learn a language, one has to see the value of it, hear it in the day to day situations and use it as he or she can.
The Department of English Language Teaching (DELT) of the University of Sri Jayewardenepura has taken initiatives to shift the paradigm and teach English as a real-world language that is used for day to day communication. Having realized this problem, Madhubashini Disanayaka Rathnayaka who became the Head of the ELTU in 2013, a new course was introduced to the Faculty of Humanities and Social Sciences giving an unprecedented amount of time for input in English for first-year students i.e.300 hours per year and for the first time, the course was made a credit-bearing course. In this course, students have compulsory English from 8.00 a.m. – 10.00 a.m. every weekday.
The course was introduced with several objectives in mind. The overall objective of this programme was to enhance students’ knowledge of English through the development of their reading, writing, listening and speaking skills. Consequently, students’ confidence to use the language competently is heightened eliminating any hesitation or fear towards English. This is approached through the integration of a variety of exciting group-based activities such as drama, singing, library sessions, poster presentations, PowerPoint presentation, learning management systems (LMS) etc. In addition to the traditional face to face teaching, learning and assessment methods, the DELT uses modern technology such as blended learning in the process of language learning and assessment. In the DELT, students are expected to come and watch the news on BBC or CNN and report the main ideas to the class the next day. The development of teamwork, leadership, decision making, time management, organization skills, confidence building, planning and presentation skills which can be identified as key characteristics to be employed in present day world are all involved in these group-based activities.
Sound knowledge
The students who successfully complete the compulsory English programme are expected to have gained a sound knowledge of the structures of the English language as well as be competent in communicating in English. Thus, they will be more desirable candidates for the corporate sector.
The course was further developed under the leadership of the outgoing head, Sarath Ananda with the support of a group of versatile teaching staff consisting of eight permanent lecturers and more than 25 visiting lecturers all with postgraduate qualifications in teaching English as a second language. The DELT also has a dedicated team of non-academic staff.
The DELT offers English proficiency courses to the students of the Faculty of Applied Sciences, Faculty of Engineering and Faculty of Technology too. These courses are geared to help students deal with any language problem they come across when they follow their courses in the English medium in their respective Faculties.
In addition to the compulsory English programme, the DELT offers an optional certificate course in English for the second year students of the Faculty of Humanities and Social Sciences. The plans are underway to introduce a Diploma in English for those who successfully complete this Certificate Course in English thus enabling the students of the University of Sri Jayewardenepura to graduate with a Degree in a discipline they desire along with a Diploma in English.
The Department extends its further services to the external students who cannot enter the university and offers a highly successful weekend Certificate Course in English and a Diploma Course in English to school leavers, public officers and private sector individuals.
Leadership and management
English Language Society (ELS) of the DELT is a student body mainly run by the first year students of the Faculty of Humanities and Social Sciences. Its members are interested in popularizing the English language among the members through communication, creativity, leadership and management. Hence, the members organize various activities and projects to showcase the ability and the skills of the members. The English Day is organized annually by the first year students of the English Language Society. The objective of these events is to create a platform for the students to use English in more or less in a natural manner.
The Department of English Language Teaching celebrated the transition of becoming a Department under my present leadership recently.
The ultimate objective of the DELT is to give all the students a fair chance to compete with everyone out there in the job market by providing students of the University of Sri Jayewardenepura with the ability to function in English in day-to-day situations, developing confidence in the students with regard to using English. Therefore, the DELT of the University of Sri Jayewardenepura extends its fullest cooperation to produce a global graduate who can successfully meet the global challenges using an excellent command of English while being proud of his or her own culture and language.
