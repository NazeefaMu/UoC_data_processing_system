I meant no harm to journalist, says John

‘Complaint to HRC baseless’:
Tourism and Christian Affairs Minister John Amaratunga yesterday reiterated his claim that he meant no harm to Ja-ela journalist Bennet Ferdinandez and that his complaint to the Human Rights Council (HRC) was baseless.
On June 8, the Minister of Tourism Development and Christian Affairs had allegedly threatened the journalist when he was questioned over the issue of dumping garbage in Muthurajawela.
The journalist had lodged a complaint against the Minister for having threatened his life at the Peliyagoda Police, the very same day. On Tuesday (13), he had proceeded to file a petition with the Sri Lankan Human Rights Commission over the very same issue.
“I did not invite the media to cover the discussion at my home.I wanted to resolve this with the people in electorate in an amicable manner. The media is insinuating that I asked people to dump garbage there and that is false. There is a gazette from the President directing that garbage be dumped there as Meethotamulla cannot be used anymore,” Amaratunga said.
The Minister was addressing a media briefing at Sirikotha yesterday.
He added that he did not want to respond to the journalist’s questions as he thought the former was trying to stir up more trouble on the matter.
“My patience is limited. I did not want to scold him but he provoked me. I did not threaten him but I did use some foul language and I am sorry for that,” the minister said.
Amaratunga further explained that the journalist had no need to go to the HRC as no harm had been done to him.
“We are all aware that certain people blow up such incidents out of proportion to be able to seek asylum out of the country at a later date,” the minister alleged as he went on to explain that the media needed to behave with more decorum.
The journalist had been a regular correspondent from the area and well known to the Minister. He had also been covering the event for over an hour prior to the Minister’s outburst. “I know what he is like and I don’t like his actions,” Minister Amaratunga.
