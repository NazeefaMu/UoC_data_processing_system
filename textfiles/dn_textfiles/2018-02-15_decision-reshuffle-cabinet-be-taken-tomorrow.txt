Decision to reshuffle Cabinet to be taken tomorrow

 
Cabinet co-spokesperson, Minister Rajitha Senaratne said that the decision to reshuffle the Cabinet will be taken tomorrow.
Addressing the weekly cabinet media briefing today, he said that the two main constituents of the government decided to go ahead with the 2015 mandate of the unity government whilst agreeing to a cabinet reshuffle.
The current crisis was triggered in the aftermath of last week’s local government elections which saw the UNP only securing 33 percent of the vote and the SLFP together with the UPFA 13 percent of the overall vote.
