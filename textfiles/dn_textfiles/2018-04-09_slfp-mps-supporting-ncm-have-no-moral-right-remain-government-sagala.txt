SLFP MPs supporting NCM have no moral right to remain in government: Sagala

Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) parliamentarians who supported the Joint Opposition (JO) sponsored No Confidence Motion (|NCM) had no moral right to remain in the government ranks anymore, Project Management, Youth Affairs and Southern Development Minister Sagala Ratnayake said.
He was addressing the gathering after handing over a newly built house to Kamal Priyantha and his family of Siyambalagoda, Pitabeddara. Kamal lost his house due to floods recently.
The house was built with contributions from the Sri Lanka Police Seva Vanitha Unit and members of the Community Police Committees in the area.
Minister Ratnayake said Members of Parliament made a correct and bold decision on April 4 to defeat the NCM brought against the Prime Minister and the government.
“When the two parties in the Yahapalana government worked hard to defeat the motion, a section of SLFP parliamentarians supported the motion. Although people were questioning the government’s stand on SLFP members who supported the motion, the more relevant question was whether those members had the moral right to remain in the government any longer,” the Minister said.
Ratnayake said a majority of SLFP MPs who supported the motion were those who entered Parliament through the national list.
“The UNP on its part had announced the party reorganisation work beforehand. The reorganisation should be done according to future needs. The past three years were spent on planning development work for the country. The ensuing two years would be devoted to implementation and action,” the Minister said.
“The government’s sole objective was to ensure a better future for the country and its people. Unless this was done, they would not be accepted by the people at the next elections,” the Minister said.
