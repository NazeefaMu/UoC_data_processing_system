Vinotherapy

Grape..er great news! Red wine has been known to be a certified stress buster. Anyone who has quaffed down a sip or more can vouch for it. But apparently wine residue — pips and pulp — too has beauty benefits. A reason why vinotherapy is taking Europe by storm. Dating back to the ancient Romans, it’s a beauty therapy where wine-making residue is rubbed into the skin. It is said to have exfoliating qualities and helps reduce ageing.
The actual therapy involves a body scrub, massage or even a soak in a mixture of red wine infused with its byproducts like grape skin, seeds and vine branches. Many beauty brands too now use grapeseed oil or grape extract. But is vinotherapy good for you? Dermatologist Dr Sumit Gupta is not convinced: “At the most wine can help in terms of wellness but in terms of skin beautification there isn’t any sort of demonstrable biological advantage of it. Whatever good things wine has, a grape juice has it too.
Maybe vinotherapy is just a touristy attraction. Gupta warns about following anything age-old at face value. While using wine byproducts get a pass, using actual wine on skin doesn’t. Gupta adds, “Any alcohol containing solution applied on the skin can have harmful effects. It can lead to dryness or reactivate any underlying skin disorder.” For now, maybe just stick to sipping the wine!
