Australia funds tourism sector development

Australia will provide around Rs. 1.6 billion in aid and technical assistance to strengthen Sri Lanka’s tourism sector – through training and mentoring for employees and small businesses.
Australian High Commissioner Bryce Hutchesson launched the Skills for Inclusive Growth Programme with Minister for Skills Development and Vocational Training Mahinda Samarasinghe in this regard on Wednesday.
This programme will help Sri Lanka develop a highly-skilled labour force to take its rightful place as a premier tourist destination.
“Australia understands tourism. It is one of our most important exports. We also understand skills development. We have a world-class education system and one of the world’s best vocational training systems,” Hutchesson said.
The programm will benefit local communities and businesses with an initial focus in Ampara, Batticaloa, Trincomalee and Polonnaruwa districts. It will prioritise the underemployed, particularly local women, youth and people with a disability.
It will support the full value chain of the tourism sector – for example, food suppliers, hospitality trainers, artisans, surf instructors, spa owners, accommodation providers, taxi drivers – as well as district planners, park rangers, industry regulators and business chambers.
