Twelve activists who are engaging in a Sathyagraha campaign against the South Asian Institute of Technology and Medicine (SAITM), opposite the Fort Railway Station yesterday gave an undertaking before Colombo Fort Magistrate to remove a stage erected on a land belonging to the Railways Department by Wednesday.
On June 26, the Fort Magistrate issued an order directing 12 activists to take steps to remove the platform of the protesters set up opposite the Fort Railway Station.
Deputy Inspector General of Police Ajith Rohana appearing for Fort police complained that the respondents were yet to remove the stage despite a court order to do so.
However, counsel Nuwan Bopage appearing for the respondents gave an undertaking to remove the stage by July 5.
Colombo Fort Magistrate Lanka Jayaratne directed the respondents to maintain public peace without causing disturbance to the people in the vicinity of the Fort Railway Station.
Twelve persons, including Dr. Hemantha de Silva, the Chairman of the Parents’ Union were named as respondents in this case.
