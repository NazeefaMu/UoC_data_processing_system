Vehicle misusing: Wimal passes the buck to officials

Former Minister Wimal Weerawansa has said officials should have decided whether his decision was right or wrong, Deputy Minister Ajith P. Perera said.
‘It is true that I gave this order, but the officials should have known whether it was the right directive to follow,' Deputy Minister Ajith P. Perera said as he revealed the admission made by Construction, Engineering Services, Housing and Common Amenities former Minister Wimal Weerawansa to the police on the case of misusing 40 vehicles. The former minister was arrested by the FCID on Tuesday for misusing vehicle amounting to a loss of Rs. 90 million to the government. The deputy minister who read out the B report in the case at the weekly cabinet briefing on Wednesday said the misuse of vehicles was an example of the massive corruption and misuse of state resources indulged in by the previous regime.
“The General Manager released the vehicle under the orders of the minister and now, he says this. According to the report, most of these vehicles were given to his relatives," he said.
Perera said the government had no desire to pursue personal agendas against anyone. All should be treated equally under the law, he said.
