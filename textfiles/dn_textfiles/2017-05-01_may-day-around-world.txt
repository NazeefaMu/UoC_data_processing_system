May  Day around the world

Isn't it strange that until the 19th century May Day meant maypoles, flowers, grass, picnics and welcoming the spring in countries like the United Kingdom, and nothing at all to people like us in Asian countries. In sharp contrast today, May 1st is a day of worker solidarity and protest; of speech-making, parading, brickbats, and conscientious violence almost all over the world.
China, the Philippines, France, Russia, Kenya, Brazil and Sri Lanka are just a sampling of the over 80 countries around the world who honor their workers on May 1, also known as International Workers' Day. The day has its origins in the movement for the 8-hour work day which largely took place in Chicago at the end of the 19th century. The first May Day was in 1886 when more than 300,000 workers across the U.S. walked out of their jobs in protest and began several days of protest and conflict with the police which would culminate at Haymarket Square in Chicago on May 4, 1886. On that day, many people - including many German immigrants had gathered at the marketplace to show support for the workers striking for an 8-hour workday when a bomb exploded, killing a policeman, and leading to gunfire that killed several people in the crowd, in addition to many injuries. So as not to evoke the memory of the riots and violence of this week in May in Chicago, President Grover Cleveland moved the official celebration of Labor Day to September in 1887 in the US.

The story obviously did not end there. If it did the whole world will be celebrating Workers' Day in September or never at all. But thankfully, a few years after the Haymarket Affair, some labor parties in Europe took up the cause to commemorate the Haymarket Martyrs and carry the fight for the 8 hour workday. In 1889, the International Socialist Conference declared May Day as the commemorative celebration it is known as in most of the world today.
Since then, around the world, May 1st has remained a day on which workers are given the day off and labor groups organize for protests and celebrations of the worker.
Global celebration
Over the past century, International Workers' Day has become a global celebration of union rights and a dedicated day for workers' rights activism. Today, celebrating this day of international action provides a chance both to give thanks for the groundbreaking work that has already been done for global workers' rights and for recognizing the work still left to be done.
In recent times, global worker's day celebrations saw mostly peaceful protests. In Jakarta, Indonesia, thousands of union members marched for improved working conditions. In Durban, South Africa, various trade unions marched together in a stand against xenophobic violence in the country. In Italy, a wreath was sent out to sea by labor leader Susanna Camusso in memory of migrants who died trying to reach European shores. An important official holiday in countries such as the People's Republic of China, North Korea, and the former Soviet Union, May Day celebrations typically feature elaborate popular and military parades. In modern Cuba May Day is massively celebrated with workers marching with their colleagues to the Revolution Square,Havana where special cultural and musical events are held as well as speeches from leading figures. Seen as the largest gathering in Cuba, every year more than a million workers, gather at the foot of the giant statue of Cuba's godfather of the Revolution - Jose Marti on this day. During the Cold War, May Day became intermittent for large military parades in Red Square by the Soviet Union and was attended by the top leaders of the Kremlin, especially the Politburo, atop Lenin's Tomb which became an enduring symbol of that period. In the countries that were part of the former Soviet Union, May Day is traditionally a celebration of the rights of the proletariat.
Kamgar Din
The first May Day celebration in India was organized in Chennai by the Labour Kisan Party of Hindustan on May 1, 1923. This was also the time when the red flag was first used in India. May Day is known as 'Kamgar Din' in Hindi, 'Kamgar Divas' in Marathi and 'Uzhaipalar Naal' in Tamil. In the Philippines, May 1st is known as Araw ng mga Manggaggawa and is a public holiday. Labour organizations and unions hold protests in major cities on this day.
In China, Labor Day was extended to 3 days during the 1990s. The Chinese government made it a seven-day holiday by moving the prior and upcoming weekends together with these three days. This holiday allowed millions of Chinese people to travel during this period. The Chinese government reduced the holiday period down to one day in 2008, while simultaneously reviving three traditional Chinese holidays: the Dragon Boat Festival, Tomb-Sweeping Day and the Mid-Autumn Festival.
In many countries, the May 1 holiday was obtained by trade union agitation supported by socialist parties. However, in Germany where such agitation had proved fruitless, it was instituted in 1933 as a gift from Hitler, being promptly followed by the abolition of trade unions. In the United Kingdom, a May Day Bank Holiday was instituted in 1978 for trade unionists to celebrate, but was held on the first Monday in May to minimize the damage to business.
May Day happens to also coincide with preexisting holidays such as Beltane, the Celtic Spring Festival, in Ireland and the traditional day for giving un brin de muguet (a sprig of Lily of the Valley) to loved ones in France, which dates back to the Renaissance.
Mindful awareness
Today, as we celebrate yet another International Workers' Day, let's make space to appreciate how our work connects us. As Sofia Marbach says in her article How to Celebrate International Workers' Day, perhaps as you start your morning routine, you could cultivate a new mindful awareness of the labor invested in everything that sustains you. Give thanks to the worker who treated the water running from your tap and the worker who helped deliver it to your pipes. Send gratitude to everyone along the chain of labor that made your morning cup of tea, possible.
Remember, a renewed appreciation for all the work that connects us can enrich our lives. Even simple things as shopping ethically considering both the human capital and natural capital put to work to make everything we have possible can help us move toward a more complete picture in which we can see and support both the people who grow what sustains us and the land working hard to produce it.
So, today as you end your workday, (hopefully not much more than 8 hours after you started it), take a moment to remember the people who fought to achieve this or, if you happen to be in one of those countries like ours that celebrate May Day, enjoy the day off!
As author Douglas Pagels said, "Sometimes it's important to work for that pot of gold. But other times it's essential to take time off and to make sure that your most important decision in the day simply consists of choosing which color to slide down on the rainbow." Make today, that day.
