Refurbished courts:
Boost for Sebs’ sports

Stepping into a new sporting era, St Sebastian's College, Moratuwa recently opened their refurbished basketball and tennis courts in a grand ceremony at the college premises. The over Rs 2 million project is considered as a huge leap in Sebs' sports and completed under the supervision of Rev. Fr. Rector Ranjith Andradi. The modified sports facility was declared open by Rev. Fr. Mervyn Fernando, who was the chief guest at the ceremony.
According to Rev. Fr. Rector Ranjith Andradi, the project turned out to be a challenging but a very successful endevour, thanks to the support of old boys, parents and well-wishers. Over 500 attended the opening ceremony and friendly matches between old boys and present students added glamour to the occasion.
