Bank of Ceylon joins hands with IJSo

As a knowledge enhancement initiative for youth in the country, the Bank has joined hands with IJSO to conduct Junior National Olympiad examinations at province level. BOC has also enabled its online banking platform to students to pay their registration fee directly through a special panel that is available especially for IJSO, a feature enabled through the Bank’s digitization process. The BOC extended its generous support for the International Junior Science Olympiad (IJSO) - 2018 that will be held in Gaborone, Botswana.
As a part of the Bank’s commitment to empower the youth in Sri Lanka, the Bank of Ceylon has marked this program as a key event in the bank’s event calendar. This is yet another strategic corporate social responsiblity initiative of the Bank to uplift the education level of the country to enable a sustainable economic development.
Ever since the dawn of science, human society has been surrounded by technology and the products of science every day. Public policy decisions that affect every aspect of our lives are made based on scientific evidence. The immensely complex natural world around us illustrates infinite scientific concepts
The IJSO is a major international educational competition held annually for schoolchildren, to recognize the significance of the Natural Sciences in the general education of young people and in all aspects of their lives. It is an individual and team competition where knowledge related to physics, chemistry and biology are covered and tested simultaneously.
The competition is known for its intricacy as it requires a wide range of knowledge in all the above three aspects of sciences. Each year, Sri Lanka is represented at the IJSO by six contesting students and three university academics. The students for this competition are selected through the Sri Lankan Junior Science Olympiad (SLJSO), an examination held locally at each competition year. Since 2010, the Institute of Physics Sri Lanka has been playing a major role in organizing this competition and holding the SLJSO examinations island wide. Both the SLJSO and IJSO examinations are open for school students in Sri Lanka who are sixteen years or younger on 31st of December of the competition year.
The objective of the SLJSO is to promote an interest in science among school children in Sri Lanka, exposing them to problem-solving, critical thinking and experimentation related to science. The competition is conducted in Sinhala/English/Tamil media on a date decided by the Institute of Physics Sri Lanka.Therefore, the students who follow their school education in Sinhala/English/Tamil media qualify to apply for this competition.
The SLJSO examination paper consists of questions based on physics, chemistry, biology, and mathematics taught up to the ordinary level. Therefore, the students who pursue their school education following the local syllabus in government schools as well as the students who pursue their education following the London or Cambridge syllabi equally qualify to participate in this competition.
The students who excel at the SLJSO preliminary examination are qualified to sit for another selection examination held at the University of Kelaniya on a date specified by the SLJSO organizers. Of the students who will be sitting for this examination, six best performers are selected to represent Sri Lanka at the International Junior Science Olympiad (IJSO).
These students are guided and trained by the academics of the University of Kelaniya.
This year, the first round of SLJSO examination was held on April 7. Registration Deadline for this educational event was on March 27. For more information related to SLJSO and IJSO events, students, teachers and parents please contact Professor H.H. Sumathipala, National Coordinator-Sri Lankan Junior Science Olympiad, Department of Physics, University of Kelaniya, Kelaniya, or visit the web atwww.ipslk.lk.
