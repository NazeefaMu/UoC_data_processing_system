A light from a Sign of Contradiction!

Christ and the way of life ushered in by Him calls people to reach out in three ways: to one’s true self, to others and finally to God. Reaching out to others includes crossing borders in a particularly way towards the most weak, destitute, marginalized and the vulnerable. In his life and wandering through the length and breadth of his home country of Palestine, Jesus’ prime attention and concern was to embrace the sick, those oppressed by the evil spirits and sinners.
The Gospel pages are filled with such striking and amazing stories. Jesus even exposes himself to unnecessary criticism and rude comments of the religious leaders of the time, the Pharisees and the Sadducees, for taking such paths of social contact and encounter. For him, people claim the priority of his compassionate and tender attention. Yet, he is accused of being a rabble-rouse, of blasphemy and of chasing demons in the name of Belzeebul!
Notice how Jesus approaches the Samaritan woman at the famous historical well of Jacob. While the whole episode is a beautiful manifestation of the gentle patience of Jesus, the woman on the other hand puts on a mask, beating round the bush, concealing her life’s secrets and standing her ground.
It is a long journey for her to reach the Living Water that she is really in need of to slake her crushed spirit and slake her soul’s thirst. Jesus embraces little children and makes them symbols of the Kingdom of God. For, only those who make themselves like little children can lay claim to entering God’s kingdom. He is swift to ward off hypocritical attitudes when confronting the Pharisees who brought to Him a woman caught in public sin demanding that she be stoned to death.
Jesus reads their wicked minds and feels disgust at their hypocrisy. He throws an awesome challenge: “Let the one without sin, cast the first stone!” They all disappear dumb-founded and recoiling in shame. We are told that Jesus was constantly at prayer, sometimes in the early hours of the morning and at times in the midst of his heavy ministry while curing the sick, driving out the demons and preaching.
He submitted to God’s will always as we see in the dramatic and touching scene at Gethsamane. He teaches us what prayer is about and how powerful it is when accompanied by sincerity within oneself and humility before God.
Heavy burdens on the poor
No wonder then, Jesus condemns the self-elation of the Pharisee who at the threshold of the sanctuary brags about his righteous deeds while He praises and marvels at the humility of the publican who not daring to enter the temple stands at the door beating his breast seeking divine mercy on his sinfulness. It is this social outcast, the publican who goes home, justified and not the self-righteous Pharisee.
Matthew the evangelist records a series of woes uttered by Jesus against the Pharisees: they are like whitened sepulchers, beautiful outside with nothing but rotten bones and decay. They are like the blind leading the blind leading everyone to the pits of illusion, danger and disaster.
They are blind Pharisees who accuse people of the specks in their eyes, while they themselves have beams that blind them to the truth. They lay heavy burdens on the poor. On the contrary, Jesus declares himself as the source of solace, strength and consolation wishing that people learn from him who is meek and humble of heart. He invites all who labour and are heavy burdened promising rest for their weary souls.
In Jesus who is Word become flesh, we have received grace upon grace as St. John the evangelist says in the very first chapter of his Gospel. He immerses himself in the waters of the river Jordan requesting baptism from John the Baptist, His precursor so that He can identify himself with all who stepped in confessing their sins.
John is quick to declare that amidst the immense throng of people flocking to hear him, there stands a carpenter’s son from Galilee who is the Lamb of God who takes away the sins of the world, the laces of whose shoes he is unworthy to lose.
John now wishes that greater attention be paid to Jesus than to himself for he has accomplished his task of being the voice crying out in the wilderness: “Prepare ye the way of the Lord, make straight his paths” for the time has come for the decision of repentance and change of heart.
The axe is already laid at the root of the trees to cut down those that are not laden with fruit and be cast into the fire. John refuses to baptize Jesus but at His insistence both bow down to the will of God so that all things may be fulfilled.
For Jesus, it was the foretaste of His not too distant baptism on the cross where he would pour out his blood and commend his spirit in obedience, which would be the price of our redemption. As he said: “If He is lifted up, I would then draw all men to myself”. Jesus of Nazareth is the Eternal Galilean. St. Paul addressing the believers in the city of Philippi writes poignantly that the Son of God did not cleave to His divine prerogatives, but emptied Himself unto obedience of the cross for which cause God exalted Him and gave him a name, that is above every name, at the call of which everyone on earth, under the earth and in the high heavens would go down on their knees and proclaim: “Jesus is Lord!”. The divine teacher thus authenticated his own teaching that unless the grain of wheat dies, it will not bear fruit.
Jesus was poor for he was an itinerant preacher who made His listeners aware that he had no place even to lay his head though foxes had dens and birds in the air nests to rest. He had come in fact to do his Father’s will and not his own. The theme of this Lent was that Christ became poor for our sake so that in his poverty we are made rich. Our richness consists in the blessings of redemption flowing from His emptying Himself in love and loving those whom He loved, loving them to the end. Did he not abase himself to go down and wash the feet of his disciples, a mean task usually the lot of the slaves and servants in households when the master received guests into the house! Jesus wants the disciples too to love as he loved and to wash one another’s feet in humility.
Renouncing excessive attachment
As Son of Man, in His humble state of the Incarnation, Jesus had come to serve and not to be served. He wishes all those who want to be perfect to follow Him in detaching themselves and renouncing excessive attachment to earthly goods, possessions and even loved ones. One must not allow himself to be possessed by them. When the rich young man who was thus invited, failed to face the challenge and as he departed, Jesus felt saddened though He was happy to learn that he had kept all the commandments since his youth. God seems to want the best of us and not what we can give in half-measures and with reluctance.
The only way then to enter the light of the Risen Lord and experience Easter, the dawn of new life, grace and Joy in the spirit in the open space of the Kingdom of God, is to look for riches that no brigand steals or no moth destroys.
That is why the first blessing announced by Jesus on the Mount of Beatitudes runs: “Blessed are the poor, for theirs is the Kingdom of God.” God in Christ reached out to us sinners in love and forgiveness.
He is the prodigal father ready to warmly welcome all those who have strayed away squandering their lives in debauchery and yet have decided to come back home. Lent is the journey home from the estranged land of sin and reckless living and Easter is the banquet readied at the Father’s house.
There are plenty of abodes in the house of the Father and Jesus had told us well in advance, that He had gone to prepare a place for His friends with whom He had joyfully shared the great secrets of the Kingdom of God hitherto unseen and unheard.
The Risen Lord is ready to support us in our weak faith and unsteady courage, even opening his wounds for the faithless to touch! He is there stilling storms to a whisper and navigating us to safety. He wants us to launch into the deep for a great draught of abundant fish. Importantly, the echo of Easter is: “Fear Not, it is I. Peace be with You”. It is the reassuring voice of the crucified and Risen Lord.
