Politicians in the making

Politicians throughout the world, for their own reasons, leave some groups out of national conversations. One such group is the younger generation. They are well aware that engaging young people in politics is critical to the safeguarding and strengthening of democracy in any country.
Global statistics prove it. People between the ages of 20 and 44 make up 57 per cent of the world’s voting age population but represents only 14 per cent of the total number of the world’s legislative chamber members.
Sri Lanka is no exception.
According to a three-year old report, although 71.5% of youth in Sri Lanka exercise their right to vote, only a small fraction of less than 15 per cent is directly engaged in politics through activism within political parties and trade unions.
Statistics aside, a variety of issues can have particular impact on the young – not just in traditional “youth” areas like education, employment and health service, but in broader fields such as national reconciliation, climate change and social security reform, which will impact heavily on future generations. In addition, the presence of young people in political positions can make prominent changes in attitudes and leadership qualities of the other politicians.
Two questions
To discuss this issue in a different angle, let’s ask ourselves two basic questions. Why do we want more young people to engage in politics? Is it because it seems like a self-evidently good thing? Or is the truth that the need to reach out is symptomatic of today’s politicians’ own sense of dislocation? Or, a desire to feel more connected? Or is it yet more evidence of the wider depoliticization of society?
The second question is -If we honestly want young people to take politics seriously, do we know what is stopping them from doing so? Is it because of the high level of distrust towards present politicians? Or, is it because of the lack of self-confidence in facing challenges is prevalent amongst young people?
Misconception
One of the most common misconceptions in politics is that candidates and elected persons have to be older, experienced and veterans of legislature. In all respects, there is nothing wrong with being a seasoned politician. In fact, the experiences gained by aged politicians have probably come in handy on more than one occasion.
In order to get young people involved in government we have to move beyond this standard belief.
Today, we have this new, upcoming generation taking the reins and beginning to develop all sorts of opinions unlike any other generation that has come before, but their voices are not being heard like they should be. They have the capabilities of leadership and to be able to make impactful decisions in our country, but it is a challenge to receive the opportunity.
While the current status of young politicians running for local and even national politics is rising, it’s not as high as it should be. The ones that are bold enough to take a risk and accept the challenge bring a whole new dynamic to the table. They’re edgy, modern, and capable of changing along with this world around them. They “push the envelope” on issues that matter to the generation they’re a part of. They think about the future, because it is their future too.
Politicians who’ve held their seats for years upon years have begun to notice the changes happening before their eyes. Some of them do not like to face the change.
Some politicians believe our younger generation are self-interested, self-seeking and self-serving group. They also think that the youth do not care about the future of this country and that is why they ignore politics. The evidence shows that this common wisdom about youth should be reversed – it is politicians who ignore youth, and not the other way around.
Decision makers
Young people are no strangers to scrutiny. They are used to their lives being examined, and their habits questioned by their parents, teachers, prospective employers and friends. They are familiar with the politicians and the press who will often criticise their behaviour.
Yet, it does not appear to be a two-way street, as their own opinions are rarely listened to and seldom taken seriously by leading influences in the community.
The majority of young people are interested in the decision-making processes that affect their daily lives, even if some of them are too disengaged or disillusioned by the present problems to realise it.
They all have concerns about their future – ranging from racial and other discrimination to the lack of economical access to higher education, efficient health services, jobs and affordable homes. They should not allow themselves to be passed off as too indifferent to participate in such discussions. Young people must be granted the opportunity to discuss current affairs and take notice of the policy areas where they have an important perspective.
Stand up
The chances are that most of the young people may not hold party memberships, not because of a lack of interest in contributing to public debate but due to a barrier that has built up by the alienation of politicians. Our leaders cannot ignore popular culture among younger generations and take the easy route by allowing senior politicians to dictate public opinion.
Its time young people should stand up and be counted in order to prove that they are responsible enough and likely enough to engage in the process. All kinds of teenagers and undergraduates are eager to defy the elitist tendencies of older generations in future parliaments. What’s more, for the health of our democracy, we should encourage them to do so.
Quota
So, it is quite clear that young peoples’ concerns need to be voiced and heard. There are only a few young people in positions of power, including in legislative bodies.
The introduction of quotas in parliament for young people under the age of 30 years old - for instance, through reserving 10 percent or more for the age group 18-30 years old - could be an important part of the solution for a number of reasons.
1) Young people are stakeholders of the present and the future
In fact, young people have a higher stake in some policies than older people. They will have to experience a comparatively higher share of the long-term negative consequences of politically short-term measures than older generations.
2) To include youth concerns in the party packaging of political ideas
Young parliamentarians can contribute to reform or expand the party policy packages through pushing for a better inclusion of youth concerns in agendas. Younger parliamentarians can easily pick on specific problems relating to housing, education and unemployment in a different way than older one would.
However, although the concept of “youth interests” is a valid point, it doesn’t mean that their answers are always right. Their interpretation of social and national issues will be based on their own goals, values or social class. However, quotas can help in making sure that political parties include those youth concerns which will spur more deliberation in parliament on these issues.
3) Inter-generational diversity promotes innovation and change
Inter-generational collaborations can play a very positive role in the development innovating problem-solving mechanisms.
They also will foster a better understanding and resolution of problems. If collaboration between young and old promotes innovation and efficiency, then the absence of young people in parliament risks undermining the quality of parliamentary discussions (compared to what they could be).
4) Acknowledge young people as political equals and political actors
Finally, youth quotas would signal to society and, particularly, to young people that their contribution is valued and that they are considered with equal respect. Their status as equal citizens would be attested, recognized and emphasized. Youth quotas could thus participate in a redefinition of young adults as able to rule and reinforce their image as equal citizens.
We urgently need young people that can grow right along with us, developing around the needs of a society that is rapidly changing. That is what we need in our politics; blossoming millennial leaders to take charge
