Celebrating Mother’s Day with a movie

Super hero fans might be content this year since there are so many superhero blockbustersflocking into theaters. So is there something of a different formula for movie buffs tho are looking for a bit of difference
Ceylon Theaters have decided to break the shackles and bring in movies with a difference. The first on their list ‘Mother’s Day’ comprises a stellar cast: Julia Roberts, Jennifer Aniston, Kate Hudson and Jason Sudeikis., and will be releasing on April 29 – Mother’s Day – as a tribute to mothers from across the world. The movie will be screening at Majestic Cineplex and Empire Cineplex.
As Mother’s Day draws close, a group of seemingly unconnected people come to terms with the relationships they have with their mothers. Sandy (Jennifer Aniston) is a divorced mother of two boys whose ex-husband has recently remarried a younger woman named Tina (Shay Mitchell). Miranda (Julia Roberts) is an accomplished writer who gave up her only child, Kristin (Britt Robertson) for adoption at birth. But as a grown-up Kristin prepares herself for marriage, she begins to contemplate the missing part in her life and is encouraged by her friend, Jesse (Kate Hudson), to go out and find her mother.
Meanwhile, Jesse, who never sees her mother, is surprised by her parents when they come to visit and must come to terms with their failing relationship.
