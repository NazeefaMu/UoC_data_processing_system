Lay the foundation for sacred heights

The Lankaramaya dagoba with over two millennia history was built with the Buddha’s relics enshrined. It is one of the eight sacred sites of Anuradhapura revered by the Buddhists across the country.
Located to the Southwest of Abayagiri dagoba the Lankaramaya was constructed by King Valagamba, a nephew of King Dutugemunu during the 1st century BC.
The Dagoba was reduced to ruins as a result of the constant invasions. The devotees to the Dagoba, however, have increased in numbers. All the same, the temple does not have a proper shrine room.
The Lankaramaya Chief Incumbent Ven Relapanawe Dhammajothi Thera said that the construction of a shrine room has commenced. The enshrined relics include a part of the Buddha’s belt and the Queen Soma’s jewellery (which was offered to the Buddhist Order later).
According to Ven Relapanawe Dhammajothi Thera, King Valagamaba was the fourth son of King Saddhatissa, the brother of King Dutugemunu. King Valagamba’s three elder brothers: Thulatthana, Lanja Tissa and Khallata Naga ruled the country before him.
The Venerable Thera added that Maharattaka, a General of King Khallata Naga, killed the latter and usurped the power.
“Then the prince Valagamba killed the general in turn and took the throne himself,” elaborated Venerable Dhammajothi Thera. “Then he brought up the son of his assassinated brother as his own son and made Anuladevi the Queen of Khallata Naga his queen too. He had another queen. She was Somadevi.”
One should not yet mistake this Somavathi queen of Polonnaruwa for her namesake in Anuradhapura. The Somawathi Dagoba was constructed on the instructions of Queen Somawathi of Polonnaruwa.
A few months following King Valagamba’s coronation, a Brahmin named Thissa in Rohana rebelled against the king. In the meanwhile, Cholas from South India, led by seven leaders, also landed in the country. They demanded power from the king. Ven Relapanawe Dhammajothi Thera said there had been a shrine room during the royal times.
“However now there is no shrine room. We have already laid the foundation for the construction of a shrine room above 2500 square feet. We have set up a Committee to make this project a reality with the assistance of a pious group of devotees from Gampaha area led by a lady teacher,” added Venerable Relapanawe Dhammajothi Thera.
The construction of a shrine room is one the eight most efficacious merits that a devotee can execute.
As the President of the Anuradhapura Lankarama Temple Shrine Room Fund, Venerable Dhammajothi Thera said that the construction cost of one square foot of the shrine room is around Rs 7000 including for the interior decorations and those who wish to make their contributions either could contact 0252221884 or 0777855399, or email at [email protected]. The contributions could be made to a bank account in Anuradhapura.
