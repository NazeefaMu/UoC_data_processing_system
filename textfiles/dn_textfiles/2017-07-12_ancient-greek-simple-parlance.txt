Ancient Greek in simple parlance

Criteria for evaluating literature have been of controversy throughout the years ever since it was first established and had become a popular necessity.
The numerous ideas pertaining to evaluation has been subject to change before the actual ideas took their form as 'criteria'. The 'criteria' mainly depended on the changing values of the social context they were exercising. On the other hand, literature had been considerably established before its reception and appreciation.
Then came to be the relationship between the creative artist and the recipient being guided by a third party. It is then literature ceased to be just 'good' or 'bad' mostly depending on its appeal.
Distant past
Greek literary theory has served as a foundation on which Western literary criticism had been built. The impact had been such it reverberates in the East of the modern day as well. Often people hark back to the critics of the distant past; quoting them even to the point of misinterpreting them. Refuting also weighs equally to appreciating as well as approving as it signifies its impact on thought.
The reason to compile this volume in simple English with quotations to substantiate facts and arguments is to encourage readers to read further on the subject.
Professor Kamani Jayasekara has provided a brief introduction to the origin of literary criticism in Greece and concentrated on Aristophanes and Plato. The criticisms, one may observe are value based which again could be interpreted as the criteria of assessment for the individual involved.
Modern context
As a creative writer Professor Jayasekara entertains grave concerns regarding how and to what extent critics operate in the modern context. For her, it is somewhat difficult to comprehend how and why the creative has to be monitored within imposed limits or methodologies. Then comes the personal; the extent to which a person's private affiliations have an impact on the evaluation of another. Thereafter the consciousness of the responsibility of such a medium and their integrity.
The facts collected are mostly based on Professor Jayasekara’s doctoral thesis – 'Social Conscience and Social consciousness of Greek' Dramatists of the Classical Period of Ancient Greece.
