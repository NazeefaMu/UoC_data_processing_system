Qatar Airways Group Chief Executive Named ‘Aviation Executive of the Year’ by CAPA

Qatar Airways Group Chief Executive, Akbar Al Baker, has been named the ‘Aviation Executive of the Year’ by the CAPA Centre for Aviation, an independent body that provides market intelligence and data to the global aviation industry.
Al Baker received the award at the organisation’s glittering gala dinner, held this evening in Singapore as part of the CAPA Asia Summit 2017.
The prestigious award recognises Al Baker’s influence on the aviation industry, demonstrating outstanding strategic thinking and innovative direction in shepherding the growth of Qatar Airways’ business and the wider aviation industry as a whole.
Al Baker said of the award: “It is a tremendous honour to be named the ‘CAPA Aviation Executive of the Year’ in this, a very special year for Qatar Airways, as we celebrate our 20th anniversary. We have come so far in the past 20 years, rising from a small regional carrier to become a global airline, committed to innovation and to delivering the highest standards to our passengers. Not only as an airline, but as a nation, we are tremendously proud of this accomplishment. In spite of the backdrop of an illegal blockade on our country, as we look ahead, we know that truly the best is yet to come.”
Executive Chairman of CAPA Centre for Aviation, Peter Harbison, said: “Akbar Al Baker has not let Qatar Airways lose its shine during one of its most testing years. Under his guidance, the airline has recalibrated its network to function without access to several neighbouring countries. At the same time, Qatar Airways has continued its expansion plans and created new avenues for growth. He has turned a setback into an opportunity. This is truly a remarkable achievement.”
Al Baker is one of the most influential figures in international aviation. Under his leadership, Qatar Airways has grown to become the world’s fastest-growing airline, operating one of the youngest and most technologically advanced fleets in the sky. A widely recognised and well-respected industry innovator, Al Baker was elected chairman of the Board of Governors (BoG) of the influential global aviation industry body International Air Transport Association (IATA), effective June 2018.
