Buddhasasana Minister Gamini Jayawickrama Perera, addressing a media briefing in Colombo yesterday, said the Vesak Week will begin on April 26 and end on May 2. One of the main objectives this year is to create a righteous and pragmatic society based on the concept of the temple-centred village to seek spiritual and physical sustainable development.

The six-day Vesak festival will carry separate themes each day. They are Buddhism and sustainable environment, health and Buddhism, history and Buddhism, literature and Buddhism, art and Buddhism, economy, professional life and social development and Buddhism.
Accordingly, 150 spiritual development programmes, 16 Dhamma school teacher training programmes, 61 programmes on health and Buddhism, 30 children’s meditation programmes, 18 programmes on Buddhism and professional life, 20 programmes to train Samanera Bhikkus and 37 programmes based on bonds between parents and children will be conducted.
In addition, a Buddhist short drama competition, Bhakti Gee programmes, programmes on the preservation of Buddhist books, special Dhamma sermons, Pindapatha programmes and training programmes for Dasa Sil Mathas will also be held during the week.
“We are proud to conduct the State Vesak Festival in our historic district,” the Minister said. “We see this as a boon for us to improve the region’s infrastructure and facilities, in parallel with the arrangements to hold the festival,” he said.
“We took steps to upgrade the historic Bingiriya Devagiri Rajamaha Viharaya. “The infrastructure around the temple too had been developed along with the programme,” he said.
Meanwhile, 300 Dhamma schools and 250 temples located in Kurunegala will also be developed parallel to the programme.
