Big Blow for Sri Lanka: Tharanga suspended for two ODIs

On top of the injury sustained by Angelo Mathews that resulted in the captain sitting out the opening Group B Champions Trophy fixture against South Africa at the Oval on Saturday, vice-captain Upul Tharanga who led the team has been suspended from the next two matches after his side was found guilty of a serious over-rate offence in the match.
David Boon of the Emirates Elite Panel of ICC Match Referees imposed the suspension after the Sri Lanka side was ruled to be four overs short of its target when time allowances were taken into consideration. In accordance with Article 2.5.2 of the ICC Code of Conduct for Players and Player Support Personnel, which relates to serious over-rate offences, players were fined 10 per cent of their match fees for the first two overs and 20 per cent of their match fees for the additional overs their side failed to bowl in the allotted time, with the captain also receiving two suspension points.
As two suspension points equate to a ban from one Test or two ODIs or two T20Is, whatever comes first for the player, Tharanga has been suspended from his side’s upcoming matches against India (at The Oval, 8 June) and Pakistan (at the Cardiff Wales Stadium, 12 June), while each of his players have received a fine of 60 per cent.
Tharanga pleaded guilty to the offence and accepted the proposed sanction, so there was no need for a formal hearing.
The charge was laid by on-field umpires Ian Gould and Aleem Dar, third umpire Paul Reiffel and fourth official Bruce Oxenford, all from the Emirates Elite Panel of ICC Umpires. Unless Mathews recovers from his calf injury before Sri Lanka’s next game against India at the Oval on June 8, Sri Lanka will be forced to appoint discarded vice-captain Dinesh Chandimal to lead the team in the next two Group B games. Sri Lanka’s final group match is against Pakistan at Cardiff on June 12. Apart from leading the team, Tharanga is one of the few Sri Lankan batsmen in form.
He scored a half-century in Sri Lanka’s 96-run loss to South Africa.
