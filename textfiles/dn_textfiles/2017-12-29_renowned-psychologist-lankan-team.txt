Renowned psychologist for Lankan team

Sri Lanka head coach Chandika Hathurusingha said that he intends using a renowned psychologist to work with the Sri Lanka team at different intervals of time to identify the players.
As a first step towards obtaining his services a questionnaire comprising 40 questions prepared by the psychologist Dr Phil Jauncey was handed to the players to reply. Dr Jauncey is widely regarded as Australia’s foremost Performance Psychologist.
“I have worked with him for the last four years. He is coming on January 3 and spend ten days with us. I intend to bring him from time to time. Ideally bring him down four times a year depending on his availability. The questionnaire was prepared by him to understand players and profiling of players,” explained Hathurusingha.
“Dr. Phil Jauncey is from Brisbane, Australia. I met him for the first time with Sydney Thunder. Mike Hussey introduced me to him. He had been using him as a personal psychologist. He may be on some tours as well. It will help me to identify players. He has been with Australian Olympic team and worked with Cricket Australia when John Buchanan was their coach,” he said.
Hathurusingha said that although he has been given the freedom to choose his own support staff for the time being he intends to go with the present lot. “At the moment, I am going to work with what I have. If I feel that I need some additions, I have the opportunity to add someone.” – ST
