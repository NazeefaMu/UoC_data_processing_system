More wet weather expected

The Meteorology Department officials predicted showery weather and cloudy skies over the country during the next few days, due to an atmospheric disturbance located to the South-east of Sri Lanka.
"Fairly strong winds are also likely at Western and Southern sea areas. Under the influence of the atmospheric disturbance, showers or thundershowers will occur over most parts of the island and sea area around the island. Heavy rain falls (more than 100 mm) are also expected at some places.
There may be temporary localized strong winds during thundershowers.
The public is requested to take precautions to minimize damages caused by lightning activity" weather forecast stated. It further forecast that the deep sea areas off the coast extending from Kankasanthurei to Hambantota via Mannar, Colombo and Galle will be rough at times as the winds could strengthen up to 50-60 kmph at times.
