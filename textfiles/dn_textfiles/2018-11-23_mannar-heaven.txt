Mannar from heaven!

Juliet Coombe explores the mysterious South Eastern Mannar coastline for the truth about the legendary much talked about Adams Bridge to India and to see the fading grandeur of Mannar colonial fort.
The helicopter blades whirled around and suddenly we were off to explore the island and to see Mannar Fort, once a pivotal military spot and today a fantastic spot to see marine life. An ethereal historic place with a chain of random sandbanks and tiny islands, that can be crossed on foot at low tide and has been used as a bridge for thousands of years. The greatest legend of all about it is that the first man Adam to cross by foot from India to Sri Lanka used it, and on this famous trip he visited the now named site Adam’s Peak, where he left his giant footprint.
The bridge explained one of the old fishing guys is also known as Rama’s Bridge as it is talked about in the Sanskrit Epic Ramayana, where it is said that the bridge was built by the Vanara, and an army of powerful men, when they came to Sri Lanka in search of his wife Sita. Spanning a distance of 48km and with waters as shallow as 3ft in places and 30ft deep at others, they say the bridge can be crossed at low tide as some of the shoals are compounded enough sand banks to do so, but I am yet to find anyone in recent times that will have a go. However old, or whatever the legend about it, the bridge is a spectacular sight when viewed from the air in a helicopter or thirty-seater plane.
A bridge that leads to the gargantuan Baobab tree, like an elephant’s mammoth foot stuck in the landscape welcoming all those that come to visit the colonial fort town of Mannar. A fascinating often-hollow tree in the middle where stories of mythical creatures live is told by island story tellers and the local fisherman say was planted by visiting Arab traders hundreds of years ago at the height of the Golden Age of trade. The tree appears out of the deserted landscape like a giant dwarf, gnarled and monstrous in form, that even when three people join hands you can’t put your arms around its circumference. Mannar even now is a lost world of hang mans nooses and a once grand colonial fort, now only occupied by a bunch of rather frisky donkeys and the howling winds of time.
Mannar is still only for the truly adventurous traveller, a time locked trinket, a Machu Picchu, a true lost city, a wonderful settlement hidden courtyards, cabanas and occasional banana or coconut tree breaking the idyllic historic views of fishing life today. One wonders how such an important building was created in such a challenging spot and what life must have been like living inside its ancient walls.
The action in Mannar centres around the busy old harbour, both broken and ravaged by time, tinged with the violent repose of man. Can hope, however dissolute, exist in these scenes one wonders as one moves between the boxes of fish to the colorfully entangled nets? Here you can meet the local fisherman all characters in their own right and view the hardy ones waist deep near their moored boats hanging out nets to the stick poles high corners. Inside the stone decked fishery atop a brick laden hull of a building you will find the days catch for sale, even some that are illegal to trawl in other parts of the world. The master fisherman has frazzled white curled hair, white long sleeves rolled at the elbows and a gold chain; a bluish green towel turban covers his hair.
The area is it seems always full of crows in pensive séance, their black long fish tailed coats perched on the boat’s wooden boudoir like a scene out of Alfred Hitchcock’s film The Birds with letters from the Tamil dialect flecking the yellow signage on starboard side. It’s hard not to be awe struck by the manta ray and blue flecked crabs for sale in the early morning sun dripping ice in all directions, which look so delicious it brings on a desire to try these fishy delicacies raw.
Desolate braying donkeys lead me from the fishy fish market to the majestic abandoned Portuguese fort, where they have turned this magnificent spot into their nightly stable. The fort has four bastions and as you enter the original gate a sense of wonder creeps in and surprise as you discover the original gallows still stands on the main bastion, complete with rope and the wood groans as the beam sways in the wind. The donkeys trot along the ramparts enjoying the scenic sea views, oblivious of its colorful past.
The Fort walls vary in size and stature, and a passing coconut seller tells me it was built with African slaves in 1696. On October 5, 1795 the Dutch finally surrendered this stoic garrison to the British, who used it for military purposes during the first and Second World War. It was militarised until 1948, when the country finally received independence from the British. Looking out from the walls across the ocean where the legendary Adams Bridge Lies and back past the thick octopus like tree trunks deeply intertwined into the ancient citadel historic walls, it is easy to see why people fought so hard for this heavenly spot. A place rich in fishing bounty and raw natural beauty one half expects to find a Harry Potter movie being shot. It is a hypnotic spot full of mystical charm with its crazy giant size tree, majestic stone fort and old school harbour.
