One death too many

Recent media reports said that over 60,000 persons were afflicted with Dengue Fever (DF) since the beginning of this year. Half of this number is from the Western province. The number of deaths has also reached a record high which exceeds 160 since the beginning of this year.
However statistics alone does not point to the human tragedy behind them. They are like dead wood which can be broken down at will to suit anyone’s interest. That is why politicians often use the same statistics to prove even opposing trends. Like the devil quoting scriptures to suit his purpose, they would quote statistics to prove that they were or are better managers of the disease than their opponents. That is why celebrated American writer and humorist Mark Twain said there are three types of lies – lies, damn lies and statistics.
One may quote statistics to prove that the death rate is declining but the question is that from the human point of view, from the point of view of members of the family or the next of kin even one death is too many. It is they that suffer most from such unfortunate developments. The fact that fewer deaths are taking place in society is no consolation to the members of the bereaved family. That is why the target should be zero avoidable deaths and nothing else.
Epidemic level
One may classify death from Dengue fever as a natural death. Yet it is not so strictly speaking since the causes giving rise to the disease are mostly man made or results of human action.
It was in the early 1960’s that dengue fever was discovered in Sri Lanka. But then it was an isolated and sporadic phenomenon. It began to spread substantially during 2004-07 period. Now it has reached an epidemic level, a fact not so highlighted by the authorities.
It must be said that authorities, especially governments in power since then did not pursue in earnest the cause of prevention and eradication of the disease. Though much has been said and fanciful programmes were laid bare for the same nothing materialized. Cuba, one of the few countries that have successfully fought against DF offered us generous assistance. Cuban specialists visited the country thrice at their own expense and conducted surveys and handed over reports recommending measures to be taken to combat the disease. They promised to give BTI, a bio-agent destroying the breeding grounds of the Aides mosquito. But the government was not interested.
The message conveyed by a former Health Minister to the Cuban Ambassador was that Sri Lanka could manage on its own. However, due to public agitation and appeals to the President of the country a small amount of BTI was brought down but was left unused in the stores almost till the expiry date. Vested interests as well as a section of misguided professionals too objected to the use of BTI. Even a local manufacturer was not given permission to proceed with the production of BTI locally. However, BTI was imported from the United States and used in the Colombo Municipal region with no protests. It is sad to note that a proposal from Cuba to build a factory for the production of BTI still remains without being pursued by the Sri Lankan authorities despite the current severe epidemic of DF. So much for the commitment of politicians!
The gravity of the problem is still not understood. Official statistics show only the tip of the iceberg. There are many more unreported DF cases. Those that seek treatment from the native physicians or others as well as un-hospitalized patients are not taken into account. There may also be DF patients who were not recognized as such by physicians.
Often there is a misconception that DF is a mere health hazard. It is much more. It is an environmental issue and a social issue by now. It affects several spheres of the material life of society including health, education, labour, productivity etc.
Non-comprehension of the problem in toto has resulted in our inability to develop a holistic approach for combatting it. Only partial solution and primitive methods have been used so far. Nor is there any agreement on what is to be done. Combatting DF requires several methods. It is not enough to rely on only one or two methods of reducing the Aedes mosquito population. Recently a Chief Minister has declared that fumigation is not a successful method and decried its use. It is true that fumigation alone is not sufficient. But it in association with other methods could successfully limit the spread of the disease. Now the government is contemplating importing BTI from Australia. Good. But what about producing it locally and assisting the local private entrepreneur who wanted to do so?
State and private hospitals
This column has repeatedly emphasized the futility of militaristic and bureaucratic methods in combatting the spread of DF and called for public mobilization in cleaning the environment. It is heartening to hear that the SLFP youth have decided to join that effort en masse. Let us hope that other political parties would also follow the lead given by the SLFP youth.
At this moment when the masses are faced with a double disaster – foods and DF, it is high time that the Government divert funds for eradicating DF by cutting down wasteful expenditure and postponing cosmetic projects such as city beautification and concentrate on ensuring sound health for the masses.
Though statistics do not portray the present situation correctly, it is graphically portrayed by the overcrowding at both State and private hospitals. The Hospital for Fever patients at Angoda, the Colombo North and South Teaching Hospitals, the Jayawardhanapura Hospital are all full to the brim that patients are turned away without being admitted. In these hospitals several DF patients share a single bed and some are under the bed or on the floor elsewhere. Few fortunate get a chair to sit. It is said that in pediatric wards five sick children are in two beds joined together. In all these instances it is the poor and the poorest of the poor that suffer most.
It is very unfortunate that no one- neither the public nor the leaders of the government, who never ceases to praise the dedication of the Armed Services personnel in a past war ever open their mouths in praise of healthcare workers from the consultant to the minor employee who are performing Herculean task of looking after thrice the usual number of patients they handle with no respite. Perhaps they are being blinded by the political hatred with which they view the GMOA over differences in their perception of the SAITM crisis. The media too seems to follow the same policy.
