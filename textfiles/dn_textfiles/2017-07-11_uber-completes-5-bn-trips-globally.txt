Uber completes 5 bn trips globally

Uber started in 2010 to solve a simple problem: how do you get a ride at the push of a button? In late 2015, we hit a big milestone: one billion trips. Six months later, we crossed two billion. And just a few weeks ago, on Saturday, May 20, 156 trips started simultaneously at 7:29:06am GMT, putting us over the five billion mark.
These trips happened in 24 countries on six continents, in cities like Mumbai, Moscow and Medellin. One lucky driver was on his first trip: he picked up a passenger on a motorbike in Jakarta, Indonesia, and six other riders were taking their first Uber trips, too. The shortest trip of the bunch lasted just 2.5 blocks in San Francisco while the longest lasted 17 miles in Singapore. Fifteen riders were on the road, using Uber outside their home city.
All of these trips wouldn’t be possible without the hard work of drivers. We’re giving each of the 156 drivers involved in this milestone USD 500 to say thanks.
Moving forward, we’re more focused than ever on building features for riders and drivers that will get us to the next five billion. This is just the beginning...we’ll see you out on the road.
