Temporary driving licence to be issued for Ramith Rambukwella

Colombo Additional Magistrate Chandana Kalansuriya ordered the Narahenpita police to issue a temporary driving licence to Keheliya Rambukwella's son Ramitha Rambukwella.
Narahenpita Police filed the case against cricketer Ramith Rambukwella for driving under the influence of alcohol and knocking down two university students on a motorcycle.
The President's Counsel, appearing on behalf of Ramitha Rambukwella, submitted before the Magistrate that his client faces inconvenience during his day to day activities due to the suspension of his driving licence for over three months.
The two university students do not expect any compensation from Rambukwella.
The Additional Magistrate decided to release the two university students and fixed the inquiry for July 10.
