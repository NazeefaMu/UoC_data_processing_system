Sweet revenge for Proteas – win 1st U19 ODI

South Africa gained sweet revenge from Sri Lanka for their defeat in the Tri-Nations Under 19 final when they won the first under 19 one-day international by sevens at Oudtshoorn on Wednesday.
Krishan Arachchige was the only batsman to make any worthwhile contribution with a half- century off 79 balls in Sri Lanka’s total of 214 in 49 overs.
South Africa chased down the target with two overs to spare despite losing opener Jesse Christensen to the first ball of the innings.
South Africa also lost a further two wickets to be three down for 46 before an unbroken fourth wicket stand of 169 between Raynard von Tonder (89 n.o.) and Mitchell van Buuren (92 n.o.) saw them home.
The second U19 ODI will be played at the same venue on February 3.
Scores: Sri Lanka U19 – 214 in 49 overs (V Chaturanga 37, A Fernando 26, K Arachchige 53, A Bandara 20, J Daniel 23, R de Swardt 2/44, M Cohen 2/37, L Sipamla 2/30)
South Africa U19 – 215-3 in 48 overs (W Makwetu 20, R von Tonder 89 n.o., M van Buuren 92 n.o.)
