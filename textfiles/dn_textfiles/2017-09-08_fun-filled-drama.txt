Fun -filled drama!

It all began six years ago for Gateway during a three day long drama workshop. The student turnout was tremendous. It was a sign that a current had started up within the walls of Gateway. Dramatic Moves features the Gateway College Colombo Drama Club whose arrival signaled the emergence of a new force that would change the destinies of all other schools.
Drama is to come alive. It is life, in all life’s wondrous forms. It is the past re awakened on stage. It is the realization of the dreams and visions of the future. It is life itself. It offers one the wonderful opportunity of seeing through the eyes of another. Teacher in Charge, Vasanthi Jayawardana, pointed out that the students are not only confronted by the lines of a script, they live the script. It is the restoration of a tale told centuries ago.
Not only is drama a discovery of a new world, along the way it teaches you something. It is a huge experience in team work, individual responsibilities and the basics of discipline. It is more than possessing a degree or a diploma, it is the molding of a confident and well -rounded individual.
“It takes a lot of passion, dedication and self -discipline. It is a commitment you make not only to yourself, it is also a commitment to others,” said Jayawardana.
This is their fifth consecutive year in operation. Six years ago, chairman Dr. Harsha Alles made arrangements with our current consultant Jerome L. de Silva to conduct a 03-day long drama workshop for the students of all four of our branches. It was done in order to gauge their interest in drama so that the Drama Club could be established. All the teachers received an open invitation to attend this workshop as well.
“I attended this workshop as a teacher of the Gateway School of Speech & Drama. I remember that the auditorium was packed with students from the four branches and there was a tremendous amount of interest and enthusiasm among the students who participated,” said Jayawardana.
Of course this is not to say that Gateway College Colombo has not put up concerts and small scale productions before. They started doing large scale productions with the establishment of the Drama Club following the huge success of that initial workshop.
“A year after the workshop that helped inaugurate our drama club, we staged our first major production called “Midnight Saga” (2012). It was a mix of Shakespeare and different, more modern styles. It was an exercise which the students who took part thoroughly enjoyed. That production proved to be a huge success. I would say that the Drama club has never looked back since that production because it went on to produce “A Midsummer Night’s Dream” (2014), “A Little Mermaid” (2015) and “Robin & The Sherwood Hoodies” (2016). The fact that all of those projects culminated in success is partly thanks to all the previous drama teachers of the school. Right now, we are working on our next production “Romeo & Winifred” which will be staged at The Lionel Wendt on the 7th of February in 2018,” explained Jayawardana.
Gateway is always delighted to provide the members of the Drama Club, the opportunity for exposure to some of the most prestigious events related to drama in the country such as the Annual Inter-School Shakespeare Drama Competition.
A huge improvement
Consultant/Director, Jerome L. de Silva role is pivotal and he is the pillar the drama club rests on. The drama club would not exist if it had not been for Jerome’s dedication and the dedication of the children and even their parents and the other teachers. That has enabled us to keep the drama club going without it dying down.
“It also has been in my experience that it is not only about confidence. In my years of teaching drama, I have encountered children who are labeled as dyslexic, autistic and having ADHD. There are many of these children in Drama Clubs and we don’t even realize it. The parents have told us that the therapists of these children have found a huge improvement after joining drama. That is a major thing. In drama we don’t have labels and as far as we are concerned everyone has talent. I work with Gateway achievers who are children with special needs. Drama is a therapy. These achievers are very talented,” said De Silva
When Daily News visited Gateway the girls were practicing for their production ‘Merchant of Venice’ for Shakespeare and the boys were practicing for their production of ‘Othello’ for Shakespeare.
Many benefits
Secretary, Hasali Wirasinha was very upbeat speaking positively about practices saying that the cast have been practicing enthusiastically to put up a good show. They have been practicing morning, evenings and sometimes at night. Wirasinha pointed out that drama has had a very positive effect on her life and her other extra- curricular activities such as swimming, basketball and athletics. All in all with the passing of time, friendships have been formed and she has reaped many benefits such as improved audibility and a greater clarity of speech.
“I am still shy, but now more than blend into the background my presence is more visible on stage. I now speak out and drama has helped me a lot in that way. It has also helped me in other sports and other activities such as swimming, basketball and athletics,” said Wirasinha
Teacher in charge Vasanthi Jayawardana interjected that it is also a lesson in life. You don’t panic when things go wrong. You improvise and fix things and change your plans as you go. Quick thinking is important because they are on their own on stage. They need to manage the situation. The students have all had a good taste of drama and they have proved relentless in reaching the highest that they can get. That is the sort of work ethic the drama club instills in the students.
Discovering a new side
President, J’Shara Ahamadeen, initially a shy girl has now cast her inhibitions aside and now embraces the field of drama. She correctly pointed out that drama has this remarkable way of opening your eyes to yourself. You get to know a part of your mind through drama. You get to know a different way of thinking. drama helps you address your fears. You think differently and it adds to your confidence. With that confidence you become more independent. By discovering a new side to yourself you think better when encountering obstacles.
“For me practices have been very energetic and fun. There is absolutely no lethargy amongst the cast members. It is great getting to know everybody especially those I have only seen at school. It is nice to make new friends. At the start I was a very shy girl. I have really got better at my words, and overall my performance in speaking roles have really improved. If you enter something without passion or enter something without any future goal in mind, it kind of makes you lethargic while doing practice. And that can ruin things for the rest of the cast,” said Ahamadeen.
Drama automatically makes you friendlier and Ahamadeen discovered this early on. She was new to school and everyone was so friendly. They accepted her and made her feel at home.
And when you start practices, from that moment you are the character. An actor/ actress cannot go into his/her mindset at all. This discipline is also a very good way of handling life’s obstacles. Because you have no choice but to get into the mindset of your character.
Background checks
Co-Treasurer, Ruwantha Supun Kumara, discovered he had stage fright only when he took up drama. This problem was immediately rectified with a period of practice with Jayawardana. Kumara is a diligent young man who researches intensively when playing a role.
“I have a love for literature and that also helped me out when playing Hamlet. Medieval language does not come easily to people nowadays. So I did background checks on that. It is hard to get into a role but with the right amount of dedication and practice you can achieve it.”
Acting styles
Co-Treasurer, Senika Wanigarathna owes his success to the endless hours of practice. Though shy at first, his friends have always been behind him and with the help of Jaywardane it was only a matter of time until he reached his goal.
“I was really shy at first but my friends and Ms. Jayawardana were so supportive of me and really gave me the boost I needed. The endless hours of practice have helped us perfect the words and acting styles.”
Senior Member, Anish Fonseka and Senior Member, Isira Methnuka Edussuriya stressed that discipline is important to succeed as a dramatist. Edussuriya speculated that it is indeed controlled fun. Both agreed that one has to apply themselves doing hard work.
“If you ask me which Shakespearean character I like to play it would be Iago. He is very evil and evil is always fun! But if you ask me who I relate to in Shakespeare, it maybe Hamlet. What happens to him is out of his control but he is one of the nicest people in Shakespeare,” said Fonseka.
