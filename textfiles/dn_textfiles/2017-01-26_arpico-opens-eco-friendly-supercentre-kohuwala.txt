Arpico opens eco-friendly supercentre at Kohuwala

The shopping experience in the Kohuwala area is scaling new heights following the opening of an environment friendly hypermarket in the heart of the suburb by Arpico.
The Arpico Supercentre at S. De S. Jayasinghe Mawatha, Kohuwala, is the 20th hypermarket owned by the retail giant, and offers 25,000 square feet of shopping space for the customary panoramic product range synonymous with Arpico Supercentres elsewhere.
Additionally, the purpose designed building’s eco-friendly credentials make it one of the Greenest supermarket outlets in Sri Lanka, the retailer said.
Canadian High Commissioner Shelly Whiting, opened the new Arpico Supercentre accommodates more than 40,000 products including fast moving consumer.
The new Supercentre also reflects the Arpico chain’s efforts to be the leader in Green supermarkets in Sri Lanka. Solar panels installed on the building generate clean energy with a capacity of 107 kWp (Kilo Watt Peak), and are capable of generating 2 GWh of electricity per annum. Inverter type air conditioning systems and refrigeration systems with CFC-free refrigerants help reduce power consumption and ozone depletion, and a waste water treatment plant eliminates the use of potable water for landscape irrigation.
The Arpico retail chain now comprises of 20 Arpico Supercentres and Superstores, 16 showrooms and 23 Arpico Daily mini supermarkets. The Arpico Supercentres are the company’s flagship outlets, offering extensive parking, bill payments, banking facilities, lifestyle needs and the widest range of products with the promise to shoppers that they are the most convenient shopping destinations in the country.
The retail chain broke new ground in its spectrum of convenience last year with the launch of its“e Supercentre”- a sophisticated online shopping portal offering the widest product range online, accessible 24 hours of the day from anywhere in the world.
