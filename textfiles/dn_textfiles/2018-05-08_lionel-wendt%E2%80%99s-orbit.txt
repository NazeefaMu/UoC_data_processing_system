In Lionel Wendt’s orbit

Lionel Wendt. That name is now chiselled into a theatre. Even those who have not heard of him – or heard him play the piano - know his name. They come across some of his works without being aware of his entitlement to the authorship.
In the biography of Lionel Wendt, Sampath Bandara takes stock of his versatility in one paragraph.
“Lionel Wendt was an internationally reputed photographer; a consummate pianist; a lover of the cinema; a forerunner in the art of criticism; a collector of art; a sponsor of fledgeling artists; a sponsor and advisor of art. At the same time, he was the founder of the first ever collective effort of modern artists and art lovers in Sri Lanka, the ’43 Group. More than even all this, it was Lionel Wendt who channelled national art into a new venue. There are many practitioners of the art in the country. It is those who bring about change and veer art into new directions, who gift society something precious and new, who are treasured and valued in the world, constantly remembered and always honoured.”
With that paragraph installed in the preface, the biographical text ambles along the pages with rare photographs of Wendt himself and the ones he had captured. Plus, Wendt was a barrister by profession. He earned the reputation of an international photographer owing to his work exhibited in London under the sponsorship of Leica Cameras, a rare honour. Flipping through the book – rather than reading – one may feel that the legendary artist deserves far more than a printed biography. He deserves a museum.
That’s where the LWMF fits in. Established as a charitable trust in 1946, the Fund came to be under the patronage of Harold Peiris later on. Peiris, a close associate of Lionel Wendt, was genuinely interested in preserving his friend’s legacy for posterity.
The preservation has one major objective: development of the arts by stimulating an interest in it, as a press release from the Lionel Wendt Art Centre indicates.
Consequently, Lionel Wendt’s residence, Alborodo, was offered to set up the Lionel Wendt Art Centre. That was 1953 – nine years after Wendt passed away - and Sri Lankan art has come a long way since then. The Art Centre, where his legendary work is showcased, will not suffice. The LWMF wants to go a step beyond.
As the only official organisation dedicated to preserving the Lionel Wendt legacy, the LWMF is now engaged in establishing an archive in memory of the iconic artiste.
The Archive accommodates an exclusive collection of photographs, audio-visual material such as filmed oral history interviews, publications and other memorabilia related to the artiste’s life. Work on a digital archive of the LWMF collection of photographs has already commenced, according to the Lionel Wendt Art Centre.
Art historian Sharmini Pereira has been entrusted with the job of the LWMF Archive Chief Curator. Pereira’s role includes cataloguing the photographs and overseeing an extensive conservation and training project. Johann Peiris, a musician and sociologist, is also under the LWMF employ to collaborate with the Chief Curator in the capacity of Research Assistant. He will be in charge of sourcing and documenting material for the Archive. Peiris will also research on Wendt’s contribution to and the interests of music.
Space will be reserved for the purpose of a permanent gallery. The same space will offer research facility to shelter the archival material. This facility will be open to the researchers and Wendt enthusiasts.
“The LWMF is dedicated to making this Archive the most comprehensive record of the work of a truly great photographer and is making an appeal for any relevant material such as Lionel Wendt’s photographic work, books, music scores, press cuttings, articles, magazines and other publications and documents with his work or references to him as well as exhibition and theatre performance catalogues, reviews and any memorabilia. Any references to Harold Peiris and others who were closely associated with Lionel Wendt and the Centre will also be of great use,” notes the Lionel Wendt Art Centre release.
A register with details of the donor and the material donated will be maintained. Interested parties can email [email protected].
