OpenArc first SL Software Company in Japan

OpenArc Systems Management (www.openarc.lk), a pioneer in providing software solutions to the banking and finance industry in Sri Lanka launched its subsidiary company in Japan recently.
OpenArc Systems Japan will operate with its regional headquarters in Tokyo catering primarily to embedded software development market in Japan and also develop close partnership with leading Japanese finance companies operating in regional markets in Asia Pacific to assist them in implementing Finance software solutions designed and develop by OpenArc, Chairman/CEO of OpenArc, Daya Hettiarachchi said.
OpenArc is the only Sri Lankan Software company which has attracted direct Japanese investments to the country and it is a company with two Japanese Directors, Tomohide Abe and Masami Awano who are now actively involved in promoting OpenArc Software business in Japan.
With its presence in Japan, the company will be able to open new avenues to Sri Lankan Software Engineers to enter in to Japanese market particularly in the field of Embedded Software Engineering, he added.
"With our close relationship with University of Moratuwa which is one of the best Engineering Universities in Sri Lanka with proven track record in world class software competitions such as Google Summer of Codes where the University students have won World's Best awards continuously in the recent past, we are hoping to build a new generation embedded software engineering community in Sri Lanka with the intention of primarily catering to this market," Daya Hettiarachchi added.
At OpenArc School which is the only private sector education partner to University of Moratuwa for conducting their external BIT degree, we have already launched Japanese language classes for the students to learn practical Japanese language which is an essential part of employment and developing work relationships with Japanese companies. OpenArc is the only software company and the IT School in Sri Lanka operating under one roof and we call this an 'IT Industrial Campus'.
Our intention is to mix the students with Practicing Software Engineers and engage them in practical software development projects while doing their studies and at the early stage of their student life. This is a unique environment where we use the motto 'Work First, Degree Next'.
The best students get employment opportunities at the software company, OpenArc Systems Management. This is an open completion for all the students who have enthusiasm in 'coding' or in common terms what we call 'programming'.
