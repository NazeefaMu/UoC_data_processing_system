Killer of Rathgama PS Chairman further remanded

Galle Additional Magistrate Asanga Hettiarachchi further remanded Aruma Handi Janith Madusanka, alias Podi Lessie, who was indicted for the murder of former Rathgama Pradeshiya Sabha Chairman Manoj Mendis, until August 8, when he was produced before her yesterday.
Podi Lessie was accused of killing former Rathgama PS chairman on March 23, while causing severe injuries to Kalumith Sanath Wasantha.
He was arrested by Galle Police while he was evading police arrest and was remanded following production to Courts. Later, he was granted bail from the Galle High Court.
However, as he repeatedly dodged appearance in Court, in breach of bail conditions, his bail award was cancelled and warrants were issued on him.
Subsequently, he was again arrested by Ambalangoda Police in respect of a triple murder which occurred in the Ambalangoda Police Division and again remanded when he was produced before Galle High Court on February 9.
The suspect was also indicted at Balapititya High Court in respect of the Amabalangoda triple murder.
