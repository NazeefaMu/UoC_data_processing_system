Ragging complaints hotline by UGC

The University Grants Commission (UGC) yesterday announced in a press release that it has set up an online complaints mechanism so that any member of the university community can quickly lodge complaints about ragging, harassment, intimidation, and bullying. The Commission claimed that every complaint will be investigated and that victims will be offered support and aid.Any member of the university, be they students, academics, non-academic staff, or administrative staff, can lodge a complaint by going to the UGC website or calling the UGC.
Once a complaint has been lodged university personnel are notified and investigations can begin. Vice-Chancellors, Senior Student Counselors, Deans, Heads of Department, and Staff of the Gender Equity Centre are responsible for responding to complaints.
The UGC has instructed authorities in universities to support victims and complainants once complaints are lodged. It has also instructed universities to offer counseling.
People who make false complaints will be subjected to disciplinary measures.
