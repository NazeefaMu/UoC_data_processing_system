MPs selling their vehicle permits
‘Government incurred Rs.7-billion loss’

The government had incurred a loss of Rs.7 billion due to 100 parliamentarians selling their vehicle permits, Government Medical Officers’ Association (GMOA) Secretary Dr. Haritha Aluthge said.
He was addressing a press conference at the GMOA Headquarters in Colombo, yesterday.
Finance Minister Managala Samaraweera was on the top of the list of MPs who sold their vehicle permits, he said.
Dr. Aluthge said that an investigation should be conducted to identify the ministers who imported luxury vehicles through supplementary estimates this year. The government also increased MPs’ allowances by Rs.100,000 this year, he added.
The provision of vehicle permits to public servants had been halted, he said and added that additional restrictions had been placed on the public to purchase electrical and electronic equipment.
