Colombo Chief Magistrate Ranga Dissanayake yesterday temporarily suspended all orders given on the request made by Senior State Counsel Lakmini Girihagama regarding the case filed against MP Ravi Karunanayake.
This is for allegedly providing false evidence before the Presidential Commission of Inquiry appointed to Investigate into the Treasury Bond issue on August 20, 2016. Senior State Counsel Lakmini Girihagama with State Counsel Nadee Suwadurugoda appeared on behalf of the Attorney General. President’s Counsel Shavendra Fernando appearing on behalf of the Global Transportation and Logistics Private Limited informed the Magistrate that the CID cannot investigate regarding the Bond Commission after it had completed its hearings. PC Fernando further stated that there is no recommendation for the CID and the Attorney General to investigate the Bond Commission report. Fernando also informed that the Attorney General could have participated in the investigation and led evidence at the time when the Commission was in existence.
“There is no power for the Attorney General to begin such an investigation after the Bond Commission has completed its hearings”, the Senior President’s Counsel added. SSC Girihagama informed the Magistrate that the CID recorded statements from 30 people.
SSC Girihagama further stated that MP Ravi Karunananayake was the owner and a director the GTL Company.
While objecting to the CID requests, PC Fernando submits that if any one filed a case against providing false evidence at the Bond Commission, they should file the case under the Presidential Commission Act.“Why should we provide our company’s personal details before the CID? We cannot provide our company’s personal details,” SPC Fernando stated.
SSC Girihagama also stated that the CID had revealed that Arjun Alosyious and Walt and Raw Company paid for the house purchased by MP Ravi Karunanayake and His family.
