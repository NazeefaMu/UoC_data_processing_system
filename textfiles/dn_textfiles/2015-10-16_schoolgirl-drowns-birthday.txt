Schoolgirl drowns on birthday

A 17-year-old school girl whose birthday fell on October 15 died the same day after falling into an unprotected drain at Nittawela Junction on the Kandy-Katugastota road and was swept away to the Mahaweli Ganga.
She was identified as Sahebdeen Mohamed Asra of Madawela Road, Katugastota, a GCE Advanced Level student of Kandy Badi-ud-Din Mohamed Vidyalaya.
The tragedy occurred while she was returning home with two other girls after attending a tuition class in the pouring rain. She had fallen into the drain in trying to avoid water splashed by a speeding vehicle.
Attempts made by policemen on duty at the spot and pedestrians to pull her out had proved futile.
Although a group of people engaged in sand mining along the river had seen her being swept away and pulled her out from the river by using some ropes but she was found dead by that time.
Her janaza was held at the Katugastota Muslim Burial grounds yesterday morning. Katugastota Police is investigating into the incident.
Meanwhile, Kandy's Municipal Commissioner Chandana Tennakoon said he had notified the Urban Development Authority about the unprotected storm water drainage system in the city and requested it to take immediate steps to cover it with cement bricks.
