LAC celebrates 39 years

Recently, the LAC celebrated 39 years of service for the Nation. The LAC was established on July 7, 1978 by the Legal Aid Law No. 27 of 1978.
The vision of the LAC is ‘to create a society where all deserving Sri Lankan citizens have equal access to Justice’. The LAC was established to accomplish the mission of identifying members of our society who are marginalized and lack the means to access the remedial measures available under the law.
These categories of persons have been statutorily identified as ‘deserving persons.’ Such flexibility in the statute wording has made it possible for the application of the ‘mean test’ and the ‘justice test’ and also offering representations in courts of law or other forums so that such deserving members in the society may secure justice.
The functions of the LAC
The main functions of the LAC are to provide Legal counseling free of charge and legal representation in court cases for the persons whose monthly income is below Rs. 25,000. According to the Section 04(II) of Stamp Duty (Amended) Act No. 71 of 1988 legal aid cases are exempted from stamp duty.
Legal Aid is available to all women seeking maintenance for themselves and for their children, irrespective of their income level. The LAC also conducts Legal Awareness for the different target groups in the country.
When providing legal aid, the LAC focuses on two tests. In the ‘mean test,’ the LAC concerns the income level of the litigant. The litigants whose monthly income level is below Rs. 25,000 are capable of seeking free legal representation for their court cases. (The LAC considers the certification of the Grama Niladhari).
In the beginning, the LAC had only one centre, but within 39 years, it was able to increase the number of centres up to 81.
Legal Aid as a right
According to the Sri Lankan Constitution Article 12(1) – All persons are equal before the Law and entitled to equal protection of the Law. Article 13(3) – Any person charge with an offence shall be entitled to be heard in person or an Attorney-at-Law, at a fair trial by a competent Court. Therefore, the Legal Aid was established by Act No. 27 of 1978. As per the Supreme Court Rule No. 44(7), the Supreme Court can also refer the Fundamental Rights complains received by the chief justice to the Legal Aid Commission to file Fundamental Rights Cases.
LAC structure
The Legal Aid Commission consists of nine members. Three members are appointed by the Minister of justice and six by the Bar Council. Appointed members hold office for the period of three years and are eligible for reappointment. One member is appointed as the Chairman of the Legal Aid Commission. At present, the LAC Chairman is Rohan Sahabandu, President’s Counsel. The late S.S. Wijeratne, who served as the Chairman from 2005 to 2013, was able to expand legal aid centres from 12 to 76. The retired Supreme Court Justice Hector S. Yapa serves as the Director General of the LAC at present. The LAC is the main legal aid provider which comes under the Ministry of Justice.
