Project to produce fuel from plastic

Plans are underway to produce fuel out of plastic, polythene and discarded fishing nets, Fisheries and Aquatic Resources State Minister Dilip Vedaarachchi said, addressing the media, recently.
He said he will be able to introduce an alternative fuel variety to the fisher community with this project.
He added that the project will be implemented close to fisheries harbours in the island.
Fishermen engaged in deep sea fishing discard plastic bottles, polythene and old fishing nets in large quantities to the sea, polluting it in alarming proportions.
With the inauguration of the project, such things will be brought back and handed over to the respective fisheries harbours to produce fuel, he said. The State Minister added that as a result of dumping plastic polythene and old nets to the sea, the sea resources, including corals and fish get destroyed to a certain extent.
The State Minister said the service of SENORA and ministries will be obtained for the new project.
He added that he will conduct workshops to educate the fisher community engaged in deep sea fishing in muti-day boats regarding the new project.
