Surreal Days

So, it’s that time again. In the days ahead, we are all in for pieces of cotton-wool pasted on shop windows, glittery Christmas trees, George Michael’s ‘Last Christmas’ eternally on the radio channels and the inevitable query, “Is there really someone called Santa?”
If you have grappled with this question ever since your baby could talk, you might find the answer inside the pages of Valentine Davies’ 70-year-old beloved holiday classic, ‘Miracle on 34th Street.’
Not surprisingly, Davies had got the idea for the story during the hustle and bustle of the holiday season. While he waited in a long line at a Department Store he wondered what Santa would have thought about everything that was going on in the name of Christmas; such expenditure, such glitter, such consumerism. He went home and turned his thoughts into a story, which soon became a movie script. In 1947, the movie was released in theaters, and Davis released the novella version of the original story. He would soon win an Academy Award for his creation.
‘Miracle on 34th Street’ is about a little girl called Susan who holds the same sentiments about Christmas as almost all the children we know today. She doesn’t believe in Santa Claus or magic or miracles of any kind. Then, one day, she meets an old gentleman called Kris Kringle. As she doubtfully tells him the gifts she wishes for Christmas, deep down Susan finds herself hoping that just maybe, he is the real thing.
Davis introduces three Santa’s in his story. There is one Santa employed by Macy’s who is too intoxicated by the spirits of the season that he gets replaced right before the Thanksgiving Day Parade. There is young Alfred who plays St. Nick at the YMCA. And there is Kris Kringle who is certain he is Santa.
If you are shaking your head saying that can’t be, you are not alone. Surely Kris is only a sweet, harmless, slightly crazy old man, or... is he actually him? Well, let’s check out the evidence. Kris is kind, wise, and very protective of others. He seems to be able to speak all the languages in the world. And, he is everything you would want in a Santa, right down to the beard and the twinkle in his eye. Besides, when he fills out his employment card, in addition to listing the North Pole as his birthplace he gives all of his reindeer as his next of kin.
And yet, the question remains. Is he, or is he not the real Santa Claus?
The answer is a definite ‘no’ if the most identifiable villain in the story, Granville Sawyer, can have his way. The cold, insecure psychologist at Macy’s insists Kris is crazy and dangerous with no evidence to prove he is Santa. After all on his employment form he does write in the space provided for date of birth, quoting Jonathan Swift: “I’m as old as my tongue and a little older than my teeth.”
But Granville Sawyer is only a minor character, and while he is a bad person he is not some mega villain. The only other person who qualifies as a villain in the story is Susan’s mother, Mrs. Doris Walker, who was so hurt by her ex-husband she decided to raise her daughter not to believe in anything. She tells Susan, Santa is only a nice man with a white beard. Dorris holds a high position at Macy’s and hires Kris but later fires him after he insists to Susan he is Santa. Mrs. Walker is not evil, though; she’s just pragmatic, and highly protective of the fantastic daughter she has brought up, alone, while rising to an important position at a prestigious company. But eventually she comes to believe in Kris too.
To make a not-so-long story shorter (and not caring about spoilers since the story is 70 years old), when Kringle ends up in danger of being sent to an institution for mental illness a young lawyer named Fred Gailey who lives next door to Susan and her mother takes up the case and tries to prove Santa is real in a court of law.
And so, at one point, Fred tells Doris he doesn’t mind getting fired from his current law firm for taking Kris Kringle’s case. He will just start his own firm instead. Doris disapproves and asks what kind of cases he thinks he will get. Fred responds: “Oh, probably other people who are being pushed around like Kris. That’s the only fun in law anyway.”
This leads to an argument between the couple about the intangibles that Doris thinks reason and common sense show to be of lesser value. Fred responds: “It’s not just Kris that’s on trial, it’s everything he stands for. It’s kindness and joy and love and all the other intangibles.”
So begins the trial of the century, in which, somehow, reason and belief must be made compatible. Just as when Fred begins to think he is about to lose his case, however, Fate intervenes. A bunch of postal workers realize they can dump their bags of “Dear Santa” letters at the courthouse because Kris lives there now. Fred realizes the delivery serves as proof that Kris must be the one-and-only Santa Claus and wins the case.
By the time the story ends Kris Kringle has achieved his goal. He has renewed the spirit of Christmas, the spirit of giving and kindness. He accomplishes this, especially with Doris and Susan, which he feels is a great victory. He ends up teaching Susan what it’s like to believe in something that doesn’t make sense.
If you are still skeptical, though, let me quote Fred: “Look Doris, someday you’re going to find that your way of facing this realistic world just doesn’t work. And when you do, don’t overlook those lovely intangibles. You’ll discover those are the only things that are worthwhile.”
So, yes, call me a romantic but I would fall for ‘Miracle on 34th Street’ every time I read it. Now that it’s December it’s hard to resist this heartwarming story about generosity, imagination, and the spirit of Christmas.
