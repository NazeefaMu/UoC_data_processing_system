Somerset beat Middlesex but rain sees three games called off

LONDON, Sunday: Somerset beat Middlesex on a rain-hit day in the T20 Blast as Lewis Gregory hit 62 and then took four wickets.
Half-centuries from Peter Trego (60 from 31 balls) and Gregory (62 from 26) helped the hosts win by 38 runs (DLS).
Sunday’s action was otherwise spoiled by wet weather, with three of the four scheduled fixtures being abandoned.
No balls were bowled at Sussex’s match at home to Hampshire, Kent’s trip to Glamorgan or Lancashire’s visit to Worcestershire.
Somerset’s victory lifted them up to third in the South Group, while Middlesex stay seventh with just two wins from seven matches.
