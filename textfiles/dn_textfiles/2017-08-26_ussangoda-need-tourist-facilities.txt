Ussangoda in need of tourist facilities

Local and foreign tourists who visit Ussangoda valley face untold difficulties since the location lacks facilities.
The valley sprawls over 460 acres. Declared a national park in 2010, the valley lies close to the Kalametiya sanctuary reputed for endemic and migratory birds. Reckless visitors harm natural beauty by removing rare ayurvedic herbs and other valuables. The location lacks a vehicle parking. The residents of the area complain that some people engage various illegal activities in the Ussangoda valley.
Plans were drawn up to provide a vehicle park and other facilities but those have not been realized yet, the residents said.
