UNP against postponement of LG polls

The United National Party yesterday vowed to defeat any attempts to further postpone elections to the local authorities.
UNP General secretary Minister Kabhir Hashim in a statement said the party will give leadership to all pro-democracy forces to ensure that the people’s legal right to elect their representatives to the local authorities are not violated.
The statement further pointed out that the UNP will do everything in its power to hold the Local Government election on time which would ensure the people’s right to elect representatives who can strengthen the country’s local administration. “The UNP believes that all pro-democracy parties must strive for the same objective,” the statement said.
The statement further said that political parties should view victory or loss at an election as a way of ensuring people’s right for choosing their representatives.
“Thus, if someone is trying to compromise that right, the UNP will not hesitate to take necessary measures to defeat that attempt,” the statement further said.
“It is important to point out that the UNP was committed to create a proper foundation to hold the Provincial Council Elections as soon as possible. On those grounds, the UNP is ready to defeat any politically driven attempts to hinder the elections, to ensure the democratic rights of the people,” the statement also said.
