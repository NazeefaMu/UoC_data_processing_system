SLFP hands over proposals

Constitutional reforms:
Steering Committee awaiting proposals to finalise interim report:
Report deals with vital aspects of the Constitution:
The Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) submitted its Constitutional reforms to the Steering Committee of the Constitutional Assembly on Thursday, Parliamentary sources told the Daily News.
The Steering Committee was awaiting the SLFP proposals to finalise its interim report, which will pronounce the contours of Constitutional reforms. The report, which deals with vital aspects of the Constitution including electoral reforms, devolution of power and nature of the State is expected in the Constitutional Assembly this month.
Steering Committee sources confirming that it received the SLFP proposals from Minister Nimal Siripala de Silva said those would be put before the committee at its next round of meeting scheduled from September 6.
The Steering Committee has been ready with the interim report since December last year, but its presentation delayed because the SLFP was bidding more time to articulate its position on constitutional reforms.
Ministers Nimal Siripala, Dilan Perera and Susil Premajayantha are representing the SLFP at the Steering Committee headed by the Prime Minister. Many SLFP stalwarts over the past months insisted that the Executive Presidency should not be abolished and that they were not in favour of any Amendment that requires a referendum.
The SLFP proposals will be important in reaching common ground as to whether there will be a new Constitution or only an Amendment.
