EPDP demands action against crime in North
EPDP Leader MP Douglas Devananda in Parliament yesterday demanded to know what action the government would take to stop organized killings, robberies, abductions and drug addictions in the North.
The MP making a special statement under Standing Order 23 (2), said that people in the North who had been battered by the 30-year long war, were now suffering from anti-social activities in the region.
The peoples trust placed on the government has eroded due to the failure of the government to take action against those who were responsible for these crimes. The people have been disturbed due to these activities.
A 13-year-old school girl in Vavuniya had been raped and murdered recently. The incident has sparked protests across the North-East condemning the rising incidences of sexual violence against women within the community and demanding the perpetrators to be brought to justice.
The violence against women had increased as a result of domestic violence due to drug addictions. Therefore, the government should take immediate steps to address this issue.
SLTB to handle vehicle emission testing
Transport and Civil Aviation Deputy Minister Ashok Abeysinghe said in Parliament yesterday, that vehicle emission testing would be taken over from two private companies and handed over to the Sri Lanka Transport Board Depots.
Responding to a question raised by JVP MP Dr. Nalinda Jayatissa, the Deputy Minister said that the authority to issue vehicle emission certificates have been given to two private companies Cleanco Lanka Private Company and Laugfs Eco Sri Private Company which has earned Rs. 8,596,434,123 by issuing such certificates since 2008.

Raising a supplementary question, JVP leader Anura Kumara Dissanayake demanded to know as to why the government which issued national identity cards and driving licences, were unable to issue vehicle emission certificates. He pointed out that a huge sum of money spent out of government's revenue as the government had outsourced the process of issuing vehicle emission certificates.
Deputy Minister Abeysinghe said that the time of duration provided to the two companies to issue certificates had lapsed this year and the authority to issue certificates would be handed over to the SLTB hereafter.
Akila at loggerheads with Peshala over appointments
Education Minister Akila Viraj Kariyawasam yesterday, said that Provincial Council Ministers could get an education minister appointed according to their wishes, if they could not comply with the directives given by the line ministry.
The minister made this observation yesterday, referring to a dispute between him and the North Central Province Education Minister and Chief Minister Peshala Jayaratne, who had refused to carry out the directives of the line minister.
"I have kept the President and the Prime Minister informed of this issue and I would solve this situation somehow or other," Minister Kariyawasam said. "Let the Chief Minister get any other education minister appointed if he is not willing to carry out my directives," he added.
The minister said the line ministry of education had the power to take over provincial school under its purview.
The minister made this response while responding to an oral question raised by JVP MP Vijitha Herath in Parliament yesterday.
He stated that the Chief Minister had recruited unqualified persons as school principals and had appointed GCE qualified persons as teachers.
He said the North Central Education Ministry had spent money on unnecessary matters rather than on the development of education.
Minister Kariyawasam said that there were more than 6,000 schools without principals. He added that an examination was held recently to recruit principals and 4,070 have qualified from the examination.
No foreign vessel could fish in SL waters - Amaraweera
Fisheries Minister Mahinda Amaraweera told Parliament yesterday, that there was no plan to permit foreign fishing vessels to fish in Sri Lankan waters under the Sri Lankan flag.
Participating in the debate during the Adjournment motion moved by UPFA MP Dinesh Gunawardene, the minister said plans are afoot to develop the country's fisheries industry. The government would formulate a national policy to fulfill the needs of the fisheries issues. Top priority would be given to enhance local fish production.
He said the ministry has planned to promote and uplift the inland fishing and aquatic fish industry within the next year. This sector would earn more money for the country during the next few years. Public Enterprise Development Minister Kabir Hashim also joining in the debate, said that maximum priority must be given to the fisheries industry.
Most of the people engaged in the fisheries industry are poor people.
It is necessary to implement a programme to uplift their livelihoods. We have to import fish because of the short sighted fisheries policies followed by all governments' previously. Steps should be taken to increase fish exports, while minimizing the imports to increase foreign exchange earnings as well as uplifting income generation of the fishing community.
Govt. making false excuses for not holding Local Govt. elections - Dinesh
The Commissioner General of Elections had informed the Cabinet of Ministers that he was unaware about the previous delimitation process, said Leader of the House and Minister Lakshman Kiriella in Parliament yesterday.
The minister said that the Prime Minister would make a statement on the matter and local government elections on a future date.
He made this observation in response to a special statement made by Mahajana Eksath Peramuna leader Dinesh Gunawardena under Standing Order 23(2), calling for local government election to held without further delay.
MP Dinesh Gunawardana raising the question, said the extended terms of most of local bodies ended in March and elections should be held without delay. MP Gunawardena said the terms of some local bodies ended in March 2015, while the term of other local bodies ended in October the same year.
"The Government makes false excuses for delaying to hold local government election,", MP Gunawardena said. "The claim made by the government that the delimitation process is yet to be completed is far from the truth."
In response to this statement, Minister Kiriella said that delimitation had been done during the previous regime in the residences of former ministers, adding that it was revealed by the members of the Delimitation Commission.
JVP leader wants justice meted out to graduates over 35 years
Since the maximum current age for recruitment to government service is 35 years, JVP Leader and Chief Opposition Whip Anura Kumara Dissanayake questioned the government whether some sort of justice can be meted out to unemployed graduates who do not meet this criteria.
The MP in a special statement under Standing Order 23 (2), said that there had been an agitation by unemployed graduates in Colombo on February 16, demanding that they be recruited to the government. The government, just like its predecessors, used police anti-riot squads and attacked the agitators. It was not the first agitation by unemployed graduates demanding for jobs. Since there is no proper solution to the unemployment problem of graduates, this problem kept on repeating regularly.
None of the governments that ruled this country could device a mechanism to absorb the services and skills of graduates to the public service though the government spends around Rs 400,000 to 700,000 for each undergraduate per year which is done out of tax monies of the people. In addition, parents of undergraduates too spend their monies to educate their children.
In addition, there are some other problems. Graduates who had been given jobs on various occasions since 1993 to 2016, were unhappy and unsatisfied with the way their services were granted. The graduates who had been recruited during the period 2012 to 2016, were paid a monthly allowance of Rs 10,000 each. How could a person expect to live on Rs 10,000 a month under the current cost of living?
Newly passed amendments a betrayal of Lankan fishermen
Opposition Parliamentarian Nihal Galappatti said the newly passed amendments to the Fisheries Act in the recent past, was a betrayal of Sri Lankan fishermen to international fishermen.
He made this observation in Parliament yesterday, joining the Adjournment debate moved by Opposition Member Dinesh Gunawardena.
Galappatti said the amendments had banned the Sri Lankan fishermen from fishing in international waters. He questioned as to why those fishermen sail about 600 to 800 km in to sea and return with the crop to the country.
At this stage, Minister Mahinda Amaraweera said the statement was misleading and added that the ban was imposed on those who illegally sail into international waters. He added that 90 percent of the fishermen engage in their employment only within our territorial waters.
