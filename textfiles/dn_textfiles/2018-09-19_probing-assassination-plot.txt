Probing the  assassination plot

The whole episode surrounding the alleged plot hatched by the former Terrorist Investigation Division Head (TID) DIG Nalaka de Silva to assassinate President Maithripala Sirisena and former Defence Secretary Gotabhaya Rajapaksa as disclosed by a Civil Society activist has raised more questions than answers. Namal Kumarage, a leading figure of an anti-corruption movement made the allegation against the TID Head in dramatic fashion last Wednesday by playing an audio recording containing what was said to be the voice of DIG de Silva discussing a detailed plan to cause harm to the lives of the President and the former Defence Secretary.
The CID on the directions of the IGP got cracking right away and commenced investigations subjecting the complainant to a 10 hour grilling after which it sought a court order to obtain the unedited footage of the media conference wherein the full recording was played to the media of the voice said to be that of the TID Head detailing the plan to harm the Head of State and the former Defence Secretary. DIG de Silva, in the meantime, had been relieved of his duties as Head of the TID and transferred to the IT Unit of the Police as is the normal procedure when a police officer is being investigated.
There appear to be many questions surrounding the whole matter. No doubt, DIG Nalaka de Silva is a hard boiled cop and the post of DIG and his appointment to Head the TID certainly had not been conferred on him lightly, but possibly after a full evaluation of his record in the Service over the years. It is thus mind boggling indeed to comprehend that such a high ranking officer in the Police Service -a DIG no less- freely discussing a plot to assassinate a Head of State, on an open, non-secure line with Namal Kumarage.
It could not have been lost on the DIG that telephone conversations can be traced to their source with the sophisticated devices now in use. He certainly could not have been unaware of the details of the investigations into the Lasantha Wickramatunga and Thajudeen murders where the sources of the mobile phone conversations between the perpetrators were ferreted out from the Service Providers and their identities established without any difficulty. The investigators must probe why the former TID Head, DIG Nalaka de Silva, a veteran Police officer, chose to throw caution to the winds and openly discuss a plot to assassinate the country’s Head of State and also who could be the hidden hand behind the plot.
It is also revealed in the telephone conversation between the DIG and Namal Kumarage that the said killings were to be carried out by the lieutenants of notorious drug lord Makandure Madush who is absconding from court, having fled the country and is conducting his criminal activities from abroad. This, in a way, reveals the extent of Madush’s reach as allegedly estimated by a senior police officer since President Sirisena is provided with the maximum security for a Head of State. It was further buttressed following the discovery of a pistol with live ammunition that was found in the possession of a security guard of MP Namal Rajapaksa at close range of the President during a function attended by the latter during the early days of his Presidency. Similarly, the former Defence Secretary, a prime LTTE target at one time, too is protected by a massive security cordon which has been augmented on several occasions. Under ordinary circumstances, one can hardly fathom as to how a group of criminals can penetrate such a security wall in the case of the President and the former Defence Secretary. But if a senior police officer apparently thinks that Madush’s group can break even such a tight security cordon, it must be investigated thoroughly. Madush is already known to organise “contracts” from his overseas base, so the Police must investigate whether it is within the realm of possibility that he can target a Head of State.
The Police must also probe why DIG Nalaka de Silva openly discussed a plot to harm the lives of the President and former Defence Secretary with such nonchalance over the telephone knowing very well that the plan is likely to be exposed. The other aspect that should be probed is whether the plot is an attempt to gain political mileage by certain interested parties. The CID would do well to consider all the angles in their investigations including the possibility of political interests trying to advance their hidden agendas. A full probe into the background and antecedents of the so called Civil Society activist too should be brought into the equation. How a movement which has apparently dedicated itself to fight corruption gets embroiled in an assassination plot too should be looked into. There appear to be missing pieces in this whole jigsaw and the police must leave no stone unturned to get to the bottom of this sordid episode.
