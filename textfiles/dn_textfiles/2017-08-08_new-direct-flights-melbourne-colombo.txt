New direct flights from Melbourne to Colombo

 
Australians can link Sri Lanka and the Maldives on a one-stop, sun-and-snorkel holiday when SriLankan Airlines launches its new direct services from Melbourne to the Sri Lankan capital, Colombo, on October 29.
The daily service will run an A330-200 on the 10-hour, 50-minute flight to Colombo, bypassing the traditional stopover hubs of Singapore and Kuala Lumpur. SriLankan, which is in the oneworld family, last ran direct services to Australia back in the 1990s.
The new flights depart Melbourne at 4.55pm, arriving in Colombo at 10.15pm, returning as a night flight, departing at 11.50pm to reach Melbourne at 3.25pm.
For the idyllic Indian Ocean escape, connect a Sri Lankan stay with a direct flight into the Maldives' capital, Male, or straight to its southernmost island, Gan Island, in the Addu Atoll, whose resorts include the Shangri-La Villingili Resort & Spa.
SriLankan also connects from Colombo to 10 Indian cities, the Middle East and runs direct to London. Return fares from Melbourne to Colombo cost from $815 including taxes.
