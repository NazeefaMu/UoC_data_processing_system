Calculated effort to tarnish my clean political image - Minister Amaraweera

UPFA General Secretary Minister Mahinda Amaraweera yesterday categorically denied that he addressed a letter to Court requesting it to reject the bail applications made by suspects involved in the Hambantota Protest Campaign against the Mattala Airport project.
Mahinda Amaraweera in a statement issued yesterday said, a group led by Parliamentarian Namal Rajapaksa addressing the media after their release on bail on October 16 alleged that he (Amaraweera) had sent a letter to Court requesting that they be refused bail and the court totally disregarded and threw the letter away.
This type of allegation which is a complete travesty of the truth was a calculated effort to tarnish his clean political image, he said.
The Minister said he would not consider this as a trivial thing. It was the responsibility of the Attorney General’s Department to ascertain the truth regarding this allegation.
As such, he lodged a complaint with the Attorney General and requests him to ascertain the truth about this issue as it could be deduced as contempt of Court on the part of those who leveled this false allegation.
Amaraweera said he hopes to take suitable legal action against the unfounded allegation.
