NCC appeals to maintain law and order

National Christian Council of Sri Lanka yesterday appealed to law enforcement authorities to ensure the security of every citizen of the country and maintain law and order.
The NCC in a media communique also requested all peace loving citizens in the country to take into consideration the heavy price the country has paid for over 3 decades of war and violence and to work towards the peaceful resolution of the issues that are causing these acts of violence .
The full statement
The National Christian Council of Sri Lanka is deeply distressed at the significant escalation in Inter-Religious tensions which have led to the loss of life and damage to property.
We appeal to all Peace-Loving Citizens in this country to take into consideration the heavy price we have paid for nearly three decades of war and violence and to work towards the peaceful resolution of the issues that are causing these acts of violence which are not in line with the righteous principles upon which this country is founded.
We appeal to all political parties and other formations to act with restraint and not to contribute further to the destabilisation of an already fragile Government, causing greater harm to the economy of the country and ultimately negatively affecting the poorer sections of our people. We appeal to all law enforcement authorities to act without partiality and to consider their paramount duty which is to ensure the security of every citizen of the country and to maintain law and order.
We appeal to all religious leaders to act together, sustained by our spiritual resources, to collectively work towards resolving all the fear, hatred and suspicion that arises at a time like this. The Council reiterates its ongoing commitment to work with any and all Religious groups as we seek to collectively restore peace and harmony for every citizen of this country.
