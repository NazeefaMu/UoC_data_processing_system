'Dapper' Dan was a rugby dazzler

Sri Lanka Rugby history can always vouch for a dazzling rugby player of the caliber of Dan Ratnam, who paved the way and took Havelock Sports Club rugby to dizzy heights in the late 1960's and early 1970.
He was in Kandy together with his club mate Hiran Fernando and Haresh Fonseka.They were the guests of D.C. And Jennifer Abeyartne.
Dan says that today the standard of rugby is good in Sri Lanka and likely to grow to great heights unlike in the past. He said that it was nice to see an abundance of facilities being offered to players, unlike in their days where there was no word called rugby facilities.
But there was amazing enthusiasm by all those who played the game at whatever level and this made rugby very popular. Therefore the need for additional facilities was never a requirement or a dire need for any requests. 'Some times this may work on a two way basis but over all the need to develop rugby and compete at a higher level with strength, power; speed and commitment to play to win require enormous endurance by players to perform',said dapper Dan.
Over here in Kandy he visited the Old Trinitians Sports Club and met his friends Nico de Silva the President and Alex Lazarus and also was seen at Kandy Sports Club. He was very happy and pleased to see the improvements at Nittawela, as he stepped on to this famous rugby grounds after several years. This club being the oldest rugby playing club and now in its 141st year. He said, when they played the pavilion side was sloppy and they ran downwards to score at that end. Today the club looks perfect and grand, more like an International Rugby Stadium. The reply from me was for this credit should go to Malik Samarwickrema and the committee who helped this club to look what it is today.
Dan who lives in California, for well over two and half decades is keen to come back to his motherland. He says today rugby is a fast moving sport in the USA. He is keen to come back and give whatever he can for the game which helped him attain stardom. He is a product of Carey College. During his time late Rev. Dr. W, G. Wickremasinghe was the principal and there was no rugby at Carey College. During his playing days Dan Ratnam was a fearless and dashing centre. He first played for NCC, in the inter club "B" division tournament from 1964 to 1966. In 1966 Kandy Lake Club who won the "B" division championship and were promoted to "A" division, lost only to NCC.
