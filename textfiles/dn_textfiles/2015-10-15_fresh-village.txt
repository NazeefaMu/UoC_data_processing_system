Fresh from the Village


Sweet traditions nuga Gama
Cooking classes at Nuga Gama is one of six exciting new city tour experiences from the Cinnamon City Hotel Group that want everyone to stay in Colombo just a little bit longer.
Cinnamon Grand's Nuga Gama, a success story that has spread like the monsoon amongst everyone interested in wholesome Sri Lankan village food, is set to take on this rainy season with a greener and more leafy approach than ever with its new special cooking experiences, which come with Nature Trails. It is one of six fabulous experiences you can enjoy with Cinnamon City Hotels.
So if you have ever wanted to learn how to cook authentic Sri Lankan Village food you can now join the local Ammes (ladies) at the typical Sri Lankan Village Nuga Gama in the heart of the city in their Kussiya (kitchen).
Age old recipes
Here you can now learn age old recipes and the secrets of combining exotic spices with coconut milk to turn home grown produce, bought by yourselves in the market place, into an amazing cooking experience. As part of this exciting morning or evening event the village head man will take you on a plant tour so you can fully understand the importance of many herbal, medicinal and other plants, used by the villagers for centuries, and how they fit into Sri Lankas ancient Ayurveda traditions.

Nuga Gama Village cade
Aside from the spices and herbs, the vegetable and fruits are also grown in Nuga Gama's very own home garden, and on this fabulous two hour course you will learn how every day begins with a trip to the pola (village fairs) where sacks full of fresh, out of the ground, soil clogged roots, tubers and yams are purchased (like raja ala which is sweet and purple in colour) along with starchy jak fruit, which is consumed with desiccated coconut and ground red chilli after boiling, amongst other delicious morsels. Each one will leave you wanting more and the great thing about the Nuga Gama village cooking experience is that at the end of it you can feast on a banquet of dishes you learnt to make from scratch, and you can go back home and create some of the dishes you enjoyed eating during your stay.
Leaves and vegetables
Sitting in the traditional open air kitchen is a magical experience watching the large pottery pots brimming with vegetable curries including the perennial standards like the sweet beetroot curry (which prevents the further growth of cancer cells), and the making of an exciting range of side sambols and mallums from the shoe flower salad, mukunuwenna, penela leaf to the anguna, green gram and kekatiya. You will learn from the lovely ammes which leaves and vegetables give health benefits, ranging from relief from aches and pains, diuretic properties to prevent skin lesions, eyesight improvement, remedying gastritis and constipation while even in some cases acting as a natural substitute for Viagra, now that's got to be a plus right.

Typical village kitchen       
Considering that all bases have been covered thus far, Nuga Gama has not forgotten the fine tradition of meat dishes known only to small village hamlets, like the simple village chicken curry (a tough animal which is reported to be a descendant of the road runner and fowl), the famous black pork curry and mutton curry, while the coastal belt of the country is amply represented through the prawn and tuna fish curry.
Fiery pleasures
To cool the fiery pleasures, Cinnamon Grand's Nuga Gama also has a tantalizing selection of fresh seasonal fruits on display like donga, mangosteen, nelli, and desserts such as curd and treacle, coconut, milk and potato toffees, and anoda flowers with ladu.
To reach this exciting spot, walk through the torch lit jungle, which is the entrance to Cinnamon Grand's Nuga Gama, and step into an idyll of tranquility, learning and spice soaked pleasure and treat yourself to this amazing cooking course so you can fully enjoy the Monsoon's Bounty, courtesy of Cinnamon Grand's Nuga Gama.
