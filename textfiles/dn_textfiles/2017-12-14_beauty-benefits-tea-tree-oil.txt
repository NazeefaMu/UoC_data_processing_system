Beauty benefits of Tea Tree oil

UK's Prince Harry’s fiancée and soon-to-be Duchess, Meghan Markle has revealed this natural remedy – tea tree oil – is her go-to skin care remedy. She’s not alone.
Tea tree oil is an Australian favorite that has migrated into bathroom and medicine cabinets across America for its application on minor cuts and burns, abrasions, bites and stings.
Markle revealed in an interview with Allure Magazine that Tea Tree Oil is her secret skincare weapon, saying, “The one thing that I cannot live without when I’m traveling is a small container of tea tree oil… no matter what it is, it’s my little cure-all. It’s inexpensive, it’s small enough to carry on, and I bring it with me all the time.” The use of Tea Tree Oil first began in Australia, where the native aborigines harvested the oil for use in treating cuts, burns and other skin issues and now we give you 12 of the up to date Tea Tree oil benefits and ways you can use Tea Tree oil as a part of your health and beauty regime:
Here are some benefits of using this miracle-oil
1. Tea tree oil for acne
Tea tree oil is one of the best home remedies for acne. Tea Tree oil has powerful antibacterial properties and therefore, it makes a neat natural alternative to benzoyl peroxide, the chemical used in other types of acne treatments and, unlike its manufactured counterparts, Tea Tree oil doesn’t leave your skin red and peeling. Just apply a drop of this wonderful oil straight on your pimple using a Q-tip before going to bed (do it for couple of nights) and see your acne healing. (Don’t apply Tea Tree oil all over your skin, target only your acne breakouts.) You can also add about 10 drops of the antibacterial Tea Tree oil to your regular face wash.
2. Promotes healthy hair growth
A few drops of tea oil, mixed with a carrier oil (olive oil, coconut oil or sweet almond oil) massaged into your scalp will unclog the hair follicles, nourish the roots and help to induce hair growth. Always remember to mix with a carrier oil first as, on its own, Tea Tree oil is too strong for direct application to your skin.
3. Razor burn relief
For painful and uncomfortable razor burns, mix a couple of drops of Tea Tree essential oil with one spoon of Coconut oil and apply to the affected areas for a soothing and healing balm.
4. Dandruff cure
Tea Tree oil benefits include dandruff cure. Tea Tree oil has been used as an effective treatment for dandruff for many years. Just add a few drops of Tea Oil mixed in with your usual shampoo; wash and rinse out as usual.
5. Treatment for dry scalp
Mix some Tea Tree oil with a carrier oil, such as jojoba oil, olive oil, coconut oil or sweet almond oil and massage gently into the hair and scalp; leave for about half an hour before washing out. Oils will moisturise and nourish your scalp and clear any blockages in the pores.
6. Moisturiser for dry skin (mixed with carrier oil)
Tea Tree oil, mixed with a carrier oil, is great for moisturising dry and cracked skin. Mix 1-2 drops of Tea Tree oil with 1 tablespoon of sweet almond oil; massage gently into the affected areas, especially on your knees, elbows and heels for lasting relief from dry skin.
7. Hair fall remedy
An effective hair fall remedy that will help nourish and moisturize the hair: mix a couple of drops of Tea Tree oil with a couple of tablespoons of Castor oil or Argan oil, massage your scalp with it for couple of minutes, leave the treatment on your hair for about 1 hour, then wash off; it can slow the thinning of hair, re-vitalise and thicken hair at the same time.
8. Treatment for corns and warts
Apply undiluted Tea Tree oil onto warts and corns twice daily for an effective, natural way of removing them. Be careful though not to let undiluted Tea Tree oil spill onto sensitive areas of skin, as it is extremely strong.
