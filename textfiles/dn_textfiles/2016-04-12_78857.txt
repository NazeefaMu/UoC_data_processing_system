Just three apples high and blue from head to toe, Peyo's Belgian comic book characters now come in 3D format in Raja Gosnell's movie 'The Smurfs'.
The movie features the familiar old gang of the 1980's television series engaged in a new adventure. While fleeing from their archenemy, the evil wizard Gargamel, half a dozen Smurfs find themselves imported to New York City. With the wizard and his cat in pursuit, the Smurfs take refuge in a young couple's home. The head of the family, Patrick is desperately trying to make things work at his workplace. He is pressured when his tyrannical boss suddenly puts an advertising campaign on him. Back at home his wife, Grace, is expecting their first baby. At the beginning Patrick finds the presence of the little folk annoying but he soon learns that true happiness comes from simple matters which touch the heart.
Central theme
 
The main characters in focus
 
Faith in your strengths seems to be the central theme of 'The Smurfs'. Even Papa Smurf is surprised that it is Clumsy, his accident-prone son who saves the day when he is able to retrieve the wand from Gargamel and turn its powers on the evil wizard. Likewise Patrick too begins to realize that he has the ingredients for happiness because he possesses a loving family.
There are only a few genuinely funny moments in 'The Smurfs'. One of the few comes from Gargamel's relationship with his cat, Azrael, that is, ironically, more intelligent than him.
This alone brings on a few laughs but it seems ridiculous that the he who claims to be the most powerful wizard in the land, turns out to be too stupid to make use of his powers. In this light the heroism of the Smurfs are overshadowed by the idiocy of the villain. Another humorous sequence occurs when the Smurfs raid the toy store to find a telescope. This half-animation film in which the blue folk scurry about in the human world reminds us of the characters in the 'Toy Story' series and 'Gnomeo and Juliet'. However unlike the two films, 'The Smurfs' is past using mature comic elements or an interesting storyline.
Predictable narrative
This predictable narrative formula is the real let down of the movie.
For instance when Gargamel needs a place to brew his potions in New York, the dwelling is magically presented to him in the form of a shabby old hideout. Similarly when Papa Smurf voices the need to find a book of spells, Patrick instantly recalls an old bookstore which evidently houses the book that they want. There is hardly any time for suspense because the story is scripted in a manner in which the writer is all too eager to provide the solution to the problem and does not have the patience to keep the audience guessing. Furthermore the overuse of the word 'Smurf' in the dialogues annoys rather than amuses.
Neil Patrick Harris and Jayma Mays deliver a tolerable performance as the young couple who befriend the Smurfs. Hank Azaria does well as Gargamel. Sofia Vergara's bossy Odile earns a few laughs. The Smurfs are voiced by Jonathan Winters, Katy Perry, George Lopez, Alan Cumming, Fred Armisen and Anton Yelchin. Frank Welker excels as Azrael.
It is clear that 'The Smurfs' is aimed squarely at a young audience. Though the kids might enjoy the slapstick comedy, the movie is a patience-testing experience for adults.
