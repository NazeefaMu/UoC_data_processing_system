SLIEOA to conduct silent banner protest opposite BIA

The Sri Lankan Immigration and Emigration Officers’ Association (SLIEOA) will hold a silent banner protest opposite the Bandaranaike International Airport (BIA) at Katunayake at 12 noon today demanding for solutions to three major issues in their service.
In a media release, the Association Secretary K.K.G.J.Bandara stated a sustained work to rule campaign would also be initiated from midnight today at all the airports and sea ports in the country until sound solutions are provided for their issues. Their three major demands focus on the establishment of a Service Minute for the Immigration and Emigration Service, the reinstatement of the Departmental Prosecution Unit and the attachment of Immigration and Emigration officers to Missions abroad.
“We have until now tried our best to win our just demands by not inconveniencing or harassing the local and foreign passengers who receive our services.”
