Dry rations for Hambantota farmers

Southern Province Governor Hemakumara Nanayakkara distributed parcels of dry rations each worth Rs.5,000 among farmers at Muruthawela, who were unable to cultivate paddy for three seasons due to the lack of water.
The Governor said not a single politician in the Hambantota district participated at the function which was held at the Weeraketiya Pradeshiya Sabha although he invited politicians for the function.
