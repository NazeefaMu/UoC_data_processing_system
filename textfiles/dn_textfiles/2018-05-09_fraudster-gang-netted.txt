Fraudster gang netted

Members of a gang of fraudsters led by a suspect dubbed ‘Raja’, which had defrauded several banks, pawn brokers and other institutions by mortgaging inferior jewellery mixed with an iota of gold as genuine gold jewellery, was arrested by Wellawatte Police.
There had been five members in this gang of which ‘Raja’ had been the ring leader who turned out the imitation jewellery to look as genuine gold times.
The gang had fallen into the police net when two of its members, a male and a female, had visited a private pawn broker to mortgage two rings. The female employees, who were suspicious about their movements, had alerted Wellawatte Police on the hotline and police had rushed to the scene and apprehended the duo with the two items.
On interrogation, they had spilled the beans about their modus operandi which led to the arrest of the other members of the gang who had receipts of items mortgaged for nearly Rs. 5 million. The two kingpins involved have been identified as Abdul Azam Mohamed of Mosque Road, Puttalam and Rajalingam alias Raja, a resident of Colombo.
Police media spokesman SP Ruwan Gunasekera said the duo had three other accomplices who were also arrested. They were produced in court and remanded.
Investigation are continuing.
