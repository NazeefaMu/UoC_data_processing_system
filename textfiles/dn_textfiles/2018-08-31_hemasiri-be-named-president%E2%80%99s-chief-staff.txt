Hemasiri to be named President’s chief of staff

People’s Bank Chairman Hemasiri Fernando yesterday, confirmed that he was invited by President Maithripala Sirisena to accept the post of Chief of Staff of the Presidential Secretariat.
Fernando, when contacted by the Daily News over media reports that he was to be appointed as Chief of Staff of the Presidential Secretariat next week in addition to his present position as People’s Bank chairman, confirmed the receipt of an invitation from the President.
He said that he had not received a letter yet. “President asked me. I said OK. When I am there, I could build a bridge between the two sides at least, he said.
Fernando had held a number of positions in the public sector, including Chairman of Sri Lanka Telecom and Civil Aviation Authority. He had also been the Secretary to former Prime Minister Sirimavo Bandaranaike.
The post of Chief of Staff of the Presidential Secretariat had fallen vacant since the arrest of I.H.A. Mahanama, who is currently in remand custody over bribery and corruption charges.
