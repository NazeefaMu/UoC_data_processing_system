UNF Cabinet in limbo - Pavithra

UPFA MP Pavithra Wanniarachchi told a media yesterday, though it has been seven days since the court decision, the government has not been able to find 30 ministers fit enough to be in Cabinet.
“There are no ministers appointed so far,” she said.
“How can we expect individuals like this who are unable to reach a consensus even after seven days since the court decision, to govern a country,” she asked. “It is very clear that there is a crisis among the UNP and the friction between two rival groups, one which supports Sajith Premadasa and another supporting Ranil Wickremesinghe, shows that the party divided and undemocratic.”
Wanniarachchi told the media that the Opposition Leader has been nominated and the Speaker has ratified it, so there should be no questions or doubts as to who the Opposition Leader is. “The Speaker has no right or powers to strip a MP of their position in Parliament.The constitution is very clear about this matter. If it was not, Geetha Kumarasinghe need not to go to courts or Ranil Wickremesinghe,” she added.
MP Chandima Weerakkody said new members who crossed over to the UNP went and sat next to Sajith Premadasa. “This shows that they are supporting him in his bid to take over the party leadership.Very soon, Ranil Wickremesinghe would not only lose the Prime Minister’s position but his own membership in the UNP.”
He added that he was dismayed to see President’s Counsel and friend M.A.Sumanthiran stand up in Parliament and make such pronounced statements.”Many forget that when Chandrika Bandaranaike was the President, Ranil Wickremesinghe was the Prime Minister and Mahinda Rajapaksa sat in the Opposition.That is the parliamentary tradition.The Leader of the Opposition hails from the Opposition.”
Wanniarachchi said that they were concerned that if a person from the ruling party was chosen to be the Opposition Leader since the President, Speaker, Prime Minister would then hail from the same coalition. “They are allowed to nominate and make 7 out of the 9 appointments to the Constitutional Council. This is the highest council and elects members such as the IGP, head of the independent commissions and so on.”
Weerakkody also noted that there was an internal crisis within the Tamil National Alliance due to some of its members not being supportive of Ranil Wickremesinghe.
