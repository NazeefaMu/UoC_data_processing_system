Wipe     	away  those wrinkles

For most of us youthful skin that defies age is one of the main things on our wish list. Who wouldn't want to turn back time and shed a few years off their face? Moisturisers and SPF creams aren’t the only way to avoid wrinkles. Fight off signs of ageing with these tips.
Results of the anti-aging process
It takes around six weeks to see the results of the anti-aging process. However some anti-aging products can take up to three months of consistent use for results to show. Overtime, your skin will start to change and the results will become visible.
Impurities and wrinkles
There is no quick solution to cleaning out impurities but if you make sure that your skin is healthy and clean every day then you will definitely see the results that you need. Consider doing a cleanse completely - inside and outside your body.
It’s never too late to try out these simple tips to improve how your skin looks and feels.
• Using creamy and oil free face wash
• Using anti-aging creams
• Protecting your skin from the sun
• Saying no to smoking
• Using only trusted products
• Cleaning out skin impurities immediately
Reducing crow’s feet
The eye area has the thinnest skin on our body-eyelids are three to five times thinner than the skin on the rest of our face. We blink about 10,000 times a day, and all our emotions are dealt with in the eyes. Mix this with the aging process, squinting, smoking, and other factors, and you have crow's feet.

Invest in an Eye Cream and Mask. If the idea of microneedling is too invasive for you, eye creams can diminish the effect just as well, and prevent them from forming in the first place if you're one of the elite who has yet to get them. Use eye treatments or massage the area starting in your twenties, or as early as possible.
Exercise the eye and face area by rolling your eyes around, then scrunching and releasing your entire face.
You can also use ice or refrigerated creams on the area as this is anti-inflammatory and stimulates your skin.
All about aging spots and how to remove them
Age spots - also called liver spots and solar lentigines - are small dark areas on your skin. They vary in size and usually appear on the face, hands, shoulders and arms - areas most exposed to the sun. Age spots are very co mmon in adults older than 50. But true age spots are harmless and don't need treatment.
Botox
Botox, Dysport, and Xeomin are all used to counter wrinkles. They're a purified form of botulinum toxin A, meaning there's no botulism risk when used properly. They work by blocking the nerves that contract muscles, softening the appearance of wrinkles.
Facelift
A facelift reshapes the lower half of the face by removing excess facial skin. Rhytidectomy can tighten loose, hanging skin around the jaw line, also known as “jowls.”
It can also remove deep creases around the mouth and nose, and excess, hanging skin and fat under the chin and in the neck.
The procedure can also tighten the underlying tissues, and it may be combined with surgery to enhance the forehead, cheeks, brows, and eyelids.
