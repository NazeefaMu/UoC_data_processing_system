Decision made to hang drug smugglers will not be changed: President

President Maithripala Sirisena on Saturday assured that he would not change the decision made by the government to implement the death penalty for drug smugglers under any circumstance and despite the objections raised by some factions against the move.
He was addressing a ceremony held in Polonnaruwa to commence the construction works of the National Nephrology Hospital.
Referring to a newspaper report that the government had changed the decision, the President stated that the government has not reversed the decision and will take necessary steps to carry out capital punishment against drug smugglers.
The President said he would summon the heads of the judiciary, prisons and law and order next Tuesday to appoint a committee in this regard.
“The committee, which will consist of representatives of all the relevant fields, would make decisions about the convicted personnel who should be executed,” he said.
The construction works of the National Nephrology Hospital in Polonnaruwa, a gift from China, was commenced on Saturday under the patronage of President Maithripala Sirisena.
This New Hospital is built as the largest kidney hospital in South Asia at a cost of Rs. 1.2 billion, fulfilling a long-term aspiration of the President to provide services for kidney patients.
The hospital would be a great asset and a gift to the people of Sri Lanka, not only for the people living in the North Central Province but also for the people in other areas. The hospital project includes state-of-the-art equipment and all necessary facilities for kidney patients.
The hospitals comprises 200-beds-ward complex, OPD with 100 dialysis machines and six modern operation theaters.
A 200-seated auditorium and a car park which has 300 parking slots and residential facilities for hospital staff will also be included.
The project is expected to complete within 24 months and the hospital will be ready for functioning in July 2020.
