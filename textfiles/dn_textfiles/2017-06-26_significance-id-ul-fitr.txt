Significance of Id-ul-Fitr

Islam as a natural and perfect religion caters to everything good in society. It not only directs man on how to worship his creator and sustainer and obey him but also changes his behaviour and attitudes as regards his celebrations.
Before the advent of Islam, Arabs used to celebrate certain days and occasions in an uncivilized way indulging in drinking, gambling, adultery etc. But after Prophet Muhammad, Islam changed that barbaric pattern of society and introduced a civilized, refined and cultured way of celebrating. The aim of Id-ul-Fitr is to introduce a cultured form of celebration that offers the following benefits to mankind.
Social and spiritual bliss
Id-ul-Fitr gives the true picture of social equality when all the Muslims irrespective of caste, creed and colour, wealth and position gather together and bow down before Allah the Almighty.
At this point we must comprehend that social and spiritual bliss cannot be achieved without a strong inner conviction. Honesty cannot be advocated for other if we cannot paractise it ourselves.
Love and affection cannot be strengthen if we ourselves cannot practise it. The Muslims are those who believe in the commands of Allah and do good.
The fasting teaches us to solve our daily problems and to learn to adjust our system to reduce hunger, poverty, and discomfort so prevalent in our community.
Islam wants us to fast so that we may train ourselves to render a service to mankind.
Let us therefore, on this important and significant occasion return to this natural and purified state in which God created us.
Let us from this day, maintain this state freed from sins, so that we can truly withstand evil and destructive temptations that are running mankind. The difficulties of man cannot be solved by erecting external structures but by transforming himself from within.
Virtues of tolerance and discipline
It is only when man has found peace within himself and when he has built up the virtues of tolerance and discipline that he can radically approach and eliminate his problems, and fasting helps us to this end. Thus Id-ul-Fitr conveys the message of “social equality”, charity to the poor and self-equality; charity to the poor and self-discipline to all the mankind irrespective of their social status and ethnic origins. At this juncture it is our profound duty as true Muslims to transmit those values to other nations.
May Allah guide us to achieve these noble aims and grant us the good of this world and the good in the hereafter.
