SLIM begins second Digital Marketing programme

Sri Lanka Institute of Marketing (SLIM) held the second inauguration of its Certificate Course in Digital Marketing (CDM) programme for 2017 recently at SLIM Home.
Registrations exceeded the expected number, which led to the second inauguration. Registrations are now closed for the intake due to an unprecedented demand and the third intake will commence soon.
Participants of the second inauguration represented a cross section of marketing practitioners, corporate and public sector middle managers, young employees, non-marketers, entrepreneurs and SLIM students who seek qualifications in digital marketing to add competencies to their day-do-day work.
SLIM - CDM is designed to help individuals understand the fundamentals of various aspects of Digital Marketing and the Online Communication ecosystem.
This innovative three-month long programme consists of five modules. Students who enroll for CDM can complete the course at SLIM Business Schools, Colombo and Kandy.
The CDM programme caters to varied segments. It is ideal for Marketing practitioners using digital marketing to meet objectives, Web marketers who intend to enhance professional prospects in the digital marketing domain, entrepreneurs who look for online sources to enhance their business prospects and performances, advanced level students looking for career opportunities in the domain of digital marketing, professionals who seek to excel in digital marketing to become leaders and employees in the corporate sector.
The programme also facilitates candidates who do not have a preliminary marketing knowledge but are keen to learn about Digital Marketing.
The CDM programme will be delivered with a blended focus on academic and professional orientation. Approximately 50 percent of the contents emphasize on theoretical concepts while the remaining focus on professional practices with project-based learning opportunities.
The Guest speaker at the event, Mindshare Sri Lanka's Associate Director, Chamith Buthgumuwa, appreciating SLIM's effort to elevate the status of marketing in Sri Lanka said, "When we embarked on practicing digital marketing there were no mentors to teach us. Digital marketing is not just a trend but a requirement in the current business sphere. The newest trend in digital marketing which is mobile marketing has fast gained momentum. The mobile phone being the most utilized device among people has given light to this trend which is very user-friendly and hassle free," he said.
SLIM Vice President Pradeep Edward who is the Director/CEO of GAP Holdings mentioned that SLIM introduced the CDM programme after a thorough research.
"People with the knowhow on digital marketing, champion the current digital marketing sphere. The best marketing practitioners who hold senior positions in the corporate sector lecture at the SLIM- CDM programme. They will share industry experiences with students and their lectures will shed light on both local and international contexts", he said. He also drew attention to the wide spectrum of activities SLIM students are exposed to, beyond marketing studies.
"The SLIM Students' Council offers SLIM members networking opportunities with peers and lecturers and to take part in national level events conducted by SLIM such as SLIM-NASCO, Brand Excellence, People's Award, Marketers' Nite, the EFFIE Awards and SLIM Toastmasters," he said.
SLIM CEO/Executive Director Sanath Senanayake opined that the SLIM - CDM course content, syllabus, and textbooks were made to cater to current industry requirements. He was of the view that "Digital Marketing helps marketers respond to and initiate dynamic customer interactions. The SLIM - CDM programme has the right blend of group case study and online examination. SLIM is flexible to adapt to industry requirements and introduces innovative courses such as CDM from time to time. SLIM is dedicated to produce marketers who could rub shoulders with professionals in any competitive environment." Credible and innovative courses and training programmes and affordable prices of SLIM have made students, the marketing fraternity and the corporate sector in Sri Lanka perceive SLIM as an invaluable mentoring entity for over four decades.
