Hong Kong find Pakistanis quite a handful

DUBAI, Sunday: Off-spinner Shadab Khan with a double-wicket over and fast bowler Usman Khan with a triple-wicket over made short work of the Hong Kong batting as Pakistan opened their Asia Cup campaign with a facile – wicket win at the Dubai Sports City Stadium on Sunday.
Winning the toss and batting first Hong Kong batters found the Pakistan bowlers quite a handful as they were bundled out for 116 at the start of the 38th over well before the dinner break.
A half century stand between Kinshit Shah (26) and Aizaz Khan (27) was the only redeeming feature of the Hong Kong batting.
In the seven overs before the interval Pakistan openers Fakhar Zaman and Imam-ul-Haq knocked off 35 off those runs.
Fakhar lost his wicket for 24 after resumption bottom edging a catch behind the wicket and Babar Azam also followed in similar fashion after scoring a fluent 33, but only after becoming the joint second fastest to get to 2000 runs in ODI cricket playing in his 45th innings. Imam carried on nonchalantly at the other end completing a fine half century off 69 balls with three fours and a six as Pakistan completed victory with Shoaib Malik hitting the winning boundary.
Usman Khan took the man of the match award.
