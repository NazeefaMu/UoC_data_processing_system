Special Commission to look into violation of Parliamentary traditions - Mahinda Yapa

Parliamentarian Mahinda Yapa Abeywardene yesterday said that Speaker Karu Jayasuriya and those who were involved in the violation of Parliamentary Standing Orders, regulations and traditions will be dealt with under their government.
Abeywardene yesterday said that a Special Commission will be appointed to look into how Parliamentary regulations and traditions were violated and Parliamentary property were misused for political activities.
“A number of meetings had taken place at the Parliamentary complex in contravening the parliamentary rules, traditions and democratic norms and practices. Those who are found guilty by the Commission will be dealt with,” he said.
Addressing a press conference at the SLPP office in Battaramulla, he said that the Sergeant at Arms and Parliament Secretary General should also be held responsible for allowing to conduct a session amounting to disrespect the people’s soverenity and the dignity of the Legislature.
“The Mace is a symbol of authority and soverenity and it is brought to the Chamber through a special door. He said that the Mace was not brought to the House on November 16 through this door with due respect,” Abeywardene said.
He added that there is an accepted procedure to carry the Mace to the Chamber as it reflects the sovereignty and authority of Parliament.
“It was brought through a door which is used by Parliamentarians to go to the washroom,” he said.
Abeywardena said that the Sergeant at Arms carried the Mace on this day in question under his armpit, putting the people’s sovereignty and authority of Parliament into direspect.
He said that public funds running into billions are being devoured by a group of Parliamentarians conducting illegal meetings in the Parliament complex. All these incidents will be investigated under our government,” he said.
He added that the UNP is in such a poor state that it is ready to betray anything to grab power.
“This party is betraying the country and the people to come into power again,” he said.
He said that the UNP leaders are now in the practice of bowing down before diplomatic missions in Colombo to regain power.
“UNP Parliamentarian Ranil Wickremesinghe should be held responsible for the present state the country is in,” he said.
The country’s economy is in dire straits as a result the Central Bank Bond scam,” Abeywardena said.
