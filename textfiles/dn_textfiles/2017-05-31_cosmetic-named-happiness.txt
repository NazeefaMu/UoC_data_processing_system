Cosmetic named happiness

We all want to be happy. That is natural. However, each one will have a different way of becoming happy. Some may indulge in sports and some may pursue academic distinctions and some may simply try to get that happiness through family life.
Please note that no matter which way you try to get happiness, it involves interactions with the external world. This would mean that because the cardinal characteristic of the external world is “Change with time”, our attempts to get happiness will inevitably meet with many difficulties. This happiness also involves an individual whether it is “I” or “Us”. Since “I” as an individual is also subject to the inevitable change, what was once happiness may not continue to be happiness due to this change?
My purpose in writing the following thoughts is to introduce a totally different kind of happiness. I prefer to call it joy because it is not created by anything or anyone. Also, it is internal as opposed to the happiness which is based on interactions with the external world. One can gain access to this joy by doing the exact reverse of how we obtain happiness. In other words, the mind (thoughts) is projected inwards and an attempt is made to still the mind. Of course, this is an extremely difficult task because the mind is so used to going outwards; it is next to impossible to stop that flow. A way to do this is to inquire where the thoughts come from.
I have discovered that they emanate from a pin point on the right side of the chest. In fact, in a previous article on the “Moment of Death”, I suggested that life ceases not when the physical heart stops but only when the life force at the right side of the chest ceases. If one is able to focus on this point, one can feel the enormous force that emanates from this pinpoint. Gradually, one loses the feelings of the different parts of the body. In fact, when you do this meditation (Atma Vichara) seated cross-legged, it will come to a stage when one feels that one is up in the air because the touch of the bottom part of the body with the floor is lost. This ensuing lightness of the body gives a sense of joy which is impossible to get with any external activities. The crucial difference is here, the joy is not created as with happiness which is created with external interactions.
Having experienced almost all the so-called happiness in the external world, nothing comes even near in comparison to the inner joy I get even at the stage I am in at the moment. It is beyond imagination what the ultimate joy would be when at the final stage the sense of the body totally disappears and with it the external world also ceases to exist because the body as well as the external world has no independent existence and is created by thoughts, and as such, when all thoughts cease all must vanish. It is the ultimate paradox that true joy can only come when the seeker of that joy ceases!! I am writing this article now because if things happen the way I think they will happen, individuality will completely cease and only Pure Consciousness (Sat-Chit-Ananda) will remain and there will be no Dr Thenuwara to write any articles!! Prince Siddhartha had to do whatever he wanted to do before the fateful day under the Bo Tree. I will conclude with a beautiful and appropriate story involving the famous Nasruddin. Apparently, one day someone saw Nasruddin searching frantically inside his barn.
Naturally, he asked from Nasruddin: “Nasruddin, what are you searching for?”
“I am searching for my keys,” was the reply.
So the man also joined in the search. After a long fruitless search, the man asked: “Nasruddin, where did you lose your keys?”
The astonishing reply was “I lost my keys inside the house”.
He couldn’t believe this and asked: “If you lost your keys inside the house why are you searching for them in the barn?”
Nasruddin replied, “Because there is more light here!”
Did you say, how very foolish of Nasruddin? Well, maybe, just maybe we are also equally foolish.
To end, what better way than to quote the most appropriate saying “First, you find the Kingdom of Heaven within you!” Please note, the crucial two words first and within. Are we doing this? The way to do this, “be still and know that I am”.
“Be still,” absence of all thoughts, “I am” the ultimate and the only reality – Pure Consciousness.
