SLFP for 'clean and principled' politics

TARGETS EDUCATED YOUTH IN 66TH YEAR:
The 66th anniversary of the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) will set the platform to launch a clean national movement, based on “clean and principled” politics, President Maithripala Sirisena said yesterday.
“The traditional UNP, SLFP and JVP divisions should now be set aside. Everyone should embark on this journey in the best interests of the nation,” the President said, addressing a breakfast meeting with newspaper editors and media heads yesterday.
“The educated youth have little faith in politics and politicians.They raise questions about integrity of politicians.We should draw the support and trust of this segment and the SLFP as a party, has understood this need. This sets the background for our 66th anniversary celebrations,” the President said.
“Over the past 10 years, bribery and corruption became the norm than an exception. It came from the top and engulfed the entire social body. The political body, the public service, the common public fell victim to this. It is not easy to rescue society from the current mire within a short period of time,” he explained.
“We inherited a country that was in the midst of a national tragedy. There was a political crisis, an economic crisis and an international crisis. We were entrusted with the task of saving the country from this situation.”
“We overcame the economic crisis through judicious measures. We also overcame the international crisis without undermining our sovereignty and independence as a nation. We overcame the economic crisis by securing the GSP+ concession and the facility to export fisheries products to the European market,” the President said.
“There are some sections who raise doubts about the government’s performance. I have one question for them; what would have happened, if the former government remained in power after January 8, 2015,” the President asked.
He dubbed the party founder, former Prime Minister S.W.R.D. Bandaranaike, as a leader who initiated radical reforms in the country’s socio-economic and political spheres.
“There are many similarities between the government of S.W.R.D. Bandaranaike and my government. We too are committed to implement drastic and radical reforms. We too face similar challenges,” he added.
