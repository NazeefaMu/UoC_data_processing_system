Poem right on track

 The Annasi and Kadalagotu lit fest ‘Poem of the year’ has closed entries and selected 60 poems. A team of judges led by Shanthi Dias (former principal of Methodist College) will now reduce the 60 to 10 as a short list and that 10 will be invited to come on stage at A & K on May 14 at 1230 and read their poems. All students who sent poems to the competition will receive invitations.
The three finalists would be announced at the event and in a simple ceremony the prizes will be distributed.
