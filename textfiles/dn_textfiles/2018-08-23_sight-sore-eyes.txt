SIGHT FOR SORE eyes!

Defining a concealer
A concealer is a flesh-toned cosmetic stick used to cover spots, blemishes, and dark under-eye circles
When to apply concealer in a make up routine
One needs to apply a concealer to conceal blemishes or dark spots. You may apply concealer to your entire face if desired right after primer but in most cases all you need to do is cover areas of uneven tone, acne, and other blemishes. Dab gently with a finger, concealer brush, or sponge until you cannot see the break between concealer and the surrounding.
Determining the shade of your concealer
For the under eye area, be sure to select a shade of concealer that is no more than one or two shades lighter than your natural skin tone to avoid an obvious white circle around the eye area. For your face, select a concealer that matches the colour of your foundation exactly.
Amount of application
Concealers come in many different forms. There are sticks, potted creams, and pencils. These all offer different types of coverage, and some may be better for certain skin types than others.
If you have large pores and oily skin, you may want to avoid cream or stick concealers, as they may make your pores look bigger. Look for a liquid concealer instead. Use a pencil concealer for acne, as the pointed edge makes it easier to apply around the acne spots. Thicker, cream concealers are also effective as they can be moulded and blended over the blemish.
Be sure to apply your concealer all the way to the very base of your lash line, directly under your waterline. Dotting concealer under your eye in a U-shape will appear less natural, and it may be noticeable in photographs.
Setting concealer
When you are certain all your dark spots and under eye circles have been covered and blended, add a layer of foundation over the top of your concealer. To kill two birds with one stone, use a loose or compact powder foundation. You can also use a cream or liquid foundation, but you will have to add an additional setting powder over the top.
Spread your foundation over the entirety of your face. Use a translucent setting powder with a large brush over the top of your foundation to set it for a solid 12 hours.
Use a brush to reach the inside corners of your eyes and under your lash line. Make sure that you cover every part of your face that also has concealer.
Dab a little extra powder over the areas where you put concealer to make sure that they won’t run off over the course of the day.
Tips to conceal under eye dark circles
Dark circles tend to be blue or gray in colour. To conceal them you need to apply a colour that’s opposite on the colour wheel, which would be peach or orange.
If you have fair skin, choose a light to medium peach colour. For medium to dark skin, pick a dark peach or orange colour. When choosing a concealer go for a shade that is one or two shades darker than your skin colour. It’s really important to pick a darker shade, so it actually hides your dark circles. Apply the concealer in an upside down triangle with your ring finger, low enough under the eyes to completely cover the area. Don’t worry about your under eyes looking orange, we will blend it out in the next step.
Eye make up for those with under eye dark circles
Warmer eye shadow colours flatter dark circles by adding softness. Look for peachy, orangey, and bronzy colours.
