The  Cauldron innovations

The Cauldron is a cozy café for the dreamers and the big thinkers, hidden in a corner of Stratford Avenue of Kirulapone fondly known as Dian Gomez’s Gandhara Street. The café introduced to Colombo an interesting fusion menu. Their innovative dishes including the Pol Roti Kottu, Pol Roti Burgers, Kochchi and Smoked Chicken Waffles, Waffles Stuffed with Chicken Ham, Potato and Cheese and their very own Homemade Meatball Spaghetti have become the talk of the town.
Add to that the crazy concoctions of drinks on the menu including a Hot Chocolate with floating bits of Marshmallow goodness, a Kiwi crush that is ideal to beat the Sri Lankan heat and many more have created quite a loyal fan base. 
The Cauldron continues to innovate and surprise their customers as they introduce more exciting dishes this month. The Umbalakada (Maldive Fish), Pol Sambol and Egg Fried Rice Served with their Cauldron Gravy which is made to a secret vegetarian recipe has been introduced on their new menu, along with the Seafood version of the Pol Roti Kottu. A Spicy Chicken Burger with Double Chili Cheese is another one of the latest additions that has quite a twist to the regular burger.
Adding on to the beverage range, the Cauldron is also now doing a Cinnamon-spiced Hot Chocolate and a special Hazelnut Hot Chocolate which gets its name from the Ferrero Rochers that go in to the recipe is for those who prefer an overdose of chocolate. The Cauldron also introduces the all-new Gooey Chocolate Brownie. Filled with rich chocolate that melts in your mouth, the Cauldron version of the classic brownie has a crunchy crust that makes every bite worthwhile.
