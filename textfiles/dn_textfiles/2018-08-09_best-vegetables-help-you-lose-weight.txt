Best vegetables to help you lose weight

Having vegetables ready in your fridge can help you make healthier choices if you need a snack or need to make it another hour or two to the next meal. Plus a container of peeled carrots or celery sticks or cucumber lengths is quick to grab and munch on. For dieters, they’re a dream food. Plus there’s new research saying that people who eat large serves of vegetables and fruit experienced “increased happiness, life satisfaction, and well-being.” Wow. Now that’s good news!
 
TOP 6 vegetables
1. Carrots
Carrots are top of the list among vegetables for losing weight. We just love the crunch and convenience of carrots. Just love them cooked, uncooked or grated in salads. Carrots taste great eaten raw whilst they’re economical and keep well in the fridge.
They are wildly healthy. Just think of all that beta-carotene and fibre! And they make a healthy stick to dip into hummus or tzatziki. Dip into just enough to flavour – you don’t need to drown a whole carrot stick. And they don’t get stuck in your teeth.

2. Mushrooms
Mushrooms are tasty and versatile and you can put them in almost anything! Throw them in the frypan with chicken or fish and a sprinkle of mixed herbs, or add them to an omelette with tomato and chives. And nothing jazzes up a BBQ faster than a serve of mushrooms and caramelised onions on that chop.
Since they have little flavour of their own, they meld into whatever you’re cooking! The best example I know is to substitute half mince with half chopped mushrooms (an equal weight) and shape them into burgers or meatballs. Or into a Bolognaise meat sauce. No-one will notice this as the flavour gets an umami boost and they add texture to the meat without adding many kilojoules. The Mushroom Growers call this ‘blendability’ and their website gives you heaps of ideas on how to incorporate them.

3. Cucumber
Cucumber has a lot of water and flesh, and no fat or carbs. It now comes in many different lengths and shapes.
There’s one for any occasion. I use the small ‘cukes’ sliced lengthwise and into quarters for dips and munch sticks but like the longer ones for salads, and apple cucumbers on sandwiches. Ditto for raw fennel and radishes.

4. Celery
Like cucumber, celery is pretty much all water and supplies hardly any kilojoules, so it´s great for weight loss. You also get fibre as well. It’s another vegetable that´s great to eat raw with all that crunch and crispness.

5. Cauliflower
Cauliflower is set to become THE veg of 2017. And it’s easy to see why. It’s a low-density food, with no fat, plenty of fibre and a great taste. It’s a brilliant vegetable when you´re trying to lose weight, as it’s so versatile. It can replace a mound of potato mash or a bowl of rice and so slash the carbs and kilojoules. You can use cauliflower in everything from pizza bases to cauliflower steaks that you pan-fry.
Half a cauli goes a long way so when it’s in season, why don’t you buy up big? If you’ve always disliked it, try cooking it lightly – just enough to take away its toughness and make it tender to bite. Don’t overcook it.

6. Chilli
Fresh or dried, chilli adds a lot of zing to your m1eals which makes a diet dinner suddenly come alive. Research says it can boost your metabolism too so your body burns more for a couple of hours afterwards. How much to eat? There’s little guidance in the research but I’d guess enough to warm your mouth nicely for 20 minutes after eating. It won’t hurt and does a lot of good. If you can’t stand chilli, you can do the same with black pepper, horseradish, hot mustard or wasabi – go gently until you’re used to these oral irritants.
