Access Engineering creates learning ambiance for Rural Schools

A large amount of a child’s time is spent sitting in a classroom. Classroom is thus the place where a child learns various skills deemed necessary and proper for them to achieve success in education as well as in society. A stimulating learning ambience in the classroom is a prerequisite for the effective and continual learning process.
A main challenge faced by the education sector in Sri Lanka is not so much about the improvements in school enrollments, but about improving the quality of education. It was identified that the current learning environment of many rural and less facilitated schools scattered across Sri Lanka is not conducive to provide effective learning opportunities for children due to the paucity of necessary infrastructure.
Recognizing the challenge faced by the education sector in Sri Lanka, Access Engineering PLC, one of the major conglomerates in Sri Lanka recently signed an MOU with the Department of Technical Education and Training for the production and distribution of desks and chairs to a selection of less facilitated schools around the country.

The scope of the project includes the supply of raw materials and other consumables, the labour cost and facility utilization rentals to the Department of Technical Education and Training (DTET) and DTET is to produce 1200 pairs of desks and chairs per year according to the standard proposed by the Ministry of Education. The project is currently executed in number of technical colleges under the Department of Technical Education and Training (DTET) and a total of 200 pairs of desks and chairs have been already distributed among 06 schools in Hambantota, Walasmulla, Horana, Kegalle and Kamburupitiya. It is scheduled to distribute the total of 1200 pairs of desks and chairs among a selection of 36 schools within the year 2017. “The ability to learn in a tranquil and undisturbed environment is a gift that should be experienced by all children.
Most of the rural schools in Sri Lanka are unable to procure the required infrastructure from the available funds. We consider it a pleasure to be able to initiate this project which has direct benefit to the children of today and tomorrow” Said General Manager; Srimal Fernando
