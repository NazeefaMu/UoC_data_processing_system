Colombo city hotels to add 1,500 star class rooms by end 2017

Colombo city including Mount Lavinia will see over 1,500 new star rooms being added by the end of the year, said President Colombo City Hotels Shanthi Kumara.
Colombo’s room’s strength was mainly boosted by Jetwing Colombo, Manderina in Kolluptiya, Movenpick also in Kolluptiya, Sunhill Hotel Mount Lavinia and also partly Chinese-owned ZMAX in Fort.
He said that the room strength would be swelled by the opening of Shangri La Hotel which would add over 400 rooms by the end of the year.
In addition, several unclassified hotels too have been built. Early next year Colombo Hyatt would be added.
Shanthi Kumar who is also a Director of Ramada Colombo said that the industry generated over 5,000 direct employment opportunities making the industry one of the thrust sectors for the country. He however said that while Colombo city hotels are responsible and pay taxes, the informal sector which is growing does not contribute to the government coffers and simply pays the annual business registrations and this is something the government should take note of.
“The standards and safety of these hotels too should be checked especially in the Mount Lavinia area,” he said.
He said that that there was an overall 10% increase of both revenue and arrivals as against the previous year in 2016. “However this year there was a drop due to the airport closure and also due to the dengue epidemic and several adverse travel warnings. But the city hotels don’t consider this a threat.”
The hotels took extra precautions and no cases of dengue were reported from foreigners in Colombo.
Tourist arrivals to Sri Lanka in June increased by 4.5% year-on-year (YoY) to reach 123,351 visitors, recording the third highest monthly growth so far this year, despite occurring during the usual quiet period for tourism in the country.
