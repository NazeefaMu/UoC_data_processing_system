Colourless packaging for tobacco products

 
The Cabinet of Ministers approved to amend the National Authority on Tobacco and Alcohol Act which suggests to introduce the 'Standard Packaging' (Colourless) for tobacco products.
Accordingly the standard packaging will only allow two colours, black and white. 
No mark except for the trade name, product name, quantity of the production and information or mark determined or made compulsory by the government such as health warnings will be allowed. 
Health, Nutrition and Indigenous Medicine Minister Rajitha Senaratne made this proposal intending to reduce product attraction in order to reduce deaths caused by the use of tobacco in the future.
