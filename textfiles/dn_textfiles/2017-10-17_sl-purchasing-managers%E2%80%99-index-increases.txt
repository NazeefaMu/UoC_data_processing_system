SL Purchasing Managers’ Index increases

The September Manufacturing Sector PMI (59.0) saw an increase of 4.6 index points compared to August 2017 indicating an expansion.
This expansion was mainly driven by the increase in the Employment sub-index which recovered from the contraction observed in the previous month with the recruitment of new employees. The production and new orders sub-indices expanded at higher rates in September.
The Stock of purchases sub-index increased at a slower rate due to the excess stocks level observed in the previous month. Suppliers’ Delivery Time lengthened, albeit at a slower rate compared to previous month.
