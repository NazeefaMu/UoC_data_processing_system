Speaker doesn’t have power to convene Parliament early - Former Speaker

Former Speaker Joseph Michael Perera yesterday said that the Speaker doesn’t have power to convene Parliament, when it stands prorogued by the President.
He said that the Speaker doesn’t have power to summon Parliament for an earlier date than the date fixed in the Proclamation proroguing Parliament. Perera added President Maithripala Sirisena has issued a Gazzette Notification proroguing Parliament and the Speaker doesn’t have the power to summon Parliament when it stands prorogued.
“Former President Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga prorogued Parliament at that instance, I expressed my opinion and that can also be referred to,” Perera said.
He added that he doesn’t have any personal issues with former President Mahinda Rajapaksa. A Parliamentarian has been appointed to the post of Prime Minister,” he said.
The President has prorogued Parliament and the Constitution is the supreme document of the people. There is no issue in appointing a member in a party which commands a majority. The government should protect the sovereignty and rights of the people.
However, the Speaker doesn’t have the power to summon Parliament for an earlier date than the date fixed in the Proclamation proroguing Parliament.
