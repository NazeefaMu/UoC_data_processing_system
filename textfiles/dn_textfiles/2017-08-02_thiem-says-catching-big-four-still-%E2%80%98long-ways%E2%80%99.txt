Thiem says catching Big Four still ‘long ways’ off

Washington: Dominic Thiem, the highest-ranked men’s tennis player without a Grand Slam title, begins his push to the US Open this week knowing the gap to the game’s big four remains large.
The 23-year-old Austrian, ranked a career-high seventh, and 20-year-old German Alexander Zverev, who reached a career-best eighth on Monday, are the top-ranked men’s players at the ATP and WTA Citi Open. “We still have to win a lot of matches to deserve to be called the next big things in tennis,” Thiem said Monday. “It’s nice to hear that but I think it’s still a pretty long ways for both of us.” AFP
