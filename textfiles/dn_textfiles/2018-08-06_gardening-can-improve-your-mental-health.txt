Gardening can improve your mental health

It reconnects you with nature
The ancient Chinese believed in order to be healthy and prevent illness we needed to sustain our relationship with nature. Nature provides us with the grounding, connection, and satisfaction we need to sustain our thriving, happy selves.
It relieves stress
‘An almost 20-year-long study found that seniors who garden have a lower risk of dementia than seniors who don’t garden.’ (Lifestyle factors and risk of dementia: Dubbo Study of the elderly Leon A Simons, Judith Simons, John McCallum and Yachiel Friedlander. Med J August 2006.)
This research provided by Life Coach Josh just shows what a huge impact gardening can have on your mental health and how something as simple as spending a few hours in the gardening can actually prolong your life.
‘In one study, researchers had two groups of people do two relaxing activities: gardening or reading a book. They found that after 30 minutes of gardening, levels of the stress hormone cortisol dropped significantly in those who were working the soil!’
It helps people who struggle with movement
Kate Hofmann, from Amigo Mobility who is always looking for accessible activities for people with walking limitations, says…‘We’ve found gardening to be a great lifelong and accessible activity for people who are slowing down due to age or have disabilities.
Many activities become more difficult as people age, but with the help of a raised gardening bed, it can be a way to help people stay active despite mobility limitations.’
It opens channels for honest communication with children
Kids naturally love to work with their hands, use gardening tools, dig and get dirty, and harvest delicious food. But gardening also helps to teach children important life lessons, like the importance of maintaining things (watering, weeding, and combating pests). And the lessons taught by experience will penetrate far deeper than mere words.
Gardening also fosters more and better quality communication. Working side by side with children gives you time to bond, removing barriers to open and honest communication. Since the child won’t perceive this as a formal interrogation, he/she is more likely to lower his defenses, speak with candor, and accept your input.’
It improves social skills
Spending time among people can also improve someone’s ability to make friends and develop his/hers social skills. Gardening also broadens one’s knowledge and helps acquire new skills, which can improve the chances of finding a job.
These are just some of the ways that it can improve your mental health, but overall, just getting out into the garden to enjoy a spot of gardening is beneficial for everyone.
