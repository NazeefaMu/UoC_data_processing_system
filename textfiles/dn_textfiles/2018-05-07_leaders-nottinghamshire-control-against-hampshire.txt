English County Cricket Championships
Leaders Nottinghamshire in control against Hampshire

LONDON, Saturday - Nottinghamshire took control on day two of their English County Championship game against Hampshire at Trent Bridge on Saturday.
Hampshire resumed their first innings on 70-3, trailing by 232, and despite half centuries from Hashim Amla who made 69 and Lewis McManus 66, no other batsman reached 30 as they were all out for 223.
Notts openers Steven Mullaney (82 not out) and Jake Libby (50 not out) made an unbeaten 136 to help their side to lead by 215 runs at stumps.
Harry Brook's maiden first-class century and Steven Patterson's 4-21 gave Yorkshire hope of victory over Essex on day two at Chelmsford. Resuming on 161-2, teenager Brook was eventually out for 124 as Joe Root (35) and a valuable 29 from Jack Leaning helped Yorkshire to 329 all out.
Essex, chasing 238 to win, started well before Patterson removed Alastair Cook (26) and Tom Westley in the 10th over. Nick Browne and Ravi Bopara also departed before Essex closed on 97-4.
Keaton Jennings finished unbeaten on 91 for Lancashire as the hosts replied well to Somerset's 429 on day two.
Jennings, who has played six Tests for England, batted patiently in a 169-run stand with Dane Vilas (83 not out) to turn around his poor early-season form. Lancashire closed on 217-2, still trailing by 212 runs on first innings.
Earlier, Somerset captain Tom Abell fell for a fine 99 as the visitors moved from 321-5 overnight, with Jimmy Anderson (0-91) going wicketless.
Surrey skipper Rory Burns made the highest Championship score of the season so far to help his side pile up 434 against Worcestershire at The Oval.
Burns went for 193, falling fell just short of what would have been the second double century of his career. But the visitors, who have lost their first three matches, did not buckle.
Ex-captain Daryl Mitchell got the reply off to a solid start with an unbeaten 77 to help his side close on 135-1, needing 150 more to avoid a follow-on. Durham's early-season struggles continued as Leicestershire's fast bowlers induced a top-order collapse. Leicestershire extended their overnight score from 301-4 to 440, with Mark Cosgrove (75) and Neil Dexter (70 not out) doing the bulk of the scoring. Ben Raine (3-29), Varun Aaron (1-54) and Gavin Griffiths (3-26) then combined to leave Durham 51-6. Graham Clark (50 not out) and James Weighell (29) put on 61 runs together as Durham reached stumps on 142-7.
Jeetan Patel and Henry Brookes took all 10 Derbyshire second-innings wickets between them to bowl Warwickshire within reach of a second Championship Division Two win of the season. Having shared eight wickets in the first innings, Patel took 6-76 and Brookes returned figures of 4-56 as the visitors were bowled out for 209. Warwickshire who had reached 439 in their first innings, were set 89 to win.
Harry Finch's century helped Sussex recover and take charge against Middlesex on day two of their Championship game at Hove. The hosts resumed fell to 127-6, but Finch's 103 helped them post 323 in reply to Middlesex's 230. Ollie Robinson added 52 from 57 balls, while Michael Burgess scored 45 in a 74-run eighth wicket stand with Finch.
Middlesex slumped to 9-2, but Dawid Malan's unbeaten 34 helped them to 64-2 at stumps, trailing by 29 runs. Glamorgan hold a precarious 193-run lead over Kent, closing on 273-9 in their second innings on day two of their County Championship Division Two game at Sophia Gardens.
The key moment was the run-out of Shaun Marsh, whose classy 76 saw him add 126 with Jack Murphy (54). Earlier Glamorgan seamer Timm van der Gugten finished with a first-class career-best of 7-42 County Championship (second day of four)
