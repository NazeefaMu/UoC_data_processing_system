Dengue, garbage problems in dire straits

Lack of political authority to the Municipal Councils is the main reason for the aggravation of the dengue and garbage problems, Megapolis nad Western Development Minister Patali Champika Ranawka said.
He was addressing a meeting held at the Ministry recently.
He said people's representatives are needed to combat the dengue epidemic and the garbage problem. "Therefore, elections should be held for all the 338 local councils to elect people's representatives either on the old or the new election system. We request all political parties to desist from obstructing local elections by complicating the issue any more," the Minister said.
Minister Ranawaka said local elections should not be considered as a tool to measure political strength of various parties because holding elections was a dire necessity to serve the people. He said the Mahinda Rajapaksa regime adopted a LG election law mixing the proportional representative and first past the post systems.
"Under the new system, 70 percent of representatives are elected via the ward system, while the balance 30 percent on the proportional system. But the demarcation of the wards was not done systematically. Former minister Basil Rajapaksa, as everyone knows, intervened and demarcated wards to make them advantageous to his party," he said.
