‘Those flocking round Gotabhaya sowing seeds of communalism’

The dictatorial group including the Joint Opposition flocking round Gotabhaya Rajapaksa is trying to sow the seeds of communalism and religious discord throughout the country, said Puravesi Balaya joint convenor Gamini Viyangoda yesterday.
He said there is a social discussion to transform Gotabhaya Rajapaksa into another ‘Hitler’ with the patronage of a certain section of bhikkhus. Viyangoda was speaking at a press conference at the Centre for Society and Religion yesterday.
He said a certain group of retired high-ranking Army officials were now going round the country saying that Sri Lanka needed a ‘Hitler-type’ ruler like Gotabhaya Rajapaksa.
This has created a serious situation in the country.
History revealed that countries ruled by dictators had ended up in turmoil and destruction. Germany which was a united nation when Hitler assumed power, disintegrated into two nations after his rule and it took 70 years for the two German nations to unite once again.
Viyangoda, who said that corrupt and fraudulent individuals of the first regime were still walking free under the present government’s rule, added that they should be brought to book without any further delay.
The government should take steps to fulfil the election pledges held out to the people without any further delay, he said.
Puravesi Balaya’s other joint convenors K.W. Janaranjana, Saman Ratnapriya and Prof. Sarath Wijesuriya also participated.
