In 1995, Sri Lanka had the highest rate of suicides in the world. The Presidential Task Force was set up to mitigate this dismal statistic and subsequent action helped to reduce the number significantly from 47 to 16 per 100,000 by 2014. However, it is still high. Globally, 800,000 suicides are reported annually and this number is higher than those killed by war or homicide. It also means there’s a suicide every 40 seconds. 2017 marks the fiftenth World Suicide Prevention Day and it is endorsed by the World Health Organization.
