Parliamentarians receiving funds
President’s Secretary should be summoned to Parliament: CHR, CaFFE

The Centre for Human Rights and Research Sri Lanka (CHR) and Campaign for Free and Fair Election (CaFFE) yesterday said the Speaker should summon President’s Secretary Austin Fernando to Parliament to inquire him of individuals including politicians who received financial gifts, donations, aids and funds.
CaFFE Executive Director Keerthi Tennakoon said the Speaker was vested with powers through the Constitution to do so. He said the Speaker was urged to inquire of the final report of the Presidential Commission of Inquiry into the Bond Issuance of the Central Bank since none except the President’s Secretary and the members of the Commission saw it.
He was addressing a press conference held at the CaFFE Head Quarters, Rajagiriya.
He said the original copy had 6,700 pages and around 5.000 copies of the same were concealed from the public.
Thennakoon also said parliamentarians cannot face the public because 118 members were alleged to have taken funds from Perpetual Treasuries Limited (PTL) owner Arjun Aloysius, CEO Kasun Palisena and from their affiliated companies.
He said a move to conceal the names of these politicians are underway, but they are easy to reveal. “Even the Arjun Aloysius and Kasun Palisena could reveal those names,” Thennakoon said.
He also said that some argue Rs 12 billion was frozen by the Central Bank. But no loss has been incurred as estimated.
“If the money was frozen, where does this nearly Rs. 1,300 million come from?” Tennakoon asked.
“Actually the corrupted money is nearly Rs 33 billion. Several members call us and inquire if their names are in the list because they may have received money from various people for the election campaign,” Tennekoon said.
