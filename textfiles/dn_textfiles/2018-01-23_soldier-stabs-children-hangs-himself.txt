Soldier stabs children, hangs himself

It was reported that an Army soldier had hanged himself after stabbing his son and daughter with a knife, following a quarrel he had with his wife.
The suspect was identified as a 42-year-old resident of Verupankulama in Mihintale, Anuradhapura. It was divulged that the incident had occurred after he came home on leave from the army camp he was attached to.
The two victimized children, who are of the ages of three and six, were immediately admitted to the Intensive Care Unit of Anuradhapura Hospital. However, the soldier was found dead last morning, after he had hanged himself on a tree using a nylon rope.
