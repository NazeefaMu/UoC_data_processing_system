Arthur needs help

This is Arthur who was knocked down and left to die in a ditch where he lay for two days till help came.
He had major surgery on his hind legs and hips with pins and plates being put in. Several kind donors came to his aid at the time. It is now over a month since Arthur's surgery but he still needs medical treatment as well as hospitalisation and boarding .
If anyone would like to contribute towards Arthur's long road to recovery, please call Anusha David 0777585998
