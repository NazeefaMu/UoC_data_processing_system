The possibility for afternoon thundershowers is still high over most parts of the island, the Meteorology Department said, adding that misty conditions may occur at some places in the Western, Sabaragamuwa, Central and North-western provinces during the morning.
It said showers or thundershowers are expected at times in the Northern, Eastern, North-central and Uva provinces and in the Puttalam and Matale districts while showers or thundershowers may occur elsewhere after 2.00 p.m.
