President slams new govt. dreams

Nobody can form a new govt. without my blessings
President Maithripala Sirisena said that although some groups are dreaming of changing the numbers in parliament and capturing power to form a government, everybody should keep it in their minds that his blessings are essential to form a new government.
Commenting on a statement by an Opposition Member of Parliament as well as a former minister who said power of the government and the Presidency will be over after winning the support of 113 members in parliament, the President pointed out that according to the constitution nobody can form a new government without his blessings.
He said when the government is working for the country’s progress by removing all barriers, certain empty voices were attempting to cause disturbances. The President was speaking at the opening of the new building of the Regional Education Office in Hingurakgoda yesterday (July 31).
The President said :” Certain media today were giving space not to the people who work with a true feeling about the country, but to those sounding off their empty rhetoric . Hence certain sections of the public have been entertaining misunderstandings about the government”, the President said.
“Some people raise their empty voices as they cannot bear the advances made by the government through protecting democracy and freedom of expression by changing the way the country was governed through fraud, corruption, waste and family rule, under me as a leader who was raised in the village” , he said.
The President said there was no existence for those who live by misdeeds in this country.
“In a sacred Buddhist land, existence will be there only for those who tread the righteous path through truth and justice”, he stated.
The new building has been built at a cost of Rs. 4,500,000.00 to facilitate the administrative and management activities of the Hingurakgoda Educational Zone, with the objective of building a knowledge-based society. This was built under the provisions of North Central Provincial Council.
