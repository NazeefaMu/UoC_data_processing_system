With a heart humble

Head Prefect of Dharmaraja Chandula Nanayakkara is an honourable and humane student leader who values warm relationships rather than seeking power. Perfect Prefects speaks to Nanayakkara who sees his post as more of a gift.
A healthy mind and body are essential when taking up a leadership role in any school community or in any society as Nanayakkara points out. We need to look at any issue or problem from various angles and viewpoints and take into consideration the view of others. So we have to communicate with different students. At Dharmaraja you get students from all walks of life. So this is a multilayered society and you need to examine all viewpoints. And looking at multiple views is Nanayakkara’s speciality.
Big brother
He maintains a close relationship with the students. You could call him a big brother. They can confide in him and talk to him about any problem they have.
“That is the secret of my leadership. Yes, I am a leader but at the same time, I am a friend to all. I am not a puppeteer. I don’t pull students’ strings and give orders. My title is not merely a role I enact or perform. It is more of a relationship I have,” said Nanayakkara.
In a leadership role intelligence and strength are important. One thing Nanayakkara insists on is treating people as people and not as machines. When controlling the students you need to think intelligently because you are dealing with human beings, not machines. They have their own personalities and you need to understand fine distinctions and subtleties.
“But a school is not only composed of students. There are teachers and the administration. They are another set of personalities you need to appreciate. So you need to see through your mind and heart. As a leader, I must know how to communicate and share ideas with students, teachers and administration. So these are all different personalities,” explained Nanayakkara.
No easy job
Strength is important as well. Because at the end of the day being a Head Prefect is no easy job. You need inner strength as well. You need to be forceful and determined, because if you are strong then people will respect you. And at the end of the day, they will respect your role and they will respect you. That is the combination you need.
“Emotion is the main thing. You need to have a certain temperament and you need to know their temperament as well. You have to be able to empathize. You need to be kind and have empathy,” pointed out Nanayakkara.
As a Head Prefect, there is an influx of information. Nanayakkara points out that he needs to be discerning and give priority to what needs to be done and make the best possible choice under the circumstances. “I need to be fair by everyone but I need to be fair by myself as well. So I try my best,” said Nanayakkara.
Nanayakkara is a man of his own. He sets targets for himself and does not follow anyone in particular. He has long term goals and works towards them. A man who insists that he has a mind of his own, he copies no one, understanding his own unique strengths and limitations. He has courage and passion. And that is enough for him.
Warm relations
“I want to earn money and I want to enjoy my life. At the age of 30 I want to be completely self- sufficient. By that time I will have become wealthy and I will not need to depend on anyone. I have done Airline courses and I am secure about my future. I am sure I can go where I want to go in life,” added Nanayakkara.
Warm relations is something Nanayakkara strives for. Helping others comes naturally to him. Befriending someone in need is second nature to him. “I am always trying to help other people. I have always been like that. Even during my younger days, I have tried to look out for others. That is the first thing my parents taught me. To the juniors I meet I tell them to help others,” said Nanayakkara.
His resume is impressive. He has played cricket and rugger and done weight lifting. He is in the Interact club and nature club. His goal is to breathe life into ‘dead’ clubs. He wants to revive them and make them active again. He has a number of posts.
He is the President of travel and tourism club and the archives club, Vice Treasurer of the Interact club, Vice Treasurer of English Literary and Drama Association, Media Coordinator of the Sports Council, Web developer of IT club and Treasurer of the Buddhist Student Association.
“I am interested in these psychological books about the human psyche. Especially about the sub conscious mind and bodily functions. I read up on deep issues such as spirituality. I also watch all kind of movies,” said Nanayakkara.
Outright dislike
As mentioned before he has a great heart. He understands the difference kindness can make in someone’s life. To touch someone’s heart is to give that person hope. Sometimes indifference and neglect can do more damage than outright dislike. Those are the making of a great leader- love and affection.
“To be a leader you need to consider your personality. They need to understand what love is. Love and affection are important attributes in one’s personality. If we can love others and give affection we can make a real difference in their lives. We can touch their hearts. We need to also improve our knowledge. Because knowledge is power,” summed up Nanayakkara.
