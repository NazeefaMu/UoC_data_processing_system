GNs submit memo to President

The Sri Lanka Grama Niladhari Association submitted a memorandum to President Maithripala Sirisena containing proposals to infuse efficiency to the Grama Niladari Service and resolve problems and issues confronted by their membership.
The proposals include the making of the Grama Niladahri service a separate service, formulating a Grama Niladhari Minute and appointing Grama Niladharis to the Grama Rajya Development Committees when the Grama Rajya concept is introduced, association President Sumith Kodikara said.
