The status of sports in Kandy

Sports in Kandy plays a significant role in the lives of the folks living here, representing all races in the island Sinhalese, Muslims, Tamils, Burghers Malays and also by foreigners. At one time all sports were popular, but not today. In the early days football, volleyball and cricket were very popular. In the last six months, let’s take a look at how sports have fared in Kandy. Kandy has established a proud record of having produced some of the top most sportsmen/sportswomen in rugby, cricket, football, hockey, athletics, table tennis, iron sports, boxing, swimming, basketball, cue game, golf, volleyball, carom, chess and baseball.
Rugby - Today the oval ball sport is top of the pops in the country and undoubtedly the most popular sport in Kandy, in the school tournament President’s trophy Kingswood College came up to the semifinals of the knockouts, Trinity College and St. Anthony’s College came to the quarters. Then in the Premier trophy Sri Sumangala (St. Paul’s) College were finalists. Kandy SC won the first leg of the inter club sevens, a team packed with hired players.
Football - Overall Kandy football is dead and virtually buried. It has been tagged the common man’s game, and one time the sport in Kandy saw huge crowds witnessing and had stake holders. It is not so today. Sad to say in the last couple of years football has gone ‘off side’ and most of the players are losing interest as there is no recognition nor any support or encouragement to take this game forward. At club level it is dead, the 2017 and 2018 AGM are still to be held.
Cricket - At school level the sport continues to take pride of place at junior and senior level, once again the newly elected KDCA committee headed by Thilina Tennakoon are going all-out to bring back cricket to its former position at club level, and end of the month will start the six a side tournament. Here again the contributing factor has been the lack of resources and facilities and poor organizing by the governing body.
Hockey - At school level hockey is quite healthy and successful with most of the schools, especially girls’ schools dominating the game. Kandy District Hockey Association affairs will be brought back to normal after the AGM. A herculean effort is urgently required if club hockey in Kandy is to see its former glory days. It is sad sponsors are not helping hockey
Cue sport - Billiards and snooker has taken a nosedive with hardly any activity. It was a sport which was once dominated by Kandy clubs. Only Mahanuwara YMBA keeps the sport going, other clubs like Kandy Club, Kandy Garden Club, and Kandy YMMA have forgotten to switch on the table lights.
Basketball - Has got back to its former glory and recently Kandy conducted a very successful inter-district tournament. The schools are giving a big boost to restart the game in a better fashion. It was in 1964 that basketball was introduced to Kandy. The first ever tournament in Kandy was held in 1965 for men and women.
Table Tennis - This game was very popular. There is some hope as there are many schools and clubs who are capable of doing well. The late D.H de Silva when he was Municipal Commissioner gave good support. Once again some schools are promoting the game.
Badminton - There is somewhat a lack of interest in this sport. Something must be done to uplift the game. There are not many coaches and should the schools take to the sport the game can pick up.
Lawn Tennis - One-time it was a very popular sport in Kandy. It was Kandy Lawn Cub, Kandy Garden Club, University of Peradeniya and Kandy Police who took to the sport during the late DIG Bodi Liyanage’s time. Schools like Trinity, Girls High School and Hillwood were involved in a big way. A big hand should go to former Municipal Commissioner and All Ceylon cricketer the late D.H. de Silva who was a live wire and produced some top players using the Garden Club courts for a payment for the use of the courts. But sad to say today this sport has more or less lost its identity.
Swimming - Schools are doing well. They have proved it by winning many meets. Trinity, Mahamaya and Hillwood have excelled in the water sport.
Boxing - This sport remains popular among the schools. One time king makers of the sport were Trinity College later St. Sylvester’s College followed by Peradeniya MMV and Sarasavi Uyana. Of late schools like Vidyartha, Kingswood and Dharmaraja, have taken to the sport and are doing well.
Wrestling - This sport was at its best at club level especially Kandy YMCA that promoted it. It is good to see Walala A Ratnayake Central doing well.
Iron Sport - Kandy YMCA gave a big hand for iron sport (body building and weightlifting) and helped several iron sportsmen to do well and bring honor to the country, so was Mahanuwara YMBA, Today some of the schools are also involved in the sport.
Baseball - This sport is catching up fast, and some of the schools are keen to promote it thanks to the efforts of the promoters.
Golf - A sport which is popular mainly due to the promotion given by the Golf Club in Digana. They have tournaments very often and are well supported with sponsorship.
Volleyball - The sport is 100 years old in the country and 76 years old in Kandy. It is the national sport, and at a certain time volleyball was a popular game. Today the much needed support is not there for the game. If the proper backing is given this game too, should be in the news.
Netball - Schools in Kandy are doing well in this sport and have taken part in most of the tournaments organized by the governing body. It was Kandy Girls High School who started the sport first followed by Hillwood College. All girls school take the sport seriously.
Athletics - All schools in Kandy have athletics in their curriculum and are doing very well in this field. At present all schools, boys and girls are performing well. Sylvestrians produced a top athlete who represented the country in hurdles. Walala A. Ratnayake Central won several meets.
Cycling - This sport has been popular in Kandy and there have been races on many occasions. For it to be competitive there has to be sponsorship which is lacking.
Chess has been popular at schools for quite a long period. Schools are doing extremely well. .
Carrom - A popular sport in Kandy, mostly played by the government departments. This is a re-creation sport. Kandy’s Carrom Association gives a big hand to promote the sport.
Softball Cricket - It is very popular in Kandy; every Sunday and on Poya days tournaments for various trophies are being played. On these days most of the grounds where soft ball cricket can be played are reserved.
The biggest problem over here for cricket and rugby is most of the schools are without grounds and they have to spend a lot of money for grounds. Rugby players get injured due to the hardness of the ground. Bogambara is like a concrete slab and Nittawela the fees are sky high.
