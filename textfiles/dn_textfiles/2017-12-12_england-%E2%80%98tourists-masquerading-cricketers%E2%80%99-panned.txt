England ‘tourists masquerading as cricketers’ panned

Sydney: England were dismissed as “tourists masquerading as cricketers” by Australia’s media which turned the screw Monday after Ben Duckett was fined for pouring beer over teammate Jimmy Anderson.
Duckett was slapped with a reported £1,500 ($2,000) fine and will play no further part in the remaining England Lions matches following the late-night bar prank in Perth on Thursday.
It plunged their already difficult tour into another crisis after wicketkeeper Jonny Bairstow headbutted Australian Test opener Cameron Bancroft in a Perth bar during the tourists’ first night in Australia. That followed star all-rounder Ben Stokes being suspended from the Ashes campaign after an incident outside a Bristol nightclub in September that led to police investigations.
England have so far lost the opening two Tests and have their work cut out in the third this week at Perth’s WACA Ground, where they have not beaten Australia since 1978.
“These English Contiki tourists masquerading as cricketers are about to seal their places in Ashes infamy,” Sydney Daily Telegraph said on its back page.
Contiki is a tour company that caters for younger travellers and has earned a reputation for attracting the booze-filled party crowd.
The Telegraph stuck the knife in further with a blazing headline “Perthetic”, adding: “Tour degenerates into farce as rudderless Poms face whitewash.”
The Sydney Morning Herald also jumped on the bandwagon, screaming “Teetering on the drink” on its back page in a story that said their Ashes campaign was “again in disarray”.
“It is the third time in four months that England’s preparations have been derailed by an alcohol-fuelled incident,” it wrote. AFP
