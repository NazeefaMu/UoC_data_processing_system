Sangakkara scores 58th fc hundred of career

Surrey opening batsman Mark Stoneman made his second century inside 14 days and former Sri Lanka captain Kumar Sangakkara his second of the season to help Surrey gain a first innings lead of 105 on the third day of the English County championship match at Edgbaston on Sunday.
After Warwickshire were dismissed for 332, Surrey ended day two on 299-3 with Sangakkara unbeaten on 98.
Surrey lost Rory Burns cheaply before Stoneman and Scott Borthwick (50) put on 116 for the second wicket.
Stoneman (123) and Kumar Sangakkara (98no) then helped Surrey reach 299-3.
Having been given a life on 83 when he was dropped in the gully by William Porterfield off Chris Wright, former Durham batsman Stoneman’s total of 355 runs in three games is now more than any other batsman in the County Championship this season.
But 39-year-old former Warwickshire and Sri Lanka international Sangakkara, went past Stoneman’s aggregate when he added seven to his overnight score that took him to the 58th first-class century of his career.
Warwickshire first-team coach Jim Troughton said: “We lost a couple of soft wickets early in the day which was disappointing. We wanted to be batting most of that first session.
“Then the sun came out and made bowling hard work. I wouldn’t say we have bowled badly. Surrey have played well. Mark Stoneman has got another hundred and we all know what Kumar can do.”
Sangakkara who resumed at 98 was dismissed for 105 as Surrey were bowled out for 437 on Sunday.
