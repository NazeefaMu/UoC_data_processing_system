Island-wide big rush to obtain driving licences

Medical Centres country-wide issuing Health Clearance certificates and the Motor Traffic Department Offices at Werahera and other parts of the island were chock-a-block with people seeking new driving licences during the last few days following the recent government decision to increase traffic fines for driving without a valid licence to Rs. 25,000.
Reports said nearly 2,000 flocked to the Nugegoda SLTB Medical Institute yesterday and Monday seeking health clearance certificates. The centre could not cope with the heavy rush on these two days and some were asked to report on a later date.
Although people who had been driving vehicles without a licence flock to the department offices to seek licences over the counter, they could not as they had to first pass a written test on road rules. Those passing the test are issued a temporary licence until they pass a practical test.
People with temporary licences are allowed to drive vehicles under the supervision of a learner driver.
