Two thousand eight hundred families sans compensations

Two thousand eight hundred families in Lunugamwehera who were unable to cultivate paddy due to various reasons last season requested the relevant authorities to pay them compensation without further delay.
They said that an extent of 4800 acres of paddy fields were not cultivated during the last season due to acute shortage of water. They said that they were paid a compensation of Rs. 8,600 for only one month and that they did not get a red cent thereafter.
