Trio arrested with suspicious items

Three men taken to their heels, leaving a motorcycle behind upon seeing a Police jeep coming their way were caught by a Police party that chased the trio.
The incident occurred at a place off the Bariyar-Handiya junction on the Mahiyanganaya-Panas Eka-Giraandurukotte road on October 17 afternoon. The officials later seized a roll of black adhesive tape, 3 mobile phones, a paper cutter, a roll of plaster, a pair scissors along with a toy pistol, 2 grenades and the motorcycle that belonged to them. There were three backpacks too with the trio.
A Police official in Giraandurukotte, the old capital of the Mahaweli Zone C, giving a brief account of the capture, said that the men in question were loitering at a firm on its payday. The men, below 30, were from the Naamal-Oya area, Ampara; the Kekirihena area, Mahaoya and the Meegahakivula area, Viyaluva.
An anonymous tip-off about the men had led the Police to rush to the location where the suspects were loitering. The way they behaved and the things seized from them have led the officials to believe that the trio had arrived at the place for a robbery.
The men were to be produced before Court in Mahiyanganaya, along with the seized possessions by Police during and after the capture.
