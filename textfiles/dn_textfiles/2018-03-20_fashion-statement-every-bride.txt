Fashion  statement  for every bride

 
Hiru Colombo Bridal week 2018 will be held in Colombo this month attracting several international and local bodies in the fashion industry. Bridal week is an internationally prestigious identity event for bridal and fashion industry. The event always takes the name of the main city of the country where it is held and as a result gains fame across the country and all over the world. Colombo being the main trading city of the country, will be the venue for this mega event.   
“Twenty countries around the world hold the bridal week. We decided to have bridal week in Colombo to show the rest of the world that the country is in par with the international fashion industry. We are expecting renowned designers from many countries,” GIDA International Director, Gihan Dassanayake said.
The event will take place as a five day exhibition featuring three bridal shows. “Hiru Colombo Bridal week will be held from March 21 to 25 at various venues. The inaugural event will take place on March 21 at 10am while the bridal shows will be held on March 23, 24 and 25. Sri Lankan and International bridal shows will be held at the Dutch Hospital before the grand finale at Nelum Pokuna on March 26. We hope to make this event the biggest in South Asia while elevating the standards of Lankan fashion designers,” Dassanayake explained.
He added that the event will attract several international brands to Sri Lanka positioning the country before India, the highly competitive market in the region.
Parallel to the bridal show, National Gem and Jewellery Authority will hold a gem exhibition and an auction for Blue Sapphires. The first ever auction for sapphires will be held on March 24 at 3.30pm at Gem and Jewellery exchange, World Trade Centre Colombo.
“National Gem and Jewellery Authority has realized that the jewellery sector has been neglected. A gem finally ends up in a jewel so this time we have joined hands with Colombo bridal week to open this market for local buyers. Sri Lanka known as the Sapphire Capital has over the years undisputedly accepted as the premier source of precious coloured stones. There is a huge demand for Lankan gems. With the first auction of sapphires we hope to attract both international and local buyers,” National Gem and Jewellery Authority Chairman/CEO, D. M. D. O. K. Dissanayake said.
The gemologists at the World Trade Center Gem and Jewellery exchanged pointed out that Lankan gems should be promoted more to develop the industry. “When locals need a precious stones for jewellery or astrological purposes they do not know where to go. Here at the exchange we have 38 shops and a modern gem testing laboratory. We have the authenticity and we provide the meeting place for overseas buyers. Through this exhibition and auction we hope to open up the avenues for local buyers to reach us for their needs for gem and other precious stones,” President of the exchange, W. U. P. De Alwis said.
