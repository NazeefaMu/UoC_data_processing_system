Southern Governor to probe unwarranted council meeting

Southern Province Governor Dr. Hema Kumara Nanayakkara will initiate an inquiry into the incident of holding the Southern Provincial Council special meeting on Tuesday contravening his directives requesting the Council Chairman to call off the meeting at which a vote was taken in respect of the draft of the 20th Amendment to the Constitution.
Governor Nanayakkara told the Daily News that he asked Provincial Council Chairman K.A. Somawansa in writing to suspend the council meeting on Tuesday, at which a discussion on the draft Bill was scheduled to take place.
The governor said: “However, I was informed by the President’s office that the Bill was to be amended and would be submitted again to the council for a dialogue among the councillors. Accordingly, I sent an order asking him to call off the meeting.
However, the chairman failed to heed my instructions. He took a vote on the Bill which was unethical and against the council tradition.”
A section of the ruling United People’s Freedom Alliance led by the Chief Minister and Ministers and the opposition United National Party members led by Opposition Leader Tennakoon Nilame did not participate at the meeting which they defined as illegal, Governor Nanayakkara said.
“I am studying legal and constitutional issues on the matter to take action against the Chairman’s unwarranted act,” Dr. Nanayakkara said
Meanwhile, Council Chairman Somawansa when inquired said he would take legal action against the Provincial councillor who forcefully took the maize out of the chamber disrupting holding of the council meeting on Tuesday.
