This is a stylised absurd drama depicting the Sri Lankan socio political environment and the way people are addicted to and deceived by the system. Drama uses symbols to portray elements of the ‘haves’ and ‘have-nots’. It signifies the stereotyped exploitation of the poor by the parties coming into power from time to time.

This is also a symbolized drama. ‘Pooraka’ (Narrator) is the link of continuous flow of the drama similar to the ‘Sokari’ tradition.
