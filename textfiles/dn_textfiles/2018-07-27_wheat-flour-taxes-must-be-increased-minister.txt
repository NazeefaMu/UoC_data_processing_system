Wheat flour taxes must be increased - Minister

Agriculture Minister Mahinda Amaraweera said he will propose to Cabinet to increase taxes on imported wheat to enhance rice consumption.
Addressing the media yesterday at the Agriculture Ministry, the Minister said the country has to spend a large amount of money annually to import wheat.
"Since the country has enough rice stocks, it is useless to spend money to import wheat." he added. He further said that not only wheat flour, the Ministry plans to limit the importation of other food items that can be produced locally. Rice research centres and the Agriculture Department has already taken measures to introduce high yielding and healthy paddy varieties .
