Grip on crippling panic attacks

Panic attacks can be powerful, frightening and out of your control. Those who experience panic attacks learn that they are highly unpleasant experiences. This week a Senior Lecturer attached to the Department of Psychiatry of the Faculty of Medicine, University of Peradeniya,Dr.ThiliniRajapakse speaks about this common disorder faced by many in our society.
Q - What is a panic attack?
A – Anxiety is useful and often motivates us to do things, and may keep us safe. But excessive anxiety can lead to a panic attack. A panic attack is an episode of severe anxiety. In a panic attack, the feelings of anxiety often start very suddenly, ‘out of the blue’, without warning. These feelings of anxiety increase very quickly often over minutes to become extremely severe.
The person experiencing the panic attack will suddenly feel a whole combination of physical symptoms of anxiety such as sweating, tremor, palpitations, difficulty in breathing and dizziness.
Together with these sudden severe physical feelings of anxiety, the person will also feel extremely worried and fearful.He may feel terrified of ‘losing control’ or of dying, or of having a heart attack.
These feelings of severe anxiety are usually short lasting. It will gradually become lessover a period of minutes or at most an hour or two. But the experience can be very frightening.
After the panic attack the person feels completely ‘back to normal’ but he/she may be very worried about what happened, and also may worry about getting another ‘attack’ again in the future.
Sometimes the feelings of anxiety, like palpitations and breathlessness, are so severe, that the person having the panic attack, may actually think they are having a ‘heart attack’.
Often they may rush to the emergency treatment unit of a hospital, with their family. But panic attacks are all due to anxiety. There is no underlying physical, cardiac or respiratory issues and relevant investigations will be normal.
Some people may experience one panic attack, and may not experience it ever again. Some others may experience recurrent panic attacks, which may occur intermittently spread over weeks or months.
People who are depressed, or who are suffering from another anxiety disorder (such as social phobia) are more vulnerable to experience panic attacks. Occasionally, a person may experience repeated panic attacks (four or more a month) in the absence of any other psychiatric disorder in this situation it is called a panic disorder.
Q –How can panic attacks be treated?
A – If you experience several panic attacks, occurring intermittently it is best to seek a psychiatrist’s opinion and assistance.If the panic attacks are happening in the context of a depression or another anxiety disorder, then it is important to treat that underlying disorder.
The psychiatrist would asses and discusses these options with you.
When the underlying depression gets better, the panic attacks will also cease.If the panic attacks are due to a panic disorder, then there is both medication and non-pharmacological management for this as well.Apart from medication, there are specific relaxation exercises, and breathing exercises, that will help reduce anxiety.
Q –How can others assist a person experiencing an acute panic attack?
A – If somebody is experiencing a panic attack, it is important to remain calm and supportive. Try to avoid getting very excited and panicking yourself! If the person has experienced these attacks before, reassure them about what is happening, help them to sit down or lie down and practice the breathing exercises or relaxation exercises that they would have been taught by the doctor. If the anxiety is very extreme during these episodes, the doctor may also give a medication to be taken if needed.
Q - How can we prevent a vulnerable person developing a panic attack?
A – It is hard to predict when a panic attack will happen as it occur without warning. But if you have experienced repeated panic attacks, seek medical advice and treatment and continue the medication for as advised. It isalso importantto practice the relaxation exercises and strategies. This is the best way to minimize the risk of recurrence of panic attacks.
Q –How can a normal healthy person avoid panic attacks?
A – Keeping up with good healthy habits is the best! For example, for a start avoid repeatedly breaking rest at night.
As far as possible, get adequate sleep at night. This is a key to good mental health.Regular exercise is also important to maintain both physical and mental health. When we do brisk exercise, our body releases endorphin (a natural hormone) that makes us feel relaxed and de-stressed afterwards. These are like the body’s natural anxiolytic.
Other strategies like good time management, having time to relax, taking abreak, these are all sensible strategies to minimize anxiety in our everyday lives. Of course, with our busy lifestyles and responsibilities, you may say this is easier said than done. But if we try, it is possible. Sometimes we just don’t allow ourselves ‘time off’ we may feel guilty or obliged to carry out all our responsibilities and duties for our families and work.
But if we give ourselves some time off / time to relax we will be healthier, feel better, and in the longer term, this will allow us to do our jobs and look after the people we care about better.
It could be as simple as taking time off to listen to your favourite music for half an hour, or baking a cake, or starting dancing lessons, or going on a hike, or reading a book or just gossiping with a close friend. Find and practice whatever that works for you and helps your relax.
