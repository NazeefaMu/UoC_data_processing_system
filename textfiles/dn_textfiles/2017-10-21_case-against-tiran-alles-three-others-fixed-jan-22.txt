Case against Tiran Alles, three others fixed for Jan. 22

The case filed against four persons including former MP Tiran Alles and former North and Eastern Provinces LTTE Financial Head Emil Kanthan in connection with Rs. 200 million fraud that had allegedly taken place at the RADA in 2006, was yesterday fixed for January 22 next year by Colombo High Court Judge Vikum Kaluarachchi. At a previous occasion, the High Court had allowed the Attorney General to proceed the controversial RADA case in absentia of former North and Eastern Provinces LTTE Financial Head Emil Kanthan.
Meanwhile, the High Court yesterday allowed the defence to inspect several documents pertaining to the case in the presence of the High Court registrar.
The Attorney General had filed criminal proceedings against the four accused - former Chairman of RADA Tiran Alles, former North and Eastern Provinces LTTE Financial Head Emil Kanthan, former Chief Operating Officer (COO) of RADA Saliya Wickramasuriya and Dr. Jayantha Dias Samarasinghe in connection with the controversial RADA fraud.
On October 18, 2016, the Supreme Court had pronounced that the Attorney General has no obstacle to file indictments against Tiran Alles in the High Court and observed that the Interim Order issued by the Supreme Court did not bar the Attorney General from filing indictments against the petitioner (Tiran Alles) based on the findings of the investigation into the incident.
The second accused Emil Kanthan is currently evading Courts and the Colombo Special High Court had also issued an open warrant for his arrest, in connection with the attempted murder of former Minister Douglas Devananda.
