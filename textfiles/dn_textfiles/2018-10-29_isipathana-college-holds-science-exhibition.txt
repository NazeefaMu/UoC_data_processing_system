Isipathana College holds science exhibition

The Isipathana College Science Society conducted its inter-school science exhibition and competition recently. The chief guests for the exhibition and competition were Sri Jayawardenepura University Statistics Department Head Dr. Chitraka Wickramarachchi and Dr. Laksman Dalpadadu of the Fellowship of the Royal Colleges of Surgeons (FRCS) Heart and Lung Institute, respectively.
Principal M. Premasiri Epa said he believed that organising an event of this nature was essential for students to be up to date with daily advancements in the fields of science and technology.
Chief guest Dr. Chitraka Wickramarachchi said it was an example for students from other schools to take the initiative to go the distance with regards to what they learnt in school.
