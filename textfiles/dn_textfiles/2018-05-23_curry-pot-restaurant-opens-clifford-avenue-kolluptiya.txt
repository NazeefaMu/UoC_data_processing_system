Curry Pot Restaurant opens in Clifford Avenue Kolluptiya

One of Sri Lanka’s most sought after healthy food restaurant chains, Curry Pot opened their third restaurant at Clifford Avenue Colombo 3 on Thursday.
The Chief Guest for the event was Minister of Tourism, John Amaratunge.
Chairman Curry Pot, Shyamal Wickramasingha said that he started Curry Pot restaurant five years ago mainly to offer authentic healthy food and it caught up. “We started from Marine Drive Kolluptiya and then expanded to YMCA Fort to meet the demand mainly from the office staff.”
He said that today they want to expand ‘Curry Pot’ to families and tourists as well and deiced to open their biggest restaurant in a more spacious venue at Clifford Avenue. The new venue could cater to almost 75 people with a special private dining area as well.
He said he was in japan for 16 years studying management and then opened two restaurants and an entertainment venue in Japan. “Then I decided to fold up this operation and launch the Curry Pot restaurant chain in Sri Lanka as I saw a void for authentic Sri Lanka cuisine.” The chances of having food-related illnesses are getting higher day by day due to the consumption of artificial food. The main cause for most of non-communicable diseases is our food patterns. “Our daily lives too become complex due to the modern society which becomes more and more complicated gradually. One of the challenges that we have to face throughout our busy lives is to take a healthy diet.”
“We at ‘Curry Pot Restaurant’ are now offering organic food for healthy living and today there is a great demand not only from senior citizens but also from younger generation and tourists for authentic Sri Lankan food.
“I rose up to this demand and today Curry Pot lunch menu has over 25 vegetable verities to choose form and all these are organically grown and the price for a meal is very competitive.”
The Curry Pot also has an outdoor catering arm which even catered for functions hosted for President, VIP and corporate.
“We also have a take away sector and soon will introduce online bookings.”
He said that also plan to open one more restaurant in Colombo this year and plan to spread to outstations form next year. “We are also looking at Franchise overseas.”
Curry Port has also been featured in Trip Advisor and several online magazines and they are now talking to more travel agents to woo more foreigners.
