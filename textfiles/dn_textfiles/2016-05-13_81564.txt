PM to address first national summit on foresight and innovation

 
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe will address Sri Lanka’s first National Summit on Foresight and Innovation for Sustainable Human Development on may 24.
It will be organised by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and the National Policies and Economic Affairs Ministry.
The Prime Minister is expected to speak at a high-level plenary themed ‘Re-imagining Governance: An Opportunity for Sri Lanka’.
The Summit, held together with Science, Technology and Research Ministry, Sarvodaya, LIRNEasia, the United Nations Global Compact (UNGC) and Ceylon Chamber of Commerce (CCC) as Core Partners and Ceylon Biscuits Limited as a Summit Partner, will focus on starting a national dialogue on the importance of foresight and innovation as a value addition to traditional development planning to achieve sustainable human development and the 2030 development agenda.
The two day Summit, which will take place on May 24 and 25 at Waters Edge, Battaramulla, will also be attended by Science, Technology and Research Minister Susil Premajayantha, Digital Infrastructure and Telecommunications Minister Harin Fernando. They are expected to engage in a panel discussion on ‘Disruptive Innovation’.
The Summit will connect many international resource people including those from the UN Pulse Lab - Jakarta, the UNDP Centre for Public Service Excellence - Singapore, myForesight – Malaysia, Mind Lab - Denmark, GIZ –Germany, Superflux - UK, UNDP Kolba Lab – Armenia, UNDP MiLab – Moldova, eGov Centre – Moldova, Fields of View - India, etc.
UNDP Country Director Jorn Sorensen speaking about this collaboration, said, “As the development arm of the United Nations working in Sri Lanka for the past five decades, we are extremely proud to be able to connect a diverse set of resource people internationally, and convene all key players in the development sector in Sri Lanka.”
Meanwhile, National Policies and Economic Affairs State Minister Niroshan Perera, speaking on the importance of this summit said, “Sri Lanka is at a crucial juncture; we must now choose to look outwards and beyond the present context to create the future we want.
Through this Summit we will develop and learn foresight tools from a national planning and policy point of view, which will prove pivotal over the next 15 years as national and international contexts grow more complex and challenging.”
Foresight and Innovation are rapidly becoming tools that governments and other non-traditional partners for development are incorporating into their work. Through these methodologies, they seek to create coherent policy frameworks that will effectively utilise limited resources. Understanding emerging trends and opportunities whilst successfully evading inevitable challenges is key. This Summit, will thus contribute to enhancing development practices and policies that are visionary, to create the world we want and need by 2030 by fostering a development sector that is forward-thinking and visionary.
Foreign Affairs Minister Mangala Samaraweera is expected to join the launch of UNDP’s 50th anniversary celebrations titled ‘Shared Goals. Shared Prosperity: 50 years in Sri Lanka and Beyond’’ at the end of the summit.
