Thoughts on Gardening

* "Gardening is the art that uses flowers and plants as paint, and the soil and sky as canvas."- Elizabeth Murray
* "Gardening is a labour full of tranquility and satisfaction; natural and instructive, and as such contributes to the most serious contemplation, experience, health and longevity."- John Evelyn, 1666
* "A garden really lives only insofar as it is an expression of faith, the embodiment of a hope and a song of praise."- Russell Page, The Education of a Gardener, 1962
* "Bad Gardens copy, good gardens create, great gardens transcend. What all great gardens have in common are their ability to pull the sensitive viewer out of him or herself and into the garden, so completely that the separate self-sense disappears entirely, and at least for a brief moment one is ushered into a nondual and timeless awareness. A great garden, in other words, is mystical no matter what its actual content."- Ken Wilbur, Grace and Grit
* "Show me your garden and I shall tell you what you are."- Alfred Austin
* "Gardening is any way that humans and nature come together with the intent of creating beauty."- Tina James
* "Garden: One of a vast number of free outdoor restaurants operated by charity-minded amateurs in an effort to provide healthful, balanced meals for insects, birds and animals."- Henry Beard and Roy McKie, Gardener's Dictionary
* "It is always exciting to open the door and go out into the garden for the first time on any day."- Marion Cran
* "Gardening is medicine that does not need a prescription ... And with no limit on dosage."- Author unknown
* "Gardening gives one back a sense of proportion about everything - except itself."- May Sarton, Plant Dreaming Deep, 1968
* "What, if anything, do the infinity of different traditional and individual ideas of a garden have in common? They vary so much in purpose, in size, in style and content that not even flowers, or even plants at all, can be said to be essential.
In the last analysis there is only one common factor between all gardens, and this is the control of nature by man. Control, that is, for aesthetic reasons. .... The essence is control. Without constant watchful care a garden - any garden - rapidly returns to the state of the country all around it." - Hugh Johnson, The Principles of Gardening, 1979
* "I don't think we'll ever know all there is to know about gardening, and I'm just as glad there will always be some magic about it!"- Barbara Damrosch
*"A garden always gives back more than it receives." - Mara Beamish
