Separate salary scale for nursing graduates

<U+200B>A Cabinet paper had been submitted to position nursing graduates in a separate salary scale, Health Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne said.
He was addressing the gathering after handing over appointment letters to 93 trained graduates, during a ceremony held at the Health Ministry auditorium, recently.
Minister Senaratne pointed out that the move to offer a degree to nurses started in 2002 during the time of the United National Party (UNP) Government. In the beginning, doctors’ unions opposed to it but now they do not oppose this idea.
The requirement of nurses for the country is 38,000. However, at the moment, only 31,000 nurses are in service in the country.
Four Nurses Training Schools will be developed in order to increase the number of nurses.
The proposed Nursing Faculty will train 2,000 nurses in one batch, the Minister added. <U+200B>
