No interference in Judiciary- CJ

Chief Justice Priyasad Dep emphatically stated that the country’s Judiciary is running independently without any interference.
He further said due to this situation, the country could be pleased with the existing supremacy of the law as well as the independence of the judiciary.
The Chief Justice made these observations yesterday addressing the annual assembly of the Judicial Service Association at the Galadari Hotel in Colombo.
Chief Justice Dep further said that although the Judiciary is independent, there is a delay in the law. He added that the Judiciary is not solely responsible for this delay.
He pointed out the escalating number of crimes, lack of ample facilities and the shortage of judges too contributes to the delay of the law. The Chief Justice further said that a Parliamentary Select Committee has been appointed to look into this matter and members of the Committee too have a wide knowledge on the matter. The Chief Justice also pointed out that measures have been taken to increase the number of High Court Judges while it is imperative that the number of the Supreme Court Judges also be increased..
The Chief Justice also pointed out that modern technology should be used to minimise the backlog of cases.
He added that Sri Lanka could look into the type of technology used in Malaysia in this connection and have it introduced to the Sri Lankan judiciary.
This would considerably help reduce the backlog of cases.
Justice Minister Thalatha Athukorala, Justice Ministry Secretary W.M.M.R.Adikari and Judicial Service Association President Ranga Dissanayake were also present on the occasion.
