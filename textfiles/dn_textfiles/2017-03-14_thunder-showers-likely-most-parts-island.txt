Thunder showers likely in most parts of the island

The Meteorology Department yesterday, said showers will occur in most parts of the country in the afternoon and the evening since the inter-monsoon conditions are prevailing over the island.
Showers or thunder showers will develop at several places over most provinces of the island after 2.00 pm, the Meteorology Department said.
Fairly heavy showers (about 75mm) are also likely at some places, especially in the Central, North-central and North-western provinces. A few showers also likely along the Southern coastal areas during the morning too.
There may be temporary localized strong winds during thunder showers.
The general public is requested to take adequate precautions to minimize damage caused by lightning activity, the Met. Department noted.
