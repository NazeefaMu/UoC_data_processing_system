Teams, glamorous ambitions and hard graft stats that deliver!

Take a bow Ireland, for their sweet big big W against the no. 1 team in the world.... 16/9 will read whatever you want it to read...
Mind you across the pond, there will be many English players still disbelievingly staring at the rain and Twickers mud soaked boots.
Admittedly both islands of New Zealand and the touring All Blacks offering mighty to their powers on Mount Olympus... for they had lost till Barrett bisected the uprights to huge relief, and another historic snatch from the jaws of defeat.
Remind yourself of the Haka, and the clouds begin to clear...the eyes sharper...kama te kama te...
Magnificent rugby warriors and such perfect ambassadors for the union code.
Mesmerizing to see a full house at Twickenham ...counter the haka, with tons of swing low gusto.
The chariot cert spurring Ashtons try for England as the stadium erupted.
What a tantalizing RWC Japan 2019 promises to be?
Even the social media experts pundits would nod them for heads.
Speculation rife about possible contenders .... NZ. IRE, ENG, AUS, SA, FRA. ...Your guess is as good as mine?
Locally it’s the Dialog Clifford Club League Cup up for grabs.
Kandy still command respect around the island as a fully professional setup with plenty of bragging rights over the last decade.
Consistency has been their exceptional brand value, the winning habit hard pills for their opposition to swallow...and that lurking feeling....what do we do to beat Kandy in Kandy?
The league steaming ahead splendidly with no big shocks so far.
Kandy, CR. Havies...remain unbeaten... essentially down to fab goal kickers dominating headlines.
CH Maduwantha, CR Ratwatte, Navy Thilina, Havies Riza.
CH skipper Yoshita leading from the front needs his squad to bottle down for the entire 80mins.
Losing both games crucially to CR and Havies in the last 5mins of normal time...harsh reality indeed and hard to accept.
Demands of the league on players, management, coaching staff, backroom skeletons, medical and family all center around prehab and rehab......in other words it’s a player environment and player wellness is the number one priority.
Each weekend is about getting the 23 fit, mentally prepared and physically able....match fit squad to drill as a unit and go through the game plan for the weekend consistency is the key through all the weeks of the league.
Kandy will be pushed to the wire this season.....and under Richy Dharmapala you need to rely on the experience of the senior players like Vileweera, Ratwatte, Weeraratna, Anthony, Dhanushka Ranjan.......exceptional luxury to have the wealth of this skill to rely on under pressure.
Add this to the die-hard Nittawela faithful...and you have a formidable challenge in Kandy.
However I believe that CR, Havelocks,CH and Navy have good skills and firepower to challenge Kandy in the middle and test them on all fronts...which means the league is wide open and everything to play for ...every weekend lining up is a crunch weekend.
The bottom 4 clubs adding expat skill to their ranks making the competition more glam and sharper.
Especially for the spectators and defensive coaches as they try to break the run of play into chunks.
Sri Lanka Rugby need to consider opening their doors to expatriat players like in Japan, Hong Kong and Philippines which will enable Sri Lanka to be a regional rugby satellite for Asia.
Priority should be given to tournaments, rugby tourists, junior tours, senior tours etc......the potential is vast and the timing absolutely fabulous....
Speculation is rife about a rival shadow tournament Asia Pacific rugby extravaganza to mirror super rugby... funded by an extrovert billionaire ...with terrestrial TV already confirmed with just a matter of time before satellite television but partners get on board to make it a truly global platform for the game.
Keep in mind the timing couldn't be more perfect for Asia rugby with the Japanese rugby world cup due in 2019. Sri Lanka will be a fundamental part of the partnership and will benefit both players and spectators alike ....with all this in place the big pencils at Sri Lanka Rugby HQ need to be hawkeyed and well focused to meet the challenge this is how we progress and carve our pathway in the new rugby Asia.
Sri Lanka needs to stride across the waters and rugby needs to grow in leaps and bounds so that by 2020 Sri Lanka is a force in Asia...
Bula bula Sri!
