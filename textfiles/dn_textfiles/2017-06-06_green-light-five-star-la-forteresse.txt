Green light for five-star La Forteresse

La Forteresse (Private) Limited, a fully-owned subsidiary of Dhammika Perera-controlled Fortress Resorts PLC, will go ahead with its planned five-star property in Mirissa.
An application for the necessary approvals has been filed with Sri Lanka Tourism Development Bureau and the Board of Investment of Sri Lanka (BOI) and the company has already invested Rs. 364 million during FY16/17 towards the acquisition of land for the new hotel project.
The planning work on the property has already been completed in addition to land clearing and geographic investigations, according the Fortress Resorts’ latest annual report.
Additionally, architectural and structural engineering plans have also been completed and necessary applications have also been filed for water and electricity facilities.
Meanwhile approvals from the BOI have already been completed while Tourist Board officials have completed their initial reviews of the proposal as well as on-site reviews. Hence an official expressed confidence that the next phase of development will commence on schedule during the coming financial year.
The new venture will comprise a 66-room luxury resort featuring five-star class facilities and amenities set on a stunning piece of land on the popular Mirissa coastal region.
In recent years in particular, Mirissa has witnessed a remarkable transformation into a bustling new tourist hot-spot and we are extremely confident of the potential that this location will have to create another unique resort featuring the same seamless brand of tropical elegance for which the Fortress Resorts and Spas have become internationally renowned, the report said.
The Fortress Resort will also be closing operations from June 12 to July 25, 2017, as part of its ongoing renovation programme, which will see the complete reconstruction of our existing lobby to feature a timber finish and we will also use this time to modify the interior to add a further 30 rooms.
