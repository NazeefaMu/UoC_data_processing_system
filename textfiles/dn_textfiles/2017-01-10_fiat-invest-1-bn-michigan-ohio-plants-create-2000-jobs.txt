Fiat to invest $1 bn in Michigan, Ohio plants, create 2,000 jobs

FCA, the U.S. arm of automaker Fiat-Chrysler, announced on Sunday that it would invest a total $1 billion in plants in Michigan and Ohio, which will add 2000 new jobs in the United States.
The announcement, in what the company said was the second phase of a plan it first made public a year ago, came days after Ford Motor Company decided to scrap a plan to build a facility in Mexico, instead opting to invest in a plant in Michigan.
Ford’s CEO cited demand, rather than the policies of President-elect Donald Trump, who has vowed to impose a “border tax” on companies that send jobs abroad.
“Consistent and combined with previously announced investments, FCA US is further demonstrating its commitment to strengthening its U.S. manufacturing base, and aligning U.S. capacity to extend the Jeep product lineup,” FCA said. CNBC News
