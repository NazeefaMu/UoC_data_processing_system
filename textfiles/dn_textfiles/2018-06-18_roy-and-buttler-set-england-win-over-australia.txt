Roy and Buttler set up England win over Australia

CARDIFF, Saturday: Jason Roy returned to the scene of one of his greatest disappointments to score a century as England beat Australia by 38 runs to win the second one-day international at Cardiff on Saturday.
Roy's 120 and stand-in captain Jos Buttler's rapid 91 not out took England to a total of 342 for eight as the hosts went 2-0 up in this five-match series.
Australia opener Shaun Marsh made 131 to became the first Glamorgan batsman to score an international century at the Welsh county's Sophia Gardens headquarters.
But their 304 all out meant world champions Australia had suffered a seventh defeat in eight ODIs.
The Yorkshire duo of fast bowler Liam Plunkett (four for 53) and leg-spinner Adil Rashid (three for 70) shared seven wickets as England won with 17 balls to spare.
It was just over a year ago in Cardiff that struggling Surrey opener Roy, 27, was dropped from the England side that suffered an eight-wicket defeat in the semi-finals of the Champions Trophy by Pakistan, the eventual tournament winners.
Roy though regained his place in and on Saturday he scored his fifth hundred in 60 ODIs.
It was also his first since he made an England record 180 against Australia in Melbourne in January. Wicket-keeper Buttler, captaining 2019 World Cup hosts England after regular ODI skipper Eoin Morgan was ruled out with a back spasm shortly before the toss, followed up with a 70-ball knock that included two extravagant ramped sixes off successive deliveries from paceman Jhye Richardson.
The most Australia have ever made batting second to win an ODI is 334 for eight against England at Sydney in 2011.
Ashton Agar (46) offered Marsh excellent support in a sixth-wicket partnership of 96, before he was stumped by Buttler off Rashid.
But an Australia side missing star batsmen Steve Smith and David Warner, both given year-long bans for their roles in the Cape Town ball-tampering fiasco in March, just fell short.
This result meant three of Australia's national teams had all lost on the same day, the Socceroos beaten 2-1 by France at the football World Cup in Russia and the Wallabies going down 26-21 to Ireland in a rugby union Test in Melbourne. – AFP
