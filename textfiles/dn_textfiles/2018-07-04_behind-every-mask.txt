Behind  every mask

Lucien Bulatsinhala’s childhood ended in 1956. He grew up in a coastal village known as Wedikanda in Rathmalana where fishery and Sea sand business was done and it was his childhood kingdom. Amongst his poor coconut leaves sheltered houses stood one Bangalow, where a high ranking officer of the Postal Department, a good Tamil gentleman by the name of Doresunderam lived.
All those around, who didn’t know English including my father finally went to Doresunderam to get a government letter or a telegram read. “We wanted to associate with his son Kumar and the daughter Rani but the class difference did not allow us to do so. But, we got the opportunity to talk with the family at the annual almsgiving held at the Bungalow where almost everyone in the village attended,” Bulatsinhala reminisces.
At that time there was no ethnic or religious division like Tamil, Muslim or Burgher, but there was something called class difference. Sri Dharmaloka College, a Government assisted Buddhist College where Bulatsinhala studied in Rathmalana had in his class, a Tamil boy called Wellaiah and a Muslim girl by the name of Leela. But after 1956 because of the anti-Tamil movement co-existence vanished. Many families including Doresunderam family just disappeared.
“We too had left Rathmalana when ethnic riots broke up in 1958. But, as an adult when I joined the State Clerical service in 1963 I had the opportunity to meet many Good Tamil and Muslim officers. Administrative officer K.C. Nithyanandan is one such person who is still in my memory.”
Velupillai Arumugam helped him at a very decisive era in Bulatsinhala’s life becomes second only to his parents.
“When I joined the Government Clerical Service, I was registered as an external student at the Peradeniya University. My first appointment was to the District Agricultural Extension office at Nuwara Eliya. I pleaded before many Sinhala – Buddhist officers asking for a transfer to Head Office of the Agricultural Department in Peradeniya. I was given a transfer, not to Peradeniya but to Animal Husbandry Farm in Ambewela. Here again, I did not give up my struggle with the transfer. Velupillai Arumugam was the Manager at the Animal Husbandry Farm in Ambewela at that time. He was well aware of the struggle I was making, as all my correspondence requesting a transfer were referred to head office through him.”
Before making his minute Velupillai Arumugam questioned Lucien Bulatsinhala.
“What is the reason they are refusing to give the transfer?”
“They are unable to find someone to replace me here at Ambewela˜
“Is that the problem?”
The officer made the minute in English. Taking into consideration this young officer's university education, transfer this young officer to Peradeniya immediately. If it is difficult to find a replacement to send to Ambewela I will take responsibility to make arrangements to cover his duties.
If he did not do that kind minute on that day, a Lucian Bulathsinhala would not have emerged. That Lucian would not have had the opportunity to associate with one Bandula Jayawardane, Professor Sarachandra, Wimaladharma Diyasena, H.H.Banara, Wasanatha Kunara nor one G.W.Jayantha. “Remove the mask" is my latest drama created in commemoration of all those good Tamil and Muslim people including that great person Velupillai Arumugam.
Bulatsinhala’s play ‘Ves Muhuna Galavanna’ (Remove the Mask) is centred around Colombo after the war.
Antique dealer Gamini Kalawarne’s son Saliya is an entertaining, generous and a good young person. He is in love with Asokamala- a Karaoke singer in a nightclub. But Asokamala refuses his love. Saliya’s best friend is the son of a Minister. He comes forward to help his friend who has been rejected and thereby insulted by this girl. He wants to win her for his friend even by force.
Asokamala and Saliya meet. She reveals to Saliya that she is a Tiger soldier in disguise as a Sinhala girl. Unable to bear the internal conflicts and cruelty within the Tiger Army she tried unsuccessfully to run away to India and is in a very destitute situation at present. Her intention is to migrate to Australia or India and continue her interrupted education. She says.
She further says that she has been brought up with the Sinhalese from her childhood and has been disappointed with the unreasonable treatments from the Sinhalese governments again and again which led her to join the Tiger army. She asks Saliya “Do you think you want to have a love affair with such a girl?”
This musical play unfolds revealing the efforts to resolve this problem. The play will be staged at the Lionel Wendt on July 12 and 13.
