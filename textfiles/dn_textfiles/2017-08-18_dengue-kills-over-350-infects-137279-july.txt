Dengue kills over 350, infects 137,279 up to July

Dengue killed over 350 people and infected 137,279 countrywide during the past seven months, the epidemiology unit sources said. A special dengue eradication programme would be carried out on August 24 and 25 in the Northern and Eastern Provinces since the country could experience an increase in dengue deaths in the North and East due to the onset of monsoon rains, the sources said.
Another island-wide dengue eradication programme would come to effect from September 20 to 26. The majority of dengue patients were from the Colombo, Gampaha, Kalutara, Kurunegala, Puttalam, Galle and Matara districts, the sources said.
