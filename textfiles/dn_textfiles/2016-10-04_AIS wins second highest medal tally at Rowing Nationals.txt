AIS wins second highest medal tally at Rowing Nationals

Asian International School (AIS) performed exceptionally well to gain second place at the 31st National Rowing Championship, in the Under 18 category organized by the Amateur Rowing Association of Sri Lanka (ARASL) that took place from 15th to 17th September at the Diyawanna Rowing Centre (DRC) in Battaramulla.
AIS won the Gold in the Boys Under 18 Pair event with a record time of 7mins 12secs with Champaka Edirimanne and Kiaan Ahamed rowing brilliantly and over powering strong competition from Royal College and St Thomas College. AIS also won a Silver in the Under 18 Single Sculls event with a superb performance by Champaka Edirimanne whilst Khizer Ahamed and Nadun Hettiarachchi won Bronze in the Under 18 Double Sculls event. AIS was the only international school that achieved this high standard required to win at this national event where the international standard of 2000 meter rowing is a test on the endurance, both physically and mentally of oarsmen and oarswomen.
The AIS rowing crew now comprises around fourteen young oarsmen and oarswomen who have made great strides and performed extremely well at both national and international regattas.
AIS has a history of 27 years and is amongst the top three international schools in Colombo with the highest number of students gaining all A’s at Edexcel Examinations. Sport is given an important place in the School’s curriculum. The school encourages Swimming, Basketball, Netball, Tennis and Rowing.
Asian Alliance Insurance is a proud sponsor of the Asian International School (AIS) Rowing crew for the rowing seasons of 2016 and 2017, with the objective of promoting this sport where AIS regularly competes and fares prominently amongst the best schools in the country at national level.
