Two arrested for betting on Australia-Sri Lanka T20 match

Warasiya police nabbed two persons accepting bets on the Australia-Sri Lanka T20 match late on Saturday afternoon. An offence was registered against them on the same night.
Acting on a tip off, the police had raided the residence of one Prakash Savlani in the Sant Kanvar Colony in the Warasiya area of the city. It came to light that Savlani was accepting bets there along with one Pankaj Kavlani, a resident of Amar Duplex on the New VIP Road. Two laptops, five cellular phones and cash amounting to Rs. 900 was recovered from the accused. The duo used to accept bets over the phones and post them on the laptops.
When the police raided Savlani’s residence, the duo were watching the match live on a television and speaking over the phone to accept bets.
Sources said the bets were being recorded on the laptop in code words.
