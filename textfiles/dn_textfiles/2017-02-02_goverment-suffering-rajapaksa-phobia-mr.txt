Goverment suffering from Rajapaksa phobia: MR

The government is suffering from Rajapaksa phobia. Instead of beating the Rajapaksa name, it is high time for it to buckle down to some serious work for the benefit of this country, Kurunegala district parliamentarian and former President Mahinda Rajapksa said.
He was speaking to the media after he made a pilgrimage to Anuradhapura where he worshiped the Jaya Sri Maha Bodhi, Ruwanweliseya and several other places of worship and received blessings. Rajapaksa said the government was trying to resolve issues and problems by beating university students and taking them to court.
Problems could not be solved by sending them to remand prison on framed up charges. The government should have resolved the SAITM problem through discussion without remanding the students' Action Committee leader that carried out the protest. He said the SAITM was started during his rule. It was first started without their knowledge, and they were made aware of it after it became functioning.
