Saints Quadrangular Athletic Meet will be a keen contest

With the revival of the saints Quadrangular Athletic meet in 2015, much interest has been created in improving the standard of Athletics in the four School- St. Anthony's College, Kandy, St. Benedict's College, St. Joseph's College and St. Peter's College. The 2017 meet at St. Peter's Grounds on 25th and 26th February brings together some of most outstanding schools boy athletes of the present time and also some of younger and older past athletes. However, it would be interested to go back in history and recall some of the stars of yesteryear, who were school boy's heroes at their time.
Of the four schools St. Joseph's College probably has the best record, being a force in the schools’ athletic scene from 1930s to at least 1960s. Names that came to mind are Norman Mathews, a Champion Miller, A.C Dep and Lucian Dep, Pole Vaulters , in the early ears. In the 1950s and 1960s, Joes were particularly strong with outstanding athletes like Nagalingam Edirisingham, who came from Jaffna becoming the Asian Games High Jump Champion, Long Jumpers like P. Don Victor and Adolf Silva. Adolf was also a fine sprinter and his battles with Darrel Lieverz (Royal College) in Public Schools 200 Meters races are still remembered by the athletes of that era. Later sprinters like Twins Srian and Janaka Perera, Joseph Soysa , Shanthilal Fernando and Neomal Basnayake brought many victories to the Josephians.
The Peterites boasted of some excellent throwers, Ranjith Weerasena, first won the National discuss title as a Schoolboy in 1959 and successfully defended the title for ten consecutive years. During these years Peterites dominated the John Tarbat Schools Athletic Championship. Anton Perera - Public Schools Champion in the Discus, Putt Shot and Javelin events, Royden De Silva, who was probably more renowned as ruggerite and a basketballer. There were also fine runners like Godfrey Goonetilleke and his brother Andrew. The Peterites Golden Era, was probably in the late 1980s going into 1990s with brilliant athletes like Shane De Silva, Nielhaan Samaranayake,- Public schools and National schools champion Athletes. Dinesh Perera who represented the South Asian Games in 4x400 meters relay team and 110 Meters Hurdle Champion Mahesh Perera who was a member of the 1996 Atlantic Olympic Team. Preterites had an unbeatable sprint relay team - Failan Saleem, Roshan Abeygoonawardena, Shane De Silva and Dinesh Perera were the members of the team.
The Kandy Antonians too have a rich history in athletics. In the 1950s, there were some excellent feats at Public schools Meets by Ivan Boteju (220 yards), Jeeva Weerasinghe (440yards) sprinter R.L. Perera and Javelin Thrower Ranjith Samarasekera remained a diehard Antonian right until his demise just last month. Later sprinters Pradeep Waidyaratne , Thusitha Dharmaratne , J.N.L. Jayakody, Maithree Nanayakkara and Mangala Waidyratne, long distance runner S.R.Karunatilleke and Thrower Jackie Robertson brought glory to the school. In more recent times Outstanding Antonian athletes including Ruwan Kalpage (Better known as a Sri Lankan Cricketer), Thrower L.V Ekanayake and Marlon Von Hoght.
The Benedictines really came into the fore in the new Millennium. However there were some excellent individual performers earlier. Hugh De Siva and Jayantha Senevirathne were Public Schools Pole Vault Champions. Godson Perera and and Gordon Dissanyake won 100 yards dash, Jayakumar Perera and Harold Sirisena were Public Schools Javalin Champions. Nihal Soysa won High Jump at Junior Nationals, Ireneus Ferdinandez and Shelton Pietersz were Junior National Champions in 400 Meters. Godfrey Fernando exceled in long jump in 1970s. Prasad Perera won the 800 Meters at the Athletic Nationals. The turn of the Millennium saw the Bens gradually becoming a force to be reckoned with and won their very first major Athletic Trophy, winning the All Island Schools Athletic Championship in 2007 under Raveen Fernando. Currently Benedictines are probably the No :1 in Schools Athletics in Sri Lanka and hold several All Island Schools, Senior Tarbat, Junior Tarbat , Junior Nationals and All Island Relay records.
The meet on the last weekend of February 2017 should be exciting and keenly contested in a spirit of healthy rivalry and good sportsmanship. To add glamour, there will be invitation Relays for Girls and Boys, with leading schools taking part.
