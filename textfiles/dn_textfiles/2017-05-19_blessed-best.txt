Blessed with the best!

Ladies’ College is the “undisputed queen,” when it comes to drama. From producing some extra ordinary musicals to winning Best Stage Craft with mere cardboards, the girls have always left the audience spellbound with their noteworthy concepts. Drama is a tradition at the college and the girls are introduced to Drama from a very young age. The dramas and musicals produced are usually staged under the English Literary Society.
“We believe in giving a chance to every single girl. When you have a separate club for Drama, only the pupils who are a part of it get the opportunity to take part in productions and competitions. Here at Ladies’ college we make it a point to introduce a fresh set of girls every time we produce a Drama .We don’t repeat the same set of girls. We give an opportunity to everyone because every girl is blessed with a unique talent. ,” said teacher in charge Shani Almeida.
Ladies’ College is blessed with the best talent.
A high standard
“Drama is all about talent and we are blessed with the best. We’ve had some wonderful actors in the past as well as in the present. It’s been only a couple of years since I took over Drama.
When I came in I was left with a handful of raw talent , together we molded the raw talent into master pieces and went on stage for the Shakespeare Drama competition in 2015.
Not only did we win, but we also bagged the Best Stage Craft award and ShaliniCorea won the Best Actress Award. It truly was a triumphant moment for the school as we took part in the competition after five long years.” stated Almeida.
Almeida stressed that the girls’ parents are extremely supportive.
“The parents are very supportive. The girls’ stay until late to practice, some even take part while sitting for their Ordinary level or Advanced level examinations. However the parents are very understanding and mindful. If we are at a high standard today it is only because of the tremendous effort the girls have put in. They pour in their heart and soul. For example we had our girls acting as tables and chairs with cardboards attached to them for the 2015 Shakespeare Dram Comp.
It is not an easy task to balance someone’s weight or to pretend to be a property. Both the cast and crew practiced it over and over again to make it perfect as we can’t afford to make any mistakes on stage.
The girls along with the choreographer, Jhannieque De Silva worked so hard and thankfully nothing went wrong on Stage during all three rounds and a special thanks must go to Adamaly the Director. It was entirely his idea,” pointed out Almeida.
The crowning glory
If winning the all Island Shakespeare Drama competition is the crowning glory for schools, then Ladies College is the queen of all queens as they’ve won the competition ten times! They have emerged as runners up twice and have had seven of their actresses winning the Best Actress Award till date.
Winning or losing doesn’t matter, because ultimately it is what you take out of the competition and how that molds your character.
“Winning or losing doesn’t really matter. What matters the most is what the child learns from the whole experience. After taking control, the girls persuaded me to let them take part in the Interact Dram comp. Initially I was uncertain, but in the end I was glad that I let them take part, as I saw a girl grow from a silent individual into a confident and strong girl.
A student feels free and uninhibited on stage and could discover her strengths while acting. That’s why I feel drama is an important aspect of school life. You also get to experience a character and story through drama,” elucidated Almeida.
Almeida emphasized on the fact that she wants the very best for her young thespians.
“As the Teacher in Charge, the challenges I would face is that I want all my students to be able to have the opportunity to take part in drama competitions. And when some are not able to, I feel disheartened for them.
I also feel that picking a script and finding the best Director who blends in with the school is a tough challenge that I have to face. I also want to ensure that whatever we do, we do it for the love of drama and acting and bringing honor to the school is of utmost priority for me,” said Almeida.
The art of multi-tasking
Drama helped Dulinika Bullumulla to learn the art of multi-tasking and juggling different tasks efficiently.
“I‘ve been acting from a very young age and the most important lesson I learned from drama is the art of multi-tasking. I never neglect my studies because of drama and vice versa.
It so hard to juggle, but as you grow you learn to find room to fit everything in. It’ll be my debut performance at Shakespeare this year and I’m looking forward to it,” said Bullumulla.
Understanding the characters
Thisaakhya Jayakody feels that drama more than anything else helps you to discover the true ‘you’.
“We are introduced to drama at a young age. We are seen on stage more often than in classrooms! We were able to lose our stage fright at a very early stage and now we portray an array of characters.
I’ve never been a woman on stage, I’ve always been a man. I feel in drama, you discover the true ‘you’ but the best part is, along the way you get to know your peers well. You learn to be tolerant and be comfortable with each other and that’s very important because at the end of the day you share your space on stage with them.
When it comes to understanding the characters and the script, we do quite a lot of homework. For Lavinia we went and visited the Mount Lavinia Hotel to get a clear picture of the colonial period .For inter-house, we write the script ourselves. We know the character in and out. If it’s a production, our teachers help us out and they usually have a vast knowledge on the subject,” said Jayakody .
A lot more to learn
Kesara Gunawardene called Drama a Serendipity.
“Drama is a serendipity to me. I came in as an ensemble and I ended up winning Best Supporting Actress last year at the Interact Drama Comp. I’m still young and I have a lot more to learn and experience, I’m enthusiastic and I feel that every role I’ve played is memorable,” said Gunawardene.
 
 
The real star
Shalini Corea believes in gathering memories more than trophies.
“The weird thing is, when someone asks me, ‘what’s your most unforgettable drama experience?’, the first thing that comes to my mind are the fun times we had at practice and not the winning moments .
I remember every practice session so vividly in my mind. From sharing food to sharing the stage, every memory remains fresh in my mind.
The best thing about drama is you become the person you portray. The traits of a character will never leave you, it stays with you forever. Once I played a sophisticated English lady and a male director taught me to walk in high heels and act like a lady. The Director takes you through various dimensions and angles of the character and it helps you understand the character better.
For Shakespeare, Adamaly and RuwindiWakwella, helped us with developing all the character traits paying attention to every minute detail.
But the real star of the show has to be Ms. Shani, because she makes our lives easier by having everything under control.
I wouldn’t say that we’ve ventured into every genre. There is still so much to explore and learn. In drama you learn something new every day,” said Corea.
Building a good bond
Nimaya Harris firmly believes in team work.
“In Drama it’s hard for me to pick one incident or experience as most memorable .Every step I took in drama is unforgettable. What I like about drama is that you move around with people whom you wouldn’t otherwise. You have the chance to develop something deeper than a friendship with your seniors and juniors.
When you enact a relationship on stage you gain a better understanding of the thespian you enact that relationship with. You might be impeccable when it comes to your role but that alone won’t help. Building a good bond with your fellow actress through understanding is what’s important.
What I like about Ladies’ College is that everyone gets a chance. Every girl gets the liberty to explore the world of drama,” said Harris.
An unspoken chemistry
Akasha Jirasinghe felt that the family element is what she cherishes.
“In Drama we are a family, one family unbroken. We are all united and this reflects on stage. What we have is an unspoken chemistry with each other, which helps us onstage.
‘The three wise men’ is close to my heart, as I broke out of my shell to portray the role,” said Jirasinghe .
