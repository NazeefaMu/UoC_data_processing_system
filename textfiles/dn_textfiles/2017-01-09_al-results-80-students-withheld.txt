AL results of 80 students withheld

The Advanced Level Examination results of 80 students have been temporarily withheld, Commissioner General of Examinations W.M.N.J. Pushpakumara said.
He said the results of students who sat for the exam fraudulently from districts other than their own have been withheld following preliminary investigations by the Education Ministry.
These students whose results have been withheld had sat for the Examination from the Central, North Western and North Central Provinces, Pushpakumara said.He told the Daily News that this was the first time results have been withheld for cheating by sitting for the exam from another district.
“We will decide what final action is to be taken after a full inquiry. Till then their results have been withheld,” he said.
Education Minister Akila Viraj Kariyawasam revealed in August that 216 students had fraudulently sat for the A-L exam last year from 11 schools in the Nuwara Eliya, Anuradhapura and Puttalam districts.
Out of them 145 students had sat the exam from six schools in Nuwara Eliya, 61 from three schools in Anuradhapura and 10 from two schools in Puttalam. The Commissioner General of Examinations however said the Education Ministry during the preliminary inquiries had decided to release the results of some of the students who provided valid reasons for the change in district.
The misuse of quota for the underprivileged districts, which came to light recently, had been an exam mal-practice that had been continuing for some years.
