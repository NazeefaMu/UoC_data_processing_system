Cabinet to appoint Sub-Committee

Cabinet yesterday decided to appoint a sub-committee to look into the preparation of a draft bill on the Media Regulatory Commission within the next two months.
The Cabinet Sub-Committee is to consist of Ministers Mangala Samaraweera (Chairman), Dr. Sarath Amunugama, Dr.Rajitha Senaratne and Gayantha Karunathilake.
Deputy Minister of Mass Media Karunaratne Paranawithana has been appointed as the convenor of the committee.
A draft on the Code of Ethics for media was approved by Cabinet in November of last year and the Ministry of Mass Media since then has opened up the draft for public consultations.
A source within the Cabinet Sub-Committee speaking to the Daily News explained that there have been many suggestions, comments, recommendations and criticism towards the draft (Code of Ethics for media) and on the government policy to establish an Independent Media Regulatory Commission,
“To solve all these problems, we have been asked to have a healthy dialogue with the media and report back to Cabinet on what action needs to be taken,”the source said.
