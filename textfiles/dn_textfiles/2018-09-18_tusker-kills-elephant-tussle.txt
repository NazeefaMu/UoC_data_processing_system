Tusker kills elephant in tussle

A tusker and an elephant had got into a head to head clash at the Kalawewa National Park resulting in the death of the elephant. Wildlife officials said that the elephant died of wounds caused by the tusker.
Over 50 elephants including calves had gathered around the body of the elephant in groups and inspected the body. They touched the body with their trunks. Wildlife officials said that there are over 300 elephants living in the Kalawewa National Park and showed signs of grief over the loss of the dead elephant.
However, the tusker who left the scene after the elephant fell down and died reappeared at the scene and attacked the carcass. Wildlife officials chased the tusker.
