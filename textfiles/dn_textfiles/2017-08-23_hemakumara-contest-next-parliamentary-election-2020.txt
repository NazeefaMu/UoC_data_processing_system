Hemakumara to contest next Parliamentary Election in 2020

Southern Province Governor Hemakumara Nanayakkara said he has decided to contest the next Parliamentary General Election as a candidate in 2020.
He announced this decision when he attended a ceremony held at the Weeraketiya Divisional Secretariat to distribute dry rations among farmers who had suffered crop damage due to the long spell of drought.
When a journalist inquired about the district from which he hoped to contest, Nanayakkara said he would never come forward from Galle, Matara or Hambantota districts in the Southern Province.
