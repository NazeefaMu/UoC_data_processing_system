Digital voucher system for National Nutrition Programme

The Government will introduce a novel method to facilitate the National Nutrition Programme for pregnant mothers
The existing system will be replaced with a mobile-based digital voucher system, with the cooporation of mobile telephone companies.
A pregnant mother receives a voucher for Rs. 2,000 each month during her pregnancy. The vouchers are issued by the Divisional Secretariats for the mothers to buy their needs from the merchants recommended by the authorities. The beneficiaries have to go to the Divisional Secretaries’ office to collect their vouchers.
Under the new system, a mother will receive a digital voucher to her mobile each month.
The Central Programme Management Unit of the Prime Minister’s Office initiated the concept. The project will be implemented together with the Telecommunication and Digital Infrastructure Ministry and the Women and Child Affairs Ministry.
