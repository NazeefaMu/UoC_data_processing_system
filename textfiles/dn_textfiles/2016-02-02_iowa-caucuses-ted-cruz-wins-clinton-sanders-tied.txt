Iowa caucuses: Ted Cruz wins; Clinton, Sanders tied

Texas Sen. Ted Cruz has won the Iowa Republican caucuses, a huge victory for him and a bitter defeat for Donald Trump in the country's first presidential contest.
 
Democrats, meanwhile, are in a nail-biter fight with Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders less than a percentage point apart.
 
The victory for Cruz is the first time that the conventional laws of politics have applied to Trump, a billionaire businessman who has built his campaign around the perception that he's a winner who can bring his unique skills to the White House.
 
But Trump's big personality, social media presence and large rallies failed to overcome Cruz's more traditional approach to Iowa's retail politics. Cruz spent months touring the state and reaching out to evangelical voters. The win sets him up as a formidable contender in the delegate-rich, Southern states that crowd the GOP calendar in the coming weeks and offers movement conservatives hope that one of their own can become the nominee for the first time since Ronald Reagan.
 
As he claimed victory, Cruz fired immediate shots at both Trump and the party elites who disdain him.
 
"Iowa has sent notice that the Republican nominee and the next President of the United States will not be chosen by the media, will not be chosen by the Washington establishment," Cruz said.
 
With about 99% of the GOP vote in, Cruz was ahead of Trump 28% to 24%. Marco Rubio was at 23%.
 
Trump delivered a short but gracious speech, saying he loved Iowa and vowed to go on next week to win the New Hampshire primary.
 
"We will go on to get the Republican nomination and we will go on to easily beat Hillary or Bernie," Trump told supporters. "We finished second, and I have to say I am just honored."
 
Rubio's strong showing could set him up as the best placed potential establishment candidate to take on "outsider" challengers Cruz and Trump.
 
"This is the moment they said would never happen. For months, they told us we had no chance," a jubilant Rubio said, as he became the first candidate to appear before the cameras to comment on the results.
 
"They told me that I needed to wait my turn, that I needed to wait in line. But tonight here in Iowa, the people of this great state have sent a very clear message — after seven years of Barack Obama, we are not waiting any longer to take our country back."
 
Cruz's win, meanwhile, suggests that the Texas senator's organization, built up over months, could prevail over Trump's more unorthodox campaign based on the power of his personality and celebrity.
 
Trump went into Monday night with polls suggesting that he stood on the verge of a potentially stunning victory that would shake that Republican Party establishment. But Cruz banked on a strong turnout from evangelical voters to build a classic Iowa winning coalition.
 
The caucuses resulted in two casualties -- one on each side. Former Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley, a Democrat, and former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee, a Republican, both dropped their candidacies after faring poorly.
 
Even before the caucuses began, Ben Carson's campaign said he wouldn't go directly to New Hampshire or South Carolina -- the site of the next primary contests. Instead, the retired neurosurgeon, who was briefly the Iowa front-runner last fall, will go to Florida to rest and see family.
 
Former Pennsylvania Sen. Rick Santorum is also skipping New Hampshire but will go straight to South Carolina, which holds its Republican presidential primary on February 20.
 
Democrats
On the Democratic side, Clinton is holding the narrowest of leads over insurgent candidate Bernie Sanders. She was ahead 50.1% to 49.4% with 95% of the votes counted.
 
"It's rare that we have the opportunity we do now," she said in a speech that didn't explicitly claim victory. "To have a real contest of ideas. To really think hard about what the Democratic party stands for and what we want the future of our country to look like."
 
She added that she was "excited" about debating Sanders and was breathing a "big sigh of relief" after the caucuses.
 
Sanders told a raucous crowd chanting "Bernie, Bernie" that his campaign had made stunning progress in a short period of time.
 
"Nine months ago, we came to this beautiful state, we had no political organization, we had no money, we had no name recognition and we were taking on the most powerful political organization in the United States of America."
 
"And tonight," he said, "while the results are still not known, it looks like we are in a virtual tie." (CNN)
