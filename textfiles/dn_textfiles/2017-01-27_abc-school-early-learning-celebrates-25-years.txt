ABC School of Early Learning celebrates 25 years

ABC School of Early Learning is celebrating 25 years in pre-school education.
The shared passion and vision of Adhirupini Tyagarajah and Ayoma Fernando brought about the birth of ABC School of Early Learning in January 1992.
Adhirupini said: “My fascination for children and the desire to be with them and share my enthusiasm and creativity drove me to start this establishment with Ayoma”.
“When my daughter was enrolled at a preschool in Colombo and stopped going after two weeks it got me thinking.... Hence together with my friend Adhirupini the idea to start up a preschool and establish ABC School of Early Learning was mooted,” said Anoma.
Surangie Munaweera joined the ABC School in 1994 and thereafter was invited to the Board and was appointed the principal of the school. “From my childhood, I always played the mother role to my siblings and cousins. Where ever I went, kids would respond to me as if they've known me. I then realized I needed to pursue a career in teaching”.
In its 25 year history, the ABC School has achieved much as well as facilitated many new initiatives.
The school has nurtured over 3500 children through their formative education. Today most of the children have excelled not only in the field of academics but also in sports, art and music.
The ABC School opened their first branch, the ABC Preschool on September 6, 2006.
