NCPA nabs five for sexual abuse of girl

The National Child Protection Authority (NCPA) Special Police Investigations Unit, yesterday, arrested five persons for sexually abusing a 13-year-old girl.
They have also arrested her mother and grandmother who had given permission for the abuse. Out of those arrested, two were found to be relatives of the victim. The suspects were produced before the Wellawaya Magistrate’s Court. Thanamalwila Police had initially received a complaint regarding the child. Thereafter, on the directive of Wellawaya Magistrate Kesara Samaradiwakara, the NCPA had undertaken further investigations.
NCPA investigations into the case are now complete and they had been sent to the Attorney General’s department for the case to be filed in court. The present case before the Magistrate’s Court is to be called on March 22. NCPA Director, attorney-at-law, Marini de Livera, in a statement to the media, said the investigation was carried out under her directive by the NCPA Special Police Investigations Unit, OIC, Police Inspector Priyankara, Sub Inspector Somasiri and their team.
De Livera noted that children can be abused at any place in society and that society as a whole needs to be vigilant to prevent such abuse.
Further, to avoid such situations, children need to be made aware of what ‘good touch’ and ‘bad touch’ are so that they too can alert those responsible when faced with such situations.
For example, patting a child on the head is ‘good touch’ (eg: parents blessing a child) whilst touching a child near his/her genitals, unless for medical purposes is considered an offence.
The NCPA also asks that adults take precautions and keep an eye on any unsafe spaces children might wander and teach them to voice out their opposition to any wrongdoing that they may face. The authority also asks parents to teach their children to inform a trusted adult when any abuse or mistreatment occurs. The public can report abuse to the nearest police station or the NCPA hotline 1929.
