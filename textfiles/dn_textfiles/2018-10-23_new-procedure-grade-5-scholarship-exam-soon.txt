New procedure for Grade 5 Scholarship exam soon

The procedure followed in conducting the Grade 5 Scholarship Examination will be changed soon, Education Minister Akila Viraj Kariyawasam said.
He was speaking at the opening of a new primary education resource centre at Udawela Revatha Madya Maha Vidyalaya under the ‘Nearest school is the best school’ programme recently.
He said while the scholarship examination would be used for granting scholarships, steps would be taken to conduct the admission test only again.
This would help eliminate competition. A committee to look into the matter would be appointed soon.
The Minister said that he would also submit a Cabinet Memorandum to prohibit the conducting of private tuition classes during school hours.
