Hajj pilgrims to receive special communication facility

In terms of a MoU entered into between the Gulf Holding Business Services EST and the Consulate General of Sri Lanka in Jeddah, arrangements are being made to collaborate on providing 3000 SIM cards to enable Sri Lankan Hajj pilgrims to communicate with their fellow pilgrims free of charge and to contact their families in Sri Lanka at a concessionary rate of 99 Halala per minute. In addition, the pilgrims are also given a 500 MB free data facility.
The Saudi Telecom Company has agreed to charge a nominal fee of SR 11.50 for a SIM card and a compulsory initial credit of SR 20.00. The SIM cards are scheduled to be distributed in Colombo among pilgrims through Hajj travel operators.
