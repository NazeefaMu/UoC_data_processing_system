Institutions under Labour Department to be increased

The number of institutions under Labour Department inspection will be increased from 75,000 to 90,000 this year and arrangements in this regard have now been finalized, Labour and Trade Union Relations Ministry Secretary Nimal Saranatissa said.
He said the system of inspections will be accelerated to ensure that quick legal action is taken against errant institutions denying employee rights and privileges.
He said earlier, inspections were delayed due to a shortage of labour officers. An additional batch of nearly 200 labour officers has now been recruited and trained to be deployed for duty from March 26.
He said the new recruits would be assigned to districts which experience a shortage and they would inspect institutions denying EPF and ETF rights to their employees under a special plan devised by the ministry.
