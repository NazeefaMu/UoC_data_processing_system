Ceylinco VIP On The Spot to offer Rs. 1 mn medical cover

Ceylinco General Insurance has announced yet another breakthrough in Motor Insurance, a Rs. 1 mn cover that will reimburse medical costs incurred in the treatment of heart disease, cancer, kidney failure, stroke and several other serious illnesses including heart attack and open heart surgery, major organ transplants, chronic lung and liver diseases, deafness, blindness, multiple sclerosis, paralysis etc.
Introduced as an exclusive benefit for Ceylinco VIP On The Spot policy holders, the new cover will be valid for new policies, while existing policyholders will be entitled to this new benefit from the date of their next renewal.
“As a company with an ear to changing customer needs, Ceylinco General Insurance does not rest on its laurels, but is constantly looking ahead to break new ground in its commitment to exceed customer expectations. In today’s complex world, it is all about delivering a level of service that delights customers,” said Ajith Gunawardena, Chief Executive Officer of Ceylinco General Insurance.
“This is the first time we are introducing such an exclusive insurance cover for our customers. Ceylinco General Insurance has created a unique and unparalleled product that extends never-before-offered benefits to customers and keeps adding further value to it with revolutionary new benefits. Ceylinco General Insurance believes that ultimately customers will decide on the efficacy of the benefits,” he said.
“Considering ever-increasing medical costs, this benefit will undoubtedly ease the financial burden on our customers to a great extent.
With Ceylinco VIP enjoying a major share of the vehicle insurance market, most Sri Lankan vehicle users will be entitled to this benefit, in addition to a host of other benefits they already enjoy, such as, if a brand new or an unregistered vehicle is condemned within two years of purchase, the company replaces it with a vehicle of similar make and model irrespective of the price escalation; a Rs.4 million Emergency Hospitalisation Insurance Cover; a similar replacement vehicle in the event the accident repair exceeds four days; emergency roadside assistance; personal accident cover of up to Rs. 200,000/- for each passenger; the insured value of the vehicle increasing by 10% every year; a 10-year warranty for your vehicle against manufacturers defects, valid for the first 10 years from the year of manufacture; payment of lease installments of up to two months in the event of a repair exceeding 30 days etc.,” said Patrick Alwis, the Managing Director of Ceylinco General Insurance.
Dr. Jagath Alwis, Director, Technical, said, “Health insurance is a dire need for the people of this country as private medical facilities are becoming beyond the reach of the masses. Providing an insurance cover of this nature will enable our customers to obtain advanced medical facilities if the need arises, without being a burden on their loved ones.”
In the case of individual customers, the insured will be entitled to this revolutionary benefit, while corporate customers or fleet owners must name an individual (user or driver) as beneficiary.
For individual customers with more than one vehicle, the spouse or immediate family members could be named as beneficiaries. Similarly, comprehensive motorcycle and Three Wheeler policyholders will be entitled to a cover of Rs.100,000/- and third party customers too will benefit with a cover of Rs.100,000/-. DJ
