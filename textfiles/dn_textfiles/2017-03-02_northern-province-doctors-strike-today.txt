Northern province doctors to strike today

 Doctors attached to state hospitals in the <U+200B>Northern Province will launch a strike today <U+200B>from 8.00 am to 12.00 noon to protest against the SAITM `medical faculty', Government Medical Officers' Association (GMOA) Secretary Dr. Navin de Zoysa said in a statement.
According to Dr. Zoysa, the strike will be extended if the doctors of the branches of the GMOA decide to do so. This is the <U+200B>seventh<U+200B> phase of the series of strikes launched by the GMOA in all nine provinces.
Dr. Zoysa said several protests in the forms of rallies, conferences and hand-out distribution will take place on the same day with the participation of all anti SAITM movements. No step has been taken by the authorities to solve the SAITM issue and prevent people from undergoing various difficulties.
Dr. Zoysa said the GMOA is doing this to safeguard people's lives and not for the benefit of doctors.
