Shift’s Sahil and Kaushalya to compete at Cannes creative fest

Two employees of integrated brand agency Shift have been selected as the winners in the Film category of the Young Lions local competition and will head to France where they will take part in the prestigious Cannes Lions International Festival of Creativity from June 17 to 24.
A team of 13 young marketing communications professionals will represent the county at the festival.
A local competition to select the winners was recently organised by Metal Factor in collaboration with the International Advertising Association (IAA), the Association of Accredited Advertising Agencies (4As) and the Sri Lanka Institute of Marketing (SLIM).
Creative Group Head Kaushalya Kathireson and Art Director Sahil Gunasekere were placed first in the Film category by an eminent jury after a strict scrutiny.
“We as an agency believe marketing in the Age of Now is not only about sharp strategy and great creative but also about engaging the right audience at the right time with the right message. Understanding this dynamic is what frames our ‘Future Forward’ thinking,” said CEO Sujeewa Samarasekera.
This is the second time Shift has marked a milestone with the win this year.
Last year’s local competition saw Sameera Ratnayake, Senior Interactive Designer and Ryan Rebeira, Manager Social Media winning in the Cyber category.
Shift has some of the youngest and brightest team of thinkers who work on a diverse portfolio of brands to deliver memorable and effective work across the marketing mix.
“We believe in building brands keeping people, product and purpose at the core of our planning process leading to work that works for our client brands. We encourage a strong learning culture within the agency to keep our key asset, our people, focused and inspired. I’m delighted to see two of our young team members winning this great opportunity to bring something back to the company and the industry” said Managing Director Chrishani Kotalawela.
Shift is owned and managed by these two veterans from the marketing communications industry ably supported by a young and energetic team to serve a multitude of brands across categories within Sri Lanka and beyond.
In addition to total creative services across platforms, Shift serves its clients with strategic media planning and buying solutions as well as event planning, making it a fully integrated agency.
Kaushalya Kathireson who currently serves as Creative Group Head at Shift has managed many multinational brands and is known for her meticulous attention to detail, her passion for creative writing and her ways of integrating the latest in technology to the simplest of campaigns.
Art director Sahil Gunasekere is the only Sri Lankan advertising professional to have won four coveted awards in the local industry competitions to compete in the international arena.
