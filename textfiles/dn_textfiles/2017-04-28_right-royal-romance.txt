The Right Royal Romance

It was six years ago, on a day like tomorrow (April 29) that a new dawn was ushered in for Britain's royal family. The event was an impeccably choreographed occasion of high pomp and heartfelt emotion, of ancient customs mingling with modern developments.
Viewing estimates for the ceremony, at 11 am. British time on the dot, hovered in the three billion range, give or take 500 million on the day Prince William married his College sweetheart Catherine Middleton (She has parents who made their own fortune with an Internet party-accouterments business and even a generation ago, would have been considered unthinkable as a prospective royal bride.) The whole world, however, approved of the union, and celebrated in various ways; Australians held bouquet-throwing competitions; people in Hong Kong wore Kate and William masks; New Yorkers rose by dawn to watch the entrance of guests like Victoria Beckham, teetering pregnantly in sky-high Christian Louboutin heels. Rowan Atkinsonand his wife as well as Princess Diana's brother, Charles Spencer and Prime Minister David Cameron who remembered camping out on the streets to celebrate Prince Charles and Diana Spencer's wedding in 1981, were also present.
Thirty years after that other fairytale wedding, the Metropolitan Police said, a million people lined the route of the royal procession, and half a million gathered in front of Buckingham Palace to watch the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, kiss (twice) on the palace balcony.
On her wedding day Kate Middleton wore a gorgeous, custom Alexander McQueen gown designed by Sarah Burton. Her “something old” was the design of the dress, using traditional craftsmanship. “Something new” was represented by her earrings, a gift from her parents. The tiara was borrowed, (previously worn by Queen Mary, the Queen Mother, the Queen and the Princess Royal) and she had a blue ribbon sewn into her dress for her blue item. Kate's bouquet was a picturesque arrangement of lily-of-the-valleys, sweet William, hyacinth, ivy and myrtle.
Prince William wore the bright scarlet coat of an Irish Guards mounted officer, the uniform of his senior honorary army appointment. He was also wearing “gold sword slings,” but no sword.
According to reports in the New York Times, The outfits of the guests were generally tasteful and royal-friendly on the day of the wedding. The Queen, wore a yellow Angela Kelly-designed single crepe wool primrose dress. A few things stuck out. The exotic costumes of foreign dignitaries, seeming throwbacks to imperial times. The hats worn by the ladies, which resembled, variously, overturned buckets, flowerpots, lampshades, fezzes, salad plates, tea cozies, flying saucers, abstract artworks or, in one case, a pile of feathers.
When Kate arrived next to him on the aisle, Prince William was seen remarking: “You look beautiful"and joking to his father-in-law: "Just a small family affair!" ( there were 1,900 guests present as well as the eyes of the whole world.)During the service conducted by the Archbishop of Canterbury, Prince William said "I will" clearly and firmly, while his bride spoke more quietly, apparently slightly overcome with emotion.
Kate's sister, Pippa was chosen as the Maid of Honor and also wore a Sarah Burton dress. The bridesmaids included: Lady Louis of Windsor, Margarita Armstrong-Jones, Grace van Cutsem and Eliza Lopes. Prince Harry was the Best Man, and William Lowther-Pinkerton as well as Tom Pettifer were page boys.
The wedding ceremony passed without hitch, with the only moment of tension provided as Prince William struggled to put the ring, fashioned from Welsh gold given to him by the Queen, on his bride's finger.
Afterward, the bride and groom cut the eight-tiered wedding cake crafted by pastry chef Fiona Cairns at a private reception in Buckingham Palace's picture gallery. The cake boasted raisins, walnuts, cherries, lemon, grated orange, and French brandy. The lace-reminiscent decorations were inspired by a piece of Kate's wedding gown.
During their vows, Kate and William promised to "love, comfort, honor and keep" each other with a single exception - Kate, did not promise to obey her husband. Observers noted, she seemed already at ease in what will now be a lifetime job, one with a heavy burden of responsibility as well as great privilege. As the couple drove in their horse-drawn carriage from the church to Buckingham Palace, she waved like a pro — from the wrist, the royal way.
Reflecting on his and Kate's wedding day, Prince William confessed to ABC host Katie Couric that he wished his mother Princess Diana had been able to be there:
"I think she would have loved the day and I think, hopefully, she'd be very proud of us both for the day. I'm just very sad that she's never going to get a chance to meet Kate."
His brother Prince Harry added: "My mother would have loved Kate."
