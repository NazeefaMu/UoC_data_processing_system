FACETS – takes Sri Lanka’s gem and jewellery industry into the 21st Century

A tiny island in the middle of the Indian Ocean was once a prominent feature in the tales of explorers, scholars and merchants who spread the fame of the troves of precious gems hidden in its earth.
The 27th Edition of the FACETS International Gem and Jewelry Exhibition held recently bore testament to the fact that the Sri Lankan gem and jewellery industry was still thriving and revolutionizing itself to meet the tastes and demands of the 21st century.
The Sirimavo Bandaranaike Memorial Exhibition Centre was filled to the brim with stalls featuring magnificent gems, dazzling jewelry and fascinating equipment.
First among the guests to visit the exhibition was Prime Minister, Ranil Wickremesinghe who expressed his admiration of some of the pieces on display.
International delegates from all over the world visited the exhibition as well as a number of foreign guests, who had come from far and wide to experience the wonder of one of Sri Lanka’s primary resources.
President Maithripala Sirisena visited the exhibition on its opening day and was extremely pleased with the glittering works on display. The premier Jewellery Pavilion and the Gem and Jewellery Mart returned once again to much acclaim from the show’s visitors.
Sapphires, diamonds, emeralds and rubies were but a few of the types of gems on display, ranging from precious to semi-precious, garnets, aquamarines, spinels, amethysts, jade, amber, jasper and lapis lazuli. Some of the jewellery on display was made of gold, silver and platinum whilst others were made of coral, wood and glass.
This year’s exhibition also featured a number of stalls showcasing laboratory equipment, artists’ tools and machines used in the manufacturing of jewellery and the mining of gems.
