Railway supervisors to launch token strike

The Alliance of Railway Operation Supervisory Officers Unions will launch a 24-hour token strike from June 4 midnight over several demands.
A spokesman for the alliance attributed the strike to several demands, including salary anomalies and vacancies in the Railway Supervisory Management Service and Railway Operations Management Service.
The trade union action is based on the lack of response to requests made to the Transport and Civil Aviation Minister.
