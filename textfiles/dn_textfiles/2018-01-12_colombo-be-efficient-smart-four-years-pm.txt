Colombo to be efficient, smart in four years -PM

Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said the UNP would make Colombo a smart and efficient city in four years.
Addressing the gathering yesterday at the ‘UNP - Bala Mandala meeting’ at Havelock city, the Prime Minister said the UNP has nominated a woman this time as the mayor of Colombo Municipal Council and he added that he believes the mayor will make Colombo a smart and an efficient city.
“Even though, UNP gained victory in Colombo, the party could not make smart moves to make Colombo a great city as the central government stood as a barrier to it. Therefore, a real change can be seen only when the UNP is in power,” he said.
He said the present government has given a long term solution to the garbage issue and it will be further strengthened after the upcoming elections.Prime Minister requested the public to refrain from electing drug addicts or such persons to local government authorities.
“I have instructed stakeholders to work with the Youth Parliament to eradicate drugs. I request all the candidates to do their best to make Colombo a drug-free city as it is a one of the major problems,” he said.
He emphasized that whilst developing the country, Colombo City also has to be developed, as it is the financial hub of the country.
He said Colombo is the stronghold of the UNP. Therefore, the party is bound to serve the people living in Colombo and improve their standard of living.
“The present government has to pay the debts for all the projects started by the former government under the name of “Beautification of Colombo’, he said. Wickremesinghe said the party intends to get the power of the central government and the Colombo city under the UNP to see a real change in the City.
