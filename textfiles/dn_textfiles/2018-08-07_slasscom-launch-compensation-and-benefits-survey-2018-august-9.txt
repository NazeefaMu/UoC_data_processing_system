SLASSCOM to launch Compensation and Benefits Survey 2018 on August 9

SLASSCOM together with PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) will launch the SLASSCOM Compensation and Benefits Survey for the year 2018 at an industry event planned for August 9.
This report will provide an in-depth analysis of the emerging human resource management trends and practices in the Sri Lankan IT and BPM sector whilst providing a comprehensive analysis of the compensation strategies along with the employee attraction, retention and engagement strategies executed by industry players. The report will also provide a skill based analysis of common skills identified to provide an understanding of the variance in pay associated with such skill sets.
The comprehensive compensation and benefits analysis will be carried out covering 150 job positions across a wide range of job families, representing the practices and perspectives of a variety of small, medium and large IT and BPM companies.
The report provides the statistical analysis of the market mean, median and percentiles for job positions in the IT and BPM sector, thereby providing the opportunity for effective forecasting and positioning. The report will also cover graduate salary scales of select job positions to provide a benchmark to the entry level salary scales in the IT/BPM sector in Sri Lanka. To provide a broader perspective, a summary of the 2019 budget proposal highlighting the key aspects that may affect the stakeholders directly associated with the IT/BPM sector and the potential investors will be included in the report.
Responding to the survey is free of charge and discounted rates are offered to the companies who participate in the survey when purchasing the report. In addition, SLASSCOM member companies enjoy a further concession. The survey will commence from 9th August and the final report will be available to the industry in December 2018.
Companies in the IT/BPM industry who are interested to take part in the survey are invited to join the initial briefing meeting with PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) on August 9, 2018 from 9 am to 11 am at the Auditorium, H One, The Hub, No 245, Ven. Muruththettuwe Ananda Nahimi Mawatha, Colombo 05.
