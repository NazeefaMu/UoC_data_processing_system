Australia name   Travis Head for              Sri Lanka ODI series

 
Rising star Travis Head appears to be firmly in Australia’s plans for their next subcontinental assignment after the young South Australian batsman was today added to the one-day international squad for the tour of Sri Lanka.
Head will join the national squad in Colombo tomorrow for the lead-up to the final Test, but coach Darren Lehmann insisted that he would not be considered for selection this week.
The 22-year-old batsman and handy off-spin bowler made his sole ODI appearance during the recent tri-series in the Caribbean, but was initially omitted from the 15-man squad named for the five-match series on the island nation.
The national call-up cuts short Head’s stint with English county side Yorkshire – where he blasted 175 in a one-day clash and posted a half century in his sole first-class appearance – but also suggests he is well and truly in the frame for next year’s four-Test tour of India.
The series looms as Australia’s most important assignment ahead of the home Ashes series in the summer of 2017-18, with the national hierarchy desperately searching for answers to the team’s Asian affliction after the shock series loss to the seventh-ranked Sri Lankans.
Head has been considered a long-term prospect for a number of years and it is hoped the experience of training with the Test squad, followed by the ODI leg of the tour, will only enhance his Test potential.
The left-hander – who Test great Greg Chappell once described as being ‘in the mould of Darren Lehmann’ - has already featured in various tours to the subcontinent, but the visit to Sri Lanka will be his first at the highest level.
Australia begin their ODI campaign against Sri Lanka on 21 August at R. Premadasa Stadium in Colombo.
Australia ODI squad: Steve Smith (captain), David Warner (vice-captain), George Bailey, Nathan Coulter-Nile, James Faulkner, Aaron Finch, Josh Hazlewood, Travis Head, Moises Henriques, Usman Khawaja, Nathan Lyon, Mitchell Marsh, Shaun Marsh, Mitchell Starc, Matthew Wade, Adam Zampa.
