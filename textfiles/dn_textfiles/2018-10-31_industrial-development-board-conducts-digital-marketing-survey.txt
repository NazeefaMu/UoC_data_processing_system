Industrial Development Board  conducts Digital Marketing survey

The Industrial Information Unit of the Centre for Entrepreneurship Development and Consultancy Service, under aegis of the Industrial Development Board of Ceylon (IDB) conducted a seminar recently on Digital Marketing via Facebook, Google and You Tube for the benefit of Small and Medium Entrepreneurs (SMEs) at the IDB Auditorium, Katubedda, Moratuwa.
As Small and Medium Entrepreneurs (SMEs) play an important role in improving the national economy of this country, they needed to be assisted to improve their vital role they play, by studying the variety of aspects of global economy to fit themselves with the new trends.
A considerable number of representatives from both State and private sector were present along with the Small and Medium Entrepreneurs (SMEs) at the inaugural seminar.
Thilina Karunanayake, a lecturer from the Marketing Department of the Kelaniya University addressed those present, encouraging them to pursue the fields they have chosen with trust and confidence as there lies their future.
It is claimed that the Sri Lanka Government planned to digitalize the activities of the entire State sector and this move in turn will impose those in the business world to recognize and improve their qualities and capabilities to do business with the world at large. The concept of digital marketing will have a greater impact and help immensely to improve the role of the Small and Medium Entrepreneurs (SMEs), who compose a greater part of the national economy.
Apart from this, the IT Unit of the IDB has decided to continue with a series of seminars and workshops to enhance the knowledge of those directly involved in the SMEs with the support of IDB Chairman, Mahinda Jinasena, IDB Director General, P.L.U. Rathnamalala, Human Resource Development Directress, Malani Ganegoda, IT, Assistant Directress, Swarna Wijekoon and Director Marketing and Media, Sarath Udayasiri.
“We are confident the proposed seminar and the future workshops would help to eradicate any fear SMEs entertain and make them voluntarily adapt to new technology and pursue vital trends, which are most beneficial to them in the long run”, IT sources said.
