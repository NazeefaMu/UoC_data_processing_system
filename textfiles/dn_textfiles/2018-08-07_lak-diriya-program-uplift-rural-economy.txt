Lak Diriya program to uplift rural economy

To carry forward the government’s economic development program, the Ministry of Public Enterprise and Kandy City Development will actively contribute towards ’Lak Diriya’, loan project.
The loan scheme was designed to uplift the economic status of rural people in the country under the patronage of Minister Lakshman Kiriella.
The “Lak Diriya” loan scheme commenced its work targeting small and medium scale entrepreneurs to start and develop new business ideas towards the developing economy; young entrepreneurs who are interested in the field of business are encouraged through this program to reach their goals.
The National Savings Bank (NSB) and the Regional Development Bank (RDB) organized the initial awareness programs for people in eight different locations across Kandy. They were educated through these mobile banking units about the banking services available to them via these government organizations.
The banks were able to elucidate the public about the simple terms and conditions of loan and on how to obtain a loan within a short period of time towards starting and uplifting their businesses.
Under the first stage of the ‘Lak Diriya’ program, the National Savings Bank (NSB) granted a total sum of Rs. 150 million between 300 selected beneficiaries. Under the second stage of the program, 324 entrepreneurs were granted loans summing up to Rs. 200 million, the program was held in Kandy and was conducted by the Regional Development Bank.
The ‘Lak Diriya’ program which was an initiative taken by the Ministry of Public Enterprise and Kandy City Development under the patronage of Lakshman Kiriella started its course in the Kandy district, running parallel with Enterprise Sri Lanka economic development program which is scheduled to be completed by 2025.
