“We are excited about being exclusive distributors for another well renowned IT and cyber security product. At a time where cyber criminals, ransomware and other malware are targeting organizations and individual PC’s, we are up on our game with Emsisoft as a software protector. We have made the product available in our dealer channels island wide and our resellers from the beginning of 2018 and are amazed with the market dominance in just a couple of months,” said Director of Sales and Marketing for Evolve Technologies, Ashan Pintoe.
Emsisoft, the leading anti-malware in the global security market is defined by its technology, protection, speed, easy interface and high back-end capability.

Commenting on the partnership with Evolve Technologies Sri Lanka, Christian Mairoll Founder and Managing Director of Emsisoft Ltd. stated, “Sri Lanka has been an interesting market for us for many years but we did not have a strong local partner. That changed once we decided to partner with Evolve Technologies and appoint them as our exclusive distributor for Sri Lanka. Their professional and dedicated team, as well as strong leadership and customer oriented approach, quickly brought positive results and showed their commitment. We are very happy with our partnership with Evolve Technologies and the opportunity to deliver our award-winning antimalware protection to customers in Sri Lanka.”
