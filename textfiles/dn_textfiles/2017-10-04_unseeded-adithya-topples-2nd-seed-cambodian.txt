Unseeded Adithya topples  2nd seed Cambodian

 Unseeded 15-year-old Sri Lankan tennis prodigy, Adithya Karunaratne who is a member of the Sri Lankan squad to ongoing ITF Astoria Women's Futures 2017 Series in Colombo created a major upset as she defeated third seed 25-year-old K. A. Andrea of Cambodia in straight sets 6/0, 3/0 with the Cambodian retired in the second set conceding victory to Lankan teenager in their singles match at the Sri Lanka Tennis Association courts yesterday. Due to Adithya's international tennis commitments she had not participated in local tournaments to earn points in order to enter the tournament as to the normal procedure. As Sri Lanka is hosting the tournament the host country is eligible to offer wild card entries and Adithya was allowed on a wild card entry.
Adithya who earned international fame at a very tender age was ranked Asia's number one in under-14 age category when she was 12 years in 2014. She is at present training under acclaimed international coaching team headed by legendary coach Joan Balcells, David Olles and a team of tennis professionals at Catalunyan (Barcelona) tennis circuit in Spain. She has proved her international credentials by winning the Catalunyan Women’s Open Masters title last year. Adithya was recently ranked 205th in the ITF Girls under-18 rankings. She is the highest ranked Sri Lankan player in international junior tennis who already has six ITF titles under her name.
The other Sri Lankan girl in action yesterday, Nethmi Waduge did not live up to expectations as her second seed French opponent, Boualem Josephine grabbed an easy win in their singles match, beating the Lankan 6/3, 6/1.
