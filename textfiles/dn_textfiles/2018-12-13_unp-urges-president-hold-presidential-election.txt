UNP urges the President to hold a Presidential election




President Maithripala Sirisena can get a clear picture about people’s consent by holding a Presidential Election instead of wasting Rs 4.5 billion in vain for holding a referendum, United National Party Parliamentarian Ajith P. Perera said.
Perera was addressing media today at Temple Trees.
He added it can be presumed that the President is going to hold a referendum with a view to receive people’s opinion on the dissolution of the Parliament. But holding a referendum is considered as an utterly wasting millions of public funds and time since the President can have an idea about public consent by holding a Presidential Election.  According to him a sum of Rs 4,500 million is needed for holding a referendum and a presidential election can also be held with that amount of money.
“Then UNP urges the President to hold a Presidential election if he wants to seek the public opinion instead of holding a referendum with using Rs. 4,500 million in vain” Perera said.
Speaking on the vote on confidence, which passed in the parliament to prove UNP leader Ranil Wickremasinghe commends the confidence of Parliament to function as Prime Minister, he said it is not abnormal that the Tamil National Alliance has been supporting the UNP and the former government where necessary. The TNA, which has now come democratic stream is labelled as terrorist organisation or as separatists by certain SLFP and Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna members, he said.
Parliamentarian Kawinda Jayawardana said that country’s economy has severely affected by this present political crisis. Accordingly, tourist arrival has come down by half. An amount of around Rs. 32 billion of foreign investments has been taken away by now, he said.    
He requested people, who love to strengthen the democracy and against the violation of constitution to rally round with the UNP lead continuous protect campaign scheduled to be launch from next 17th.
