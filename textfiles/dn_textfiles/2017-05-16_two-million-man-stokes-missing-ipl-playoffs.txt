Two-million man Stokes missing for IPL playoffs

New Delhi: Rising Pune Supergiant will head into this week’s Indian Premier League play-offs without star all-rounder Ben Stokes after he was recalled to England’s one-day international squad.
Stokes -- paid a record $2.16 million to play the eight-week IPL season -- was instrumental to Pune reaching the knockout phase after a brilliant debut campaign in the cash-rich Twenty20 competition.
The 25-year-old left-handed batsman and right-handed pace bowler scored 316 runs in 12 matches, with a highest of 103 not out, and took 12 wickets. AFP
