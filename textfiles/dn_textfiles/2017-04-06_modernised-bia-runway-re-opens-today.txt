The rehabilitated runway will be able to accommodate A380s as the width of the runway has been increased to 75 metres from 60 metres.
Rehabilitation work has been conducted according to the technology from the Netherlands while the energy efficient LED Light system has been installed for ground lighting on the runaway. This will make it easy for pilots and would also ensure a 80 percent saving of energy,” the Minister said.
