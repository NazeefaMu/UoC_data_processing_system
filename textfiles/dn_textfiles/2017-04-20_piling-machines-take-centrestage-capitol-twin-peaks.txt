Piling machines take centrestage at Capitol Twin Peaks

The construction of Capitol Twin Peaks, the 470 apartment twin tower project developed by Capitol Developers Limited at 24, Staple Street, Colombo 2 is progressing rapidly.
Within a short period since its ground-breaking ceremony on November 12, 2016, progress has been achieved at the project site. Capitol Developers has presently deployed five piling machines to accelerate construction to meet scheduled completion dates of the project by 2020.
One of these pilling machines,the Bauer BG 30, is the largest piling machine of its kind in Sri Lanka. Deploying this piling machine and four others at one project site is a rare occurrence, as it requires advanced technical skill and a strong investment commitment from the developer.
Capitol Developer's ability to make this happen is directly related to the fact that it is part of the Sanken Group and that the group company Sanken Construction is the design and build partner for Capitol TwinPeaks. Having 360-degree access for all its project needs in-house ensures that Capitol developers does not have to outsource functions such as piling work, thereby maintaining full control over every aspect of the construction.
These strong group synergies lend the Capitol Developers and the Capitol TwinPeaks project a unique advantage which it will leverage on to make this project the most coveted real estate marvel in the city.
On time and in full delivery is important to Capitol Developers, Sanken Construction and the Sanken Group as evidenced by the success of their previous projects. As creators of most of Colombo's skyline, timeliness and maintaining their credibility are top priorities that customers of Capitol TwinPeaks can expect.
Capitol Developers,a member of the Sanken Group has completed Capitol Residencies, HR Residencies, Tulasi Mahal Apartments in Jaffna; the business city hotel, Cinnamon Red, Capitol 7 on Rosmead Place and Capitol Elite on Horton Place.
Sanken Construction has delivered Trillium Residencies, Empire City, Emperor, OnThree20, 7th sense on Gregory's Road and many other high-rises in the city.
