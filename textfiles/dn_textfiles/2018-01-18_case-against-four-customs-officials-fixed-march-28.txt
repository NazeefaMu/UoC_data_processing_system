Case against four Customs officials fixed for March 28

The Colombo High Court yesterday fixed for March 28 a case against four former senior Customs officials in connection with the largest-ever recorded bribe nabbed by the Bribery Commission.
The Director General of Commission to Investigate Allegations of Bribery or Corruption filed indictments against Assistant Customs Superintendent Upali Gunaratne Perera, Customs Superintendent Wasantha Wimalaweera, Customs Superintendent Upali Wickremasinghe and Customs Superintendent Sudeera Jinadasa for allegedly accepting a bribe of Rs.125 million to release a consignment of spare parts worth Rs.1,500 million, imported to be used by the SLTB, by evading duty.
When the case came up before High Court Judge R. Gurusinghe, the defence party was given permission to access with the computerized evidence.
The Bribery Commission filed indictments against the accused on 14 counts. The prosecution further alleged that the four accused had committed these offences on or around June 26, 2015, under Section 11 of the Commission to Investigate Allegations of Bribery or Corruption Act No. 19 of 1994.
