Bandula blames weak economic management for fuel price hike

The cause of the increase in fuel prices is due to the weakening of the government’s economic management, MP Bandula Gunawardena said yesterday.
“If there is no question raised about it, I will ready for an intellectual debate with any powerful person in the government,” he said.
Addressing a press conference organised by the Joint Opposition Economic Research unit at the Vajirasrama Buddhist Centre in Borella, Gunawardena said, “The price of a litre of kerosene during Mahinda Rajapaksa’s regime was Rs. 81. In 2015, it was reduced to Rs. 46. Then after Rs. 44, that price has been revised by the new increased price. After the new increase, fuel prices have gone up even more than during Mahinda Rajapakse’s era. At that time, the price of oil barrels in the international market was as high as US$ 100 a year. Now its average price is US$ 58. The present time cannot be compared to Mahinda Rajapaksa’s era. At that time, there were challenges. It is our government that has faced all these challenges.”
He said if a price formula had been introduced in the Rajapaksa regime, people would not have been able to afford fuel. That is why a stock of 350 kg fertilizer was given to the farmers.
