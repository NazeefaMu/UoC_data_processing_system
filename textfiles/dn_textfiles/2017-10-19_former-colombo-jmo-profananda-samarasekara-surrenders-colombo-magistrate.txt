Former Colombo JMO Prof.Ananda Samarasekara surrenders to Colombo Magistrate court

 
Former Colombo Chief Medical Officer Prof.Ananda Samarasekara surrendered before Colombo Magistrate court a short while ago in connection with the alleged loss of body parts of late Wasim Thajudeen.
On October 2 CID sought a warrant for the arrest of Prof.Ananda Samarasekara over the alleged role in the cover up of evidence when conducting the first post mortem on Thajudeen’s body.
Prof. Samarasekara had filed a Fundamental Rights petition in the Supreme Court seeking an interim order preventing CID from arresting him in connection with the alleged loss of body parts of late Wasim Thajudeen.
