LTTE conflict an example for radical extremism: Canadian delegate

The LTTE conflict was an example for radical extremism, which prevailed for more than 30 years, having been influenced by the history of conflicts elsewhere, Borealis Threat and Risk Consulting Ltd, Canada, President and CEO Phil Gurski said.
He was speaking at the Colombo Defence Seminar at the BMICH on the sub topic ‘Definitions and Root Causes’ under ‘Violent Extremism’.
Gurski said individual radicalisation seems to have developed into an ideology to become a conflict.
Violent radicalisation could also develop due to mental illness, egoism, radical extremisms and ideologies, he said.
“There is no logical formula to identify violent extremists. It depends on social status, communities, religion and sometimes, due to individual processes which in turn would develop to be a radical violent extremism that could cause a conflict,” he said.
Adoption of bad programmes, unnecessary agendas may also cause a conflict. Why people become violent? Poverty, lack of education, lack of money, mental illness and ideology mainly drive them to extreme conflicts, he said.
