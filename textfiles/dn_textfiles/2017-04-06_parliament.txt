Parliament

Agreements concerning H’tota Port project will be presented in House: PM
All agreements entered into between Sri Lanka and the Chinese Company in relation to the Hambantota Development Project would be presented to Parliament following the agreement being inked, said Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe in Parliament yesterday.
He also said that the government had no preliminary agreement entered into with a Chinese company to continue with the Hambantota Port project.
The Premier made these observations yesterday, in response to a question raised by Joint Opposition Parliamentarian MP Dullas Alahapperuma.Those who planned to set up a port at Hambantota during the last government, predicted that all ships navigating the Indian Ocean would arrive there to obtain its services and to pump oil, but their plans were far from reality, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe told Parliament yesterday.
“They thought that ships would come there the way vehicles come to petrol sheds at Alexandra Road in Colombo and to many other petrol sheds to pump fuel. Ships do not come to harbours in that manner. Not only their policy planning was wrong, but also the agreements they entered into with China over the Hambantota Port were not favourable to our country,” Premier Wickremesinghe said.
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said that there was no draft bill to sell the Hambantota Port to a Chinese Company. “I will reveal everything with regard to the Hambantota Port project since its inception,” Premier Wickremesinghe said. “Former President Mahinda Rajapaksa took a loan from Exim Bank in 2012 for the construction of the Hambantota Port. The grace period was 48 months and thereafter, the loan had to be settled. At least a petrol shed could not earn profits within four years. We had to settle the loan since 2016. According to article 14 of the agreement, in the event of default of paying a premium, we would have to settle the entire loan and the interest. It is about US$ 1,400 million. How could it be done by those who can’t settle at least one premium.”
However, he also said the then President Mahinda Rajapaksa came up with a new proposal as the Port suffered a loss. When the Chinese President visited Sri Lanka, a Government to Government agreement to assist the Silk Road project and to continue with the Hambantota Port Project was initiated. “It was a new agreement”, the Premier said. “It was a SOT(Supply, Operate and Transfer) agreement. We had invested 35.2 percent, while the Chinese Government the rest. But the Chinese company included its interest in to the investment too. The previous government had sold the country. Hadn’t it? Another condition in the agreement was that the Chinese Company would not develop the completing Infrastructure for a period of eight years. So we pay the loan and give eight years to them to do whatever they want. Isn’t it selling the country?”
The Premier also said the previous plans envisaged to give outright ownership of the Hambantota Port terminal to a Chinese company. “Soon after we came to power, we went for re-negotiations. We got the term outright ownership for the Chinese company removed. We pointed out to the Chinese government that the agreement they signed with our predecessors were not for the best interests of Sri Lanka and we needed to re-negotiate the terms. The Chinese government agreed. They named two Chinese companies, China Merchants and China Harbour,” the Premier said. “We are holding discussions with them. This evening too there is another round of talks to be held. Instead of handing over the port to a Chinese company, we intend to convert it into a joint venture. The previous arrangement was to go for a SOT (Supply, Operate and Transfer) agreement. We changed this into an agreement with clauses and terms more favourable to our country.”
He also said that the companies were in the SOT agreement entered into by former President Mahinda Rajapaksa. “However, with the new joint venture they agreed to allow us to lend it even to some other country,” the Premier said. “Thereafter the Chinese Company in the joint venture agreed to pay us US$ 1,100 million and so far we had settled US$ 300 million to the Exim Bank. When it is given, our loan can be settled two years earlier.”
He said in the new agreement this government pointed out Sri Lanka was the hub in the Silk route and China agreed. In the new agreement both have agreed to develop the infrastructure such as the port and to promote joint businesses by sharing culture, economy, science and technology in a manner where both countries share equal benefits.
“The previous government had agreed to grant out right ownership of the Colombo Port City to the Chinese Company,” the Premier said. “I removed it from the agreement. If it were given, the exclusive economic zone in the sea would be owned by the China Harbour Company. Hadn’t the previous government sold the country? Now we attempt to lease this and reduce the loans and VAT. Do you object ?”
Joint Opposition Member Dullas Alahapperuma raising a question demanded the Hambantota Port agreement be presented in Parliament. He added that it is said a draft bill has been formulated to sell the Hambantota harbour and Cabinet has granted its approval. He added however the relevant minister had said the Cabinet approval had not been granted, but a Cabinet sub committee had been appointed on the matter.
“As it is said that Minister Patali Champika Ranawaka had resigned from the said sub Committee and as Vasudeva Nanayakkara has filed a case before the Supreme Court on this matter, the people need to know about it. So we need to know as to whether the Prime Minister would present the agreement on the Hambantota Port Development Project which is said to have approved,” Alahapperuma said. “The experts think the 99 year lease of 80 percent of the port affects the national economy and the national security. It is said that the Port Minister too objected to the agreement saying that there could be one with much advantages to the country.” He added that a newspaper had carried a news item that a Chinese investors had come to Colombo to buy the Hambantota Port.
Dullas Alahapperuma said that a land extension of 500 acres belonging to the Ports Authority had been leased for 99 years at a rate of Rs 494 million per year. “But a 4 hectare land already had been granted to a Gas company at a rate of US$ 50,000 each” Alahapperuma said. “Why can’t the 500 acre be leased out at such a rate?”
Premier Wickremesinghe responding to MP Alahapperuma said how could some one sell a 50 acre land at a rate of 20 per perch. He said that there was nothing to talk with some one who did not understand such a small matter. He added that a land which is near the road had been leased at the rate of US$ 50,000 per hectare.
Aluthgamage’s house in UK: Dy Minister Ramanayake tables document involving MP
Deputy Minister Ranjan Ramanayake yesterday in Parliament, tabled a document obtained from UK authorities over a house in London allegedly owned by MP Mahindananda Aluthgamage.
The Deputy Minister said the house which was purchased for Sterling Pounds 320,000 by Asha Aluthgamage and Mahindananda Aluthgamage in 2008, had been reportedly sold at Sterling Pounds 470,000. He requested investigative bodies to look into this property.
“Certain MPs, who were spending ordinary lives, acquired enormous wealth disproportionate to their known incomes after they entered Parliament. I request the investigative bodies to probe into these properties, apple gardens and Panama Papers,” he said.
However, UPFA MP Vasudeva Nanayakkara pointed out that it was improper to make allegations against an MP when he was not present to reply. “Either you bring in a substantive motion in this regard or make the statement when the MP is around to reply,” he said.
Deputy Minister Ramanayake, who first mentioned that the house was owned by an ‘Aluthgamage’, was asked by other members to reveal the name properly as UNP MP Ananda Aluthgamage rose to a point of order demanding that he reveal the full name.
Former Chief Justice was also appointed from unofficial bar: Dilan Perera
Former Chief Justice Dr Shirani Bandaranayake was also initially appointed as a Supreme Court Judge from the unofficial bar, State Minister Dilan Perera said.
He was commenting on the controversy surrounding the appointment of Ramanathan Kannan as a High Court Judge.
“Supreme Court Judges, Appeal Court Judges and High Court Judges have been appointed from the unofficial bar even during the past. Some are attempting to give it a racial twist, and I strongly condemn it,” he said.
UPFA MP Dullas Allahapperuma pointed out that the next in line in the eligible list for the appointment was also a Tamil speaking person. Replying to this concern, Perera said he too has a problem with the appointment, adding that his opposition is only for those who criticize the appointment on racial lines.
He also pointed out that Constitutional Reforms could provide answers to most of the prevailing problems in the Judiciary. He said almost all in the Steering Committee are in agreement with the proposals with regard to the Judiciary.
Misleading court by concealing vital information a serious offence: PM
The Joint Opposition Parliamentarian who filed a case before the Supreme Court would have to apologize to the Supreme Court by offering a sheaf of betel for misleading the Court by concealing some vital important in the case that he filed against the Hambantota Port agreement, said Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe in Parliament yesterday.
He made this observation in response to a statement made by Joint Opposition member Dullas Alahapperuma in Parliament saying that MP Vasudeva Nanayakkara had filed a case before Court against the Hambantota Port agreement.
The Premier further said that the previous government entered into the agreement with the Chinese Government on the Colombo Port City Project and the Hambantota Port Development projects. “The Joint Opposition member without revealing that he was a Cabinet Minister then, had filed a case as if was ignorant of the government to government agreement,” the Premier said. “We are waiting until he appears in court. He will have to be imprisoned for concealing important facts to Court. But as the petitioner is my friend, I don’t plead to do so. But he will have to pay a fine,”
The Premier also said that it seemed that the Joint Opposition members have a desire to be imprisoned.
MP Vasudeva Nanayakkara who said that he had filed a case before Court on the questioned matter and MP Alahapperuma who mentioned it in Parliament, said that the Premier’s statement that he would have to be imprisoned was wrong.
Responding to it, the Premier said that he did not say something, but said that JO members seemed to have a desire to be imprisoned.
Due to arms, drugs smuggling and anti-human trafficking: Silawathura and Mullikulam Navy camps will not be moved: PM
The government would not move out the Navy camps set up in Silawathura and Mullikulam as they were essential to prevent arms and drugs smuggling and anti-human trafficking operations, said Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe in Parliament yesterday.
He made this observation in response to a question raised by SLMC Parliamentarian MHM Salman who demanded that the Navy base in Silawathura be shifted and the lands should be given to civilians.
The Prime Minister said that a Navy Base had been established in Silawathura Grama Niladhari Division of the Musali Divisional Secretary Division of the Mannar District. He added that the location of the Navy base is strategically important for National Security and to combat arms and drug smuggling taking place off the North-Western and Northern coasts. “It is an important location in terms of the preventing illegal migration and illegal transportation of goods too,” Premier Wickremesinghe said.
The Premier also said the Sri Lanka Navy is currently occupying a land in extent of 34 acres, 02 roods and 8.43 perches. “It had already been decided to release 06 acres, 02 roods and 8.43 perches out of this land,” the Premier said. “Action is being taken to release this portion of land to the owners, through the Divisional Secretary, Musali.” He added that so far, 66 persons have claimed ownership of the land. Out of this number, 38 persons are dead. The Government has given alternate lands of 20 perches each to 12 persons and 04 houses have been constructed.
The Premier also said that action is being taken to acquire the land to the Government for the use of the Sri Lanka Navy under the Land Acquisition Act. He also said that instructions have already been given to the Divisional Secretary – Musali to make the necessary arrangements to provide compensation to the lawful owners of the lands according to Government valuation.
In the meantime, responding to a question raised by TNA Parliamentarian Charles Nirmalanathan who urged the government vacate the Navy camp at Mullikulam and return the lands back to the civilians there, the Premier said that the Navy camp had been set up in government lands so that there was no need to remove it.
Resolution to increase wages of judiciary gets Parliament nod
Parliament yesterday, approved a resolution to increase the salaries of the Chief Justice and Supreme Court and Appeal Court Judges.
The Justice Minister moving the resolution for debate, said that the salary structures of judges in other courts too would be revised shortly.
He however stressed that the resolution had no connection with the salaries of MPs and Ministers. He made this clarification referring to certain media reports that said the revision of salaries of judges was a means to raise the salaries of Parliamentarians.
The minister participating in the debate, said a new method would be introduced in granting promotions to judges. “There is no proper mechanism in this regard. Seniority is the only criterion being considered at present. We had discussions with the Chief Justice to provide marks also for commitment, skills and fervour of the judges, in addition to their seniority when granting of promotions,” he said.
The minister said that attention had also been drawn to increase the number of Supreme Court judges in the country, considering the increasing number of cases in Courts of Law. He said a total of 745,000 cases were in the country’s courts of law during the end of 2016.
He also said that 3,566 cases were before the Supreme Court, while 4,637 cases were before the Appeal Court during the end of 2016.
