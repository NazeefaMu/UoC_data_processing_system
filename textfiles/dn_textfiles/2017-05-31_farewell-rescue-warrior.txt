Farewell rescue warrior

A half-built house, his wife; 36-year-old K. Lakmali and a young son Anursara Lakshan, is what 37-year-old Warrant Officer Senaka Yaparathna of the Sri Lanka Air Force (SLAF) leaves behind.
His home, located almost 2km from the SLAF Trade Training School in Ekala, is surrounded by airmen. They also occupy the cemetery nearby, building an extravagant burial site for their fellow serviceman. As one approaches his house, in Kotugoda, a man known to be ‘humble, friendly and an all-rounder’ by his family and friends is now a local as well as national hero.
Yaparathna, along with his wife and son moved into the area around four years ago and those who attended his funeral are either relatives from his wife’s home town of Nittambuwa or from his own in Dehiattakandiya and his friends and colleagues from the Air Force. He is also graced by a continuous train of politicians from the area and province who flood in to their home, glad to share the limelight of the hero.
The local government authorities have also made arrangements to supply drinking water to his house as the region unlike other parts continues to suffer acute water scarcity.
“I did not know he was such a hero, he would only send me pictures when he passed his various training courses. Many politicians have come, they say they did not know that such a hero lived in the Western province,” said Chapa Anjali Yaparathna, his 42-yeaar-old elder sister as she greeted guests at the door.
On May 27, Yaparathna helped airlift a stranded woman from the Neluwa area in Galle by suspending himself on a cord hanging from the helicopter; she was rescued but he fell. The late sergeant fell to his death at 25ft from the ground.
Yaparathna who had served the SLAF for the last 17 years, was promoted to the rank of Warrant Officer on May 28 and provided him with a ceremonial burial on Monday (29).
Why did he fall?
As disasters plague the country one after another, the SLAF has taken on a major role in rescue operations, otherwise inaccessible to other forces. During the recent floods, the Air Force deployed 13 helicopters and two fixed wing air crafts for flood relief and rescue operations. From Saturday to Monday alone, the pilots had completed 100 flying hours. On Monday, 143 sorties were carried out while 65 were done on Saturday. The Air Force is also providing around 15,000 cooked meal packets per day to flood victims.
Given the flurry of activity along with Yaparathna’s death, questions have risen over whether there has been a case of negligence or lack of quality control in equipment used in rescue operations. Sources within the Air Force however revealed that while the same cords and ropes were used continuously in many operations, over the years, there may have been lapses in ensuring that required standards were maintained.
“The cable did not break, it was intact- we are not aware conclusively of how it happened,” said SLAF Spokesman, Group Captain, Gihan Seneviratne, when questioned on how the accident took place.
“Newspaper reports state that the cable he was hoisted on brought the woman back up and then he fell, when it was sent back to rescue him. Another person was sent using the same cable to rescue others too, there is no problem with the cable,” stressed the SLAF Spokesman further.
He assured that there would be an investigation to find out what really happened.
“We have never claimed that the cable had broken and until such time the investigation report is out, we don’t want to cast aspersions at him or the Air force,” said the Group Captain. He observed that it was an inherently dangerous job and added, “These things can happen, we are aware of the danger and we take precautions but at the end of the day we need to get the job done.” Yaparathna too was aware of the danger and responsibility of his task. His brother, Shan Yaparathna, 41, recalled that he was always the first to volunteer for any fire and rescue operation. He proudly explained that even the Air Force Commander had noted that his brother had an exemplary service record.
“He was on leave on that day and had to go for a wedding, but he cancelled all plans and said he had to go to Galle to save people from the floods,” said Shan. “He has been involved in rescue operations for some time, he was also in the Iranamadu camp and at Batticaloa during the war. Since then, he has got involved in almost every rescue operation from building collapses to landslides,” he added.
His aunt, Nandani Tennekoon remarked that they hardly used to see him around as he was very committed to his work. “The last time we visited, he was involved in rescue operations in Meethotamulla,” she said.
“We have served in the Air Force together for the last 12 years, he was a great all-rounder. He has been training in rescue operations for the last 10-12 years,” said Sanjeewa Attapattu, 38, his colleague and brother-in-law.
Yaparathna, who enlisted in the in the Air Force on January 19, 2001, received his basic training at CTS Diyathalawa and advance training at SLAF, TTS Ekala. He has served at the SLAF Base Katunayaka, SLAF Base Anuradhapura, SLAF Base Rathmalana, SLAF Station Colombo, SLAF Station Batticaloa, SLAF Station Iranamadu and SLAF Trade Training School, as a reputed fire and rescue operator.
His training included the basic RED course, Air rescue course, Bronto Skylift course, fire all-round driver and Air Field driving. Hence it seems unlikely that he would be careless in his operations.
As the floods continue, the SLAF had its second mishap with a SLAF Mi 17 Helicopter crash landing in Baddegama when delivering food items. A technical fault in the aircraft has been cited as the main reason for the crash. No casualties were reported.
“We are not sure what caused the crash but there will be an investigation. We know that there was a technical fault in the helicopter, the pilot had sounded the emergency and fortunately it was flying low as it was approaching Baddegama. The ground condition was not that good so all he saw was water, not an ideal condition for landing, which caused some damage to the air craft. Don’t know what happened,” explained Group Captain Seneviratne.
He reiterated that all air crafts underwent stringent tests every day before they were flown and that this was unexpected.
A hero’s death
Back in Kotugoda, Yaparathna’s family is preparing to say their farewells. His father, can barely walk and sits in almost a trance as he said that he found solace in the fact that his son died a hero.
“My son has been immortalized in our country’s history as one who sacrificed his life to save others. He is a brave man, and that is how I pacify my heart,” said the former forest officer turned farmer.
“I got him educated at two schools, first in the Dehiattakandiya Sooriyapperuma School and then I sent him to the Asgiri Maha Pirivena. He got to a good place through his grades.
His first duty was for me, he told me that he would build me a house so that we will have a proper place to have a funeral. But, I am here for his,” said Senior Yaparathna close to tears.
Chapa who looked after her two younger brothers, Shan and Senaka after their mother’s demise when the latter was one and a half years old, too is coming to peace with the fact that her brother died a martyr.
“I am proud of him but this is too much to bear,” she said and added that it was she who filled out the application for him to join the Air Force. “He was chosen to study in the Science stream at university, but he said he could not wait too long for the results, so I was the one who asked him to apply to the Air Force and sent in the application,” said Chapa as she turned to tell Senaka’s story once again to a new group of visitors.

“The son from the Air Force came down from the helicopter and threw a rope towards me. Then he got me on something like a boat and rescued me. I did not know that he fell while trying to rescue me. I got to know that the son who rescued me had fallen and died after I came to hospital,” said A.D. Gnanawathi who is currently receiving treatment at the Karapitiya Teaching hospital. She was gravely injured when the Neluwa Duwili Ella Tea Factory canteen collapsed due to the recent heavy rains. “At around 12 am, our bosses came and informed us that there were landslides on the mountain next to us and that we should evacuate immediately. As they said that, the mountain collapsed all at once. We did not even have time to run. Two of us got trapped in a room at the front. They tried to rescue us but failed to do so. As the heavy rains continued, we were soaked to the bone by it and we lay there till morning.
Around 6.30 am we were rescued. My legs were trapped underneath a block of concrete so they could not take me out of there,” she recalled.
“It is then that they came in the helicopter and threw a rope to me.
I was then taken by a boat. I did not know that the boy who rescued me, fell. I am heartbroken by this news, it is hard for me to bear,” added Gnanawathi as she recovers from her injuries. The collapse of the Duwili Ella Tea Factory due to a landslide killed eight people. Gnanawathi and one other woman are its sole survivors.
