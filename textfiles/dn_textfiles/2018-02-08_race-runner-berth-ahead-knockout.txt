The race for the runner-up berth ahead of knockout

The new season 2018, seems a lot more relentless than the last calm days of December 2017....so much has already happened in this current Dialog league and still more anticipation with the last few matches on the cards.
Kandy already own the trophy and can rotate players with the luxury of a job well done ..and with a minimum of traditional drama too.
Accepted they carry the best depth and quality both on the pitch and off the bench as well.
The clinical nature of their strategy has been untouchable this season, and envied by thousands.
The lions have roared and delivered as required ...enough proof last week when then played catch up rugby to beat Army from behind in the last quarter....and celebration all round, especially their diehard faithful, face paint and lion kit all inclusive.
The pride in yet another title echoed way beyond the Nittawela cauldron and huge inspiration for another 5 generations of school kids watching avidly from the stands and throughout the central district..... its a monumental achievement in that sense, and full credit to a grand committee for pulling it off.
But alas, that is only the tip of the proverbial iceberg in chilly Colombo? The days have changed, it’s still pitch dark at 6am and jumper weather in the city by the sea ...mornings are visibly colder and till 6.30ish too dark to start jogging etc...The evening, thank the experts and greater beings upon Mount Olympus...is still longer and light enough by 7pm to be enjoyed by all rugby hearts island wide.
That iceberg, I hear you claim....indeed it is that battle for 2nd and 3rd in the league ...that is directly and hugely significant for the knockouts that loom larger than life itself.
The Dialog knockout is also Sri Lanka rugby’s most treasured possession ...and none other than that famous bone of utter contention, kindly and generously gifted by Lady Clifford to separate the men from the boys in the middle.
During my playing days, the 80s and the 90s, the Clifford Cup was jealously guarded by the SLRFU within its close confines at Longdon Place for outright battle.
The stature of the tournament and prestige, reflected by the thousands that jam packed all venues irrespective of any creature comforts, and happily stood, rain or shine, to watch our Sri islanders run out to thunderous applause and massive cheering for the entire match.
The atmosphere, a shade more electric than the mind could handle.
Players were mobbed when they scored and passion for the code and after match social, pretty intense and highly regarded.
Amidst all this, a brand of running rugby and skills that had many swooning left, right and centre.
Havelocks, CR&FC, CH&FC, Kandy, commanding respect and adulation on an unimaginable level ....every weekend was huge and massively partisan. It divided friends, family, school, neighbours and even the local markets.
Shopping was an experience and plenty of gifts had the home team won and your try the clincher....rugby was simple, gloriously amateur, and driven by skill and passion to its core.
In 2018 the Clifford Cup will herald the knockout phase of Sri Lanka rugby’s impressive and busy calendar, which includes...The league, the knockouts, the club 7s, the regional Asian 15s series, the Asian 7s circuit, the Super 7s here at home, the Commonwealth and Asian Games 7s plus the juniors Asian tours as well.
All told an intensive essay of blood and guts that leaves no room for soft thoughts and less performance based on luck.
The game is entirely professional and demands standards that must be matched both on and off the field....from training to ice baths, from oxygen tents to selectors on tour and everything in between the posts. Survival is the challenge!
Friday this week is February 2018 and in more ways the battle for 2nd and 3rd clearly the defining thoughts amongst all reasonable islanders contemplating this month of Independence...and Sri island rugby in all its Suntan colours?
Who will it be ..Havies, the Sailors or Maitland boys showing sparkling finish over the last two weekends?
CH vs CR at Longdon Place on Friday 9th 4pm.
Havelocks vs Kandy at Nittawela on Sunday 11th 4pm.
Both are mighty significant and a grand reflection of the battle lines to decide who will face the league champs in the knockouts...
It’s an all or nothing theory based on fitness, performance, mind, skills and fundamental to all ...injuries to key players?
This assurance is key to morale in the dressing room plus mind wellness and strength in the middle ...there is no greater luxury for a coach and management, than having your full squad fit and ready, injury managed and pride intact for the confrontation.
The psychology of knowledge is vital and most telling ...under pressure and victory at stake .....its too intense for casual thoughts and less belief.
News buzzing and heating the rugby wires this week has been a fab step up for the Maitland Crescent marauders signing Sri captain and ex Havelocks mainstay ..Sudarshan Muthutanthri. He was away in NZ playing for Auckland in the recent national 7s tournament.
Muthu is the best back row forward in Sri, has phenomenal workrate, is efficient both in attack and defence ...has been rated by the Japanese and gives CH a massive intravenous shot in their performance arm.
The endorphins will flow as long as those breakdowns are sorted and balls ripped for turnovers.
Muthu, Sasanka and in form tank Yoshita will add dimension and lethal finish to the biggest hearts from Maitland. Prospects for even more inspiration and fight in the CH corner just stepped up.
Skipper Rohitha will be most comfortable having his fellow Thomian forward joining the hard graft boiler house unit ..and some good memories from STC XVs season, which ‘chi chi’ also captained.
Watch out for Muthus skill fitness and superior power at the graft work on the deck ...The reason he is hailed as the islands best ball dog by miles.
Island rugby is buzzing and the players great examples to the school kids watching ....at all levels.
Top marks to the papare.com network for keeping the rugby yards as intense around this partially green globe ...much credit to Ganeesha David, whose passion for the game and efficiency, is the next level ....and sets the papare roll out as a strong working unit.
Enjoy all of this and the league breathing its heaviest last quarter before the Clifford Cup grips our senses and rewires those expectations...it’s been the best so far, but only a small sample of the battles ahead ..Cheers cheers and calm and collected to the middle.
It’s all to play for this intimidating month of 28.
Bula bula Sri Api!
