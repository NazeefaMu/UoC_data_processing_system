NCPC Governor rejects affidavits

North Central Province Council Governor P.B.Dissanayaka yesterday rejected 17 affidavits submitted by a group of United People’s Freedom Alliance (UPFA) members that sought the removal of North Central Province Chief Minister Peshala Jayaratne from his portfolio.
Further, they called Governor Dissanayaka to appoint the province’s former Chief Minister S.M.Ranjith Samarakoon to that post because they have neither confidence nor trust in Peshala Jayaratne.
They charged Peshala Jayaratne stating that he had expelled an NCP Minister,namely K.H.Nandasena, arbitrarily from his post.
S.M Ranjith resigned from the position held by him as the North Central Province Chief Minister consequent to the removal of Minister Nandasena.
Governor Dissanayaka is said to have rejected the affidavits submitted by the group of UPFA members saying that they do not comply with the 13th Amendment of the Constitution.
