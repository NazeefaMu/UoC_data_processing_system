Saltwater mixing into freshwater sources in Kalutara:
Government to provide solutions before 2020

The City Planning and Water Supply Ministry has initiated a project to provide a solution to the mixing of salt water into freshwater sources in the Kalutara district.
The project is expected to be completed by 2020.
City Planning and Water Supply Minister Rauff Hakeem said so at a public gathering, following the foundation stone laying ceremony for the Aluthgama-Matugama-Agalawatta integrated water project.
“We expect to implement this project before the expiration of our government’s term in 2020. In addition, we will take steps to inaugurate a number of community water projects as a solution to rural villages in this district,” he said.
“The Water Supply Board has not received government funds. However, we launched projects with local and international donor assistance. We have to be mindful of repaying this money,” he added.
At present, the government only provides portable drinking water to half the population.
“We should especially be grateful to India for providing us with financial assistance to the tune of US $ 500 million. During his Sri Lanka’s, visit Prime Minister Narendra Modi has agreed to provide us this loan at a low-interest rate. At present, a number of Indian companies work in this sector as contractors,” the minister said.
The project is funded by the EXIM Bank India and Bank of Ceylon. They will provide Rs. 24,285 million and Rs. 4,286 million respectively while the government’s contribution is Rs. 3,707 million. The total cost of the project is Rs. 32,278 million.
The main contractor for this project - Iron Exchange India Private Limited - is sponsored by the City Planning and Water Supply Ministry and is launched by the National Water Supply and Drainage Board.
Through this project, it is expected to meet the water needs of 300,000 people by providing 32,000 new water connections by 2020 and to 573,000 people by 2030.
One of the main objectives of this project is to take steps to resolve the issue of salt water mixing with drinking water by constructing a new plant in Nahalla Kole Modara to provide 78,705 cubic metres daily and adding a new water transmission plant up to the Kethhena water purification station.
The project will be completed within three years covering 269 Grama Niladhari Divisions in Matugama, Dodamgods, Kalutara, Beruwala, Agalawatta and Madurawala Divisional Secretariats.
