JO is not our enemy: SB

Social Empowerment and Welfare Minister S. B. Dissanayake said he did not consider the group of Joint Opposition (JO) members in parliament as enemies.
He was speaking to the media after laying foundation stones to the Bemiya, Unantenne bridge in Hewaheta on January 21. Asked about JO plans to hold a separate rally on January 27, Minister Dissanayake said the JO was still a friendly and brotherly group and if they had planned a rally he would extend his blessings for their meeting.
He said people attending the JO rally were meeting the President and him by night. We do not have problem about their rally, the minister said. The local government election would be held under the ward system and all should joint hands as the party would be able to field a single candidate for each electroate, he said.
