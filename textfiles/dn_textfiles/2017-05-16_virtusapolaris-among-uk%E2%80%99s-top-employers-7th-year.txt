VirtusaPolaris among UK’s top employers for 7th year

VirtusaPolaris, the market-facing brand of Virtusa Corporation and Polaris Consulting & Services and a leading worldwide provider of IT consulting and outsourcing services has been certified as one of the UK's Top Employers.
This is the seventh consecutive year that Virtusa wins this award and the first for VirtusaPolaris since the acquisition.
The annual international research from the Top Employers' Institute recognises leading employers around the world: those that provide excellent employee conditions, nurture and develop talent throughout all levels of the organisation, and those which strive to continuously improve employment practices.
"To be recognised as one of UK's best employers not once, but seven times, is a real honour," said VirtusaPolaris' Chief People Officer Sundararajan Narayanan. "Since last year's acquisition of Polaris Consulting & Services, we have strengthened our workforce into one global team. Retaining a sense of shared culture and teamwork among team members during this time of change was one of our highest priorities, which makes this award feel like even more of an achievement. We're delighted that the Top Employers' Institute has recognised this and we're proud to be able to offer a collaborative, stimulating and exciting workplace that is consistently one of the UK's best."
"Innovation is our mantra, and is at the centre of everything our team members work on," said VirtusaPolaris EVP and Chief Strategy Officer Tom Holler. "As we enter the era of the fourth industrial revolution and fields such as robotics and artificial intelligence begin to grow, attracting the best talent is more competitive than ever. Being named again as a Top Employer in the UK, underlines the success of our appeal to a new generation of creative and skilled professionals. We will continue to invest in creating an environment where the millennial generation workforce can thrive and excel."
The Top Employers' Institute globally certifies excellence in the conditions that employers create for their people. Established in 1991, the Top Employers' Institute uses international standards and independent research to identify those companies excelling in HR management.
