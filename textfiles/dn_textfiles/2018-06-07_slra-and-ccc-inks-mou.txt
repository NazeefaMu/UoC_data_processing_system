SLRA and CCC inks mou

The Sri Lanka Retailers’ Association (SLRA) recently signed a memorandum of understanding with the Ceylon Chamber of Commerce, for support in organizing and coordinating the Sri Lanka Retail Forum for the second consecutive year.
With last year’s Retail Forum seeing success in creating a platform for the Retail Industry to discuss challenges and explore new strategies, the SLRA will be organizing the forum for the second consecutive year this October.
This year’s forum seeks to discuss methods of reshaping customer engagement, generating further digitization in the industry at large, building a competitive brand culture through sustainable practice, propelling the local retail industry, and exploring a tourism-retail nexus. Much untapped potential lies within the Sri Lankan Retail Industry and the SLRA’s aim through this forum is to draw out the potential, to explore new strategies, and to regenerate retail companies in Sri Lanka, in order to cater to the fast-paced, dynamic market, both in the region and globally. The Ceylon Chamber of Commerce partnered with the SLRA in support of this endeavor last year and continues to do so this year as well. The Sri Lanka Retail Forum 2018 will be held on October 17 and 18 at the Cinnamon Grand, Oak Room.
