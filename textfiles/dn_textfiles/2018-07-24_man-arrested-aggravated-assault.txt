Man arrested for aggravated assault

A 63-year-old man in Mawanella had been arrested for the aggravated assault of a 33-year-old mother of three in the same neighbourhood, when she had rejected his advances for an illicit affair. The assailant had slashed the thigh of the victim and fled the scene along with her mobile phone, last Friday.
The victim had been subsequently admitted to the Mawanella Base Hospital. Police had later arrested the suspect and produced him at the Mawanella Magistrate’s Court. The magistrate had ordered the suspect to be remanded. Investigations are continuing.
