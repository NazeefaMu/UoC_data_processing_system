SLIM, the first and longest-serving CIM study centre in the country accredited by CIM UK, recently held an Inauguration ceremony for the first CIM intake for 2018. The event was held at the SLIM headquarters, which is also referred to as ‘SLIM HOME’. SLIM has consistently emphasized the importance of quality Marketing education and its students continue to showcase talent, skills, ability and knowledge gained through education at SLIM.
The event was held to build awareness about the CIM coaching sessions at SLIM and to take the students through the process from beginner to advanced levels of the CIM educational path. To further enrich the product, SLIM will also provide a book for each stage for reference purposes. Those present at the occasion were Advanced Level students, young executives interested in a Marketing career and even non-Marketers, who showed an interest in the field of Marketing.
The Inauguration was presided over by the senior management from both institutes. Pradeep Edward, Vice President - SLIM and CEO of Lanka Hospitals Diagnostics, said that SLIM, as the National Body for Marketing has its core value of being responsible for the qualifications granted by the Institute. “SLIM has a wide range of members, consisting of top level marketing professionals. We also have networking events providing an opportunity for students who are SLIM student members to participate and gain exposure from senior marketers in the field, build a network with, and be inspired by them,” he stated.
CIM Sri Lanka Head of Education Rajiv David, and Senior Manager of Marketing at Union Bank of Colombo PLC also participated at the inaugural ceremony.
G.S. Sylvester, Senior Lecturer at SLIM, Marketing Consultant, Trainer, Tutor, and Chairman of the SLIM Education Reforms Committee, briefed the gathering on the programme structure. “SLIM is the only centre where a student has obtained 100 marks for a subject, which is a remarkable feat,” he expressed.
