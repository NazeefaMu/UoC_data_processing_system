SAARC for unity in diversity

The Saundaryabhimani Art Festival, organised by the University of the Visual and Performing Arts, in collaboration with the SAARC Cultural Centre will take place from July 3 to 9 at the University Premises in Colombo, with the underlying theme of Unity within Diversity.
The SAARC Exhibition of paintings will showcase the artistic talents and creative vision of the representative from all the eight SAARC Member States: Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Maldives, Nepal, Pakistan and Sri Lanka.
It will be a representation of regional artistry, cultural exploration and creative diversity and will be a special and unique feature at the Saundaryabhimani Art Festival. The festival will encompass a myriad of traditional and contemporary Sri Lankan visual and performing arts and culture of dance, music, song, theatre and art.
