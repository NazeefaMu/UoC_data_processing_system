Neonatal Transport Project wins healthcare innovation award

The Neonatal Transport Project of Sri Lanka won the ‘Healthcare Innovation of the Year’ of the British Medical Journal (BMJ) South Asia Award 2107, a Health Ministry spokesman said.
He said 75 percent of infants die before five years. Another one-third underweight and premature babies die during the first month. Considering this, the Health Ministry introduced a safe transport mode for such vulnerable infants.
Medical officers and nurses with specialized training are appointed to carry out this service, which contributes immensely to reduce infant mortality. Sri Lanka records South Asia's lowest infant and maternal mortality rates at the moment, he said.
Health Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne instructed health officials to expand this service to other parts of the country soon.
The service is now available in Colombo, he added.
