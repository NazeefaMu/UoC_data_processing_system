Trailing Colombo for a different view

Colombo is growing bigger than ever and it’s becoming the hub for so many happening things. But with all these taking place people sometimes do forget that there is a calmer, serene, historical and archeological hub as well in this buzzing city. All one needs to is turn of their work mode and take a deep breath and take any mode of transportation and begin exploring sites away from tall buildings and the ocean front.
Taking into consideration that there is definitely more to Colombo than what meets the eye, Cinnamon City Hotels launched the Colombo City Excursions in collaboration with Nature Trails on Tuesday October 6. “We have three city hotels – Cinnamon Grand, Cinnamon Lakeside and Cinnamon Red – three different experiences and budgets too. There’s a need to showcase the scenic beauty of Colombo. We wanted to see how we could extend the stay of a city traveler and to ones who think there’s attraction only of the city”, Cinnamon Hotels and Resorts City Sector Marketing Communications Head Tharika Goonathilake stated at the press briefing.
Nature Trails which is the wildlife and adventure tourism arm of Cinnamon Resorts & Hotels is headed by Chitral Jayatilake, got together with his team and studied the time frames for each of the expeditions as well as on the budgets.

“Sometimes we feel that we have neglected the true essence of the city and lost interest in all that is worth looking at in the city. We thought that it is worth to get a bundle of offerings to explore in the city. Sometimes a few moments spent in nature, a place of worship or just talking to an interesting personality is all you need to get some stress away. Interpretations of these excursions will be handled by the team of experts from Nature Trails. We will be keeping on adding excursions as and when we need”, Chitral Jayatilake added.
“There are altogether six excursions that have been arranged. There is the Nature tour which is separated into two excursions – Bird Watching excursion to the Thalangama Lake and a River Cruise down Kelani River. The Thalangama Lake hosts a variety of birds (migratory birds can be found during the Novemmber-March period), insects and mammals and is one of Colombo’s best wetland habitats. The urban wetland is also one of the best places to spot the endemic purple faced leaf monkey. One can choose a three-hour long cruise on the Kelani River to the Historical Kelaniya Rajamaha Viharaya or a cruise along the Hamilton Canal up to the Negombo Lagoon”, Nature Trails City Guide with all the information Chandika stated.

The Architectural tour consists of visiting Colombo’s spectacular buildings, some of which have been erected in the Colonial era - the Old Parliament (1930), Galle Face Hotel (1864), Independence Square (1948), Race Course (1839), Dutch Hospital (1681), Town Hall (1927), Galle Face Green (1856), Old Colombo Light House (1829), Colombo Light House (1952), Grand Oriental Hotel (1870), Cargills building (1844) and the HSBC building.
The tour will shed light on design transformation that took place during the rule of the Dutch and the English plus a walk in Pettah - Colombo’s core commercial district – is also in the expedition.
Then there is the Religious and Historic tours organised to cover the historical and ethnic diversity of the country. One is a stopover at sites of religious worship of the four major religions practiced in Sri Lanka - visit to St. Anthony’s Shrine in Kochchikade, Red Mosque in Pettah, Kovil on Vauxhall Street, the Gangarama Temple and the Seema-Malakaya in Colombo 2. The other is a trip to the Bellanvila temple to admire the murals that decorate the Shrine Hall. The Shrine Hall has been a key attraction for the mural’s artist Somabandu Vidyapathi. He was 67 years when he took upon the work in 1990 and by the time he completed the murals in 1998 he was 75. His creativity can be seen in an area of 4,632 sq ft of walls. Adding to the historic value is the temple’s sacred Bodhi-tree, which is believed to be one of the 32 saplings that sprang from the sacred Bodhi-tree in Anuradhapura, which was planted in the 3rd century BC.
There are people who do prefer the indoors to the outdoors (no matter how much you push them to step out). So for them a little journey to the world of Sri Lankan Culinary works has been arranged. Sri Lanka’s rice and curry is loved world over for the careful play of fragrant spices to enhance flavour. Cinnamon Grand’s village in the city Nuga Gama serves authentic Sri Lankan cuisine from various parts of the country. The ‘food’ aspect of the expedition will be created here, with the ammés sharing their secrets of cooking with guests, giving them a one-of-a-kind introduction to local fare. A plant tour is also part of the package, where guests will be able to walk among the medicinal plants that are grown in the Nuga Gama compound and used for cooking.
Guests can choose any mode of transport – Three Wheels (tuk tuks), Vans, Cars or depending on the quest requirements or groups larger than 20, the special double-decker bus can be arranged as well. So next time remember to pack a little extra for that excursions – so that you are as comfortable as possible to enjoy Colombo in a very different view.
