Kelani Visura final electrical technicians workshop held in Hambantota

Kelani Cables PLC that produces the number one secure electrical and communication cable in Sri Lanka, held the final ‘Kelani Visura’ electrical technicians’ workshop for 2016 at Jade Green Hotel, Hambantota recently.

This noble Endeavour was initiated with the object of gearing electrical technicians scattered throughout the island with the latest techniques practiced in the sphere.
Kelani Visura workshop in Hambantota was lead by Sanjeewa Gunetilleke, sales Engineer, Kelani Cables PLC. The program hosted over 150 electrical technicians from the locality.
Here the participants were taught how to select wires with certified quality for the safety of houses and buildings, how to fix plug-points and switches taking into account the distance and nature of the house/building, criterions of selecting wires to suit the number of lamps, laying of wires and other relevant areas of crucial importance.
This comprehensive one-day workshop was inclusive of food and refreshments and was concluded with presentation of certificates and gifts to the participants.
