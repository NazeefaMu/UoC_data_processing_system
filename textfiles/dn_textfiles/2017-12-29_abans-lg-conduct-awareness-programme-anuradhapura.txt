Abans, LG conduct  awareness programme  in Anuradhapura

Abans and LG conducted a special chronic kidney disease awareness programme in December at Vehera Bandi Kutiya Raja Maha Viharaya, in Anuradhapura. The event reflects Abans’ ardent efforts towards raising our populace’s cognizance of the importance of drinking safe healthy water.
The event involved the set-up of a blood check-up lab where over 400 people received free blood tests for CKD and was performed by Dr. Chathura Senaratne and his team from the Army Hospital Anuradhapura, who also delivered a seminar on the causes and prevention of Chronic Kidney Disease.
Plus, individuals were able to bring over samples of their drinking water to a free mobile station and get them checked to determine whether these meet the safety standards for consumption.
Six LG Water Purifiers were donated to selected low-income families residing within that community, whilst one water purifier was presented to the temple where the occasion took place.
Jae Gwang, Manager, LG Electronics Korea and Buddhika Dharmawardena, Deputy Director, Abans , were in attendance at this noteworthy event as well.
LG, the LG True Water Purifier serves as the perfect solution to the issues centered around drinking impure water.
Outfitted with high-performance and progressive features, the LG True Water Purifier helps to purify water, eliminate all forms of foreign impurities and inhibit the chances of secondary contamination.
The most predominant function of the water purifier is the True RO Filtration system. Being powerful enough to extract impurities that are over 0.0001?min size, RO filtration eradicates contaminants such as arsenic, lead, calcium, sand and mud particles, pesticides, bacteria and more.
The purity and freshness of the water is further ensured with the Dual Protection Stainless Steel Tank. Featuring an airtight sealing cover, this tank protects your stored purified water from secondary contamination by insects and airborne pollutants.
Additionally, the unique EverFresh UV Cycle conserves and maintains the freshness of your drinking water through regular circulation and sterilization. This function uses a highly durable, long-lasting UVA LED Lamp to sterilize the water and eliminate bacteria and viral regrowth.
The UV Sterilizing Indicator encased within a stylish LED display also provides an inkling of specific stages of the EverFresh UV Cycle, and lets you know when it is safe to drink your stored water again.
