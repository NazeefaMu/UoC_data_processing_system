Housing loans for low income families in Tissamaharama

The government has paid its fullest attention to provide permanent solutions for the issues face by the general public, Housing and Construction Minister Sajith Premadasa said.
He said that no battle is more important than the battle of solving housing issues, eliminating poverty and uplifting the living standards of the people in this country and the government had dedicated to spend time, money and hard work to win that battle.
Minister Premadasa said that everyone is preparing for the battle of winning the upcoming election. But they have completely forgotten the battle of providing solutions for the issues faced by the ordinary people.
The Minister was participating at a ceremony of distributing housing aid valued at Rs 196.5 million for 1,174 beneficiaries of the Tissamaharama Divisional Secretariat Division in Hambantota.
Addressing the occasion, Minister Premadasa said that there are 80,000 families in the Hambantota district who have housing problems and measures will be taken to solve all these housing issues by 2020.
