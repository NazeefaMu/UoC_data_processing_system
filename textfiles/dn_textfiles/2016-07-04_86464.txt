Sri Lanka A get 299 against Pakistan A

LEICESTER: Sri Lanka A’s batting troubled by the right-arm fast-medium pace of Hasan Ali lost their last five wickets for 43 runs to be bowled out for 299 in their first innings on the opening day of their 4-day tour match against Pakistan A at Grace Road here on Sunday.
Hasan finished with figures of four for 63 off 17 overs as Sri Lanka A lost their grip from 256-5 as wickets tumbled at regular intervals.
Invited to bat first Sri Lanka A recovered from 46-2 through a third wicket stand of 104 between Mahela Udawatte who top scored with a stroke-filled 64 off 91 balls (11 fours) and Roshen Silva who made 48.
But apart from contributions of 33 and 45 from Minod Bhanuka and Sachith Pathirana respectively the rest of the batting could not contribute anything substantial to the total.
Scores: Sri Lanka A 299 (M Udawatte 64, R Silva 48, M Bhanuka 33, S Pathirana 45, Mir Hamza 2/51, Hasan Ali 4/63) v Pakistan A.
