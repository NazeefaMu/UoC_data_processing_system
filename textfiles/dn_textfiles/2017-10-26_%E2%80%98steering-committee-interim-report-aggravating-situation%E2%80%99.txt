‘Steering Committee interim report aggravating  situation’

Parliamentarian Ven. Athuraliye Rathana Thera yesterday charged that the proposals made in the interim report of the Steering Committee of the Constitutional Assembly are aggravating the situation instead of building reconciliation.
He said the proposals are completely contrary to the pledges made to the public by the Yahapalana government when it came to power.
He was speaking at a media conference held in Colombo organized by the National Council of Sri Lanka, with regard to the proposals made in the interim report of the Steering Committee of the Constitutional Assembly.
Ven Rathana Thera said these proposals will badly affect reconciliation and democracy. Even ordinary people belonging to minority groups do not agree with these proposals, he said.
"Introducing a new Constitution is not an urgent matter that the government should be addressing immediately. Before that, the government should fulfill the basic needs of the people," he said.
Only the people have the authority to form a State, not the government. Therefore, the Constitution making process should be based on the requirements of the public instead of the requirements of other countries.
The Steering Committee of the Constitutional Assembly claims that they have considered public views before drafting the proposals. If they did so they should have the ability to reveal how they did it. As those who played a key role in forming this government, they did not even consider our views on this, the Ven Thera charged.
By bringing this hot topic to the fore, the government is attempting to wipe all burning issues such as the SAITM and Central Bank Bond scam under the carpet.
University lecturer Dr. Suren Raghavan and Ceylon National Chamber of Industries (CNCI) former Chairman Tissa Seneviratne also addressed the occasion.
