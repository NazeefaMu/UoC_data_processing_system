Wandering elephant calf rescued

Kantale Wildlife officers yesterday morning found a one-and-a-half month-old female elephant which had lost her way, near the bank of the Janaranjana tank in Suripura, Kantale.
The elephant is about two-feet in height, Wildlife officers said.
They said they observed wounds throughout her body due to wild animal bites and brought the elephant calf to the Giritale Wildlife Veterinary Surgeon for treatment.
