Isipathana demolish Zahira 48-10

Singer ‘A’ Division inter-schools league rugby :
Isipathana College ran circles around hapless Zahira College Maradana where they eventually demolished them by 48 points (8 tries, 4 conversions) to 10 (2 tries) in their Singer ‘A’ Division inter-schools league rugby second round opening match played at Havelock Park yesterday.
The winners led 26-5 at half time.
The Pathana team dished out a superb brand of running rugby and gave a torrid time to the hapless Zahira outfit who were completely lost in a nutshell throughout the entire game.
Isipathana scored four tries through full back cum vice captain Chamod Fernando (two) and one each by scrum half Harith Bandara and winger Nadeesha Chaminda with Chamod converting three tries.
Zahira closed down the gap with a solitary try scored by Thuan Amath just before half time.
After the break Isipathana scored two more quick tries through Bandara and centre Manilka Ruberu as they went through the Zahira defence to score. Chamod missed both conversions but increased their score to 36-5 in favour of the Havelock Park school.
Zahira cut down the lead to 36-10 when prop forward Amjad crashed through for an unconverted try.
Pathana scored again this time through their second row forward Ravindu Anjula with Chamod making no mistake with the conversion to increase the tally to 43-10. Isipathana virtually sealed the match when centre Ruberu scored his second try of the match off a superb three quarter move. Fly half Kulasekara missed the difficult touchline conversion to take the final score to 48-10.

The Josephians wasted many chances of scoring and although they began the second half well with an early try it was Wesley who dominated proceedings from there onwards as they wrapped up the match with a penalty try in the dying minutes of the game.
