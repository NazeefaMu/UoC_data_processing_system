Measures to prevent diseases in Meethotamulla

All measures have been taken to prevent an outbreak of diseases in Meethotamulla following Friday’s collapse of the garbage mountain, Consultant Virologist of the Epidemiology Unit of the Health Ministry Dr. Samitha Ginige told the Daily News yesterday.
According to Dr. Ginige, steps have been taken to protect the displaced in the Meethotamulla tragedy who are now in welfare camps. They have been educated on personal hygiene. Steps have been taken to control flies and mosquitoes. Therefore, the risk of the spread of viral infections has been controlled.
Dr. Ginige pointed out that arrangements have also been made to offer antibiotics free of charge to all those who come into contact with contaminated muddy water in order to prevent rat fever (Leptospirosis). Doxycycline tablets had been given to the people who require them. All health services are offered to the victims as well as the people living in the affected areas to protect them from diseases. No disease outbreak has been reported from the affected areas so far, he added.
