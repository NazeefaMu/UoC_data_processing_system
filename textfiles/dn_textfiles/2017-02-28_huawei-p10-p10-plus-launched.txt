Huawei Consumer Business Group announced the launch of the new HuaweiP10 and P10+, innovative and stylish smartphones, co-engineered with Leica, which bring professional studio-like effects to enhance your portrait photography.
Through a special partnership with Pantone Color Institute, the world’s pre-eminent thought leader on colour, the devices are introduced in the latest on-trend colours, specially optimised for their unique Hyper Diamond-Cut finish.

The result of hours of careful craftsmanship and cross-collaboration between Huawei and Pantone Color Institute, both colour ways have been specially optimised for the surface and texture of the Huawei P10 and P10+ to deliver smartphones that areas beautiful to look at as they are to use.

To match this innovation inside, Huawei’s partnership with Pantone Color Institute ensures that the devices are equally as beautiful on the outside.”
Huawei has also partnered with Chinese designer Ricostru to develop a new aesthetic for a new collection of HUAWEI P10 and P10+ accessories.
The collection features the mini smartphone bag; the perfect partner for the new devices. Small but stylish, the bag fuses retro and oriental elements throughout weaving textures and a sculpted architectural aesthetic.
To ensure that your new Huawei smartphone never runs out of power in the most fashionable way possible, Ricostru also introduces a unique, fashionable bracelet that can quickly transform from a chic braided band, into a mobile phone charging cable.
