SLFP members should support President: Acting Chief Minister

All the SLFP members should rally round the President instead of showing their powers, Western Province Acting Chief Minister Gamini Thilakasiri said.
He was addressing a press briefing at the office of Western Province Chief Minister in Colombo.
The Acting C|hief Minister said the SLFP members should work on winning the 2020 election and to set up a SLFP government.
“We are not happy now being in a joint government,” But there is no any other alternative,” he said.
He said the SLFPers go to rallies of President Maithripala Sirisena or former President Mahinda Rajapaksa. Rallies would not help to predict the election results. The election rally in Polonnaruwa held by Mahinda Rajapaksa at the last elections was participated by a massive crowd but he was defeated, he said.
“President Sirisena would not take any decision inimical to the country,” Thilakasiri said. “The removal of Arjuna Mahendran from the Central Bank Governor position and taking the people's side at the lottery price issue were some examples," he said.
He said Mahinda Rajapaksa should assist the President instead of holding rallies to show off his powers.
The SLFP was able to muster only 95 seats while the UNP won 106 seats at the last election. Therefore, the SLFP joined the UNP to set up the government as they had no any other option, he said. If the previous government acted in right manner, the SLFP would not have been defeated. Dinesh Gunawardena, Bandula Gunawardane, and Wimal Weerawansa made statements that led to the defeat of the then SLFP government, he said.
The previous government had a Super Minister and it was Basil Rajapaksa. He acted on his own. When this government brought the Development (Special Provisions) Bill, they also attempted to introduce a super minister.
Government servants stage protests because they know that the country now has good governance government.
