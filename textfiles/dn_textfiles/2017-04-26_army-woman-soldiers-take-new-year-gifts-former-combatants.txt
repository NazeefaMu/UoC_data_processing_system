Army woman soldiers take New Year gifts to former combatants

A goodwill visit to female ex-combatants, resident in Chunnakam village in Jaffna was made by woman soldiers of the 7 Sri Lanka Army Women’s Corps (SLAWC) of the Security Force Headquarters - Jaffna (SFHQ-J) on account of the dawn of the New Year.
Carrying New Year gifts and sweet-meats for those rehabilitated women and their family members, the group of woman soldiers of the Army visited their homes and inquired into their well-being and other issues, if any with the intention of providing solutions.
During their interaction, woman soldiers exchanged views with their children and in some instances with their parents in order to identify their requirements. At the end of the friendly interaction, woman soldiers gave away those New Year gift parcels and sweet meats and wished them good luck for the New Year.
7 SLAWC woman soldiers are in the practice of regularly inquiring into their livelihood and other requirements, intending to further strengthen prevailing bonds of reconciliation and harmony.
