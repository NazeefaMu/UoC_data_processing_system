Making it a better place

Recycling waste is one of the best ways to create a nourishing environment for your garden. As most areas in the isle experience long, dry weather climates, gardening activity is at the minimum. The ideal thing to do is to set up a composting unit that will be a long term asset to your garden.
This is also the answer to the issue of waste management which Sri Lanka is facing in recent times. Devi Balika Vidyalaya, Colombo 8, is the first school in Sri Lanka to have zero solid waste in its premises. The school has launched the ‘Zero Waste’ project in which they collect the waste from their garden like dried up leaves and flowers and kitchen waste from the hostel. They use 100 percent natural ingrediants to make compost which they use to nurture their school garden. The left over are sealed in packets of 1 kg and 2 kg and are sold for Rs 70 and Rs 140 each.
The ‘Zero Waste’ project is the brainchild of the school Principal Pradeepa Samarasinghe. She developed the concept of making the school premises sans waste after the Meethotamulla garbage dump disaster occurred last year. Though the school has become a no polythene zone a few years back, they still had some waste to fill their bins for the Colombo Municipal Council to take away. Since the CMC refused to collect the garbage, they carried out a ‘garbage audit’ and found that its green environment alone generated about 50 to 60 kilograms of solid waste daily, in the form of fallen leaves.
After many experiments and attempts they got in touch with Anuradha Wijayawardhana, an expert in the Takakura Method of Composting. His work has won him many accolades including the JICA.
A team of 10 students from grade 12 and 13 involved in the Bio System Technology stream handle the ‘Zero Waste’ project today. They are guided by the teacher in charge Kanchana Weerakoon.
Speaking to Daily News TnC Chamodi Kaushalya of grade 13 said that the success of the project is due to a united effort.
“This was a new experience for us too. Everyone does their bit to make this project a success. We enjoy being involved in it because it is for a good cause,” she said.
Amasha Kushani too has been a part of Zero Waste from the start. She noted that the product is free of odour and leakage. Though the school chemical fertilizer in the garden earlier they are able to use their own home grown compost today.
“Any school or individual can engage in this as it involves only a few simple techniques and equipments. The initial cost might be a bit high but the end product is well worth it,” she said.
