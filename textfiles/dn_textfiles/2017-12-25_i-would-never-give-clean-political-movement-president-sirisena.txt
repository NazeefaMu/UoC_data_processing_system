I would never give up clean political movement: President Sirisena

President Maithripala Sirsiena said he would never give up his dedication towards a clean political movement, whatever challenges he may have to face along his path. Someone has to perform the duty of bequeathing a good political culture to the future generation as a national need, and he is certain that the multitude of people would rally round him when he has shouldered that mission of the era.
President Sirsiena said this when he addressed SLFP organisers at a meting held at the Janadhipati Mandiraya on December 22 afternoon.
Highlighting the need to strengthen the SLFP as a clean political movement in the country, the President said a political movement which loved the country could not be built without strengthening the SLFP. Within the SLFP, he needed ministers, MPs, and candidates who an make the party colourful rather than depending on the party to make themselves colourful.
President Sirisena, who pointed out that the forthcoming local council election cold not be won through the use of State power or financial or official straight, added that under the new system of election, it could only be won through knowledge and intelligence. Under the new system, what would matter in winning the election is the behaviour, character, and the public appeal of a candidate. As such, a set of cultured peoples' representatives who truly love the country would emerge victorious at the forthcoming local government elections.
The party's organisational activities and preparations for the local government election were discussed at length during the meeting which was also attended by a group of SLFP senior minister and MPs.
