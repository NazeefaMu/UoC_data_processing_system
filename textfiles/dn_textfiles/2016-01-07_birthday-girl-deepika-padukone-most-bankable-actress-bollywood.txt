Birthday girl Deepika Padukone is the most bankable actress in Bollywood

She has ruled 2015 and with 2016 starting Deepika plans to scale more heights. The box office queen has come a long way since she has debuted in 2007.
Eight years and 21 films down the line, Deepika Padukone has achieved a lot. She has delivered amazing performances in many films, won many awards, has been critically acclaimed many times and also been tagged as the top actress of the year for two years in a succession. And as she turns 30, she has now achieved the prestigious tag of being the most bankable actress from the present generation of actresses. We analyse her career graph and this is what our trade expert had to say!
Talking about how she has evolved as an actress, exhibitor and distributor, Akshaye Rathi mentioned, "I must admit that when she started off in Om Shanti Om, Chandni Chowk To China and Lafangey Parindey, going by the performances in a couple of films earlier down in her career, I never thought in my wildest imagination that she would become the actress and the star that she is.
If you see her performances, then and now, you see a mark and clear difference in the efforts she has taken to raise the standards of her performance. She has now brought it to a level where she is nothing but the best."
But it's just not about evolution, it is about her performance, her choice of films and her box office appeal too. Ranveer Singh's ladylove has delivered 10 hits from Race 2 (2013) to Bajirao Mastani (2015).
As Akshaye added, "In terms of performance, in terms of bankability, she is the actress currently. You have to give credit to her as she has become the best superstar amongst the ladies that we have in the industry currently.
There are a lot of people who are talented and there are a lot of people who work really hard and she is a combination of both. This is what makes her the true superstar that she is because every film that you see now, be it Yeh Jawaani Hai Deewani or a complete contrast film like a Bajirao Mastani, to a completely different zone like Race 2 to a Finding Fanny, in that sense if you her versatility and box office appeal, the combination is lethal.
If she continues to tap in to films like these, which are a fantastic balance of performance-driven films and box office appeal, I think she is going to maintain her position as the reigning superstar among the ladies!"
She has ruled 2015 and with 2016 starting Deepika plans to scale more heights. We wish her all the best and we hope that she continues her hit-run at the box office.
