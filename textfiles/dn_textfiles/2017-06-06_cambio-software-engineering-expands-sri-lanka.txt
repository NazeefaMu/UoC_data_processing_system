Cambio Software Engineering expands in Sri Lanka

Cambio Software Engineering Sri Lanka, the R&D Software Development center for Cambio Healthcare Systems in Sweden, recently moved its operations into two, new and larger, facilities based in Colombo 03.
The new facilities will allow the company to expand beyond their current size of 270 software engineers to almost 400 in the next two years.
Peter Cornelius, Head of R&D for Cambio Healthcare Systems AB, Sweden, arrived in Sri Lanka to open the new premises along with Sushena Ranatunga, Director of Cambio Software Engineering.
Speaking at the occasion Peter Cornelius said “Our Sri Lankan operations is vital to the success of Cambio.
We build our future and strategies on a scalable and reliable office here in Colombo. Opening a new office and allowing for growth and efficiency is good for everyone. Our employees need to be in an office where they can be creative and feel that they are part of a modern software company, I think this is exactly what we now have.“
The chief guests also unveiled Cambio Sri Lanka’s new logo, designed to strengthen Cambio Software Engineering presence in Sri Lanka as a leading Software Company.
Commenting on this, the General Manager of Cambio Software Engineering Dharshana Jayawardena said “Our future expansion will also require the best of Business Analysts, Software Developers and Quality Assurance/Test Engineers. Our new logo branding signifies change, for the next ten years of operation, in our quest to transform Cambio to create a world class software development work environment for Sri Lankan software engineers.”
Cambio has been in operation in Sri Lanka for the last 12 years, expanding gradually in numbers with the help of the best talent from leading Sri Lankan universities and the Industry.
The current expansion is driven by existing and new customer demands in Sweden, Denmark and the UK, where Cambio is one of Scandinavia’s leading suppliers of healthcare information systems and a growing player in the European market with over 100,000 healthcare professionals in general hospitals, university hospitals, specialist units and outpatient units.
Through the use of Cambio’s integrated solutions, their customers provide services to over 4 million patients in the Nordic regions and the UK.
