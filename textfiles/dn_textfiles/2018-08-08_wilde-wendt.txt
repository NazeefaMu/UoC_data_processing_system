WILD(E)  AT THE  WENDT

The night belonged to Oscar Wilde as he haunted the stage of Lionel Wendt when his presence was felt by most of us. Led by the impeccable dapper Danu Innaasithamby as the imploring Loro Goring in the IDEAL HUSBAND, every character was brilliantly portrayed, crisp, curt and knowledgeable that it was hard to pinpoint as to who stood out. Each and every character lived up professionally with mighty body language surpassing dialogue at certain points for sheer elaboration. Their interrelating to each other was smooth with a sense of understanding that I found no flow.
Expressions superseded veteran players of the past when this bunch of novices by adding youthful freshness. I have to be honest and say that Danu overshadowed all with his clear of his voice and dignified acting.
Naturally, the whole cast picked by Jith Pieris rose to the occasion. In the past I have seen a couple of plays and operas abroad like for instance, Phantom of the Opera and pondered how on earth Oscar Wilde be boarded on local theatre, was sceptical of the outcome, especially from novices.
Youthful brilliance
Lo and behind; what appeared before my eyes, sent shock waves. Never bargained for such sweet youthful brilliance. In Jith Pieris's hands, he had moulded, shaped from fresh clay to surface likes of Christopher Plummer, Rex Harrison, Maurice Chevalier and Audrey Hepburn etc.
Both plays were boarded in 1895. The Ideal Husband in January and The Importance of Being Earnest in February to a packed house at Haymarket Theatre and St. James Theatre in London and followed at the Lyceum in New York. Needless to say that the already shamed Oscar Wilde whose spirits were flagging, got the much-needed boost to his spirit after homosexual scandal.
Born in Dublin, Ireland on 16 October 1854 and died in Paris France on 30 November 1900, he was forty-six years old.
With his Victorian upbringing, Oscar rose fast and furious to become one of England iconic poets author playwright etc. Had his primary education at Portora Royal School, he majored at Trinity College (Dublin) and Magdalene College, Oxford.
Lifelong interest
Stood out brilliantly and ahead of his colleagues in journalism and dialogue. With Anglo- Irish intellectual parents, Oscar studied Greek literature, aesthetics, philosophy and the history of the Renaissance. Oscar though Protestant, retained a lifelong interest in Catholic theology and liturgy.
Unfortunately, his short life weighed him down with misery, unhappiness, litigation and finally shamed for homosexuality which he called upon himself by dragging the Marquess of Queensbury for prosecution for criminal libel. Marquess was the father of Oscar's lover, Lord Alfred Douglas. The trial unearthed evidence that caused Oscar to drop his charges and led to his own arrest. He was found guilty and was jailed for two years. He died a broken man shamed in his own country that held him on a pedestal-
Oscar Wilde's finest literary contribution among many was The Picture of Dorian Gray, Salome (in French), The Ideal Husband, The Importance of Being Earnest, De Profund (written while in prison) and his last work before he died The Ballad of Reading Goad'.
JITH PEIRIS
How an emotional English classic was turned into a hilarious play full of wit and humour is commendable. Very few will dare take the risk or for that matter, the challenge. He is our own brilliant impresario who has done it. Scripted surreptitiously as not to lose the essences of the two plays, he whipped courage to use body language and cheeky dialogue and sent the audience wild with laughter
Harmony and amity to everything around him, a gentleman par excellence, genial and winsome, bright and cheerful in everything he is involved in. He is much more an individual than many masters of their art. A man of humble character who makes his presence feel.
The effort he went through on the not-so-big stage, made to look impressively double its size with Victorian dressings and authentic furniture, each and every detail however minute as some were, gave the feeling of walking into a Victorian chamber. The characters stood out with ease in the surrounding blending in natural mannerisms.
Outside, the street lights dimly lit caught my imagination. I am sure many felt that way.
The Spirit of English autumn had gathered and rose towards the heavens.
