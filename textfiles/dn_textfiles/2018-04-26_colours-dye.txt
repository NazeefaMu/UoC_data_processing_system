Colours to dye for!

Hair colours seem to be getting funkier by the day. Celebrities and models have nailed the trend and wacky hair colours like blue, yellow and burgundy have become a style statement for youth today. Here are some must-knows before you set about colouring your mane.
Exposing dyed hair to the sunlight
The sun bleaches and destroys the melanin in your hair giving you lighter hair. Since the hair is dead, the hair will stay that colour until new hair comes in.
Bleach and scalp irritation
The ingredients used in bleaching hair are harsh on the scalp. Transforming hair from dark to light requires a strong solution, and this can irritate the scalp if the solution is left on the hair for too long.
Colouring your entire head during touch ups
It is not necessary to colour your entire head when you visit the salon for touch ups. Once a full head has been done it is only necessary to get the regrowth done which is know as a root touch up.
Going back to one’s natural hair colour
A bleach wash is traditionally done with a low peroxide and hair bleach mixed with shampoo if you wish to go back to your natural hair colour. You should wash your hair gently and this will cause a slight lift in the hair colour. It is gentler than any other method to get the colour out of your hair - unless you can get your hands on a colour remover. A colour remover shrinks the artificial colour molecule down and allows you to wash most of it out of your hair.
Bleaching hair
Bleach is used to lighten hair. The bleach reacts with the melanin in the hair, removing the colour in an irreversible chemical reaction. The peroxide is used in an alkaline solution, which opens the hair shaft to allow the peroxide to react with the melanin.
Using a toner
Toners are a deposit colour, which means they won't do anything to your natural hair. They last for about four to five weeks depending on how often you wash your hair . If you wash your hair every day, expect your toner to fade out faster.
Longevity of hair dyes
In general, permanent colour will remain on your hair until your hair grows, exposing the roots. Usually, this takes between four and six weeks before you need to go back and get your roots done. The four to six week period is also when the permanent color will begin to fade.
Vegetable hair dyes
Nowadays, hair products like dyes and colours seem to be filled with chemicals that give you great colour, but also cause serious damage to your hair. Consider vegetable hair dyes. They are much safer as they do not contain chemicals and other toxic substances that do not do any good to your tresses. They are especially excellent for people who are allergic to various chemicals. However vegetable hair dyes do tend to fade after about three weeks.

Guidelines to protect your hair colours and make them last longer
Wash your hair less often. Shampooing your hair every day can not only strip away its natural oils but the colour as well.
Use a shampoo for colour-treated hair. When you do wash your hair, it’s important to use the right product.
Use a conditioner for colour-treated hair. Just as you should use a shampoo for colour-treated hair, it’s important to use a conditioner designed to preserve colour.
When you do heat style, always apply a heat protectant product first. It will coat your hair so the heat doesn’t dry out your hair too much.
Natural hair dyes
l Coffee: Coffee works great if you are looking to go darker, cover gray hairs, or add dimension to dark tresses. Brew a cup of strong coffee. Apply on clean hair and allow it to sit for about an hour. If you use apple cider vinegar to rinse it, it will help the colour last longer.
l Tea: Like coffee, black tea can help you go darker, and can also help cover gray hairs. Use the tea to dye your hair in the same process you did for the coffee.
l Beet and carrot juice: This one is easy. Simply apply about a cup of the juice to your hair. You can also mix in some coconut oil to condition hair at the same time. Work it through, wrap hair, and leave on for at least an hour.
