Excel in dubbing

The dubbing unit of the Sri Lanka Rupavahini Corporation (SLRC) is the heart and soul of the dubbing revolution in Sri Lanka that started with the pioneering efforts of renowned director Titus Thotawatta.
Today, the dubbing industry in Sri Lanka has reached remarkable heights. Most of the credit for this achievement should go to Athula Ransirilal, who worked very closely with Thotawatta for 17 years.
With 34 years of dubbing and subtitling experience under his belt, he now heads the Dubbing Section of SLRC as its Director. The unit has won many awards under his able guidance and direction.
A versatile artiste, Ransirilal is an award-winning lyricist, screenwriter and producer. He has authored a Sinhala book encapsulating his long experience in the dubbing industry titled ‘Handa Kevim Kalawa’ (The Art of Dubbing), which was launched at the SLRC premises recently.
This is the first-ever academic book on the subject of dubbing in Sri Lanka available in Sinhalese. The book will be a valuable guide not only to students in the television industry but also for anyone interested in television. It will provide advice on how to become a dubbing artiste, director, screenwriter and announcer while also focusing on succeeding at the workplace, regardless of one’s job. The book is a Sadeepa Publication. Another book titled “Salalihini Ransara”, a compilation of articles written in appreciation of the services rendered by Ransirilal by his student Rasadari Pieris and several others will also be launched at the same event. A DVD containing his songs will also be released.
