“This is a ground-breaking concept for Sri Lanka, but one that has been quite successful in other parts of the world,” Ceylinco Life Managing Director and CEO R. Renganathan told journalists hosted to a tour of the facility just days after it opened for public viewing. “La Serena caters to a segment that is looking for the perfect mix of privacy and companionship in an extremely convenient environment that facilitates an active and healthy retirement.”
As a wholly-owned subsidiary of Ceylinco Life, the managing company Serene Resorts Limited has the benefit of the strength and expertise of the country’s biggest and most successful life insurance company, and is intended to be the forerunner of further investments in retirement living, Renganathan disclosed. Every residential unit is fully furnished with living room, dining room and bedroom furniture, LED TV, refrigerator, induction cooker, microwave oven, electric kettle, telephone, ceiling fans and safe deposit box. All units have air-conditioning.
Available at a daily rental for short stays of two weeks to one month or at a monthly rental for stays of a year or more.
“We see this retirement resort catering to the needs of several customer segments,” Renganathan said. “La Serena could also be a solution for children seeking a secure, managed environment for parents, without the stigma associated with elders’ homes. Older people visiting family or friends in Sri Lanka will also find our short term rentals a great alternative to staying in a hotel.”
