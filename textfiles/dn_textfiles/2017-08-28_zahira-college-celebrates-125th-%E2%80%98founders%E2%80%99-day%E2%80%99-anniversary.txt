Zahira College celebrates 125th ‘Founders’ Day’ anniversary

The historical process of establishing Christian, Buddhist, Hindu and Muslim schools over the past 150 years undoubtedly played a major role in uplifting our communities educationally. The standards introduced by American and British missionary schools upgraded the quality of life of all Sri Lankans.
“We are no doubt are appreciative of these colonial time rewards,” said President’s Counsel M. M. Zuhair, an old boy of the Zahira College, making the key note address at the 125th anniversary of the ‘Founders’ Day’ of Zahira College at the College Ghaffoor Hall on August 21. A large and representative gathering of old boys and parents attended the event. The Chairman of the Board of Governors Fouzul Hameed presided.
Speaking further, former Parliamentarian Zuhair queried, “Did this colonial process also result in undue divisions and excessive communal compartmentalization amongst us Sri Lankans? Did it also damage even partially, the prospects of establishing healthy co-existence among the different communities and unity amidst diversity? Did this process together with other factors also contribute negatively towards advancing the Sri Lankan identity and national integration? Did this communal divide at the schools level unwittingly contribute to a series of ethnic oriented conflicts and religious confrontations that post-independent Sri Lanka had undergone at regular intervals?”
He said the need for reconciliation mechanisms in the country appears to be also due to a century and a half of this compartmentalization. There are also those who argue that the British policy of ‘divide and rule,’ led to the present ethnically divisive and at times confrontational politics in our country. The British may have had their own good reasons for their puckish policy of ‘divide and rule,’ but what reasons does independent Sri Lanka have to hang on to this poisonous snake for nearly 70 years since independence?
“There are experts in this field who need to find answers to these questions. They must assess the changing roles that are being expected from our schools and the universities. All I wish to say is that the present school system ought not to be changed overnight. There must be due consultation with all stakeholders before major changes to the existing character of the schools are effected,” he added.
Zahira College had always accommodated a recognizable percentage of students from the Sinhala and Tamil communities. During the stewardship of A. M. A. Azeez as Principal of the 138 Zahirians who entered the Faculties of the then Ceylon University, 37 were Sinhalese, while 21 were Tamils. Fifty eight or 80 percent were Muslims. Like Zahira College, there are other schools which also accommodate a fair number of students from other communities. But there are also leading national-level schools which accommodate students virtually from a single ethno-religious group only. Such practices violate fundamental rights. These indeed require political decisions to pave way for reasonable integration, while respecting diversity, Zuhair said.
Ethnic and religious co-existence must begin from classrooms. Respect for other beliefs and cultures must echo from all schools, particularly from the level of the teachers and the school environment. When I spoke at Ananda College recently, I urged the Anandians to lead the country in uniting the people as Sri Lankans if the nation is to progress economically and free itself from external economic bondage. Our duty is to create a friendly environment for sustainable security for every child. We need to overcome the forces that seek to divide us. Today, I am urging the Zahirians to build closer rapport with Buddhist, Hindu, Christian and Catholic schools in the neighbourhood, in the fields of sports and literary activities and overcome the excessive compartmentalization, he added.
Principal of Zahira College Trizviiy Marikkar, Vice Principals A. M. Mihlar and M. T. A. Rauf also spoke at the 125th anniversary celebrations.
