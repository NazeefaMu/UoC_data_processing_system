Gulf Air selects Recaro to supply Economy Class seats

Gulf Air, the Kingdom of Bahrain’s national carrier, has appointed German aircraft manufacturer Recaro Aircraft Seating to supply Recaro CL3710 economy class aircraft seats for the airline’s 10 new Boeing 787-9 aircraft and 29 Airbus 320/321neo aircraft.
The contract, which is valued at over 35 million euros, was signed at this year’s Aircraft Interiors Expo in Hamburg. “Gulf Air guests rightly expect an exceptional level of service and quality on board our aircraft – and as we expand and modernise our fleet, Recaro’s economy class seats fit perfectly into our new cabin concept, guaranteeing a pleasant travel experience for our passengers and standardising our product across our short and long-haul fleet,” said Maher Salman Al Musallam, Gulf Air Chief Executive Officer.
Since 2009, Gulf Air has deployed Recaro seats on the airline’s short-haul routes in both economy and business / Falcon Gold class. Gulf Air’s incoming fleet is composed of Boeing 787-9 Dreamliners, Airbus A321neo and Airbus A320neo aircraft, and the airline is committed to ongoing investment in its product and service offering. Reliability, design and comfort played an important role in Gulf Air once again opting for Recaro as seat supplier.
The CL3710 stands for quality, exceptional design and comfort on long-haul flights. The multi-award-winning “made by Recaro” economy class seat uniquely features a flexible and individually adjustable headrest, state-of-the-art IFE systems and extra legroom for passengers. Its modular lightweight construction also offers a great variety of options to aircraft manufacturers and airlines.
“We are honored by the confidence Gulf Air has placed in us,” said Dr. Mark Hiller, Chief Executive Officer and Shareholder, Recaro Aircraft Seating. “And we are delighted to continue our collaboration with our highly successful CL3710 seat.”Gulf Air’s first Boeing 787-9 Dreamliner and Airbus 320neo deliveries are scheduled for 2018 and the airline’s A321neo aircraft delivery will start in 2020.
