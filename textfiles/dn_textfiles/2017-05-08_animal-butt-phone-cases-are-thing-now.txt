Animal butt phone cases are a thing now

Corgi butts are one of those bizarre things that drives the internet crazy. Luckily for their fans, Chinese artist Miko Ho is creating adorable phone cases that focus on just that - round and fluffy Corgi butts.
Her silicone soft cases are available on Etsy and each one is decorated with handmade felted rear-ends of animals. Pandas, cats, zebras and other animals, appear in the collection, butt Corgis are definitely the stars of the series. Miko uses 100 percent Australian wool felt for her designs, however she also warns that they’re not washable. They cost about $35 and will easily allow people to publicly display their affection for puffy bottoms.
