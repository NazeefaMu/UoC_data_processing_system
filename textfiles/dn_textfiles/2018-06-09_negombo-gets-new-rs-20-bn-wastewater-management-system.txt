Negombo gets new Rs 20 bn wastewater management system

Work will soon commence on a major wastewater management system for Negombo, the first of its kind in the area.
The Rs.20 billion project will take four years to build, and is funded with support from the European Union and the French Agency for Development.
Dignitaries from the donor agencies and officials from the Ministry of City Planning and Water Supply announced the project at a ceremonial launch at Negombo Beach on Friday.
“Sri Lanka is known as the Pearl of the Indian Ocean,” said AFD Country Director Martin Parent. But “there is a challenge in preserving its fragile coastal environment,” he added.
Wastewater management is key to conservation, he said, “and it is very rare around the world to see developing countries invest in this sector.”
National Water Supply and Drainage Board Chairman Alahudeen Ansar said the Negombo lagoon and coastline has been consistently polluted by municipal waste over time, largely the result of residents using individual septic systems, which can overflow.
The new project, which includes 70 km of pipeline and nine pumping stations, would serve about 75,000 people, he said.
“The European Union is committed to supporting international ocean governments, (and) lays emphasis on managing and using the world’s oceans and their resources in ways the keep our oceans healthy, productive, safe, secure and resilient,” said EU Embassador Tung-Lai Margue.
He said the EU contributed almost six million Euros to the project.
French Ambassador Jean-Marin Schuh said Sri Lanka was home to incredible biodiversity and marine resources, which needed to be conserved. “France has a lot to share with Sri Lanka,” he said. City Planning and Water Supply Minister Rauff Hakeem thanked the international agencies for their financial support.
“One of the main ideas in providing this infrastructure is to preserve our beautiful landscape and leave the water resources for the posterity of successive generations,” he said.
“Negombo lagoon and the ocean has progressively been subjected to heavy pollution because non-availability of proper a waste disposal system in this important city,” he added.
The new wastewater treatment system would not only help preserve marine resources, but also protect human health by securing safe drinking water and a clean environment, he argued.
He said several other cities were earmarked for wastewater systems, such as Galle and Unawatuna. “With the increased urbanization we are experiencing, we are faced with this challenge of our groundwater resources getting polluted and the beauty of the environment getting disturbed,” he said.
