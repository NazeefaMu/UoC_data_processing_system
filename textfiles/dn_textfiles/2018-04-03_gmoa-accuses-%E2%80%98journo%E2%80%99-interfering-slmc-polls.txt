GMOA accuses ‘journo’ of interfering in SLMC polls

A person call himself `a journalist' has made a request to the Health Minister to amend the Medical Ordinance to prevent members of the Government Medical Officers' Association (GMOA) from getting elected to the Sri Lanka Medical Council (SLMC) and to not hold the SLMC election until then, GMOA Secretary Dr. Haritha Aluthge said.
Addressing a press conference held at the GMOA headquarters in Colombo yesterday, he said that this `journalist' is among the persons who were upset after the GMOA members recorded a landslide victory during the previous SLMC election. This person is attached to a foreign NGO and acts according a specific agenda that destroys the entire free health service of the country.
The Medical Ordinance should not be amended according to the requirement of few unqualified and irrelevant persons with hidden agendas.
According to Dr. Aluthge, the other party who is upset is the Health Minister's Public Relations Officer (a doctor).
The latest move is trying to interfere in the SLMC (which is an independent body) through a journalist or using some other tactic. Past similar tactics implemented with the support of the SLMC President were defeated with the majority votes of the SLMC.
The GMOA hopes that the Health Minister will keep his promises made during the recent discussion and will not go against the decisions make by the majority of the SLMC.
Now four GMOA members are in the SLMC after getting elected with several thousands of votes, while others who contested received only few hundreds votes.
Election needs to be held soon for another few vacant seats in the SLMC, he added.
