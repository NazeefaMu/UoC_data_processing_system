The Pakistan High Commission and the Pakistani community based in Sri Lanka celebrated Pakistan Independence Day, yesterday.
Acting Pakistani High Commissioner Janbaz Khan hoisted the national flag at a ceremony held in the High Commission premises.
He read out the message of Pakistani President Mamnoon Hussain which stated: “Our forefathers waged a unique struggle and gave unparalleled sacrifices for achieving Pakistan. Now it is our responsibility to shape Pakistan according to the dreams of its founders and to achieve this objective there should be good relations, harmony and brotherhood among all strata of society.”
The Pakistani President had added: “The objective of developing the country and rekindling its glorious past can only be achieved if we work single-mindedly, keeping aside our personal interests.”
In his message, Pakistani Prime Minister Justice (Retd) Nasir-ul-Mulk said: “Undoubtedly, our beautiful country is blessed with every gift of the nature. From an ideal geo-strategic location to the most talented and progressive youth, we have all the ingredients to carve out our own destiny and rise as a successful nation of the world.”
The Prime Minister added: “Unswerving commitment to the ideals of the Quaid-e-Azam and following the principle of ‘Unity, Faith and Discipline’ would certainly help us overcome our present-day challenges and make Pakistan a self-reliant, economically vibrant and a prosperous country.”
On Pakistan-Sri Lanka relations, the Acting Pakistani High Commissioner said Pakistan had established diplomatic relations with Sri Lanka immediately after her independence in 1948. Since then relations, based on mutual understanding and common interest, have flourished continuously, he said.
