garbage dumping continues despite protests

Dumping of garbage in Muthurajawela area was a high level decision, said Wattala Divisional Secretary W.G Premalal.
Speaking to the Daily News yesterday he said that he was not properly informed of such a decision. Premalal further said that the Colombo Municipal Council was dumping garbage in a private land in that area.
Protests in Muthurajawela reserve continued for the third day yesterday as the CMC continued dumping of garbage despite public protests.
The protesters said that dumping of garbage continued with the permission of the government authorities.
They said that the land is a part of Muthurajawela wetlands and it needs to be protected. Many protests were staged over Colombo’s garbage crisis over the past few days.
At Nugape off Wattala (Muthurajawela), residents started a strong protest on Saturday (22) to prevent dumping of garbage in a 35 acre private land in the area.
Despite several attempts made by Daily News to contact Chairman of CMC V.K Anura for a comment, he was not available for comment.
