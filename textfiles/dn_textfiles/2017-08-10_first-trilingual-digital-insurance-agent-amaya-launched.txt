First trilingual digital insurance agent 'Amaya' launched

Saveyourmonkey.com, Sri Lanka's pioneering Insurtech startup which began operations earlier this year, announced their official launch following the trilingual launch of Sri Lanka's first Digital Insurance Agent, ‘Amaya'.
The startup aims to change the traditional perception of procuring an insurance policy as being a tedious legal obligation via digitalization, and tested its’ platform and new ideas such as ‘Amaya’ in the market following the soft launch in February this year.
‘Amaya’, the innovative brainchild of the Save Your Monkey team, was initially developed in English and is the first of its kind insurance chatbot in the South Asian Region. ‘Amaya’ is a fun and easy way for customers to choose their insurance policy online and became immensely popular among users over the last few months while still at its testing stage.
Save Your Monkey predicts rapid digitalization of the insurance industry in near future.
Following this wide spread interest, the saveyourmonkey.com team jumped to action and worked to launch the ‘Amaya’ in all three languages to make it relevant and accessible to all Sri Lankans.
Speaking on the official launch of saveyourmonkey.com and the latest development with ‘Amaya’, Chathura Jayatissa, Founder and CEO of saveyourmonkey.com said, ‘'As we launch officially, we have made it our mission to change the public perception that procuring an insurance is a tedious task.
‘Amaya’ was designed using AI (Artificial Intelligence) components to respond to customer inquiries effectively and provide them with the best advice for their requirements. We named the chatbot ‘Amaya’ in order to make our customers feel at ease and to make them feel like they are chatting to a friend. With the AI components at work, ‘Amaya’ interacts with customers as an actual person and thus quickly became popular among our customers.'
‘Amaya’ is a first of its kind not only in Sri Lanka but also in the region. While the rest of the world has experienced rapid technological advancements in the insurance industry, things have been slow to progress in this part of the world.
‘'That's why we wanted to introduce the digital revolution to the insurance industry in Sri Lanka. Because of the tedious process of procuring and the confusion that always surrounds insurance, many tend to overlook the value and purpose of an insurance policy.
As ‘Amaya’ has already borne testimony, we are confident that our tech based solutions will introduce a more customer-centric and cost effective approach to the conventional insurance business. We are happy to be at the forefront of this change,'’ added Jayatissa.
Saveyoumonkey.com is the creation of three young entrepreneurs driven by a genuine passion to make an impact. With the clear vision of transforming Sri Lanka's insurance industry into a more technologically advanced and progressive industry, they have already introduced a number of new innovations and reveal that much more is in the pipeline.
Their Road Side Assistance App which is another first in the industry is one such product that is soon to be launched.
