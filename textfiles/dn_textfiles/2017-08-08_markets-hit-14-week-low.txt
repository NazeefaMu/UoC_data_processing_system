Point of view
Shares fell for the third consecutive week, ending at an ~14-week low as profit-taking on the back of tax policy concerns and initial corporate earnings weighed down the Index.
Concerns over the Inland Revenue Bill continued to dominate market sentiment, resulting in the Benchmark price index losing a cumulative of ~200 points over the past three weeks, and dragging down Y-T-D returns on ASPI to 5.4% (cf. 8.6% recorded three weeks ago).
Although average turnover levels hovered around LKR ~0.70Bn (+35 W-o-W) due to active participation by foreigners and resulted in high turnover levels on Tuesday (Rs.1.22Bn) and Wednesday (Rs.0.98Bn), average turnover levels tumbled to ~LKR 0.43Bn during the rest of the week.
Crossings meanwhile, amounted to 39% of total market turnover over the week, with active participation in conglomerate JKH (69% of crossings).
Foreign buyers meanwhile, remained net buyers for the 27th consecutive week, and although net inflows for the week remained broadly the same as last week (LKR 0.88Bn), YTD net inflows on the CSE amount to LKR 25.8Bn compared to a net outflow of LKR ~5.0Bn recorded during the same period last year.
Market momentum in the week ahead is likely to be influenced by remaining corporate earnings for the June Q1 2017.
CBSL holds policy rates steady for third time
The Central Bank left policy rates unchanged for the 3rd consecutive month this year, citing waning inflation levels and stronger global growth prospects.
The Monetary Authority noted that the domestic economy is expected to recover modestly over the remaining three quarters of 2017 amid the rebound in agriculture activity and the reinstatement of GSP+ to the EU.

The Central Bank also noted the positive developments in inflation, adding that inflation has moderated at a faster pace over the recent month despite supply-side disruptions on the back of floods in the month of May.
The Central Bank added that inflation is forecasted to ease further towards Q4’17 due to the tighter monetary policy stance maintained since end of 2015 and as the ‘one-off’ impacts (particularly from the VAT revisions) ease.
The Central Bank also noted that although private credit growth remained high over May and June, signs of deceleration exist although at a slow pace.
The Monetary Authority added though, that higher market interest rates should moderate this growth over the remained of the year and that the recent decline in G-Sec yields, should gradually transmit to other market interest rates in the next few month.
The Central Bank further noted that gross official reserves stood at US dollars 6.7 billion as at end July 2017 and that LKR depreciation (against the USD) so far this year has been 2.6%.
