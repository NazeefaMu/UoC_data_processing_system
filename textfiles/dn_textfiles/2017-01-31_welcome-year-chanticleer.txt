Welcome to the year of the chanticleer

Happy Lunar New Year! Friday January 28, was the Year of the Fire Rooster. The Chinese zodiac moves in a 12-year cycle, and those born in 1945, 1957, 1969, 1981, 1993 and 2005 are also known as Roosters.
I have never considered myself a fancy cock-of-the-walk by any standards. But my Chinese zodiac birth sign insists that I am. That is because I came squealing into this world in the Year of the Rooster. In Chinese astrology the animal signs assigned by year represent what others perceive you as being or how you present yourself.
My uncle Rory taught me all about chickens quite early in life. By the time I was able to lisp in baby talk I was aware that baby chickens were chicks. Also that female chickens were pullets until they’re old enough to lay eggs and become hens. Male chickens are called roosters, cocks or cockerels, depending on the country you’re in.
Much later I learned in life that a man with a roving eye for the opposite species was termed a rooster which sounded rather uncharitable in the Sinhala idiom, kukula. Conventional wisdom, not my own, had it that roosters only cock-a-doodle-doo in the mornings. That fallacy was dispelled soon enough when a whole flock of roosters consistently heralded false dawns with alarming crowing at midnight and even noon.
Another misconception was that they were generally gentle and kept to themselves. That too was a cockamamie myth that held no credence as far as some of the cocks I was acquainted with displayed positive naked aggression to anyone they suspected were interlopers.
A clutch of roosters on my grandfather’s suburban estate used to sneak up on me, charge and dig their talons into me. That is why I believe my entire concept of a living and let live policy changed dramatically overnight. I never knew the roosters were at my heels until I suddenly heard a flapping noise and they were attacking me with hackles up. The last time a gorgeously plumed bird named Rio attacked me I took my shoe off and flung it at him. It hit him right in the chest with a thump. But he came right back for more, neck feathers bristling with indignation.
I threw my other shoe at him but he still kept charging and trying to take me on in an aerial attack. Completely depleted of improvised ammunition of any kind my yells brought the cross fox terrier bitch Vixen to my rescue. She chased the cackling bully all over the lawn and pulled out some of his feathers for good measure.
Vixen looked kind of loveably dandy with some of the bird’s tail feathers sticking out of her mouth. From then on I never ventured into fighting cock territory without backup of my shadow dog. Rio and his aggressive clutch of cockerels soon began waddling off at top speed in the opposite direction whenever they saw me approaching.
Many Roosters crave love and intimacy. But for sure they are the most promiscuous creatures on earth. Their hormones kick in quite rapidly when in love. As a result, many of them often have numerous mating affairs. Romantic problems are often frequent in their life.
Another chicken myth that was exploded was the one that roosters leave female ducks alone. Wrong! It’s not always that birds of a feather flop together. Although Rio had an entire harem of hens to choose from he became obsessed with Daffy a female Muscovy duck. He simply could not keep his eyes off her, much to the chagrin of Daffy’s legal mate Donald the drake, who usually summoned her to the pond when Rio became overly romantic. That was a pretty good ploy because Rio appeared to be hydrophobic.
And naturally when it was observed that the big rooster had somehow managed to cover Daffy duck with lusty regularity Donald Drake must have felt cuckolded. And particularly so when egg-laying time came around. Well, even the most savvy breeder cannot rightfully determine a sire by examining an egg.
Despite my earlier experiences with aggressive cock-birds I soon realised that not all roosters display belligerent behaviour. Sure they may seem an odd choice for a pet but they can be extremely engaging, friendly and entertaining. .
When I was around eight I received a fuzzy black chick from my uncle Rory. It turned out to be quite a chic chick and began ranging the house and large garden. It was not difficult to hand-raise him. He turned out to be a bantam cockerel and I named him Bravo. The iridescent feathers of his green and red tail and wings against his black body shimmered with his cocky walk when he followed me around. As for Bravo, we may have been the cocks-of-the walk but although we did have our differences he deferred to me in the pecking order. His absences were constrained by his overwhelming passion for romancing the neighbouring free-ranging hens. Bravo was a plucky little fellow and displayed his fearlessness among the domesticated roosters, many of them twice his own weight. He may have been a Bantam but he would never hesitate when taking on the ruffled heavyweights.
People often commented that the pet bird had an uncanny resemblance to its little owner, or was it the other way around? They claimed we demonstrated the same feisty and insufferable characteristics. They stressed on the likeness of the swagger, the full-throated crowing, the cockscombs and the confrontational attitude. And never mind the wicked, insinuating hints of the bird’s personal pleasurable proclivities they predicted I would inherit in the future. I was not amused. After all, it was inconsequential cockamamie chicken talk and humour most fowl! But to my utter annoyance they never mentioned that he was as handsome and flamboyant as they come.
After all, going by the old parody of sticking feathers up where Yankee-Doodle stuck his does not make you a fire rooster. You have got to have flair. So all you kukula types out there simply shake a tail feather and start strutting your stuff. So, Chinese astrology doesn’t seem all that cockeyed as far as the positive aspects of your rooster personality are concerned. As for the negative viewpoint I would say it’s a whole lot of poppycock! You can be cocksure of that.
Happy Lunar New Year to all you kukulas out there! Welcome to the year of the Fire Rooster, and may all your dreams come true.
