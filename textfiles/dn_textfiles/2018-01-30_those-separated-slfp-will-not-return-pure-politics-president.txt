Those separated from SLFP will not return for pure politics: President

President Maithripala Sirisena asserted yesterday that the faction of the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) that set up another front to safeguard and free the thieves could not sit again with the SLFP for a pure political career.
He said he extended his invitation to all the 96 members of SLFP to join him for he surely knew they would not come to stand with him.
He was addressing a rally in Rikillagaskada yesterday.
The President said that despite the fact that some politicians attempt to achieve victory to continue with their corrupted career, he would drive his pure political campaign to victory.
He invited all the members in Parliament with clean political records to join him to build up a government devoid of corruption. President Sirisena stated that he had made arrangements for the SLFP to record a historic victory at the local government election although it suffered a loss at the 2015 Presidential Election and the General Election later.
He said that though 23 years had lapsed since the passage of the Commission To Investigate Allegations of Bribery or Corruption Act in 1994, only four cases had been filed and convicted on corruption counts.
The President pointed out that the telephone calls taken to the Judiciary from Temple Trees during the previous regime had been reasons for the low number of convictions. Without eradicating corruptions, the country will not have a future, the President said.
