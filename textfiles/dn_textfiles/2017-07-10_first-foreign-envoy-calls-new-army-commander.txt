First foreign envoy calls on new Army Commander

Outgoing Defence Attaché at the US Embassy in Sri Lanka Lieutenant Colonel Robert Knox Ross paid a courtesy call on new Commander of the Army Lieutenant General Mahesh Senanayake on July 7.
They exchanged views on sound, cordial relations and understanding and the ways the US can contribute to the training programmes in the Sri Lankan Security Forces. The Defence Attaché recalled his sentiments of special attachment to this country since he was born and baptized in Sri Lanka during the tenure of office of his father, a US envoy at the Colombo Embassy many years ago.
The outgoing emissary said he would extend the best of his support to increase more openings in US training modules for members of Sri Lankan armed forces in the future.
He thanked the Sri Lanka Army for hosting a recent group of US Cadet Officers on tour and reminded that such familiarization assignments for US trainees and other academic bodies would continue in time to come.
Lieutenant General Mahesh Senanayake told the Defence Attaché that the latter’s personal attachment has helped resolve many issues in an amicable manner, for which the Commander paid a tribute to him.
Lieutenant Colonel Robert Knox Ross is the first foreign delegate who called on the office of the new Commander of the Army Lieutenant General Mahesh Senanayake after the latter assumed office as the 22nd Commander of the Army.
Towards the end of the interaction, Lieutenant General Senanayake presented a memento to the guest as a gesture of goodwill and appreciation. Major General G. V Ravipriya, Director General Training and the Military Assistant were present.
