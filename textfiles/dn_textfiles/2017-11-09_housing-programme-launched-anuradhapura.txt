Housing programme launched in Anuradhapura

Anuradhapura Government Agent R. M. Wanninayake has launched a programme in the Anuradhapura district to provide new housing facilities to the homeless, low-income group of villagers residing in boundary villages.
The National Integration and Reconciliation Ministry and the Prison Reforms, Rehabilitation, Resettlement and Hindu Religious Affairs Ministry are patronizing the housing promotion project.
The programme is coordinated by District Planning Director Sugath Nayanananda. Nayanananda told the Daily News that the request intimated to the National Integration and Reconciliation Ministry to allocate 5,000 new houses out of the 50,000 housing package being donated to the North by the Indian government to those families who had undergone untold hardships during the past, where terrorism and war were prevailing.
The planning director further said that this request was answered with a positive response.
“We are planning to distribute these 5,000 houses to the needy families residing in the Mahavilachchiya, Nuwaragam Palatha (Central), Medawachchiya, Kebithigollewa, Padaviya, Horowpothana, Kahatagasdigiliya and Palugaswewa DS divisions situated along the boundary villages belt extending from Nochchiyagama to Habarana.
In addition to these, another batch of 85 new houses are to be offered to the low-income families in the Medawachchiya, Kebithigollewa, Padaviya, Horowpothana, and Maha Vilachchiya DS divisions, under the patronage of the National Integration and Reconciliation Ministry,” he added.
Construction of 10 houses have been completed in the Yakawewa, Thammenna Elawaka, Anekattiya and Periyakulama Grama Niladhari divisions in the Medawachchiya Divisional Secretariat jurisdiction.
Nayanananda said that the construction work of 47 houses have already been completed and that one house costs Rs. 800,000.
Under this housing programme, arrangements are in progress for commissioning 16 drinking water supply projects in the Kebithigollewa, Mahavilachchiya, Horowpothana, Padaviya and Medawachchiya areas.
