Criminals feast on killing: Mahinda

Criminals in the country feast on killing, causing great destruction while the Police Department is attempting to control them ineffectively, former President Mahinda Rajapaksa said.
He was addressing a daham hamuwa at the Punyawardenaramaya at Kanuketiya in Angunakolapelessa.
The former President said the country has now become a hell of revenge.
“The government is all out to take revenge from their opponents,” he said. The underground activities are rampant now. It is like that of LTTE era,” he said.
The former President said the LTTE massacred children and invaded villages. “The same is happening in the south today.
“The government should bear the responsibility for all these violent activities. Fear psychosis is reigning in the country, and the people live under threat,” he said.
