When the case was taken up yesterday, MP Jayaratne and his personal secretary, B. Dayawansa appeared before the court.
Due to the absence of the Retired Engineer of the Civil Aviation Authority Aberathna Wickramasinghe (first witness), the case was postponed. However,Colombo Chief Magistrate Ranga Dissanayake issued the notice on the first witness of this case to appear before the next hearing day.
Magistrate fixed further hearing for September 11.
