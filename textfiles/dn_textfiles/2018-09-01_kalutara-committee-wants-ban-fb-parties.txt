Kalutara Committee wants ban on FB parties

The Kalutara District Coordinating Committee meeting held on August 30 decided to suspend Face Book Musical Shows in Kalutara District hotels.
The Committee was presided by Ports and Shipping Minister Mahinda Samarasinghe with Kalutara District UNP Parliamentarian Lakshman Wijemanna, where all heads of government departments and Police officers participated.
When parties are to be held in hotels, the management should obtain permission from the Inspector General of Police and the Commissioner General of Excise, the Committee decided.
The hoteliers told the press that the Kalutara District Coordinating Committee is not a legal body to suspend parties held in hotels.
