President acted in Lanka’s best interest – Lord Naseby

Lord Naseby, Michael Morris Conservative Member of the House of Lords and former MP in the UK Parliament yesterday stated that it was not for foreigners to interpret the Sri Lankan Constitution and that he was sure that President Maithripala Sirisena, as the Executive acted in the best interest of the country.
“As far as I can see, nothing unconstitutional has happened. It is unusual, yes but we have had unusual things in the UK, we were supposed to have a five year fixed term but it was cut short,” he said in a video released on Twitter yesterday.
He condemned the action of a junior member of the UK Parliament, Hugo Swire for raising the issue of Sri Lanka in the UK Parliament.
“It is not up to a foreigner to decide whether it is constitutional or not. I am unhappy that a British junior minister stated that it was unconstitutional, that is not the role of UK Parliamentarians”.
“You have your own Constitution and we in the UK who take an interest in Sri Lanka of course want to help but I have been careful in my political career to not support any one party or do business with them.I suggest my colleagues do the same,” added Lord Naseby in his video.
