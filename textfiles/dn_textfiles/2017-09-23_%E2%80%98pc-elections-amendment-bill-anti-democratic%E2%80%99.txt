‘PC Elections Amendment Bill, anti-democratic’

The collective of election monitoring organisations yesterday said the Provincial Council Elections Amendment Bill passed in Parliament this week was anti-democratic and it aimed to delay the Provincial Council Elections.
Addressing the media yesterday at the Centre for Society and Religion (CSR), People's Action For Free and Fair Elections (PAFFREL), Executive Director Rohana Hettiarachchi said the aim of the act was something else.
"Its utmost purpose was to postpone Provincial Council elections. The Government was misleading the public and get their attention for the Act by marketing some points such as holding election on the same day and the increase of women's representation,” he said. The Government had earlier attempted to postpone election via the 20th amendment. But the Supreme Court has halted it. Then they selected this path to reach their goal, he said.
Campaign for Free and Fair Elections (CaFFE) Executive Director Keerthi Tennakoon said the procedure used to pass the Provincial Council Elections Amendment Bill is the first ever anti-constitutional attempt reported throughout the Parliament history of Sri Lanka.
He said all the Parliamentarians voted for the bill were responsible for future issues that come as result of passing the bill by breaching laws and traditions of the country.
Executive Director of the Transparency International Sri Lanka Asoka Obeyesekere said the passage of the bill is not an issue. "The most concerning issue is the process followed to pass the Bill," he said.
“All of us know about the challenges that the country faced with the 20th amendment bill. We do not have the system of post enactment judicial review. Therefore, we can only change an act before the pre-enactment judicial review.” He said. He said the Bill on the Provincial Councils Election Amendment was used to change the electoral system of the Provincial Councils.
"People would say this Government is the one that removed the process for urgent bill through the 19th amendment. We have to wait for the final Provincial Council Election Amendment Bill to know about the actual law. It illustrates that there is a big issue in governance and that the parliament functions and parliamentary process have a big issue.
National Polls Observation Centre (NPOC) National Organiser Rasanga Harischandra and Centre for Monitoring Election Violence (CMEV) National Coordinator Manjula Gajanayake spoke.
