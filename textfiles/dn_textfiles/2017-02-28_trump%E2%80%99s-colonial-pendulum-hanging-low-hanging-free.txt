Trump’s colonial pendulum hanging low hanging free

Why do we have a fixation over old colonial sartorial legacies, such as complete Western attire, that makes no sense for dressing in comfort in our tropical climate? It would certainly be a smart and sagacious accessory for cooler climes or for a more formal occasion such as a wedding or black tie dinners held in air-conditioned surroundings. Perhaps it’s time to examine our mindless adoption of this relic of western dress code. And yes, let’s talk about the necktie, that suffocating hangover from our colonial past.
Yes, I am at the end of my tether with all these boring formal accoutrements. So much so, in fact, that they make me feel suicidal. It’s only natural with so many frayed knots and a surfeit of tidy ropes waiting to be strung around my neck. Which brings me to the pertinent question, that you don’t have to be tongue-tied while answering.
Whoever swore allegiance to the necktie in a country where average summer temperatures are 38° Celsius plus, deserves to choke. Of course, necktie aficionados who are legion will essay a strangled cry. The tie, they will protest, is as much part of western attire as pants and shirts, and haven’t the latter been absorbed into the Sri Lankan wardrobe? Yes, but then we are all addicted to pants these days and feel vulnerable without them in public places.
But that was before politicos and their sycophants, no doubt, at first squirmed into sarongs and sherwani-like bat-winged tops to endear themselves to the masses, at a time when screeching nationalistic fervour rode the country like a tidal wave. But in the sweltering tropics, how intelligent is it to start the day by tying a noose around your neck and then allowing a woman to tighten it? There is an obvious catch to it.
A woman giving a man a tie hopes she’ll eventually be able to tie him up in nuptial knots. But even then he is almost certain to receive the tie she thinks he should be wearing. So it seems as if it’s curtains for all sensible dressers with the drapery running down their shirtfronts. I for one think it’s time to loosen the colonial ties or discard them altogether. Besides, neckties strangle clear thinking. Evidence of that is clearly endorsed by the fall of the British Empire.
Talk of the Lady High Executioners. The official Hangman appears to be hanging around cooling his heels. That is because we have ceased to be a swinging society as far as criminal elements are concerned. Necktie parties have been banned although capital punishment is legal in Sri Lanka. However, since June 23, 1976, there have been no executions, although death sentences were handed down continuously by the High and Supreme Courts for murder and drug trafficking convictions.
I must concede I was required to wear a tie often in my long career as journalist, impresario and university lecturer. But I could not quite get the hang of tying it. You ask me whether I could manage the perfect loop? I’m afraid knot. But I am no quitter and if at first I don’t succeed I tie and tie again. Then at the most inopportune moment the blasted phone decides to ring. I grab it with one hand while trying to loop the knot with the other. And I yell into the phone: “Sorry, you’ll have to ring later. I’m tied up at the moment.”
What I usually have trouble with is the end of the tie that hangs from the knot - the part in front that gets gradually wider. There seems to be some trick to getting the tie, after pulling it through whatever knot you’ve fashioned, so that the part directly below the knot has a symmetrical little dimple in the centre where the knot cinches it. I’ve even seen these beautifully sculpted visions that had two or even three dimples, again symmetrically placed. Breath-taking!
My own efforts, however, always produce a misplaced, off-to-one-side dimple, so that the tie won’t stay centred. As the day progresses the back part starts to peek around the corner as the front part shifts to one side. I complain it’s lop-sided and the family members say: “No leave it as it is. It matches your grin!”
But I am certain I am not the only one afflicted with this predicament. There are several far more powerful men who imagine they can run the world who make a mish-mash of tie knotting. There are style lessons tied up with Donald Trump’s ridiculously long necktie as well.
Unless you have been living under a rock, you know the US has just sworn in its 45th president. But this is not about that. Agreed that Trump’s ‘thali’ of troubles brimmeth over but there’s one problem that he could have solved by now but hasn’t. That is his ridiculously long necktie.
Sartorial experts claim that long neckties look sloppy and spoil the shape of the suit. In an article American style guru Patrick Grant asserts: ‘’Donald Trump’s preposterous crotch-skimming ties are a deliberate crime against fashion.’’ According to Grant, a man’s choice of neckwear says a lot about him. After all, it’s a very visible statement. Trump may be using his ties to send the message that “he’s different”, and not cut from the same mould. It’s his way of cocking a snook at sartorial rules – with his style modus operandi.
Can you break the style rules? If you are not Trump, then no! Then maybe still stick to the conventions. Like him or not President Trump is a unique personality and dresses up to reflect it. It’s a cultivated look. As the witty Mark Twain once said: “Clothes make the man. Naked people have little or no influence on society.”
Any man worth his Windsor knows that the end of the tie is supposed to hit right at the middle of your belt. And yet when Trump made his appearance with his wife at his side his tie was hanging a good three to four inches below his waistline. Definitely the type of territory to put him in danger of splash-back or something suggestively worse.
Ok then what is the right tie length to educate Trump on? The golden rule for tie wearing is that it should reach the belt buckle or the waistband of the trousers. Any shorter and you will look like a Cub Scout. Any longer and you are in danger of getting it stuck in your fly. Worse still is the physical danger of an accidental zipper accident while using the Executive loo.
