‘No interruption to projects launched by previous govt’

Unlike past governments, the government led by President Maithripala Sirisena has continued the development work launched by the previous regime towards successful completion, Fisheries and Aquatic Resources Development Minister and Mahaweli State Minister Mahinda Amaraweera said.
“In the past, governments elected to power had not only harassed and intimidated the supporters of the defeated party but also blocked or discontinued the good work accomplished by it,” he said.
The minister was addressing a meeting after launching several development projects under the Ministry’s ‘Wewak Samaga Gamak’ programme at Udukiriwila, Hambantota on July 9.
Amaraweera said as soon as President Sirisena assumed office, he directed his Cabinet of Ministers to ensure that all development projects launched by the previous regime continued to a finish without disruption. Accordingly, all five major development projects launched by the previous government continued without disruption.
Amaraweera said people are today reaping vast benefits as a result of the SLFP decision to form a consensus government with the UNP which was the other major party.
He said SLFP supporters in the Ampara district had fallen into a helpless situation as SLFP Parliamentarians in the district were only concerned about conducting protest campaigns instead of serving the people.
Amaraweera said the allegation made against him that he predicted the possible arrest of former Defence Secretary Gotabhaya Rajapaksa was a complete lie which was part of a conspiracy hatched by certain opponents to slander him. All this opposition and criticism against him began after the President made a special commendation of him and entrusted him with the additional Ministry of Mahaweli Development.
