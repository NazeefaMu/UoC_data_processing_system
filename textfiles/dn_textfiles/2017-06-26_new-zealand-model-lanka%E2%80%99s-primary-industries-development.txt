New Zealand model  for  Lanka’s primary  industries development

Primary Industries Minister Daya Gamage plans to emulate New Zealand’s Ministry of Primary Industries which contributes the most towards economic development of that country.
Addressing the Inco exhibition on Friday at the Sirimavo Bandaranaike Memorial Conference Hall in Colombo the minister said he would aim to adopt that particular model applied in New Zealand.
Gamage said Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe created the primary industries ministry with a view towards increasing Sri Lanka’s value added products. The number of international exhibitions is rapidly increasing and this is a wonderful opportunity for Sri Lankan entrepreneurs to learn and understand the international arena, he said.
“I also encourage them to use government-supported trade delegations to provide dollars earnings to our country.My ministry invites all local as well as foreign businesses interested in setting up manufacturing facilities and I am confident that in the years to come, with the extensive trade agreements Sri Lanka aims to have with India, China, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam as well as with the return of GSP+ giving us the access to a 700 million European market, the market for your products will be extensive globally.”
Gamage said he believed inco to become one of the best customer focused exhibitions in South Asia in the near future.
