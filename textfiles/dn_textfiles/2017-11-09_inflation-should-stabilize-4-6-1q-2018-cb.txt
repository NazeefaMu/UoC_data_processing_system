Inflation should stabilize  at 4-6% in 1Q 2018 - CB

Inflation which is at a high of 8.6% is expected to stabilize at 4-6%, Central Bank Governor Dr Indrajit Coomaraswamy said Tuesday. He said that apart from the adjustment for VAT and anticipated easing of supply-side disruptions in agriculture, today’s Budget may bring relief to consumers.
Although Sri Lanka’s rate of inflation, particularly headline inflation, is higher than anticipated, core inflation was at manageable levels, the Governor said. Headline inflation accelerated due to high food inflation, the Central Bank said.
Dr Coomaraswamy was speaking at the news conference to present the Central Bank’s seventh monetary policy review, at which the Bank opted to keep interest rates steady ahead of today’s Budget.
For September 2017, the year-on-year headline NCPI (National Consumer Price Index) was 8.6%. However, the core rate of year-on-year NCPI for September 2017 was 4.6%. The headline CCPI (Colombo Consumer Price Index) for September 2017 was 7.8%, while core inflation for the month stood at 6%.
Headline inflation is a measure of the total inflation within an economy, including commodities such as food and energy prices, which tend to be much more volatile and prone to inflationary spikes.
Core inflation is a measure which excludes transitory or temporary price volatility in commodities such as food items, energy products.
The Governor said that at the beginning of 2017, two peaks for inflation were anticipated – one around March and the next, at around this time of the year. But the rate of inflation was higher than predicted.
He said nevertheless, it was core inflation that reflected actual demand in the economy. It was demand-side pressures that that the Central Bank could address.
The peak in inflation was not due to demand-side pressure, but due to supply-side weather-related disruptions and tax adjustments, particularly VAT, which was enforced in November 2016. The country has seen three agricultural seasons hit by drought, while floods and consequent landslides in May 2017 hit the island’s Western, Sabaragamuwa, Southern and Central Provinces, further weakening agriculture output.
Dr Coomaraswamy said that since present inflation levels were caused by factors outside the influence of the Central Bank, tackling inflation with monetary policy measures was not appropriate.
However, if headline inflation persists at a high level for some time, that can get translated into rate pressure.
The Governor said that inflation therefore needs to be closely monitored for demand-side pressure. Dr Coomaraswamy was however hopeful of a drop in inflation for two reasons – in November 2017, the effects of VAT which came into effect in November 2016 would be reflected, while it was hoped that supply side disruption to agriculture would ease, with prevailing favourable weather conditions.
He said that if the government is able to maintain fiscal discipline and the Central Bank maintains good monetary policy, demand-side pressures on inflation can be controlled.
