‘Court case will let me reveal truth’

Minister Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe yesterday welcomed a decision by Frontline Socialist Party to file a case against him (Rajapakshe) on his recent remarks against Frontline involvement in ragging at universities.
The Minister said that filing a case against him will give him an opportunity to expose the misdeeds of the FSP in public.
Minister Rajapakshe was speaking at a press briefing at Nawala yesterday afternoon. Higher Education Minister Rajapakshe said he is even ready to pay lawyer’s fees for the FSP as he could then expose the doings of the FSP at the hearings. Rajapakshe alleged that some raggers are sexually harass students under the influence of drugs.
Minister Rajaakshe said 400 complaints have been lodged against ragging in the last year.
Minister Rajapakshe said that he is carrying out a study with regard to the effectiveness of the leadership programme conducted for students.
“I am having monthly discussions with University Vice Chancellors on this subject. Both plus and minus points in this programme. If the pros are larger than the cons, we will consider reviving the leadership programme,” he said.
