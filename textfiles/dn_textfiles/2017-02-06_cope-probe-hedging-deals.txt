COPE probe on hedging deals

The Committee on Public Enterprises (COPE) has decided to launch a full scale investigation into the oil price hedging deals of the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation (CPC) in 2007 which resulted in heavy losses to the state.
COPE Chairman Sunil Handunnetti told the Daily News yesterday, that a similar investigation as the Central Bank Treasury Bond transaction would be commenced on the much talked-about ‘hedging deals’.
He said the estimated loss incurred from oil hedging deals is Rs. 14 billion as of now. “The COPE asked the Petroleum Industries Ministry Secretary to submit a report to the Auditor General (AG) on the status of all investigations hitherto conducted into the hedging deals.
These include ministry level probes as well as CID and the Bribery Commission. The AG was asked to furnish an audit report to Parliament within a month after studying all these reports,” he said.
Handunnetti said the AG’s report in this regard is expected towards the end of this month. “Through the COPE investigation we will reveal the loss incurred from this controversial agreement and will recommend taking legal action against those responsible,” he said.
Handunnetti said former Central Bank Governor Ajith Nivard Cabraal and former Finance Ministry Secretary P.B. Jayasundara would be summoned before the COPE if they were identified as parties responsible for the controversial hedging deals as the investigation proceeds.
The CPC entered into oil price hedging deals with Standard Chartered Bank, Citi Bank, Deutsche Bank, People’s Bank and Commercial Bank in early 2007, and these later resulted in negative payoff for CPC when the oil market crashed.
