Gentlemen put to shame

The recent event of ball tampering by the captain of the team is indeed a disgrace to the country. The gentlemen's game introduced by the British provided recreation to the players and entertainment for the public.
With the increasing sponsorships and millions of rupees changing hands the game has been degraded. Politicians now rule the roost. Greed pervades the scene as rogues enter the arena. The worst effect is the shame inflicted on the country with the noble game reduced to disaster as the humbugs rule the roost.
The Cricket Board encroached by opportunists is controlled by a gang of rogues and their proxies who manipulate the Board. Due to the manipulators being politicians in power it is utilized to mask the wrong doings. Heavy money buys votes as cricket clubs and associations are organised by these crooks to cover up the misdeeds. In order to end these manipulations it is sad but necessary to take sterner action by withdrawing some of the perks and companies cutting down sponsorships. It will be unfortunate but now very necessary to set in motion strict regulations including that of imposing life bans on the players and officials who are proven guilty.
The country is undergoing severe strain and shame by acts of match fixing, ball tampering, pitch tampering and God knows what not. Sri Lankans will be scorned by the whole world and labelled as a bunch of crooks! Do we need such a label?
