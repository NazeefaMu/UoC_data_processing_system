The Chief Magistrate informed today that National Freedom Front Leader Wimal Weerawansa’s wife, Shashi Weerawansa’s passport and National Identity Card (NIC) were not missing but found within the room of court's production items.
The Chief Magistrate observed that the CID had made a statement to court relying on a message of Court Registrar that the general passport and National Identity Card belonging to the accused were not found in the locker, without being consulting the officer in charge of the production items.
 The case was fixed for further trial on June 22.
