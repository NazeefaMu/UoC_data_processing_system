Extension for Army Chief  of Staff

President Maithripala Sirisena has extended the service of Army Chief of Staff Maj. General Dampath Fernando. He was to retire on October 3.
Military Spokesman Brigadier Sumith Atapattu told Daily News that the duration of the extension had not been notified yet.
Even a guard of honour was held in his honour at the Kuruwita Gemunu Watch Headquarters.
It is customary for the Army Commander to recommend senior officers for the post and reportedly, he had recommended six senior officers to fill the post and sent the list to the President.
The President has made the decision to extend Maj. Gen. Fernando’s term, instead of appointing a new officer. Maj. General Dampath Fernando was appointed the 52nd Chief of Staff of the Army on March 27. He joined the Army as a Cadet Officer of the Gemunu Watch on April 27, 1983.
