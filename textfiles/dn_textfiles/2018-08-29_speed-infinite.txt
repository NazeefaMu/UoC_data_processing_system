It will be dirt, mud, heat and intensity. It will be hard fought and it will be unmerciful. The strongest will win and the victor will be glorified.

“The track has been specially designed to create a motor sport event that is competitive, enjoyable and makes it a thrilling experience for everyone involved. The terrain will really challenge the competitors and make them battle intensely in order to emerge triumphant. It will be wondrous to watch and the atmosphere will be electrifying. It will be motor sport at its best,” said Kathriarachchi.
The track is situated in the premises of the Sri Lanka School of Military Engineering which is the training school of the Sri Lankan Engineers regiment.
“The competition is open to non- army personnel which will create a very interesting exchange with the non- army personnel doing their best to outdo the soldiers in what promises to be a keenly contested event. The rules and regulations have been outlined by the 4wheel drivers club and the Sri Lanka Motorcycle Riders Association,” stated Kathriarachchi.
It is not just the locals who are aboard! There will be four foreign teams for this 4x4 event making this something rare and not to be missed. Seeing events like this is certainly a refreshing experience. The event will be full of blood, sweat and tears and victory will be sweet.

The competition will be not only for males but there will be female lionesses taking part as well. It is not only males who are interested, there is also a huge following amongst the women. When it comes to dirt, mud and the heat, women are equal opportunists.

It will be held on September 2. This is the eighth year with seven competitions held previously. The war was won by soldiers who laid their lives down for their country.
They left their families to fight for us and our freedom. We live the way we live now because of their selfless sacrifice.
We must never forget them. They fought in a cruel war, some of them losing their limbs. “Conferring to the Vision of the Sappers 4x4 Gympo 2018, the funds raised from this event will exclusively be used to develop the infrastructure of the Sri Lanka Army Corps of Engineers and for the wellbeing of the war heroes and their families,” added Kathriarachchi.
