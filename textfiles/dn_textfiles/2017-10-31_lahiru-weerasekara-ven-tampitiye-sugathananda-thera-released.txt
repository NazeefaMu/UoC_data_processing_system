Lahiru Weerasekara, Ven. Tampitiye Sugathananda Thera released

 
Inter University Students’ Federation (IUSF) convener Lahiru Weerasekara and Inter University Bhikkhu’s Federation convener Ven Tanpitiye Sugathananda Thera who were held in remand custody for allegedly violating a Court order were ordered to be released on bail.
They were ordered to be released on two sureties of Rs. 200,000 each by Colombo Fort Magistrate Lanka Jayaratne, today.  
Two suspects were held in remand custody for allegedly violating a Court order while engaged in a protest held in Colombo on October 10 demanding the government to abolish SAITM.
The suspects were ordered to adhere with bail conditions.
The Colpetty Police complained that several protestors including the suspects disregarded the Court Order and attempted to proceed towards Temple Trees despite the Court order being read to them.
The Court order urged them not to proceed with the procession causing disturbance to public peace and obstructing the regular traffic flow.
