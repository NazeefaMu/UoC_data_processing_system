Govt. has given free education for future prosperity of our children - President

The government has been strengthening free education over the past three-and-a-half years, since the future of the country depends on the prosperity of children, President Maithripala Sirisena said.
The President was speaking at the opening of an indoor stadium complex at Sirimavo Bandaranaike Vidyalaya, Colombo, yesterday.
Addressing the gathering, the President said that not only the future of the country, but also the future of people and of the world are linked with the future of children.
As a state policy, the present government has increasingly strengthened free education during the past three-and-a-half years, while providing equal opportunities for children to receive free education, the President said.
“No one can put a limit on education. Education which doesn’t have boundaries is the guiding light of the entire world,” President Sirisena said.
He said that investments in the fields of education and health will yield long-lasting results.
“Free education and free health facilities available in the country have created and produced iconic persons. All over the world, education has resulted in producing productive people. Sri Lanka is not an exception as the country’s free education and free health service have been creating experts,” he said.
Free health facilities have resulted in creating a healthy nation and free education has created an educated society. The country is on par with developed countries where the health sector is concerned, the President said.
The President further added that we are ahead in several fields in the world arena. Education and health sectors are among them. Sri Lanka has achieved tremendous progress in controlling the problem of illicit drugs and drug trafficking. As a result of the initiatives to eradicate the drug problem, Sri Lanka is among the two countries appreciated by the United Nations, President Sirisena said.
Unlike some other countries, it is illegal to smoke in public places in Sri Lanka. Besides, smoking in the public transport service is prohibited. In some developed countries, there is no spiritual development of the people, he said. “I believe that the Buddhist culture and Buddhist vision has resulted in the spiritual development of the Sri Lankan people”.
Excessive use of technological gadgets has become a threat to mental health, President Sirisena said. “With advancements in technology, people have become robots. Human qualities have come down,” he said.
