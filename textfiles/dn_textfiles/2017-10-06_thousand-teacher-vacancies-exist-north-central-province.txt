Thousand teacher  vacancies exist in North Central Province

 Anuradhapura Grads languish without employments
Over 1,000 teacher vacancies exist in the North Central Province and recently 488 graduates were recruited as Sinhala and Tamil medium teachers and another batch will be recruited taking into account the scores they have achieved at the competitive examination and the interviews, sources said.
The province has 15,901 teachers as at December 31, 2016 and 15,901 at July 12, 2017. The Province needs 16,830 teachers and the rest will be recruited following the accepted procedure, the sources said.
The Provincial Council has no provision to recruit graduates as development officers. But the NCP could accommodate 1,200 graduate trainees. Already 853 were recruited as trainees.
We are waiting for the approval of the Economic Policies and Planning Ministry and the Management Services Department to recruit more teachers. If the approval was given, it would resolve the graduates' unemployments, Bandara said.Recently, unemployed graduates in the province protested demanding the employments in the State sector and met the Agriculture Minister Duminda Dissanayake and discussed their issues.
They said they were discriminated at the recently held competitive examination and the interviews for the recruitment of provincial graduate teachers.
They said they met the Minister and discussed their issues and the injustice alleged to have been committed in the recruitment process at the Minister's Anuradhapura office.
They said Minister Duminda Dissanayake promised them that he would discuss the issue with the authorities and give them relief.
