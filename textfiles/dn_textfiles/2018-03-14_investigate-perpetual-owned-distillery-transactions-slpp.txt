Investigate Perpetual owned distillery transactions - SLPP

Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) Chairman Prof.G. L.Pieris said the Commission to Investigate Allegations of Bribery or Corruption should prioritise investigations into accounts of a distillery company owned by Perpetual Treasuries Limited.
He said Rs.1200 million has been deposited in a bank account of this company and money has been credited to the account on more than 50 occasions.
The commission should give priority to investigate this case, he said.
