SLIIT School of Architecture partners with Liverpool John Moores University, UK

SLIIT being rich in technological resources have established the new school of Architecture which brings together some of the most creative and experienced architects in the country to deliver an international standard programme with state of the art facilities at SLIIT.
The School of Architecture was established last year under the wings of the Faculty of Engineering and the able guidance of one of Sri Lanka’s most respected and experienced senior Architects; Prof. Nimal De Silva.
SLIIT is a great option for anyone who wishes to become an outstanding Architect who isboth creative and technologically on par with the rest of the world. SLIIT offers a comprehensive, technologically advanced international degree with a Sri Lankan flavor at a fully equipped multidisciplinary campus. International students and well qualified staff will further enrich the experience.
Presently the Degree offered at SLIIT School of Architecture is a B.Sc (Honors) Degree in Architecture from the Liverpool John Moores University in the UK. This international collaboration allows students to either obtain a UK degree directly from SLIIT or to transfer to UK in the final year to complete the degree there since The Liverpool John Moores University has validated the Architecture programme at SLIIT to be in par with their programme back in UK.
Intake numbers are limited for architecture due to individual and one-to-one guidance given to students. SLIIT offers a maximum of 50 seats per year for the Architecture programme.Students are carefully selected through an aptitude test. The minimum requirement for a student to be eligible to sit for the aptitude test is to have passed all three subjects for A-levels in one sitting.

The School promotes students to work on campus where peer learning and resources are available. Each student will have their own studio space to work on projects with 24 hour access. Students also have access to state of the art model making equipment such as lazer cutters and 3D printers where they can explore and experiment. During the programme, the faculty of Architecture will also organize field tours to places of architectural interest where students get to experience and feel for real the elements discussed in the classroom.
A student who studies Architecture at SLIIT, learns about the society, culture, nature, drawing techniques, communication, structural, electrical, mechanical systems and technology which combines with creative design to produce designs or works of Architecture which are for people to use and experience – making their lives better, happier and more comfortable.
Since SLIIT and Liverpool John Moores University are both members of the Association of Commonwealth Universities, a student obtaining a B.Sc. (Hons) Degree in Architecture from SLIIT has an opportunity to enter any state university in Sri Lanka to pursue postgraduate studies in related fields.
