Crossroad challenge

Sri Lanka at Crossroads: Geopolitical Challenges and National Interests by Professor Asanga Abeyagoonasekera, the Director General of Institute of National Security Studies Sri Lanka (INSSL), will be launched at the Lakshman Kadirgamar Institute on December 21 at 4 pm.
The launch will be followed by a panel discussion with the Participation of Sarath Amunugama, who is also the chief guest of the event, Emeritus Professor. Vini Vitharana, Professor Tissa Vitharana, Professor Swaran Singh (JNU, India) and Professor Eugene de Silva (Virginia Research Institute, USA.)
The book focuses on geopolitics, political landscape, foreign relations, peacebuilding and reconciliation, democracy and institution building and cyber security and foresight. The book discusses Sri Lanka's attempts to look outwards, as a strategically-positioned island nation with the potential to be a super connector in fast-developing Asia and carving out a place for itself in the international arena, while looking inwards, to recover and rebuild its potential, bruised by an era of colonial rule and nearly 30 years of a civil war, with two youth insurrections, simultaneously.
'This book examines these twin dimensions. First, how Sri Lanka is negotiating its international reach and the spheres of influence that extend from other Asian and world powers, and second, how the country is engaging in nation-building, from days of racial riots to ones of peace-building, reconciliation, more robust governance, and the development of cybersecurity. Written from the perspective of a Sri Lankan academic and the head of the national security think tank, this book offers insights into how the country has addressed its post-conflict as well as geopolitical challenges, navigated through domestic politics, and ramped up peace-building efforts, to now reach a junction where it can put its foot firmly on the road to prosperity in a new Asian world order,' a description of the book issued by the publisher said.
