Unpredictable CR shock Airmen 57-20

Unpredictable CR & FC went on the rampage to score eight tries and a penalty to ground high riding Air Force by 57 points to 20 in their first round Dialog ‘A’ Division inter-club league rugby match played at Longden Place yesterday.
CR ran riot against a totally different looking Air Force outfit their 57 points coming off 8 tries, 7 conversions and a penalty to 20 (2 tries, 2 conversions, 2 penalties). The winners led 31-6 at half time.
The Redshirts surprisingly got their act together and their momentum from the word ‘go’ for which the unfortunate Air Force had no answers. Compare to their last two outings, in this game they really looked like a different bunch of players who were completely lost in the wildness.
For CR winger Kavindu Perera, centre Tharinda Ratwatte scored two tries each and second row Dilanka Perera, scrum half Kavindu de Costa, second row Ishan Noor and number eight Omalka Gunaratne scored a try apiece. Ratwatte converted six of the tries and put over the penalty. Full back Prince Chamara also converted one try.
Winger Pabasara Hewage and Thilina Bandara scored one try apiece for the Airmen with centre Charith Seneviratne making the conversions and putting over two penalties.
Referee: Priyantha Gunaratna.
