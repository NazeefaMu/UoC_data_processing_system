Sri Lanka to  export bananas  to China

The Agriculture Ministry will sign an agreement with the Chinese Government to supply banana to the Chinese market, Agriculture Minister Mahinda Amaraweera said.
The Ministry will export high quality Ambul kesel (sour plantains), Rath kesel (red banana) and Kolikuttu to China under the agreement.
Agriculture Department sources said many varieties of bananas grow in Sri Lanka.
They are cultivated in large, medium, and small-scale orchards, and in home gardens.
“Around 29 varieties of bananas are available here and several of them are native to Sri Lanka,” the sources said.
Banana is widely cultivated and consumed in Sri Lanka. The Island produces over 450,000 metric tonnes of banana annually.
