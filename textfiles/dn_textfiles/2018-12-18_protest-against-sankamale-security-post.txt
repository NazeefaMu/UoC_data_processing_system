Protest against Sankamale security post

The public in the area have staged a protest against construction of the security post at the Sankamale Archaeological site at Thennamarawadi area in the Kuchchaveli Divisional Secretariat in Trincomalee.
They expressed their views against the construction being made by the Archaeological Department.
They said that the construction blocks the access way to their Kovil. Some people in the area are taking signatures of the public to hand over to the Kuchchaveli Divisional Secretariat. Through a letter, they also requested to provide them a viable solution to the issue.
Archaeological Department Trincomalee Additional Director W. M. A. Sumanadasa said that this area has been gazetted as an archaeological site. He added that the security post is constructed for a security guard for the protection of the same site.
‘It does not block any access way,’ he added.
