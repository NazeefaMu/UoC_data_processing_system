Favourite song, an untold story

Sihinayaki Re with lyricist Malini Jayaratne
Sihinayaki Re is a trendy television programme which has been telecasted on every Sunday night over the Sri Lanka Rupavahini channel for two hours until midnight. It has had a tremendous viewer enthusiasm and now it is reaching its 100th uninterrupted series program. The guest is predominantly a prominent personality, head of a government department, famous singer, actor or it could be a successful reputed business magnate.
The program is produced by Jayamini Illeperuma Gamlath and her team while the presenter is the skilled and accomplished Mahesh Nissanka, who via his ability to pierce into the hearts of the guest has made the Sihinayaki Re program spellbound and nail- biting. The guest has the option to choose his or her singer to sing the 10 songs that are chosen. The guest has to justify why he chose the song has to be clarified in between each song. It is pertinent to mention that a lot of spade work necessitates being geared up by the production team with the guest before the program as it is telecast ‘live’.
Owing to the incredible curiosity and enthusiasm of this program shown by viewers overseas the Sihinayaki Re was held for expatriates in Oman, London, Kingdom of Qatar and the USA.
Incredibly superlative
One of the keen followers of this program had been lyricist Malini Jayaratne, wife of popular singer T M Jayaratne. It is pertinent to mention her program has been acclaimed by viewers and pundits as one of the incredibly superlative ones. This is so as she had enlightened appropriately the motive for selecting the 10 songs for which she had explained every line of the related lyrics in each song with her extensive knowledge in her vernacular of the Sinhalese vocabulary.
She had selected a young duo Raveen Kanishka and Arosha Samaradiwakara to sing the songs chosen as they have musical talent in abundance having demonstrated via our television channels. The musical backing was headed by musician Susantha Madurapperuma.
At the start of the programme, Mahesh asked Malini Jayaratne whether to address her as Amma Sandaki as she is called by many as she had written the lyrics for the popular song sung by her husband TM Jayaratne, amma Sandaki mama lowe hiruya ridi, was recorded in 2012. She wished to remain as Malini the wife of innocent husband Tennakoon Mudiyanselage Jayaratne and as the mother of a son and a daughter but not as the lyricist as it was something she had achieved lately. To the question asked by Mahesh whether she encountered any complexity in choosing the songs, she said as in real life as she is able to choose correctly, hence it was not a hassle to her. Malini confided that after selecting the songs she had endeavoured to communicate with all the musicians, lyricists and singers to obtain permission for which all had consented.
Rated highly
The song she had selected initially was a Buddhist song principally as she is a staunch Buddhist. The song was nirvana swarna composed and sung by Sangeeth Nipun Visharada Sanath Nandasiri. The lyrics were by late Ajantha Ranasinghe. With her far-reaching knowledge in the Sinhala language, she was able to explain properly to Mahesh for selecting this song. Although there are many Buddhist songs sung only a few like this are sung to bless the Noble Triple Gem. For Malini, this is more a Buddhist stanza than a song. She was full of praise for Ajantha Ranasinghe for his lyrics and confessed that his songs are always at high ebb and rated highly on top.
The next song selected was the song was buddhanu bhavena also a Buddhist song sung and composed by Visharada Nanda Malini with lyrics by Professor Sunil Ariyaratne an acclaimed very versatile multifaceted journalist who has contributed many sensible lyrics to songs. Malini described him as a compassionate humanitarian. She explained the significance of some lines in the song. She said panegyric songs were sung in the ancient days only for Kings. But this has been sung by the ignorant people of this country. It invites the people in the country and provokes those ignorant people to light a lamp to brighten and bless the nation.
She quipped that there is only one Nanda Malini and no one could ever become another Nanda Malini. She describes legendary Nanda Malini as the Kiri Mawa of the nation’s natural song.
The next song chosen was amma nubai sung by Pandit Amaradewa to his own music composition for the lyrics of expert lyricist Professor Sunil Ariyaratne. Here too Malini was once more full of admiration for the Professor as he had depicted a factual image at a home without his own experience as a father. She explains the meaning of the lyrics unquestionably. The father - though he is the breadwinner - bestows all credit to the wife, the mother, who looks after the children, feeds them and executes all the supplementary behaviour in the house. Malini elaborates that this song she believes had been written absolutely for her as the lyrics are specifically that as she executes this precise temperament at home.
Bordering villages
Then she as her next song had chosen mathotin ena uthuru sulange sung by Deepika Priyadarshani, music composed by another giant maestro in the field Rohana Weerasinghe, lyrics by talented Mahinda Chandrasekera. This song according to Malini is the best song composed among the many songs that were sung during the period of the cruel ethnic war. She had first heard this song while travelling in a bus. She had been overwhelmed by the music initially. Later, she had interestingly listened to the lyrics. She explained why this song was selected by her. The lyrics explain adequately how the lives of people particularly in the bordering villages got shattered and the mockery of destruction and loss of lives that took place elsewhere. A little girl Saroja in a school in a bordering village listens to her teacher who says owing to the tremor of gun fire her letters have got distorted.
The teacher says to Saroja that she cannot say how many of your class friends would escape and return. In the event, the ethnic war continues she would not be able to complete the education and would have to take up domestic work in order to survive. For the appropriate lyrics, Deepika had sung the song with her bottomless voice magnificently.
The nest song chosen was sanda sumudui madu sisilai sung by Samitha and Athula Adikari for the lyrics by Malini herself to the musical composition of music prodigy Rohana Weerasinghe. What had prompted Malini to pen this song was to obey to a request of Samitha who was then expecting her son. She had called Malini saying Nanda and Samitha have a distant relationship to TM. It explains that we all treat our children like our eyes as they are the ones who give mothers the motherhood. It is pertinent to state Malini is a very clever narrator, she says walking with the son is a real pride not now but then.
However, she says that as Buddhist we should develop and grow our minds to relinquish the bonds with the children. Malini says the lyrics were so emotional and touching. Hence Samitha had not been able to do justice to her singing, had left the recording area several times before the final take. Mahesh quipped that he had not heard this song to which Malini said is a song that should be heard over our airwaves and it is the precise cause she selected it.
It is pertinent to cite that Malini Jayaratne as the guest in this Sihinayaki Re program had won the hearts of millions of viewers for a very triumphant manifestation and has been hailed and acclaimed by even participants who were guests subsequently. This program is worth viewing over and over again would anticipate those who possess the internet facility to view as there are a huge magnitude of essence to be learnt from the lyrics of the songs by expert lyricists enlightened very soundly with her diverse knowledge of the Sinhala vocabulary.
