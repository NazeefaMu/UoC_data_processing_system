All night pirith to bless flood affected people

An all night Pirith Chanting by over 1,000 Buddhist monks was held at the Independence Square to invoke blessings of Triple Gem on thousands of people who were affected by the recent disaster. Picture shows President Maithripala Sirisena inviting the Maha Sangha to commence the Pirith Changing by offering a tray of betel.
