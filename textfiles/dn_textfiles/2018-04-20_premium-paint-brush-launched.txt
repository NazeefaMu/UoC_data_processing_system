Premium Paint  Brush launched

Macksons recently launched a premium quality paint brush to the market, under the Company’s popular flagship brand, Multilac, offering consumers and painters alike the perfect finish to any paint job.
These world class brushes come in two styles, namely Multilac Gold and Multilac Deluxe. The brushes are meticulously crafted using a state of the art, fully automated Italian machinery and technology, the first of its kind in Sri Lanka. The Craftsmanship of the brush with its attention to detail delivers unsurpassed uniformity and quality, resulting in easy application and a smooth finish, without tell-tale brush marks.
Ismail Hussain, the COO of Macksons Paints Lanka, explained the unique benefits of the innovative brush. “As a paint manufacturer we realized that there was a need in the market for a superior quality brush, in order to meetvarious types of requirements of different types of painters, and we did a great deal of research, to identify the perfect brush, that meets the need to upgrade the Sri Lankan painter to a master craftsman. A brush that is suitable, for all surfaces, including wood as well as walls.
He further added “The Gold range is the premium quality brush, which uses only DupontTynex, solidround tapered filaments, with no mixing of any other types, ensuring optimum performance, and the Deluxe brush is manufactured using high quality near natural bristles, sourced globally from the best quality filament manufacturers. These filaments are directly imported from the USA, and are properly tipped and flagged to release the paint evenly and smoothly onto the surface with little to no effort.”
“All paint brushes are crafted using stainless steel ferules and the finest quality rubber wood handles. The agility, longer lifespan and versatility of the brush for application on any surface, truly makes it one of a kind. Our Multilac brushes have more filaments that ensure great paint pick up and smooth paint flow, so that the painter will be able to finish the job faster, with the least effort”
Ismail further explained. “The Macksons mantra of producing only environmental friendly products, that are safe to our consumers, is once again amply proven in putting this paint brush together, as every raw material is meticulously sourced without harming the wild life habitat and we do not use any animal hair. Furthermore the rubber used for our brush handles are also picked from aged rubber trees.”
