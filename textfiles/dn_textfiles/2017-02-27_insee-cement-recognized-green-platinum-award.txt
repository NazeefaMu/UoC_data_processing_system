INSEE Cement recognized with Green Platinum Award

At HarithaSihinaya 2017 for commitment to sustainability
As a strong advocate and practitioner of sustainable initiatives within the construction industry in Sri Lanka, INSEE Cement was lauded with the Green Platinum Award at HarithaSihinaya 2017, an educational and environmental exhibition organized by the North Western Provincial Council during February 12 – 14, 2017.
The award was presented by President Maithripala Sirisena, during the opening ceremony of the exhibition.
The North Western Provincial Council, the only provincial administrative body that has won at the National Energy Efficiency Awards, has focused heavily on energy savings and environmental best practices during the past few years.
With the North Western Provincial Energy Plan implemented in 2016, the provincial council then focused on reducing the carbon footprint across the geographical area under eight sectors, including construction, industrial, domestic and transportation.
The Exhibition was aimed at creating general public awareness and interest in sustainable initiatives and green energy under these eight sectors.
As one of the leading cement producers in the country contributing the construction sector, INSEE Cement invests in technology and expertise to reduce emission levels that result from different facets of the company’s operation, recording the lowest emissions in cement production in Sri Lanka.
These efforts also resulted in the production of Sri Lanka’s first cement brand to be awarded the Green Labeling Certification by the Green Building Council; Sanstha, produced with 7kg less CO2 emissions per bag.
The INSEE Innovation & Application (I&A) Center too, collaborates with all stakeholders including architects, engineers, contractors and researchers, introducing green concepts, sustainable concrete solutions, products and technologies.
In doing so, the INSEE I&A Center identifies better ways to build superior, high performance and sustainable living structures and infrastructure in Sri Lanka, realizing the country’s vision of transforming into a sustainable ecosystem.
The company operated a stall at the exhibition, showcasing their brands as well as sustainable practices and applications.
“INSEE Cement’s contribution to sustainable construction is twofold,” said Janaka Weerakoon, Director Commercial at INSEE. “One is to minimize environmental damage through optimization of process and product, and the second is through the dissemination of knowledge and information to a wider audience.
HarithaSihinaya 2017 proved to be one such platform where we could promote our brand, and reach out to a progressive demographic. We are proud to have been part of this exhibition as a Green Platinum Sponsor of the event.”
The exhibition ended on a hugely successful note, attracting large crowds, including students from across the province. Having reached out to the general public during this edition of the exhibition,The North Western Provincial Council hopes to attract the participation of the commercial sector for the next exhibition, proposed for 2018.
