First-ever Vesak pandol in New Delhi

A brightly - lit ‘Vesak’ pandol erected by the Sri Lanka Army’s Corps of Engineer Services (CES), following an initiative of Sri Lankan High Commissioner to India Chitranganee Wagiswara was opened in New Delhi on Monday.
This is to coincide with the commemoration of the Buddha’s Birth, Enlightenment and Parinibbana (Passing Away).
In addition, over 200 white Vesak lanterns and Vesak buckets will adorn New Delhi for the first time marking this significant event revered by Buddhists worldwide.
A team of one officer and 15 other rankers of the CES who left for India on May 2 with necessary paraphernalia for the task of erecting this novel pandol in New Delhi, began their creative project within a few hours closely coordinating with the Defence Adviser at the High Commission.
Sri Lanka Navy supported the project by coordinating the ferrying of the required materials, equipment and iron structures, etc to India.
The multi-coloured pandol in New Delhi that depicts the ‘Angulimala’ story is 40 feet in height and illuminated with 15,000 bulbs. A Hindi version of the story is played in the arrangement.
Considered the first-ever project of this nature in India in the recent past, the pandol after its ceremonial opening on Monday will be on display until May 21. According to a press release issued by the New Delhi-based Sri Lankan High Commission, Education Minister Akila Viraj Kariyawasam and Indian Union State Minister for Home Affairs Kiren Rijiju inaugurated the display of the pandol.
A number of state sector agencies of the Indian government including New Delhi Municipal Council have extended their support for this monumental gesture of veneration.
