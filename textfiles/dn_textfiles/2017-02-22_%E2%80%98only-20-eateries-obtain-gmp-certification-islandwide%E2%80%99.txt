‘Only 20 eateries obtain GMP certification islandwide’

Only 20 eating houses have obtained the Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP) process certification from the Sri Lanka Standards Institution (SLSI) although there are thousands of eating houses islandwide, Sri Lanka Standards Institution(SLSI) Senior Deputy Director Deepika Munaweera said.
Addressing a media briefing in Colombo yesterday, she said obtaining the GMP certificate was made compulsory for all eateries and catering services in the country with effect from January 1, 2017 in order to improve consumer food hygiene.
Unfortunately, none of welfare canteens in the state sector and over 6,000 school canteens islandwide have obtained the GMP certificate.
However,applications have been received only from 30 eating houses and catering services. But,according to the Gazette Notification issued on June 11,2015, no trader,caterer,supplier of processed food and/or any other person/persons shall engage in the business of mass catering and/or outdoor catering or other similar or connected activity/activities unless they obtain the GMP from the Sri Lanka Standards Institution (SLSI).
The GMP certificate ensures food cleanness, correct food separation, proper temperature of food and also personal hygiene practices.
“We will conduct islandwide awareness programmes to educate owners of eating houses, canteens and catering services regarding this law.
Then, Consumer Affairs Authority investigating officers together with Public Health Inspectors (PHIs) of the Ministry of Health will carry out field investigations and take legal action against the errant owners of eating places and catering services,” Munaweera said.
“We are trying to implement this law to ensure consumer food safety.The direction covers a wide spectrum of food-related businesses including mass caterers and outdoor caterers.
This will ensure hygienic practices in all catering establishments and it applies to catering in hotels, restaurants and other institutions such as schools, hospitals, plants and factories.
Provisions are made for proper sanitary facilities and controls which include water supply, hand-washing
and toilet facilities, prevention of pests,drainage and waste disposal, living quarters and staff amenities,” the SLSI Senior Deputy Director said.
