Inter-faith collaboration edges out extremism: PM

While offering the foremost place to Buddhism, the government is taking measures to protect other religions. When all religions work in unity and collaboration, extremism gets eliminated. Even Emperor Asoka through his inscription has exhorted people to respect all religions in keeping with Buddhism, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said.
The Prime Minister made these observations addressing a meeting at Temple Trees, on Tuesday to mark the distribution of financial assistance among 150 temples towards archaeological conservation and development work.
The Prime Minister said ancient Buddhist temples and Raja Maha Viharayas were significant places connected to the Sinhala Buddhist heritage. Some of these temples had murals dating back to Sinhala kings ranging from king Devanampiyatissa to Sri Wickrema Rajasinghe.
Education Minister Akila Viraj Kariyawasam is taking measures to assist the conservation of ancient temples, he said.
“We should strive to protect the archaeological heritage and national culture. The Central Culture Fund is assisting the development and conservation of ancient temples as they lack sufficient funds for the exercise,” the Prime Minister said.
It was to carry forward this work that they formed a national government under the leadership of President Maithripala Sirisena. While forging religious amity and reconciliation, the government was trying to protect and conserve the Buddhist heritage, he said.
The President helped these efforts with enthusiasm, he said.
Sri Lanka occupies a prominent place for protecting Theravada Buddhism and spreading it to South East Asia, including Myanmar, Thailand, Cambodia, Laos and Vietnam, he said.
The Prime Minister said the government launched programmes to develop temples and Dagabas in the country. Work on the Maha Viharaya has been entrusted with the Archaeological Department and the Central Cultural Fund.
The government will assist conservation work in Kapilavastu and Lumbini in consultation with the government of Nepal. Steps would be taken to renovate and rehabilitate the Sri Dalada Maligawa, Prime Minister Wickremesinghe said.
