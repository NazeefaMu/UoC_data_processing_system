Plantation  crisis and  solutions

Large commercial plantations are considered as a ‘country within a country’ and most planters do go through trying circumstances with physical and mental stress as a given! They now need to gird themselves with what it takes with a professional and results-based approach to conquer the challenges thrown at them in the future.
Looking ahead to the future, we see that the plantations that move away from mono-crop models to multi-crops and optimize the varied and rich resources found in plantations will still be the mainstay of our economy.
We hope that agro-based business encompassing alternate power, unconventional, adventure tourism to name a few, along with multi-cropping ventures, would elicit much attention by the state and indeed by multinational corporate entities than ever before as plantations embark on a new beginning that is lying latent – only to be seized with those blessed with courage and vision!
Learn from past lapses
We don’t wish to dwell on the lapses of the past; neither do we wish to blame individuals or organizations but we need to make certain that we avoid such destructive mistakes in future. We have been stressing on the systematic killing of the plantations industry of Sri Lanka due to mostly short-term rapacious ‘exploits’ through a series of newspaper articles during the past two years.
We thank all those newspapers wholeheartedly for the yeomen service to the nation by publishing them amidst fierce propaganda by a small, yet influential group of people claiming to be the industry leaders.
We believe that there is fundamentally not much wrong with most employees of the industry but the leadership of certain RPCS led to a point of almost no return for the industry. If we scan the RPCs, it is not difficult to understand that the root cause for better performing RPCs and poorly performing RPCs is the CEO or indeed the greedy Board of Directors who have made a pawn of CEOs.
These CEOs get the blame for making their ravenous owners happy. Not that they aren’t aware of the consequences of extractive agriculture or inexplicable investments away from the core business but their survival depends on the ability of making these owners delighted. Ours is a country where such highly paid jobs (of CEO) are scarce, especially to the incompetent. So these incompetent CEOs choose a winning strategy to delight their master (owner) by hook or by crook and safeguard their self-interests, perks and benefits, unmindful that the plantations are being destructively exploited. We find that certain stockbrokers are also guilty of not disclosing the truth to the investors and making a fast buck by devious and unethical means.
A CEO must have the competencies to perceive change and proactively execute appropriate strategies that will be dramatic in mitigating the impacts of the escalating costs and managing other risks. That includes the growth of the business as well. The resources are going to be scarce when the population keeps on increasing.
We propose that these CEOs who hardly perceive the practical reality of supply and demand but wait for opportunities to assign blame to anyone, be trained at PIM through short courses. PIM has been conducting similar programs in the past for senior executives of other industries and they have been performing absolutely great following the training. In terms of interventions through HRM, there are many CEO coachs and consultancy firms in the market that can help these top executives until they become fit to perform their jobs. These are the short term strategies the Ministry of Plantations Industries can launch. Most CEOs heading those poorly performing RPCs, are adequate ‘trainable material’ with loads of experience.
Areas of concern
It is patently clear that opportunities are lost when diversification onto other crops are not carried out in a timely manner. Such favorable crops could afford to attract and retain high-calibre professionals. Furthermore, lack of attention to soil development and enrichment, poor attitude towards groundwater retention, not proactively mitigating the risks and realities of climate change, lack of developing people objectively and systematically, not adding value to the process (entire value chain) or to the product, not undertaking lifecycle analysis and no initiatives to decrease inefficiency of both men and machinery are a handful of such reasons.
It is the responsibility of the CEOs to manage them. That is why we say that the blame should be placed fairly on to mediocre qualitydecision-making. Who is fooling whom? The excessive cost of the industry is due to low productivity, poor quality (land, labour, machinery, power) and the waste of energy. The production of crops has gradually diminished over the years. This is one of the main reasons why the labour productivity has plummeted. Do the RPCs expect the productivity to be brought by the employees from their respective homes? It is the duty of successful agribusiness managers not to allow a single ray of sunlight to go waste without being converted into cash.
Why ask for glyphosate?
To re-cap, we use five types of weeding mechanisms such as contact herbicides, selective weedicides, translocate weedicides, systemic weedicides and cultural weeding practices by bush-to-bush merger and planting an appropriate leguminous cover crop on the vacant patches so that weeds can be easily controlled, etc. Ideally weeds need to ‘tackled’ before they reach flowering stage as flowers produce seeds that germinate when ‘right’ conditions such as ‘good soil, moisture and sunlight are available. Whilst ‘good soil’ and moisture cannot be controlled, sunlight could be, by proper cultural methods.
In agriculture, the scientists recommend a combination of organic and inorganic fertilizers. In the plantation agriculture, the recommendations are to use chemical or inorganic fertilizer only. In reality, the subject of fertilizer is a combination of organic, inorganic and soil pH in backdrop of hydrolysis. We understand that the Institute of Nano Technology has come out with a fertilizer with organic, inorganic properties and a buffer action to correct pH. Without the soil carbon or the organic properties of the soil, the microbes will not thrive. In the absence of microbes, the soil becomes almost dead or sterile. It is these microbes which convert artificial or chemical fertilizer into plant food that is consumed through the demand created due to plant metabolism activities.
The requirement of chemical fertilizer too can be reduced due to the increase in the useful microbial population of bacteria and fungi. Furthermore, this will also be useful in managing diseases and retention of soil moisture with soil temperature that is conducive for higher yields.
Fertilizer plays an important role in agriculture. Usage of fertilizer becomes useless without a proper understanding of the important role played by soil. The global agriculture is moving towards ‘precision agriculture’ and LEISA techniques such as low external inputs and sustainable agriculture. This is another reason why the costs are high. Organic and integrated farming concepts have enough to offer in this direction of animal husbandry and crop production. We are very vulnerable to impending droughts without maintaining a proper soil structure, which can again send our costs through the roof.
Yet, what do we do? We blame the employees for high costs. When farmers all over the world use drones like technologies to improve overall efficiencies, we keep on blaming the employees for non-existent issues in order to hide our lunacy.
This is why we say that the Prime Minister has understood the reality, compounded by errant RPCs.
A grand investment opportunity
If there are any entrepreneurs interested in land-based investments leading to profitable business outcomes, a plantation of Sri Lanka will undoubtedly be an ideal opportunity. The infrastructure is well developed and supports to exploit the untapped potential for residential development, commercial development, export crop producing, growing of medicinal herbs, livestock raising, growing of valuable timber, mineral production, vegetable farms, vineyards, orchards, warehousing, processing plants and even recreational activities (outdoor adventure) leading to health and fitness; these aresome opportunities, just to name a few.
Do we have a product in tea?
I am not going to much detail on this subject as I had elaborated on same in the last article of mine which appeared in the newspapers last month. Anyway, it is most unfortunate that for the last 150 years, we have been unable to develop a product due to lack of a product. If products were developed out of tea, then there won’t be a need for an auction system as products are marketed and not auctioned.
Therefore, the decision makers and the government must be conscious enough to refrain from spending millions on selling commodities overseas on the disguise of ‘tea promotion’. Let’s have a look at how a product is defined and compare with what we call a product to understand how to do better.
A product attributes include size, color, functionality, components and features that affect the product's appeal or acceptance in the market. The industry must hire food scientists and food technology experts to develop a product. We hope that those holding high positions are aware of basics of marketing and how to make a consumer friendly product that will be in high demand. Both Jayewardenepura and Peradeniya Universities can be made use for this gigantic task which is peanuts for the scientists there.
A good example in this regard is Dilmah tea. This much sought-after product received its global recognition on the strength of the finest Ceylon tea. In the light of this definition, all of us are well aware that only a very little has been done by the RPC management to create a product, except maybe by a few. Tea can be made to be a health food by extracting its medicinal properties (anti-oxidants) and soft gel capsuling it. Never to underestimate our potential due to availability of seven types of different teas in here on their agroclimatic locations. The question is where are our goals and strategies to move this industry forward? We do not have a vision, let alone goals and strategies. Whom do we blame for the dire state of this industry?
Let us get out of this ‘blame culture’. It’s never too late to make a change. We believe that the tea industry can be turned around to become a US$ 10 billion industry. Whilst we assure the total commitment in achieving this goal as planters, the other professionals such as finance, accountants, marketing, IT, economists, agronomists, and HRM must come out with hybrid strategies as enablers of making it happen. For planters ‘nothing is impossible’. For that, they have been trained to bloom wherever they plant!
For the first time the CPS, PA and NIPM have embarked on a timely effort in defining the profession of a planter. “A planter leads an agribusiness professionally to reach desired growth sustainably.” The objective of this initiative is to define the profession and also to develop a set of professional standards which are a fitting intervention at a time we celebrate 150 years of tea in Sri Lanka.
In conclusion, we agree with Albert Einstein and it is about time that we start with the ‘end in mind’. We must be crystal clear as to what we expect from the business of plantation management. Will it be a smart plantation or else conventional? How do we plan the growth? What are our retention and cost mitigating strategies? What are our product or services portfolios? Are we going to go green and what is our business model, are some of the key areas that we should be clear.
We proposed a financial goal of US$ 10 billion revenue per year from the industry. All master plans developed so far for the plantations industry must be used to develop ‘implementation and monitoring strategies’. The implementation should be with the qualified professionals such as operations, HRM, marketing, finance, engineering and IT/ICT. It’s only through a qualified and competent head (CEO) armed with requisite skills of managing these professionals to achieve the planned goals. Needless to say, if history repeats itself, it will be the final snap of the rope ending in the doom of the plantation industry.
Over to you Mr Prime Minister. Your Minister in charge of the industry will never let you fail. We are fully aware of the smart strategies employed by your Minister in bringing in appropriate technology from the best countries to improve efficiencies of theoverall systems of plantations industries.
We need the right mindset and attitude from the top to bottom. We also need advanced technologies, right products, improvements in per capita income, more employment opportunities in plantations and we need ahigh-performance culture in the industry.
The turning point is discipline which must be upheld always. This paves the way for the formation of the Green Army and that’s all employees in uniforms. High level of physical fitness to all grades involved in plantation agriculture is compulsory. How do you expect all those who cannot walk to go to the fields and set as an example to the staff and workers? A fit mindset will remain always inside a physically fit body.
We are with you and looking for opportunities for restoring beyond much spoken former glory. Mr Prime Minister, you know that you have to break eggs to make omelettes. Also we need to remind you of one more HRM principle and that is - right people drive business. This applies to the entire country.
