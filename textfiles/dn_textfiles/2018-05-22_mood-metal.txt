Mood for metal

Neurocracy are metal band whose ‘metal’ journey is in its infancy but already have an awesome following due to their sensational music and spirit. Melodies speaks to Chathuranga Pitigala of Neurocracy who puts their success down to the fact that they are thick as theives and also because they are very talented.
“I joined Neurocracy about two years ago. I was working at TNL and I was contacted by Gayan the lead guitarist and composer of Neurocracy who is incidentally a doctor in Ragama Hospital. He told me that they are looking for a drummer and if I would be interested in being that drummer? From the first practice onwards I felt pretty good about the guys. They seemed very professional and organized and the music sounded brilliant! There was a real sense of camaraderie and brotherhood. It was pretty cool,” said Pitigala.
The band have two main themes they touch on, which are the adverse effects of organized religion and politics. Currently it is probably more political than religious.
“We are definitely a Metal band. More accurately we are a progressive death metal band. We are all very passionate about Metal. In regards to how I got into music, well music kind of discovered me. Music is the greatest escape there is, and it is also totally therapeutic. It is a language that transcends almost everything. There is a unique connection that music has with a person and with people. It is inspirational. Personally, I do it because I like to drum, listen to metal and play metal. It is something I am passionate about,” explained Pitigala.
Neurocracy can never forget their loyal and devoted following. The fans have been with them right throughout, listening to their music.
“So far the response from our fans has been pretty overwhelming. We have fans in places I have never anticipated about and that do surprise me. The first time I played for Neurocracy was in Gampaha. That was an awesome gig because the place was pretty packed. I am amazed at how quickly our band progressed in the music scene, especially in how we grew in such a short space of time. I guess its because despite being a new band, our members are pretty seasoned in the local scene. Our fans are enthusiastic and it is a pleasure to have such loyal fans. I regard that as a blessing and a privilege, and I feel the same way about being a part of this band,” pointed out Pitigala.
Pitigala added that he does not really think there is a music industry in Sri Lanka, and that so far Neurocracy has so far received one radio interview and a few publications. Right now they have played three or four shows but their main focus is their upcoming album.
“Our journey is only beginning. In addition to Metal we delve into a lot of other genres as well. As progressive Metal musicians we are exposed to a wide variety of outside influences. Our album has a few jazzy parts as well and then there are some Latin parts as well, at least as far as drums are concerned. I can say all of us to a great deal love exploring new ventures and influences, but our back bone and foundation will always be Metal,” added Pitigala.
He pointed out that one of the main strengths of the band was that they are very balanced.
“Overall I would say our band is very well balanced. Everyone is on the same page. Everyone works together in order to attain the goal of the group. I am so thankful that everyone is committed. We have no weak links in the chain. I am so humbled to be in this band where everyone is on the ball. Like any family, team or brotherhood we have disagreements every now and then, but 90 percent of the time we are working towards the same thing and everyone holds their weight which is really inspirational for me,” explained Pitigala.
Gampaha will forever be etched in his memory as a milestone in his life. That was a memorable day and a memorable performance.
“All our gigs are very important and special but for me what stands out is the Gampaha show. That was the first time I played in Gampaha. Then we played the Maelstrom Festival which was pretty big. The frontman of Rudra, a Singaporean band joined us. We got to share the stage with some pretty renowned musicians like ‘Darkest Horizon’ from Germany and ‘Court of Arms’ from Dubai,” said Pitigala.
Neurocracy are very much in touch with the happenings in the country through their music. They are also very much in touch with their emotions.
“We just focus on the music we love and we compose songs. But we are all very angry at the state of the country, the political situation and the civil unrest. There is a lot chaos occurring in the country at the moment, and many are willfully blind to it. So in a way we are channeling anger and frustration that into our music. At least I am where my drumming is concerned,” stated Pitigala.
With an album coming out they are really making their presence felt in the music scene in Sri Lanka.
“The journey for us is still at its infancy and we have not even put out our first album as yet. That will come out this year. Being able to work with my bandmates is a blessing. Every time I get on stage I am really surprised at how many people I see! So the audience has been really amazing. It makes me proud.
We are really ambitious and I am hoping we can put out another album like next year, because we are working on some new songs as well. The singles we have released are ‘Anatomy of Skin’ and ‘Freedom Fighter’ and we recently launched a music video for ‘Totalitaria’. There’s this one song coming up which is called ‘Divine Massacre’ which will be really interesting and I think our fans are really going to like it. It is one of our most ambitious songs,” explained Pitigala.
Pitigala truly loves being a Metalhead. It is who he is and it is his passion.
“I am a fairly spiritual person so this is actually a journey for me. Sometimes life makes things happen and there is no organized structure really. I think sometimes it is just fate. Metal as a whole, as a concept and a culture, is like a religion to me, although that might not make sense for anyone who is not a Metalhead,” summed up Pitigala.
