Commercial Bank raises remittance stakes with Gedarata Thégi

Offers over Rs.4 million in prizes with Datsun Redi-GO car as grand prize
For those who may need more, there are now another 101 reasons to receive remittances via the Commercial Bank of Ceylon in 2017.
Sri Lanka’s benchmark private sector bank is offering recipients of remittances the chance to win a veritable treasure trove of 101 gifts – a car, four scooters, 12 LED TVs and 84 cash prizes in its exciting Gedarata Thégi (Gifts for the Home) promotion unveiled on January 18.
Users of e Exchange, Commercial Bank’s own money transfer service, as well as those who receive remittances via MoneyGram, Express Money and Ria from January 1 to December 31 will automatically go into a series draws in respect of each quarter of the year to win these prizes, the Bank said.
Holders of a Commercial Bank Remittance Card – a branded Debit cum ATM Card licensed by Visa Inc. – who receive remittances via the Bank during the year will double their winning chances at these draws.
Three quarterly draws have been scheduled for the 17th of each month in April, July and October 2017, at which recipients of remittances in the preceding three months will vie for a scooter, three LED TVs and 21 cash prizes of Rs 10,000 each, per draw. The Grand Draw on 17th January 2018 will offer the same prizes plus a Datsun Redi-GO car.
“There are many reasons why Commercial Bank is already a preferred choice for remittances,” the Bank’s Chief Manager eBanking and Remittances Mr Pradeep Banduwansa said. ‘Nevertheless, we look for ways every year to add value and enliven the process by rewarding recipients in meaningful ways. This year’s Gedarata Thégi promotion will certainly generate much excitement in the market.”
Commercial Bank is one of the most active players in Sri Lanka in the field of remittances, offering customers a range of options including ‘e-Exchange’ – the Bank’s own sophisticated real-time on-line money transfer service, as well as international money transfer services such asMoneyGram, Ria and Express Money remittance services.
One of the Bank’s key strengths is its island-wide network of 256 branches, many of which remain open on public, bank and mercantile holidays, and its network of 659 ATMs, which is the largest automated cash dispensing system owned by a single bank in Sri Lanka.
Recipients of remittances sent to the Bank enjoy many benefits such as over 65 holiday banking centres and super market counters, a dedicated customer support call centre for remittances and SMS alerts facilities once the remittance is received and is ready to be paid out.
The only Sri Lankan bank to be ranked among the Top 1000 banks of the world for six years consecutively, Commercial Bank has won multiple awards as Sri Lanka’s Best Bank, Best Trade Bank, Strongest Bank, Most Respected Bank from a number of local and international institutions and publications over several years and has also been adjudged one of Sri Lanka’s 10 best corporate citizens by the Ceylon Chamber of Commerce for several years.
