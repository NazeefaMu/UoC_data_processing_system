“The Bank considers its team of employees as one of its greatest strengths. Every effort is being made to ensure the well-being of staff. The attrition rate, which is below 1%, is one of the lowest in the industry, which speaks volumes of the bank’s HR management processes. Right from the start of their careers, all new recruits are provided with an induction training so that they can easily blend into the culture and work ethics of the Bank,” said Deputy General Manager Human Resource, K.E.D. Sumanasiri.
