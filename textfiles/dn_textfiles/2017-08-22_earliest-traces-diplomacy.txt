Earliest traces of Diplomacy

Book Review
Title: Buddhism in UN system
Author: Jayantha Pathirana
The present work is on Buddhism in UN system. He has produced this work with the conviction: I quote – Now I firmly believe that the UN system could harness the teachings of the Supreme Buddha who had been taught 2561 years ago, and would be pertinent and applicable to the development of the objectives of the UN system (p. ix). Interestingly the publication of this book coincided with the celebration of UN Vesak Day, held in Sri Lanka just after this Vesak which marks the 2561st year in the Buddha era.
As many of you know, a resolution was passed in an International Buddhist Conference held in Colombo in 1998 to request UN to declare Vesak an international religious holiday. In 1999 our then Foreign Minister, the late Lakshman Kadirgamar tabled the resolution and as unanimously adopted by UN General Assembly Vesak as a day of observance. In 2016 it has been upgraded to an optional holiday, still falling short of making Vesak a full-fledged UN religious holiday. Let’s hope that it will happen soon!
When we think of UN we are thinking of a gigantic and global organisation the scope of which the entire globe we live in.
What does the teaching of the Buddha teach in ancient India about 25 centuries back has to do with this global organisation? With globalization, religion today has become globalized. This is in an organisational sense. But what is even more important is for a religion to have a global vision at its very foundation. As I have mentioned in the foreword to this book, the Buddha, as Prince/Ascetic Siddhartha, began with such a vision, in fact, a vision expanding much beyond the globe we live into the universe which is described in the Buddhist texts as ‘the system of ten thousand worlds.’ Let me quote again what was in Siddhartha’s mind when he renounced his household life in search of what is ‘wholesome’ (kim-kusala-gavesi).
Universal significance
Bhikkhus, before my enlightenment while I was still a Bodhisattva, not yet fully enlightened, it occurred to me: Alas, this world has fallen into trouble, in that it is born, ages and dies, it passes away and is reborn, yet it does not understand the escape from this suffering (headed by ageing and death). When now will escape be discerned from this suffering….? (Samyutta-Nikaya: Nidana Samyutta: The Connected Discourse of the Buddha, translated by Bhikkhu Bodhi, p. 537).
What is revealed in this statement of the Buddha is not the popular view that Siddhartha left home in search of freedom from his own suffering. The focus here is not oneself but the world including oneself and all others. Interestingly it is said that at the conclusion of his first sermon which outlined the four noble truths, the crux of his message to the suffering world, it spread to the highest point of the world system, Akanitthaka Brahma world. One could again dismiss this type of statement as a mere result of religious sentiment. But I think this has a more important figurative significance, namely, that the word of the Buddha had a universal significance, applicable to all sentient beings without any limitation.
If UN and Buddhism have anything in common it is this global/universal view. The destruction caused by the 2nd World War was the immediate reason behind the birth of UN. It was to adopt measures to prevent recurrence of another similar catastrophe and at the very beginning, it identified the ultimate location of war in human mind, an analysis not different from that of Buddhism. Even though human problems originate in the human mind, it does not function in isolation. What happens in mind have causes and conditions outside. The answers cannot merely be inner but require outer solutions requiring structures to implement them. What the author of this book means by combining the UN and the teaching of the Buddha must be to underscore the relation between inner and outer.
The key themes of the book are peace, security, disarmament and human rights, themes associated with UN quite closely. The author proposes that these lofty goals can be achieved by making use of the teachings of the Buddha. Although this is not a totally new piece of information what it noteworthy is the way these UN goals are connected with Buddhist insights. The author deserves our praise for the commendable job he does in order to establish his case.
At this point, rather than summarizing the content of the book, let me briefly address an issue that comes up in discussions of Buddhism in conjunction with themes such as violence, peace and human rights and then wind up. I think it is particularly pertinent to discuss this matter taking into consideration the fact that this book contains a chapter on ‘hysteria on Tamil Eelam in Sri Lanka’ and also the current state of affairs in which Buddhism is being taken to task for allegedly using violence against Muslims. The title of the latest book edited by Professor John Holt Buddhist Extremists and Muslim Minorities says it all.
The often asked question in this context is: how can Buddhism, a peaceful religion, resort to violence? The implicit assertion is that while others are free to do whatever they like, Buddhists, being followers of a peaceful religion, should bear such activities without any violent reaction.
Buddhist political philosophy
This position does not leave much for Buddhists, either they have to let others destroy them or simply concede defeat and save their lives. History reveals that Buddhists have done both depending on situations. However, they also have resisted violence and have returned violence with violence by way of resistance and have managed to survive amidst those who are there to destroy them. But, according to others, this is in violation of the Dhamma! It appears that the only consistent position a Buddhist is left with is self-sacrifice. If all Buddhists chose this option Buddhism would have died long back. Fortunately, the majority have not resorted to this option. And the common sense says that this cannot be the Buddhist answer.
On the one hand, there is an inconsistency and irony when one who does not accept the Buddhist religion admonishes Buddhists to be peaceful. If the opponent says so in order to drag the Buddhist to the war/conflict by showing untenability of the Buddhist position then that is at least fair. But when the opponent admonishes the Buddhist he does so in order to stop the latter adhering to violence, so that he himself is benefitted by that. In doing so the opponent is falsely contributing to the view which he does not really believe in and aims to get undue advantage from the belief system of the Buddhist. In other words, you make use of the Buddhist teaching itself to make the Buddhist an easy target!
Perhaps, in this context, we can draw some lessons from the long history of Buddhism: Emperor Asoka who followed the Buddhist political philosophy gave up aggression for good. This, however, does not mean that he dismantled his army.
Although, the ‘armed peace’ (to borrow from SWRD Bandaranaike, former Prime Minister of Sri Lanka), is not the best option it is inevitable for a country to have an army to protect itself. The Buddhist monks of Chan/Zen tradition of ancient China and Japan developed ‘karate’ (empty hand) only as a way of self-defence (for they did not believe in self-sacrifice when their existence was at stake). Accordingly, Buddhism is not peaceful to the extent that it admonishes its followers to embrace death/extinction rather than fighting for survival.
The discussion on violence brings us to the issue of human rights. Thanks to UN we have an elaborate conception of human rights and we consider human rights to be sacrosanct and inviolable. But what baffles the common sense logic is when we hear about human rights of terrorists who speak only the language of the gun. Sri Lanka armed forces which terminated the LTTE terrorism has been accused of violating human rights of terrorists. The question is: whose human rights that matter, those of terrorists or of their victims? If there is such a thing called human rights of terrorists and if Sri Lanka armed forces violated their human rights, one thing is clear, namely, that in doing so they have safeguarded the human rights of more than twenty-one million people in this country. What the Prime Minister of England recently said to the world after the Manchester attack clearly shows that human rights are not final.
The author of this book has discussed the theory of Buddhism and has taken pains to show how Buddhism has answers. In my presentation, I tried to highlight some of the practical issues associated in particular with Buddhism. But not only Buddhism but also religion, in general, is under increasing scrutiny today. According to some, the answer is to abandon religion altogether and embrace secularism with the hope to make an end to religiously motivated problems.
Emotionally dishonest
According to some others, the answer is to adhere to relativism and opt to follow all or more than one religion. In my opinion, both these options are misguided. Secularism, while doing away with the ills of organised religion, robs humanity of what is good in it. Relativism, leading to simultaneous dual or multiple religious belonging, could be intellectually lacking, emotionally dishonest and spiritually confusing. What is problematic is not adherence to a particular religion, but to hold that any religion, except that of one’s own, should not exist. So long as there is even one religion that believes that it alone should exist and all others should perish there will not be peace in the world. This brings us to the need for religions to come up with an ethics that transcends themselves.
Finally, the author of this book, Jayantha Pathirana, tells us that Buddhism can give eyes to the UN system. This does not need to be understood as a parochial assertion that only Buddhism can do it. All religions will have their own ways to achieve this result. Jayantha Pathirana, on his part, has brought into light the religion he knows best and follows in his life. We must congratulate him on this job done well.
