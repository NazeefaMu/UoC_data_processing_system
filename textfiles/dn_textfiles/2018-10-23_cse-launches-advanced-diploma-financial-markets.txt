CSE launches Advanced Diploma in Financial Markets

The Colombo Stock Exchange (CSE) recently launched an Advanced Diploma in Financial Markets (ADFM) academic qualification, where the program for the first intake of students is presently underway.
This is the first occasion CSE will award an academic qualification in its history, and is an initiative implemented in response to a growing demand for an entry-level academic qualification to be awarded by the exchange to foster greater knowledge on financial markets, particularly with a specific focus on capital market operations and investment.
The ADFM course is designed to offer students a comprehensive understanding of financial markets and focuses on areas such as capital market regulation, investment analysis, portfolio management, macro-economics and other related subject matters.
Commenting on the initiative, the CEO at CSE, Rajeeva Bandaranaike said, “The CSE is recognized as a key stakeholder in the capital market and has built a substantial level of expertise during its operation for over 30 years. Through this initiative, we look to combine that know-how with the expertise of renowned visiting academic professionals to deliver a balanced and practical course to students.”
“Stock Exchanges around the world and even in South Asia have formalized their education efforts through the establishment of institutes and with the awarding of market related qualifications. We believe that the introduction of ADFM in that sense is certainly a step in the right direction and will enhance our efforts to foster financial literacy,” Bandaranaike said.
The modules will pave the way for students to apply theoretical knowledge while gaining a unique level of exposure into financial market operations. The course is expected to be completed within a six month period, where CSE will also take the initiative to offer internship opportunities to top performers.
The modules will be conducted by an eminent panel of lectures consisting of respected local university lecturers and capital market experts. The next intake of students for the program is set to be conducted in January 2018 and will be announced on the CSE website www.cse.lk
