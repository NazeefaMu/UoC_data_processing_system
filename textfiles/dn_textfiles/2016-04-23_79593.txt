FIFA announces body to monitor Qatar 2022 labour conditions

DOHA, Qatar, Friday – Gianni Infantino announced on Friday that FIFA will establish a body to monitor working conditions for labourers at Qatar's 2022 World Cup stadiums and insisted the tournament would stay in the Gulf.
Speaking during his first visit to Doha as president of world football's governing body, Infantino said FIFA would act on criticisms it has done little to protect those building venues for its showcase tournament in six years’ time.
“We will not just sit and wait,” he told journalists at a press conference.
“FIFA will step up its efforts in overseeing -- in particular the set-up by the (Qatar) Supreme Committee -- in order to ensure the protection of the workers’ rights in the construction of the FIFA World Cup sites.”
He added that the proposal had been welcomed by the “highest Qatari authorities”.
The body would monitor systems in place to ensure decent working conditions, and would be independent, added Infantino.
Infantino added: “FIFA is not the world welfare agency... our job is to govern football, but of course we are aware of our responsibilities.”
