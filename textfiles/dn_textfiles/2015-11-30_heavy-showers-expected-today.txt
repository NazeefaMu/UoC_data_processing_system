Heavy showers expected today

 
The Meteorological Department this morning forecasted heavy showers and thundershowers in most parts of the island this afternoon (30). Showery weather over the island and neighboring sea areas will be high due to the atmospheric disturbance in the vicinity of Sri Lanka.
Heavy rain falls (about 100 mm) are likely to take place in some places. There may be temporary localized strong winds during thundershowers.
The Department of Meteorology advices the general public to take adequate precautions to minimize damages caused by lightning activity.
