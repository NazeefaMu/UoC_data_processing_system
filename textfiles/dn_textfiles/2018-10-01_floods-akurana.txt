Floods in Akurana

Akurana town and the adjoining area in the Kandy district were flooded following heavy rains on Saturday evening.
Akurana and a two-kilometre stretch towards Katugastota on the A9 road were totally submerged causing heavy damage to property as the Piga Oya started overflowing due to heavy rains.
A group of people in a bus which went under water were rescued by villagers near Akurana town.
According to police, around 50 vehicles were stranded in the floodwaters and the damage to property may run into millions of rupees.
Kandy Disaster Management Centre Assistant Director Indika Ranaweera said the floods were mainly due to unauthorised structures built near and across the Piga Oya.
He said due to this fact, if there is heavy rain, the Piga Oya starts overflowing and Akurana town gets flooded.
Ranaweera said this has happened on several previous occasions and added that authorities should take a decision about these unauthorised structures without delay.
The Meteorological Department says due to a low-level atmospheric disturbance in the vicinity of Sri Lanka, the prevailing wet weather is likely to continue during the next few days.
