Rotary Club of Negombo celebrates milestone

The Rotary Club of Negombo will celebrate 80 years of service this year, since it received its charter on March 28 in 1938. It is the second oldest Rotary Club in Sri Lanka.
Rotary was introduced to Ceylon, as it was then known, way back in 1929 and quite correctly they identified the capital of the country to form the first Rotary Club; thus the Rotary Club of Colombo was inaugurated on July 5, 1925 and received its charter on December 6, 1929, at a ceremony held at the Galle Face Hotel, Colombo.
Thereafter, they searched for important towns in the country and Negombo was identified as one such town for the propagation of Rotary islandwide. Due preference and recognition was given to Negombo. The Rotary Club of Negombo came to be sponsored by the Rotary Club of Colombo in 1937 and received its charter the following year. The Club was formed with 24 members selected from amongst the elite businessmen and professionals in the area.
T.W. Hockley who was the head of Police, Municipal Commissioner and District Judge, has the singular honour of being elected as the charter President of the club and held the office of the President of the club during the Rotary year 1937-38.
Over the past 79 years, the club has engaged in humanitarian and service-oriented work and has grown in maturity and strength to be one of the foremost Rotary clubs in the Rotary District 3220, said incumbent President Rtn. Expedit Croos.
As per convention, Rotary membership is exclusive to professionals, proprietary planters, and businessmen of repute in the area. Respected politicians of the calibre of the late Shirley Corea and former Speaker of the House of Representatives and Parliamentarian, late Paris Perera were all past Presidents of the club.
The club records a rich heritage of membership comprising a blend of lawyers, doctors, engineers, architects, and businessmen of repute, currently with a membership of 62.
Croos observed that they their work has been mostly concentrated in and around Negombo, but, at times, has also extended even up to Kilinochchi when required.
“Our work in the recent past emulates our desire to be the top-most club in the region,” he added.
The event will be celebrated under the theme ‘Mighty Eighty Anniversary’ with two separate musical shows being held on April 6 and 7, 2018.
On April 6, they will have a musical evening at Grandeeza, Negombo, at 7.30 pm, followed with ‘Chai Sundown’ at Jetwing Beach Hotel, Negombo, on April 7, at 5pm.
