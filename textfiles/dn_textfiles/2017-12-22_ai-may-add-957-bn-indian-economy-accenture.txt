AI may add $957 bn to Indian Economy: Accenture

Research paper released on Thursday by tech giant Accenture revealed that artificial intelligence (AI) could add 957 billion dollar to the Indian economy by changing the nature of work to create better outcomes for businesses and society.
The report, ‘Rewire for Growth,’ estimates that AI has the potential to increase India’s annual growth rate of gross value added (GVA) by 1. 3 percentage points, lifting the country’s income by 15 percent in 2035.
