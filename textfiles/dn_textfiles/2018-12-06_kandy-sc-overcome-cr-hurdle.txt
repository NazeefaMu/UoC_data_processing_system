Kandy SC overcome CR hurdle

Kandy Sports Club continued the defence of their league title by beating another top club CR & FC in a Dialog rugby championship match played at Nittawela last Sunday.
It was Kandy’s fly half Nigel Ratwatte who ran a couple of ploys, due to the good work done by the forwards. It was the forwards who won the match for them. Ratwatte with good ball coming from the forwards really upped the pace and Thilina Wijesinghe’s kicking was pretty good.
Kandy’s were quite direct in their forward play. They made CR & FC tackle and that made them tired.
The first half took its toll on the Red shirts. Tarinda Ratwatte kicked three penalties in a row, and every time they went forward they tried their best to make it one way. In the second half they failed to do so. CR & FC besieged the Kandy line early on but a huge effort from the home side gave them the opportunity to clear. The home team were finding it difficult on and off to gain territory but their defence continued to hold firm and what possession they had in hand they moved steadily forward. Kandy continued to find half gaps and put CR & FC in their place due to which they were unable to cut through cleanly.
After being equal in the first half 14-all the Kandy team showed character. They were up against a very good defence and sometimes that takes a huge effort. CR & FC were excellent at the breakdown but the willingness of all the carriers in the team; they were brilliant right until the end of the game.
CR & FC arrived in Kandy hoping to build on the promise to win their fourth game of the season but as the game wore on, the pace of Kandy proved too much and CR had to surrender the lead.
The table at the end of the fourth week: 1. Kandy SC 4/4/0/24 pts, 2. Havelock SC 4/4/0/22 pts, 3. CR & FC 4/3/1/16 pts, 4. Navy SC 4/2/2/13 pts, 5. Army SC 4/2/2/11 pts 6. CH & FC 4/1/3/9 pts, 7. Police 4/0/4/3 pts.
