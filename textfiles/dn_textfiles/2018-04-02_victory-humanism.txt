The victory of humanism

Joyce is one of those writers who are neither permitted to be without beliefs nor believed about their freedom from such encumbrances; and the title of Mr. Morse’s book seems at first to promise exegesis of a dubious kind. We have had more than one recent attempt to present Joyce’s work as the embodiment of orthodoxy, however inverted.
The obscurity of Finnegans Wake encourages the idea that behind it must lie a portentous message and provokes attempts to read a cosmology into it. Since one particular philosophy of history, Vico’s, is used in it as a structural device, the confusion is easy. All this is a pity, inasmuch as it distracts from true criticism; and it is ultimately as false and as distorting as the opposite and rather more old-fashioned picture of Joyce the atheist presiding in gratified horror over a godless world, so torn by his own apostasy and consequent vision of futility and loathsomeness that his work is simply an expression of a Swiftian disgust.
Human material
Joyce was born in a country where Roman Catholicism is a fact like climate or history, so that it was forever part of his consciousness and his human material; and it seems to be sometimes forgotten that such material could not be dealt with at all without reference to it. Besides, he enjoyed theological discussion in the abstract and respected it as a way of thought; and he employed it gratefully, as he employed so much else, both as parody and as structure in his work.
He continued all his life to use, sometimes ironically, sometimes affectionately, sometimes satirically, the terminology of what had not only been his faith but is, after all, a very great structure of human thought.
Mr. Morse examines some of the many ways in which he did use it. He does this without bias but he is inclined, like many recent Joyce commentators, to indulge in flights of fancy, to build too much on too little; he is too dogmatic where the facts do not warrant dogmatism or where there are no facts at all: and he is too chary—for one who shows evidence of a brilliant critical faculty—of criticism. He tells us that the scorn of literary criticism of another Joyce commentator—and good critic—Mrs. Glasheen has “some what chastened” his own practice of it; his book might have been better if the critic had chastened the commentator more often.
Some of the correspondences with Augustine, Loyola, Scotus Erigena, William of Ockham and the Old Testament on which Mr. Morse depends may arise simply from the fact that both Joyces work and that of the fathers and doctors from whom Mr. Morse quotes are deeply grounded in human nature. The difficulty is to say when Joyce is consciously using an idea or a definition of Augustine’s, say, as part of his structure, when he is doing it unconsciously because it was part of his mental furniture, when the apparent use is sheer coincidence, and when it is sheer fancy on Mr. Morse’s part. Thus, when Mr. Morse tells us:
Sinner’s burden
All sins, says Saint Augustine can be summed up under three heads: the lusts of the flesh, intellectual curiosity and pride. Almost everything Bloom does or enjoys is a sin. Almost everything Dedalus does or enjoys is a sin. In this however they are not alone: all Dubliners, knowingly or unknowingly, bear the Christian’s burden.
Those who sink under it into damnation, however, are not the Bloom’s or Dedalus’s but the thoughtless ones, the Mulligans, Punch Costellos and Father John Conmees. All take it up at breakfast, the thoughtful and thoughtless alike, the comparatively free and the wholly bound: “For by eating and drinking,” says Saint Augustine. . .
And when he then goes on to favour us with a lengthy quotation from the saint on gluttony, we may be permitted to wonder which should get the credit: Joyce, Saint Augustine, or human nature. After all, it is pretty clear that the writer and the moralist were, whether they liked it or not, forced to cover much the same ground.
Again, when he proceeds to classify various sins committed in the course of the day according to classifications used for the benefit of the faithful in the medieval treatise, Agenbite of Inwit, we may think the credit should go to the author of the treatise for inventing a nomenclature which stands up to such an extensive modern test, rather than to Joyce for cleverly constructing his book round it. The more so since, as Mr. Morse does not seem to be aware, the phrase “agenbite of inwit” did not appear in the first version of Ulysses at all.
Refused refreshment
In the same chapter Mr. Morse builds a great deal on an incident in the cabman’s shelter, where Stephen understandably (considering the night he has had) refuses any refreshment. Mr. Morse says:
As his intellectual independence dates from his refusal to enter the church, so his social independence dates from his refusal to enter the family. He rejects the inefficacious sacrament of the cabman’s shelter (“something in the shape of solid food. . . a bun or so it seemed” and “what was temporarily supposed to be coffee”). . .
This incident Mr. Morse turns into the climax of the book:
Dedalus does have many social sins on his conscience—almost the whole catalogue of Agenbite of Inwit—and he is absolved from them by refusing to take communion. That is the act of renunciation that purifies and frees the artist in him.
