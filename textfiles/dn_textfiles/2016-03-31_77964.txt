Former Sri Lanka captain Mahela Jayawardene to play for Somerset in T20 Blast

Somerset has signed former Sri Lanka captain Mahela Jayawardene for the majority of the 2016 NatWest T20 Blast campaign.
The 38-year-old, who scored almost 12,000 Test runs, will play in 12 of Somerset's 14 group games from June, and joins fellow star name Chris Gayle at Taunton.
Jayawardene, who retired from Test and T20 international cricket in 2014, said: "Somerset is a really good club with a long history and I hope that I can help bring success to the county.
"The club has a tradition of successful overseas players and I will be doing my best to join that illustrious list."
With Jayawardene and Gayle in their ranks, Somerset can lay claim to the two highest run scorers in ICC World Twenty20 competitions and director of cricket Matthew Maynard hopes that will draw the crowds this summer.
He said: "Mahela is a batsman of undoubted class who scores his runs all around the wicket. When a player of his experience and class becomes available, you have to snap them up. He is an experienced international captain and the squad will certainly benefit from having him around the dressing room.
"He is a true professional and will have a major influence both on and off the field for us during the NatWest T20 Blast campaign. To have the top two run scorers in the history of the ICC World T20 walking out in to the middle at Taunton is something that I hope the members and supporters will be looking forward to."(talksport.com)
