Here’s Brazil’s  sand king!

For 22-years beach monarch Marcio Mizael Matolias has avoided high rents in an upscale district of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil by living in a sand castle. But his unusual home has not stopped the 44-year-old, known affectionately by locals as ‘The King’ from pursuing his three passions: reading, golf and fishing.
Matolias has no trouble putting on a regal air and happy to pose on his throne in front of his castle, scepter in hand. However, unlike other monarchs, ‘King Marcio’ is personally responsible for conducting repairs to his palace, whether it’s the dungeons or a door.
He also has to constantly water his home to keep it from collapsing, Lavoixdunord.fr. reports.
Despite this, Matolias says he would not have it any other way.
He said: “I grew up in the Bay of Guanabara, I always lived on the beach. People pay exorbitant rents to live in front of the sea, I do not have bills and here I have a good life.”
While grandiose on the outside and with views of the pricy beach area, his house is just three square metres and full of books.
Matolias, who is single and childless said there is just one drawback to his peaceful existence: “The sand holds all the heat, so sometimes at night I can not sleep here, I’ll spend the night at a friend’s house, but I prefer it here even if I have to lie outside by the sea,” he said.
