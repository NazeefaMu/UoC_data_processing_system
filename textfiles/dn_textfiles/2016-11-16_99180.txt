Before the break

A Sri Lankan couple, Mr and Mrs Fernando, living in England for the past 30 years have undergone many hardships while helping family and friends. An unbelievable fortune unexpectedly falls on to their lap. How much money affects and shapes lives of common folk is revealed through the drama ‘Saadaya Maray Salli Hamaray’ –While the cash flowed, the party was perfect!
This play is enriched more by laughable contexts created through situations faced by people rather than laughing at the mental and physical incapacities of people.
Saadaya Maray – Salli Hamaray too carries such laughable humor.
