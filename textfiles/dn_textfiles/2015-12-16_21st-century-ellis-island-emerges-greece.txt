A 21st-century Ellis Island emerges in Greece

GREECE: With its aqua-blue waters, olive-tree-studded hills and well-preserved ancient ruins, this jewel in the Aegean Sea can hardly be compared to an island built of landfill in the mouth of New York Harbor.
Yet in a year of unparalleled migration to Europe, Lesbos has been transformed from a quietly sublime slice of paradise to a modern-day Ellis Island. It's the first port of call for a multiethnic, multinational tide of humanity seeking relief from war, persecution and poverty - the funnel through which thousands pass daily in search of a better life.
In recent months, the extraordinary pace of landings here has rivaled the historic peaks on the island that for decades formed the main gateway to the United States and that is still known worldwide as a byword for immigration.
But unlike Ellis Island, which was developed by the U.S. government specifically to process new arrivals, Lesbos's role has emerged largely by happenstance. The solutions to the crisis are a patchwork thrown together by aid organizations, volunteers and local authorities, with comparatively little evidence of help from the Greek government or the European Union.
"Who's in charge?" said Lani Fortier, who leads the International Rescue Committee's efforts in Lesbos. "There's no answer."
Despite recent improvements that have calmed a situation once defined by chaos and squalor, the infrastructure here for welcoming, screening and registering people on their way into Europe remains inadequate given expectations of another surge in numbers come spring.
Lesbos's emergence as a global migration centre, officials here say, was no short-term anomaly.
"This will continue for another two or three years - at least," said Marios Andriotios, spokesman for a beleaguered municipal government that has been crying out for help for much of this year. "We didn't choose to be a hot spot in this crisis. The smugglers chose Lesbos." Of the nearly 1 million refugees and migrants who have arrived in Europe by sea this year, 800,000 have come through the Greek islands. More than half of those have landed on Lesbos. That compares with just over 1 million arrivals during Ellis Island's busiest year, 1907.
