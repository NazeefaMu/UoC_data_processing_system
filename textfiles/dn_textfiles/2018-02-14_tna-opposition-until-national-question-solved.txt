TNA in opposition until national question is solved

The Tamil National Alliance (TNA) stated that they will not extend their support to the government until they find solutions to the national question.
MP M. A. Sumanthiran, in an interview with a Tamil website, said that the TNA would continue to be in the opposition and lend their support to any government that takes measures to solve the problems faced by the Tamil community.
