Mercedes-Benz takes  chequered flag in 2016

Mercedes-Benz was more successful than ever in the year 2016: The Stuttgart-based premium brand with the three-pointed star increased its unit sales by 11.3% and delivered 2,083,888 vehicles to customers all over the world. This means not only that Mercedes-Benz grew worldwide faster than its German competitors, but also that it delivered the most cars in the premium segment overtaking BMW after a decade.
Dr Dieter Zetsche, Chairman of the Board of Management of Daimler AG and Head of Mercedes-Benz Cars: “2016 was the most successful year for Mercedes-Benz in the history of the company, and the sixth record year in succession. With new cars with pioneering design that inspire our customers and with particularly strong growth, above all in China and Europe, we have climbed to the top of the premium segment. And we are accelerating further - with new technologies, products and services.”
The model portfolio of Mercedes-Benz with the sub-brands Mercedes-AMG and Mercedes-Maybach is bigger and more diverse than ever before. And the plug-in-hybrid initiative is in full swing: with eight models, Mercedes-Benz offers the widest range in the premium segment.
Daimler's Mercedes-Benz leaped to first place in the global luxury-auto sales race last year. It was the first time since 2005 that Mercedes outsold the BMW brand globally, the fruit of heavy recent investment, a revamped lineup and shakeup of its China business. Volkswagen's Audi unit remained third on the podium. Still, buoyant demand in China helped all three of the German manufacturers to new sales records.
Mercedes sold 2,083,888 units, which is 11,3% above previous year. Every single month in 2016 was a record month for Mercedes-Benz sales - December was the 46th record month in a row. All regions contributed to the growth, spearheaded by China (+28%) and Western Europe (+18%) with very dynamic market development. Mercedes-Benz is leading the premium segment on a world level by far with 80,000 units ahead of BMW and more than 210,000 units ahead of Audi.
Many markets conquered or defended the leading position: USA, Germany, Canada, Taiwan, Italy, Denmark, Czech Republic, Greece, Japan, Australia, Hungary, South Korea, the Southeast Asian Hubs and many other markets including Sri Lanka.
Commenting on the achievement of Mercedes-Benz, Mr Ranjith Pandithage (Chairman / Managing Director of Diesel & Motor Engineering PLC) mentioned “As the only authorized distributor for Mercedes-Benz in Sri Lanka and probably as the oldest authorized distributor for Mercedes-Benz in the region, we are very proud of this achievement.
Mercedes-Benz from its introduction to Sri Lanka more than 7 decades ago, has been successful in maintaining its leadership in the luxury car market. Mercedes-Benz yet again proved their dominance in 2016 as the only luxury brand having the technology to compete in Formula 1, and keep winning the Constructor's title and the Driver's title again and again for consecutive years.”
