Temple Trees, not a house of ‘rock n roll’  - UNP MP Jayampathi Jayasinghe

Senior Constitutional Lawyer turned United National Party (UNP) MP Jayampathi Jayasinghe yesterday said he did not think that Temple Trees has become a house of ‘rock n roll’ for UNP MPs. Jayasinghe said this responding to a question by us about the developments at the Temple Trees premises with recent video clips showing former UNP ministers and MPs in a frolicking transition, singing and swaying to typical “bajaw music,” whether he thought that Temple Trees was becoming “ some kind of UNP genre house of rock n’ roll. “I don’t think Temple Trees is a house of rock n roll,” said Jayasinghe.
Asked what he thought it was, the senior lawyer said, “ I don’t know.”
