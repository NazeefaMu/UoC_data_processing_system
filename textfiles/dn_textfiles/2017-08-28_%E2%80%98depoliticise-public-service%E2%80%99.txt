‘Depoliticise public service’

Abolition of politically driven trade unions and fencing political appointments in the government sector are prerequisites for an independent public service, Government and Provincial Government Trade Union Federation (GPGTUF) points out.
In a letter to President Maithripala Sirisena, GPGTUF General Secretary Ajith K. Tilakaratne said public servants should be freed from political influences and be given opportunity to act independently.
The GPGTUF proposes that it is time to establish a solid framework to make public service an independent entity. The political influence over government service deters 1.5 million public servants from executing their responsibilities independently, the GPGTUF observes.
It also holds political appointments and politically driven trade unions responsible for the general public’s lack of respect towards government service.
The GPGTUF proposes to limit recruitments to the government service via competitive exams only, in order to prevent political appointments. It also highlights the importance of eliminating politically driven trade unions.
Numerous conflicts within a government institution between trade unions holding different political views have a negative impact on the service provided to the public by that institution, the GPGTUF appoints out.
“All politically motivated trade unions should be eliminated.
“It is incorrect to allow politically driven trade unions to distort the government service.
“It would consequently endanger the public trust towards the government,” the letter reads.
