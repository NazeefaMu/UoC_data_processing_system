Web-based map to identify lands for investments

The Survey Department, on a request by the Central Programme Management Unit of the Ministry of National Policies and Economic Affairs of which Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe is Minister, has taken initiatives to establish a comprehensive database that indicates all major reserves in one web-based map which allows investors to identify suitable available lands for their investments.Unavailability of a comprehensive map that indicated land reserves such as forest reserves, wildlife reserves, riverine reserves, coastal reserves etc. is one of the most unfavorable factors that affect the investor attraction of the country.
Hence, it is considered as a major responsibility of the government to provide a conducive environment that attracts more investors to establish in Sri Lanka while minimizing the hurdles that prevent investors to invest in Sri Lanka.
The map database includes the information provided by regulators of state-owned lands such as the Department of Wildlife, Department of Forest Department and Coast Conservation Department etc.
The web address www.survey.gov.lk/nsdi/lis/index_cad.php allows users to search locations visually based on the map, search locations by uploading known GPS location and input the name of a location to find it on the map. By providing this information on state owned lands, investors could find details of suitable lands before deciding on the location for investment projects in order to prevent unnecessary delays.
