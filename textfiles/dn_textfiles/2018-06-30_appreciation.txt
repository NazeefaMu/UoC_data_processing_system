[Appreciation]

Somaweera Senanayaka, a literary and media genius
It is with profound sorrow that I write an appreciation of a simple, but great personage, who left this world on June 9, 2018. His parting is a loss of a ‘Kalyana Mitta, a congenial companion to me.
Many articles were written about him in almost all newspapers and portrayed in the electronic media illuminating vivid achievements of this personality. His contributions as a journalist, short story writer, teledrama and film script writer, editor of newspapers and magazines and as a novelist are a testimony to his versatility.
The distinction of his writings were for people of all walks of life mainly focusing the society, from children to adults guiding them in the right path with his deep knowledge in the Buddhist way of life inherited from his father and grandfather.
One interesting incident in is life is that at the tender age, he was trained to carry the 'Jathaka Poth Vahanse’, the story book of past births of the Buddha on his head clasping the same with both hands in a difficult terrain to the Temple.
It was duty of young Somaweera to recite the stories aloud to the village folk men, women young and old who gathered at the temple to listen to his recitals in a loud and melodious voice. This devotion and dedication he evinced for Buddhism from his young days blossomed into full stature until his demise.
One of the main themes in his writings were to bring some morals to families and mend the disintegrated families for harmonious living.
The ‘Doo Daruwo’ teledrama and ‘Eka Gei Minissu’, the latest short teledrama where he highlighted the role of a mother who strived hard to raise the family, where children were preoccupied with their own obsessions.
Although he earned many accolades and encomiums at prestigious audiences, he never lost his touch with the Welfare, Educational, Cultural and Religious activities of the locality which he adopted for living.
Being a distinguished member of the Boralesgamuwa Welfare Society formed over three decades ago, the Senanayaka name as a house hold name of fame with highlights in the press and electronic media regarding the teledramas and films produced by him, was boost to society.
Somaweera Senenayaka as a mentor helped to compile a book about the village of Boralesgamuwa.
‘Boralesgamuwa Udanaya’ was produced with his able guidance under a pool of resourceful academic achievers like Prof. W. N. Wilson of the University of Colombo, educationist W. B. P. Boteju and a host of other professionals who adorn Boralesgamuwa.
Being encouraged with the launch of ‘Boralesgamuwa Udanaya’ and the response received, another book to highlight the transformation of Boralesgamuwa to the present day Urban status was tasked to Prof. Wilson to edit the ‘Pibidena Boralesgamuwa’ with the acumen of Senanayaka always at his disposal.
Senanayaka always referred to Boralesgamuwa as ‘Pathirupa Desa’, a congenial place to live in. It may be that a person with a fascination for people and for the natural, historical and religious places like Bellanvila Raja Maha Viharaya Pepiliyana Sunethra Maha Devi Raja Maha Pirivena and Vapikarama temple, I together the charm of the lakes, Weras Ganga, the Attidiya Birds Sanctuary would have conceived in his mind to come to this view. It is also a complement of the highest respect a person of his caliber can bestow on a place where he chose to adopt for living.
His services to schoolchildren specially in the area where teenagers who relished to listen to his talks delivered in his inimitable style captivating their attention spoke volumes of his ability at addressing people at large, apart from his prowess in writing.
Until his demise he closely associated with the Vapikarama, a temple by the lake and he compiled an academic digest called ‘Weva Thera Saasadu Ananda,’ an eulogy of Ven Ponnilawa Rathanapala Thera, Viharadhikari of Vapikaramaya Temple who dedicate with untiring sacrifice to educate and bring up nearly 30 Samanera bhikkus with able assistance of few young Upasampada Bikkus.
Senanayaka frequently attended the Dayaka Sabha meetings in which he was the Lay Patron.
I recall with grief the irreparable loss to our Cultural and Educational Foundation in which he was the first Lay Patron. Late Ven Prof. Bellanvila Wimalaratna Thera was the Clergy Patron of the Foundation and was a beacon of light to our foundation until his passing away.
I console that he took life in good spirit with his unshaken faith of impermanence of all ‘Sanskara Dathu’ all living beings and thing as preached by the Buddha.
May he attain the Supreme Bliss of
Nirvana!
