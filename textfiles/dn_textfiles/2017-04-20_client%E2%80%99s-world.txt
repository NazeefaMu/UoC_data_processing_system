Client’s world!

Today Archt. Vajira Wickramasingha speaks to Archworld about the importance of seeing the world through the eyes of the client before deciding on architectural plans.
“In my view architecture is a way of life. Architect has to understand the client’s lifestyle completely before attempting the design. Once it is understood, the architect has to imagine himself as the client and live in the building while designing the spaces,” said Wickramasingha. We are indeed blessed with sunshine and wind. But while designing we have to be mindful that western sun is not always a blessing.
“If we provide glass facades or very large windows exposed to the western sun in order to get sunlight in, it will bring in unbearable amount of heat as well. My view is that sunlight should be taken into a building very carefully without disturbing the comfort level of its inhabitants,” pointed out Wickramasingha. Providing cross ventilation by taking the wind in could make a building very comfortable in a tropical country.

“But we have to be mindful again of the monsoon rain. While wind can make the building very comfortable during the dry season, rain water can beat in during rainy season wetting the entire space. If we use sunlight and wind with due care in our designs, we can create beautiful and comfortable spaces,” stated Wickramasingha.
Colours
Colours can have an amazing effect on anything.

“In a tropical country as ours we can draw into the building from the outside by creating openings and visually connecting the spaces. This can bring in all the colors created by mother-nature into the building with the beautiful sounds of the birds together with sunshine and wind.
I prefer to hide or blend my buildings in the natural environment. However using color depends on how I understand the client. If it is a retail shop I may use vibrant colors. If it is a home for a client who has had a very busy day, I may go for calm and soothing colors,” explained Wickramasingha
Plant, flowers and fruits can be beautiful things but still one must take precautions.
“This again could be another dream of all architects. The decision depends again on how practical it is. If the plot is very small the roots can damage the foundation. Even in a small site if it is a valuable and beautiful tree, precautions can be taken to preserve it, if client can afford to spend an additional cost on the foundation,” cautioned Wickramasingha
Possibilities
Truly the possibilities of architecture are mind boggling!
“I have realized that playing with light and shade, solids and voids, makes a building interesting and exiting,” said Wickramasingha
The architect and client must see eye to eye. The architect must see the client clearly. “I advice my students always to understand the life style of the client. Understand his problems, likes and dislikes etc .We are only designers. The client will have to live in the space that we create for him. Imagine yourself as the client. Imagine yourself living in that created space. Discuss with your client about the created spaces. Final design outcome should make your client happy and comfortable,” informed Wickramasingha
Buildings can also create a sense of nostalgia. Houses, factories, hotels and other buildings are all part of history in many ways.
“Decaying of buildings with time is inevitable. Some buildings are worth restoring. Some are not. The issue has to be addressed case by case. When old buildings are renovated I believe that we should not make any changes in facades. Material used should belong to the same era. Thereby the future generation too will be able to read the era of these buildings. It should take the form of restoration rather than renovation,” elucidated Wickramasingha
Imagination matters
As mentioned earlier, it is all about imagination - seeing through the eyes of the client by picturing oneself in the buildings.
“I remain a shadow and the character of my client becomes prominent in my buildings. Architecture will always relate with time. Once the character of the client is understood and a building is designed accordingly it will be a joy for the client to live in that building. While designing, the architect will imagine living in the building. He will foresee all the problems that will arise. Solutions are given in the design itself, thus the building becomes practical and logical. Regulations are made for the benefit of the people and therefore, a good designer will not violate them,” explained Wickramasingha
Green building concept is the solution to environmental and climatic crisis.

“Urban crisis and financial crisis, in an architectural point of view is based on a social problem. People who seek employment in cities increase the density of the population. This population is basically divided according to their income level - low income, middle income and high income groups.
The increased population will demand for facilities such as education, health, residencies according to their income level. Thus the need of buildings will arise. With the scarcity of land, final outcome will be an increased number of high rises and shanties. Location of industries in rural areas is the long-term solution for this issue,” pointed out Wickramasingha
Spiritual architecture derives with devotion and faith. People need such spaces to get relieved of stress.
“Taking time off to speak to god, to worship the Buddha or to meditate will help people calm their emotions. Therefore it is an essential social need to create such buildings or spaces. My very first building was a shrine room (Budhu Medura) for Sirimavo Bandaranaike Vidyalaya Colombo 7. Second experience was improvements to Bo-Maluwe at my alma mater -Visakha Vidyalaya Colombo 4,” summed up Wickramasingha
