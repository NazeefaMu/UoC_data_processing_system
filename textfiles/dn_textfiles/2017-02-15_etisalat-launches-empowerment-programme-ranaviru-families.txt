Etisalat launches empowerment programme for Ranaviru families

The Ranaviru Sewa Authority under the directive of the State Minister of Defence and the collaborative effort of the Chief Minister of Eastern Province recently launched an empowerment and grant programme for the Ranaviru community.
Ranaviru communities from Batticaloa and Ampara District received grants at a ceremony held at the Provincial Secretariat Office in Batticaloa last month.
Four hundred and twenty five Ranaviru children, 75 war orphans and displaced children received; school bags, school supplies and scholarships. Etisalat Lanka supported the programme with their generous contributions, forging their brand vision of enriching the lives of Sri Lankan people beyond connectivity.
While other state and private associations equally contributed towards the programme; clergy from inter-religious faiths, officials from state departments, Tri Forces and the Police assisted to organise and execute the project.
The programme envisions on promoting peaceful coexistence and reconciliation among war affected communities by empowering the youngsters to create a better future for them.
