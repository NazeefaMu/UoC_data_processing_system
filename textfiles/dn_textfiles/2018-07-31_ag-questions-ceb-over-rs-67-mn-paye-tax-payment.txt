AG questions CEB over Rs. 6.7 mn PAYE tax payment

Damning revelations have surfaced in a letter from the Auditor General’s Department addressed to the Ceylon Electricity Board, calling for clarification on how the utility provider paid Rs. 6.7 million as PAYE tax on behalf of its employees.
The letter, which Daily News is in receipt of, cites that according to the Department of Public Enterprise Circular No 3/2016 dated 29th April 2016, the PAYE tax of employees of public enterprises such as the CEB should be deducted from their salaries and directly deposited to the Inland Revenue Department.
The letter questions CEB’s transaction of Rs. 678, 508, 227 which was the PAYE tax for 2017, but instead of it being deducted from employees salaries, it had been paid directly by the utility provider. The payment has been denoted as an Expense of the CEB.
“It has been observed that the payment is an illegal transaction,” the letter signed on behalf of the Auditor General’s Department has called for a clarification from the CEB.
