Thomson forces global race into thrilling finish

Les Sables-d’Olonne: Alex Thomson forced himself to within 40 nautical miles of Vendee Globe solo-round-the-world race leader Armel Le Cleac’h as they head toward the finish on Thursday.
The 42-year-old Welshman is bidding to become the first non-French winner of the gruelling non-stop race which started in Les Sables d’Olonne on France’s Atlantic coast on November 6.
Thomson, on Hugo Boss, made up 30 nautical miles on Tuesday but his pace slowed during the night leaving his French rival, on Banque Populaire, still in the lead and favourite to cross the line first on Thursday.
Both had to sail past Les Sable d’Olonne toward the English Channel to get a favourable wind to bring them back down the coast faster to the finish line. Their gamble will be to see who turns first to catch the wind.
“Tell him to stay behind,” Le Cleac’h told a French Navy helicopter that flew over the Frenchman’s boat and asked whether he had a message for Thomson.
Some 300,000 people packed Les Sables d’Olonne and the nearby coast when the race started with 29 competitors. With the stakes high for the two leaders, big crowds are already gathering in the town for the return.
The winner is heading for a record time. A finish before 1202 GMT on Thursday would mean a circumnavigation in 74 days, four fewer than the record held by Francois Gabart since his win in 2013.
Le Cleac’h was beaten into second place for the last two Vendee Globe races. Thomson, whose team is based in Gosport on the south coast of England, was third last time, but abandoned in 2004 and 2008. The Briton’s support team and family gathered at in the Galway restaurant in the French port on Tuesday night. All shouted for joy when the night rankings indicated Thomson had cut Le Cleac’h’s lead again.
Third placed Jeremie Beyou is only expected in port on Monday. AFP
