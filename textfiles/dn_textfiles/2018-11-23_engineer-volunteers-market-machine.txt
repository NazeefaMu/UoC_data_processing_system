Student builds aquatic weed harvester
Engineer volunteers  to market machine

Following an article published in the Daily News about a student at the Thambuttegama Central College who had made several innovative equipment, including an aquatic weed harvester to collect water hyacinths spreading in tanks, an engineer had volunteered to assist the youth to sell his machines.
Hence, Ashoka Kumara of Kurana, Negombo, who is employed as a Project Engineer of a number of hotels in Negombo, promised to purchase the first aquatic weed harvester built by the 18-year-old inventor W.M. Harshaka Prabath Darmapala. He said he would find more buyers as well.
Kumara visited the youth at his residence, yesterday. He said the hotels that he was employed at were located near lagoons overrun by aquatic plants, and added that it was a hindrance to the tourism industry. He said that machines in the market cost more than Rs.9 million.
"As they were costly, I employed several people to remove the weeds, but it had also affected the industry as the workers were loitering," Kumara said, "Hence, when I read the article that appeared in the Daily News on October 31, I thought of meeting Darmapala."
The engineer said that the machine was relatively cheap and was meant for fresh water sources. He said that there were some modifications that were needed to be done before it could be used, and added that the young inventor was keen to make the required changes.
Darmapala's aquatic weed harvester could reach any part of the tank easily and collect 120 kilograms of water hyacinth in an hour. The machine can also store 30kg of water hyacinth and consumes only a half-a-litre of petrol per hour.
The student had also invented another machine to turn water hyacinths into compost. Furthermore, among his many other inventions is one that could protect houses from lightning strikes. Darmapala's Engineering Technology teacher is S.M. Nalinda Sampath.
