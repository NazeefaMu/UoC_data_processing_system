Villagers demand protection against wild elephants

It was brought to the notice of the officials in Ampara District that wild elephants have found their way interior to the villagers of Thirukkovil Irakkamam, Ampara, Valathapiddy, Kuduvil, Dheegawappiya, Nintavur, Pottuvil, Akkaraipattu, Addalaichenai and Alayadivembu. Residents in these areas live in fear.
The standing crop of paddy, home gardens and other arable crops have been badly damaged. As a result, the daily income of the people has reduced.
Wild elephants have entered the premises of a farmer and caused damage to paddy bags stocked in the verandah of the house, household goods and the bounty parapet walls.
Some wild elephants have entered Sambunagar and Meelath Nagar in Addalaichenai DS Division and damaged the standing crops and up- rooted grown plants recently. The people in these areas have found shelter in other places to spend their nights. Schoolchildren are unable to concentrate on their studies. Repeated requests to higher authorities have proved futile. A protest was held recently by the villagers in the Thirukkovil DS division demanding protection from wild elephants.
