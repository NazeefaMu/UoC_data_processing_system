SC orders admission  of student to Royal

The Supreme Court has ruled that the interview panel of Royal College should have been mindful of the fact that it is the ambition of every parent to admit their child to a school of their choice.
‘They should have looked at the documents not in a stereo typed manner but in a reasonable manner of every child who come before them seeking admission to the school ‘. The Supreme Court made this direction to the Royal College principal and 12 other respondents who had violated the Fundamental Rights guaranteed under Article 12(1) of the constitution to Rohan Rahul Ayushaman of Bambalapitiya by refusing admission to grade one at Royal College Colombo 7.
The Supreme Court ordered the respondents to take steps to admit Rohana Rahul to Grade One or to the appropriate grade at Royal College, Colombo 7 from now on.
The Supreme Court three-judge-Bench comprising Justice Eva Wanasundara, Justice Nalin Perera and Vijith Malalgoda observed that the interview panel had failed to evaluate the documents submitted on behalf of the second petitioner and to allocate marks to him.
The Supreme Court maintained the panel had acted arbitrarily by deciding not to grant marks by considering the concept of residence in a very abstract manner.
They had failed to consider the documents submitted on behalf of the petitioner when the documents clearly establish the residence of the petitioner.
Senior Counsel Ian Fernando with Counsel Sumudu Ratnayake and Natasha Samarasinghe under the instructions of Pradeepa Siriwardena appeared for the petitioners.
