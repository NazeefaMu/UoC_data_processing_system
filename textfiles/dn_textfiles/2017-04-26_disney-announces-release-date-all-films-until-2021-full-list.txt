Disney announces release date of all films up until 2021 - the full list

 
Disney, who has announced release dates for a wide range of its upcoming films including Frozen 2 and Indiana Jones 5, confirmed that Colin Trevorrow's sequel will arrive 24 May 2019 - five months ahead of the usual December release which was when The Force Awakens hit screens in 2015.
This move, as well as the release of the untitled Han Solo anthology prequel an entire year before, sees the Star Wars franchise return to the month which saw the unveiling of George Lucas' prequels in 1999, 2002 and 2005.
Disney's other big May release is Avengers 4 which Zoe Saldana may or may not have revealed the title of at the European premiere of Guardians of the Galaxy Vol 2 earlier this week.
John Boyega, Daisy Ridley and Adam Driver are all expected to return for the trilogy-closer. Lucasfilm president Kathleen Kennedy recently shot down suggestion that Carrie Fisher, who died last year, will appear stating that all her filmed footage will be used for a posthumous appearance in The Last Jedi.
The only other film currently slated for the same date as Episode IX is Robert Downey Jr.'s untitled Doctor Dolittle reboot.
Episode VIII: The Last Jedi - which will see an expanded role for Mark Hamill's Luke Skywalker - will be released December 15, 2017.
