SL bowl; Gunathilaka, Jayasuriya debuts

Sri Lanka chose to bowl in the first ODI against West Indies, likely owing to a preference to chase in rain-affected games that may be subject to Duckworth-Lewis calculations. Rain delayed the start time by 80 minutes, but a full 50-overs-a-side match would nevertheless be played.
Two players debut for Sri Lanka. Left-hand batsman and offspin bowler Shehan Jayasuriya would play his first ODI, after having played a T20 international in August. Danushka Gunathilaka - an opening batsman by trade - would play his first international in any format. Wicketkeeper-batsman Dinesh Chandimal was suspended for this match for his part in an on-field altercation during the India Test series in August, and Kusal Perera would take the gloves in his stead.
Sri Lanka play two specialist spinners in Sachithra Senanayake and Ajantha Mendis, along with two frontline quicks in Suranga Lakmal and Lasith Malinga.
Sunil Narine returned to international cricket after a 14-month hiatus, which had partly been forced by problems with his action. West Indies opted for a pace-heavy attack, including Jerome Taylor, Andre Russell, Carlos Brathwaite and captain Jason Holder. Andre Fletcher would likely open the batting alongside Johnson Charles.
