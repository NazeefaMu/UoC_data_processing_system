‘Getabaru Raja Maha Viharaya tea ceremony  will be held annually’

 “The new tea ceremony held at the sacred Getabaru Raja Maha Viharaya in Kotapola will be an annual event,” Plantation Industries Minister Naveen Dissanayake said.
Tea producers offered a portion of the first tea they produced after the Sinhala New Year to the temple at the festival, which was organised for the first time in this regard.
The Minister was addressing the gathering after making his offerings to the sacred temple last morning accompanied by Law and Order and Southern Development Minister Sagala Rathnayake.
“Although 150 years have passed since the tea industry began in Sri Lanka, this is the first time that a ceremony like this is held. We should be thankful to Russia and China for purchasing more Ceylon tea as it has boosted the price of green tea to over Rs. 105 a kilo.
We hope that the price will go up to as much as Rs 150 per kilo within our tenure,” he said.
Minister Sagala Rathnayaka said it was imperative that all tea plantations older than 20 years be replanted to increase production.
“I do not use chemical fertilisers or pesticides in the sections I have replanted. Increasing the density of plants as recommended now, results in the automatic control of the growth of weeds. We should be able to add value to our produce. The price of tea fluctuates regularly and I believe that the present price will remain stable for some time,” he said.
A large number of producers of tea in the Galle and the Matara Districts reached the Getabaru Raja Maha Viharaya in a procession to take part in the festival.
The ceremony was organised by the Sri Lanka Tea Board as part of the 150th anniversary celebrations of Ceylon Tea. The first commercial tea plantation in the country was established in 1867.
