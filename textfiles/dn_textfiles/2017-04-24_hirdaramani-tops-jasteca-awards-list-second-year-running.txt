Hirdaramani tops JASTECA awards list for the second year running

Hirdaramani repeated its sterling performance at the JASTECA Awards held recently, topping the awards list for the second consecutive year. Sustaining its previous year's performance, Hirdaramani bagged a total of 06 awards at the recently concluded event, including 01 Gold Award, 01 Silver Award, 01 Bronze Award, 02 Merit Awards and 01 Certificate of Compliance Award.
The JASTECA awards are bestowed on companies on the basis of consistency and commendable levels of pursuing 5S principles. Hirdaramani's performance demonstrates that the group continues to excel in its journey towards a leaner, more efficient, and therefore, a more responsible and sustainable manufacturer.
Commenting on the win, Vinod Hirdaramani, Director of Hirdaramani said, “Congratulations to the teams from all the factories for their exceptional performance. None of this would have been possible without JASTECA who have been championing the 5S methodology in Sri Lanka. We are truly grateful to the team that has worked with us continuously over the years, sharing knowledge and advice and enabling us to truly reap the benefits of this methodology, going beyond a cleanliness tool to become a productivity tool. We are happy to be a part of driving this cultural change across our organizations and are grateful to JASTECA for their continued support and guidance. We look forward to developing our compliance further and to take the ideals of 5S and Kaizen to greater heights.”
Topping the Jasteca awards winners list for yet another year, six Hirdaramani factories were selected for the final round of audits. Further, the Group's Eheliyagoda, Vavuniya and Seethawaka factories were rewarded for their continued excellence by winning the Gold, Silver and Bronze awards respectively.
This award reflects the commitment and effort of all group associates across the winning companies. The companies have successfully converted the use of 5S from a cleanliness tool into a productivity driven tool. The pursuit of 5S and Kaizen requires the dedication of all associates, which gives rise to greater teamwork and an enhanced team spirit, thereby enriching the organizational culture and the way it does business.
Jasteca has played a major role in helping Hirdaramani succeed and remains engaged with the companies in providing necessary training and guidance in the 5S and Kaizen implementation.
