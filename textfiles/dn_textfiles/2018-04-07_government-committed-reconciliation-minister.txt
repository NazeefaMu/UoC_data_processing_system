Government committed to reconciliation - Minister

Education Minister Akila Viraj Kariyawasam said the government is committed to national reconciliation and mutual coexistence of all communities and religious groups in the country and to bring all the people together under a truly Sri Lankan identity.
"There is no religious division.We are moulding a new generation which will not consider communal or religious differences.Our circular will be changed to reflect the message of national reconciliation,” he added.
The country lost 30 years of development due to the conflict.If we did not have this war, we would have moved beyond Singapore and Malaysia.There are several organisations and political parties which propagate communal ideals.We should not let anyone engage in communal politics.
The country will suffer again if extremist ideas take hold.We should not let emotions to control ourselves, but we should rather use our intelligence when tackling incidents of this nature, he added. Post, Postal Services and Muslim Religious Affairs Minister M.H.A. Haleem said there should be a broad dialogue to eliminate the mistrust prevailing in various communal and religious groups.
The Minister was addressing the gathering at a ceremony to grant financial assistance to reconstruct 19 places of worship that were damaged following the recent incidents in the Kandy-Digana area recently.The Central Cultural Fund has provided financial aid and each religious place will receive Rs.100,000 under this programme.
