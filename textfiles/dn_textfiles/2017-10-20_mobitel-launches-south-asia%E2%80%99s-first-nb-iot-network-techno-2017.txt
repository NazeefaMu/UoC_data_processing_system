Mobitel launches South Asia’s first  NB-IoT Network at Techno 2017

Mobitel, Sri Lanka’s National Mobile Service Provider showcased the nascent NB-IoT technology (Narrow Band Internet of Things) for the first time in South Asia at the recently concluded Techno 2017 exhibition in Sri Lanka which took place from October 13-15.
Mobitel’s vibrant demonstration at Techno 2017 inspired all attendees of the exhibition to experience for themselves the NB-IoT technology as their technology of choice for Low Power Wide Area connectivity needs.
Mobitel showcased NB-IoT as a powerful technology in urban farming and home safety systems. Mobitel’s innovative deployment of NB-IoT interleaved on its 900MHz spectrum ensured an increase in seven times the typical mobile coverage, enabling its use for sensors deep within concrete structures or underground such as required for smart meters or disaster monitoring sensors.
Mobitel Chairman, P. G. Kumarasinghe Sirisena was proud that Mobitel had delivered real-life solutions to the often overlooked rural community of Sri Lanka. He cited Mobitel’s NB-IoT technology as a vital component in increasing the productivity of Sri Lanka’s overall output through simple low-cost automation solutions provided by the Mobitel Network.
 Mobitel Chief Executive Officer, Nalin Perera highlighted Mobitel’s emphasis on living up to its ‘We Care. Always.’ motto. He went on to say that the NB-IoT network roll-out reinforced the company’s vision to expand its IoT business on top of the already successful home automation solutions delivered through the X Station store. He concluded with a strong message to all the people of Sri Lanka saying ‘Mobitel NB-IoT is for everyone and is not a luxury product. As a company we are socially aware of our responsibilities and we continue to make investments that will bridge the digital divide between the urban and rural communities.
 Rasantha Hettithanthrige, Mobitel’s Senior General Manager - Engineering & Operations, noted the high enthusiasm & the knowledge of attendees at the exhibition judging by the interactive discussions between Mobitel’s Engineering team and the attendees of the exhibition. “I must credit our team on the delivery and public demonstration of Sri Lanka’s first NB-IoT network.”
