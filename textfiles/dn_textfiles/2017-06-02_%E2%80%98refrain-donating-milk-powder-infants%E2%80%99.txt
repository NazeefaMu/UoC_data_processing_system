‘Refrain from donating milk powder for infants’

No milk powder or infants' milk powder should be given to flood victim infants or children in welfare camps. Only breast milk should be given to them, Consultant doctors attached to the Family Health Bureau of the Health Ministry said.
Health authorities in charge of relevant welfare camps will make arrangements for infants and children who lost their mothers due to the disaster, they added.
Addressing a press conference held at the Health Education Bureau in Colombo yesterday, Consultant Community Physician Dr. Hiranya Jayawickrama said no milk powder should be given to children because it can lead to serious health complications such as diarrhea etc. Sometimes such diseases can kill infants. The best milk for all infants and children is breast milk. In additional, children above the age of six months can be given complimentary food, they said.
Prof. Pujitha Wickramasinghe attached to the Department of Pediatrics of the Faculty of Medicine in the Colombo University said there is a myth that mothers do not have breast milk when they are under stress.
“Mothers always have breast milk and they should feed infants and children. Mothers' nutritional needs should be fulfilled by giving them nutritious food,” the professor said.
The Consultant doctors appealed to the public not to collect, donate or distribute milk powder for the use of flood victim infants and children in welfare camps. It is causing harm to their health. They can be physically and mentally healthy with breast milk given to them by their mothers. Infants bellow the age of six months should be given only breast milk. Other children can be given breast milk with complementary food, doctors said.
