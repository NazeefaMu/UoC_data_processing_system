Postal strike hinders Grade 1 applications

The strike launched by postal employees since June 11 has caused inconvenience to parents hoping to admit their children to Grade One classes next year (2019).
Parents complained that since the closing date for next year's admissions is July 1, they are uncertain whether they could keep to the deadline due to postal and other delays caused by the strike.
Parents said they request education authorities to consider their plight and postpone the closing date for applications beyond July 1, to enable them to submit applications on time.
