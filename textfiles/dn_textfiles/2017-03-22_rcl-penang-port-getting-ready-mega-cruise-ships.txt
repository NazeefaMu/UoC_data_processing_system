RCL, Penang Port  getting ready for mega cruise ships

Cruise line operator Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd. (RCL) and Malaysia's Penang Port Sdn Bhd (PPSB) plan to upgrade the Swettenham Pier Cruise Terminal (SPCT) in Georgetown to accommodate berthing of larger cruise ships. Under a joint venture agreement, the parties said they would extend the existing berths to 688 metres from its current length of 400 metres, enabling the terminal to berth two mega cruise liners carrying over 4,900 passengers each.
The 40/60 joint venture, which will be jointly managed by both parties, with the majority stake held by PPSB, informed that the upgrades would also include spaces for tour buses to ease the flow of traffic in the areas around SPCT.
Additionally, the USD 35 million project will further focus on improving accessibility for the aged and physically challenged throughout the terminal from ship to shore, the parties said.
“This planned development has received unyielding support from both State and Federal government and associated government agencies including Tourism bodies, and will be a focal part of Malaysian Tourism EPP6 plan to create a Straits and Borneo Cruise Riviera,” Royal Caribbean Cruises said.
