Appreciates Govt’s efforts to bring perpetrators to book

The Free Meedia Movement (FMM) in a statement yesterday appreciated the efforts by the Government to take the perpetrators of the Keith Noyahr assault into custody.
Although it took some time for the arrest of Major Bulathwatte and two other Sergeants, the arrests have been hailed as a major breakthrough. The Free Media Movement further demanded the government to complete the investigations in an independent and impartial manner.
The statement further said after the abduction of Keith Noyahr who was a co-editor in ‘The Nation’ newspaper, media organisations acted immediately and demanded the then government to release him drawing the attention of the international community, thus compelling the perpetrators had abandoned him.
The statement also said that it was reported that the same Major of the Army Intelligence Unit who was arrested on February 18 had been allegedly accused for the assassination of Lasantha Wickramatunge of the Sunday leader and for the assault of Upali Thennakoon of the Rivira newspaper. According to the statement, it was also revealed that the Criminal Investigation Unit is prepared to arrest a few more suspects. It said further that with the continuous lobbying by the Free Media Movement and other media organisations, a mere commencement of an investigation is not adequate; the process of delivering justice for the killed, disappeared, assaulted journalists and destroyed media institutions in the recent past should be expedited. The Free Media Movement went on to say in its statement that without suspicious and disagreeable actions among the media fraternity, such as reinstating the army personnel who were accused and then bailed out for the alleged disappearance of Prageeth Eknaligoda, this investigation should be completed independently.
