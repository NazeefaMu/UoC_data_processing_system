‘President wants to scrap Executive Presidency’

President Maitripala Sirisena's stance is that the Executive Presidency should be abolished, Cabinet spokesman, Minister Rajitha Senaratne said yesterday.
The SLFP Central Committee, chaired by President Sirisena, in the meantime, had stated that it had passed the resolution to continue with the Executive Presidency and have President Sirisena to contest a second term.
“Though they have made that request, the President has not said yes," the minister said addressing the weekly cabinet briefing at the Government Information Department.
He said since 1994, all Presidents had promised to abolish the Executive Presidency and used that very promised to get into power, but due to various practical or personal constraints, failed to live up to it, he said.
“Either they didn’t have two thirds majority or didn’t want to do it. And given the war, there were practical issues of whether it was a wise decision to make. But after 2010, there has been no excuse to keep it. On January 8, we promised to abolish it. That is the mandate upon which is the government was formed," Minister Senaratne said.
