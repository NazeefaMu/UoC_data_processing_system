Bhikkhu Organisation against govt's plan to handover H'tota land to China

The Bhikkhu Organization for Securing National Resources in Hambantota, yesterday said that they were unmoved with the decision to counter the government's plan to hand over the Hambantota Port and its properties to China.
A member of the Bhikkhu organization, Ven. Beragama Wimalabuddhi Thera said some bhikkhus from Hambantota favouring Minister Sajith Premadasa, had claimed their support over the Hambantota project without being properly educated on the matter.
Ven. Beragama Wimalabuddhi Thera said the media briefing supporting the Hambantota project was sponsored by the government. He said that an inspection should be done as to who gave permission to hold such a briefing in Hambantota District Secretariat premises.
Ven. Pitagala Premaratana Thera, Secretary of the district Balamandala, pointed out that all Nayaka Theras of the Viharayas in Hambantota are against the Hambantota agreement.
"If the government does not reveal the truth behind this agreement to the people and do as they fancies, we are ready to opt for a suicide attack," Convenor of the Bhikkhu Organization, Palle Malala Weligaththa Raja Maha Viharaya Nayaka Thero Beragama Gnanathilaka said.
The Bhikkhu organization also said that they are pressing for a directive issued by the Sangha, against the government.
