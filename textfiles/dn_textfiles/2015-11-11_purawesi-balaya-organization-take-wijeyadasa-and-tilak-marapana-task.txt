Purawesi Balaya Organization take Wijeyadasa and Tilak Marapana to task

Ministers Wijeyadasa Rajapakhe and Tilak Marapana came under fire yesterday by the Purawesi Balaya Organization in view of their conduct over the Avant Garde issue.
Purawesi Balaya (People's Power) Convener Joseph Stalin said Justice Minister Rajapkshe and former Law and Order Minister Tilak Marapana have acted out of line and contradicted collective Cabinet responsibility as with their recent statements made about the Avant Garde floating armoury.
As with their statements, both Rajapakshe and Marapana intimated that there has been no evidence to pursue a case against the operations of Avant Garde.
“They have stated so amidst an ongoing Presidential probe on the Avant Garde armouries and its operations in Sri Lankan waters. Ministers Rajapakshe and Marapana have undermined an ongoing Presidential inquiry by way of their conduct,” said Stalin.
Besides, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe had said in Parliament in August that the Avant Garde ship did not possess the proper papers to anchor at the Galle harbour. He said that the Defence Ministry did not have any records of the details of the quantity of weapons therein, or about the countries to which they belonged.
“Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe says that a case cannot be filed against Avant Garde,” he explained, “ However, it is neither the job nor the decision of the Justice Minister to file legal action against Avant Garde.”
“He has no say in the matter. It is the the Attorney General's job to look into those possibilities as Minister Rajapakshe is well aware, ” he said.
Criticizing former Minister Tilak Marapana for stating that the Police created a scene in the Avant Garde incident to impress the current government, Stalin said, “ I wonder if he ever took this issue seriously. "We are talking about military hardware that was loaded on a ship that is anchored in our waters,”he added.
“The people of this country did not bring this government into power to follow a soft approach towards corruption or on the perpetrators of corruption,” he said.
“Deputy Solicitor General Wasantha Nawaratna had said that legal action can be instituted against Gotabhaya Rajapaksa, Damayanthi Jayaratna and Manjula Kumara Yapa in connection with the Avant Garde,” he said. “It is indeed upsetting to observe that ministers, such as Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe, are acting in this manner,” he added.
