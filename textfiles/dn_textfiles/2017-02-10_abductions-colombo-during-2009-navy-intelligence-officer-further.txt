Abductions in Colombo during 2009: Navy intelligence officer further remanded

Lieutenant Commander Dhammika Anil Mapa, a Navy Intelligence officer attached to the Welisara Navy camp arrested for allegedly abducting Vadivelu Pakkili Sami Loganathan, a resident of Kotahena in 2009, was yesterday ordered to be further remanded till by Colombo Additional Magistrate J. Trotsky.  The Additional Magistrate ordered the Prison Authorities that a special security arrangement be provided when the suspect being kept in the remand custody and taken to Courts.
The CID conducting investigations into an incident where several persons had been abducted by unidentified groups in Colombo and the surrounding areas in 2009 had informed Court at a previous occasion that former Navy Intelligence Director Rear Admiral Ananda Guruge is to be arrested over the disappearance of two individuals in Kotahena. The OIC of the CID’s Gang Robbery Unit-Inspector Nishantha Silva informed Court that former Navy Intelligence Director Ananda Guruge and Lieutenant Commander Sampath Dayananda, a former Navy intelligence officer attached to the Welisara Navy camp would be arrested soon regarding the investigations on the abductions and disappearances of Vadivelu Pakkili Sami Loganathan and Rathnasami Paramanandan.
Inspector Nishantha Silva informed Court that the van of Vadivelu Pakkili Sami Loganathan was found at the Welisara Navy Camp while being discarded and cut into 72 pieces.
However, President’s Counsel Anil Silva appearing for the suspect denied allegations leveled against his client but admitted the fact that the Navy Intelligence Unit had taken the concerned vehicle into their custody following a report that it contained bomb concealed and compelled to cut into pieces for the purpose of searching explosive substances.
The CID submitted to Court that there is no legal provision vested with the Navy to carry out such a step and informed Court that the Navy should have brought the matter to the attention of police and bomb disposal unit.
The CID informed Court they have recorded a statement from former Senior DIG Anura Senanayake in connection with two abductions that took place in 2009.
Meanwhile, defence counsel filed written submissions in Court seeking bail on behalf of the suspect.
Defence counsel told Court that the suspect cannot be charged for the offence of committing murder since there is no evidence so far to suggest that the abductees had been murdered by someone.
It is alleged the former Senior DIG covered up evidence into an incident in which two persons had been abducted by an unidentified group from the Kotahena and Wellawatte areas in 2009.
The Colombo Crimes Division initiated investigations into these abductions on the instructions of the IGP following a complaint by then Navy Commander Wasantha Karannagoda in 2009.
The CID also informed the court that 11 abducted individuals had been detained at the Trincomalee underground detention centre violating their basic human rights.
