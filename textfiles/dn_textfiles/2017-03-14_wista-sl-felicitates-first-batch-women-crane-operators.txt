WISTA SL felicitates first batch of  Women Crane Operators

In commemorating International Women’s day which fell on March 8, Women’s International Shipping and Trading Association (WISTA) Sri Lanka, in keeping with the 2017 universal theme “# be Bold for change”, organized an event at the Kingsbury Hotel to felicitate the first batch of women crane operators in the South Asian region.
The first batch was trained at the Mahapola Ports and Maritime Academy, under the leadership of the Arjuna Ranathunga, Minister of Ports and shipping Nishantha Muthuhettigama , Deputy Minister of Ports and shipping and Dammika Ranatunga, Chairman Sri Lanka Ports Authority.
The bold approach of these ladies; in taking up the challenge of stepping in to “a man’s world of terminal operation” is indeed a proud moment for all the females in the Maritime Industry.
This will no doubt foster greater economic empowerment opportunities for women. WISTA has equipped these Female Crane Operators with focused training and networking opportunities, to share their experience and build confidence to excel in this sphere. The champion of this initiative was none other than the Chief Training Manager, Eng. R Sepala.
WISTA Sri Lanka also hosted Dr. Cleopatra Doumbia-Henry, President of the World Maritime University at the event.
The commitment of the Ministry of Ports and Shipping and the Sri Lanka Ports Authority for women’s empowerment, equality and diversity in the Maritime Industry is very much appreciated by WISTA and is of the view that the industry should foster more conducive conditions for women to seek and grow in their employment.
The objectives of WISTA Sri Lanka is to include the recognition of women achievers within the relevant fields,creation of a forum to address industry related issues, to make representation to relevant authorities and develop close cooperation with relevant maritime organizations or associations locally and internationally. WISTA also supports and share experiences with regard to work-life balance for women.
