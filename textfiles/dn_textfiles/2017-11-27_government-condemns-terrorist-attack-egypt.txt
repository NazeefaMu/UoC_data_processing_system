Government condemns terrorist attack in Egypt

The Government on Saturday condemned the terrorist attack on worshippers at a mosque in the Sinai region of Egypt on Friday.
“Attacking those at prayer is an act of inexplicable brutality. The Government and people of Sri Lanka offer deepest condolences to the families of the victims, and wish those injured a speedy recovery,” a statement by the Foreign Affairs Ministry said.
“While expressing solidarity with the Government of Egypt at this time of national mourning, the Government of Sri Lanka urges the international community to join hands to find effective ways and means to combat terrorism in all its forms and manifestations,” the statement added.
The death toll in a bomb and gun attack on a Sufi mosque in northern Sinai has risen to 305, with 27 children among the dead, agency reports said quoting Egypt’s state prosecutor.
Another 128 people were wounded.
Between 25 and 30 armed men carried out the assault on the al Rawdah Sufi mosque in Bir al-Abe.
The attackers arrived in five SUVs and were armed with automatic machine guns, the statement said. They took position in front of the mosque and its entrances. The attackers had long beards and hair, were wearing military fatigues and were armed with heavy machine guns, agency reports said.
At least one of those who entered the mosque was carrying an ISIS flag. There has not yet been a claim of responsibility from ISIS or its affiliate in Egypt. The attack bears the hallmarks of a strike by ISIS, which maintains a foothold in the north of the Sinai Peninsula and inspires local Islamist extremist groups, despite the efforts of Egyptian security forces, the news reports added.
