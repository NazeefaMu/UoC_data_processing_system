Ford Motor India drives  into profit zone

Ford Motor’s Indian unit swung to profit in fiscal 2018 after reporting losses for almost a decade, as cost reduction efforts and improved capacity utilisation, after making the country an export base, started paying rich dividends.
Ford Motor India posted a profit of Rs 526 crore in fiscal 2018, compared with a loss of Rs 521 crore the previous year, it said in a filing with the Ministry of Corporate Affairs. The company that entered the Indian market in 1996 previously posted a profit  in 2009. The turnaround in the Indian operation happens at a critical time when the carmaker is battling a slow down in China and margin deterioration in its home market of the US.
The change has been triggered by adoption of what it called the Emerging Market Operating Model, which led to a structural cost reduction of more than 37% in the past few years, coupled with increased capacity utilisation.
. A 16% jump in export volumes to 1.8 lakh units, along with increased domestic volume, drove the company’s total sales growth to 15% in FY18 to 2.7 lakh units. Revenue for the year rose 23% to ‘22,049 crore, as against a 33% growth in fiscal 2017.
A five-year plan defined by the US-based automaker a couple of years back places significant emphasis on strong brands, right products, competitive costs and effective scale to boost its emerging market business.
To build brand, the company focussed on busting the feeling of high cost of ownership to bring in right products, suited to the requirements of Indian buyers with strong contribution from its local product development centre. In FY18, Ford claimed it had the youngest portfolio of products in the country which helped its domestic sales.
Ford also focussed on building competitive cost by using more locally sourced components, parts commonality and delivering effective scale by aligning production to demand and leveraging exports to driver capacity utilisation.
Localisation levels increased to more than 85% of components in FY18 from 75% a few years ago.
Ford India said it is committed to building a sustainable, profitable business in India, which continues to be one of the world’s fastest growing markets for passenger vehicles.
Reviewing the strong performance of FY18, the directors’ report filed with the ministry said the company was continuously pursuing the strategic objective, which contributed to improved business performance and turnaround in operations.
In order to accelerate cost reduction and rationalise the investment in new products, Ford entered into a memorandum of understanding in FY18 with Mahindra & Mahindra, which will allow the company to expand its product portfolio in the market at lower cost and through the partner’s strong local know-how. The deal will also help it reduce cost on parts sourcing. (The Economic Times)
