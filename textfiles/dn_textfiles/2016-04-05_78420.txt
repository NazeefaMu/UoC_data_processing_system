Local Authorities are essential for democracy: Musthapha

Provincial Councils and Local Government Minister Faiszer Musthapha said that it was his responsibility to ensure that delimitation is conducted properly. “Local Authorities are an essential component in democracy. As the Minister of Provincial Councils and Local Government, I am responsible to the country and the public to ensure that delimiting is conducted in a proper manner.”
He said all of the political parties had complained that there were issues with delimiting and said an election cannot be held without the issued being resolved. “Three villages in Vavuniya lost their right to vote under the previous delimitation. That is not good. My responsibility is to do this job properly in a manner in which none of the races or areas will experience any injustice. For that we need a reasonable time period. So I would like to ask that members of PSs endure these circumstances for some time.”
He was speaking at the opening of a multi-purpose building for the Aranayeka Pradeshiya Sabha today. He also said the SLFP will not be brought down by hooting. “Not even the assassination of Bandaranaike spelled the end of the party,” he said.
