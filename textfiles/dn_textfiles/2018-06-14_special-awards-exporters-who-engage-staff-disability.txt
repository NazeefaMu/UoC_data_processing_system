Special Awards for Exporters who engage staff with disability

The National Chamber of Exporters (NCE) is pleased to announce that the 26th Annual Export Awards event will be held on September 28, 2018 at the Hotel Shangri-La, Colombo. It will provide a great opportunity for the Exporter community to compete on a single platform under Extra-large, Large, Medium and Small categories to showcase their achievements by winning Gold, Silver, and Bronze awards.
At the application launching ceremony held at the Hotel Galadari Colombo, Menaka Wanniarachchi Director Operations of the Chamber stated that The NCE Export Awards has been conducted continuously for the last 25 years without a break, and that the nation has witnessed an increased number of exporters participating this prestigious event.
She added that the NCE has introduced a Special Award for the first time, to recognize the importance and contribution to create an inclusive society through the inclusion of Persons with Disability, which is not only a national goal but a Sustainable Development goal recognized globally. Quoting a famous American politician Thomas Perez, She stated that “Employers have recognized for some time that it is smart business to have a diverse workforce - one in which many views are represented, and everyone’s talents are valued. Disability is part of diversity”.
Menaka stated that the NCE also adheres to the same perspective, along with the observation and careful understanding of the unemployment and underemployment trends prevailing among Persons with Disability, who are in the labour force, and as such the NCE has decided to introduce this new feature for the first time. Awards will be conferred to organizations which employ Persons with Disability, and who contribute towards the skills development and wellbeing of such persons.
According to the Director Operations, this special award will be awarded to encourage more export oriented companies to engage, and include disabled people in their respective organizations, whereby the chamber expects an increased number of applicants for future award events by many companies creating a benchmark for Sustainable Development of the disabled people in the country. This will not only add value to their triple bottom line, but will also contribute more towards the national economy.
