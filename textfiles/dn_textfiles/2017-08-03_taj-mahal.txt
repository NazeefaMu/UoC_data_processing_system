Taj Mahal

Ever wonder why the Taj Mahal is so white? The answer to that question is Makrana marble. The Taj Mahal has been constructed with the best quality of Makrana marble. Makrana is a place in the Indian state of Rajasthan which produces some of the finest stone in the world. The quality of the stone available at that time was exquisite, and the master artisans polished the stone to perfection. This has made the Taj Mahal look so brilliantly white over the centuries. However, the recent development of industries around the Taj Mahal has caused the marble to deteriorate. This has made the government set up a protective zone around the Taj to help preserve the glory of the Taj Mahal as a national monument.
Framed Views
The Taj Mahal is one of the most photographed locations in the world. Did you ever wonder why? The answer is staring at us in the face. The architects of the Taj framed the views. Entrances, exits, and spaces were designed in a manner which framed the Taj Mahal as seen in the images above. Rather than it being a coincidence, it was deliberately designed that way, thus, adding to the aesthetics of the building even more.
Hierarchy of Spaces
A clear hierarchy of spaces has set in the design of the Taj Mahal. The spaces transition from public to semi-private to private. Thus, the visitor enters into the Taj Mahal enclosure via the main entrance way (from the public to semi-public), moves through the gardens to arrive at the plinth. A flight of stairs helps the visitor transition onto the plinth and into the interior of the building (semi-private). The original transition was to be into the main underground vault wherein the coffers of the emperor and empress are located (it is the most private space in the entire complex). Thus, it is quite evident that the Mughals built into the Taj Mahal complex to have aclear hierarchy of spaces.
Religious Carvings and Calligraphy
The Taj is also famous for its many carvings. The carvings and calligraphy have been sculpted on the entrance ways, interiors, dome, etc. Master craftsmen such as Amanat Khan perfected the art of calligraphy and inscribed beautiful sayings such as “O Soul, thou art at rest. Return to the Lord at peace with Him, and He at peace with you.” into the entranceways.
The exquisite and intricate calligraphy and carvings add to the flavor of the monument even more. The engravings are mostly Islamic (verses from the Holy Quran) and are meant to spread the message of the prophet.
Use of Passive Cooling Techniques
The Taj Mahal uses a number of passive cooling techniques to keep the interiors light and airy.
Some of the passive cooling techniques used are jaalis (perforated wall panels which help in cooling the interiors), walls with high thermal mass, cross ventilation, the use of green spaces around the built form, etc. All these features help the building become cooler especially in the summer months.

One has to keep in mind that though these features have been incorporated into the design of the building, an emphasis has not been laid to incorporate more passive cooling features due to its function as a mausoleum.
Use of a Double Dome
The Taj Mahal incorporates in its design a double dome (as seen in the image above). The double dome is supposed to make the interiors of the building more comfortable and proportionate.
Most people who have been to the Taj are perplexed by this rather common question of why does the dome look taller from outside and relatively shorter from the inside. The answer is due to the double dome.
Thus, it is safe to say that the Taj, Mahal is one of the greatest buildings to have ever been built. The monument is a testament to the architectural, engineering and artistic know-how and skill of the Mughals. The Taj Mahal, thus, justifies its status of being one of the seven wonders of the world and a bit more.
