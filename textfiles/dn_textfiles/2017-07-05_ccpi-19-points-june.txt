CCPI up by 1.9 points in June

The Colombo Consumer Price Index (CCPI) tabulated by the Department of Census and Statistics (DCS) has increased by 1.9 index points in June 2017 compared to the month of May 2017.
The main reason to the increase in CCPI from May to June was due to the increases of Food and Nonalcoholic Beverages items by 1.46% and Non Food items by 0.16% respectively.
Increases in value change were reported for sea fish (0.71%), vegetables (0.41%), rice (0.23%), green chillies (0.15%), red onion (0.12%), potatoes (0.04%), chicken (0.03%), dried fish (0.02%) and garlic (0.02%) while decreases in value changes were reported for banana (0.15%), papaw (0.05%), coconut (0.02%), pineapple (0.01%) and mango (0.01%).
Among non food groups, value increases were reported for groups of ‘furnishing, household equipment and routing household maintenance’ (0.24%) and ‘transport’ (0.04%) while decreases in value change were reported for ‘health’ (0.09%), ‘housing, water, electricity, gas and other fuels’ (0.03%), clothing and foot wear (0.01%)’ groups.
The group of ‘Alcoholic Beverages and Tobacco’ showed an insignificant value change while all other groups remain unchanged during the period.
The consumer basket includes 392 items which represent the typical urban household consumption expenditure.
