Nepal players bailed in World Cup fixing case

KATHMANDU,TUESDAY: A court granted bail Tuesday to Nepal's national football captain and four other players charged with treason over alleged match-fixing in World Cup qualifiers, a lawyer for one of the defendants said.
“The Special Court has ordered the players to be released on bail,” said Nani Babu Budhathoki, representing former national footballer Bikash Singh Chhetri. All five players, including skipper Sagar Thapa and national goalkeeper Ritesh Thapa, have denied any involvement in match-fixing following their arrests last month in the capital.
Prosecutors have sought life sentences for the five, including defender Sandip Rai and coach Anjan KC, after they were charged on Sunday under a 1989 act against unlawfully jeopardising Nepal's sovereignty, integrity or national unity.
