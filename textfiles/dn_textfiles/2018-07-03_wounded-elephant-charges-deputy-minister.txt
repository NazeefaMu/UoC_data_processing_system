Wounded elephant charges at deputy minister

Deputy Wildlife Minister Palitha Thewarapperuma who went to check on an elephant who had sustained gunshot injuries, was charged at by the elephant for a distance of about 100 metres.
The incident took place near the Idda Pichcha Wewa area in Nawamillana, Dimbulagala, on June 30.
The deputy minister had been accompanied by the Aralaganwila Police OIC and a group of police officers and Weheragala Wildlife officers.
The Wildlife officers and police had fired into the air and stopped the elephant from causing any harm to the minister and had escorted him out of the jungle unharmed.
Speaking to the Daily News, Deputy Minister Thewarapperuma said, “The elephant, though injured, still tried to uphold his majesty and that’s why he chased us. Moreover, considering the harm done to him by humans, it is no surprise that he dislikes humans so much. We went back again on Sunday and examined the injuries on the elephant after sedating him and it was heart wrenching. The poor animal had a gaping gunshot wound on his left leg that was oozing out pus, as well as gunshot injuries on his chest and leg. He even had burn injuries on his head, possibly caused by being set on fire after acid or petrol or kerosene was poured on him. This animal is suffering. I don’t know if we can save it, but we will do our best.”
The deputy minister noted that the forest is polluted by the dumping of garbage which is consumed by wild animals, including the elephants. “We found an elephant who was struggling in pain and upon examining its excrement, I found that 99 percent of it was shopping bags. Imagine what is in this animal’s stomach. The wildlife in our country is being systematically killed off in the most brutal manner. I commenced this inspection tour on June 23 from Sooriyawewa. A mother elephant who was injured by a hakkapatas was suffering with her mouth severely injured and in spite of her pain, she was still feeding her calf. Eventually the mother elephant came towards the village and collapsed. We rescued the baby elephant and took it to safety, but the injuries on the mother elephant were too much and she eventually succumbed to her injuries,” explained Thewarapperuma.
The minister vowed that in spite of all the criticism, he would continue to do his best to save the wildlife assets of this country.
