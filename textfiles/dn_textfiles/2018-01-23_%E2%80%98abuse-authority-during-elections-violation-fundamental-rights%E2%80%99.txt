‘Abuse of authority during elections a violation of fundamental rights’

The Human Rights Commission of Sri Lanka (HRCSL), issuing directives to public officers on the Local Authorities Election – 2018, said abuse of authority and use of powers in a politically-partial manner, result in violation of fundamental rights, yesterday.
HRCSL Chairperson Dr. Deepika Udagama, issuing a press release, said the Commission would take steps to monitor the conduct of public officers in order to ensure that the forthcoming election is conducted freely and fairly. The release said the non-implementation of the law or the permitting of some political parties and groups to use public property and resources in violation of the law, is a violation of fundamental rights.
“In addition to state responsibility, officers responsible for such action/inaction would be held personally responsible for violations,” it added. “The right to vote has been declared a fundamental right by the Supreme Court of Sri Lanka. When an election takes place, all public officers are bound to ensure that the election takes place in conformity with the Constitution and prevailing laws. Public officers should conduct their official duties in compliance with such laws and act impartially,” the release added.
“The objective of the directives is to make public officers aware of the protection of fundamental rights during the election.
The HRCSL has sent these directives to all Ministries and Chief Secretaries of all Provincial Councils. The directives were also sent to Secretary to the President, Secretary to the Prime Minister, and the Election Commission,” the statement said.
