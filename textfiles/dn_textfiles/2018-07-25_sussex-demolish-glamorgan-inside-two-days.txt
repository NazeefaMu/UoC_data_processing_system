Sussex demolish Glamorgan inside two days

LONDON, Tuesday: Sussex pace pair Jofra Archer and Chris Jordan ripped through Glamorgan twice in two sessions, bringing their side victory by an innings and 154 runs.
Their consistent threat, backed up by Ollie Robinson and David Wiese, saw Glamorgan bowled out for just 85 and 88 in Hove.
It was Sussex’s fourth win of the season in their promotion challenge and Glamorgan’s fifth defeat.
Archer claimed eight wickets in the day, Jordan five, Robinson four and Wiese two as they never allowed the visitors the chance to get going.
Leicestershire cruised to a two-day win at Canterbury after Kent collapsed for the second time in the game.
Mohammad Abbas (4-55) bowled opener Daniel Bell-Drummond for a four-ball duck as the hosts’ second innings got off to a disastrous start. Sean Dickson steadied the ship with 59 but the home side struggled to 199 all out, a lead of just 74 runs.
Harry Dearden’s unbeaten 55 helped the visitors reach 76-0 in 15 overs to claim a 10-wicket victory.
Tom Latham hit a century but England all-rounder Ben Stokes was out for three as Durham made a steady start in reply to Gloucestershire’s 362.
Stokes had earlier finished with figures of 5-52 as the hosts added 42 to their overnight 315-7. Skipper Latham ended the day on 120 not out.
Warwickshire edged day two against Middlesex as Will Rhodes scored a century and Jeetan Patel took 4-38.
Resuming on 152-4, Rhodes batted through the innings and was last man out for 118 as Warwickshire scored 276 to put them ahead by 40 runs at Lord’s. The hosts slumped from 152-2 to 183-6 at the close, a lead of 143 runs.
Northants captain Alex Wakely scored a century as their match at Derbyshire remained in the balance after day two.
Resuming on 74-3, trailing by 186 runs, Wakely built a 120-run sixth-wicket partnership with Steven Crook (60) before being caught at slip for 106.
The hosts reached 147-4 in their second innings by close, a lead of 118 runs, with Wayne Madsen 52 not out.
Jamie Overton and Josh Davey took four wickets each as Somerset took charge on day two against Worcestershire.
The visitors were soon all out for 337 on the second morning at New Road, but then reduced Worcestershire to 82-5.
Surrey’s batsman piled the pressure on title rivals Nottinghamshire on day two of their Division One match.
Resuming on 223-1, Rory Burns (153) hit his third Championship ton of 2018 before Sam Curran (70) and Rikki Clarke put on 125 for the seventh wicket.
Clarke went for 111 as Billy Root (3-37) cleaned up the tail, with Surrey bowled out for 592, a lead of 382 runs. Notts reached 57-1 at stumps, still 325 runs behind.
