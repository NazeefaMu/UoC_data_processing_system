Common opposition MPs to take anti-SLFP government stance

SLFP Parliamentarians in the Common Opposition are planning to act as an anti-SLFP government group in the future. Discussions are underway among the MPs in this connection, reports said.
There are 51 MPs representing the Common Opposition in Parliament and of them, 41 are from the SLFP.
These SLFP Parliamentarians have planned to hold separate press conferences in the future. The first of these series is due to be held next week. They are also planning to get Kurunegala District Parliamentarian Mahinda Rajapaksa to attend the press conference.
MEP Leader Dinesh Gunawardena is acting as the leader of the Common Opposition. SLFP Parliamentarian Prasanna Ranatunge is acting as its convener. The Common Opposition also includes National Freedom Front Leader Wimal Weerawansa and Pivithuru Hela Urumaya Leader Udaya Gammanpila.
Kandy District Parliamentarian Keheliya Rambukwella when contacted said there is a request from people and party supporters for SLFP Parliamentarians to act as an anti-government group. They were prepared to take any action which would give priority to safeguard SLFP identity and cater to the request of party supporters.
