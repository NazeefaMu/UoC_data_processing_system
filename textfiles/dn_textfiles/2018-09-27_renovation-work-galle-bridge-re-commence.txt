Renovation work on Galle bridge to re-commence

Higher Education and Cultural Minister Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe instructed Road Development Authority officials to proceed with the restoration work on the ancient bridge near the Galle Railway Station without impairing its archeological and heritage value.
The minister went on a tour of the bridge on Tuesday to inspect the work in response to media reports alleging that repairs to this historical bridge is being carried out causing harm to its archeological value. Owing to the allegations, the bridge renovation work had been temporarily terminated pending further directives from the relevant authorities.
A group of officials and regional politicians including Home Affairs Minister Vajira Abeywardana , Archeology Director General Prof. P.B.Mandawala, Road Development Authority Chairman Kamal Amarasooriya, Southern Province Assistant Commissioner of the Archeology Department Wasantha Alahakoon, Galu Urumaya Foundation Project Officer Tharanga Liyanaarachchi and Road Development Authority Galle District Engineer K.Krishanthi joined the minister in his visit.
The extension of this bridge which reportedly belongs to the Dutch Period was planned in 2006 under the Colombo – Matara Highway broadening project.
This bridge is regarded as one of the oldest bridges in Sri Lanka with a stone plaque which contains Dutch characters together with the year 1768 engraved on it. Following the media reports over potential threat on the heritage value of the bridge the renovation work on it had been provisionally stopped.
