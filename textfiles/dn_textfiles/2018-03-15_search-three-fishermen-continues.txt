Search for three fishermen continues

Search operations are continuing to locate three fishermen who went missing due to the adverse weather that prevailed in the coastal areas of the country on Monday.
The three fishermen had set out to sea from Nayaru in Mullaitivu, despite the warning issued by the Meteorology Department.
Fisheries and Aquatic Resources Development Minister Mahinda Amaraweera has instructed relevant authorities to continue search operations to locate the three fishermen.
The Sri Lanka Navy and Sri Lanka Air Force are currently engaging in search operations and the Fishing Vessels Monitoring Centre of the Fisheries Ministry has also informed all ships to be on alert for these fishermen, Fisheries Ministry sources said.
According to ministry sources, more than 99 percent of fishermen had refrained from fishing due to the warning issued by the Met Department.
