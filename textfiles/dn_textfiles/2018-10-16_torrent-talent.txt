Torrent of talent

Janaka Palapathwala’s attitude and heart is as great and powerful as his singing. Within him is a wellspring of compassion. Melodies speaks to Palapathwala who uses his god given talent of singing for the pleasure of others and to serve others.
When god knitted him in his mother’s womb, he placed the gift of music within Palapathwala’s soul. He says this in his own words. He expresses this in his songs.
“If God Almighty has given me a talent, I believe that it is not only for my personal gain. I must utilize it for the benefit of society. My first charity was for Thalassemia patients. That was my decision when we organized the concert with Lions Club, in my 2014 concert. But in concerts afterward in Sri Lanka and overseas, the organizers arrive at the decision and I willingly oblige them. My concern always, is whether the charities go to deserving hands and it always has been. I wish to be of help to anyone in need and who is underprivileged, irrespective of my choice. Passions and talents are brought from birth I presume. So I would say, music was placed in me while I was in my mother’s womb,” explained Palapathawala.
Palapathwala’s pure talent and affability has endeared him to his fans, which is why they travel long distances to see and hear him perform. His next tour is in New Zealand, to name the cities, Auckland and Wellington. Then he is flying to United States for shows in Los Angeles, Las Vegas, San Francisco, Houston, Phoenix, New York and Washington DC.
“Usually every performance or concert is very memorable to me. But if you ask me to be précise I would say in the recent past, Melbourne Concert, Los Angeles Concert and the Toronto Concerts have been very outstanding. They became “Talk of the Town’’ shows. Some fans continued to see my concerts in other cities and states of the same tour, traveling hundreds of miles that gave me tremendous satisfaction,” said Palapathwala.
Palapathwala admires many great singers- Jim Reeves, Elvis Presley, Engelbert, Neil Diamond, Tom Jones, Perry Como, Demis Roussos, Faron Young, Nana Mouskouri, Dean Martin, would stand on top of the list. But there are many more that made an impression on his mind at such a tender age.
“If I say why, the answer could be described in two ways. One, because they don’t sing songs that everyone could sing easily. Two, these are the songs that penetrated my subconscious mind while I was sleeping as an infant. My father and mother always listened to the radio while sleeping as there was no television those days. In fact many people ask me why I have a big flair for the artists of my previous generation,” stated Palapathwala.
Palapathwala took a brief absence from the musical scene but returned in 2014. He started professional singing during 2001 – 2002. There onwards he focused on his business. However music is his calling in life. It is his destiny. It is his first love and he will never abandon this love of his - this wonderful creation that is music. In the international scene he has collaborated with Gary Ellis and Rob Ferdinander. In Sri Lanka he has worked with Kalashuree Harsha Markalande, Suresh Maliyadde, Danister Perera, Dinesh Subasinghe, Chandradasa Fernando, Amila Thenuwara, Sanath Sathishchandra, Thilak Dias and many more.
“I started professional singing in 2001-2002. Then in 2004 I left Sri Lanka for my business work. During this period I focused on my business. In an unknown land there would be no one to guide or support. So without taking risks, I totally focused on my business. But as I returned to Sri Lanka, I could not resist music which is my first love. So I had a mega concert in 2014, titled ‘It’s now or Never’’ with a 31 piece orchestra. Since then I am continuing the journey,” added Palapathwala.
Since 2014 he has done over a dozen tours. And things keep on getting better and better. Every tour holds a special place in his heart. This energy he has within him makes him deliver scintillating performances time and again making him look to the future with enthusiasm -Mostly Ballads, country, country and western and Rock and Roll.
“Utmost gratitude goes to my creator and my parents who brought me into this world implanting these abilities within me. Then comes my wife and my family for supporting and encouraging me. Then I want to thank all my music directors, song writers of my originals which I will release soon. I want to thank all the fellow musicians working with me and my promoters around the world. The media play a very major role when it comes to public figures. A big thank you to Gary Ellis for establishing my name in Australia and last but not least my fans,” points out Palapathwala.
His message to any young person who wants to do music is to discover your inner self and explore yourself. Decide what you are searching for.
“I would say, just follow your heart. Don’t seek short cuts. Identify self-talent first. Music alone is a very vast industry. So see first where you fit in, as a vocalist or an instrumentalist or a backup singer or song writer. Sing and play what you like and let the audience be the judge. Do not fall by trying to deliver what the audience wants, what you are not capable of,” said Palapathwala.
