Citizens' Mail

Why write off microfinance loans?
Over the weekend, there was a front-page news article indicating that the “Govt. is to rescue hundreds of families from microfinance debt trap”. According to the news item, the Government is to use taxpayers’ money to provide debt relief to families in the North, Eastern and North Central Provinces who have been affected. It also indicated the beneficiaries include women-headed households in 8 drought affected districts of the three provinces.
The non-performing microfinance loans in the North and East is not a recent phenomenon. During the three-decade conflict in the North and East since the formal financial institutions were unable to access them, this was fertile ground for international and local NGOs. This situation was further aggravated by the Tsunami in 2004. There were numerous grant programmes initiated by the international NGOs and donors and the North and East people got used to the generous grant schemes. After the cessation of hostilities, the government and the donors funded livelihood programmes to help them restart their economic activities. In the meantime, the informal and commercial microfinance companies entered the arena and started providing funds.
However, writing off loans closer to provincial and presidential elections and the selection of the provinces do not bode well for the microfinance industry. I recollect Dr. W. A. Wijewardane long years back mentioning that it’s not the funds allocated for writing off loans that are more damaging but the adverse impact on the credit culture created by such action.
We need to bear in mind the poor are not the rustic poor who lived a few decades ago. These people who live in rural areas are well connected with the rest of the world via mobile technology and have been corrupted by the system. Most of the young rural poor are dependent on their parents or the elderly population. Therefore, the practice of writing off loans by incumbent governments which were abandoned with the dawn of the 21st Century should not be introduced once again. It’s obvious these policy measures are geared towards obtaining political mileage and if it is inevitable need to be done with less or no fanfare to minimize the damage on the credit culture.
It’s also ironical that international financial institutions who have the leverage with the government do not caution them of these unsavoury practices. It is rather distressing to find that country is still using the financial sector in a primitive way to alleviate their own deficiencies.
Actually what the government is doing is bailing out the unscrupulous microfinance institutions with taxpayers’ money. It would be good to know what action would be taken against the institutions who have been engaging in reckless lending rather than cleaning their loan books. Rural poor will anyway bear the cost indirectly since this is funded by the budget, but they are not rational enough to understand it.
