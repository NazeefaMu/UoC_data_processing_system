INSEE Cement partners with PIM

INSEE Cement joined hands with the Postgraduate Institute of Management (PIM), Sri Lanka’s premier center of excellence in management education, to launch its first Executive Leadership Development Programme (ELDP) recently.
The inauguration was held at the PIM premises, attended by the CEO and Directors of INSEE Cement and PIM, faculty members of PIM and the selected participants of INSEE Academy’s ELDP.
The objective of the ELDP programmeis to transform INSEE Cement’s functional leaders into business leaders.
This meaningful and farsighted objective will be achieved by moving the team of managers from mastery in their own individual functional areas to broader multi-dimensional roles taking them through a structured ‘Certification’ programme.
The 25 participants in the inaugural team of ELDP are currently performing in mid-level managerial roles representing different functions at INSEE Cement. “This is another initiative which confirms the continuous commitment of INSEE Cement in developing our people.
The programme provides an opportunity for the participants not only to apply their learning at work but more importantly, give something back to the workplace, resulting in both individual and organisational growth” said CEO of INSEE Cement, Nandana Ekanayake who was the Chief Guest at the launch.
Prof. Ajantha Dharmasiri, the Director of the Postgraduate Institute of Management (PIM) speaking at the launch said, “We are truly proud and honoured to partner with INSEE Cement in adding value to the progression of their employees.
This programme has been carefully developed to ensure it benefits the participants and motivates them to reach their full potential, undoubtedly inspiring them to become successful leaders in their own spheres.”
The programme has been designed including the effective use of learning diaries, case studies and final project which will go beyond a standard ‘class room’ learning experience.
