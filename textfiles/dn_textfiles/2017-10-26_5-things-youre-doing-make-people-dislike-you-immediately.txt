5 THINGS YOU'RE DOING  THAT MAKE  PEOPLE  DISLIKE YOU IMMEDIATELY

These are the top 5 things you're doing that make people dislike you immediately.
1. Sharing too many photos on social media.
Posting too many photos might alienate people, according to one study that looked at 508 Facebook users. Posting too many family photos may alienate friends and posting too many photos of friends may alienate family. So, keep some photos to yourself.
2. Name-dropping
One study had people name drop tennis pro Roger Federer in emails. The more they stressed their association with Federer, the less liked they were by their colleague. Participants said the emails sounded manipulative.
3. Humblebragging
Most people do this in job interviews, saying things like "I work too hard" or "I care too much". A Harvard study shows that will hurt your odds of getting hired. Instead, state a real weakness that isn't a deal breaker.
4. Hiding your emotions
Researchers showed students two different videos of an actor's face. The actor would either show emotion or remain emotionless, while they watched funny or sad scenes from a movie. Students rated the emotive actor much higher in likeability.
5. Not smiling
A study took 100 students and showed them photos of people posing. Researchers found no matter how the person in the photo posed, people liked them most if they were smiling.
A different study found that smiling made you more memorable, after meeting someone for the first time.
Of course, simply not being a jerk couldn't hurt either!
