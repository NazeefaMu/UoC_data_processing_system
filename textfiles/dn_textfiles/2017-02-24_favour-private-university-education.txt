In favour of private university education

The following are only the best private medical colleges mentioned – there are many more private medical colleges around in the countries mentioned.
Best Private Medical Colleges in five countries bordering Sri Lanka
* Best Private Medical Colleges of Pakistan - 20 in number
* Best Private Medical Colleges in India 2015 - 30 in number
* Best Private Medical Colleges in Nepal - 10 in number
* Best Private Medical Colleges in Bangladesh 48 in number
* Best Private Medical Colleges in Sri Lanka - 0 (Nil)
This gives the picture very clearly.
Sri Lanka is the only country in the entire region without a recognized Private Medical College!
These private medical colleges are catering to a need, earning money – including Foreign Exchange, providing retired doctors with jobs, high salaries and have been enjoying the fruits of their labours. And producing excellent medical graduates. Also saving the country a large sum of money in Government financing these Medical Colleges, which they have been doing in Sri Lanka for the past 70 years.
But Sri Lanka is the only country which has not done this. Why, In 1956 the Sinhala Only Policy was brought in by S W R D Bandaranaike to win the election on the racist card, regardless of the consequences to the people, to education, to administration of government and to the Legal and Medical Profession.
The Bandaranaike Family of course ensured their own three children were educated in three top European universities – Oxford, London and the Sorbonne.
But for the hoi polloi and the riff raff it was Sinhala Only!
Trade union action
Subsequently Governments have not changed this disastrous policy but has continued to use it to gather extra votes at election time to stay in office. They raise this fear among the majority Sinhalese people periodically when they need support for counter-productive legislation, and a lot of other issues.
This has in turn produced a sub-standard education which is widespread in the country and has chased hundreds of thousands of bright students to leave the country for better pastures, never to return.
The vast remainder are mainly dregs of the student levels (Not all of them of course).
Now these GMOA supporters and their cohorts are trying to get the Government to take over the only Private Medical College in the island and convert it into their own messy style of functioning and behaviour patterns and control medical education in the country.
They have even got round the Retired Grama Sevaka (GCE qualified) with no proper understanding of the issues involved to judge this very important issue, threatening trade union action, blackmail, thuggery, cheating and every conceivable method to achieve their aims!
The Sinhala Only policy impoverished the country economically, and in the education fields so badly that there are no signs of recovery ever. The only solution is to have an English only education. China which has a large number of Private Medical Colleges teaches in English-Oxford English is what they opted for. While Sri Lanka which had a high level of Oxford English until 1956, has opted to destroy it. Why this death wish?
Five private medical colleges
The people of this country have been kept in the dark by lying, and by blackmail, threats of Trade Union Action and so forth.
It is about time we bit the bullet and rectified this terrible situation for the students and the country before there will be no country left to govern, and we will be continually living on handouts.
Wake up Sri Lanka and serve justice, fairplay and results in your actions. Otherwise, you and all of us are doomed.
Dr Neville Fernando and his supporters are fighting an uphill battle. Hope they will succeed and that Sri Lanka will have another five private medical colleges shortly. Best of luck to them and to Sri Lanka.
As for the GMOA and their law-breaking followers, they should be taken into custody for action as criminals defying a Supreme Court Decision, and locked up in jail.
The GMOA and their fellow – travellers causing disruption are governed by massive jealousy of the success of the SAITIM programme.
They have to start thinking about the damage they are causing to the country.
