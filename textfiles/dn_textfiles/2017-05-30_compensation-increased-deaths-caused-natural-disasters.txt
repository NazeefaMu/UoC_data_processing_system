Compensation increased for deaths caused by natural disasters

The government has decided to increase the financial compensation for the deaths caused by natural disasters from Rs. 15,000 to Rs. 1 million, Fisheries and Aquatic Resources Development Minister and Mahaweli Development State Minister Mahinda Amaraweera said.
He said Rs. 2,000,000 would be provided to indemnify the damaged houses of the victims.
On a visit to Ranna and Walasmulla to provide relief to the victims of the floods, Amaraweera said the Fisheries and Aquatic Resources Development Ministry had provided 128 boats to the Kalutara District and 100 boasts to the Ratnapura District for the evacuation and disaster mitigation process.
The Minister further said that providing relief for the victims should be given priority over the other matters that concern parliamentarians.
