Schemes underway to battle water scarcity in Anuradhapura North

Three mega water supply schemes are emerging to solve the acute drinking water problem existing in the Anuradhapura North Zone and Thambuttegama area.
The construction of Anuradhapura (North) large scale water supply scheme is in progress, utilising the Mahakanadarawa (33250 a.f) and Wahalkada (43000 a.f) reservoirs as the main water sources, under two phases.
The Japanese international Cooperation Agency (JICA) is offering financial support for the realization of the two components in the Anuradhapura North project.
The construction work of the Mahakanadarawa reservoir-centred phase one programme is already in progress. As an initiative concerning the commencement of phase two of construction work involving Wahalkada, the government recently signed a loan agreement with JICA and no sooner, Cabinet approval was granted to appoint a consultant and award the consultancy contract for detail designing according to the National Water Supply and Drainage Board’s (NWSDB’s) North Central Assistant General Manager S. C. Ratnayake.
