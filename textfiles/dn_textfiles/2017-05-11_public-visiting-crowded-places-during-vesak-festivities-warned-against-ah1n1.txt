Public visiting crowded places during Vesak festivities warned against A(H1N1)

Persons who suffer from even a simple cold should not go out and move in crowded places during the festive season since they may suffer from A(H1N1) and could spread it unknowingly, Health Services Acting Director General Dr. Jayasundara Bandara said.
He was addressing a press conference at the Health Education Bureau in Colombo yesterday.
Bandara said persons with cold should stay away from public places. If they go out, they should cover their face, especially when they sneeze. People should not touch their faces with unwashed hands during and after moving in crowed places.
The public can protect themselves<U+200B> <U+200B>by covering mouth and nose with a handkerchief or a tissue paper when they cough and sneeze. Refraining from touching eyes, nose or mouth, avoiding spitting in public, washing hands regularly with soap and water or cleaning hands with alcohol-based hand rubs, discarding used tissues/handkerchiefs properly and washing used handkerchiefs with a germ killer soap/liquid before re-using will prevent people from contracting the disease, he said.
Influenza A (H1N1) is an ordinary seasonal disease, but elderly people, very young children, pregnant women, post-partum mothers, people who underwent kidney transplant surgeries, people with suppressed immunity and those with chronic diabetes, chronic obstructive airways disease, heart, liver, kidney and metabolic diseases may develop complications if they suffer from A (H1N1), he said.
