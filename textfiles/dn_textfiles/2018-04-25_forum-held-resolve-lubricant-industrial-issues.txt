Forum held to resolve lubricant industrial issues

A special forum was convened by the Public Utility Commission to address the issues faced by the lubricant industry in the country. The forum, ‘Public Consultation on Lubricant Industry’, was held at BMICH yesterday with the participation of over 300 people.
Many speakers spoke about the hardships and the difficulties faced by the industry whereas other environmentalists and officials from quality assessment authorities stressed on the high levels of pollution caused by unethical practices of the lubricant industry.
Although the market is liberalised, an authorization is required to import, export, blend, produce, distribute, supply or sell lubricants in the country.
“The necessity of having an effective and independent mechanism for ensuring product quality, fair prices and protecting the interests of consumers and market players have increased. That’s why the PUSL decided to hold a public consultation on issues related to the issues to advice the government on remedial measures,” PUCSL Director General Damitha Kumarasingha said.
The lubricant market comprises lubricants and greases derived from mineral oil or synthesized from chemical compounds for automotive, industrial and marine applications. The lubricant marketplace is primarily regulated under the Ceylon Petroleum Cooperation Act No 28 of 1961 by the Petroleum Resources Development Ministry.
Sri Lanka boasts 13 market players and 22 authorised lubricant brands. (FJ)
