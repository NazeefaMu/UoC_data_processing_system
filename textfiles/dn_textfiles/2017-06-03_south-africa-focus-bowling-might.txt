South Africa focus on bowling might

Sri Lanka sweat on Mathews fitness:
LONDON, Friday - In a tournament where the batsmen are expected to reign supreme, AB de Villiers has set his side a lofty target for Saturday's ICC Champions Trophy 2017 clash against Sri Lanka: bowl the opposition out. While everyone else is trying to work out how many runs is enough, or even if such a figure really exists in modern-day ODIs, de Villiers believes the best answer is to simply cut an innings off at its knees.
The South African captain's ambitions stem from their recent matches against Sri Lanka - in their last seven encounters, Sri Lanka were bowled out all but once, and on four of those occasions they were dismissed for under 200. Of course, the majority of those games were played in South Africa on pitches that offered something for the bowlers, while the last six ODI innings at The Oval have yielded an average score of 332 for five.
The fact that no total looks particularly safe at the ground leaves teams with a quandary when it comes to selection: do they stack the batting and prepare for a battle of the heavy artillery, or do they prioritise out-and-out bowlers who might take wickets at key times and limit the damage? That question is particularly relevant for South Africa, who have no fewer than five all-rounders and do not have an obvious first-choice XI.
“That is a difficult decision, especially for a game like tomorrow's,” de Villiers said on Friday (June 2). “We know that we have an opportunity and the ability to bowl the Sri Lankan side out. It's a matter of getting that combination right and getting the right players on the park to do so.
“To me it's really important to get your top three to four bowlers in there. Not that the allrounders can't take wickets but I'll probably be leaning towards getting your best bowlers in to make sure we have our best chance to bowl them out and to get 10 wickets in the game.”
That would suggest that Morne Morkel will take his place in the attack along with Kagiso Rabada, Wayne Parnell, Imran Tahir and either Chris Morris, Andile Phehlukwayo or Dwaine Pretorius. As the quickest bowler and most threatening batsman, Morris would appear to be the obvious pick, but then ‘balance’ in South Africa's side is not only cricket-related. They need to average six players of colour with two black Africans in their side, which will always give Phehlukwayo - a fast-emerging all-rounder in his own right - a bit of an edge.
While Morkel was still recovering from injury when Sri Lanka toured earlier this year, the other bowlers all rotated through the series. Every combination proved too much for Sri Lanka, but Upul Tharanga sees reasons why they might be up for the challenge this time around.
“When we lost 5-0 to South Africa, we played on wickets that had grass,” he said. “But in England it's totally different. These wickets are flat. Even during warm-up games we scored 300-plus. We are confident that we can put a decent total on the board.
“They are the number one team, true, but they will be under pressure as well to beat us. We have done really well in ICC events and raised our standards. The other fact that you should not forget is that all our leading players are back in the side. We know what we did wrong in South Africa. It's an opportunity to correct those mistakes.”
RAIN POSTPONES MATHEWS FITNESS
Sri Lanka's balance will depend on Angelo Mathews's fitness. He was scheduled to take a fitness test at the end of training on Friday, but Sri Lanka's session was cut short when the rain swept into The Oval. His participation will now be decided on the morning of the match, and Tharanga confirmed that Mathews will play as a specialist batsman if he is able.
On Thursday, Bangladesh's decision to play an extra batsman at the expense of a specialist bowler hurt them when they were unable to halt a rampant English batting line-up. Like Bangladesh, Sri Lanka will go into this game as underdogs and must find the best balance for the circumstances.
“We will play seven batsman,” said Tharanga. “The wickets are too good and we need four specialist bowlers. Even if Angelo can't bowl, we have other bowlers who can chip in among the batsmen.”
