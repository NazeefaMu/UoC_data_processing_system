High Court Judge expresses displeasure

Colombo High Court Judge A.A.R. Heiyantuduwa yesterday expressed his displeasure regarding an incident where MP Udaya Gammanpila and Sydney Jayasinghe, the two accused in an alleged financial misappropriation case have sent a letter urging appropriate action be taken against two witnesses Janet Shaddick and Lasitha Perera for allegedly criticizing the country’s judicial system at a media briefing.
The High Court Judge advised the defence to refrain from writing letters to the judges in this manner since court cannot hear incidents that are happening outside the courts.
President’s Counsel Shavindra Fernando appearing for the accused, informed Court that his clients have sent a letter urging Chief Justice to take appropriate action against two witnesses for bringing the Sri Lankan justice system and the legal system to contempt. A copy of the concerned letter had been sent to the Colombo High Court as well.
Meanwhile, Deputy Solicitor General Dileepa Peiris appearing for the Attorney General questioned as to how the accused in a case directly writes to the judge. "If the said witnesses had expressed their views at a press conference regarding the case, equally the second accused Udaya Gammanpila had also made several statements regarding the case. The letter sent to the Judge had been signed by two accused. Their intention were to prejudice your honor’s mind".
Janet Shadick the wife Australian businessman Brian Shaddick had told in a press briefing held on May 26 that defence counsel were in an attempt to delay the conclusion of the case by obtaining further dates for cross-examination of witnesses.
During the press briefing, the two witnesses said that they were treated as criminals during the proceedings. Addressing the press briefing, Ms. Shadick said Sri Lankans should be ashamed of their legal system and it would be impossible to get justice for ordinary Sri Lankans. She further advised Sri Lankans not to litigate politicians or wealthy people because they would never win.
