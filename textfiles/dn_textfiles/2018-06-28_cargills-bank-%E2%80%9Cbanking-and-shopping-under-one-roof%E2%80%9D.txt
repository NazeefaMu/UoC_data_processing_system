Q. How does Cargills Bank Mobile App supports the “Cargills Cash” initiative?
A.Cargills Cash Mobile App has a separate function to carry out this transaction and works through one time password (OTP) authorization. This mechanism safe guards the customer from emerging cyber security threats plus creates more attraction as we are using a smart phone. The interface is very simple and easy for use.
Q. How does Cargills Cash make life convenient to a regular shopper?
A. Now with “Cargills Cash” you can Deposit and Withdraw Cash, send money to any mobile and could pay the grocery bill by directly debiting the account. The transaction update is real time hence all payments are immediately credited. The service is further expanded to merchant payments where a customer can simply pay their travel ticket, or real estate advertisement or e-commerce goods’ payments through Cargills Food City. The bank has currently partnered with Ikman.lk, Kapura.lk, Mydeal.lk, Allianz Insurance, Findmyfare.com and Sri Lankan Air lines etc. All these would make life easy for a customer as they could do their banking and payments while they shop on a weekend.
Q. What are the future plans for “Cargills Cash”?
A. We have already developed the USSD method to make transactions possible through even basic analogue mobile phones. Further QR Code acceptance will be introduced to the service creating a slip-less environment. In future, customers could simply walk-in to any Cargills Food City and hold their mobile to the QR reader to directly proceed with the transactions without filling a single slip.
