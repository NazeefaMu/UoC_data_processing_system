Govt. committed to safeguarding farmers: President

The farmers are the real owners of the land and the government takes the responsibility of safeguarding that ownership, said President Maithripala Sirisena.
The President made these observations distributing the title deeds to residents of the Moneragala district under the Derana Abiseka Programme organised by the Uva Provincial Council, at Wellawaya on Monday.
The President said these farmers didn’t possess any legal documents to the lands that they cultivated and developed so far. “The farmers shed tears for not having rain and sometimes they are unable to sell their agricultural produce for a fair price. They also lack the ability to purchase fertilizer and pesticides. They face many difficulties engaging in their agricultural activities," he said.
He said, the government is ready face these challengers provide relief to the farmers as agriculture leads the country to prosperity. As a solution to the water scarcity in the Moneragala district the government commenced the construction of the Kumbukkan Oya Water Project last month, the President said.
He said 25 percent of the people in Moneragala are affected by poverty and 16 percent suffer from malnutrition. Therefore, the government will take all measures to address these issues by uplifting the standard of health facilities.
“2017 is dedicated to poverty alleviation and the government is ready to launch various projects in this regard,” he said.
The President said in 2016 and 2017 severe drought was experienced in Anuradapura, Polonnaruwa, Moneragala and the North West. Consequently the farmers couldn’t achieve their agricultural goals. But, we are lucky to experience rain now as a blessing to the county, he noted.
"Some power hungry elements were happy when we experienced the drought but with the prevailing rain their hopes were shattered as the government launched people focused projects during drought,” he said.
The President said some independent media channels criticize the government, but the government is very stable. The President also emphasized the necessity to upgrade the facilities of the Wellawaya hospital. He made these observations after opening the new building of the hospital. The President distributed title deeds to farmers of Wellawaya, Moneragala and Madulla Divisional Secretariat areas.
