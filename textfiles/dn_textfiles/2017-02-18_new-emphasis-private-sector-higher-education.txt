New emphasis on private sector in Higher Education

Moving away from other issues grabbing political attention in recent weeks, the South Asian Institute of Technology and Medicine – SAITM – continued to grab the headlines this week, showing importance of the private sector’s role in the wider field of education, and the possibility of the SAITM issue bringing about new understanding on both private and public education.
University students and teachers, and Government Medical Officers, maintained their opposition to SAITM, and the decision of the Court of Appeal on the provisional registration of SAITM students by the Sri Lanka Medical Council (SLMC) became a new focus of debate. Despite the Minister of Higher Education calling on the SLMC to implement the Appeal Court Order without delay, there are signs that the SAITM issue could be moving towards a reasonable solution. President Sirisena’s statement that he would not allow any unfair action on any students with regard to this issue, was a welcome healing balm, which has helped take the issue towards resolution by negotiation.
The Ministry of Higher Education’s call on SAITM to suspend admission for six months while a periodic review of its medical programme is conducted, coming after a meeting with the Deans of eight Medical Faculties in the country, is seen as an approach that could bring about better understanding on an issue that is politically heated.
Of much significance are the suggestions by these Deans of Medical Faculties – of the Colombo, Ragama, Karapitiya, Rajarata, Batticaloa, Peradeniya, Jaffna and Sri Jayawardenepura universities – that go beyond the immediate SAITM issue, and cover the wider standards of medical institutions in the country. Of much importance is their pointing out that the SLMC must remain the authorized institution that decides on the standards of medical doctors, and that its independence should be safeguarded. They also noted the necessity for Parliament to legalize the minimum standards for training in medical colleges in the island, and in this context saw it imperative for the Health Minister to present to Parliament the related standards recommended by the SLMC.
The wider issue
The SAITM issue in its current dispute has brought forward the wider issue of the role of the private sector in higher education, especially medical education, as well as the role of Private-Public Partnership in such education. It calls on those who plan the progress of education to consider the actual needs of the people, in an area of service where Sri Lanka had held a leading position in South Asia and beyond too for many decades, but where we are rapidly losing that status. It is the view of many academics, who have seen the steady decline in the standards of our universities, that the current situation raises questions about the university entrance system, the District Quotas, and importantly, the opportunities available to those who are not able to enter the state universities.
In the context of the new trends on handling the SAITM issue, the government will have to pay attention to how it will have a control of the anti-SAITM campaigning of the GMOA, the Inter University Students Federation (IUSF) and the Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP). This will not be easy in the context of their commitments against SAITM, and is not helped by the continuing attacks on state universities by SAITM teachers, as well as, the harsh allegations being made by leading members of SAITM against the SLMC. The Ministries of Higher Education and Health will be required to take special initiatives to bring about a proper negotiated solution on the SAITM and private higher education issues through a better understanding of these matters by the public.
The necessity for this is highlighted by the news of the Minister of Higher Education Kiriella presenting a Cabinet Paper for the establishing of a foreign university in the Kalutara District. What is said to be US $ 75 million investment, this is expected to be built on 100 acres of land, and will be a non-state degree awarding institution, as a branch of India’s Manipal University. This is certainly an indication of a new area of private investment in the country, and will lay emphasis on the necessity for the SAITM issue to be resolved with the least delay, and the best understanding among all parties.
The MR twist
The politics of SAITM has given an ignominious and disgraceful twist to the politics of Mahinda Rajapaksa, in what seems to be a desperate hunt for popularity. In his recent statement outside the Colombo Chief Magistrate’s Court, MR, who had come to that court where his brother Gotabhaya was summoned for the Avant Garde Armoury Case, said his government had given approval for the functioning of SAITM based on ‘certain conditions’.
There is no record of any such conditions being imposed by the Rajapaksa Regime. Instead, there is every sign of outright support for SAITM, with several scholarships for SAITM students named after him, and the approvals of the various examinations at SAITM in those years, by the University Grants Commission, when it had little signs of being an independent body. There is also the record of how MR’s son, Namal Rajapaksa, was received with such grandeur at SAITM, by both staff and students, when he came there for what was supposed to be an observation visit.
Mahinda Rajapaksa is today the subject of many cartoons in newspapers that even support his policies on other issues, over this complete twist on the SAITM issue. There are also many editorial comments, even from media outlets that support MR and the Joint Opposition on other issues, on his wholly unexpected change of ’policy’, with a clear search for popularity at any cost.
PM scores Down Under
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe did make an important and historic visit to Australia this week, in an outing that sought to widen and strengthen Sri Lanka’s current efforts to be an economic and financial hub in the Indian Ocean. A strong policy initiative of the PM, this seeks to strengthen bi-lateral, economic, political and social ties with countries of the Indian Ocean region, and Australia certainly has an important role in this.
The historical significance of this visit is that it is the first visit by a Sri Lankan Prime Minister to Australia since the visit there by Sir John Kotelawala in 1954. The two countries have maintained good relations, with much of this to do with Cricket. But PM Wickremesinghe’s current visit did make a difference with the assurances from Aussie Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull that his country will assist the new economic reconstruction programme launched by Sri Lanka. This is of much significance for this country as it seeks to bring new investment and mark a rise in its importance from its strategic location in the Indian Ocean.
Prime Minster Turnbull was strong in his praise for Sri Lanka for the constant support extended to Australia to combat human smuggling and illegal immigration. There was attention drawn towards improving and widening regional trade and investment opportunities in keeping with the declaration of the Commonwealth, when it met in Sri Lanka.
Both parties agreed that current bilateral cooperation in the Education and Security sectors should be widened, with special attention to the sphere of maritime security, which is of much significance to Sri Lanka. The discussion between the two Prime Ministers and their delegations paid much attention to improving investment opportunities in Sri Lanka’s agricultural sector, the mining, energy and technology sectors, which are of much importance to the country in its strategies for progress.
Prime Minister Wickremesinghe also made an important statement that asylum seekers from Sri Lanka now held in special centres in the Pacific Islands are free to return to Sri Lanka. “They are welcome to return to Sri Lanka and we won’t prosecute them…Come Back”, was his message. This was especially significant for the asylum seekers, some of whom may be hoping to get refugee status in the USA, under an agreement between President Barack Obama and the Australian Government, which related to 1,250 refugees.
It is important to recall that President Donald Trump has described this agreement as ‘a very bad deal’, and even complained that Australia was trying to send “the next Boston bomber” to the US. There is no indication whether Sri Lankan refugees will find favour for admission to the US. But they now have the assurance given by Prime Minister Wickremesinghe that they are free to return to Sri Lanka, with no threat of prosecution.
This is certainly a major move by the Prime Minister in the context of Sri Lanka’s policy of reconciliation and peace building. It is a highlight of the Mr. Wickremesinghe’s visit to Australia, which stands out as one of the most impactful visits abroad by a Prime Minister and key government representative from Sri Lanka in recent years.
