TRUMP's NEW WORLD ORDER

 
The first US policy on immigration in 1948 welcoming persons fleeing persecution saw 205,000 refugees which increased to 415,000 in two years and by 1952 rules for Asian immigrants were relaxed. President Truman whose veto was overridden by a vote of 278 to 113 in the house and 57 to 26 in the senate, quoting from his veto message said: “we do not need to be protected against immigrants. On the contrary we want to stretch a helping hand to succour those who are brave enough to escape from barbarism. In no other realms of our national life are we so hampered and stultified by the dead hand of the past as we are in the field of immigration.” 
Donald Trump's choice preferences of precautionary measures in national interest are spot on. That indeed may not go down well with the world at large and could be argued at length. As a pragmatist and realist he has to churn the wheels of government in a way that he thinks is going to be effective and beneficial for him and in doing it his way has flashed a welcome smiley on all anti-Muslim elements. Netanyahu and Putin are important side kicks for Trump if he is to paralyze the ISIS. His success story, if ever, only time will tell. Unlike under former American leadership, he sees the importance of teaming up with Russia towards such goal attainment. This he has done quite successfully. But whether it will hold in the international sphere needs to be watched as the days unfold against the backdrop of a surge in criticism progressively mounting.
Retrospective analysis of US immigration laws from 1885 -1990 all of which had a distinct rationale basis were far different from emotion based, Trump favoured policies. Governments of those times not only acted on US needs in immigration policies but also unfailingly took serious note of the humanitarian aspect as well - a distant wail from today's ethnocentric leanings.

Immigration act
Certainly, the Trump endeavour is not the maiden American attempt to lid immigrants. The 1924 immigration act even debarred entry of Asians. Way back, the 1917 immigration act confronted international distaste and invited the utter disgust and consternation of President Woodrow Wilson who vetoed it only to be met with a congressional overruling. He saw it as soiling American values much looked up to by the world. According to him, not only did the act efface the high ideals which America stood for, it also prevented many good people from entering American society. In vetoing the act Wilson said,
“It will all but close entirely the gates of asylum which have always been open to those who could find nowhere else the right of opportunity of constitutional agitation for what they conceived to be the natural, inalienable right of man. This right of political asylum has brought to the country many a man of noble character and elevated purpose who was marked as an outlaw in his own less fortunate land and who has become an ornament to our citizenship and public mind.”
UK/US trade deal
But Woodrow Wilson and Donald Trump are two different personalities. One sees the nobility of character and elevated purpose in an asylum seeker that will contribute to American societal fertility while the other views them as a formidable threat. One possesses the vibrant armour of intellectual depth while the other skims the surface for want of emotional brilliance. Trump has dedicated his life to amassing American Petro dollars while Woodrow has what money cannot buy drawing out his most positive potential in the realms of intellectual grandeur. Even in appearance they are poles apart. Woodrow the elegant of the two while Trump has missed out on the elevated plane. House of Commons speaker John Bercow in a moment of brilliance punched Trump straight in the face when he said,” addressing the House of Commons is not an automatic right. It has got to be earned. As far as this place is concerned, I feel very strongly that our opposition to racism and sexism and our support for equality before the law and an independent judiciary are hugely important considerations in the House of Commons.”
However Prime Minister Theresa May's plans are afoot to green light Trump’s state visit to realize a UK/US trade deal. Perhaps the British style of a ‘ kick and kiss ‘ for Trump - though only the French are renowned for diplomacy the world over. Perhaps closer geographical proximity between the two countries does not rule out the possibility of French influence and inspiration over Britain.
Towing Woodrow Wilson's line of thought, the American Judiciary somersaulted on the executive's orders of dispatching immigrants. It no doubt deserved a standing ovation proving that country's judiciary be a great celebration to America's democratic values. The US Federal Court has even upheld the suspension. Writing off Muslim immigrants, building walls and what else is to come off Trump's Pandora's Box one has to wait and see - certainly not a good sign of enlightened and elegant governance.
But that such governance as is Trump’s cannot have its way and say is well proven in the American theory of checks and balances where the three governing arms namely the executive, judiciary and legislative act independently of one another without any external influence. Politicization in the American system has no chance and where such governance exists emotional government over what is rational becomes operational. In this volatile state of politicization of administration, the chances of national progress are undermined.
Viewing humanity in a much broader concept is where justice prevails and has very much to do with Christian ideals which invariably and unfailingly strike commonality with other religions as well. Those eminent men that comprised the American bar that dispensed justice for sure are all practicing Christians and they rose to stature proving themselves to be worthy of Christ's followers. If the Mexican wall and Muslim ethnicity are going to be Trump's bugbear, he certainly invites sympathy for his limited understanding of the higher purpose of life - a key attribute a charismatic leader ought to posses. A wrenched, stunted outlook will not carry the American President any where. Already, he has failed to impress the world at large except invite global distaste in the kind of warped mentality he displays. In his relentless struggle of pecuniary fortification he has missed out on seeing all else beyond the glistening dollar not to forget his outstanding record of pecuniary aggrandizement.
Donald Trump and Mahinda Rajapaksa
Power in the hands of such personalities carries the risk of furthering instability in an already unstable world. Contrastingly Canada, UK and Germany all of whom have welcomed the Muslim refugees in a grand show of magnanimity have expressed unwillingness to be accommodative of the ‘trump card’ - surely symbolic of character and depth of those state heads.
It is well known that high degree centralization and polarization are twin brothers. Both breed and expand national and global chaos. Mitigating the presence of both will enable the chances of reconciliation and peace. Such administrative prowess hallmarks the entry of a statesman while fostering both is to the advantage of a petty politician for as the oft’ quoted saying goes, the former is conscious of the next elections while the latter, the next generation. Trump has already unfolded his incapacity to show up in the realms of statesmanship.
The world is in the direction of narrowed vision, most intolerant of flamboyancy so easily taken to by youth of a recent generation. However, to capture political power, playing up to ethno/ religious identity is compulsory which was the sole preserve of both Donald Trump and Mahinda Rajapaksa. They may even perhaps take cue from other world leaders and poets who have embellished world history by a portrayal of dignity, effulgence and a collaborative endeavour with what they saw as the best.
For instance, when Nehru wanted the winds of change to blow across India from the four corners of the world, he was not into rigid insistence of India's cultural purity nor did he fear cultural pollution. Tagore, echoing similar sentiments prayed to realize a ‘world not broken up into fragments by narrow domestic walls’ such as ethno / religious/ caste, national and other social constructs of boundaries. If Nelson Mandela was to avenge the South African whites’ misdeeds against the blacks, deportation of that community would have been his preferred option. Yet, as is characteristic of Mandela's liberality, he insisted on a black populace assurance that he would not leave jail until and unless every white man was safe.
Obviously Trump's concave lenses denied him similar broader vision reflective only of a magnanimous statesman. Arguable indeed is that nit picking is his lot overlooking the blessed sight of the larger picture.
