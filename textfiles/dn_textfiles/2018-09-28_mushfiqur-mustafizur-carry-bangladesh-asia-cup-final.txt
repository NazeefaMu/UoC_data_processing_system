Mushfiqur, Mustafizur carry Bangladesh into Asia Cup final

ABU DHABI, Wednesday: Bangladesh cashed in on Pakistan’s frailties in their batting to pull off a 37-run win in the final Super Four match of the Asia Cup played at the Sheikh Zayed Stadium here on Wednesday and book a berth in Friday’s final with India.
Bangladesh’s victory was set up by former captain Mushfiqur Rahim who rescued his team from a bad start at 12 for 3 to a respectable score of 239 with a fighting knock of 99 and left-arm fast bowler Mustafizur Rahman who outshone his Pakistani rival Junaid Khan by capturing four wickets for 43 runs as Pakistan replied with only 202-9.
Junaid returning to the Pakistan team for his first game replacing the out of form Mohammad Asif took 4 for 19 to bowl Bangladesh out inside 50 overs after they won the toss and decided to bat first.
Pakistan were also pushed onto the backfoot by the early loss of three wickets for 18 runs, but unlike Bangladesh they failed to stitch together any big partnership – highest being 71 for the sixth wicket between Imam ul Haq who top scored for them with 83 off 105 balls and Asif Ali (31) and eventually fell short of a total which they could have easily overhauled on another day.
Bangladesh recovered from their early loss largely through a fighting fourth wicket partnership between Mushfiqur and Mohammed Mithun who blunted the Pakistani bowling which had their tails up after the early successes to put on 144 runs.
Mushfiqur once again showed what a big game player he was batting according to the situation to rescue his team. He battled through cramps on his right leg to score a brilliant 99 off 116 balls with nine fours before edging a catch behind the wicket to Sarfraz off Shaheen Afridi one short of a deserving hundred.
Later Mushfiqur who took the Man of the Match award rated the innings in his top five.
“This [innings] is definitely top five. We needed one partnership badly at that time. The unavailability of Shakib and Tamim, the fact that we were three down early, it certainly makes it special. Also, Pakistan’s attack, their understanding of these conditions, those factors contribute to make it an important win,” Mushfiqur said.
Mithun who proved an ideal foil to Mushfiqur made 60 out of 84 balls (6 fours) before Hasan Ali provided the breakthrough for Pakistan by having him hit back a tame return catch.
Bangladesh’s innings went into decline once the stand was broken and they lost their last seven wickets for 83 runs as Junaid and Ali produced some excellent death bowling.
Bangladesh went into this crucial match without their most experienced allrounder Shakib Al Hasan who was ruled out with a fractured finger.
