South Africa finish fifth in ICC U19 Cricket World Cup

Fast bowlers Fraser Jones and Akhonya Mnyaka ripped through Bangladesh’s batting line-up as South Africa scored a comfortable eight-wicket victory at the John Davies Oval in Queensland to finish fifth at the ICC U19 Cricket World Cup on Wednesday.
Jones, playing only his second match of the tournament, grabbed five for 33 and left-arm bowler Mnyaka took three for 27 as Bangladesh were bowled out for 178 in 41.4 overs after deciding to bat in the fifth-sixth position play-off match.
The 2014 champions did not face any problems and reached 180 for two in 38.3 overs as captain Raynard van Tonder played a fluent knock of 82 (99b, 7x4, 2x6) to tally his total runs to 384 in the tournament , joining former captain Graeme Smith as the joint-third highest aggregate of runs for a South Africa batsman in an ICC U19 Cricket World Cup. Dominik Hendricks (391 runs in 2010) and Aiden Markram (370 in 2014) are the individuals with more runs in a single edition from the country.
