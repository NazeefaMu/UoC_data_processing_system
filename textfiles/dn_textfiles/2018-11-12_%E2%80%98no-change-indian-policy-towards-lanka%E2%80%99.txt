‘No change in Indian policy towards Lanka’

India is prepared to work in close co-operation with Sri Lanka irrespective of whichever Government is in power, the Indian Central Government has emphasised.
A senior spokesman for the Indian Central Government had said India’s foreign policy remained unchanged even if there is a change of government in any country.
He made this point clear at a discussion held with a visiting group of Sri Lankan Journalists in New Delhi recently.
India which had great faith in democracy existing in Sri Lanka believed that it was the duty and responsibility of Sri Lankan people to resolve their country’s problems themselves by honouring the Constitution. Friendship and relations between Sri Lanka and India had existed for centuries and the Central government hoped to continue them without any interruption he said adding that Mattala Airport project was a joint venture between the two continues with purely commercial motives.
He had said that bilateral negotiations on ETCA were in final stages and its progress would depend on the enthusiasm shown by Sri Lanka.
