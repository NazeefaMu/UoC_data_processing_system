Keith Noyahr abduction case:
CID to record statement at MR’s home

The Criminal Investigation Department (CID) will record a statement from former President Mahinda Rajapaksa tomorrow in connection with the abduction and torture of journalist Keith Noyahr, the Department said.
The notice regarding the statement was handed over to Rajapaksa on August 13.
According to the CID, the statement from the former President would be recorded tomorrow morning at his official residence in Wijerama Mawatha, Colombo 7.
The CID intends to record a statement from Rajapaksa with regard to Keith Noyahr’s abduction due to information revealed by Speaker Karu Jayasuriya in the statement he made in connection with the Noyahr case. The CID had earlier made several requests from the former President to give a statement, but Rajapaksa had not responded.
Previously, the CID recorded a statement from Speaker Karu Jayasuriya for almost five hours.
Based on the information gathered from the Speaker’s statement, the CID had notified former President Rajapaksa in writing, to grant the CID a date to obtain a statement from him.
In his statement, the Speaker had noted that he had received the initial information regarding Keith Noyahr’s abduction and had taken measures to notify then President Mahinda Rajapaksa immediately and measures were taken to save Noyahr’s life.
