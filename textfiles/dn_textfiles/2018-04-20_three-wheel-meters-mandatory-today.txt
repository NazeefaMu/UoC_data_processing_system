Three-wheel meters mandatory from today

 
Meters for three-wheelers will be mandatory from today.
The legal requirement is implemented under the direction of Transport and Civil Aviation Minister Nimal Siripala de Silva to ensure a quality transport service to the public.
He said that under this measure three-wheeler drivers are required to issue a receipt to their customers for the fee charged for each trip.
National Council for Road Safety Dr. Sisira Kodagoda said that the Police are vested with powers to arrest any individual who fails to comply with this new implementation.
The law was to be implemented from April 1. It was postponed by a few weeks on requests made by taxi driver associations.
