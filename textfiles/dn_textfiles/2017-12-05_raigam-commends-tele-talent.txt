Raigam commends tele talent

The 14th edition of Raigam Tele’es, a tele-awards ceremony, is set to be held at the Nelum Pokuna Mahinda Rajapaksa Theatre on March 24, 2018. As the only tele/film award ceremony in the region held within the first quarter of the year, the organisers will face numerous challenges with only a few months to finalise everything.
According to Raigam Chairman, Dr Ravi Liyanage, no other international festival – Oscar and Grammy included – has achieved this target. That said, the festival reaches closer to international standards with a new move.
“Continuation of an award ceremony at the highest level for 14 consecutive years, overcoming many challenges is a special victory for us. We are pleased to see that today the Raigam Tele’es has become a special event of all stakeholders of the industry. We share that happiness and the strength we have thus gained with the media and the general public,” Raigam Kingdom Managing Director Ganaka Amarasinghe said.
An occasion can retain its value and currency only if it evolves with the passage of time while maintaining its core values. If, in an award ceremony, award winners are queued up and given awards just for the sake of holding an award ceremony. That event will not generate any interest. At least not for very long. With the Raigam ceremony, however, the organisers are always committed to provide a new experience to the audience while maintaining the values of the event. Raigam has established that set of norms strictly adhered to in all aspects of the event.
The 14th encounter of the festival has seen a slight change in the panel of judges. Professor Patrick Ratnayake, who had been the panel chairman, has been replaced by Jayasumana Dissanayake. The panel comprises Professor Ariyaratne Kaluarachchi, Professor Ajantha Hapuarachchi, Gunasiri Silva, Hansamala Ritigahapola, Ranga Dasanayake, Dhanushka Gunathilaka, Aruna Gunaratne and Dr Arundathi Sriranganathan. Although Raigam initiated the festival to recognise the talents of the tele-drama industry, later on the horizons were expanded into other television programmes such as sports, children’s, political, news, documentary, reality and so on.
The SMS voting will be open from February 23 to March 23, 2018. About 25 participants from the SMS voting will be selected to receive two invitations each to witness the Raigam Tele’es 2017. The winners who will receive a message from the Raigam Tele’es Secretariat through the elephone number used to send the SMS will be entitled to receive printed invitations by forwarding the message at the gate. The telephone numbers for SMS are 0772 522522 and 0702722722.
The entries for Raigam Tele’es 2017 are now accepted by the Raigam Tele’es Secretariat and will be closed on January 15, 2018.
