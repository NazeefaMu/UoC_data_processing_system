Councillors condemn Vijayakala’s alleged statement

A group of Southern Provincial (SP) councillors staged a demonstration to denounce a statement allegedly made by Child Affairs State Minister Vijayakala Maheshwaran at a state function held in Jaffna, on Monday.
The councillors launched the protest opposite the Southern Provincial Secretariat at Kalegana, Galle, yesterday, following the conclusion of the inauguration of the fifth session of the seventh Southern Provincial council by Southern Province Governor Marshal Perera.
The objecting councillors carried placards, while denouncing the state minister’s alleged aspiration for the re-emergence of the LTTE.
Southern Provincial Council Opposition Leader Tennakoon Nilame also participated in the protest.
