Minister Dr. Senaratne had stated that the tax on tobacco had been increased up to 90 percent and plain packaging will be introduced for cigarette packets. The pictorial warning has already been introduced . He expressed these views after opening a health camp at Bulathsinghala Retiyala school. Minister Dr. Senaratne said that aid will be provided for tobacco farmers who lose their job. The World Bank and the World Health Organisation will assist them to commence alternative employment projects.The price of a cancer drug had been brought down to Rs.144,000 from Rs.285,000.
"Some MPs come to Parliament like empty coconuts flowing down the river. When they get some money from a drug company they think that they have gone to heaven. One MP ,who was once digging mines and cannot read three letters printed on a drug, is trying to teach me about health," the Minister added.
