Anura Kumara complains of Police double standards

 Chief Opposition Whip and JVP Leader Anura Kumara Dissanayake yesterday in Parliament, drew a comparison as to how differently the MPs and students protesting on streets are treated by the Police.
“The belts, medals and badges of Parliament Police personnel were removed before they were allowed into the Chamber on Wednesday being extra cautious of the MPs’ security. On the contrary,the Police are permitted to use tear gas, water cannon and batons on students protesting on the streets. How do you justify this difference?” he questioned. The MP was moving an Adjournment Motion in Parliament yesterday.
He also said even though Law and Order Minister Sagala Ratnayaka told Parliament that the Government was looking for two suspects in connection with the shooting incident of SAITM CEO Dr Sameera Senaratne, the two suspects had not been arrested when they surrendered to court.
Meanwhile, MP Vasudeva Nanayakkara rising to a Point of Order questioned how Parliament Police were allowed into the main Chamber on Wednesday through the lobby of Opposition side, adding that it was a breach of Parliamentary privileges.
