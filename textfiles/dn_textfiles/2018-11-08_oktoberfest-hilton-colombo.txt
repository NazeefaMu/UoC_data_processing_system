OKTOBERFEST at Hilton Colombo

`Oktoberfest’, the Biggest Bavarian German Food and Beer Festival in town, was held at Hilton Colombo recently. German born Executive Chef Robert Mujagic prepared the banquet at this year’s event popularly known to be the “Original” Oktoberfest. Inside the large marquee, visitors were able to enjoy traditional Bavarian food and brew, served by staff wearing ‘lederhosen’, and accompanied by music played by a live band from Germany.
