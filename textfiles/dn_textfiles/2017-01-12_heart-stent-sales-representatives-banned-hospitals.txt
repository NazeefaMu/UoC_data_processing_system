Heart stent sales representatives banned from hospitals

 
Health Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne had instructed Colombo National Hospital Director General Dr. Anil Jasinghe to ban heart stent sales representative from entering into the hospital premises, Media Secretary to the Health Minister Nipun Ekanayake said.
Ekanayake said the order had come after the Health Ministry received information that heart stent sales representatives were trying to sell heart stents, which are given free, to possible customers.
The Health Ministry has also received many complaints from patients and from their guardians that they were being charged by doctors for heart stents and lenses, he added.
Minister Dr. Senaratne had ordered an immediate investigation into the issue.
Charging money for eye lenses and heart stents is now prohibited at all state hospitals, Ekanayake said. He said Medical Supplies Division Director Dr. Lal Panapitiya would issue the relevant circular shortly, under the direction of Minister Dr. Senaratne.
