Point of View
Equity markets rebounded to a net positive position after a week’s hiatus, gaining 40 index points W-o-W cf. last week’s decline of 60 points. The ASPI consequently pushed past the 6600-level, to touch a one-week high of 6633 points as retailers who have been largely on the sidelines over the past few weeks re-entered markets on expectations that the prevailing low interest rate environment would continue for longer.
Equity markets over the month of October rose 2.7%, helping wipe off some of the losses recorded at the start of Q3 2017 (-5.5%) in the run up to Parliamentary approval of the new IRD bill.
The ASPI lost 4.6% over Q3 2017 as tax concerns dominated markets, but the greater certainty post-approval of the tax reforms have led to markets rebounding strongly to gain approximately 250 points in the weeks following approval of the Act. Although lower than that of last week, institutional and HNI activity also remained relatively strong, with crossings for the week accounting to 42% of total market turnover (cf. 55% last week) amid heavy activity in Sampath Bank, CCS and JKH which cumulatively accounted for approximately 25% of total market turnover for the week. Interest in Dialog and a strategic transaction in Ascot also helped propel turnover levels, with crossings in Dialog accounting for 10% of total crossings and Ascot accounting for 11% of the week’s total crossings.
Despite this activity though, average daily turnover levels (Rs 0.83 Bn) fell 15% over the week to close 11% lower than the YTD average of Rs 0.94 Bn. Net foreign flows to the Bourse however, rebounded to a positive position this week, totaling Rs 535 Mn cf. last week’s outflows of Rs 1.1 Bn.
Markets in the week ahead are likely to look for cues from Sept Quarter corporate earnings which have begun trickling in.
Sri Lanka’s higher fuel import bill in Jan-Aug 2017 is in line with Acuity’s predictions earlier this year that the country’s fuel import bill will increase amid higher global oil prices and higher volumes due to drought-induced thermal-based power-generation. The Fuel import bill in Jan-Aug 2017 rose 54% Y-o-Y to $2,153 Mn (cf. $1,401 Mn in Jan-Aug 2016) as oil prices have risen 26% and import volumes have increased 22% relative to the comparable period last year.
It is expected that the year-end fuel import bill to be $3.3 Bn (in line with our earlier estimate of $3.1 Bn) as Brent crude oil prices are expected to close the year at $ 54/bbl amid tightening supply and stronger demand fundamentals.
Although this increase is expected to widen the trade deficit, the consistent capital inflows and an improved reserve position seen throughout 2017 will continue to support the year-end LKR value.
Some movement is likely due to seasonal importer dollar demand, but overall, the year-end LKR value is expected to be broadly stable. Nevertheless, external risks beyond 2017 have heightened amid increasing indications that Developed Market Central Banks (Fed, ECB, BoJ, BoE) are beginning to end an era of exceptional quantitative easing.
The synchronized monetary policy normalization (ie, end of QE programs) by the these Central Banks could increase Sri Lanka’s external financing risks (external debt repayments due between 2019 and 2022 are expected to average $3.6 Bn p.a) as higher global rates could result in lower risk appetite for Sri Lanka’s planned ISB issues in 2018/19 while simultaneously lowering foreign inflows to bonds and T-bills and pressurizing the LKR.
