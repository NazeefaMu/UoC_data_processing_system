IUSF Convenor Lahiru Weerasekara remanded until July 5

 
Inter University Students’ Federation (IUSF) Convenor Lahiru Weerasekara was remanded until July 5 by the Maligakanda Magistrate today.
Lahiru Weerasekara and five others were arrested by Police after a press conference in Maradana, earlier today.
The IUSF created a tense situation at the Health Ministry on Wednesday by storming the ministry premises, removing name boards and burning them during the protest against legalising the South Asian Institute of Technology and Medicine (SAITM).
On June 21, the Colombo Fort Magistrate Court issued an order to the IUSF to refrain from obstructing the public while protesting.
