Construction work on the first phase of the proposed Matara-Kataragama Railway development project from Matara to Beliatte is almost nearing completion.
According to project officials, it is expected to be vested in public ownership very soon. The total length of the Matara–Beliatta extension of the proposed Matara-Kataragama project is 26.75 kilo meters. Main railway stations have already been erected in Kekanadura, Babarenda, Weurukannala and Beliatta, as have substations in Piladuwa and Weherahena. In addition 12 main bridges, there have been 10 small bridges, two 1.5 kilometer-long bridges with sluices, 49 concrete bridges, two tunnels, 16 subways, and eight railway crossings constructed on this new railway line. The longest railway tunnel in Sri Lanka, at a length of 616 meters, has also been built up at Nakuttiya on this rail road.
The total expenditure for the project is USD $278.2 million. Necessary funds are being provided by a Chinese company project, officials said.
