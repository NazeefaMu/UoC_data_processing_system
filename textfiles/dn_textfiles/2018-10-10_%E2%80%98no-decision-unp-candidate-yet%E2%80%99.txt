‘No decision on UNP candidate yet’

The UNP has not decided or come to a conclusion over its Presidential candidate for the 2020 Presidential Election.
It will be decided by the UNP’s Central Working Committee, Law and Order and Public Administration and Management Deputy Minister Nalin Bandara said. “I reject media reports which spread false stories about this. The UNP unanimously hopes to field a candidate of our own.
“There are one and half years for the election and hence, we have enough time to take the right decision,” he told the media in Kurunegala yesterday.
