Masters of magic

One of the biggest mysteries in life is how they create these illusions? How do they do it? How do they do the incredible things they do? Do they manipulate our minds? Does magic run in their blood like Harry Potter? How different are they from you and I? How have they mastered the art of illusion? They do amazing stuff and no one has any idea as to how they do it?
Knight of Illusions, a professional magic show was held last Saturday at the Bishop’s College Auditorium. The show featured award winning magicians such as Xavier Mortimer, Michael Finney, the duo Neill Croswell and Ashley Da Silva and Hannibal the ‘magic warrior’.
These are some of the greatest magicians in the business and their magic repertoire is absolutely amazing. Ayati Trust is building the National Center for kids with disability and this show will raise awareness for the charity and would aim at donating its profits towards the project.
Magic has always appealed to the minds of human beings unless you are a person who is of the cynical or skeptical nature. J.K. Rowling’s Harry Potter has taken the world by storm. The books and the films are highly popular. Adults like children wish they could go to Hogwarts and learn magic! But is magic real?
Well transfiguration may not be possible like the way Professor McGonagall changed a wine glass into a rat! But magic is quite real. How else could doves and rabbits suddenly appear from nowhere? Magic is a business and maybe one day we could have a magic academy in Sri Lanka? Just like Hogwarts! How exciting would that be!
Knight of Illusions was a brand created way back in 2001 to promote Magic and Illusions in Sri Lanka. This time magic was taken to a different and more exciting level.
“Knight of Illusions” will give a new taste of magic to Sri Lankans with classical and modern acts, which will hope to create a desire to see more and more magic.
The prospect of learning magic is encouraging. Unlike Harry Potter magic need not be in your blood! You can learn magic. For example Yasas Gunaratne is a self-magician!
“I always wanted to do things differently and Magic has been a passion for me. My dream was to change the poor perception of magic in Sri Lanka and to take Sri Lankan magic to the International arena,” said ,” said Magician Yasas Gunaratne
“Xavier has massive talent and has enjoyed huge success in Las Vegas. He is the next generation magician. He was a natural choice. So he has agreed to perform with us. Michael Finney is more of a guru to me. I grew up watching him. He has a lot of experience. He is extremely versatile. It is a real honor for me to sit next to him.
"Then we have the young and dynamic couple – Neil Croswell and Ashely Da Silva. I am sure Sri Lankans will really enjoy their performance. They are all the way from Toronto Canada. They two are highly skilled and famous. They are young, creative and innovative. Finally I must speak about my colleague Hannibal, who is a serious comedian. He has been very supportive to me,” explained Gunaratne.
The show is important to these magicians for many reasons. It will really contribute to the progress of Sri Lankan magic at a local level and at an international level. Doing shows like this helps magic itself. It enables people to enjoy magic and believe in magic. And as mentioned before it is going to charity. This is the power of magic. To transform lives. “These shows will make Sri Lanka, a magic destination. All these magicians are performing free. Their hearts are as big as their talent. So they are dedicating their precious time to come down here and entertain us. Some day we can look back at what we have accomplished and we can be proud. If we can achieve the next generation of magic that will be really great for both the industry and for those we touch through our magic,” stated Gunaratne.
The imagination is there. The passion is there. The interest is there. The brains are here. Somewhere down the line like I said before magic could become a discipline taught in universities. One thing history has taught us is that man can attain what he imagines or conceives. If can imagine placing a colony on the moon then why can’t we have a magic school?
