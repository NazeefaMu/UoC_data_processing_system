The Sri Lanka - German Training Institute which is under construction in Killinochchi will strengthen the process for reconciliation in the country, Skills Development and Vocational Training Minister Mahinda Samarasinghe said.
He was speaking at the Unity Day celebrations of the Federal Republic of German in Colombo.
Sri Lanka and Germany enjoy 62 years of bilateral ties.
It will be further strengthened with the establishment of the German funded training institute in Killinochchi, the minister said.
