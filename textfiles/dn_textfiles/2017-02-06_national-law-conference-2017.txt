National Law Conference 2017

The Annual National Law Conference 2017 of the Bar Association of Sri Lanka (NLC) under theme “Contemplatio – A contemplation of the Law and the way forward” will be held from February 15 to 17 at the Galle Face Hotel.
The objective of the NLC 2017 is to inspect the fundamental jurisprudential basis of the law, an exploration of the law as it is presently practised from the side of the non-stakeholder, practitioner and the Judge and the future reforms that is required. It is expected that the NLC, as the pre-eminent academic/practical conference of the Bar Association, is considered both among the legal fraternity and the wider public as a more introspective forum where the participants can contemplate the way of the law and the practical aspects of the law in operation.
“Contemplatio – A contemplation of the Law and the way forward” is graced by President Maithripala Sirisena as the Chief Guest.
Another highlight of the NLC 2017 will be the Gala Dinner organized by the Bar Association of Sri Lanka on 17th February to felicitate senior attorneys, who complete 50 years at the Bar this year. The tickets for the National Law Conference will be sold at Rs.20,000.00/=(inclusive of the Gala Dinner on 17th Friday). The tickets can be purchased at BASL and from Secretaries of all member associations of BASL. Participants may contact the BASL on 0112447134/0113090030
