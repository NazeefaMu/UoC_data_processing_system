‘Where I’m today is my biggest achievement’

Actor Nargis Fakhri enjoys her work, but says she won’t let it “consume” her life. That explains the recent speculation about her quitting Bollywood for good to be with her family in New York, US. As she turns a year older today, the 37-year-old clarifies she’d come by when she has a good film offer in hand, and that life is about experiencing different things.
“For me, life isn’t about what it is for everyone else... like ‘oh career... I have to do this, I have to be married by a certain age’. It is about doing anything new that adds to my knowledge. Work is only a piece in my life. It doesn’t consume my whole life. I want to take vacations, meet friends, and spend time with family and my mother,” says Nargis.
This realisation dawned on her when recently; someone told her that she wasn’t ambitious enough. Talking about her priorities in life being different, Nargis says, “I am ambitious about life, about doing different things, meeting new people and being a positive person. My ambition is geared in a different direction so many people don’t understand it. It is not just limited to a professional sphere. Also because I grew up very poor. For me, where I am today, compared to where I came from, is my biggest achievement. I’m so proud of myself.” Hindustan Times
