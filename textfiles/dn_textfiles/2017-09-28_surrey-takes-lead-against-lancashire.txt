Surrey takes lead against Lancashire

LONDON: A fine opening stand from Mark Stoneman and Rory Burns helped Surrey regain the lead against Lancashire, for whom captain Steven Croft scored a century.
Resuming on 17-0 and trailing by 184 runs, Rikki Clarke (3-29) took three wickets as the Red Rose slumped from 68-0 to 75-4 inside six overs. Croft hit a 173-ball 115 to rescue their innings as they posted 268.
However, Surrey took lead again as Stoneman and Burns helped them finish the second day on 79-0, ahead by 12.
Champions Essex are on the verge of ending the season unbeaten after earning a first-innings lead of 116 against Yorkshire at Chelmsford.
Yorkshire, whose survival in Division One was assured on the first day, collapsed to 111 all out in 45.1 overs replying to Essex's 227 all out. Jamie Porter, Simon Harmer and Neil Wagner took three wickets apiece.
The hosts reached 134-2 at the close, leading by 250, with Dan Lawrence and Nick Browne making unbeaten fifties.
Should Essex avoid defeat in this match, they will be the second successive team to win the County Championship title without losing a game.
Middlesex, the 2016 champions, won six and drew 10 of their 16 matches last season, while Essex had nine wins and four draws from their 13 games before their final fixture of 2017.
Promotion-chasing Nottinghamshire ended day two struggling on 108-5 in reply to Sussex's mammoth total of 565 all out.
Notts, who began second in Division Two, will be promoted with five batting bonus points and a draw at Hove.
Centuries from Michael Burgess (146) and Chris Jordan (147), plus a rapid 72 from Jofra Archer, took Sussex past 500 for the third time this season. Stuart Whittingham's 3-37 reduced Notts to 65-5, before Billy Root and Chris Read steadied things until the close.
Worcestershire will go into day three against Durham needing just two points to clinch promotion back to Division One of the County Championship.
After resuming on 90-3 at New Road, the hosts looked like they might miss out on any batting bonus points at 132-5.
But Ravichandran Ashwin (82) and Ed Barnard (75) each hit their county-best score, allied to Joe Clarke's 65.
Having reached 335, the hosts then claimed a bowling point as Graham Clark (60) helped Durham close on 142-5.
Eighteen wickets fell on an eventful second day between Leicestershire and Northamptonshire, whose promotion hopes rely on winning at Grace Road.
Day one was lost to rain but Northants wasted no time in moving the game forward, reducing the Foxes to 26-7.
Ben Sanderson (5-39) and Richard Gleeson (5-49) starred, with Ben Raine (57) the hosts' only major contributor.
Luke Procter (82) gave Northants a solid start but they slipped to 199-8 by the close, leading by 71 runs.
Somerset took a big step towards avoiding relegation from Division One as they dominated day two at Taunton, taking a 253-run lead over Middlesex.
The hosts, who need to win to have a chance of avoiding the drop, dismissed Middlesex for 142, with Jack Leach (4-54) and Craig Overton (3-7) starring. James Hildreth (82 not out) put on 100 with Tom Abell (34 not out) as Somerset recovered to reach 159-3.
Hampshire's prospects of being relegated to Division Two of the County Championship increased significantly as they collapsed against already relegated Warwickshire at Edgbaston.
On a day when rivals Somerset edged into a winning position against also threatened Middlesex, Hampshire were bowled out for 116 - a deficit of 72. That was after earlier allowing their hosts to make 188, having been 28-5.
Glamorgan captain Michael Hogan reached a milestone of 500 first-class wickets in style as he hauled his side back into their game against Kent.
Kent closed day two on 98-6 in their second innings at Canterbury, a lead of 171 over Glamorgan after dismissing the visitors for 229.
Wayne Madsen and Alex Hughes both hit centuries as Derbyshire made 460 against Gloucestershire on day two.
After 70 overs were lost on day one, Madsen (121) and Hughes (142) took control, putting on a 233-run partnership to move the score to 307-3.
It was a day of landmarks for Madsen and Hughes, with the former posting his 25th first-class ton for Derbyshire and passing 10,000 first-class runs in his career, while Hughes' 142 represented a new career-best score. AFP
