Messi may retire from Argentina football

Lionel Messi flagged a potential Argentina retirement after a devastating penalty loss to Chile, ESPN reported.
On Sunday night Argentina lost 4-2 on penalties to Chile after a 0-0 draw at the Metlife Stadium.
An emotional Messi told reporters after the match that his Argentina career may be over:
"In the locker room after the game I thought the national team is over for me, this is not for me,” he is reported as having said. "I missed a very important penalty. I'm done."
Messi missed from the spot in the shootout and cut a dejected figure after the result was delivered. 
Teammates however said they were not convinced Messi would actually retire from the national team, despite the bad spell.
