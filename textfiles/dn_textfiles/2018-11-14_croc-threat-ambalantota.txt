Croc threat in Ambalantota

Crocodiles in the Walaweganga pose threats to people in surrounding areas.
A plan was mooted sometime ago to relocate the crocodiles but it has not been realised to date, residents said.
The Ambalantota Pradeshiya Sabha attempted to remove the crocodiles recently but they abandoned the effort as they have not trained staff for the task.
The residents said Walaweganga now has a large number of crocodiles.
