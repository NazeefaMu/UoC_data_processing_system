GMOA sends letter to President against SAITM representatives

 
The Government Medical Officers Association (GMOA) has sent a letter to President Maithripala Sirisena urging to take action against the officials of the Attorney General's Department who represented the Department for SAITM case.
GMOA Secretary Dr. Navin De Zoysa, addressing a press conference held at the GMOA Head Quarters in Colombo today (7) said that the GMOA requested the President to take action against the Attorney General and his lawyers who represented the department for SAITM case.
According to Zoysa, the conduct of the Attorney General and his lawyers who represented the department for SAITM during the Court of Appeal was not satisfactory at all and they acted enabling to offer legality for a private institution without required standards.
Zoysa pointed out that they failed to present accurate and relevant facts at the Court of Appeal during the hearing of the case.
Among the things that they have failed to do are, not informing the stand of the former Health Minister, now President, on SAITM issue, not appearing for the Sri Lanka Medical Council which is the state body established through a Parliament Act to protect patients' rights and not informing the Judiciary that SAITM has not obtained the Compliance Certificate.
