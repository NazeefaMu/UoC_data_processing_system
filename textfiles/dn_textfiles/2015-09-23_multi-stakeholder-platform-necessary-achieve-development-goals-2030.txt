Multi stakeholder platform necessary to achieve development goals by 2030

Creating a multi stakeholder platform is necessary to discuss and take measures to achieve sustainable development goals by 2030, Global Compact Network Director Sutheash Balasubramaniam said.
Balasubramaniam was addressing the media yesterday at Aitken Spence, Colombo.
He said all 193 member countries of the United Nations have agreed to adopt the 17 sustainable development goals which includes poverty and hunger eradication, ensuring healthy lives, promoting well-being for all, ensuring inclusive and equitable quality education and promote learning opportunities for all, achieve gender equality and empower all women and girls, ensure availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all, etc. with the intention of eradicating poverty, protecting the planet and moving towards prosperity by 2030.
“The Sustainable Development Goals will come into effect from January 1, 2016 and it is expected that all UN member countries will use them to guide and shape their policies through 2030 even though the members are not legally bound to do so,” he said.
He also said that it is necessary to raise awareness amongst Sri Lankans about the global goals and initiate dialogue between corporate sector about potential opportunities in achieving them.
Balasubramaniam said the new Sustainable Development Goals will be a road map for all countries.
Sustainable development goals also aim the continuation of the progress achieved by the eight Millennium Development Goals, adopted in 2000 which is scheduled to expire at the end of this year, he added.
Senior External Affairs Officer Sandya Salgado and Global Compact Network Contact Person and Director Rasika Withanage also spoke.
