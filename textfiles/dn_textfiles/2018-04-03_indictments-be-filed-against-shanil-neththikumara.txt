Indictments to be filed against Shanil Neththikumara

The Attorney General told the Colombo Chief Magistrate yesterday, that indictments will be filed against Shanil Neththikumara before the High Court on the alleged death threats made to the family members of Anika Wijesuriya, who revealed that an apartment had been rented out to former Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayaka, while giving evidence before the Bond Commission.
Senior State Counsel Lakmini Girihagama, appearing on behalf of the AG, submitted before Colombo Chief Magistrate Lal Ranasinghe Bandara, that charges will be filed against Sunil Neththikumara for leveling death threats on Wijitha Wijesuriya.
Lakmini Girihagama further stated that the voice recordings and the mobile phone involved were sent to the government analyst for further investigations.
Earlier, Wijitha Wijesuriya complained to the Bond Commission that Shanil Neththikumara threatened him with death following his sister Anika's controversial testimony before the Commission.
Accordingly, a case was filed against Neththikumara at the Fort Magistrate's Court.
However, later, Neththikumara had also lodged a counter complaint with the Cinnamon Gardens Police against Wijith Wijesuriya for leveling death threats on him.
The Senior State Counsel, today, pleaded with the Chief Magistrate's Court to suspend the Magisterial inquiry without taking actions against Wijith Wijeysuriya as the complaint made by Neththikumara to the police was allegedly false.
Colombo Chief Magistrate Lal Ranasinghe Bandara ordered to recall the case on May 25.
