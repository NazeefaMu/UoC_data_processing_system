The event was held at the office in Colombo.
It was a day of celebrations with the morning's proceedings commencing with everyone lighting a lamp and placing it in the pond at the entrance of the office. The traditional table of food was given a twist with food like Konda Kevum, Kokis, Mung-Kevum, Asmi and many delicious sweet items being placed around the office and members of staff having to visit each neighbouring department to enjoy them.The evening's celebrations began with boiling of the pot of milk and continued through the night with music and traditional games such as kana mutti, tug of war, passing the egg and pin the eye on the elephant, etc.
The National New Year celebration at the agency is yet another initiative at which the -agency draws upon the value of human connections.
