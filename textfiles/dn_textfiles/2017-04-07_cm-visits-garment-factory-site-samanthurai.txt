Eastern Province Chief Minister Haafis Nazeer Ahamed toured the construction site of the new garment factory being built at Sammanthurai recently and had discussion with site officials. The factory is scheduled to be opened soon.
The factory is constructed at a cost of Rs.40 million under the ‘Let us invest in the East’ programme.
It is the second in the Eastern Province opened after forming the good governance.
