How human rights shaped a novel

Before I wrote a novel, I worked as a volunteer phone counsellor, then in a local youth charity, and then writing, commissioning, and editing work on human rights abuses for an NGO. Though the offices changed, the work always began with listening to personal testimony and then providing context: the reports went into internal files or to social services. The human rights reports got published and quoted by bigger organizations such as Human Rights Watch and the US State Department.
The work took me across the UK and Northern Ireland. I went to Jordan, where people from Iraqi minority religious and ethnic communities, such as Yazidis and Mandaeans who had fled the war shared their memories with me.
In Rwanda women who had survived the genocide in 1994 brought out photographs of people they had lost.
I spent time with a group from different communities in Kosovo, who talked of the impact that the conflict in the former Yugoslavia in the 1990s had taken on their lives and their determination to build different futures.
In Srinagar I met a group of chefs preparing a wedding wazwaan (feast) in a small courtyard; they spoke of their work and daily lives as well as the effects of ongoing terror, the years of Indian Army surveillance and violence they had experienced.
Some had lost relatives: people had been “disappeared” over years and never been found. The travel my job required was extreme, which I loved, and I am still in touch with some of the people I met. But I reached a point where I had to stop.
Recorded voices
Excavating people’s trauma for work is a strange kind of life. It takes a toll on the person talking. The person listening knows this, and must continue for deadlines and money. The more I worked, the more time and memory, news and rumor, began to bleed into each other. Recorded voices said the same things over and over as I transcribed, even as my subjects’ lives were moving on. Yet the hardest part was the form in which I had to write. It felt repetitive and limited. I could only include blank facts, such as numbers of people killed, some edited interviews, and geographical and historical context. Footnotes: churned media (which showed how difficult it is to gather information in such circumstances). Human rights reports are important and necessary; we trust them to highlight abuse and to hold institutions to account. But I became exhausted. I was not alone: the mood in the organizations I worked in was constantly fraught, and our jobs were always precarious.
I had always written fiction for myself. Now I wondered if I could make something more of it. I thought it might balance my doubts about researching others’ stories and then presenting them with an “objective” eye. So I began work on We That Are Young.
The novel is based on Shakespeare’s King Lear. The play begins with the division of a kingdom, a partition that sets its characters against each other in a form of “divide and rule,” where daughters must compete for land and for a father’s love. It spoke to me of the first conflict of which I had become aware, the one that was in my family history: the 1947 Partition of India. It caused the migration of millions of people along religious lines of Hindu, Muslim, and Sikh, and the deaths of a million as well. My grandparents left their home in what is now Pakistan and went to New Delhi. My grandmother was young, and pregnant, my mother born in December that year. My parents later left India for the UK in the 1960s.
Indian freedom
Partition stories were passed down to me by my mother and aunts, and later by the poetry, myths, and tales of “home.” I read India’s great antiwar epic the Mahabharata but also books by Sidwa, Chughtai, Kushwant Singh, Sahni, Hyder, V.S Naipaul, and Salman Rushdie. The work of Indian freedom fighter Mulk Raj Anand gave context to why I had been born in England, and why my grandmother, in India, never wanted to visit us. She held the British responsible for her personal losses in 1947.
There was also the reality of the ongoing conflict in Kashmir, which began with Partition and came to a peak in the 1990s. At the time, there was little international intervention; human rights monitors have only rarely, and with limited access, been able to investigate. In the same decade, the tragedy in the former Yugoslavia was unfolding. I read the news, I heard from family: I was very aware that while my peers in the cities of Srinagar and Sarajevo were living under sanctions and siege, I was at school studying Shakespeare for my final exams.
In Kosovo they were denied access to formal education and jobs. Some took up arms to fight for independence. By the time NATO bombed Kosovo and Belgrade I had edited my student newspaper and was about to graduate university with a degree in theology. I wrote one of my finals essays on Lear.
