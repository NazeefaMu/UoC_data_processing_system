UNPers call for party convention to select leader

A group of UNP Parliamentarians, Provincial Councillors and Pradeshiya Sabha members has called for a party convention to select its candidate for the premiership.
They have sent a letter to the General Secretary of the party requesting him to uphold the party’s democracy by holding a special convention to select its Prime Ministerial hopeful.
United National Party former General Secretary Tissa Attanayake said UNP leader Ranil Wickremesinghe, who is always talking of introducing the Lichchavi administration to the country, should run the party based on democratic principles as Lichchavis of Northern India during the Buddha’s era.
“Wickremesinghe can’t talk of democracy at a time when there is no democracy in his own party,” he said.
Attanayake said President Maithripala Sirisena has announced that he will never appoint Wickremesinghe as Prime Minister and the party has to think about an alternate member.
“It is up to the party to decide who is suitable to hold the post of Prime Minister rather than Wickremesinghe,” Attanayake added.
Former Deputy Minister M. D. Premaratne said they have been advocating the party leader to step down to ensure that democracy reigns in the party for years.
“This grand old party will fall into pieces if Wickremesinghe does not step down from party leadership,” he said.
Premaratne added that Wickremesinghe destroyed democracy within the party. “This party prospered as it was based on democratic principles,” he said, adding that the party held the general convention every year when Dudley Senanayake was the leader. “The former Prime Minister has the habit of sitting with party members until the members collectively elect him as the leader every year. That was how democracy reigned in our party. These democratic norms and practices are no longer in our party,” he said.
Premaratne added that Wickremesinghe changed this practice from 1994 after Parliamentarian Ranjith Maddumabandara submitted a proposal at the UNP convention that Wickremesinghe should be in his position till his death.
A number of Parliamentarians including Deputy Leader Sajith Premadasa opposed. But this proposal was adopted despite our opposition, he said.
“The UNP cannot win an election until Wickremesinghe steps down from his party position,” he added.
Former Parliamentarian Reginald Perera said the world knows that there is no democracy in the UNP. “Parliamentarian Ranil Wickremesinghe’s policies do not suit the country. He will betray the country to remain in power,” he said.
He said the country is unfortunate to have a leader of this nature. There should be political parties and party leaders should not hang on to the party’s leadership. He should allow senior members to take over the leadership.
Perera said the present crisis can easily be solved if Parliamentarian Sajith Premadasa is appointed as the leader of the party and a convention should be held to select the next party leader for the well-being of the party,” he said.
Former Minister Upali Somasiri said people in his electorate are of the view that UNP leader Ranil Wickremesinghe does not think of the Sinhala Buddhist culture.
“They want a leader who does not betray the country. They want a leader who really loves this motherland,” he said.
He added that the UNP brought independence to the country. “The country was brought under a massive development drive under the UNP. But the party is on the verge of ruin due to the narrow policies of Ranil Wickremesinghe,” he said.
