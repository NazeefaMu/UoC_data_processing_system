The British Council expands to Matara

The British Council in Sri Lanka expanded its Partner Teaching Centre in Matara recently facilitating students to discover the English language in new and diverse ways. The institution is partnering with the Apex Business Academy for this endeavour.
The British Council is renowned for its English language teaching programmes across the world and in Sri Lanka. The institution works primarily in the areas of arts, education and society, making notable strides over the years with programmes designed to make learning fun and intellectually stimulating. The British Council’s language programme offers a wide range of courses to meet the needs of every type of learner.
The newly refurbished venue at No. 104/1B, Rahula Road, Matara is inclusive of the newest classroom facilities along with a fully equipped mini British Council Library. The courses are designed using the latest interactive and communicative teaching methods. Students’ progress is regularly assessed in all areas of spoken and written English based on classroom activities and take home assignments.
With the reopening the Apex Business Academy reaffirms its partnership with the British Council.
“British Council learners are highly motivated and use English language as a tool to communicate, learn and advance in their personal and professional lives. Our classrooms are designed to facilitate a stimulating learning environment,” Country Director British Council, Keith Davies said. He added that the institute is delighted to reiterate our commitment to the South by bringing a world class learning experience.
The launch was attended by State Minister of Public Enterprise Development, Lakshman Yapa Abeywardena, Country Director British Council, Keith Davies, the Vice Chancellor University of Ruhuna, Professor Gamini Senanayake and the principals of Rahula Vidyalaya, Sujatha Vidyalaya, St. Mary’s College Matara, S.
