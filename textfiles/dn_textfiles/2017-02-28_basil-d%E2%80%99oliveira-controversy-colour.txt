Basil D’Oliveira - controversy in colour

B.L. D’Oliveira’s cricket could never have reached first-class status and quality had he not left his native land, states J.M.Kilburn, in his book titled “Overthrows.”
As a coloured South African D’Oliveira was debarred, under apartheid law from South African national teams containing white players, points out Kilburn. The principle of separate development determined his boundaries.
D’Oliveira rose to county and international cricket in England, by bringing raw talent and uncommon resolution. He justified himself and his advocates and after six years at league and county level he played for England, thereby stirring implications too intriguing to be overlooked recalls Kilburn.
The possibilities simmered for two years. D’Oliveira stayed in the England team through 1967-68. MCC were to send a side to South Africa. Kilburn recalls that on estimates of cricketing ability D’Oliveira was a candidate for this team, but not an unquestionable selection. Neither his medium pace bowling nor his middle order batting had found much success in the West Indies nor after England had been heavily defeated in the opening match against Australia, D’Oliveira was not invited to the second third and fourth Tests. Early season speculations over consequences of D’Oliveira as an England player in South Africa had largely withered when the prospects for the tour were being discussed in mid August. Any awkwardness seems to have settled itself, purely on playing considerations.
In a week the whole situation turned turtle states Kilburn. D’Olveira was brought into the Oval test as a substitute, played an innings of 158, took a timely wicket in a dramatic English victory and so restored himself to the sporting headlines of the world.
Kilburn states that at the appointed hour the touring team for South Africa was announced without D’Oliveira. Reception was predictably controversial and impassioned. The selectors were accused of either political cowardice or myopic cricketing judgment; they were alternatively; commended for diplomatic discretion or balanced assessment of evidence derived from more than one match. There was a case for choosing D’Oliveira; there was a case for omission. As a player he has risen to a specific occasion; as a player he has been unsuccessful on tour in the West Indies and had not held an England place throughout the latest Test series. ‘Hard luck Dolly’ summed up Kilburn.
‘We in Sri Lanka are fortunate that our cricketers are not judged by the colour of their skin. They come in all hues and there are no issues.
I have had this experience firsthand by being to countries like England, Switzerland, Jamaica and Australia for lengthy stays and played cricket at different levels. I resided in England from the late sixties to early eighties, and came across discrimination in finding digs and also getting employment where my batch mates who were of course a lighter shade of pale got jobs with lesser qualifications. I also experienced reverse discrimination because my better half then was a Swiss national and we used to visit a famous pub called “Swiss Cottage.” I was targeted by the Jamaicans, the Indians and a few Sri Lankans as well in that cozy old pub; at times the so called barracking was below the belt. All this was not exactly due to discrimination but because of jealousy of me for bagging a white woman.
In Switzerland we were in Geneva and we hardly came across discrimination but there was an interesting incident where I had to stand outside a boys school in St Gallen, this was where my then wife’s home town was, suddenly a bell rang and kids of the ages between 10 and 12 poured out of the school gates and suddenly they saw this brown man standing and two of the more adventurous ones came and one held my hand firmly and the other started rubbing my hand vigorously, after some time the boy who was involved with the rubbing looked at his mates quite alarmed and yelled in Swiss German, the English meaning of it is as follows “Hey it won’t go” thinking that I have painted my skin brown, the upshot of it was that they have never seen people of different hues. Can you blame them? In Jamaica of course I was discriminated thinking that I was an Indian, so they referred to me as a “Cooley man “. At that time in the eighties in Jamaica I was working at the Scientific Research Council. And about 30% of the Jamaicans were of Indian origin, I found them to be nice and meek in comparison to the Indians in Trinidad and Guyana. The Aussies were the friendliest of the lot.
“So it takes all sorts to make a world.”
