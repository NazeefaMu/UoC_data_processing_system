Pakistan’s Azhar Ali thought ball had gone for four.....:
‘The greatest run-out of all time!’

Pakistan star Azhar Ali was run-out in comical fashion on day three of the second Test against Australia at Abu Dhabi after assuming the ball had gone for four.
In a series of events more reminiscent of club than Test cricket, Ali was left to rue his failure to remember the basics, a mistake described by Michael Vaughan as 'the greatest run-out of all time'.
The No 3 edged a ball from Peter Siddle wide of gully and with the third man area vacant presumed the ball had run away for four.
But it stopped dead inches from the boundary rope with the Australian fielders quick to notice the mishap in the middle.
Ali had not even bothered running, only glancing at where the ball had gone before taking a few steps down the track and consulting his batting partner Asad Shafiq.
Shafiq had his eyes on the ball, but he too did not notice it fall short.
The pair punched gloves and paused for a mid-pitch chat as Mitchell Starc's bullet throw from the boundary rope was received by wicketkeeper Tim Paine, who gleefully removed the bails.
Ali stared in disbelief as he was caught well out of his crease with the Australians celebrating wildly.
He reluctantly trudged back to the pavilion at the Sheikh Zayed Stadium in Abu Dhabi, with his 141-ball vigil coming to a farcical end.
Ali hit 64 as Pakistan built a substantial lead over Australia in their second innings.
His wicket left the hosts 160 for four, 297 runs ahead of the Aussies.
Azhar Ali explains the bizarre Run Out
Pakistan batsmen Azhar Ali and Asad Shafiq were involved in a bizarre run out on Day 3 of the second Test against Australia in Abu Dhabi. Cricketers and fans alike were shocked after witnessing the comical run out. Azhar, in the post match press conference, explained what happened in the middle after he edged a Peter Siddle delivery towards the third-man region.
“We were just discussing that the ball was swinging a bit late. We both didn’t actually realise something like this could happen. When Mitchell Starc threw the ball even then we didn’t think anything was happening but when it landed in the gloves of the keeper we realised something funny was happening,” Azhar explained.
“The way the shot was hit to a fast bowler and the edge flew I thought it reached the boundary. But there is no excuse. Everyone was pulling our legs in the dressing room but at that moment it was a shock,”Azhar recalled.
“We were not watching the ball and that was the reason I missed the whole sight of it. I wasn’t happy with it and thankfully other batsmen did the job and we laughed about it afterwards. It is kind of disappointing and a shock but also funny,” Azhar further explained.
“My son is going to speak about it (the run out) for a long time and in a funny way,” said Azhar of his 10-year-old son Ibtisam, who arrived at the ground after his father’s dismissal.
“Whenever I will say something about cricket he will surely come back to this incident,” Azhar said.
OTHER BIZARRE RUN-OUTS
IAN BELL:
Azhar's misfortune was reminiscent of Ian Bell's blunder against India at Trent Bridge seven years ago. The England batsman had crafted a typically stylish century and was heading towards the pavilion after believing Eoin Morgan had hit a four from the final delivery before tea.
However, Praveen Kumar had actually prevented the boundary, perhaps even unbeknown to him, and his casual throw was followed by Mahendra Singh Dhoni removing the bails. After a couple of minutes of confusion,
Bell was given out to his and the crowd's astonishment. He was ultimately reinstated following talks between the England and India camps but later admitted he had been "very naive (and) a bit stupid."
MISBAH-UL-HAQ:
Featuring in just his eighth Test against Pakistan's bitter rivals India in 2007, Misbah looked on course for his maiden international ton but his relative inexperience came back to haunt him.
Jogging through for a single, the genial batsman who would go on to become known for his unflappable temperament was on course to make his ground but jumped up at precisely the wrong moment to avoid Dinesh Karthik's throw, creating a passage for the ball to thud into the stumps and dismissing Misbah for 82.
Misbah would show his resolve over the course of the series with hundreds in the following two Tests.
AMIT MISHRA:
The Sunrisers Hyderabad leg-spinner was given ample opportunity to make his ground during a 2014 Indian Premier League group game against the Rajasthan Royals, but comically failed on all counts.
In the final over of the Sunrisers' innings, Mishra was unable to connect with James Faulkner's slower ball but set off for a bye. As he was halfway down the pitch, Sanju Samson's shy missed the stumps while Faulkner was then wayward with his throw with Mishra in no man's land.
Not satisfied with two lives, the tail-ender idled his way back towards the crease but was still inches short and looking at non-striker Irfan Pathan when Samson finally threw down the stumps.
PETER NEVILL:
Of the batsmen who have featured on this list, Nevill is perhaps the only one who escapes any blame. Dwayne Bravo was taking centre stage in a Melbourne derby in the 2015-16 Big Bash League, and looked to heave Stars leg-spinner Adam Zampa down the ground.
The Renegades batsman connected with a full toss that first ricocheted off non-striker Nevill's bat before pin-balling off Zampa's face and on to the stumps.
Nevill's immediate concern was not that he had been run-out while backing up but for the bowler, who received immediate treatment but ultimately escaped injury for his inadvertent heroics.
