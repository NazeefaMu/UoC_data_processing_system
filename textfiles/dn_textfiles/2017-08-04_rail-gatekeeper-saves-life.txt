Rail gatekeeper saves life

A railway gatekeeper had successfully foiled an attempt of an individual to commit suicide by laying on the rail tracks at Nawalapitiya, on Wednesday.
According to Nawalapitiya Police, the person had attempted to lay on the rail track when the train from Badulla to Colombo was arriving at Nawalapitiya. However, the gatekeeper had noticed this and taken immediate action to save the individual’s life by not signalling the train to pass. The gatekeeper had also informed the incident to a policeman who was travelling on his motorcycle on the road. The two had helped the individual to get off the rail track. Police said he had attempted to commit suicide due to unemployment. He was identified as a father of three, a resident of “Shamrock” Estate in Nawalapitiya.
