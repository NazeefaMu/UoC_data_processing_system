“illegal” posts in the PCs: Auditor General urged to halt expenditure

The JVP requested the Auditor General to act against spending public money on various posts in the Provincial Councils which are not legitimately recognised.
The JVP group in the Western Provincial Council yesterday made a written submission in this regard to Auditor General Gamini Wijesinghe. JVP Councillor Lakshman Nipunaarachchi, speaking to the media after handing over the complaint, pointed out that the PC Act only recognises the posts of Chairman and Deputy Chairman and five ministerial portfolios.
He therefore argued that spending public money on posts such as Leader of the House, Chief Government Whip, Opposition Leader and Chief Opposition Whip is illegal and offensive.
He said that a large sum of public money is being spent on the staff, vehicles and office rooms of individuals holding the above mentioned “illegal posts”. “The very aim of creating these posts is to have extra privileges. If the AG come forward and determine that the spending on those posts is illegal, then the PCs will have to stop them. A similar trend can be seen in the Colombo Municipal Council (CMC) and the JVP group in CMC will make a complaint regarding that to the CMC Commissioner tomorrow,” JVP Councillor Sunil Watagala said.
Councilor Nipunaarachhi further said that they would soon make another complaint to the AG asking him to hold a comprehensive audit inquiry on the construction of a new WPC building.
“We have serious doubts that a large share of money out of the contract to construct this building has gone to the pockets of WPC rulers as in the case of importing chairs. We are awaiting the results of the Governor’s inquiry on importing chairs and will proceed to make a formal complaint to the AG asking for a comprehensive audit inquiry on the whole project,” he told the media.
