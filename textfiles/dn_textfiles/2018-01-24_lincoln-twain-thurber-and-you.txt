From Lincoln to Twain, Thurber and you

“What is humour?” Asked the English teacher from her students. The students tried their best to respond by coming up with various responses.
“Humour is one form of making people smile or laugh.”
“Good, said the teacher, adding: “What more?”
“Humour is a way of saying something in a witty manner.”
“Humour is a form of comedy or farce or a situation created in order to express something in a lighter vein.”
Humour anthology
All these go to say that the term ‘humour’ or as it is spelled in the UK as humour embraces various forms. We come across humour in the form of poems or limericks, dramatic situations, comical or comic forms, jokes and wise cracks, satire and a few other forms. Humour has come to stay as a literary form which expresses to prove a point to answer a question and just for the fun. Once the American writer Beatrice Shenk de Regniers in 1965 brought out an anthology of humour titled as ‘The Abraham Lincoln Joke Book’. Lincoln had said to himself: I laugh because I must not cry.”
Lincoln had the saddest face I ever tried to paint, said Francis Carpenter, an artist. Carpenter lived in the White House while he was painting President Lincoln’s portrait. The artist cum painter Carpenter noticed that when the President fell saddest he would try to get relief by telling a joke or reading a book of humorous stories. As the compiler notes, Lincoln believed that jokes are good for children too. He thought that jokes and riddles were good fun and helped sharpen the wits.
Lincoln once agreed with a friend who said it was as important to teach jokes and riddles in school as it was to teach reading and writing and arithmetic. Walking along the area of shop soiled and second hand book stalls in London’s well known street, Tottenham Court Road, I once picked up a fascinating book titled as Composing Humour: Twain, Thurber and You (1972) compiled by Jean Sisk and Jean Saunders. As a reader, I was spellbound by the similarities and the dissimilarities of the two great humorists, Mark Twain (1835 – 1910) and James Thurber (1894 – 1961). Who is the better humorist may not be the question a reader would ask. But who is second to the other in their humorous expressions would be the question. Both of them, as humorists, excelled and taught the English-speaking world of their period of existence the most intelligent social lessons.
The anthology of humour compiled by Sisk and Saunders is meant to address the teacher and the student who so wants to understand teach and learn the literary genre humour taking into account two significant writers Twain and Thurber. The compilation is segmented into 12 short chapters clarifying basically the definition of wit and humour, examining the salient qualities that go into the making of humour. That is followed by an inquiry into the forms known as tales, jokes, jests and tall tales. In the case of Twain, some of the earliest narratives in and around Mississippi are taken into consideration the phases of getting to know the commonest masses who used humour as a form of expression to get rid of tiredness and anxiety. In this direction, the sayings of various groups of people living in the same social matrix are brought to light.
Print medium
In the case of Thurber, the creativity lies basically in the use of the print medium of the newspaper and the periodical with a mixture of the cartoon. Thurber in many ways resembled Twain, but the latter excelled in the use of humour as a social comment addressing the political issues indirectly.
Having laid down the spirit of humour in both Twain and Thurber, the two compilers raise a question from the reader. If someone were to ask you: Do you have a sense of humour, who would you say? Your immediate response would almost inevitably be “of course, doesn’t everyone have a sense of humour?”
Well, at least everyone thinks he or she has. And yet you must have had the experience of watching others laugh hilariously at some joke you didn’t think was funny, or worse still, of telling a joke that fell flat because no one laughed. Reading through the material as laid down on the subject of humour, one feels that humour is something that one should cultivate in order to get rid of various forms of ailments and anxieties caused as a result of stress, strain and tension. It is not easy as one imagines, coming back to Lincoln the President, once someone asked him who would be the next President.
He is supposed to have said:
“I cannot say for certain who will be the people’s choice for President. But to the best of my belief, it will be the successful candidate.”
