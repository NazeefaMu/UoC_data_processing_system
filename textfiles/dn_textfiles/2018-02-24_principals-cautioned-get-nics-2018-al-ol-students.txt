Principals cautioned to get NICs for 2018 A/L, O/L students

Commissioner General of Examinations B. Sanath Pujitha has sent a circular to all government and
private school heads asking them to get National Identity Cards (NICs) for the students who are to sit for the GCE (A/L) and (O/L) Examinations this year in August and December.
Many students and parents were reported to have undergone much inconvenience in previous years at the last moment as certain school heads had not taken steps to get NICs for their students in advance.
The Department has decided that A/L students should produce their NICs at examination centres to prove their identity to do away with possible frauds at examination centres in 2018.
A senior school principal in Kurunegala told Daily News that 25 mobile service programmes are to be held by the Department of Registration of Persons for students to get NICs in Kurunegala and Puttalam Districts of the North Western Province in 2018.
