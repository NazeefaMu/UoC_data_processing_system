Book wizard’s season

‘We live in deeds, not years;
In thoughts, not breaths
In feelings,
not in figures of a dial
We should count time
by heart – throbs
He most lives
who thinks most – feels noblest acts the best
Colombo International Book Fair (CIBF) is held for the seventeenth consecutive year at the BMICH from September 15 to 24. The Sri Lanka Book Publishers’ Association began this national event at the Colombo Art Gallery Complex in 1999, and held it in the year 2000 too, before it began at BMICH to hold the exhibition in an international standard; Now, CIBF is considered as one of the ‘Best Organized’ Book Exhibitions in the South-East Asia.
Essentially CIBF is more prominently an Exhibition of the “Printed Book”. Even the modern technology has brought in use of more improved devices in reading; still the printed book is the most convenient tool for reading.
You can read a book:
· Even travelling in a bus or train or even in an aero plane.
· Don’t need or any device for reading.
· Don’t need any skill except the reading ability.
· You can read a book seated, in a chair, lying on a bed or lying in an arm – chair.
· You can read a book as many pages your time permits, and read it afterwards – after few hours, few days, few weeks or few months – as you wish!

The Colombo International Book Fair is the most prominent event of the book world in Sri Lanka; Even the State Literary Festival (SLF) began in a national level in 1957, the impact of the SLF has not been the same compared to its beginning. Though the state Literary Festival is a National Festival of the book world in Sri Lanka, the participation has dropped drastically.
At this point the Colombo International Book Exhibition & Fair (CIBF) has won the hearts of the whole Sri Lankan enthusiastic general public. Last year the participants to the CIBF was more or less four hundred thousand. It has become a national literary event, that all Sri Lankans of Sinhala, Tamil and English Reading Public. They come to CIBF as in a annual ‘Pilgrimage’. The rural folk from far-far away village are the most prominent participants in the CIBF. When inquired they say that they do their savings the whole year long to buy books, they prefer.
Specially the rural women are the cream of this participants. It’s like a annual pilgrimage to them.
There are some ill hearted newspaper headings in Sinhala journals which go as follows.
· CIBF become a ‘Carnival’ for merry making to town folks.
· They won’t buy books, nor read books, but instead prefer to eat the cheap noodle cups – etc and satisfied with that.
· Though some people buy books worth thousands of rupees, they are not reading them.
· And some people come to buy exercise books quite cheaper for year long use of their school going children.
· It’s hard to find books they need, as always books on display are not arranged properly.
· The discounts or the reductions of prices of books are not equal.
· The exhibition stalls are too small to move on.
· In an International Book Exhibition, old books are sold which is not appropriate.
Some of these allegations are true to some extent; but the CIBF is an event organized solely by the private sector publishers in Sri Lanka, without any support from any government or any foreign collaboration. It’s solely by the members of the Sri Lanka Book Publishers’ Association (SLBPA) who has taken the iniative of organizing this national event of pride.
CIBF has proved the capacity of the Sri Lankan Book Publishers’ Association to organize the most colourful and most visited annual book festival for seventeen consecutive years at the BMICH itself.
Altogether there are over four hundred book exhibition stalls which cover the majority of the Sri Lankan book publishers, leading book importers, leading book traders, including some foreign publishers.
CIBF has become a meeting centre for authors and writers, artists and designers of books, printers and all related to the book world including the reading public.
There are Seminars, Workshops, Various Children activities plus entertainment programmes.
The Colombo International Book Exhibition and Fair (CIBF) has developed more or less as a Trade Fair. A broad section of the Reading Public from various social starta visit the CIBF annually; But in Common it is the love of books. Hence the CIBF is essentially a festival of the printed book.
