Minister orders documentaries  on historic sites in upcountry

Minister Dr. Sarath Amunugama summoned media personnel and other officials attached to his ministry in order to produce short television (TV) documentaries on historic places of archeological value in the upcountry.
As the preservation of such historic places that are the heart and soul of the nation’s culture—which was receding from the minds of the people—was a contemporary challenge, it was essential to produce short TV documentaries regarding them, the minister said.
It was necessary to preserve and renovate such sites, while safeguarding their archeological value. As such, all historic places in the hill country would be covered by ministerial mandate relating to the protection of the Kandyan heritage, he added.
He directed that in the first instance, such documentaries should be produced on 10 selected sites. Included in this group of 10, would be Gadaladeniya, Lankatilaka, Hindagala, Bambaragala, Medawala, Welivita, Welagama, and Hanguranketha.
The minister further said that the documentaries should also be produced under the theme of the 1818 Rebellion, with the assistance of filmmakers of the caliber of Sumithra Peries.
