‘Largest amount of money printing within last two years’

The Central Bank (CB) has never printed such a large amount of money as in the last two years, Deputy Governor Dr. Nandalal Weerasinghe said.
Such a large volume has not been printed before 2015 either and not even during CB history, Dr. Weerasinghe said.
Central Bank DG Nandalal Weerasinghe made this allegation at the Presidential Commission inquiring into the Treasury Bond Issue, yesterday. Dr. Weerasinghe said he believes that the change into an auction system when issuing Treasury Bonds had resulted in such a large amount of money being printed.
He said a hybrid system which incorporates both the auction and direct placement method is in the making under the guidance of present CBSL Governor Dr. Coomaraswamy. Dr. Weerasinghe also said technical assistance of the World Bank is sought in the process.
Dr. Weerasinghe said the decision taken by former Governor Arjun Mahendran to shock the market by raising the short and long term interest rates was an unnecessary decision. The decision to do so was a disaster, he said.
The decision to do away with the five percent penal rate and the issuance of a 30-year bond should have come as a Monetary Board decision, Dr. Weerasinghe said. “We did not see why the Central Bank wanted to tighten the monetary policy at that time when former Governor Mahendran decided to raise the interest rate,” he added.
When asked if it was necessary to give such a shock to the interest rates, Dr. Weerasinghe said he did not agree with the decision as the shock would send a wrong signal to the market and lessen the credibility of the Central Bank.
Even if the change of interest rate was necessary, it should have come as a gradual change and not as a sudden decision, Dr. Weerasinghe said.
