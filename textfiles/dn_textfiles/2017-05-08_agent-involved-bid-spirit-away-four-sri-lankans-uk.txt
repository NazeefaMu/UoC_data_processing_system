Agent involved in bid to spirit away four Sri Lankans to UK

Nearly two months after four Lankans were arrested for allegedly trying to fly off to London from the Sahar airport using fake passports, one of the two agents who allegedly tried to facilitate their passage to Europe was arrested on Friday.
The accused, Rayappen Thevakumaran (52), against whom a lookout circular had been issued, was arrested when he landed at the Mangaluru Airport on Thursday.
He was brought to Mumbai on Friday and a Magistrate’s Court sent him to police custody till May 9.
On March 10 this year, four Sri Lankans and four UK nationals were arrested for forgery and human trafficking.
The four UK nationals - Bower Oliver (27), Quillian Alan (43), Fivehats Captain (56), Warner Ann (36) - had been offered a paid trip to India and, in return, they had to help the four Lankans - Arunasalam Shuthakaran (34), Kannathasan Karththeepan (26), Gajan Chandrabalan (31) and Kandasamy Kaveenthiri (26) - to the UK. An Indian, Sunil Soni (29), who was their local contact, was also arrested.
At the Sahar airport, the UK nationals allegedly handed over their boarding passes to the Lankans who had managed to skip immigration.
The plan was to let the Lankans fly off to London on fake identities of the UK nationals their the four Brits would stay on in India on tourist visas which had been provided by Soni, police said.
“Thevakumaran was arrested after immigration officials at Mangaluru alerted us about his arrival after they identified him based on the circular issued against him,” a senior inspector of the Sahar police station, BT Mukhedkar said.”
He is one of the two who introduced the four Lankans held with the four UK nationals who exchanged their boarding passes. Soni, a salesman, had helped the agents to get SIM cards for the UK nationals,” the inspector said. - Times of India
