Luxury motorhome

For most people, the term ‘motorhome’ doesn’t exactly scream ‘luxury.’ One German company, however, is begging to differ, and they’ve just rolled out a $1.7m beast-on-wheels that makes your dad’s dingy 1973 GMC look like a Hot Wheels truck.
The Performance S is the latest model in Volkner Mobil’s lauded Performance series of motorhomes, and much like its predecessors, it’s basically a 5-star hotel that you can park wherever you like. The sleek and stunning 40-foot vehicle contains a double bed, a fully-equipped kitchen, a spacious lounge area and a heated bathroom. In case all of that just isn’t enough high society for you, the classy caravan even has a garage with an electrohydraulic lift, and it suits everything from a Ferrari to a Mercedes.
So, if you’re itching to set off on the open road, but you’re not ready to leave behind the comforts of your penthouse and your beloved Lambo, the Performance S just might be the perfect adventure vessel for you – provided you have about 2 million bucks laying around to spare.
