Point of view
Markets lost some traction this week as profit-taking on the back of tax policy concerns and initial corporate earnings weighed on the market rally since late-March.
The benchmark Index posted its largest weekly decline (~97 points) for the year, pushing the index below the psychological 6700 mark for the 1st time in two weeks.
Nevertheless, markets found support from the IMF’s approval of its 3rd EFF tranche to Sri Lanka, helping push average daily turnover levels 17% higher W-o-W to LKR0.86Bn (cf. LKR 0.73Bn last week and LKR 0.70Bn the week prior).
Turnover levels were driven largely by Institutional and Foreign interest, with Institutional investor’s returning strongly to the market this week (~52% of total market turnover relative to last week’s 38%).
Foreign investor’s meanwhile, remained net buyers on the Colombo bourse for the 25th consecutive week, driving the YTD net flows up to LKR 24.1Bn, the highest annual flow in 4 years. Foreign purchases in H1’17 have doubled relative to H1’16 (LKR 63Bn cf. LKR32Bn in H1’16), helping push the foreign investor contribution to total turnover in 2017 to 47% relative to 42% in 2016 and 34% in 2015 and crossing the 50% mark for the 1st time since 2008 in April’17.
Foreign interest in domestic equities this year has been driven both by the general recovery in global risk appetite for EM/FM assets and Sri Lanka’s lower than regional peer PER levels (ASPI: 11.5x vs. MSCI FM:14.9x and MSCI EM:16.1x). Markets in the week ahead are likely to take cues from the start of the corporate earnings season.
IMF approves thirdEFF tranche of $167.2mn
The IMF on Wednesday disbursed its 3rd tranche under its EFF facility to Sri Lanka, adding that the new Inland Revenue Act should support fiscal consolidation.
With the disbursement of the $167.2Mn tranche, a total of $501.5Mn has so far being received by Sri Lanka under the agreement which is aimed at supporting the B-o-P and the GoSL’s broad economic reform agenda. The IMF added that the country’s performance has been ‘broadly satisfactory’ and that macroeconomic and financial conditions have been stable, despite adverse weather and global market events.
The IMF also commended the authorities’ corrective actions to achieve the pre-set targets on international reserves.
In terms of fiscal performance, the IMF noted that fiscal performance has been strong and that program targets for the fiscal deficit and tax revenue have been met; the new Inland Revenue Act meanwhile, is expected to support further fiscal consolidation and make the tax system more efficient and equitable.
The IMF cautioned though that the country’s high debt burden and gross financing needs necessitate further revenue-based consolidation, adding that structural reforms on tax administration and energy pricing should enhance this process.
The IMF also noted that inflation and credit growth remain relatively high and that despite the monetary tightening in Mar’17, further tightening may be appropriate until clearer signs of lower inflation and credit emerge.
