Maternal, infant mortality rates satisfactory: Rajitha

Around 30 mothers die in Sri Lanka for every 100,000 deliveries and only around eight infants die for 100,000 live births. Both maternal and infant mortality rates in Sri Lanka is very satisfactory when compared with other developing countries in the world, Health Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne said.
According to Minister Senaratne, Sri Lanka has already achieved an excellent improvement in the region when it comes to lowering maternal and infant mortality. The existing challenge is reducing the rates further, which is a very difficult task. He was addressing the Annual General Meeting of the Perinatal Society of Sri Lanka held in Colombo recently.
Minister Senaratne pointed out that more attention should be paid to the health of pregnant mothers and infants in order to further reduce maternal and infant mortality rates. “I will extend my fullest support towards all the programmes implemented by the Sri Lanka Perinatal Society,” he said.
Minister Senaratne specially admired the programmes led by Dr. Kapila Jayaratne to educate the public and train health staff. Minister Senaratne also launched the new web site of the society.
