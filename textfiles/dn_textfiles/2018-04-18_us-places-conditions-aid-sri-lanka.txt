U.S. places conditions on aid to Sri Lanka

The United States government’s bilateral economic assistance to Sri Lanka is conditional on certain transitional justice mechanisms being established, according to the U.S. spending bill passed last month.
In an explanatory statement attached to the spending bill, Congress said that the USD 35 million would be allocated to Sri Lanka “provided, that such funds shall be made available for programmes to assist in the identification and resolution of cases of missing persons.”
The bill says that the money will only be made available to the government of Sri Lanka if the U.S. Secretary of State certifies that it is following certain transitional justice mechanisms.
These include repealing laws that do not comply with international standards for arrest and detention by security forces, investigating allegations of arbitrary arrest and torture, supporting a justice mechanism as identified by the United Nations Human Rights Council, and returning military-occupied lands in war-affected areas to their original owners.
In addition, the US government called for “substantially reducing the presence of the armed forces in former conflict zones” and restructuring the military for a peacetime role that aids in reconciliation.
The bill also states that USD 500,000 in military assistance can only be used in humanitarian and disaster response preparedness and maritime security.
If the Sri Lankan military wants to use money for international UN peacekeeping operations, like a recent group sent to Lebanon, it must show that it is “taking effective steps to bring to justice Sri Lankan peacekeeping troops who have engaged in sexual exploitation and abuse,” the bill reads.
The U.S. Embassy in Colombo was not immediately available for comment on Tuesday.
