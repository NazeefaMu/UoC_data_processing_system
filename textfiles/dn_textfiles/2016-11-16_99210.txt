The unique triumvirate

When Rangana Herath took five wickets for 89 in the first innings of the second Test against Zimbabwe at Harare he joined a select band of bowlers who had five-for innings hauls in a Test against all Test-playing countries. He joined the elite ranks of fellow countryman Muthiah Muralitharan and South African fast bowler Dale Steyn who had done it before him. When Herath followed up his first innings bowling performance with another tantalysing spell that brought him figures of 8 for 63 it took him past 350 wickets playing in his 75th Test and made him the oldest player to achieve the feat at the age of 38. Amongst the spinners to reach this figure Herath was the second fastest to that mark after Muralitharan who did it in 66 Tests. He is also only second to Muralitharan for the number of 12-wicket hauls in Tests. Herath has five to Muralitharan’s six.
Few would have given Herath, a left-arm spinner of repute the chance to come this far considering the fact that he has since making his Test debut in 1999 been entirely in the shadow of the great Muralitharan with opportunities to play in the national team few and far between. With Muralitharan and left-arm fast bowler Chaminda Vaas reaping the harvest for Sri Lanka between 1994 and 2009, there was hardly any room for two spinners in the team. Even if there were, it was very seldom.
In the circumstances Herath’s outstanding talent as a left-arm spinner was relegated to playing domestic cricket and the odd tours with the Sri Lanka ‘A’ teams. In fact his first 11 years of Test cricket was confined to only 22 Tests and 71 wickets. The turning point of his career came in the home series against Pakistan in 2009 when he received an SOS from Sri Lanka Cricket to replace Muralitharan (who had a knee injury) in the first Test at Galle. Herath at the time was playing premier league cricket in Staffordshire and barely 24 hours after arriving in Galle he was drafted into the team. What a performance he came up with! Pakistan needing 168 runs in the fourth innings to go 1-0 up in the three-Test series closed the third day at 71-2. No one gave Sri Lanka a ghost of a chance to win but Herath conjured up an improbable victory with a spell of 4 for 15 off 11.3 overs as Pakistan were flattened for 117 and Sri Lanka won by 50 runs. It was his best bowling effort in a Test innings at the time and earned Herath his first Man-of-the-Match award. He was to go and win a further nine Man-of-the-Match awards in Tests and on each occasion Sri Lanka has finished on the winning side.
Herath didn’t have to wait long for his first five-for in a Test innings when he again produced another match-winning bowling performance in the second Test at the P Sara Oval taking 5 for 99 to give Sri Lanka a winning 2-0 lead in the series.
Despite his wonderful performance against Pakistan where he picked up 15 wickets in the three-Test series Herath’s place in the team was yet uncertain with Muralitharan still being around. It was not until the following year when Muralitharan bid goodbye to Test cricket that Herath found himself projected as the leading spinner in the team. He grabbed the opportunity which he had waited patiently for over a decade with both hands and his career figures since Muralitharan’s retirement bear testimony to the fact that he could have achieved more if the opportunities had come his way regularly. His last 53 Tests Herath has amassed a healthy total of 280 wickets bowling Sri Lanka to a series win on seven occasions in the past three years.
If Muralitharan was known as the “Smiling Assassin” Herath would easily slip into the title as the “Silent Assassin” for seldom does he react so much on the field as other bowlers do when they take a wicket. He is also in fact a quite personality to talk to and is hardly projected in the limelight as a superstar. But quietly in his own silent way he delivers with deadly results.
To be up among the best with Muralitharan and Steyn is justifiable reward for his persistency. Perseverance has been the hallmark of Herath’s career and now it is paying him great dividends. With his crocked knees for which he sustains himself with a lot of vitamins and at times pain-killers one can never tell how long Herath can keep himself going. He has already retired from the two shorter formats of the game – 50 overs and T20 to concentrate on Test cricket and give himself a better chance to prolong his international career.
Whichever way you look at it Herath has stamped his name as one of the greatest left-arm spinners the game has ever produced. He is only 12 wickets shy of becoming the most prolific left-arm spinner in Test history. New Zealand’s retired spinner Daniel Vettori holds the record with 362 wickets from 113 Tests. Herath is also five wickets short of surpassing Chaminda Vaas’ tally of 355 wickets and becoming Sri Lanka’s second most prolific wicket-taker in Tests after the legendary Muralitharan.
