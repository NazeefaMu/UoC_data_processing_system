‘Illicit meat-peddling goes unabated’

A number of truck drivers using the Elahera Road to transport sand, had been involved in numerous illicit activities, residents said.
Residents said that they were transporting illicit meat, timber and drugs concealed in the sand, at night, adding that it had been ongoing for a year.
When questioned, a police spokesman said that immediate measures would be taken against the culprits.
