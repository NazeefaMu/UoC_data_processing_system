[APPRECIATIONS - (16-11-2015)]

Soma Edirisinghe:
You will continue to live in our hearts forever
Kissing her forehead a few weeks ago, I whispered, "I love you, archcha". Then I left the hospital bed she was laying in after she whispered "bye darling".
Little did I know, this would be our last goodbye. It breaks my heart to know she's gone, and I find myself secretly shedding tears when I am reminded of her. But more than anything, I am hopeful. Let me tell you why.
What can I possibly say about Sri Lanka's sweetheart that hasn't already been said? Most people know her as a phenomenal businesswoman and philanthropist who wholeheartedly served the people of Sri Lanka.
They call her Deshabandu, they call her Deshashakthi, and they even call her Doctor. But there are only 12 individuals including myself who have the privilege of calling her "archchi".
While the media constantly reminds us of her superhuman efforts in the fields of business and philanthropy, to me, she was simply "archchi", the only grandparent I had the privilege of meeting.
I wouldn't be lying if I said that my siblings, cousins, and I sometimes had to make "unofficial" appointments to meet her; but when we did, we ended up having the best of times.
She certainly wasn't a conventional grandmother. I mean, how many grandmothers would ask their grandchildren to read her autobiography when they ask her to recite a story of her childhood?
Soma Edirisinghe would never do such a thing, but my archchi did. She spoiled us with the best birthday presents and her beautiful spacious garden was the venue to all our parties. She was witty, loving, and caring in her own unique way, and we loved her immensely.
My archchi lived an amazing life. And when she wasn't busy serving the people of Sri Lanka, she would take the time teach me a lesson or two.
She instilled in me the notion that the effort you put in is what you get out. There is no dream too big to achieve, no task too difficult to accomplish, and no challenge too daunting to overcome.
Life is what it is. She warned me that I would encounter setbacks. But more importantly, she made me promise that when I do, I will accept them, learn from them and push on.
Success requires toil and perseverance, as does any great goal worth struggling for - my grandmother is a testament to this. But most importantly, archchi taught us the importance of serving and appreciating those around you, and in doing so she inspired us to be the best that we can be. And that is exactly what we will do.
My siblings, cousins, and I certainly have big shoes to fill, but with you watching over us, we know that the sky is the limit. And while I wish I get to say "I love you, archcha" one more time and see your smiling face, I find peace in knowing that you are right there beside me saying "don't worry darling, I know".
You may have left us now, but you will continue to live in our hearts forever.
I love you Archcha!

M.A. Nawaz:
A dedicated social worker
The janaza of Alhaj Mohamed Arif Nawaz, a senior Vice-President of the Moors' Islamic Cultural Home, took place at the Kuppiyawatte Muslim burial grounds, Colombo on November 11, 2015) amidst a large and distinguished crowd.
He was 79 years and leaves his wife and three children - two boys and one girl.
A dedicated social worker and Islamic activities, Nawaz was deeply involved in the social uplift and religious activities of the MICH.
He took a keen interest in the welfare of the old and other destitute housed at the Makola Home for the Aged.
In fact, just two days before his death he had visited the Makola Home with Chairman M. Mohideen Rajabdeen and had attended to the wants and requirements of the inmates.
He throughout his life, showed an abiding interest regarding problems faced by the Muslim community, and involved himself in solving them through the Home.
He also helped the MICH in attaining international standard in billiards and snooker, and was the manager when M.J.M. Lafir won the World Billiards Championship - the first Sri Lankan to crown himself as a World Champion in any sport - in Bombay in 1973.
As one who was keenly interested in building up a strong media, he was closely associated with some of the well-known journalists at that time and backed to the hilt the launching of AL-ISLAM tabloid edited by journalist Hamza Haniffa of Lake House fame.
While conveying my deepest condolences to his wife and family members and the MICH President Omar Kamil and members of the Home, I say my fervent Du'a is for the good soul of M.A. Nawaz to enter the eternal sanctuary of the Jennathul Firdous!

P.K.S.Mohideen:
A man with extremely good qualities
Born on May 26, 955 , basic education in your native place, then in Madras (now Chennai) you worked for an industrialist in Bombay (now Mumbai) married me and settled in Sri Lanka as a successful businessman till your last breath.
We married on September 1, 1985. As my father was a strong Indian he was adamant in giving his daughters in marriage to Indians, so this is how my life with you started.
You were not a most important person nor a very important person, but a very very simple ordinary man dressed in a white cotton half sleeved shirt.
Wherever you went, whatever function it may be, you were easily spotted in your white shirt.
Life with you was just wonderful, words are not enough to pen. You were a very down to earth person with good qualities. You had the talent to handle everything single handed and you helped uplift many families.
The relationship you had with your staff and customers was great.
You will be magnified and multiplied in the creator's rank. Your dedication and devotion in your business took you to the top most level.
I had a very good happy and contented life with you from 1985-2014. Only a child was missing in our married life but that in your version "Having a child is not a profit and not having a child is not a loss".
I finally followed you quiet happily what the creator 'destined' for us. Life without you is boring, dark and lonely.
You were my inspiration in giving charity. You are not a personality to be forgotten.
Your memories are like pressed flowers in my thought. My prayers and duas for you to be my husband even in Jannah (paradise).
F.B.Mohideen.
N.C. Peiris :
You were mother and father to us
It's hard, very hard to pen all that you are to me and my family. You were both mother and father to us. The many times I miss you I feel you are right near me. You are a memory that will never fade.
As I returned to the land you loved, the land of the Menorah, to me, you were here. The words you spoke resounded within me, a gong that will not be silenced with time. Time stood still, as I heard your voice, the things you said just flooded my mind. I thought time will heal, I guess that it is just a phrase.
No one can ever replace you. Your love and faithfulness to God and family is fast fading in the modern world of selfishness and injustice.
I am blessed to have had a father - so selfless and kind. You were always there for me, you understood me.
The things you spoke are etched within me- an Eternal Monument portraying Faithfulness to Yahweh.
Dada, until we meet again in the sweet bye and bye, I pray I will be faithful to El Shaddhai as you were. ". For the trumpet will sound, and the dead will be raised imperishable,
Then will come to pass the saying,
"O death, where is your victory? O death, where is your sting?" (1 Corinthians 15:55)
