Colombo Courtyard, travellers’ choice

Colombo Courtyard has been announced a winner of the 2017 TripAdvisor Travellers’ Choice Awards for Hotels, ranking in its top 1 percent, and as one of the top 25 hotels in Sri Lanka, TripAdvisor stated.
For the 15th year, TripAdvisor has highlighted the world’s top properties based on the millions of reviews and opinions collected in a single year from travellers around the globe. Winners were identified in the categories of Top Hotels, Bargain, B&Bs and Inns, Luxury, Service and Small Hotels. The hallmarks of Travellers’ Choice winners are remarkable service, quality and value.
TripAdvisor is one of the world’s top review sites. Used as a platform for guests and clients to voice their opinions on places they have visited, the site offers a chance for people to see an organization from the perspective of its clients, rather than from the perspective of the hotel itself. With an increase in the trend of customers looking for more ‘real’ views on products and services, rather than classic forms of marketing, a TripAdvisor review can potentially make or break a business.
This is Colombo Courtyard’s second consecutive Traveller’s Choice Award, though the Hotel has been awarded TripAdvisor’s certificate of Excellence annually since its inception.
“We are humbled to be recognized in the top 1% of Sri Lankan Hotels two years running,” says Arun Thapar, Managing Director of Colombo Courtyard. “We would like to thank our guests for taking the time to rate and review us. Our mission is to ensure our guests are happy and comfortable at our hotel, and nothing can be more motivating and rewarding than feedback from our customers.”
Colombo Courtyard, South Asia’s first CarbonNeutral City hotel, is an urban boutique hotel that perfectly captures a fusion of contemporary style with the essence of environmental design. Art and elements, with the extensive use of recycled material, dashes of vivid colour and a sense of space, are all thrown in together to create a striking impact.
With open courtyards and water bodies, the Hotel boasts Deluxe, Superior Deluxe Rooms and Suites – each uniquely designed and stocked with all the necessary amenities, from a well stocked mini bar, to an iMac in every suite.
The hotel also has three dining venues - Amber Poolside, Cloud Cafe and Scarlet Room; Loft Lounge Bar - its contemporary Bar, and Grape Expectations - a cellar/lounge lined with wines that can be appreciated by any connoisseur. The Hotel also has a library and meeting room; a business centre; a Jacuzzi, plunge pool and Gymnasium. Adding to this relaxing getaway is Amber Spa, where authentic Balinese treatments can be received between 9am and 9pm. However, it’s the artistic, rustic elements that really grab your attention in this eco-friendly urban hideaway.
Colombo Courtyard is the ideal urban getaway for the busy business traveller looking to be centrally positioned in the city, while also being the perfect getaway for the leisure traveller looking to take in the sites, while also having a relaxing escape just a walk away from it all.
