FM focuses on improving ‘soft infrastructure’ in driving economy forward

Minister of Finance and Media Mangala Samaraweera who is currently attending the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank’s (AIIB) Annual Meeting in Jeju Islands, South Korea, held discussions with the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Strategy and Finance of the Republic of Korea, Kim Dong-yeon.
These discussions focused on issues of mutual interest and underscored the importance of closer bilateral relations between the two countries.
The Minister has also pointed out that they are focusing on boosting investments to make the country an export-driven economic and financial hub of the Indian Ocean,
“This is by improving its soft infrastructure,” the Minister said.
“Developing physical infrastructure must be done along with administrative and legal frameworks to ensure required policy or regulatory support to streamline and boost public and private investments,” Samaraweera said at a meeting of China-led Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank in Korea.
 
Sri Lanka was aiming to be an export-driven economic and financial hub of the Indian Ocean, with a high level reform agenda in key sectors of the economy to help the private sector drive growth.
“If we are to meet this challenge, we must incorporate climate-resilient concepts into all future infrastructure development projects,” Minister Samaraweera had said.
