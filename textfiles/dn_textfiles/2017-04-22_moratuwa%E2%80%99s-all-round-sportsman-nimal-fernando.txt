Moratuwa’s all-round sportsman Nimal Fernando

Former Moratu Vidyalaya athletic and volleyball captain, cricketer and soccer player, Air Lanka and Police athlete and Ceylon athlete and Retired Senior Superintendent of Police Nimal Fernando spoke to the Daily News about his school, Air Lanka and Police sports career at his residence at 137, “Sirisanda”, Galle Road, Moratuwa.
Q : What is your full name, date of birth and your first school?
A - My full name is Merennege Chandra Nimal Fernando and I was born on 23 October 1939 at my ancestral house in Moratuwa. I had my entire education at Moratu Maha Vidyalaya and during my whole career my Principal was A. M. de Silva. I entered college in 1945 and left in 1958.
Q : Who are your parents and something about your family?
A - My father is Merennege Justin Fernando and during his heyday he was a fine tennis player and my mother is Grace Victoria Fernando. My father was a Post Master and my mother is a housewife. My elder brother late Nihal Fernando, younger brother Mohanlal and younger sister Srimathie were all doctors.
Q : How did you commence your athletic career?
A - My forte is athletics. I captained the college volleyball team and represented my alma-mater at cricket and soccer and I won colours in all four sports. During my period we had Junior Cadeting but I was not much interested. We were living very close proximity to our college not even 100 yards. Those days our school commenced at 8.00 a.m. and closed at 3.00 p.m. and most of the time I was at the grounds with my school friends.
Q : How did you commence athletics?
A - I was really interested in athletics. I started from under ten and I was the under 12, 14, 16 and under 19 athletic champion. I started with 75 yards and 100 yards and later I did 200, 400 yards and high jump. When I was 16 years our prefect of games Mr. Ranasuriya introduced pole vault at school. I took up to pole vault, 400 and high jump. At the Western Group South Meet I became champion for two consecutive years in 1957 and 1958. I set a meet record in pole vault in 1958 and that record is still unbroken. We won the 110x4 and 440x4 yards relays and our relay team consisted of Lakshman de Alwis, Gamini Perera, Linton Perera and myself.
Q : Did you take part at Public Schools?
A - Yes. But I could win only the 400 yards flat race. I was awarded Public Schools Colours.
Q : After leaving school what was your first employment?
A - I joined Air Lanka and during this period the Ceylon athletic team was invited for the Invitation Malaysian Championship in 1960 and our captain was A. S. M. Khan. We were the runner-up in the 4x440 relay and I came second in the 400 yards. I won the Ceylon athletic colours. In 1962 I joined the Police Department as a Sub Inspector.
Q : Did you take part for the Police in athletics?
A - I did 400, pole vault and 400 meters hurdles. Late DIG Arthur Dep used to come to the Police grounds to help the Police athletes at the Police Park and seeing me participating in the hurdles he advised me to concentrate on that event. He gave me the finer points.
Q : What are your achievements in athletics at Police?
A - I was the champion athlete in 1963 and 1964 at the Inter Division Police Meet. I did 400, Pole Vault and 400 meters Hurdles. I was awarded Knollys Shield and I erased the record of Duncan White’s record 56.1 seconds by clocking 56.3 secs at the Police Meet in 1964. Later I clocked 51.3 secs and this record is unbroken for the last 54 years.
In the 400 meters I bettered Duncan White’s record at the Jaffna AAV versus CT&FC Meet in Jaffna. There are several records under my belt. I was the fifth runner-up to Michael Tissera at the Sports Star of the Year Contest sponsored by Horlicks.
Q: You said you won the Knollys Shield?
A - I won it twice. Since 1902 todate Police have named sixteen great stalwarts in athletics for their National Achievements and I am one of them.
Since the inauguration of the Police Meet 59 policemen have won the Knolley’s Shield which is awarded to the Best
Athlete of the Meet and I won it twice in 1963 and 1964. The oldest record for the Police Inter Division Athletic Meet is still unbroken - the 400 meters hurdles established by me in 1963.
Q : Recently the Police had the Inter Division Athletic Meet and were you invited?
A - For the last 54 years I was invited for this meet because I am the holder of the 400 meters hurdles record. In 2009 at the 75th Police Athletic Meet (Diamond Jubilee) I was awarded a memento for the outstanding contribution made to Police athletics by the Police Sports Club.
Myself, Lakshman de Alwis, Senaka Wijenayake all three Moratuwites founded the Ceylonese Track and Field Club and our first President was B. R. de Silva. In the Dual Athletic Meet with Ace Athletic Club in 1961, Senaka, Lakshman, Airman K. C. Perera and myself set a new Ceylon record for 4x440 yards with a timing of 3 minutes 22.7 seconds.
Q : You mentioned earlier that you played soccer, volleyball and cricket whilst at school?
A - Yes. I was a left arm medium pace opening bowler for three successive years in the first eleven team. I played soccer for the first eleven and I captained the volleyball team and we were the District champions in 1956/57. In 1958 in the All Island finals for the Lankadeepa Trophy we lost to Gampaha District.
Q : What is your advice to up and coming young athletes?
A - Not only athletes every one should be disciplined initially. During my Police career I have met a lot of learned people and most of them are not disciplined. Next comes the studies and finally you must do a sport so that you will be a balanced person.
