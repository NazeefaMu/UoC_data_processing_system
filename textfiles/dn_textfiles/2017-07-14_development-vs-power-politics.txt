Development Vs power politics

Uma Oya debacle has once again focused attention on the much talked about contradiction between development and environmental preservation. Politicians who vie for mega projects for reasons other than national interest often challenge environmentalists whether they want to sacrifice development for the sake of environmental preservation. In their opinion certain destruction of the environment is inevitable in development. Yet what is hidden is a more sinister factor –power politics of politicians. Uma Oya project is a classic example of the destruction caused by the neglect of environmental feasibility and public interest. Suffice to say that opposition by the people of the area affected by the project was even considered as acts of ‘treachery’.
The large-scale destruction of houses numbering seven thousand or so, the dislocation of the population and the drying of water resources have caused an immense humanitarian crisis. It has been now revealed that the project has technical faults, especially in the construction of the tunnel which was hailed as an engineering marvel. Moreover, since about 70 percent of the work has been completed it cannot be abandoned without colossal economic loss. Thus it has become a fait accompli.
It is said that the objective was to divert waters to the Hambantota district. Obviously the former government would have thought it politically advantageous and expeditious. However, there were other viable solutions to improve the water supply to that district. For example, the comprehensive development of the Gin ganga and Nilwala ganga projects, for which foreign expert advice was already at hand and the integrated development of a series of reservoirs connecting and channeling the waters of the Kalu ganga, Gin ganga and Nilwala ganga to the Hambantota area would have solved the water scarcity there.
Humanitarian problems
Power politics has always been a bane of development. For example, the original proposal of the Soviet Union to divert waters of the Mahaweli to the North was abandoned due to the short-sighted and communal politics of those who were in power. Besides the Mahaweli project telescoped to be completed in 30 years on an express schedule had ignored the damage to the water table in the hill country. Concerns of experts on the possibility of land slide dangers were brushed aside with contempt. In this respect one should mention the life-time contribution of Dr. S A Wickremasinghe, former MP and Communist Party leader.
The hurried and partly completed Nilwala ganga project resulted in massive flooding in the Matara district. Both local and foreign expert opinion was ignored. Patch-work remedies that are applied even today are giving rise to more humanitarian problems.
What is most striking is the piece-meal approach to the development of water resources. There should be a holistic approach taking into concern the totality of water resources, development needs and the humanitarian factors.
The contradiction between environmental preservation and power politics is not confined only to such mega projects. Even smaller projects suffer from the same ailment. Take for example, garbage disposal. The dumping of Colombo garbage in Meetotamulla without concern for environmental degradation and the attendant health and other humanitarian issues ultimately caused a huge disaster when dozens perished and hundreds were displaced. Keeping Colombo clean at the expense of suburbs can be politically favourable but on the whole disastrous.
Election times
The same is true of highway projects. Sometimes original proposals are truncated to suit political interests of the ruling dispensation with a view to gain electoral advantages. That is why deadlines for project completion often coincide with possible election times.
It is tragic that even at present when disasters of immense magnitude have occurred politicians still engage in competing with each other to prove who is guiltier and who is more responsible for them.
The opposition of the Joint Opposition on the Uma Oya issue is a comedy since it was they who originally initiated and carried out the project and hence responsible for its faults. That does not however, exclude the present rulers who also blindly followed the original plan without heeding public warnings.
Actually all post-independence governments up to now are responsible for the errors and omissions in development activities.
Uma Oya disaster once again shows the necessity of consulting all stakeholders including the vulnerable population in designing development projects instead of imposing them from above in a bureaucratic manner.
