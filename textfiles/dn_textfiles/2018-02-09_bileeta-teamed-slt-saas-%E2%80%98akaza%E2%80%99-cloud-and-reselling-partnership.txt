Bileeta teamed up with SLT for SaaS on ‘akaza’ Cloud and reselling partnership

Sri Lanka’s leading world class enterprise solutions provider and the licensed national backbone network operator, Sri Lanka Telecom PLC (SLT) strengthened its Cloud Platform, “akaza” portfolio with signing an agreement with Bileeta (Pvt) Ltd to resell the EntutionCloud ERP solution to the SME and Mid-Market in Sri Lanka and globally.
This is one of the many hallmark partnership initiatives embarked under the AkazaCloud Program.
The Cloud ERP enables customers to quickly deploy the modules they require through a self-service portal, and seamlessly add other modules, through Customer ‘Journeys’, as and when the requirement arises in customer enterprise resource management.
Cloud ERP is deployed on the Akaza Cloud Platform, a secure cloud platform hosted by SLT Data Center, providing secure scaling of infrastructure and resources in computer, memory, storage and connectivity, to provide secure access to information for fast decision making regardless whether you are accessing from office or from a mobile phone.
Significantly the customer will get a single bill for all subscribed services under the present billing relationship, with the customer having the facility to pay for subscription via the Payment Gateway. Akaza Cloud Program has presently in its growing partnership portfolio, solutions catering to Enterprise E-Learning, Hosted PABX, Omni Channel Contact Centre, and Hosted email and messaging, and firewall as a service.
Cloud ERP Product - Entution is a cost-effective cloud based ERP solution which can be implemented within a reasonably short time span and can also reduce hardware, infrastructure and maintenance expenses by hosting the application on a public cloud. Entution ‘Journeys’ is a revolutionary concept created by Bileeta which can help our customers understand their business journey within Entution. This concept will help the customers simplify and better understand their business processes when mapping their requirements into Entution. It also gives the customers a 360 ° view of their business and can identify constantly evolving processes and scalability requirements based on the Journey.
Speaking on this partnership, Sanji De Silva, CEO of Bileeta (Pvt) Ltd. Said, “We are happy to partner with Sri Lanka Telecom to serve and empower the SMEs in Sri Lanka. Bileeta’s Entution on Akaza platform will enable SMEs to digitally transform their business and gain the benefits of cloud and mobile technologies. They will not have invested large sums of moneys to automate their business operations. They can streamline their finance, inventory management, sales and customer relation management easily and save costs and be more profitable.”
M.I. Deen, General Manager, Enterprise Solution of SLT said, “The primary importance of software as a Service (SAAS) and a software delivery mechanism is the fact that it shifts enterprise focus from deploying and supporting software applications to using the applications as-a-service to extract strategic value to the company. Deploying complex enterprise software such as ERP and CRM applications require a significant investment in physical infrastructure, licensing costs, as well as a large team of skilled IT personnel to integrate the software with existing systems and data. This results in a financial burden to the enterprises’ activities which are not core to the enterprise businesses. With Akaza ERP, this problem is alleviated as SLT in conjunction with Bileeta will look at the customer requirements holistically from design, migration, deployment, integration, maintenance stages in the Cloud ERP initiative.”
