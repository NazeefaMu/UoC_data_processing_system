Fasting Sri Lankan Tamils arrested

Eight Sri Lankan Tamils who have been on fast in a special camp in  India since the beginning of this month, were arrested on Thursday. Cases have been booked against them for attempting to commit suicide. They went on fast on October 1, demanding their release from the camp that houses 13 Sri Lankan Tamils.
They were produced before a Judicial Magistrate and were subsequently admitted to the Mahatma Gandhi Memorial Government Hospital in view of their health condition.
The Sri Lankan Tamils were housed in the special camp as cases under the Explosive Substances Act and human trafficking were pending against them. (The Hindu)
