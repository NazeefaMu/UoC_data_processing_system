Two LTTE suspects acquitted, released

The Colombo High Court yesterday ordered to acquit and release two LTTE suspects from a case filed against them for conspiring to kill VIPs including former President Mahinda Rajapaksa and former Army Commander Sarath Fonseka in 2009.
While handing out a judgement against the two accused, High Court Judge Sampath Abeykoon observed that the prosecutors had failed to prove the accused guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.
The two accused Kanagaratnam Adithyan and Sandanam Gokulan alias Kanna were indicted by the Attorney General for conspiring, aiding and abetting to kill former President Mahinda Rajapaksa, former Defence Secretary Gotabhaya Rajapaksa and former Army Commander Sarath Fonseka during the Independence Day ceremony in 2009.
