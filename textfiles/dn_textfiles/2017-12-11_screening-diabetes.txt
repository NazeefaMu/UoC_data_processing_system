Screening for diabetes

MyDoctor.lk recently organized a free event in partnership with Diabetasol parallel to the “World Diabetes Day” at the Bambalapitiya flats- Community Center, to screen, educate the participants and to address the common problems related to diabetes.
The purpose of screening was to identify asymptomatic individuals who are likely to have diabetes. MyDoctor conducted blood sugar test, BMI assessment, blood pressure assessment and arranged consultation with a doctor to review the results and advice the patients. Physiotherapists and Nutritionists were invited to provide counselling for patients. Assessment for Diabetes Neuropathy (nerve damage), Diabetes Retinopathy (Damages in Eyes due to Diabetes) and assessment for spectacles were also comprehensively arranged.
MyDoctor facilitated “On site video conferencing” for individuals who were detected to have serious issues, enabling them to speak to a Diabetes specialist, who was not at the location.
Healthy foods were introduced as exhibits and ways to prepare them in a hygienic manner was demonstrated by dietitians.The event concluded by rewarding competition winners from the MyDoctor diabetes day facebook competition.
