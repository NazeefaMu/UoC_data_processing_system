SLACTA gets going

SLACTA is the Sri Lanka Aquatic Coaches and Teachers association, the first coaches association of Sri Lanka founded by an Australian National Anita Kilmeir in 1999.
He has managed to harness the support of a number of leading swimming coaches like Mahesh Karunaratne a former national coach and the present head coach of SSC swimming, Kanchen Rajapakse a well known swimmer in the 80s. He has won events like the NAASU (the parent body of swimming) organized 2 mile sea swim at Mount Lavinia and the 2 mile sea swim organized by the sports council of Dharmasoka College Ambalangoda. He also won the annual six mile sea swim organized by the Kinross Swimming and Life Saving club. He represented Sri Lanka in the only international swimming meet in 70s and 80s, the Sri Lanka, India, Bangladesh triangular meet. Another recruit is S.K. Pathmasiri who has won the six mile sea swim and the pentathlon championship. Another person is Mahesh Karunaratne;'s brother Priyantha who is an upcoming coach at the SSC.
However his biggest recruit is Ranil Goonesena a coach who has completed 43 years of coaching, perhaps the most senior swimming coach is Sri Lanka. Ranil was the national swimming coach of Sri Lanka for the SAF games held in Katmandu Nepal in 1999. He is the first non-American to be certified as a level 4 coach of the American Swimming Coaches Association. He has a number of national swimmers to his credit. He is also the first recipient of the coach of the year trophy awarded by SLACTA. Karunaratne is the second recipient of this trophy.
Janaka says that Ranil accepted the post after much persuasion on a temporary basis until SLACTA is on its feet. Janaka says that it is a well known fact that Ranil's knowledge on the theoretical aspects of biomechanics and the physiology applicable to the sport of swimming is very high and he will be spearheading the technical side of swimming in SLACTA.
As a start SLACTA has decided to conduct a two day seminar on the 6 and 13 of August. One the first day the proceeding swill start with a 1 ½ hour lecture by Dr. Tushantha Wijesinghe well known for curing sports injuries. Dr Wijesinghe is a doctor in sports and exercise medicine and holds a diploma in sports medicine, works at the sports and exercise medicine unit and at the national hospital in Sri Lanka.
Dr. Wijesinghe's lecture will be followed by a lecture on the bio mechanics of swimming by Ranil Goonesena. He will be presenting easy to undrestand theory of resistive and propulsive forces that will help coaches to design roper techniques of strokes. This kind of lecture will even be helpful to senior swimmers. Janaka says that the most important part for competitive swimmers is a proper swimming technique.
