Capital punishment should be a must for child rape

Another brutal case of rape and murder of a little boy named Sujith Nirmal was reported from the Chilaw district recently. In the post-mortem it was revealed that he was strangled to death after being sexually molested. Oh! what a cruel death it was! What pain would have he undergone during strangulation!
So would have been for the so many other raped and brutally murdered victims, specially of small children. In the recent past, after protests, criticism and condemnation by the civil society, the wheels of the law were moving fast for such cases and damnation given for a few convicts. But sadly not the capital punishment.
But capital punishment should be given at least for those who rape and kill, specially the children.
I think somebody of those who oppose capital punishment should become a victim of rape and get killed and only then they will realize the painful truth. Though I do not wish at all for such a thing to happen to anybody, my intense feelings towards such cases compel me to write it. The tears of the parents, brothers and sisters of the victim and the sadness of the people too is a contribution to it. All victims are from village areas and as such they easily fall prey to such killings. But as the children of those who oppose capital punishment are in Colombo they do not feel it. How can one be punished without sending him or her to the gallows for depriving the rights of living of another person?
We still remember Seya who was raped and brutally murdered. Her killer is in jail now until his death with no harm being done. By this letter I stress the President to implement capital punishment at least to the molester who murders his victim.
True, every living being has the right of living, yet for human consumption hundreds of cattle and lakhs of fowl are being killed daily. So should not a rapist who kills his victim, specially a child, be killed?
