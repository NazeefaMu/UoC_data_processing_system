Smooth solutions

Having dry skin is both a blessing and a curse. You rarely get pimples during your teens, make up stick on better to your face and you never look shiny. However dry skin does tend to show the passage of the years more with fine lines and wrinkles. Easing your dry skin is not just about what you put on it. It also depends on how you clean your skin, the air around you, and even your clothes.
Identifying dry skin
You may show the following symptoms if you possess dry skin:
* Almost invisible pores
* A dull, rough complexion
* Red patches
* Your skin will be less elastic
* More visible lines
Your skin can crack, peel, or become itchy, irritated, or inflamed if you have dry skin. If the skin is very dry, it can become rough and scaly, especially on the backs of your hands, arms, and legs.
Factors which causeskin to dry out
Dry skin may be caused or made worse by:
* Your genes
* Aging or hormonal changes
* Weather such as wind, sun, or cold
* Indoor heating
* Long, hot baths and showers
* Ingredients in soaps, cosmetics, or cleansers
* Medications
For many, dry skin is not a sign of a skin condition or disease, but is simply caused by harsh soaps, itchy clothing, misusing moisturiser, and long, hot showers. But the medications you take - and even medical conditions such as diabetes, psoriasis, hypothyroidism, and malnutrition - can also cause severe dry skin.
Medications that cause dry skin
Medications for medical conditions like high blood pressure (such as diuretics), cholesterol-lowering drugs, and acne (such as retinoids like Retin A and isotretinoin) may also dry out the skin.
Different types of dry skin
• Seborrheic dermatitis: This type involves a red, scaly, itchy rash on various areas of the body, particularly those areas that contain many oil glands. Seborrheic dermatitis can occur as scaling on the scalp, eyebrows and sides of the nose.
• Allergic contact dermatitis: This occurs when the skin comes into contact with a substance that causes an immune reaction, such as poison ivy. Allergic contact dermatitis of the hands often causes scaling on the fingers.
Atopic dermatitis: This is a long-lasting type of dermatitis that often runs in families. It may cause excessively dry, itchy skin too.
Athlete's foot: In many cases, athlete's foot shows up as dry flaking on the soles of the feet.
Areas of the body that are most prone to dry skin
The most common dry skin areas are the lower legs, hands and arms. While patches of dry, itchy skin can appear anywhere, it is most common on the arms, hands, lower legs and abdomen. Dry skin is often felt more than it is seen, but on some people it can be noticeable and embarrassing.
Importance of moisturizing
Regular use of lotion and moisturizer should be a part of any good skin care regimen. However some products are better than others. Choose a lotion with plenty of vitamins with an SPF of 15 to protect your skin during the day. Also use lotions that are oil free, non-comedogenic (won’t clog pores), allergy and dermatologist tested.
Some people often make the mistake of only applying moisturizer when dry skin occurs. You should apply moisturizer daily after washing, and before your face has time to dry completely. After cleansing, pat your face dry with a soft towel and apply your face lotion to your damp skin. Applying to damp skin is best because it is rehydrated and in the perfect state for sealing in that moisture. The same applies to the body as well.
Avoid or combat dry skin
Those having dry skin must choose a moisturizer that helps to restore moisture to the skin. It is better to use an oil-based moisturizer that contains moisturizing ingredients or petrolatum-based products. Such products will help keep your skin hydrated.
