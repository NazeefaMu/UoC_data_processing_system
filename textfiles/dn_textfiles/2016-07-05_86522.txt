Ananda and Nalanda – two production lines for many great cricketers

In the month of March we will eagerly await to see the two leading Buddhist schools in Sri Lanka lock horns at their Big Match. While the cricket stars from Ananda and Nalanda take the field to match their skills in the Battle of the Maroons their annual encounter, the stars of yesteryear will be there to go down memory lane and reminisce, this gathering in the ‘brothers tent’. It will give them the opportunity to talk about the good old days when they strolled down the ground to create many memorable moments for their fans of the game in both the colleges. These past cricketers will become teenagers in spirit although their exteriors have withered.
These two leading Buddhist institutions have not only produced the highest number of international cricket stars for Sri Lanka, they have also gifted us with excellent cricket administrators, elite cricket umpires, respected match referees, leading sports media personnel and very importantly talented commentators with brilliant oratorical skills and talented cricket writers who were instrumental in spreading cricket awareness to every nook and cranny in Sri Lanka.
It has now become the best in schools cricket encounters more importantly due to the quality of the by product. The fellow-feeling displayed are also worth a mention and one incident stands out in my memory.
I happened to be the captain of the Ananda team in 1966, in the Big match played at the Oval, Anura de Silva the brilliant Nalandian batsman was thrashing our bowlers to all corners of the Oval and he ultimately reached the dreaded figure of 99.
To deny him the single and the century, I got all the fielders on the off side closer and I stood at wide mid-off. Anura tried to lift the ball over the covers bowled by G.C. Perera and he dollied a catch to me which I took with glee. In next to no time the spectators were swarming around me and Anura like bees and they shouldered both of us.
There was no ill feeling amongst them and it showed that the game was played in good faith and the brotherhood between the two schools was clearly evident.
After the din had died down I went after Anura to congratulate him and he muttered something out of the dictionary to me, and I quickly retreated to the safety of my team mates. This was only short lived and Anura made amends by hugging me and apologizing to me in the pavilion.
In conclusion I would like to mention briefly about the proudest products of both schools; Arjuna Ranatunga who lifted the World Cup for Sri Lanka and who is now a cabinet minister, Bandula Warnapura, the first Sri Lankan Test captain who is now connected to the ACC on an important assignment, Roshan Mahanama, a holder of 3 world records connected to his batting, Marvan Atapattu who captained and coached the Sri Lankan team, Kumar Dharmasena who was a member of the Sri Lankan World Cup winning team under Arjuna Ranatunga and an Elite Test Umpire who umpired the 2015 World Cup final, Sidath Wettimuny who scored the first Test century for Sri Lanka and at the Lord’s cricket ground, a glorious 190. The above gentlemen are the legends so to say among many more outstanding players.
Note: Tilak de Silva will be writing to ‘Daily News’ every Tuesday. Tilak captained the Ananda College cricket team in 1966 and represented the Ceylon Schools cricket team captained by Anura Tennakoon in 1964 against the visiting Indian Schools team that included Eknath Solkar as a member. Tilak has watched and played cricket in England, Australia and Jamaica and has authored three books on cricket and written many articles on cricket to leading newspapers in Sri Lanka.
