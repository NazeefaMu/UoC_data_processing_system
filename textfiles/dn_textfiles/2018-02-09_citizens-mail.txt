Citizens' Mail

Unutilised Municipal toilets
There are municipal public toilets located on two-perch lands inside the line Attay watta in Maligakanda road, Colombo 10, which is no more in use with the water supply being disconnected.
This place has become an eyesore with garbage strewn inside and outside. This is to suggest that Municipality should demolish these toilets immediately and make use of this space to put up a reading room/library for the use of the students residing in this garden. Or else plant trees and flowers to make garden more pleasing to the eye.
The Municipality can also look into other options to make use of this space such as to put a mini-children’s park or some other purpose which will bring benefits to the residents of the above garden.
