Our objective is to win the Asia Cup – U19 coach Tillakaratne

The Sri Lanka under 19 cricket team led by Nipun Dananjaya of Joseph Vaz left for Bangladesh yesterday evening to compete in the Under 19 Asia Cup.
The tournament will be played from September 29 to October 7 and it will feature eight teams. Sri Lanka will compete in a tough group - Group B with host Bangladesh whom they meet in their first match on Saturday, Hong Kong and Pakistan.
Group A consists of Afghanistan (the defending champions), India, Nepal and UAE. Most of the squad remains unchanged from the last test and one-day international series Sri Lanka featured in against U-19 World Cup champions India.
The team is under the watchful eyes of head coach Hashan Tillakaratne, a former Sri Lanka cricketer. Tillakaratne said prior to the teams’ departure that they have a well balanced side with a very good spin attack and a batting line up that is also capable of making runs.
“We have to rise to the challenge in each game. Our main objective is to win the Asia Cup,” Tillakaratne said.
