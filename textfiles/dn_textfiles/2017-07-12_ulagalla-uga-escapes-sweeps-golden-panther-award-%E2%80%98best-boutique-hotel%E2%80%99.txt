Ulagalla by Uga Escapes sweeps Golden Panther Award for ‘Best Boutique Hotel’ in Germany

Ulagalla, one of Uga Escapes’ renowned boutique properties, snatched the Golden Panther Award for ‘Best Boutique Hotel’ 2017 at an awards ceremony held in Germany.
Located within Sri Lanka’s famed Cultural Triangle, Ulagalla dates back 150 years, where it first originated as a chieftain’s mansion. Today, the property is a spectacular luxury hotel, known not only for its superiority, but also its timeless character and personality. With 20 exceedingly private, ecologically-built villas that have been artfully positioned throughout 58 acres of sprawling land, Ulagalla stands out for blending in with its lush surroundings.
The main feature is without a doubt the solar farm, responsible for generating over half of the property’s energy requirements. And as the hotel is deeply committed to sustainable business practices, this is just one part of its expansive, environmentally-friendly ethos. They also have their own organic garden and rice paddy fields.
Ulagalla is conveniently situated in close proximity to some of the country’s most significant tourist attractions, such as the ancient kingdoms of Anuradhapura and Polonnaruwa, and Sigiriya Rock. Complete with an underground spa that effortlessly rivals others of its kind, it is easy to see why the hotel is a premier choice amongst travellers, bagging the 2016 Tripadvisor Certificate of Excellence and 2017 Tripadvisor Travellers’ Choice award as well. Ulagalla’s indulgent private plunge pools, sun decks and sumptuous king-sized four poster beds coupled with impeccable service, are further proof of its exceptional facilities, which are also qualifying traits for such a title as ‘Best Boutique Hotel.’
The Golden Panther Award is a prestigious recognition in the world of hospitality, and aims to recognise, and reward outstanding luxury hotels worldwide for their services. The ceremony was an intimate affair with sophistication and poise infused into every element of the proceedings.
Ulagalla is proud to have been appreciated for its efforts, and looks forward to making further waves within the industry.
