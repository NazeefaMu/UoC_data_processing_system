New petrol stocks distributed around SL

Distribution of petrol stocks to sheds around the country started last evening as the oil tanker Neverska Lady arrived at Colombo Port on Wednesday (8) night.
Ministry of Petroleum Resource Development Secretary Upali Marasinghe speaking to Daily News said, the tests conducted on the oil shipment were clear and that the distribution network would be strengthened by yesterday evening.
He added that the stocks from Neverska would be sufficient to supply fuel across the country for the next 12 days and thereafter they expected the usual shipments to be delivered to the island.
Another oil tanker is expected to arrive on November 12 and thereafter, the next scheduled shipment would be on November 17.
