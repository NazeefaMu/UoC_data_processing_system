Book Review: Nostalgic look at a faraway city

Diaspora Theory with its various features has influenced the literature of every language of the world. This literature is widely known as Expatriate or Diasporic Literature. It would be proper to examine features and aspects of such literature in which Sri Lankan writing in English not only contributed greatly but also received international recognition and admiration in the past few years.
Diasporic Literature is an umbrella term that includes in it all those literary works written by the authors outside their native country, but these works are associated with native culture and background. In this wide context, all those writers can be regarded as diasporic writers, who write outside their country but remained related to their homeland through their works. Diasporic literature has its roots in the sense of loss and alienation, which emerged as a result of migration and expatriation.
Generally, diasporic literature deals with alienation, displacement, existential rootlessness, nostalgia, the quest for identity. It also addresses issues related to amalgamation or disintegration of cultures. It reflects the immigrant experience that comes out of the immigrant settlement.
The title of the second book by Charlotte Perera, It’s the Same Moon, leads us to basic elements of diasporic literature, though it has not been essentially written by a diasporic author. Perera does not belong to the school of diasporic literature. But she bridges the diaspora community and their relatives. A major issue that most expatriates may feel when they are out of their home country is being marginalised – though this cannot be generalised. They feel the gravity of marginalisation when they return to their motherland where they feel more ‘belonged’.
Writing comes naturally to Perera. She does not seem to struggle with the art like most Sri Lankan English writers. Writing in English is a struggle for most Sri Lankan authors not exactly because of a fault of their own. The language does not have grounds to grow up. Because English is not a language of link, the language is lagging behind. Compared to the Sinhalese literature, both English and Tamil literature are at a disadvantage. Thankfully, the phenomenon is getting better than it used to be. All the same, the growth is not fast-paced.
It is the writing style that makes this book a frontrunner. The story unfolds through the eyes of an unseen protagonist. Though the book is about a certain remote area of Sri Lanka, the author brings in complex topics with ease into the storyline. Just as it should be, since humans are capable of thoughtful participation in everyday complexities, in their homes or other environments.
One salient feature of Perera’s novel is that it is proof-read well, unlike most English novels published in the country. Although the language at times may seem a tad formal, Perera is quite composed in her lyrical style of writing. She deserves kudos, for not many authors are blessed with such a talent.
Perera’s is one of those books you read when you're looking for something to challenge your brain a little bit and give you a break from story-driven novels. Something that as it progresses tends to wax philosophical while losing all semblance of following a structure and being character driven. Something that makes you feel a little smarter for a moment before making you wish there was something a little bit deeper there.
Nostalgia takes place in a place where mankind has seemingly discovered immortality. As humans live longer and longer, they take on more and more mental baggage. Rather than live for decades with painful memories, humans have parts of their minds erased and replaced with fictional, more pleasant histories.
Certain passages may not be much of a warm read. If we hasten to call this nostalgic novel, then it could be less hardcore than most of what we come across in the western sphere from this genre. It is close enough to nostalgia that you could relate to it, absorb its questions and ponder it still after you close the covers.
This could be considered more as a non-autobiographical memoir. The writer’s thoughts on faith (in the general more than religious sense) emerge as the antithesis to a stern sense of nostalgia. Perhaps this goes a long way to explain the strife in today's world.
Life at Dullawa Walawwa or The Mansion was changing slowly. Harin baby was five years old and he was admitted to a private English school. Madhuri’s ayah always went up and down with the child in a car. Chathura was very fond of the child who always reminded him of his beloved friend Haritha. The child too adored Chathura Mama, because he didn’t feel the absence of a father as Chathura did everything to look after the boy. Madhuri was still weeping for her husband. What she couldn’t bear was the uncertainty.
It’s the Same Moon is an evocative title; Sri Lanka, its remote areas and somewhere distant as London and many other faraway cities, they all come together as a tapestry, as Perera describes Anuradhapura. The book brings up the same evocative sense mixed with a fair bit of nostalgia.
Storytelling is an art that makes the readers think and respect their own intellect. Charlotte Perera succeeds in this aspect. The book happily mixes travel writing with storytelling.
Excellent writing, especially because of its lyrical rendering, but in certain chapters, the story misses the magic spirit that makes speculative fiction sparkle.
