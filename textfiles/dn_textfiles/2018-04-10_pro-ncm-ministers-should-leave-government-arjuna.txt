Pro-NCM ministers should leave government: Arjuna

Petroleum Resources Development Minister Arjuna Ranatunga said that if he had voted in favour of the No-Confidence Motion (NCM), he would have not remained in the government, even if the President requested him to.
He was responding to a query that was raised by a journalist at the Welagedara Stadium in Kurunegala, recently.
He further said, “The Joint Opposition brought up the NCM and it was defeated. I would not have had any moral ground to remain in the government as a minister, if I had voted in favour of it; I would have resigned before receiving a response from President Maithripala Sirisena or Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe. The President and the Prime Minister will take the necessary decisions regarding this matter in the near future. I will raise my voice as well, if the need arises.”“Certain Sri Lanka Freedom Party ministers voted in favour of the NCM under the assumption that it would weaken the government, but the result was the opposite. The President and the Prime Minister will contribute for the development of the country. As Politicians, we should follow the proper procedures without taking the law into our own hands,” Minister Ranatunga added.
He said the upcoming provincial election would be held at a proper time and that the government would be able to secure a win.
