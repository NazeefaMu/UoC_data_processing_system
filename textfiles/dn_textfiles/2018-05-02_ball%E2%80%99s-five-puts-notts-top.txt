Ball’s five-for puts Notts on top

LONDON, Monday - Nottinghamshire beat Worcestershire by an innings and 41 runs to go top of the English County Championship Division One table on Monday.
Notts forced victory inside five sessions of playing time after the first two days were lost to rain.
A swift 38 from England bowler Stuart Broad helped Notts to 300-9 declared, giving the visitors a lead of 190 and a minimum of 80 overs to force a result.
Pace bowler Jake Ball boosted his England Test hopes with 5-59 as Worcestershire were bowled out for 149. For Worcestershire, who suffered a third straight defeat, only three batsmen, including top-scorer Tom Fell (37), faced more than 30 balls in the innings, which lasted just 38.2 overs.
Ball removed opener Brett D'Oliveira with the second ball of the hosts' second innings and they lost three wickets in the 10 overs before lunch, before slipping to a third consecutive Championship defeat in the afternoon session.
England opener Mark Stoneman again failed to fully press his case for Test selection in Surrey's Division One draw with Lancashire at Old Trafford.
Stoneman made a patient 29, his highest score in four Championship innings this season, before he was caught behind down the leg side off Tom Bailey.
Surrey, following on 204 runs behind after being bowled out for 235 on the final morning, ended on 199-6. Paceman Bailey took 4-13 in 19 overs for an impressive match haul of 8-67.
Jack Leaning's 68 could not prevent Somerset from claiming their second win of the Championship campaign as they beat Yorkshire by 118 runs in Taunton.
Chasing a target of 321, with nine wickets left, Yorkshire lost Cheteshwar Pujara to the day's first ball.
Adam Lyth (34) and skipper Gary Ballance (19) soon followed as the visitors slumped to 81-4.
Leaning hit eight fours and he was last to go as they were all out for 202, with Craig Overton taking 3-41.
Victory put Somerset second in the table behind Notts, and it is the first time since 1993 that they have started their Championship campaign with two wins.
Hampshire and Essex vied for bonus points as their weather-affected match at the Ageas Bowl ended in a draw.
Resuming on 241-4, Liam Dawson (34 not out) and Kyle Abbott (43) helped Hampshire secure a fourth batting bonus point as they declared on 351-7.
Brad Wheal (2-63) helped reduce Essex to 61-3 in reply before Alastair Cook (84) anchored the visitors' recovery.
Ravi Bopara (84 not out) helped guide the defending champions to 300-6 with help from James Foster (46).
Hampshire, who were denied a third bowling point, move up to third in the table while Essex remain unbeaten at the start of their title defence and leapfrog Yorkshire to go fourth.
Sussex and Gloucestershire were thwarted in their respective bids for a Division Two victory as rain prevented any play on the final day at Hove.
The visitors were due to resume on 108-6, chasing 167 to win. But a tense conclusion never materialised as the weather intervened and play was called off for the day. Both sides took eight points from the match, leaving both on 29 points after three Division Two games.
