New UPFA General Secretary wants to build rapport with all parties

 
Newly appointed UPFA General Secretary Mahinda Amaraweera said he would initially build a cordial rapport with all parties under the UPFA banner aiming to create a broader alliance.
He said so while participating in the first media briefing after being appointed the UPFA General Secretary at the Information Department yesterday.
"My initial aim is to strengthen the UPFA. Discussions will be held mainly with parties which are in the UPFA aiming to create a cordial rapport with each party. Attention will be drawn towards attracting other parties which are currently not with the UPFA to the UPFA. As the final outcome, a broader alliance will be created under the leadership of President Maithripala Sirisena," he said.
Questioned whether he was capable of avoiding a probable split in the UPFA, Amaraweera said SLFP members will never work towards splitting the UPFA.
They have very clearly understood that the UNP will benefit if the party is split, he said.
He added that the good governance government is neither a SLFP nor UNP government.
"Under this government, security forces personnel are protected. Accordingly no one is talking about electric chairs, international military courts and Geneva proposals, unlike during the previous regime," Amaraweera said.
Speaking on development projects which are at a standstill, he said many of the proposed development and infrastructure development projects will commence by next month.
It has been planned to start all key projects by next month, Amaraweera said.
He said there should be discipline in the SLFP and the UPFA. Minister Amaraweera said that disciplinary measures will probably be taken only after discussions at the Central Committee of the SLFP against those who violate party discipline.
He said any party can join the UPFA after accepting the rules of the UPFA adding that the National Government agreement is valid until December 2017.
Answering a question about his stance on the FCID, Amaraweera said that inter party discussions are being held in this regard whether the FCID is needed further.
Attention will be drawn on the conduct of these bodies. Accordingly, it is considered whether any investigations of these institutes are being conducted to fulfill personnel or political agendas or aiming at personal harassment, he said.
