Berlin Sri Lanka Embassy offers 28 Buddha statues

The Embassy of Sri Lanka in Berlin offered 28 Buddha statues to the Theravada Buddhist Temple in Frohnau, Berlin on June 26.
The event marked the first programme to be conducted by the Embassy to celebrate the 65th Anniversary of Sri Lanka-German diplomatic relations.
Sri Lanka’s Ambassador to Germany Eng. Karunasena Hettiarachchi initiated the programme and was assisted by the members of the ‘Suwatha Kawaya of Independence Square, Colombo 7’, coordinated by Mahinda Bandara and Sudath Tennakoon. The Foreign Affairs Ministry together with the Buddha Sasana Ministry and the Sri Lanka Customs assisted the mission. The handing over ceremony was held at the Embassy along with the representatives of the Sri Lanka Associations in Berlin and the Embassy staff. The resident monk of the Frohnau Buddhist Temple, Ven. Mahagama Suvineetha Thera, conducted the religious observances and blessed those who initiated and assisted the task.
On Sunday, July 1, a special ceremony will be held to commemorate Poson at the Frohnau Buddhist Temple together with a special Atawisi Buddha Pooja to bless the President and people of Sri Lanka and the participants from Germany. Sri Lankans living in Berlin and the German Buddhist community expressed deep gratitude for the offering which will also contribute to Buddhism in Germany. This gesture will promote the cordial relations between Sri Lanka and Germany.
