Five corruption cases against Johnston:
Order on preliminary objections fixed for Jan. 18

Colombo Chief Magistrate Lal Ranasinghe Bandara yesterday fixed for January 18 to deliver its order in respect of preliminary objections raised by former Minister Johnston Fernando and two others regarding five corruption cases.
The Bribery Commission had filed five corruption cases against former Minister Johnston Fernando and two others for allegedly causing Rs. 40 million loss to the government by employing 153 employees of the Cooperative Wholesale Establishment (CWE) for election work during 2010 to 2014.
The Defence had filed preliminary objections against the Bribery Commission’s decision to file an amended charge sheet.
Former Cooperative and Internal Trade Minister Johnston Fernando, former CWE (Lak Sathosa) Chairman Eraj Fernando and former Minister’s Private Secretary Raj Mohideen Mohammad Sakeer were present before Colombo Additional Magistrate Buddhika Sri Ragala.
The Director General of the Commission to Investigate Allegations of Bribery or Corruption filed these corruption cases against three accused under Section 70 of the Bribery Act on three charges.
The Bribery Commission alleged that the first accused Johnston Fernando had unlawfully employed 153 employees for election work, while he was serving as the Minister of Cooperative and Internal Trade.
Defence Counsel Niroshan Siriwardena appeared for the accused. Counsel Ganga Heiyanthuduwa appeared for the Bribery Commission.
