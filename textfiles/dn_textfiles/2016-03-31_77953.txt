It is also expected to submit a petition with one million signatures to force the government to hold Local Government Elections, he said.
Prof Peiris also said that there are no legal barriers to postpone the election and added that there is only a political purpose behind the postponement of the election. He claimed that the government knows that it will be defeated if it holds the election on time due to the crisis situation currently experienced by the government.
Commenting on the government's attempt to attract foreign investors, Prof. Peiris said that only the insane will invest with the crisis relating to economy, electricity and basic other requirements which are needed for investments. UPFA Matara District MP Mahinda Yapa Abeywardane said the government is the weakest government formed in the recent times in Sri Lanka.
The government has failed to fulfilled the basic needs of the people. People who depend on tea and rubber have to commit suicide since the government has failed to fulfill their requirements, he said. UPFA Gampaha District MP Sisira Jayakody urged the police to arrest the people who were involved in the demolition of walking track in Wattala under the Public Property Act following a proper investigation, since they have damaged public property.
