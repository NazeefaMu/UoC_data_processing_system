Rajarata tanks dry up

The North Central Water Supply and Drainage Board, Irrigation Department and the Anuradhapura Government Agent are trying their best to resolve drinking water issue in Anuradhapura.
Irrigation, Water Resources and Disaster Management Minister Duminda Dissanayake visited the Nuwarawewa tank area and inspect the situation.
The Anuradhapura District Irrigation Director, Engineer Prasanna Silva told the Minister that water level of the Nuwarawewa has receded and it contains only 5.1 feet of water at present.
Major tanks in Anuradhapura are drying up and farmers and residents do not have enough irrigational and drinking water. Minister Dissanayake said 100 farm wells will be dug to resolve the issue to some extent. About 45.000 people live in Rambewa, Palugaswewa, Nuwaragam Palatha Central, Kebithigollewa, Thirappane, Mahavilachchiya, Padaviya and Nochchiyagama. Mahaweli Water will be supplied to Thisawewa, Nuwarawewa and Thuruwila.
The Anuradhapura District Irrigation Engineer said the Mahaweli Water Management Committee supplies Mahaweli water to several tanks but more water should be released to Nuwarawewa, Thuruwila and Thisawewa to resolve the issue.
