Warrant issued against MP Weerakumara Dissanayake

 
The Colombo Chief Magistrate issued a warrant against National Freedom Front (NFF) Parliamentarian Weerakumara Dissanayake for failing to appear before court over a case filed by Cinnamon Garden Police, today.
Cinnamon Garden Police is expecting to file charge sheets against National Freedom Front (NFF) leader and Parliamentarian Wimal Weerawansa and six other party activists for allegedly providing leadership to a protest which blocks the main roads at Bauddhaloka Mawatha, causing disturbance to the people and the normal flow of traffic.  
 However, when the case came up before Chief Magistrate Lal Ranasinghe Bandara, the suspect Weerakumara Dissanayake was not present in court.
 On February 6, 2016, the NFF staged a protest march against the visit of United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights Zeid Ra'ad Al Hussein. 
 Seven suspects NFF leader and Colombo District MP Wimal Weerawansa, Jayantha Samaraweera, Weerakumara Dissanayake, Piyasiri Wijenayake, Roger Seneviratne, Mohammed Muzammil and Don Lusian are currently out on bail.  
 Police had informed Court that the suspects who organized the procession had failed to obtain the prior permission from Police to organise the march.
They further alleged that the organizers had also used loudspeakers without a valid license.
The Police further submitted to Court that the suspects steered the protest which blocks the main road at Bauddhaloka Mawatha towards Havelock Town, causing disturbance to commuters and the normal flow of traffic. 
Further Magisterial inquiry into the matter was postponed to December 11.
