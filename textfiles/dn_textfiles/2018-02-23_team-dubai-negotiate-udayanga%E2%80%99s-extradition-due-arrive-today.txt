Team to Dubai to negotiate Udayanga’s extradition due to arrive today

The team that left the country on Tuesday to negotiate with the Dubai authorities regarding the extradition of the former Sri Lanka Ambassador to Russia, Udayanga Weeratunga is expected to return to the country today (23).
However, an FCID source told the Daily News yesterday that it was still uncertain whether Weeratunga would be brought back to the country by this team today.
When contacted, the Foreign Ministry Spokesperson Maheshini Colonne said no one from the Foreign Ministry had been on this team that left for Dubai last Tuesday and she had not received any information regarding Weeratunge’s arrest so far.
The team comprising members of the Attorney General’s Department and the FCID had left for Dubai to make submissions to the courts there in order to have the former Sri Lankan Ambassador to Russia Udayanga Weeratunga, extradited to Sri Lanka. Additional Solicitor General Yasantha Kodagoda and FCID Director P.K.D. Priyantha had left the country armed with a red warrant for Weeratunga’s arrest.
Weeratunga was detained in Dubai on February 4, but his extradition was not possible due to diplomatic issues and the absence of an extradition agreement between the two countries.
