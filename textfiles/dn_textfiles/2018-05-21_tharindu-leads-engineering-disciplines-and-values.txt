Tharindu leads with engineering disciplines and values

Meeting point
Tharindu Atapattu is a dynamic young CEO at 39 years of age. Leading Mc Shaw Automotive Limited he is a practical, pragmatic CEO who is always accessible to his staff at every level. He believes in leading a humble life with a focus on transforming and empowering others. When he was in school, he excelled in studies and also won a gold medal (world prize) for mathematics.
Having studied at Richmond College, Galle, Tharindu entered the University of Moratuwa, where he obtained an engineering degree with a first class. He completed an MBA at the University of Colombo and got qualified as a Certified Management Accountant (Australia) and a Certified Global Business Analyst (Australia). Currently he is reading for his PhD in Marketing.
Last week, when we met him at his office, we noticed he had opened up the blinds to let the sunlight filter in, not using electricity, as he is deeply concerned about nature and sustainability. Excerpts from the conversation:
 
Q: Can you tell us the story of your successes, challenges, and major responsibilities? 
A: Success: - My motto is ‘Passionate for the Purpose of Doing Things’. If there is any success in my life, it is simply because of the passion I have on what I’m doing than anything else. Knowledge and experience comes next. I’m learning something new on a daily basis simply because of that passion.
Challenges: -The main challenge that I see in the market is the ‘passion deficiency’. Lot of people are engaged in an ‘activity’ than bringing their total passion and focus in to what they are doing. As a result, we see situational bottlenecks which need to be corrected then and there before a system collapses. It needs a lot of time; hence the patience. It is a consistent process.
Responsibilities:-I believe it is a responsibility of every manager (not only at the CEO level) to bring the ‘whole’ person in to what they are doing and help them to inculcate passion. Once the passion is built within all the members, business will take off as every cell of the business is oriented toward the desired state of success.
 
Q: Why does Mobil/lubricant oil industry excite you so much? 
 
A: Scientifically and practically Mobil is one of the best performing lubricant manufacturers in the world. I went in to details of the properties of Mobil lubricants and realized that it is the best in Sri Lanka. Therefore, we have to say only the truth to promote it among those who are still not using it. No need to articulate stories to market it. It matches with my engineering discipline and values very well. Therefore, it excites me every moment.
 
Q: How would you characterize your management style? 
 
A: I believe in working with people and working for people. I’m always open for comments and critics from all levels. I scrutinize every one’s opinion with my own experience and knowledge to articulate the best decision for my company and people. I train people a lot to take them out of their silos to challenge me, as every challenge sharpens my experience and knowledge. It is absolutely an open culture than an ‘authoritative black box’.
 
Q: What challenges are you facing in the business right now? 
A: Consumers are cluttered with a lot of noises and it is very difficult to convince them on what is good what is better and what is best.
 
Q: How does your professionalism contribute to a better society? 
A: I’m working with all members of my staff very closely and regularly. I’m introducing new ways of performing routines to save time. Saving time on routines increases the quality time for real complex tasks and hence the accuracy. Finally, it helps people to achieve their personal and company objectives more effectively. Likewise, I expect them to practice it with the next level, and the cycle continues. It induces creativity on people to deliver good results, automatically towards a better society. Its chain effect as ‘People who feel good about themselves produce good results’.
In general, whenever I interact with fresh professionals even at interview level, I take about five minutes to explain what he or she must do differently to create competitive edge to succeed in their own career.
Q: What book do you think everyone on the team should read? 
A: Beyond reading, I would recommend people to listen to empowering speeches of Simon Sinek, Sean Buranahiran and Gaur Gopal to balance their life with all the necessary ingredients such as determination, perseverance, persistence and resilience towards happiness. I feel happiness is a journey not a destination. It is people who make a difference in your life.
 
Q: How do you like to see Sri Lanka in 2020? 
 
A: Today Sri Lanka is a $ 87 billion economy and Singapore is $ 300 billion and India is $ 2,200 billion but in 1970, Sri Lanka was 2.5 billion, Singapore was $ 2 billion and India was $ 60 billion. If you see Malaysia, the Philippines or Vietnam, very nation has grown exponentially. Sri Lanka is having the lowest economic growth for the last 40-45 years.
By looking at those numbers everybody knows what has gone wrong with Sri Lanka. We cannot expect any miracle to happen by 2020.
I would like to see an initiative which will motivate emancipated professionals to come on the decision making seats like Singapore to lead every sector of the economy towards prosperity without any political colours.
 
Q: What is the best lesson you have learned so far from one single person? 
 
A: Do things only what you can explain to somebody else- from the Buddha.
 
Q: What is your formula of managing people and making a result-oriented team? 
A: It’s based on restorative justice where you train people than punishing them under punitive justice. I am a people oriented person. Today’s scars are tomorrow’s trophies. My manthra includes, convincing team for an ambitious goal, tell team what to do next, do it with the team – on the job training, ownership - allow them to do it on their own, monitor results not the method and refine and redefine the process towards perfection.
 
Q: As a young CEO what do you like to share with the younger generation as far as their professions are concerned? 
A: As Napoleon Hill said, whatever the mind of man can conceive and believe, it can be achieved. So if your goal is genuine, nature supports you to achieve it. And Abdul Kalam has said, ‘Have dreams which will not allow you to sleep’. If you work to establish your brand right everything else will align and work for your brand identity than anything else.
 
Q: What should be the next step of your career? 
A: Be a well-established business turnaround and re-engineering professional
 
Q: Tell us about your family? 
 
A: My wife is working for the Ministry of Finance as an Assistant Director and she is a product of the University of Peradeniya. We have one son. My parents are retired government servants and products of the University of Colombo.
 
Q: Anythingelse you liketo share? 
 
A: Every good leader needs to practice ten “I”s of leadership to be a real leader, who others will follow and respect. They are, Imagining– Conceptualizing, Intelligent– Realizing the reality, Innovating– Out of the box approach, Initiating -Moving First, Introducing– Creating the awareness, elaborative, Inspiring– Making the team cheerful, Involving– Contributing ongoing work as a team member, Instructing– Directing and redirecting members towards the goal, Influencing -Pushing the team to the goal when necessary and Integrity -Ethical approach in all aspects.
