Micro-sculptures inspired by Game of Thrones

A talented sculptor has unveiled microscopic works carved out of lead and inspired by Game of Thrones .
Salavat Fidai’s creations are so small that he uses a microscope to make them and his audience are issued with magnifying glasses to study them.
Fidai is showing off 30 of his micro-sculptures in an exhibition in Singapore in southeast Asia.
They include minuscule, but fantastically detailed, representations of Games of Thrones icons and characters. They include the Iron Throne, Daenerys Targaryen’s dragons, the three-eyed raven, Jon Snow’s sword Longclaw and Cersei Lannisters’s crown.
Also featured are the Titan of Braavos fortress, a white walker, a weirwood tree, the Hand of the King’s pin, the Night King and the Oathkeeper sword given by Jaime Lannister to Brienne of Tarth.
Fidai, from the city of Ufa in south-central Russia’s Republic of Bashkortostan region, also recreated the sigils (coats of arms) of the houses of Stark, GreyJoy, Lannister, Baratheon and Targaryen.
All the tiny pencil sculptures are displayed individually, with visitors able to use their magnifying glasses to observe them from all angles.
The exhibition was sponsored by Game Of Thrones producers HBO who are using it to publicise the upcoming seventh season of the show.
Visitors at the K+ Curatorial Space in Singapore’s Scotts Square can marvel at the intricate artwork for free until June 24.
Netizen ‘Slava Borisova’ commented: “This man is darn talented”, and ‘Valentin Rusivhevich’ added: “Nicely done, man. Good luck with your career.”
In the future, Fidai plans to finish his Game of Thrones collection by carving out the coat of arms of the houses of Martell, Tyrell, Arryn, Mormont, Clegane and Tully. He has previously exhibited his work in England, Germany, the UAE and twice in the USA. Mirror
