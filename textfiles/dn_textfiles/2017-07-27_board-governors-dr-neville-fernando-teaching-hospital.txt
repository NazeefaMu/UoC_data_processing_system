Board of governors for Dr. Neville Fernando Teaching Hospital

The Cabinet approved the proposal to appoint a board of governors to maintain the services of the Dr. Neville Fernando Teaching Hospital, Malabe.
Former Health Services Director General Dr. U.A. Ajith Mendis has been appointed as the Chairman of the board of governors, Health and Indigenous Medicine Minister Rajitha Senaratne said.
Addressing the Cabinet briefing yesterday, Minister Senartne said those who are protesting against the Dr. Neville Fernando Hospital are the ones who are unable to stomach the fact that a hospital worth Rs. 3.5 billion was donated to the government.
Responding to a question about the GMOA's allegations that the hospital would be returned to Dr. Fernando in 10 years, Minister Senaratne said the decisions are taken by the Government.
