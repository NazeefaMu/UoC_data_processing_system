Swaraj meets Finance Minister Mangala Samaraweera

External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj on Saturday met Sri Lankan Finance Minister Mangala Samaraweera and discussed issues of development cooperation between the two countries, MEA Spokesperson Raveesh tweeted.
Sri Lanka is a major recipient of development credit given by India with total commitment of around USD 2.63 billion, including USD 458 million as grants.
Under a line of credit of USD 167.4 million, the tsunami-damaged Colombo-Matara rail link was repaired and upgraded.
Another line of credit of USD 800 million for track laying and supply of rolling stock to construct railway lines in northern Sri Lanka is already operational.
In October 2014, the Pallai-Jaffna reconstructed railway track and signal system was inaugurated reconnecting Jaffna to Colombo by rail.- PTI.
