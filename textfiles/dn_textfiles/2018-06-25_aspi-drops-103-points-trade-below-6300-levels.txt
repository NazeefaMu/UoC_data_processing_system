Point of view
The ASPI extended its losing streak for the 5th consecutive week to push past the key psychological mark of 6,300 points to end at 6,228.15. The main share index recorded the highest weekly loss for the year during the week as ASPI lost 103 points (1.63%) as Heavy weight JKH dropped 4.0% to end at Rs.150. The YTD loss on the Benchmark price Index by end-week was 2.2%, highlighting the ~313 point (4.8%) dip since late April when the ASPI began to drop.
Notably, ASPI had ended a week in a positive note only once since late April. More Liquid S&P20 SL index also dropped 99 points (2.80%) during the week and consequently YTD loss on the index widened further to 3.9%.
Activity levels in the market improved during the week as Turnover increased 48% to Rs.3.0Bn.
Activity levels during this week were mainly driven by the HNIs and Local institutional investors as crossings accounted for 44% of the week’s Turnover.
JKH accounted for ~50% of the crossings while Hemas & Lanka Walltiles accounted for 31% and 11% respectively. The activity helped push average turnover value to Rs.0.6Bn cf. Rs.0.5Bn last week.
Foreign investors continued to withdraw funds from Sri Lankan equities during the week however, at a slower pace as net foreign outflows during this week amounted to Rs.161Mn cf. Rs.219Mn last week. Despite this week’s foreign equity sell-off, foreign appetite for relatively undervalued Sri Lankan equities has remained positive thus far in Q2’18 with total net inflows in Q2’18 totaling to ~Rs1.5Bn (cf. outflow of Rs.2.6Bn in Q1’18).
Markets in the week ahead are likely to look for cues from further economic and political developments.
1Q’18 GDP growth falls to 3.2% Y-o-Y
GDP growth in the 1st quarter of 2018 fell to 3.2% Y-o-Y (cf. 3.8% Y-o-Y in Q1’17 and 3.5% in 4Q’18) due to a slowdown in the growth of the Industrial Sector despite recovery of the Agricultural sector and marginal improvement of Service Sector during the period.
Over this quarter, the Agricultural sector which declined consecutively over several quarters till 3Q’17 continued the growth momentum created in 4Q’17.
Agricultural sector recorded the highest growth among all sectors (4.8% Y-o-Y) as ‘Growing of Rice’ recovered with a notable 56.6% Y-o-Y growth over the period (cf. 49.6% decline last year due to adverse weather conditions).
Meanwhile ‘Growing of Cereals’, ‘Growing of Vegetables’, ‘Growing of Tea’ recorded 40.2%, 22.3%, and 10.6% respectively.
Service sector activities which account for ~57% of overall GDP meanwhile improved marginally from 4.3% Y-o-Y in 1Q’17 to 4.4% Y-o-Y in Q1’18.
Growth in the sector was driven by the ‘Financial service activities’, ‘Wholesale and retail trade’, ‘Telecommunication’, ‘Other personal service activities’, and ‘Real estate activities, including ‘Ownership of dwelling’.

The second largest contributor, the Industrial sector, slowed down in 1Q’18 (0.9% Y-o-Y growth cf. 3.7% in 1Q’17) as ‘Manufacture of coke and refined petroleum products’ contracted 38.8% Y-o-Y whilst the Construction sector (7.4% of GDP) declined 4.9% Y-o-Y.
The CBSL projects GDP growth to recover in 2018 to 5.0% on the back of modest recovery in Agriculture sector and continued positive momentum in Services and Industrial sectors.
Earlier in April’18, CBSL also eased policy rates by 25bps and held it unchanged in its 3rd Monetary Policy Review in May’18.
