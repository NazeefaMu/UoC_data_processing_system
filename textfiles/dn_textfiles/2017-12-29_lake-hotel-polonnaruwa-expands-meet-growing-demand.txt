Lake Hotel Polonnaruwa expands to meet growing demand

The Lake Hotel Polonnaruwa, built at the end of the Parakrama Samudraya, will be expanding their facilities to meet the growing demands of both local and foreign guests due to rapid development taking place in Polonnaruwa.
Deputy General Manger Operations, Nihal Muhandiram, GFH Management Co. Pvt. Ltd, said that they first started with the expansion of their restaurant adding more covers. “This would be completed by mid 2018.”
In addition, the management is also looking at introducing a spa to add more facilities to the hotel.
Recalling the history, he said that the hotel was built in the 1960s and was earlier known as Hotel Seruwa and was then given to the Galle Face Hotels Group.
Since then, the 40 air-conditioned deluxe rooms with all modern amenities have undergone extensive renovation that respects both the unique location and historical significance in elegant simplicity, style and comfort.
There are 18 bedrooms on the ground floor that open out to the front lawn which is located in front of the Parakrama Samudraya, while 22 rooms are located on the first floor offering beautiful views across the lake and beyond. “We have made the upstair rooms bigger by taking space from the balconies,” he said.
Spread over three acres of landscaped garden, two swimming pools and large deck area, the hotel is a ten-minute walk to the beautiful Lake House, the second hotel of the group.
Muhandiram, an industry veteran having been in the industry for over 22 years and serving in the Maldives for two decades, said that one of the main plus points to the hotel is its location. “You can see wild elephants 80% of the year and the scenery is much praised by the guest comments. Our boat tours and other excursions too are a major draw to the hotel.”
He said that their main market is foreigners (80%) and they maintain around 70% of occupancy year on year.
Meanwhile, Senior Vice President at Galle Face Hotel Management Co. Ltd and Director of the The Gardiner Foundation (GF) of Sri Lanka, Chandra Mohotti said that as a commitment for this project they will allocate six rooms from the hotel for researchers who come to visit the project.(ss)
