Pimp My TukTuk Charity Ride benefits charities

The 2017 Pimp My TukTuk Charity Ride which combines tourism with charity ended in Colombo last Friday with 54 riders in 27 tuktuks travelling the length and breadth of Sri Lanka within eight days.
Organised by the Pimp My TukTuk Team, Singapore, in partnership with the Foundation of Goodness in Sri Lanka, funds raised by this endeavour will be donated to selected charitable and developmental projects under the stewardship of the Foundation of Goodness in Sri Lanka, as well as to ‘Food from the Heart’, Singapore, Kushil Gunasekera, Founderhief Trustee of Foundation of Goodness told the media during a press briefing in Colombo on Friday.
According to Gunasekera, the official tour commenced from Colombo and travelled across the country from Sigiriya and Mihintale to Trincomalee, before travelling down the east coast to Batticaloa and Arugam Bay, heading inwards across Monaragala before returning to the southern coast and proceeding via Unawatuna to Colombo (with a special stop at the Foundation of Goodness MCC Centre of Excellence in Seenigama, Galle).
Along the way, the riders stopped at five destinations to work with the local communities, conducting humanitarian and community development activities including visiting the three Reverse Osmosis Water Purification Plants (R. O. Plants) built by the group in 2015, 2016 and 2017 as well as stopping by the Methsewa Special Needs Home in Monaragala and the Foundation of Goodness (FoG) Eravur Village Heartbeat Empowerment Centre in Batticaloa and the FoG MCC Centre of Excellence and Sports Academy in Seenigama.
The 2017 ride follows on from the great success of the 2015 charity ride where 20 tuktuks and 40 drivers travelled from the North to the South of Sri Lanka, conducting charity projects and falling in love with the country along the way, resulting in their decision to return in 2017 with an even bigger group.
The Foundation of Goodness (FoG) was established in 1999 to bridge the gap between the rural and urban populations. Operating principally out of Seenigama, the devastation caused by the 2004 Tsunami was a great challenge to overcome, which was seen as a chance to turn a setback in to a blessing by rebuilding the village even better. Establishing the MCC Centre of Excellence and adding a Sports Complex, Diving and Training Centre and 8 outlying Village Heartbeat Projects in the South, East and North, the Foundation grew to deliver humanitarian services to over 35,000 beneficiaries from over 200 villages annually, free of cost, via its 30 productive empowerment sectors.
When the years of conflict came to an end, the Foundation of Goodness extended its development activities to the post-war North and East of Sri Lanka and have been working in the North since January 2011, with uninterrupted monthly visits to introduce, maintain and expand a variety of sports, livelihood and welfare programmes, educational initiatives, and village infrastructure development programmes reaching 35,000 beneficiaries to date, rebuilding their lives speedily.
