JVP PC member requested to submit details on sources of information

Presidential Commission into the Treasury Bond issue:
The Presidential Commission inquiring into the Treasury Bond issue yesterday requested JVP Provincial Council member Wasantha Samarasinghe to submit details on the sources of information depending on which he submitted a report to the Commission.
The request was made when Samarasinghe said the report he submitted to the Commission, received information from media, social forums and other Primary Dealers as well.
The Commission assured that the information on these sources will remain confidential.
Samarasinghe was also advised by the Commission not to use allegations such as 'bond scam' and 'theft', when testifying before the Commission to which Samarasinghe said "I am taught to call a thief 'a thief'. But, I will refrain from using the words out of the respect to the Commission."
Legal Counsel Chanaka de Silva and Nihal Fernando PC questioned Smarasinghe yesterday at the Commission.
Both lawyers suggested the report submitted by Samarasinghe is prepared based on wrong data.
Chanaka de Silva complained that it seems the witness believe all economic problems in Sri Lanka has arisen due to the Treasury bond issue, to which Samarasinghe said it indeed is one main reason.
Adding humour to the situation Commissioner P. Jayawardena said "Even my hair is turning grey because of this problem."
Deputy Governor Nandalal Weerasinghe is to testify before the Commission today. (04)
