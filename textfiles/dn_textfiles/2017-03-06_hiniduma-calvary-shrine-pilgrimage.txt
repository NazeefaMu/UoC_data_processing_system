Hiniduma calvary shrine pilgrimage

The lent pilgrimage season to Hiniduma Calvary Shrine commenced with the Ash Wednesday Service on March 1, at 4 p.m. It will conclude with a thanksgiving mass on April 23, at 8 a.m.
All arrangements have been made by the administrator of the parish Rev. Fr. Ravindra Seneviratne to celebrate the pilgrimage season on a grand scale for the 68th time.
This is the most popular shrine among catholic devotees that is located in Kurusakanda, about 50 km from Galle on the Galle-Neluwa road via Udugama, beside the bank of Gin Ganga.
New stations for the way-of-the-cross were erected at the old Gethsemane near the bank of Gin Ganga for the benefit of the pilgrims who are unable to climb the mount calvary hill. This was done by the former administrator of the calvary shrine Rev. Fr. Ranath Indika Anthony under the direction of the Bishop of Galle Rev. Mons. Dr. Raymond Wickramasinghe. Facilities such as water, electricity, sanitary, first-aid, restrooms are available.
Holy mass is conducted from Monday to Wednesday at 7 a.m, common way-of-the-cross, 7 to 10 a.m., and the holy hour is from 7 to 8 p.m. Common way-of-the-cross and holy hour for Thursdays start at 3 p.m. and 7 p.m., respectively.
Common way-of-the-cross and holy hour for Fridays and Saturdays are from 7 to 10 a.m. and 7 to 8 p.m., respectively. On Sundays, way-of-the-cross is held at 10 a.m. while the holy hour is at 7 p.m.
