Colombo Chamber eyes two  Int’l gem shows in Hong Kong

Chamber is working on to send a delegation

The Colombo Chamber of Commerce (CCC) in its’ tireless pursuit of assisting and providing support to the SME’s of Sri Lanka, has once again facilitated an exciting opportunity for local businesses to gain international exposure through the Chambers networks.
This latest initiative targeting those engaged in the trade of Gems and Jewellery has been collaborated with the Hong Kong Trade Development Council (HKTDC) in relation to two mega events; The Hong Kong International Diamond, Gem and Pearl Show and The Hong Kong International Jewellery Show, which are together billed as the largest marketplace of its kind in the world.
Participants are assured of a robust and well patronised environment which will complement their individual needs in terms of trade and networking. With over 4300 exhibitors expected to participate in this year’s exhibitions (27th February to 6th March), the organisers are confident of drawing a large number of genuine buyers and visitors from over 147 countries and regions.
The HKTDC has therefore mandated the CCC to offer New Overseas Buyers networked through its’ member and non-member categories, the opportunity to receive a Travel OR Accommodation Sponsorship valued between HKD3500 to HKD4000. This rare offering avails not only CCC members, but non-members too the opportunity to visit an International Exhibition of this Global magnitude and reach without too much strain on an SME’s limited budget.
Previous recipients of these sponsorship packages have commented on the great value they had personally derived from previous exhibitions, with some having opted for the Travel Sponsorship whilst those who preferred the Accommodation package in particular commenting on the excellent variety of hotel options that had been afforded to them.
To partake in the limited vacancies for this great deal or for more information and details, please contact MichelleCroos of the CCC secretariat by emailing to [email protected]
