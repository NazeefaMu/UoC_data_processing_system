President’s witty remark on May Day
In his remarkable speech delivered at the May Day rally held in Getambe, President Maithripala Sirisena made a sharp observation about the prevailing weather. It seems that the historic city of Kandy had experienced rain after a long time. Whenever it rains, it is considered ‘bad’ or ‘inclement’ as it disturbs the general human activities. The announcer had also referred to rain as ‘bad weather’. He had gone on to say that a massive crowd is present despite the bad weather.
President Sirisena, a true farmer he is, corrected the announcer’s remark in his speech. How can we refer to rain as something bad, the president quipped, when we had been experiencing weather almost similar to a drought? We cannot agree more when president remarked that the SLFP arrived in Kandy with the blessings of rain.
Most of his rivals, especially within the ranks of the SLFP, have quite a lot of things to learn from President Sirisena. We are passing through hard times when the world is plagued with harsh financial conditions and climate change conditions. What matters more is that we should be able to observe all this in a positive light.
I am certain that the hard times will be over soon.
May the rains fall in due season. May there be a rich harvest. May the world prosper. And we do not need to ask the rulers to be righteous. They have already proven their righteousness. Without a righteous ruler, the rains will not come in season, the harvest will be poor and the world will not prosper.
