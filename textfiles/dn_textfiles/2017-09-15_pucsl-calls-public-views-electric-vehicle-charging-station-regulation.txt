PUCSL calls for public views on  electric vehicle charging station regulation

The Public Utilities Commission of Sri Lanka (PUCSL), the electricity sector regulator, yesterday opened the path for the public to comment on issues pertaining to an electric vehicle charging stations (EVCS) and its users to identify and draft regulatory tools.
The government empowered PUCSL to establish a register of EVCS at each distribution licensee- CEB and LECO, issue code of practice for EVCS, determine end user tariffs, issue safety and other technical standards for EVCS and collect information on a regular basis for monitoring purposes.
Approval was also granted to introduce amendments to the Electricity Act enabling regulatory intervention on EVCS, enabling PUCSL to enforce user tariffs, licensing as well as imposing of safety and technical standards.
Registration of electric cars in Sri Lanka has increased from 90 in 2014 to 3,238 in 2015.
The registration of electric cars during the 2011-2016 period is 4,349. Sri Lanka has also a limited number of electric tricycles, motorcycles, dual purpose vehicles and single cabs.
Around 50 privately owned Electric Vehicle Charging Stations (EVCS) are operating in the country, covering main towns, catering to the growing number of customers using electric vehicles, but remain unregulated due to the lack of legislation.
PUCSL invites stakeholders’ views, suggestions, recommendations, concerns and comments related to areas such as, requirement of maintaining and updating a register of authorised EVCS at CEB and LECO, code of practices for EVCS, determination of end user tariffs, safety and other technical standards for EVCS, rights and Obligations Statement for consumers of EVCS, issues faced by EVCS and consumers of such centres and issues related to residential charging facilities.
PUCSL is to introduce a regulatory mechanism to safeguard the rights of EVCS, consumers of such places in terms of economic, technical and safety aspects.
