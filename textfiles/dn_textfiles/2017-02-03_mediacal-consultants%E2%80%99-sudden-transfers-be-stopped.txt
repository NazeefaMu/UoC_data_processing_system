Mediacal Consultants’ sudden transfers to be stopped

Sudden transfers should not be granted for consultants who have gained specialised knowledge of specific diseases.
The decision has been taken to prevent the public from facing grave difficulties, Media Coordinator to the Minister E.M.P.N.B. Ekanayake said quoting a statement made by Health Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne.
According to Ekanayake, Minister Dr. Senaratne had stated that a lot of problems create when transfers granted to consultants who have specialised knowledge of dengue, malaria and so on. He was addressing a meeting held with consultant physicians recently.
Minister Dr. Senaratne instructed Health Ministry Secretary Anura Jayawickrama to amend the existing transfer system. He instructed to abolish all existing 'acting positions’ and provide opportunity for the doctors to get themselves appointed to high positions, he said.
The minister stated the transfer system existed in the past, allowing some persons to interfere in transfers of doctors, should be stopped, the media coordinator said.
