Rhino sponsors SLIA Archpedia seminar
‘Revisiting building and town planning regulations’

The country’s leading chrysotile fibre cement roofing manufacturer has come forward to sponsor SLIA Archpedia seminar session 2018 which was held at the Sri Lanka Institute of Architect’s Auditorium on June 14.
According to the statement made by Rhino’s Group Marketing Manager, Priyantha Jayasinghe “as a responsible organization, we are always closely working with industry related organizations for the development of construction industry standards. Today’s seminar is also very vital according to the current situation of the country. As buildings and town planning should be regularized according to the availability of lands and the traffic congestions.”
The Sri Lanka Institute of Architects and Rhino Roofing has a long-standing relationship and architects are one of the key stakeholders for the roofing industry as well. Today, house owners want to build housesthat stand out from others with beauty and efficient usage of space. The cost of construction and the shortage of resource availability involved in architectural designing is a key factor for any building.
Our organization has a lengthy history of more than 50 years in the roofing and construction industry. We are closely monitoring our opinion leader’s new developments; accordingly, we are also manufacturing products suited to their requirements. As a result, we have furthermore extended our conventional Rhino roofing sheets, to include color roofing which is called Colorup.
Furthermore, more than different colors, house builders and other opinion leaders are expecting different profiles as well. To meet builder’s requirements, we have recently developed and improved tile appearance by machine painting the sheet and the product is branded as HERITAGE.
In this seminar, Rhino’s Group Marketing Manager, Priyantha Jayasinghe has elaborated onthe importance of socio economic advantages, current developments of the chrysotile roofing industry and their well-known brands, Rhino, Colorup and Heritage product attributes for the participants. Finally, Jayasinghe said with humility that, “we are maintaining the market leadership for so many years with the support of architects and other industry related opinion leaders.
“House builders too have immense confidence in our products and high-quality service rendered to them. Our key success is based on quality and service.”
