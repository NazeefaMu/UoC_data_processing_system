Minister Ranawaka cannot be named as suspect - Magistrate

 
Colombo Additional Magistrate Chandana Kalansuriya yesterday ruled that there is no substantial evidence found against Minister Champika Ranawaka to name him as a suspect in connection with the accident took place in Rajagiriya on February 28.
Delivering his order regarding the incident, the Additional Magistrate observed that he was making this order without taking into account the nature of the person who implicated in the incident but based on the investigation reports and facts including the Government Analyst’s Report, Motor Traffic Commissioner’s report, CCTV footage and telephone records.
The Additional Magistrate further maintained that there is no evidence to prove that Minister Ranawaka had driven the vehicle at the time of the accident. The Additional Magistrate observed that there was a contradiction between the statements given by the complainants what said at the time of the accident and what they said five days later.
“On February 28, the witnesses had maintained that Minister Ranawaka’s driver was on the driving seat. However, five days following the accident, they tendered affidavits claiming that Ranawaka was on the driving seat at the time of the accident,” the Additional Magistrate added.
Meanwhile, the Additional Magistrate ordered Welikada Police to file a charge sheet on August 10 against Dilum Thusitha Kumara, the driver of the vehicle.
Welikada Police submitted to Court that they have concluded preliminary investigations into the incident but they were yet to record a statement from the victim who is currently undergoing treatment at Ragama hospital.
Filing the report of the Government’s Analyst in Courts regarding the incident, the police had informed Court that the concerned motorcycle which met with the accident had been driven at a speed of 71 km/h and the ministerial jeep driven at a speed of 15 km/h.
Submitting a report received from the Commissioner General of Motor Traffic (CGMT), the police told Court that CGMT has recommended that the motorcycle which collided with the ministerial vehicle has an engine capacity of 1,000cc and it could be only used for sports purposes.
Counsel Maithri Gunaratne appeared on behalf of the suspect Dilum Thusitha Kumara (the driver of the vehicle).
