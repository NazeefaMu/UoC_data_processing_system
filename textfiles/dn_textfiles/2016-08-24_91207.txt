Another failed campaign but the cavalcade goes on

Is participation at the Olympic Games is all that matters? Or so it seems especially for a country like Sri Lanka who lives upto to the famous saying of the father of modern Olympics Pierre de Coubertin to the very letter.
One of De Coubertin’s many famous quotes was: “The most important thing in the Olympic Games is not winning but taking part; the essential thing in life is not conquering but fighting well,” and another, “The important thing in life is not to triumph but to compete.”
Sri Lanka’s poor record at the Olympics suggests that the contingent of athletes they send for the Olympics are nowhere close to winning a medal for the country even though certain competitors achieved qualifying standards in their respective events.
One cannot lay the blame squarely on the competitors for their poor show. With their limited resources and finances they try hard individually to achieve success for their motherland, but compared to other countries they are so far behind in training and technology that they are no match when they face the starter’s order.
This where the Ministry of Sports, the NOC and the national sports bodies need to come in. There needs to be long term planning to achieve success where the athlete is given a proper trainer (international if possible), a training schedule and an international events schedule to prepare for the event ahead well in advance so that he or she is at peak when the real action commences.
The lack of international exposure, latest equipment and latest technology has been one of the biggest setbacks for the athlete and there is no long term planning but short term goals when the Olympics is around the corner.
If one is to analyse the comments the nine or so athletes who participated at the Rio Games made prior to their events, none of them said that they were confident of winning a medal.
The average comments made by them were that they would try to improve their personal timings or personal marks. That statement alone suggests how ill-prepared they were going into the Olympics.
Sri Lanka have been taking part at the Olympics since 1948 and all what they have to show is two Olympic silver medals in athletics 52 years apart.
On their Olympic debut at London in 1948 Sri Lanka’s Duncan White won a silver in the men’s 400 metres hurdles. That achievement was equaled in 2000 at Sydney by Susanthika Jayasinghe when she took the silver in the women’s 200 metres.
For the past 16 years, in the last four Olympic Games, Sri Lanka has failed to produce any performance close enough to winning a medal.
What the Olympics have turned out to be is a tamasha for NOC officials and Sports Ministry officials to go on joy rides at state expense.
The NOC is shrewd enough to accommodate officials of the Sports Ministry including the Minister of Sports at every Olympics so that the Ministry turns a blind eye on all the wrong-doings that take place.
Has the Minister of Sports ever initiated an inquiry into why the Lankan contingent fails to bring home a medal at successive Olympics?
They are keen to initiate probes into other sports like cricket for instance whenever the team returns after a disastrous tour, so why not the Olympics where so much of publicity is given for empty returns.
The International Olympic Committee (IOC) provides funds to each of its member-countries and whether they are utilized through the proper chanels is questionable. No one dares question the NOC of how it dispenses its funds.
There have been several allegations leveled against the NOC of how they conduct themselves and on the process of nominating media personnel to cover the Olympics.
The allegations are that those who write in favour of the NOC and have good relations with its hierarchy become their blue-eyed boys and they always find their way to cover each and every Olympics whereas those who are critical of the NOC are left to find their own way to the Games.
This has been the practice that has been going on for so long and the carnival continues unheeded just like the number of officials who outnumber the competitors at each and every Olympics.
Sri Lanka will never learn from their mistakes and as long as this current trend continues they will always be also-rans at every world stage.
