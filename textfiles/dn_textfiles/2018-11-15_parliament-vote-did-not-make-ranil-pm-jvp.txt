Will support to get two-thirds majority for holding polls :
Parliament vote did not make Ranil PM - JVP

Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) leader Anura Kumara Dissanayake yesterday said the No-Confidence Motion (NCM) brought against the Government in Parliament does not indicate that Ranil Wickremesinghe has been accepted as the Prime Minister.
“If a proposal is brought in Parliament to hold national elections the JVP will vote in support to obtain a two-thirds majority,” he said.
Dissanayake was speaking at a news conference held at the Parliamentary Complex yesterday.
The JVP leader said his party had played a proactive role in the no-confidence motion in Parliament yesterday and the JVP does not need any praise or certificates for it. The press briefing was also addressed by JVP MPs Vijitha Herath, Sunil Handunetti and several others.
