Panadura lawyers up in arms against acting magistrate

Lawyers practising at the Panadura Magistrate’s Court complained to the Panadura Chief Magistrate Chaminda Liyanage regarding the conduct of the Panadura acting Magistrate G. D. Perera
The Chief Magistrate had a lengthy discussion with the lawyers regarding the conduct of the acting magistrate summoning lawyers into Court Chambers.
“He is rude and arrogant towards lawyers and does not give a justifiable hearing regarding cases in the bench.He imposes low fines on his clients and heavy fines on the other accused pleading guilty to charges,” a lawyer remarked.
The chief magistrate assured lawyers that he will take immediate action. Panadura Additional Magistrate Kalhari Liyanage was on leave since Monday and attorney G D. Perera was detailed by the Chief Magistrate to act on his behalf.
