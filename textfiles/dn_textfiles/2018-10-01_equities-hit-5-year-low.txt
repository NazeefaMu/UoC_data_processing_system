Point of view
Negative investor sentiment continued to dominate Sri Lankan equity markets, and the ASPI ended the week on a negative note for the 3rd consecutive week.
On Tuesday, the ASPI hit a 5-year low of 5,833.58 (71 index point drop for the day) amid higher foreign selling on the back of worries regarding further rupee depreciation.
The LKR depreciated 3.8% against the USD in the last two weeks, bringing the YTD depreciation on the LKR to ~10.2%. Similar to most other EM/FM countries (which are facing higher currency depreciation in 2018 amid higher US rates), LKR pressure has partially stemmed from rising US rates and the USD.
So far this year, the US Fed has raised interest rate 3 times and indicated that a fourth hike in December is possible while 3 hikes are likely in 2019 and one more in 2020.
Although the Colombo bourse recovered on Wednesday (from Tuesday’s LKR depreciation-led decline) by regaining 55 points, it failed to retain this positive momentum and the Index lost a further 25 points over Thursday and Friday to end the week ~38 points below the 5,900 mark (ie: 5862.18).
Meanwhile, despite Tuesday’s higher foreign selling, the foreign equity sell-off on the bourse eased somewhat over the remainder of the week, with foreign investors recording a net outflow of just Rs.279Mn cf. Rs.743Mn last week.
Subsequently, the YTD foreign outflow on the Colombo bourse increased to Rs.6.1Bn (cf. Rs.5.9Bn).
The negative sentiment surrounding the LKR depreciation was also reflected in the week’s activity levels, and weekly turnover during the week declined 52% W-o-W to just Rs.1.7Bn cf. Rs.3.5Bn last week. Markets in the week ahead are likely to look for cues from next week’s Central Bank’s decision on policy rates.
Inflation eases in Aug’18 despite rising  core prices
Headline inflation at the national level eased in August, in contrast to urban inflation levels which rose over the period to 5.9% Y-o-Y cf. 5.4% in Jul’18 due to food inflation (7.5% Y-o-Y in Aug’18 cf. 5.6% in Jul’18).
The decline in inflation at the national level was largely driven by the reduction in food inflation (0.0% in Aug’18 from 2.4% in Jul’18) while non-food inflation rose to just 4.7% Y-o-Y in Aug’18 relative to 4.3% Y-o-Y in Jul’18.
The increase in non-food inflation was driven by higher i) transport costs, ii) health care, iii) housing, water, electricity, gas & other fuels, and iv) an increase in prices of alcoholic beverages & tobacco.
Upward price revisions to petrol and diesel in line with rising global crude oil prices led to an increase in transport costs while bus and taxi fares including three-wheelers were also revised upwards.
Moderating inflation levels (due to the easing of food prices compared to last year’s higher base prices) meanwhile led ADB to lower its inflation outlook for Sri Lanka to 4.5% (from 5.2%) in 2018 and 4.7% (from 5.0%) in 2019.
The ADB also noted that tightening Government consumption, stagnant fixed investments and lower net exports also warranted a downward revision in the country’s growth forecast to 3.8% in 2018 and 4.5% in 2019.
Meanwhile, greater import dollar demand led the LKR to hit an all-time low of 169.25 yesterday despite CBSL intervention.
The LKR has weakened ~5% against the USD during September and depreciated ~10% so far this year and the CBSL has reiterated that it will intervene during periods of excessive volatility.
