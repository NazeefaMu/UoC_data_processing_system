JVP campaigns against alleged move to sell state assets

The Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) will launch a public awareness campaign from today against what it terms as government efforts to sell key state assets.
JVP leader Anura Dissanayake addressing the media in Colombo yesterday vowed to galvanise people against the move and said its public awareness campaign will start today from the Colombo Fort.
He said selling state assets was not the answer to the government’s economic woes. The government should make a honest appraisal about its performance during the last two years and try to rectify mistakes.
The JVP leader also slammed a proposed move to hand over a majority of shares of the Hambantota port to a Chinese company and also a decision to lease 15,000 acres in Hambantota to another Chinese company to set up a trade zone.
“The people elect a government to use resources in the country with a good management for the development.
However, this government is selling and sacrificing the most important resources that belong to the people. As a political party and trade union movement, we would begin a street struggle against government’s policy of selling and sacrificing country’s resources,” he said.
Dissanayake said the JVP will hold a massive protest in Hambantota on January 5 against the the move.
