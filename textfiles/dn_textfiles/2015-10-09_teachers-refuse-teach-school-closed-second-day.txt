Teachers refuse to teach, school closed for second day

Balapitiya National School was closed for the second day since teachers refused to teach yesterday.
The teachers demanded the removal of 12 students who were involved in anti-disciplinary activities.
The National School director was to arrive at the school for an investigation.
The school was closed abruptly on Thursday morning since 71 members of the 89 member tutorial staff were absent on sick leave.
Only 18 teachers were present and the Principal had to close the school and send the students home.
After the students left, the gates were closed to prevent outsiders from entering the school premises.
Reports said a majority of teachers did not report for duty yesterday to show their discontent over the acts of indiscipline committed by certain senior boisterous students.
