A digital Sri Lanka consumers can trust

As we celebrate Consumer Rights Day today, we need to understand that over the past few decades, consumers had faced a new challenge, and that is the digital economy. The global economy is changing rapidly towards a digital economy, and all stakeholders throughout the globe are working towards building a digital world consumers can trust.
Consumers International has declared the 2017 Consumer Rights Day to have the theme of ‘Consumer Rights in the Digital Age,’ considering its contemporary significance for developing, as well as developed countries in the world.
Over three billion, or 40 percent of the world’s population is online now, compared with just one percent in 1995, and all projections suggest that this number will continue to rise. Although this still leaves many consumers who are struggling to access these technologies, rapid growth of the internet and its usage becomes a vital trend of e-marketing. The proportional increase of smartphone usage and other digital devices has also created opportunities as well as challenges for millions of consumers around the world.
Currently, Sri Lanka has six million internet users, making up 29 percent of the total population. Internet has changed the lifestyle of people, and people have shifted to the internet to look for entertainment rather than watching television or listening to the radio. According to ITU statistics, Sri Lanka has relatively high mobile penetration, which is above the regional average and these users fall between the age groups of 25 to 34 years. They account for the highest number of users with 35 to 44 and 18 to 24 age groups, falling in second and third places respectively.
The internet has also penetrated into rural Sri Lanka, and mobile dominance and high demand for local language content are the key reasons for this trend. Sri Lanka, thus, will experience a new user category of the internet: those who have never touched a desktop or laptop computer in their lives, but are spending around five hours per day browsing Facebook on their mobile phones. They have no knowledge of their own privacy on the internet, and at times, show little respect for the privacy of others. This brings us to the need to have responsible use of social media becoming one of the major concerns of our age.
Even though consumers undoubtedly benefit from increased access, choice, and convenience that these technologies deliver, questions remain on how to improve the quality of services which provide trustworthy and cost-effective services via online servers. Concerns over what happens to the data they share online, and what consumers’ rights and inherited consumer ethics that relate to digital products will affect their buying behaviors. Therefore, consumer awareness and empowerment plays a vital role in promoting the use of digital technology in an effective manner.
In order to harness the benefit of digital revolution for the economic and social development of Sri Lanka, all stakeholders have a collective responsibility to place consumers in the central point in implementing all projects.

The national conference will take place at Nelum Pokuna Auditorium on March 15, and this will be followed by the workshop to be held on March 16, at the Sri Lanka Foundation Institute.

The main objective of the workshop scheduled on March 16 is to critically evaluate and understand the existing situation of the Sri Lankan digital consumer to draft policy recommendations and a road map to strengthen consumer rights in the digital era. This forum will consist of intellectuals, industry partners, researchers, academics, sector regulators, policymakers, and consumer activists.
