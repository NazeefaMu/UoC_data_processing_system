England are not world beaters yet

Smiling supporters were cracking open the champagne on Saturday night but if England are to win the World Cup again, now - this week - is the time to be hyper-critical on and off the field, because they are not world-beaters yet.
The World Cup is three years away and all the teams arrive fully loaded and prepared, which we just haven't seen from the Southern Hemisphere teams this autumn.
England have been tigerish, skilful, resilient, snarling and bloody-minded in recent times
Winning teams crack the whip in victory even more than in defeat and analyse why they are winning, always trying to raise the bar inch by inch in every part of their game. Everybody in the England camp will know that if that had been New Zealand on Saturday the game would have been lost after 20 minutes.
I can guarantee you Eddie Jones won't have glossed over that when he went through his game reviews on Sunday and he will be equally hard on his coaching team on Sunday in their big end-of-autumn debrief.
I trust the RFU will take their cue and do likewise. Instead of patting themselves on the back and reflecting on four lucrative autumn sell-outs at Twickenham, the RFU should be asking themselves what on earth was going on before the appointment of Eddie just over a year ago. Why and how did they mess up so spectacularly?
Why were two totally inexperienced coaches at this level - Martin Johnson and Stuart Lancaster - appointed to the biggest job in world rugby and left steering the ship between 2008 and 2015 with little or no real help or guidance - an era when England should have been just as strong and competitive on the world stage as they are now.
This is not a criticism of Johnno or Lancaster, the complete opposite. The question is for those who put them in those positions. They were asked to do a job they were not qualified for at that stage of their careers. They put body and soul into it but they were the wrong appointments at the time and they enjoyed precious little behind-the-scenes support which their inexperience demanded.
That awful failing of the system should not be glossed over by Ian Ritchie on Monday morning. He appointed Lancaster. Why? If Eddie is prepared to pick apart England's wins on the pitch - which he does constantly - Ritchie should, at the very least, do likewise off the pitch and document England's failures. Because this must never happen again.
Right, that's the reality check over! Having done that let's also take a moment here to congratulate this group of England players and coaches who have worked so hard to restore the pride in English rugby. They have been tigerish, skilful, resilient, brave, occasionally brilliant, snarling and bloody-minded when needed and totally committed.
And they have become a calm team, which is always the sign of a maturing team. Even when they were under the pump in that opening quarter on Saturday and it could easily have gone horribly wrong, I looked around and saw a team who were still together and not panicking.
They kept tackling and battling and bought themselves time and the opportunity to get back into the game.
I have loved watching England in 2016 and am massively excited about the future because they have only just scratched the surface - especially in attack where I am not sure they even realise how potent and dangerous they can and must become. And there is a conveyor belt of talent coming through that will challenge and refresh this group and keep the edge that fierce competition for places brings.
There are options and exciting possibilities everywhere and I genuinely believe that this, finally, is going to be the start of a new golden era for England.
World rugby needs a strong England team, and at last we can say it has one.
