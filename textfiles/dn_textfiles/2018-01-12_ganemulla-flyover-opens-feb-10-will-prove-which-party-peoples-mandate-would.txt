Ganemulla Flyover opens: Feb. 10 will prove on which party peoples' mandate would lie on:Kiriella

The country would see which party the mandate of the people lies on, after February 10, since this unity government has developed the country in a manner that all provinces receive their dividends, said Higher Education and Highways Minister Lakshman Kiriella yesterday.
He made these observations following the opening of the Ganemulla Flyover which stretches across 504 metres comprising of two lanes which would end the three hour delay of vehicles altogether in a day at the Ganemulla Level Crossing.
He further said that the present unity government had implemented many projects to develop transportation out of which, Rajagiriya and Ganemulla Flyovers have been vested to the people. He added that the Polgahawela Flyover is to be opened soon. He also added that the government had already initiated the project of construction of the Kandy - Colombo Express way.
Minister Kiriella said that the government would keep on developing the road network as it was the key for the development of a country. He also said the government would develop the Northern and Eastern provinces in par with the development in the South of the country, as the area was affected by the three decade conflict.
Minister Kiriella said that after the good governance government was established, the members of Gampaha district led by MP Ajith Mannapperuma met him and requested for a flyover for Ganemulla, which had been neglected for a number of years. He added although there were many such requests, the Ganemulla Flyover was given priority along with the other two flyovers at Rajagiriya and Polgahawela.
The Minister also said that the Expressway from Kadawatha to Meerigama of the Colombo - Kandy expressway would be constructed by a Chinese Company, then to Kurunegala by local contractors later to Galagedara by the Japanese company. "This Expressway would be completed by 2020 before the General Election," Minister Kiriella said. "The Indian Government supports us immensely to develop the Northern and Eastern province in par with the South of the country."
He added these roads were developed since many factories would be set up in Hambantota within the next three years. A number of factories would be set up in Trincomalee with Japanese and Indian funds. He added that a free trade zone would be set up in Galagedara area in Kandy. "If we need to set up factories, we have to develop the road net work," Minister Kiriella said. "If not, factories would not be developed."
The foundation stone for the project was laid on April 19, 2016 by Minister Kiriella. The Flyover was built at a cost of Rs 1,768.21 million funded by the Government of Spain.
Around 87 trains travel through Ganemulla to and from, necessitating the closure of the rail gates, as frequently as 90 times per day which causes severe traffic congestion on either the sides of the level crossing.
Tourism Development and Christian Religious Affairs Minister John Amaratunga, Petroleum Resources Development Minister Arjuna Ranatunga, Defence State Minister Ruwan Wijewardena, Pandu Bandaranayake, UNP MP Ajith Mannapperuma participated at the event.
