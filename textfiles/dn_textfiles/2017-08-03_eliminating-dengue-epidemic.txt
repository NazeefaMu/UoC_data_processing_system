Eliminating the dengue epidemic

The first possible solution came two weeks ago, in the announcement by Australia’s Minister of Foreign Affairs Julie Bishop during her visit here that Australia would aid Sri Lanka in its efforts to fight dengue. In the immediate, Bishop said, Australia would provide $500,000 through the World Health Organization, which would support the implementation of a comprehensive Dengue Prevention and Control Plan to enhance hospital triage and case management, cleaning, public awareness and surveillance systems
The deadliest creature on earth is not a great white shark nor a mountain lion; it’s a mosquito. Causing over 725,000 human deaths each year, the mosquito is responsible for the transmission of diseases including malaria, Japanese encephalitis, chikungunya, zika, yellow fever and dengue, among others.
In Sri Lanka, the transmission of the dengue virus by mosquitoes has been particularly bad this year. Since January 1, the Epidemiology Unit of the Ministry of Health has reported over 110,000 cases of dengue fever and nearly 300 deaths. This is a rate over four times higher than the average number of cases for the same time period between 2010 and 2016.
But now, in the midst of a dengue outbreak so bad, it’s being considered an epidemic, there might finally be some light at the end of the tunnel.
Australia Commits To Helping
The first possible solution came two weeks ago, in the announcement by Australia’s Minister of Foreign Affairs Julie Bishop during her visit here that Australia would aid Sri Lanka in its efforts to fight dengue.
In the immediate, Bishop said, Australia would provide $500,000 through the World Health Organization, which would “support the implementation of a comprehensive Dengue Prevention and Control Plan to enhance hospital triage and case management, cleaning, public awareness and surveillance systems.”
Flanked on the stage by Professor Scott O’Neill from Australia’s Monash University, Bishop then explained a second, longer term aid project: the introduction of the Eliminate Dengue Programme to Sri Lanka. Founded by O’Neill as a subset of the University’s Institute of Vector-Borne Diseases, the Eliminate Dengue Programme works by injecting Aedes Aegypti mosquitoes with the Wolbachia bacteria, found naturally in 60 percent of insects, including fruit flies. The Wolbachia bacteria, in turn, prevents the infected Aedes Aegypti from developing and transmitting dengue. Released into the wild, these Wolbachia-infected mosquitoes then mate with other mosquitoes who may have the capacity to transmit dengue and pass on the Wolbachia bacteria, preventing the transmission of dengue from that mosquito population.
Asked about the Eliminate Dengue Programme coming to Sri Lanka, O’Neill said, “It’s great to see our project starting there.” However, he stressed that unfortunately, this was not going to solve the current dengue outbreak.
“It’s not an immediate response to the current outbreak. It takes quite a long time to put in place. And it’s really more of a long-term preventative measure for the country rather than immediate outbreak response.” As he explained, the programme takes time to set up, and will allow for the Wolbachia bacteria to be injected into mosquitoes in Sri Lanka to eventually be released here.
“We’ve just announced the launch of the programme, but the first steps of the program will be us actually designing it with the Ministry of Health. So we don’t have a lot of specifics that we can give people right now about where it will arrive first, because that is still being determined by the Ministry of Health. So the first couple of months are us designing and putting in place the programme design, and then we’ll be in a preparatory phase for 6 to 9 months after that before we are actively looking at communities.”
“Still,” he said, “We’d expect the program to run over the next eighteen months.”
Already, the programme is up and running in multiple countries outside of Australia, including Vietnam, Indonesia, India (in Pondicherry), Colombia, and Brazil. Asked if there were any countries currently implementing the Eliminate Dengue Programme which bared some resemblance to the current situation in Sri Lanka, O’Neill replied in the affirmative.
“In some aspects, I think probably Indonesia is closest to what we’ll do in Sri Lanka, based on the ecology that I’ve seen so far. And the programme we have working in Jakarta, Indonesia is going very well, and I hope that we would have similar results in Sri Lanka.”
Local Solutions
Yet in addition to importing solutions to dengue from outside of the country, there are also solutions to the problem being advanced right here at home. Take, for example, a new biological agent developed by Sri Lanka’s own Industrial Technology Institute (ITI), a form of the Bacillus Thuringiensis Israelensis (Bti) bacteria.
Using local sources of Bti isolated from Sri Lankan soil and water samples, ITI has developed a liquid formulation of the bacteria.
This liquid—a “larvicide”—can be sprayed on standing pools of mosquito larvae and paralyze them, eventually killing them and preventing them from developing dengue and spreading it.
This dengue season, the Bti liquid formulation has been sold to Bio Power Lanka Pvt Ltd., who have produced it on a wholesale level and distributed it to agencies like the Ministry of Health and various municipal councils, said ITI Research and Development Additional Director General Dr. Radhika Samarasekera.
Crucial to the way Bti works is that the bacteria is a biological agent—as opposed to other insecticides, which are more often than not synthetic.
Whereas mosquitoes and their larvae can develop resistance to synthetic killing agents, and whereas these synthetic agents have to be sprayed over and over again to be effective, biological agents like Bti, which are by their definition alive, are harder to develop resistance against, and reproduce on their own naturally. In this regard, biological agents like BTI continue to be effective long after when they’ve been sprayed.
Unfortunately, ITI’s strand of Bti can only be used to kill mosquitoes in their larval phase—not once they’ve matured into adults. As such, until the Eliminate Dengue Programme arrives in Sri Lanka, other methods will be required to try and reduce the rate of dengue.
Such solutions can be drawn upon from other countries who are also attempting to manage outbreaks. In Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, LED street lamps with an artificial human scent have been used to lure and then kill mosquitoes.
Developed by researchers at the University of Malaya, these lamps are powered by solar and wind and produce a low level of carbon dioxide that is difficult for mosquitos to resist. Sucked into a decoy capture net with a suction fan, the mosquitoes are then unable to escape and die.
Prevention still the best cure
Still, as most experts agree, until dengue is completely eliminated from Sri Lanka, the basic steps to take that are aimed at prevention must also be followed, such as avoiding the outdoors during certain hours, spraying repellent, and wearing clothing with coverage. Dr. O’Neill from the Eliminate Dengue Programme said, “Unfortunately, as we know, in all countries, current approaches aren’t working very well. As a result, their recommended procedures are not stopping dengue transmission at the moment in Sri Lanka. But without them, the situation could be a lot worse.
So it’s important that they continue their work Still, he emphasized, there is much room and much necessity for new innovations in our approach to eradicate dengue.
“What’s clear from the experience not just in Sri Lanka, but in most tropical countries in the world at the moment is that the dengue situation is getting worse and we need new approaches.
And we’re quite hopeful that the approaches that we want to bring to Sri Lanka have the potential to have a significant impact, and in the future, to help prevent such large outbreaks from occurring.”
