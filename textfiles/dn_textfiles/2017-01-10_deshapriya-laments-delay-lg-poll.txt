Deshapriya laments  delay in LG poll

The Elections Commissioner yesterday said the continued delay in holding the Local Government elections was harmful for democracy and detrimental to the universal franchise of the people.
Independent Elections Commission Chairman Mahinda Deshapriya, however, added that it was not in his power to call for elections and that such power solely rested in the hands of the minister in charge. Meanwhile, Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna chairman Prof. G.L. Peiris paid a visit to the Elections Commission yesterday morning to insist that the Local Government elections be held soon.
Deshapriya informed Prof Peiris that he did not have the authority to push for such action.
“Prof. Peiris asked me what use was the Elections Commission if I could not call for early elections but we have not been vested with such powers,” Deshapriya said.
“The powers to call for elections rests with Parliament and Parliament has in turned vested it in the minister in charge. Just because we have an Elections Commission, it does not mean we have been given these powers. No country has done that. The establishment of an Independent Commission does not guarantee us such powers,” he added.
The Elections Commission hopes that this election would be held soon and the people’s universal franchise is protected.All parties want the local government elections to be held soon, Deshapriya said.
