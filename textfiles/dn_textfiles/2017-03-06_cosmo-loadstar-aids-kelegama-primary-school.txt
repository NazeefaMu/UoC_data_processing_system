Cosmo Loadstar aids Kelegama Primary School

The employees of Cosmo Loadstar Pvt Ltd in Ja-Ela, Ekala, took it upon themselves to provide much-needed assistance and aid to the Kelegama Primary School, Avissawella, which mostly helps educate children of low income families.
Every year, the employees take the initiative to contribute a part of their income to a social service project of their choosing.
This year, under the leadership of the maintenance team with HR Manager Mahesh Dissanayake, the staff chose to help Kelegama Primary School. The school is located in a remote area, and has few facilities and around 30 children depending on it for their education.
Though lacking in many necessities, it is supported by a committed group of teachers who wants to ensure that their students reach great heights.
The company, thus, had donated school books, pens, lunch boxes, water bottles, and other items needed for the school to help them achieve their respective goals.
