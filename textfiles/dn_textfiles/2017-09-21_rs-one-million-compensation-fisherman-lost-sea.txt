Rs. one million compensation for fisherman lost in sea

Compensation of Rs. one million will be paid for the life of a fisherman lost in the sea, Fisheries and Aquatic Resources Minister Mahinda Amaraweera said.
He said people can earn a sound income by engaging in ornamental fish breeding. He said there are 11 reservoirs in the Hambantota district in which fresh water fish can be bred.
He said the lagoons in the district will be developed so that the freshwater fisherfolk can derive a better income by engaging in freshwater fishing.
