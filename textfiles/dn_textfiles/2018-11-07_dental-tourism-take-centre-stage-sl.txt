Dental Tourism to take  centre stage in SL

Dental Tourism a new segment to the Sri Lanka leisure sector is been added by ORAM (PVT) Ltd, a supplier of dental equipment and services in Sri Lanka.
Managing Director, ORAM, Mushtaq Jabir told ‘Daily News Business’ that ‘Full Mouth Rehab’ (FMR) is a popular dental treatment in Europe and Middle East which close around Rs. 10 million to perform. “This is because it’s a very time consuming process to perform a FMR on a patient.”
He said that back in Sri Lanka clinical chargers are low in comparison to Europe and a FMR could be completed for around RS. 2.5 million in Sri Lanka.” He said that ORAM with several private dental Clinics have now completed over 200 FMR on Europeans and Australians and now want to perform this in a more organised manner. “What we now plan is to offer a comprehensive one week FMR Medical package including air ticket, hotel accommodation, travelling and domestic tours.” He said that several hotels and more rural dental clinics are now been identified to launch this package.” He said that they will also hold special seminars and update the knowledge of dentists and support staff to increase the number of points where FRM could be conducted.”
Currently there are around 100 dentists who are engaged in performing FRM most of them are from the Western Province. The objective of full mouth rehabilitation is not only the reconstruction and restoration of the worn out dentition, but also maintenance of the health of the entire stomatognathic system. (SS)
