Pathfinder Foundation in pioneering tie-up with leading Russian think tank

The Pathfinder Foundation (PF) has taken a pioneering initiative by entering into a collaboration agreement with the Russian International Affairs Council (RIAC) having its seat in Moscow, the Russian Federation.
The agreement, signed by Andrey Kortunov, Director General of RIAC and Bernard Goonetilleke, Chairman, PF, seeks to exchange analytical papers between the two institutions, implement joint projects to strengthen the stance of the two countries in the international arena, including conducting roundtable discussions and workshops; develop interaction between Russian and Sri Lankan institutions in international research activities; and engage in mutual informational support through the respective web-resources and social media channels.
RIAC, a non-profit academic and diplomatic think tank that was established in 2010 pursuant to a presidential decree is aimed at strengthening peace, friendship and solidarity between peoples, preventing international conflicts and promoting conflict resolution and crisis settlement.
RIAC is recognized as one of Moscow’s best-known and authoritative think-tanks. With the former Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov functioning as President and the current Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov as Chairman of Board of Trustees, RIAC has over the past seven years established itself well, within and outside Russia by hosting international conferences, publishing reports on international issues and holding events for young experts, scholars, diplomats and journalists. RIA operates as a link between the state, scholarly community, business and civil society in an effort to find foreign policy solutions to complex conflict issues.
Milinda Moragoda, former Member of Parliament, who held several Cabinet portfolios including the Ministry of Justice, launched Pathfinder Foundation in 2006. PF is an independent, non–profit, non-partisan and advocacy think tank, which has played a catalytic role in promoting economic policy reforms in Sri Lanka. Among the areas focused by PF are promoting market oriented economic reforms, public-private partnerships, promotion of bilateral relations with major foreign countries and people-to-people relations as well as strategic issues.
Under its wings, PF has two centres, viz., ‘China-Sri Lanka Cooperation Studies Centre’ (CSLCSC) and ‘Centre for Indo-Lanka Initiatives’ (CILI) for undertaking research work and promoting multifaceted bilateral relations.
Bernard Goonetilleke, a former diplomat, is the Chairperson and Luxman Siriwardane, an economist, serves as Executive Director of the Pathfinder Foundation and Director, CSLCSC, while Admiral Dr. Jayanath Colombage functions as Director of CILI. Pathfinder Foundation has linked up with an array of think tanks in China, India, and the US and conducts regular programmes, assisted by a distinguished group of experts and academics.
