Citizens' Mail

Rapid growth as a whole
We can be happy about the direction in which this country is steered. Sri Lanka is now geared for a better future, albeit a few setbacks.
Corruption is much discouraged thanks to the painstaking efforts of the two gentlemen in charge of the country’s highest echelons. That has led to radical development in certain sectors. However, a handful of opportunist politicians as well as sections of unscrupulous media showcase fraudulent propaganda to re-enthrone the former regime. They shed acid to innocent people's eyes by propagating all sorts of rumours.
The leaders of the former regime, instead of speaking in parliament or discussing directly with the present authorities, make a miserable attempt to win the common man’s heart. They are not ashamed in passing the rein to the nose of the people thinking that they are foolish bulls or donkeys.
