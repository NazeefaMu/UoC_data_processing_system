Angelo Mathews to captain Sri Lankan team again

 
Sri Lankan Cricketer Angelo Mathews has been appointed as the new One Day International (ODI) and T20 Captain again, Sri Lanka Cricket said.
Angelo Mathews stepped down from the Captainship following a 3-2 loss at the ODI series against Zimbabwe on July 11, last year.  
He recalled the loss to be ‘one of the lowest points’ of his career.
Mathews has led Sri Lanka in 34 Tests, 98 ODIs and 12 T20s earlier.
