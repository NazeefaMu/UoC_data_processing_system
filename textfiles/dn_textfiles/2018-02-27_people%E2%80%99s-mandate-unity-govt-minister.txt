People’s mandate is with unity govt - Minister

The two parties in the governing coalition have obtained a higher mandate than any other party at the local government election, so no other party can challenge the government, said Ports and Shipping Minister Mahinda Samarasinghe yesterday.
He pointed out that the majority is 50.1 percent and not 44 percent and no other party has gained a majority at the election. "So the mandate is there with the UNP and the SLFP and not with any other party," Minister Samaraweera said.
He made these observations yesterday during a press conference held at the Ports and Shipping Ministry auditorium, while responding to queries on the results of the last local government election, from media personnel. He also pointed out that the election was not a general election, but some had attempted to topple the government. He added that there was no interruption to the running of the government. Questioned on an alleged attempt to take over the position of Opposition Leader in Parliament by former President Mahinda Rajapaksa, Minister Samarasinghe said that it was impossible. "There is an Opposition Leader in Parliament. He is TNA leader R Sampanthan. The Speaker has identified only five political parties in Parliament. The position of Opposition leader cannot be given to any other party other than those five."
The Minister further said that MP Dinesh Gunawardena had raised the matter at the Party Leader's meeting on several occasions, but the Speaker maintains the same standard. Questioned of a rumor that there would not be elections within two years, the Minister asserted that it was baseless. He assured that three Provincial Council elections would be held in five months’ time. He added that President Maithripala Sirisena wants the elections to be held on time. "He doesn't even dream of delaying elections," Minister Samarasinghe said.
