I would not have lost Parliamentary seat, if I was in govt: Geetha

Galle district Parliamentarian Geetha Kumarasinghe yesterday said that she would not have lost her Parliamentary seat, if she was in the government.
She said that every citizen has the right to file an appeal against a judgement delivered by a lower court. Therefore, she filed an appeal against the Court of Appeal verdict declaring her disqualification to be a Member of Parliment.
“I am strong enough as a woman to face any challenge and obstacle that lies in my way to serve the people of my district”, Kumarasinghe said.
Kumarasinghe added that she is not worried about the loss of her Parliamentary seat.
“Geetha Kumarasinghe will never get frightened nor disappointed as I have the courage to face any ordeal,”she said.
