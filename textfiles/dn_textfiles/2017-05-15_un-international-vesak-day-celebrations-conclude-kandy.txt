UN International Vesak Day celebrations conclude in Kandy

The UN International Vesak Day celebrations held on a grand scale in Sri Lanka ended yesterday with a special exposition of the Sacred Tooth Relic for the world leaders and delegates at the Sri Dalada Maligawa in Kandy.
The closing ceremony of the UN International Vesak Day celebrations was held under the blessings and guidance of the Maha Sangha led by the Chief Prelates of the Malwathu and Asgiri Chapters with the participation of President Maithripala Sirisena, President of Nepal Bidhya Devi Bhandari, world leaders and delegations from 72 countries.
