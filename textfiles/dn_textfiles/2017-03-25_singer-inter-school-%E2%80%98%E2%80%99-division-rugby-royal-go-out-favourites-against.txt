Singer inter-school ‘A’ division rugby : Royal go out favourites against Isipathana

Royal College will go out favourites against Isipathana College when they clash in their ‘A’ Division Singer Inter-Schools first round deciding league rugby match at Royal College Complex, Reid Avenue today at 4.30 pm.
Royal has won all their matches convincingly and go into this game after having a huge advantage since they are playing in their own den at Reid Avenue.
The Royal team are heavily depending on their skipper Ovin Askey, Nikhil George, Lenox Calyanaratne, Shabith Feroze, Shakir Naufer, Maleesha Madumewan, Hamza Reeza, Janindu Dilshan and Deshan Shenuka Perera to pull this match through and go into the second round unbeaten.
Royal is coached by ex-Isipathana old boy veteran Sanath Martis ably assisted by former Royal old boy and ex-national skipper Dushanth Lewke.
Meanwhile Pathana, the defending league champions have had superb performances in their opening three matches beating Dharmaraja Kandy, St. Joseph’s Maradana and St. Anthony’s Kandy but gave a pathetic performance against St. Peter’s College Bambalapitiya which they surprisingly lost 15-32 last week.
The players to watch from the Isipathana camp are skipper Sumudu Rankothge, Chamod Fernando, Harith Bandara, Dileeka Hettiarachchi, Malesha Ruberu, Nadeeshan Chaminda, Devin Gunaratne, Vinoga Kashawa and Randy Silva.
Their play-maker full back cum vice captain Chamod Fernando's presence in this match is the key factor and its left to be witnessed today.
Isipathana is coached by former old boy Lasintha de Costa and Royal old boy Billal Hassan.
