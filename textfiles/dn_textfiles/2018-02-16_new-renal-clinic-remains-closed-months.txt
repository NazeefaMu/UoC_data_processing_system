New renal clinic remains closed for months

The renal disease treatment unit which was constructed in the premises of the Dambulla Weera Denzil Kobbekaduwa Base hospital a few months ago by the government, has not been opened yet, the public said. According to health officials, around 3,000 kidney patients have so far been recorded in the Matale district, while its number is increasing gradually. While a considerable number of kidney patients were reported from the Galewela and Dambulla areas, the highest numbers were recorded from Wilgamuwa.
Renal patients have to attend the Kandy, Anuradhapura, Kurunegala, and Dehiattakandiya Hospitals to obtain treatment, they added.
The public requests the government to take immediate action to open this renal disease treatment unit for the benefit of the poor.
