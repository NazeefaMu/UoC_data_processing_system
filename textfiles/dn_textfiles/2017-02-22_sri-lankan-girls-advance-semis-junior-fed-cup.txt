Sri Lankan girls advance to semis in Junior Fed Cup

Sri Lanka girls advanced to the semi finals of the Junior Fed Cup with two superb wins against Iraq 3-0 and Singapore 3-0 yesterday.
Girls tennis champion Anika Seneviratne led the way winning the first singles 6/0 6/0 against Iraq’s Nirozh Khalil while Savini Jayasuriya beat Sara Hasan 6/2 6/2 to ensure victory.
In the doubles Anika teamed up with Sathi Silva and beat Sara and Nirosh 6/0 6/1 to give Sri Lanka a clean sweep.
In the tie against Singapore Anika beat Joelle GOH 6/4 6/1 and Savini overcame Tammy Tan 7/6 4/6 6/2 in a close three setter. Anika and Sathi then gave Sri Lanka another victory beating Tammy Tan and Tessa Wong 6/3 4/6 10/8 in a thriller.
A win against Lebanon today is a formality since Singapore beat them 2/1 and will advance as the second place team to the semi finals. Meanwhile the Sri Lanka boys lost both their ties 3/0 to Kuwait and Iraq and are out of contention in this Junior Fed cup tournament.
