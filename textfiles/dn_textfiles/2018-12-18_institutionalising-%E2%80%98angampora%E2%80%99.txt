Institutionalising ‘Angampora’

The Sri Lanka Army by establishing the country’s first-ever Angampora Experiment Institute and Training Centre (AEITC) at the Panagoda Army Cantonment with state patronage added a new chapter to the field of Army sports on December 4, during an induction (Kala Elimangalya) of the Army Angampora group before a gathering headed by Army Commander Lieutenant General Mahesh Senanayake.

‘Angampora’ a martial art that dates back to the times of royalty, has been locally used as a particular self-defence technique, endowed with different characteristics such as astrology, meditation, medical methods, sorcery, and illusory tricks.
It was practised exclusively to resist foreign invaders who, during colonial rule, prohibited this practice in the country since they feared its operational aspect.
The establishment of this special wing was a result of a proposal made by Army Angampora Committee Chairman and Director General General Staff (DGGS) Major General Niyshshanka Ranawana, after the former Army Commander General Crishanthe De Silva (Rtd) introduced the concept of reviving this age-old technique of self-defence in the Army in January 2017.
A total of 130 Army soldiers under the capable tutelage of recognised Angampora instructors whose forebears relate its origins to the times of ancient kings, received training for more than 18 months before they become qualified to graduate.
Those veteran instructors, Ravi Wanakulaarachchi, Anthony Don Wijesinghe and Kala Vibhushana Kala Keerthi Devinda Laksiri Ranasinghe performed a dedicated service to train the 130 Army Angampora players with enthusiasm and commitment.
Lieutenant General Senanayake unveiled a plaque and formally inaugurated the state-of-the-art Angampora practising hall (Maduwa) and witnessed their prowess and skills in this ancient martial art.
The Defence Ministry, Sports Ministry and government officials, having evaluated the significance of the project, have extended their fullest cooperation for the establishment of this training institute as a permanent wing with the objective of popularising this martial art among youth, since the Army has now taken the initiative in this regard.
Chief of Staff Major General Dampath Fernando and Major General Ranawana received the Army Commander on arrival. The instructors’ contribution to the training was appreciated by the Commander with a presentation of mementos.
The Commander’s brief address on the occasion praised all those who worked hard to revive this ancient martial art.
Director General Sports Major General Anura Sudasingha who also took much interest in the project was also present, together with several senior officers including the Army Secretary, Angampora Committee, Lieutenant Colonel J. K. R. P. Jayasinghe.
