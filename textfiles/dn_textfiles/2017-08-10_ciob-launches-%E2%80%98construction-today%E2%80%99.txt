CIOB launches ‘Construction Today’

The Ceylon Institute of Builders (CIOB) launched a quarterly magazine for the construction industry named “Construction Today” at the 6th World Construction Symposium organized by the CIOB held at Hotel Galadari Meriden, Colombo, recently.
Clarifying the objectives of launching the new magazine, the President of the Ceylon Institute of Builders, Dr. Rohan Karunarathne said, “This is the first time that a magazine named “Construction Today” is launched for the Sri Lankan construction industry. The objective of launching this magazine is edifying everybody in the construction sphere."
"It is expected to edify Sri Lankans on the new trends in the world construction sphere, using modern technology, international standardizations, professional standards and international policies.
“Furthermore, it is expected to launch an intellectual dialogue on problems in the Sri Lankan construction sphere and solution for them. To achieve this, we will be publishing valuable and erudite articles by local and overseas veteran professionals and researchers.”
