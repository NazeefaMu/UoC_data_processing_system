'Nobody should interfere with legal proceedings'

The minor political parties which are trying to divide the SLFP to achieve their selfish motives are bound to face the same fate that befell Nasruddin's donkey, Irrigation and Water Resources Management Minister Vijith Vijayamuni Zoysa said.
He made this observation addressing the media yesterday at the Government Information Department.
Minister Zoysa further said that as an Advisor of the party Mahinda Rajapaksa has to play a vital role of protecting the SLFP. Former President Chandrika Bandaranaike and as the Present Chairman of the party President Maithripala Sirisena too have a responsibility to safeguard the party without letting it to be divided.
"By accepting the party leadership, President Maithripala Sirisena has made a great contribution towards the betterment of the party. The SLFPers who are currently holding ministerial portfolios in the government haven't joined the UNP." he said.
He also added that the government of consensus was formed only for two years to face both local and international challenges successfully. "But, we compete at the elections separately".
Responding to a question raised by a journalist about Yoshitha Rajapaksa who is currently remanded in Welikada Prison, Minister Zoysa said that Mahinda Rajapaksa and his family should be protected by the government as former president of the country. "But nobody can intervene with the legal proceedings against him or his family members".
"The team of Pythagoras such as Vasu, Dew and Dinesh were among the first to raise their hands in support of the 100 Day programme of the government. Now they criticizing us," he said.
Minister Zoysa further added that the SLFP lost 30 percent of its minority vote at the recent elections because of a brother of former Presdient Mahinda Rajapaksa.
