‘Palestine still suppressed by Israel’

Late President Ranasinghe Premadasa extended his support towards Palestine in the 1970s, Health Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne said.
Addressing the International day of Solidarity with the Palestine people held in Colombo recently, he said that all former Sri Lankan leaders and regimes extended their support to Palestine. It is the same with the current President and the Government. It is very pathetic that world powers and giants could still not do justice to Palestine.
According to Senaratne, the Jewish acquired lands belonging to Palestine by force and chased away Palestinians from their ancestral lands.
Even the UN has declared that the Jewish ideology is racist, but still it prevails in the world with the power of world giants.
The Palestine parliament does not function because the Jewish arrest Palestinian parliamentarians. Visa to travel to Palestine should still be obtained from Israel.
The condition in Palestine is pathetic, added the minister.
