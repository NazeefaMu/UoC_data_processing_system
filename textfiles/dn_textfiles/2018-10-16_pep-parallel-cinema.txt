Pep to  parallel cinema

If you thought multiplexes were just about blockbusters and mainstream releases, think again. A visit to Scope Cinemas located in the Colombo City Centre (CCC) will change your mind about the stereotyped outlook towards a cinema hall.
Sri Lanka’s first and largest six screen multiplex provides a world class cinematic experience for local cinemagoers. Equipped with state-of-the-art technology and facilities, the multiplex opened doors to movie buffs recently.
A couple of weeks into the new concept had proven it to be a success says Scope Cinema (Pvt) Ltd CEO/ Director Thushan Meemanage.
“This cinema has become the most famous movie location in the country during this period. It is actually double the footfall of Savoy and Liberty together. Though we have not done much marketing and publicity people come purely based on word of mouth to enjoy this new experience. They wish to have better value for their money. We aim to provide them with the luxury at an affordable price,” he said.
The latest in cutting-edge technology like Dolby Atmos Surround Sound and 4K projection has been introduced by the team.
“You have speakers everywhere except on the floor. Therefore when you watch a movie, you feel like you are in it with the characters. We also offer stadium type seating. Therefore even a short person who is seated behind a tall person will be able to view the film without any disturbances,” he explained.
Another specialty about Scope Cinemas in CCC is that they do not run their show times in an orthodox manner.
“Every 50 minutes we have a show time because we do not stick to the typical 1.30 am, 1.30 pm, 4.30 pm and 7 pm show times. Therefore if a film buff comes to our cinema, they will not have to wait to watch a movie for a long span. They can select from seven different contents. The films vary in genres too so anyone who is into films will be able to find something which goes with their tastes,” he said.
The multiplex is not limited to foreign content alone. If a quality Sinhala production comes to theaters the team is willing to let it have a run in their theaters.
“We actually unveiled the cinema with ‘Kolamba Sanniya’. If a producer comes with a good product, our doors are always open for them irrespective of the fact whether they are amateurs or seasoned filmmakers,” he said adding that ‘Udumbara’, ‘Thala’, ‘Tsunami’, ‘1970 Love story’ and ‘Gindari 3’ are scheduled to be screened on the Scope Cinema screens in the future.
“The only parameter we look into is whether the movie will be accepted by the public,” he quipped.
Cinemas for films will be selected according to the show times and preference. The cinema halls offer around 750 seats in the entire multiplex with 220 seats in the Dolby Atmos theater. The VIP cinema is equipped with 24 seats. Around 30 shows will be screened everyday. The cinema also houses facilities for the differently abled. They screen their movies without intervals. They have peak hour and off peak hours for shows.
“There are many youngsters who love to watch a good film at a quality cinema but do not have much money. We give about 40 percent discount for the shows screened during the off peak hours,” Meemanage added.
He says that they are hoping to expand the concept to other areas in the country gradually. He adds that the National Film Corporation’s decision to take over film distribution will have an adverse effect on the industry.
“The Government acts as a monitory body for film distribution in countries across the globe. Film distribution has been liberalized. The moment politics interferes in the industry it will be ruined. We have experienced it in the past. People took the political influences for granted and started shifting away from cinema. Unlike in the past they have other forms of entertainment like cable TV and Internet today. Only those who are politically connected will be well off. People should be given the opportunity to select quality films and reject low quality productions. We have a shortage of good local productions due to this. A good production should provoke your emotions. You need to study other film markets across the world and then make recommendations according to that research,” he concluded.
