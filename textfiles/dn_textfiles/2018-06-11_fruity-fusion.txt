Fruity Fusion!

It’s nice to have jewellery that you won’t see on anyone else. So perhaps it’s even more special to have bling so exclusive that it can only be worn for less than a week.
That’s exactly the kind of creative expression artist Pamela is into. She makes jewellery out of peppers, beetroots, lemons, berries, tomatoes and whatever other fruits and veggies she can get her hands on, and creates lavish photoshoots with them for her fans on Instagram.
She spoke about her extraordinary designs which she works on in addition to running her non-fruit-based jewellery business, ‘Lola Ade’.
Q: How did you get into this type of jewellery making?
I’ve been making jewellery for over seven years now, but I didn’t really tell anyone outside of my immediate family or best friends until two years ago when I finally launched my ready-to-wear jewellery line, Lola Ade.
I’m a lawyer by day, so I felt pretty vulnerable showcasing this other ‘creative’ side of myself that I didn’t talk about for years.
After running my jewellery brand for about a year, I kept getting inspired by literally anything and everything I saw in both my travels and day-to-day life.
My current photo series ‘Raw’ represents not only the raw fruits and vegetables I use to make jewellery, but also how vulnerable and raw creatives feel putting their art out there.
Q: How long does it take to make a piece of fruit jewellery?
It depends on the piece, but anywhere from an hour to a few hours. Fruits and veggies are usually very soft, or delicate materials, so you learn to be patient to execute your vision.
Q: What’s been your favourite design?
They are all my favourite! It’s hard to choose because there is something euphoric about having an idea and turning it into a tangible form.
If I had to choose, the green beans choker is my favourite because it was the first one I posted. I was so nervous that people would think I was crazy, but the love and support was unreal.
Several people asked me how to purchase the necklace which was cool. I also love the blackberry one, and the lemons one was inspired by my love of Beyonce.
Q: How do you make your fruit jewellery? Does the fruit or vegetable not rot?
It always starts with an idea about a piece of jewellery I would actually wear, or I fall in love with a texture and then I try to design something based on that.
I have my regular jewellery tools like pliers and wire cutters, but then I also use kitchen utensils like knives and wood skewers to turn the raw food into edible beads.
I usually store the item in my fridge, but everything is 100 percent raw and fresh so I have to make them and shoot them within a week or they do spoil.
If I know I won’t have time to post about it before it spoils, I usually cook it or eat it and then buy it again when I have time. I only wear them one time, because they are usually pretty heavy, or they start to go limp or soft after an hour or two.
Q: Could you sell these creations?
At the present moment, no, because I’m busy with ‘Lola Ade’, but who knows what will happen in the future?
Q: Any last thoughts to share with people seeing your work?
If you have an idea for something, stop worrying about what people will think. Have faith and just put it out there. Sometimes it doesn’t take a lot to get started on your passion (I use fruits and vegetables!). Look for the beauty and art in everything around you.
