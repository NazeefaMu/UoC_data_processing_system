May Vessak takeaway ignorance, bigotry, hatred towards others: Premier

 
May the full moon of Vessak take away the darkness of ignorance, bigotry and hatred towards others, Prime Minister Ranil Wickrememsinghe said releasing a Vessak message yesterday.
Furthermore the Premier added, ‘may Vessak herald an era of contentment, peace and evocation for the whole world’.
Unfolding the true meaning of Dhamma, the Premier said ‘Dhamma or the teaching of Buddha is a purifying factor for the human mind propelled by lust, hate and violence’.
‘The pious festival of Vesak reminds us the virtues of practicing four focuses of mindfulness in order to dwell with Dhamma as no other refuge’.
‘It is a time for reflection and appreciation of our humanity, and to lead a life full of equality, fraternity, respect and understanding’.
‘The Unity Government is determined to make the prospects of democratic rights of people’.
Concluding his message, the Premier said, ‘on this auspicious Vessak day you may be blessed with the sublime goodness of Lord Buddha!’
