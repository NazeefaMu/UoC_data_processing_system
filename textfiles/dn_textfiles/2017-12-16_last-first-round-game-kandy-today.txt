KANDY SPORTS ROUND UP
Last first round game for Kandy today

Defending champions and table leaders Kandy Sports Club will travel down to Havelock Park today to play their last first round game under lights against number two team of the league Havelock S. C. Kandy S C having beaten all the clubs they met this season, will be looking to repeat that success. The hill country club has opted to name, the squad, what looks like their strongest possible XV for this game. It is Kandy SC’s attacking style of play that helps them to drive their ability to demolish opponents. Up to now in six games they have scored all in all 36 tries. This side has been blessed with some of the country’s best rugby brains, including coaches. If Havelock SC are to do well in their home den, they will have to perform to the best of their ability and more importantly offensively - if they are to be contenders this year. They also need to have more variety in their game.

U-14 Boys & Girls hockey nationals
The All island under 14 boys and girls fourteenth hockey nationals took place at the Asgiriya Stadium from 8 to 10. It was a tense three day tournament, which kept the spectators glued to their seats as all the participants enjoyed watching good games. Thanks to all the boys and girls participants and a big hand to the coaches who had guided the young and budding players from different schools of our country to show their mettle. This was a major step ahead to improve hockey but sad to say the organizing part was not up to standard, facilities for the players at the venue was limited even the match results were not available. Maris Stella College Negombo and Seethadevi Balika Vidyalaya Kandy won the Gold star.
Panda to lead Wariyapola Sri Sumangala
Wariyapola Sri Sumangala College earlier known as (St. Paul’s) College will be led by fly half Panda Wanigasekara, a good player and has a good set of players behind him. Veteran soldier B.B.N. Dharmapala will be the coach. They first played rugger when they were known as St. Paul’s College and produced some good players. It is a school which gives a big hand for rugby. Like other schools, they get a lot of support from their Old Boys Rugby wing.
Dharshana to head Scrummage again
Dharshana Munasinghe one of the top wing three quarters who sported the Trinity College jersey in the early 1990’s is tipped to head the Old Trinitians Rugby Scrummage for another term. Last time he took over from another top ruggerite Rohan Abeyakoon. The AGM is expected to be held on December 18. Among the others who were elected last time were famous ruggerite, basketball player, bodybuilder, actor and Mr. Sri Lanka 99 in modeling Duminda de Silva and Tyronne Smith another top sportsman and a good promoter. Ryde Gold medalist Asanka Ranhotty was elected secretary.

Some of the founders of this scrummage are Kenneth Boteju, Raja Addihetti and Udeni Mollegoda. Thanks to the efforts of these great rugby lovers, today this committee is moving well.
Good news for club hockey
A herculean effort is being made to revive club hockey in Kandy to its former glory days. It is sad to note that hockey has taken a back seat at club level. Some of the veteran players have decided to give a hand, whatever said and done school hockey both boys and girls are at top level. Kandy’s hockey has a long history, it was P.T. Rajan who revived hockey in Kandy in the late 1930s and introduced it to the schools and clubs.
Premier league cricket no clubs from Kandy
Sri Lanka premier league inter club cricket tournament started last Saturday with 14 teams divided into two groups, sad to say there are no clubs from Kandy in the tournament. That is club cricket in Kandy today, with over ten schools playing the game.
Kandy needs a well-equipped ground
Kandy could reign in sports only if another well-equipped ground is provided. Sports is so popular in Kandy and developing fast that today there is an urgent need for another playground, especially for sports like cricket and hockey at school level. These two sports which are doing well at school level, lack ground facilities. Rugby at school level is alright they get sponsors and pay a big amount for ground fee. Cricket and hockey are not in the same boat. A few days back, the under 14 hockey nationals was held and it was mess, there were many team buses from outstations with no place to park. They had to park their buses in the Mahiyawa cemetery and it was sad to see school boys and girls walking from Asgiriya grounds to the cemetary even to have their meals. The Bogambara Stadium was an asset for sports activities earlier when it was under the KMC. But today most of the sports are finding it difficult due to high ground fees and separate payments for marking lines using the pavilion, referees change room etc.
YMCA back with chess
Kandy YMCA, which gives a big hand for Iron sports and Basketball at one time promoted chess in a big way. After a long spell they have qualified for the Chess Super League 2018 with the qualifying tournament held last week where only eight top chess clubs qualified for the super league. A big hand should go to Ishan Wiratunga and the YMCA board members. Ishan was an active chess player in the 1980s and 1990s. However, after a lapse of nearly 15 years Kandy YMCA is getting back to the main stream of chess in the island. In 1994/95 under Vasantha Wethasinghe they won the inter club championship. This time the team led by Bahaya Yaparatne, a product of Vidyartha College became number two in the “B” section and have qualified for the super league which will commence in the coming month.
