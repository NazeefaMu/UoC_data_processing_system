Renovation of 2400 irrigation tanks begins

The inauguration of the programme of renovating of 2400 irrigation tanks began yesterday under the patronage of President Maithripala Sirisena with the intention of recreating the ancient irrigation development in the country.
Irrigation tanks, which were not renovated for a long period of time, in the North, East, North Western and North Central provinces will also be renovated under this programme.123 irrigation tanks in the Polonnaruwa district will be developed in the first phase. The renovation of the ‘Chandana Pokuna’ tank in Hingurakgoda area began under the patronage of the President as the first irrigation tank of this programme yesterday.
This lake provides water to cultivate thousands of acres of land since the time of ancient kings. The ‘Chandana Pokuna’ lake which has a gross water capacity of 800 acre/feet provides its benefits to 300 farming families in the area.
These renovation works carried out with the support of the Sri Lanka Army under the “Pibidemu Polonnaruwa (Awakening of Polonnaruwa)” District Development Project.
The President said that the objective of this programme is to strengthen the economy of the farmer community as well as to strengthen the national economy of the country by giving a new impetus for the field of agriculture and food production.
The President pointed out that under the previous government too similar projects were implemented, but as a result of not implementing properly, those programmes were not successful. The President said it is the responsibility of everybody to contribute to achieve success in this programme to give a better living standard for the farming community in the country.
The renovation activities of the ‘Chandana Pokuna’ was estimated to be around Rs. 16 million. However, later it was decided to carry out renovation with the assistance of the Sri Lanka Army with an expenditure of around Rs. 2.5 million.
Public representatives of the area, including Polonnaruwa District Secretary Ranjith Ariyarathna, ‘Pibidemu Polonnaruwa’ development project director Major General Sudantha Ranasinghe was present.
