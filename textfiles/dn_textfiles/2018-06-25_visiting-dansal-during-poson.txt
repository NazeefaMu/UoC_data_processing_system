Visiting Dansal during poson

This week The Chief Medical Officer of the Colombo Municipal Council (CMC) Dr. Ruwan Wijayamuni and the Health Promotion Bureau (HPB) Director and prominent epidemiologist Dr. Paba Palihawadana speak about health concerns when it comes to organizing Dansel and eating from Dansel during this Poson Season.
According to Dr. Ruwan Wijayamuni, if swelling of ear, lips or tongue is visible within few minutes of consuming food it is a food allergy. If stomach pain, fever, vomiting, diarrhea etc experienced within eight hours of consuming food, it is a possible food poisoning.
Dr. Wijayamuni pointed out that if above symptoms along with fainting, unconsciousness etc experienced after 12 hours of consuming food, it is a possible infection of food borne disease. Certain diseases such as Typhoid can appear even after a month or two from the day of consuming contaminated food. Therefore the public should be careful about the hygiene of food they consume during this season.
It is advisable to offer Dansel that do not promote Non Communicable Diseases (NCDs). Certain types of Dansel such as Ice Cream Dansel promote NCDs, he added.
The people who fall sick with vomiting, diarrhea and stomach pain after eating from any Dansela should inform the condition to the nearest Public health Inspector (PHI) or the Medical Officer of health (MOH), the Health Promotion Bureau (HPB) Director and prominent epidemiologist Dr. Paba Palihawadana said.
According to Dr. Palihawadana, if any person develops vomiting, diarrhea, severe stomach pain etc after some time after eating from a Dansela or any food outlet, he/she should seek medical treatment and until then he/she should take `Jeevani’.
In addition to seeking medical treatment, the patient needs to inform the condition and all the other details to the nearest PHI or the MOH. This is because it can be a food poisoning and a large number of people may in danger, she said.
