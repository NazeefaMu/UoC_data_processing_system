After the end of the first round four teams Royal College Colombo, St. Peter’s College Bambalapitiya, St. Joseph’s College Maradana and Isipathana College Colombo are vying for the top slots in the Singer inter-schools ‘A’ Division League Rugby championships.
These four front runners it seems are going neck to neck to decide to lift the schools league rugby plum.

From the Royal camp the players to watch are their granite hard prop forward Sasitha Siyath and crack centre Janidu Dilshan, who are also their highest try scorers. fullback Dulan Gunawardena is their highest points scorer. They are coached by one of their old boys and former CR & FC and Sri Lanka national captain Dushanth Lewke. Royal College will go all out to defend their league title this year as well and from the way they have been playing so far this season are firm favourites to do so.
The second best team after end of the first round is St. Peter’s College, Bambalapitiya, coached by one of the finest veteran Sri Lanka junior rugby coach and former Isipathana College and CR and FC player Sanath Martis.
