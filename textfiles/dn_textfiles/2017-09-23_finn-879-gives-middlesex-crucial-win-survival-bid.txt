Finn (8/79) gives Middlesex crucial win in survival bid

LONDON: Steven Finn's eight-wicket haul inspired Middlesex to a 36-run win over Lancashire at Lord's and boosted the 2016 champions' hopes of survival.
Lancashire, chasing 221, were bowled out for 184 with Finn claiming 8-79.
Middlesex face fellow strugglers Somerset in their final game.
Haseeb Hameed retired hurt on 23 during the morning session after being struck on the hand by a James Harris delivery, and returned with his side nine wickets down, but did not add to his score.
The 20-year-old England opener, who was later revealed to have fractured a finger on his right hand, had on-field treatment but struggled to hold the bat and left the field for more than three hours.
A broken finger ended Hameed's involvement in last winter's Test tour of India, and his latest injury comes two days after Middlesex seamer Toby Roland-Jones, tipped to make England's Ashes squad, went down with a lower back complaint.
The 20 points collected from this game mean that, regardless of how their rivals perform in their ongoing matches, Middlesex will be safe if they win their final fixture of the season at Taunton, which starts on Monda
Surrey took a firm grip of their match against relegation-rivals Somerset on day three before rain and bad light ended play early at The Oval.
No play was possible after tea but the visitors had already been reduced to 113-4, still 51 runs behind Surrey's first-innings total.
Earlier, Surrey added 105 to their overnight score before being bowled out for 433 with Peter Trego taking 5-67. Kumar Sangakkara was out for 157, his fourth 150-plus score this season.
The Sri Lankan was eventually dismissed as he tried to attack the seam bowling of Somerset captain Tom Abell, but the 39-year-old had already ensured Surrey had earned a maximum five batting bonus points.
Yorkshire, county champions in 2014 and 2015, face a potentially nervy final day at Headingley if they are to claim the victory which would go a long way to avoiding relegation to Division Two.
Already-relegated Warwickshire, 49-1 overnight in their second innings, made 251, thanks largely to skipper Jonathan Trott (59) and Tim Ambrose (49).
That set Yorkshire 175 to win, with 21 overs to face in the gathering gloom. But Jeetan Patel claimed two of three wickets as Yorkshire closed on 56-3.
Only 20 overs of play were possible on day three of the Division One match between Hampshire and county champions Essex because of rain.
Essex moved from 208-3 to 226-3 in their second innings in the 30 minutes of action possible before lunch.
The visitors closed on 247-5, 69 ahead, as Ravi Bopara (57) and Dan Lawrence (101) were both dismissed by Fidel Edwards after a stand of 147.
Philip Salt's maiden first-class half-century on day three saw Sussex set Durham 264 to win at Chester-le-Street.
