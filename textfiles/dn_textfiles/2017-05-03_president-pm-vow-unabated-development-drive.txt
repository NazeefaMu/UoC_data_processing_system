President, PM vow unabated development drive

Yet another May Day has come and gone. There is widespread disillusionment in society about the true motive of political parties in hosting rallies ostensibly on behalf of the working class as they seem to have become propaganda exercises for all the main parties. This year, the parties were extra keen to ensure that they had bigger crowds than usual on account of at least two elections (Local Government and Provincial Councils) that ought to be held in due course.

In fact, one TV station had a rather moving segment in their main news bulletin which featured interviews with people who had to work even on May Day, like the Nattamis in Pettah. They berated the political parties for exploiting the May Day for political gain, saying they would not be compelled to work even on May Day if the workers were truly emancipated. This was one of the most emotional TV news reports I had seen in recent times.
However, for all political parties, May Day is an event that is too good to miss. It helps to show their strength to the electorate and deliver a message to the working class and others that they will take steps, whether in or out of power, to liberate and uplift the entire populace. May Day rallies were held countrywide, but the focus was on the four main ones – SLFP led UPFA at Getambe, Kandy; UNP at Campbell Park, Colombo; Joint Opposition/Sri Lanka Podu Jana Peramuna at Galle Face and JVP at BRC Grounds, Colombo. The Jathika Hela Urumaya (JHU) too held a separate May Day rally, led by Minister Patali Champika Ranawaka, who later addressed the UNP May Day rally as well. (His former colleague and present nemesis Udaya Gammanpila was on the JO stage).
Development goals
The SLFP should be commended for taking the May Day to the provinces for two years in a row. Last year, the rally was held at Samanala Grounds, Galle and this year at Getambe Public Grounds near Kandy under the patronage of President Maithripala Sirisena, who is also the leader of the SLFP. In a scathing speech aimed at his detractors, President Maithripala Sirisena said he would never betray the country or consent to selling its vital resources. He assured that the new Constitution would not do away with Buddhism’s foremost status. He said victory was assured at the forthcoming elections as there is a massive people’s movement around the SLFP, which is now giving prominence to the original Hand symbol. This had faded almost into obscurity under the previous regimes which contested under the Betel Leaf symbol of the United People’s Freedom Alliance (UPFA).
The UNP showed its might in the traditional home base of Colombo, as supporters from all parts of the country thronged the Campbell Park. Prime Minister and UNP Leader Ranil Wickremesinghe took a swipe at former President and Kurunegala District MP Mahinda Rajapaksa for what he called “machinations aimed at crippling the Government’s development drive”. The Prime Minister said the Rajapaksas would have to remain in the political wilderness for decades to come when the Government’s development goals are achieved. The Government would go ahead with international collaboration in development programmes, he added.
As usual, the JVP rally that began from S.De. S. Jayasinghe Grounds, Dehiwela, had the best floats and slogans from a political point of view. They also had the most elaborate and complex stage, a feat achieved year after year. JVP Leader Anura Kumara Dissanayake, while criticizing the Government’s “lack of vision and penchant for selling State resources” however reserved his harshest words for former President Rajapaksa, who he said had no moral right to hold a rally at Galle Face after allowing the Chinese to reclaim and own 600 acres near the Galle Face. He reminded the audience that the former leader also endorsed the sale of the Army headquarters land to the Shangri La Hotels Group. He told the gathering that only the JVP could reverse the present “dangerous situation” in the country.
Speaking at the May Day rally of the Flower Bud party SLPJP, which for all intents and purposes acts as a cover for the Joint Opposition, former President Rajapaksa said he had successfully faced the challenge of filling the 18-acre Galle Face Green and urged the Government to hold the Local Government and Provincial Council elections. He alleged that the present Government had stopped all the development projects he initiated citing a debt trap. Several speakers including Rajapaksa and Wimal Weerawansa (who made his first major public speech after being released on bail) said the JO “cannot and should not wait” till 2020 to topple this Government. They did not specify how this could be done democratically, since there is no national election till 2020, other than saying that “people’s power” was behind them.

While the JO speakers pointed out the crowd size as an indicator of their popularity ahead of the LG Polls, it is rarely an absolute indicator of success at the polls themselves. In other words, crowds do not necessarily translate into votes. When President Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga took over three ministries of the then United National Front (UNF) Government while Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe was abroad, large crowds gathered at the Bandaranaike International Airport and on both sides of the road to express their solidarity with him. However, the UNF lost the General Election next year (2004). During the 2010 Presidential Election campaign, Common Candidate General Sarath Fonseka’s rallies were bursting at the seams, but his opponent, the incumbent President Mahinda Rajapaksa took 57.88 percent of the vote as against 40.15 percent for Fonseka.
Contrasting views were expressed on the National Unity Government and the concept of power sharing in the future, even by speakers on the same stage. While the majority of speakers on both SLFP and UNP platforms called for the formation of either a SLFP or UNP Government as the case may be, a few spoke in favour of continuing the present arrangement even beyond 2020.
Beyond the main parties, there was not much traction at other rallies, though the estate-centred parties did have successful rallies in Hatton and Thalawakelle. Kumar Gunaratnam’s Frontline Socialist Party (Peratugamis) simply could not match the rival JVP in terms of flair and crowd size. The smaller socialist parties held several low-key rallies and meetings which were sparsely attended.
Death anniversary of President Premadasa
May Day also marked the 24th death anniversary of President Ranasinghe Premadasa, who was assassinated by a LTTE suicide bomber on May 1, 1993. President Sirisena, Prime Minister Wickremesinghe, Speaker Karu Jayasuriya and Minister Sajith Premadasa were present. The day also marked the 126th birth anniversary of pioneering labour leader A.E. Gunasinha, a former Mayor of Colombo known as the father of the labour movement in Sri Lanka who was instrumental in holding Sri Lanka’s first May Day events in 1933.
All May Day events were held peacefully, in contrast to some other countries including France and Turkey where demonstrators turned violent. The Police deserve a big “thank you” for working tirelessly to ensure the safety and security of all participants of May Day rallies.
No crossovers materialized during the May Day rallies, although both the SLFP and the JO had expressed confidence earlier that at last a few would change sides. Janaka Bandara Tennakoon, who was displaced as party organiser for Dambulla last week, was seen at the JO rally, but he was always identified with that camp. In addition to Tennakoon, Parliamentarian Lohan Ratwatte (Pathadumbara) and Mahiyangana electorate organiser Anura Vidanagamage were sacked from their posts of electoral organizers. They were known as supporters of the JO. Provincial Councillor W.M. Yasamanna and Dambulla Trade Union president U.R. Dayanandasiri were appointed co-organisers for the Dambulla electorate by President Maithripala Sirisena. Former Pathadumbara Pradeshiya Sabha Chairman W.M. Samaraweera Bandara Welagedara was appointed for the Pathadumbara electorate in place of Ratwatte. The Mahiyangana electorate will be overseen by K.G. Gunawardane.
This serves as a warning to the remaining JO members who still retain their SLFP organiser posts. The Party had earlier warned all SLFP MPs to attend the May Day rally at Getambe. It remains to be seen what kind of action the party will take against the SLFP dissidents including Rajapaksa himself who attended at the JO rally at Galle Face Green. The party did not take any immediate action last year, but a number of JO MPs lost their electoral organiser posts in a similar purge a little while later.
However, the SLFP hierarchy is also acutely aware of the need to unify the party ahead of any national election in 2020, so it may opt not to take any measures which may seem to be too harsh. After all, both sides are aware that any further rift in the SLFP can only benefit the UNP which too has expressed the desire to form its own Government in 2020. Nevertheless, at this stage it is still not clear whether co-habitation will continue or cease after 2020. The next three years will be crucial for deciding whether this unique experiment in local politics can continue in the next decade as well.
Industrial peace, essential services and law and order
The other major issue that cropped up last week was a suggestion to give wider powers to a unit to be established under Field Marshal Sarath Fonseka apparently to ensure industrial peace, essential services and law and order. All newspapers reported that the President had made this suggestion at the weekly Cabinet briefing, based on a statement made by co-Cabinet spokesman Minister Rajitha Senaratne at the weekly Cabinet news briefing. It did not take long for contradictory statements to appear, with Minister S.B. Dissanayake saying the President was only joking. Fonseka himself said he would not be in charge of the military and police even if such a unit is established, but added he would serve in any capacity if it can be beneficial to the Motherland. Minister Senaratne later stood by his original statement and accepted “full responsibility”.
As expected, the Opposition, especially the JO, cried foul saying the Government was getting ready to clamp down on trade unions and opposition parties. Several Government ministers were quick to recall the killings of Roshen Chanaka, Anthony and Rathupaswala protestors during the previous regime. Senaratne and several other ministers directed their ire at Minister John Seneviratne who was critical of the proposal to bring Fonseka in to address emergency situations. Seneviratne had earlier caused a stir when he said that talks were underway to appoint former Defence Secretary Gotabhaya Rajapaksa as the “second leader” of the SLFP. Many SLFP ministers were quick to deny any such move and denounce Seneviratne.
UN Vesak Day celebrations
All arrangements are being finalized to hold the UN Vesak Day celebrations in Sri Lanka from May 10-12. Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi is expected to grace the opening day events, while the Nepali President is due to attend the closing day events. His visit comes in the wake of the controversy caused by the Trincomalee oil tank farm issue. The Opposition, especially the JO and JVP, have alleged that the Government is trying to sell the facility to India. They speculated that an agreement in this connection would be signed during Prime Minister Wickremesinghe's visit to India failing which, they said the agreement would be signed during Modi’s visit to Sri Lanka. Both the President and the Prime Minister have categorically rejected these allegations. Vesak is no occasion for politics and we hope that all parties would keep politics away during the Indian PM’s visit. After all, Buddhism itself is India’s greatest gift to Sri Lanka.
The Government also scored a major diplomatic victory when an overwhelming majority of European Union MPs defeated a motion to deny GSP Plus benefits to Sri Lanka last week. The Government still has to pass one more hurdle as the European Commission itself will decide whether to restore GSP Plus to Sri Lanka or not by mid month. Judging by the vote in the EU Parliament, Sri Lanka should not experience any problems in this regard. The restoration of GSP Plus will be a major bon to the economy as well as a diplomatic and political victory for the Government.
