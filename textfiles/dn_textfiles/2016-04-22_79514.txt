The UNP rally to be held at Campbell Park is scheduled to start at 2.00 p.m. The May Day procession will start at 11.00 a.m. opposite the B.G. Sirisena public playground.
The UNP General Secretary was in Matara to discuss the parties progress with the UNP organisers of Matara district. Foreign Affairs Minister Mangala Samaraweera who celebrated his birthday yesterday and Co-Chairman of the Matara District Development Council and Member of Parliament Buddhika Pathirana were present at the media briefing.
“This is the first May Day rally that the new government will be holding after being elected on August 17, last year. There are many people including our leader Ranil Wickremesinghe who made sacrifices for the party and the country. It is a committed workforce that we need to pull this country out of the debt trap it is in and bring Sri Lanka back to where it should be. That’s why our first May Day rally will be dedicated to the people with commitment,” Hashim said. “When former President Mahinda Rajapaksa was elected in 2005 the per capita debt was Rs. 110,000 and the country’s foreign debt was US$ 21 billion. But at the end of his tenure in 2015, the per capita debt was Rs. 452,000 and foreign debt was US$ 44 billion,” he said.
“In the short time we have been office we have been able to establish an environment in which people can work with dignity.
“We have increased the salaries of government sector employees and requested the public sector salaries to be increased. This is how we showed our appreciation to the dedication and commitment of our national work force,” he added.
“It is because of the commitment of the leaders and people that countries like Singapore and Korea are economically stable today,” Hashim said.
