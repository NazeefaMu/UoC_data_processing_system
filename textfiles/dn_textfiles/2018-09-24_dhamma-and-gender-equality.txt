Dhamma and Gender Equality

The most significant happening on Binara Poya day was the admission of females to the sasana or founding of Bhikkuni Order. Maha Prajapati Gotami’s determination and commitment in making numerous requests to Buddha for the admission of female candidates to the order made it possible. Prajapati Gotami, a role model for women-folk; was Queen Mahamaya’s [Buddha’s mother] sister. The Buddha was residing at Kapilavasthu’s Nigrodharamaya when she approached him pleading his consent for women to enter the sasana. They say, the Buddha after turning down the request three times, finally allowed the admission to the order on ‘conditions’? It was granted on a Binara full moon Day. Among prejudiced religious practices, Buddhism can definitely claim to have the least prejudices against women.
Bhikkhuni order introduced to Sri Lanka by Theri Sanghamitta during the reign of King Devanampiya Tissa flourished in the island for about 13 centuries and disappeared after the Chola invasion in the 11th century. As described in the in the great chronicle Dipawansa, Bhikkhuni order established became advantageous to the Sasana. Hindu influence changed the practice of Buddhism during the Polonnaruwa era that followed five decades of Chola rule where anti-feminism and caste system was featured in sasana that ended with the expulsion of Cholas by Wijayabahu. Such influences affected the Buddhist thought resulting in the denunciation of any attempt to revive the Bhikkhuni order.
In the Cullavagga of the Theravada Vinaya, for the proper functioning of the Buddha sasana, it is an essential requirement to have all four types of assemblies of disciples, [Bikkhu, Bhikkhuni, Upasaka, Upasika] one of which is bhikkhunis.
Buddha and Bimbadevi
The emotional meeting between the Buddha and Bimbadevi took place at the palace in Kimbulwatt-pura, 26 centuries ago when the king sent a message to Bimbavo, for her to reply in the negative,
“Surely, if I am worthy of any affection, Sidhuhatt will come and see me”.
The Buddha having made inquiries, and being told that she had declined to appear, invited his two chief disciples, Sariputta and Moggallana to accompany him to her chambers, demonstrating his modest qualities and courteous regard for the lady, his former partner in sansara advised others, “Bimbadevi not having seen me for a long time, she is extremely distressed, unless you allow its natural course her heart will slash. In the event she touches the Tathagata [Buddha], please do not attempt to obstruct her”
She was relaxing in her abode dressed in uncaring clothes, and head shaved. As the Buddha entered, like a spilling over bowl she was unable to hold her high regard. For a moment she failed to remember that he is the lord of the world, Yasodhara held him by his feet and sobbed desperately. However, realizing the king’s presence, she rose up and took a seat.
The principle of Reciprocity and Non-dominance
In Buddhism as a general rule, the relation between the genders is governed by the principle of reciprocity and non-dominance.

Sumedha and Samitha in Paduma Jataka
In many traditional past lives of the Buddha[Jataka], Siduhatt and Yasodharavo lived as husband and wife. The accord began with Paduma Jataka where Sumedha thapasa, a young Brahmin acknowledged as a future Buddha by the then Dipankara Buddha, while waiting for Dipankara Buddha to arrive in the city of Paduma, he being unsuccessful in buying flowers as offering for the enlightened one, as the king had already taken all the flowers, notices a girl carrying some lotuses in her hand and offers her money with the intention of buying at least one of the flowers. It ended with love-at-first-sight for both the young hearts. Samitha the girl, offered five of the flowers free to the boy, but on condition that he weds her and would continue to do so in all future lives as well.
The concord continued as they wished; she had been a great strength to him with her devotion, her purity, and had been precious to him until he aimed at Buddhahood. This resulted in countless merits. Also known by other names, Bajjacatchayana, Rahula matha, Bimbavo her sorrow in her last birth was unspeakable, but her dignified approach miraculously transformed all worries into divine contentment. The blessed one recognized her patience and sacrifice that facilitated his achievement not only in this birth but in earlier births too. Buddha on this occasion said, “I will acclaim the honourable qualities of Bimbavo in her own house by linking the Cannda-Kinnara Jataka, a touching account of the couple in one of their preceding births, born in the confines of Himalayan range as fairies.
The Buddha’s invitation for women to contribute to the sasana by making them qualified to enter the Bhikkuni Sangha – with ample openings for public life had greatly enhanced the status of women. A number of books have been authored in Islamic and Hindu societies on the changing standing of women, but strangely little in Buddhism—Miss I.B. Horner, Pali scholar in 1930 wrote a book titled, ‘Women under Primitive Buddhism’. Buddha’s teachings undeniably have the least prejudiced approach against women. Their importance to society was recognized very much enhancing their rank among men.
Myth of Garudhammas
The Buddha's decision in sanctioning the establishment of an Order for women, in the fifth year after his enlightenment was blemished by the inclusion of garudhammas on them. Who incorporated them in the Bhikkhuni Vinaya rules? They are nothing but attachments by male chauvinists.
The rules blatantly subordinate Bhikkhunis to Bhikkhus. Rule four recognized the bullying to which Bhikkhunis would be exposed to. Concessions to male superiority are seen in laws 1 and 8. Rule 1 has been the most irritating in practical terms and obviously discomforting in societies where the salutation observance was strict.
Why should a Bhikkhuni always pay reverence to a Bhikkhu however junior the latter may have been? Chronicle says Theri Prajâpati Gotami, despite Ananda Thera’s support was unsuccessful seeking immunity from this rule. Obviously, they are not backed by Buddha’s initiative or idea.
1. Bhikkhus to have precedence over Bhikkhunis in matters of salutation, irrespective of any other considerations like age and seniority.
2. Bhikkhunis could not observe the annual ‘vassana’ in a district where there were no Bhikkhus.
3. Bhikkhus set the dates for Bhikkhuni Uposatha ceremonies.
4. Confessing lapses by Bhikkhunis had to done before the assembly of both Bhikkhus and Bhikkhunis.
5. Judicial processes in case of Bhikkhunis had to be undertaken by both the Sanghas.
6. Upasampada initiation of Bhikkhunis to be given by the Bhikkhu Sangha as well.
7. A Bhikkhuni should never abuse a Bhikkhu.
8. Bhikkhus can admonish Bhikkhunis, but not vice versa.
Nuns’ ordinations give women the chance to choose out of an often harsh male domination system and take part in almost equal partnership with the male monks. It meant that the Sangha, both men and women, that laymen take refuge would now include of both monks and nuns.
The Buddha took precautions like a parent, to protect Bhikkhunis from the dangers of the wandering ascetic lifestyle; the same opportunities on the trail of practice. The Buddha thereby built protective measures into the monastic rules, the Patimokksha, in order to secure the nuns.
