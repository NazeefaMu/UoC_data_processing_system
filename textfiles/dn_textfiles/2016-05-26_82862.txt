PARLIAMENT

 
Petition filed by former MP against Speaker's ruling:
Contrary to Constitution and breach of Parliamentary privileges - PM
The petition filed by former Parliamentarian Sarath Weerasekara before Court against a ruling by the Speaker on the resolution moved in Parliament on the National Government, was contrary to the Constitution and also a breach of Parliamentary privileges, said Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe.
He made this observation yesterday in Parliament raising a privilege issue and seeking for a ruling of the Speaker on the issue on a future sitting day as yesterday was fixed for discussions on the adverse weather conditions and its effect on the people.
The Premier further said the petition had been filed and notice served on him contrary to the Constitution by Rear Admiral Dr Sarath Weerasekara and Professor Wimaladharma Abeywickrama against himself and few other parliamentarians.
“On September 03, Speaker Karu Jayasuriya made a ruling on the resolution on the national government and what the parties needed for the resolution,” the Premier said. “In accordance with it, I presented the resolution and the same was carried by Parliament.”
He further said that it was final and the Speaker's decision could not be challenged. He added that it was part of the powers of the House.
“But I have been noticed to appear in Court or my counsel to answer to something that I had done under rulings given by the Speaker and very importantly, the petitioner had said that he was the only MP who voted against the passage of the Nineteenth Amendment to the Constitution,” the Premier said. He challenged the whole resolution as to how a national government should be made. He did not mention that the resolution had been passed.”
The premier further stated that the petitioner had said the purported determination passed by Parliament was no force or effect in law.
“All these amounts to challenging the rulings given by you in the House by exercising our powers under Article 4 and 4(c)”, the Premier said. “When you challenge the decision of the House, you are in breach of privilege. It is done willfully, as the petition does not disclose the decision given by the Speaker.”
The Premier also said the petitioner was aware of having being a member of Parliament.
“It does not disclose the powers of Parliament that judicial powers are vested on us through us,” the Premier said. “Even if you go on a Fundamental Rights procedure, you have to disclose the powers of Parliament and this is mala fide done wilfully.”
He promised to go into this matter and give a ruling on this breach of privilege by Sarath Weeasekara and Professor Wimaladharma Abeywickrama.
‘People should join hands to face disasters’
People should join hands to face the adverse consequences of natural disasters as it seriously lacks the necessary resources, Opposition Leader R Sampanthan said in Parliament yesterday.
He was participating in the adjournment motion moved by the Government on relief measures and damages caused by floods and landslides.
“Weaker sections of society have suffered the most from this calamity. We have a responsibility to look after them. I urge the Government to make its best efforts and do everything possible to mitigate the sufferings of the people. Affluent sections of society must be called upon in some way to help the weaker sections who have been affected,” he said.
The Opposition Leader also pointed out the need to have better disaster preparedness in the country, especially in disaster prone areas.
EP CM must apologize to Naval officer - Wimal
NFF Leader MP Wimal Weerawansa yesterday called on EP CM to make a public apology to the Naval officer he reprimanded, addressing a Joint Opposition media briefing at the Parliamentary complex.
“Chief Minister Nazeer Ahmed behaved in a disgraceful manner. Not only did he scold Captain Ranjith Premaratne of the Sampur Camp, but he did that in the presence of US Ambassador to Sri Lanka Athul Keshap. We demand that he make a public apology,” he said.
MP Weerawansa also queried what action the Government would take in this regard if the Chief Minister did not make an apology. The incident took place during a prize-giving at the Trincomalee - Sampur Maha Vidyalaya.
“The Chief Minister had not been invited for the event. He had gate-crashed. Thereafter he talks of protocols and demands his due place,” MP Weerawansa said.
Meanwhile addressing the same press conference, UPFA MP Dullas Alahapperuma dubbed the proposal of the Government to give official vehicles to MPs as a bribe to bait Opposition MPs for the Government.
 
‘New laws to deal with disaster management’
New laws would be formulated to deal with disaster management, said Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe yesterday. He also said that there are flaws in the existing process of dealing with disastrous situations in the country.
He made these observations yesterday joining discussions on the adjournment motion moved by UNP Parliamentarian S M Marikkar on the adverse weather situation and suggesting that the relief granted by the government should continue. The Premier further stated that he had discussions with President Maithripala Sirisena last Monday concerning a process to provide relief to the affected people in disasters that would take place in high risk areas and others places in future.
The PM also thanked the employees of the public service who rendered a commendable service during this disastrous situation. He thanked the Tri-Forces, the Police, religious dignitaries, foreign institutions and foreigners, volunteer groups and others who volunteered to help the people.
 
‘Fifty schools in Kandy in landslide prone areas’
Fifty schools within the Kandy Districts are located in landslide prone areas as alerted by the National Building Research Organization (NBRO), Water Supply and Urban Affairs Minister Rauf Hakeem said in Parliament yesterday.
He was participating in the adjournment motion moved by the Government on relief measures and damages caused by floods and landslides. “The NBRO had repeatedly warned of threats of landslides in areas where landslides occurred over the past few days. It has drawing the attention of the government on the need to evacuate and resettle these people. In Kandy district alone, there are over 50 schools for which the NBRO had alerted on the possibility of landslides. It had warned the use of several buildings of these schools. I urge the Disaster Management Minister and Education Minister to pay attention to these schools and provide them with required building facilities in safer areas. In addition to Kandy, Ratnapura and Kegalle too have many schools that face similar dangers,” he said.
 
Wimal accuses monk, officers of removing Buddha statue
NFF Leader MP Wimal Weerawansa yesterday accused that a Buddhist monk and certain officers at the Prime Minister’s Office had allegedly taken away a seated bronze Buddha statue by force from the National Museum and had damaged it, addressing a Joint Opposition press conference at the Parliamentary Complex. He said the government should take action against those who are responsible for the robbery of this ancient Buddha statue belonging to the Anuradhapura era.
“The loss from this alleged irresponsible act is heavy. These antiques at the Museum are not play items. They belong to the future generation of this country. This is clearly a crime. The Director had put on record that the statue had been taken away while she opposed it and would not accept it again nor be responsible to what happens to it. Is this the good governance that the Government preaches” he asked.
‘Conservation plan for central hills an urgent need’
A conservation plan for the central hills is an urgent need, Chief Opposition Whip and JVP Leader Anura Kumara Dissanayake said in Parliament yesterday.
He was participating in the adjournment motion moved by UNP MP S M Marikkar on relief measures and damages caused by floods and landslides.
The MP said the destruction of forest cover in the central hills has resulted in the rising of water levels in rivers, adding that mountainous areas from Knuckles to Rakwana, have faced serious destruction over the recent past. He pointed out that tea and cardamom cultivations have been spreading into forest lands nearby the Knuckles Range and the Sinharaja forest. “Horton Plains and Sri Pada are also facing the same situation. Hotels in these areas should be removed,” he said.
He said as of environmental regulations, every river with a width of over 50 metres should have a 60 meter buffer zone. However, he pointed out that the eco-system of the Kelani River had been destroyed.
‘Lack of warning system reason for carnage’
If there had been an effective warning mechanism, the loss of lives and damages to vehicles could have been lessened to a great extent, former President and Kurunegala District MP Mahinda Rajapaksa said in Parliament yesterday.
He was participating in the adjournment motion moved by the Government on relief measures and damages caused by the floods and landslides.
However, he said the responsibility of politicians at this moment is not to criticize, but to do whatever possible to help the affected people. “We should shed party politics at this moment and think how we could help the people. I urge the Government to keep faith on government officials.
The government should encourage them to come forward and take necessary steps. I say this, because I have noticed that some officials hesitate to take urgent decisions. In the recent past, we faced a massive flood disaster in 1958, a massive cyclone in 1977 and a Tsunami catastrophe in 2004. Those who have experience on such catastrophes are still in public service and the tri-forces. They have the strength to face such situations,” he said.
