Livelihood Support for War Widows: A Reconciliation Initiative

The Ministry of National Integration and Reconciliation, under the direction of President Mithiripala Sirisena, has taken initiative to provide livelihood support for war-affected widows as a first phase initiative in the conflict-affected Northern Province under the project titled "Healing mind for dignified life" covering Jaffna, Kilinochchi, and Mullaitivu Districts, said Ministry of National Integration and Reconciliation Secretary V. Sivagnanasothy.
Under this programme, livelihood support of Rs.100,000 is provided to women-headed families covering war widows, women who have lost their breadwinners, women-headed families with missing and disabled persons, women-headed IDPs and refugee returnees, and rehabilitated ex-combatants who are caught-up in the poverty trap. "This programme was launched to mark international women's day," said Sivagnanasothy.
One hundred and thirty two women-headed families are covered under the first phase of the programme. The total cost of the programme is Rs.14 million. This programme will be extended to many families in near future. Urani village in Tellippalai, Jaffna, which was under the custody of Sri Lanka forces, has been released and Ministry of National Integration and Reconciliation has initiated a land mark project to construct anchorages and landing sites for the fishing community for which Rs. 4.6 million has already been released to the District Secretary. A large number of fishing families will benefit from this anchorage and landing sites, and it will also re-establish their livelihood and help to mainstream into the national development initiatives, said Sivagnanasothy.
