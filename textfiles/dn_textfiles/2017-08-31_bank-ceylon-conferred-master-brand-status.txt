Bank of Ceylon conferred Master Brand status

The Bank of Ceylon was conferred the Master Brand status for the year 2017- 2018 by the CMO Council Asia at the ceremony held at Taj Samudra Hotel, Colombo, recently.
Named as the No.1 brand in the country for over nine consecutive years by Brand Finance Sri Lanka, the Bank of Ceylon currently holds the highest brand value in the country which is Rs. 40 billion.
Since its inception, Bank of Ceylon’s motive has been the same – that is, promoting social and economic development of the country and its people.
As such, the BOC brand has been strategically adapting its product and service portfolio with a good understanding of future social and economic trends that require tailor-made banking and financial services. It has been a trusted financial partner to clients for over 78 years and has reached extraordinary milestones such as surpassing Rs. one trillion assets in 2012, Rs. one trillion in deposits in 2015 and Rs. one trillion advances in 2016 as the first Sri Lankan bank to do so.
The Bank’s asset value now exceeds Rs. 1.6 trillion and is the highest asset base owned by a single business entity in the country. Currently the Bank of Ceylon is the only Sri Lankan bank to own ‘a trillion triplet’ in the balance sheet. With the current outlook on the bank’s asset growth rate at 7%, the Bank has planned to enhance its asset base up to Rs. 2 trillion by 2019 - yet another milestone in the Sri Lankan banking industry.
Such capabilities confer great responsibilities on the Bank of Ceylon to serve all stakeholders including its very diverse customer base from individuals to businesses and organizations from different geographic locations and economic strata.
The Bank’s approach to cater to the very dynamic banking needs of its customer base has been the key factor behind BOC brand’s 78-year-long success.
With the time-tested vision as ‘Banker to the Nation’, brand BOC has delivered the best results for its true stakeholders, citizens and the Government of Sri Lanka as a state-owned bank.
