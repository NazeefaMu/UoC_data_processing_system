Court orders CID to inform progress of investigation

Thajudeen murder case:
The Colombo Chief Magistrate’s Court yesterday ordered the CID to submit a further report in court on July 27 regarding the progress of the investigation into Wasim Thajudeen murder case.
When case came up before Colombo Additional Magistrate R.M.B.D.R.Weligodapitiya, two suspects former Western Province Senior DIG Anura Senanayake and former Narahenpita Crimes OIC Sumith Champika Perera were present in Courts.
They were arrested over their alleged role in the cover up of evidence in the former rugby player Wasim Thajudeen murder and conspiring to commit a murder.
They are currently out on bail.
On July 27, 2015 the CID submitted to Court that the death of Thajudeen was not an accident but a murder.
While delivering the verdict, Colombo Additional Magistrate Nishantha Peiris on February 25, 2016 ruled that the death appeared to be a murder and ordered the CID Director to immediately arrest all suspects involved in the incident and produce them before Courts.
Thajudeen was killed, apparently, in a road accident in Colombo in May 2012.
The CID had informed court that investigations conducted so far had revealed that Thajudeen’s teeth had been broken, the bones in the pelvic region also broken and his neck pierced with a sharp instrument prior to his death.
The CID added that muscles in his legs had been cut with a piece of a broken class. Earlier, Police maintained that Thajudeen was driving to the airport and had lost control of his car and crashed into the wall of Shalika Grounds at Park Road, Narahenpita, and that his vehicle had exploded within seconds of the crash.
