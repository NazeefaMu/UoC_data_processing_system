SA female cricketer does what 4064 international men cricketers couldn’t do

South African female cricket Chloe Tryon achieved an unprecedented feat during the first T20 against India at Senwes Park, Potchefstroom last Tuesday even though she could not end up on the winning side.
The 24-year-old South African played a scintillating innings of 32 runs in just seven deliveries at the fag end of their innings. During that six-minute inning, Tryon hit four sixes and two boundaries and could not score off just one delivery.
What makes the innings even more remarkable is the strike rate. Tryon’s runs came at a strike rate of 457.14 and if we talk of innings played of over 25 runs, Tryon’s strike rate is one of a kind in international cricket.
According to statistician Mohandas Menon, 4064 men have played international cricket till February 14, 2018 and none of those men have played an international innings with a strike as high as Tryon’s.
In 2007, Dwayne Smith hit 29 off nine deliveries in a T20 match against Bangladesh at a strike rate of 414.28. He had struck four sixes and a boundary in that innings.
Despite Tryon’s record-breaking innings, South Africa lost the match by seven wickets, thanks to Mithali Raj’s 54 not out.
Chasing 164/4, Mithali got good support from Veda Krishnamurthy (37 not out), Jemimah Rodriques (37) and opener Smriti Mandhana (28) as India overhauled the target with 1.1 overs and seven wickets to spare.
Mithali struck her 11th fifty in T20I cricket. Her unbeaten 54 came from 48 deliveries, out of which six went for fours and one went over the rope.
In the South African innings, captain Dane van Niekerk (38), Tryon (32 not out) and Mignon du Preez (31) contributed with crucial knocks. They were assisted by Nadine de Klerk (23 not out), Lizelle Lee (19) and Sune Luus (18).
For India, off-spinner Anuja Patil picked up two wickets, while medium pacers Shikha Pandey and Pooja Vastrakar got a wicket each.
Earlier, Jhulan Goswami had been ruled out of the five-match T20I series against South Africa due to a heel injury. – Indiatoday
