CR - Havies semi-final should be a close battle

CR and FC who secured a close 35-26 win at the hands of Army SC in their quarter final match last week will go all out to topple the Havelock's Sports Club in their Dialog inter club 'A' Division Clifford Cup knock out tournament semi final rugby match at Race Course at 4.15 pm today.
The lads from Longden Place went down to Havies by 34-18 and 26-21 in both the league tournament games played at Longden place and Havelock Park respectively. Hence another terrific tussle for supremacy can be expected today.
CR will miss the services of sturdily built hooker and rolling maul pilot Supun Warnakulasuriya, winger Anuradha Herath and flanker Dilanka Perera who are on the injured list. The Park Club will be sans fly half Dulaj Perera and second row forward Umesh Madushan who are also down with injuries. Flanker Shenal Deelaka who missed the last match due to injury makes a welcome return to the Havelock's team.
Havies who scored a hard fought 20-11 victory against Air Force SC in their quarter final match last week, will strive hard to pull this game through to getting to the all important finals as well and it won't be a surprise if they pull this game through to emerge victorious today.
