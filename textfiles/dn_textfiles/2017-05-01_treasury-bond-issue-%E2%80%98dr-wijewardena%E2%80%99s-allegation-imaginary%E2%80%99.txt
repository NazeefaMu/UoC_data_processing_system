Treasury Bond issue: ‘Dr. Wijewardena’s  allegation imaginary’

 
The allegation made by Dr. W.A. Wijewardena that a Rs. 10 billion loss has been incurred by the 30 year Treasury bond issuance on February 27, 2015 is but an imaginary one, the legal counsel to Perpetual Treasuries (Pvt,) Limited President's Counsel Nihal Fernando suggested.
Fernando PC made the suggestion when Dr. Wijewardena, a former Deputy Governor of the Central Bank, was testifying yesterday (28) before the Presidential Commission inquiring into the Treasury Bond issuance.
Fernando PC also suggested that this ‘imaginary loss calculation' of Dr. Wijewardena has mislead the first COPE subcommittee chaired by then MP D.E.W. Gunasekara.
He suggested that Dr. Wijewardena used indicative interest rates and market behaviour to make this calculation. Fernando PC said Dr. Wijewardena’s calculation has not considered as to what would follow after raising the government requirement nearing Rs. 10.5 billion in two year short tenure bonds. Dr. Wijewardena said he did indeed made the calculations based on assumptions and said he agrees with the initial recommendation given by the Public Debt Department to raise Rs. 2.6 billion using the auction method and the rest of Rs. 10.5 billion through direct placement method.
If one is calculating a loss, it should be done on net value, Fernando PC said. He asked whether Dr. Wijewardena is assuming that rest of the 10.5 billion would have been raised for the same rates.
Dr. Wijewardena said anybody can question his calculation, which is based on assumptions, but that he stands by his calculation since he believes he did his calculations based on the best assumption available in the market.
Fernando PC suggested that Dr. Wijewardena's calculation is done on worst assumptions available.
The Presidential Commission is to sit next Tuesday (2) again. JVP MP Wasantha Samarasinghe will be testifying before the Commission.
