Ven.Gnanasara withdraws FR petition

The Fundamental Rights petition filed by Bodu Bala Sena (BBS) General Secretary Ven.Galagoda Atte Gnanasara Thera seeking an Interim Order preventing Police from arresting him over several allegations was yesterday withdrawn before Supreme Court by the petitioner.
President’s Counsel Tirantha Walaliyadda appearing on behalf of Gnanasara Thera moved Court to withdraw the petition since his client has obtained bail.
Accordingly, the Supreme Court three-judge-bench comprising Chief Justice Priyasath Dep, Justice Upaly Abeyratne and Justice Vijith Malalgoda decided to performa dismiss the petition without any hearing.
Filing a Fundamental Rights petition through counsel, Gnanasara Thera sought an Interim Order preventing the Organized Crimes Prevention Division from arresting him until the investigations against him concluded and advice of the Attorney General is obtained in this regard. Gnanasara Thera has cited the OIC of Organized Crimes Prevention Division and three others as the respondents.
He further sought a declaration that the Fundamental Rights guaranteed under Article 12(1), 13(1) and 14(h) of the constitution have been violated by the respondents.
The petitioner stated that there is an island wide search for him to apprehend and arrest him and number of police teams have been deployed island wide for this purpose.
Gnanasara Thera had been released on bail on Wednesday (21) regarding two cases after being produced before the Colombo Chief Magistrate’s Court.
