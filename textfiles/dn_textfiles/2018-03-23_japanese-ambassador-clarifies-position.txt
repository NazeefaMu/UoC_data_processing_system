Japanese Ambassador clarifies position

The Japanese embassy in Colombo in a letter to the Daily News clarified the news item titled “Japanese envoy says no to foreign judges”, published in the Daily News of March 22.
The letter from the Japanese Embassy clarifying its position on the issue of foreign judges, says the above article has misinterpreted what Ambassador Suganuma told during the Q & A session after the signing ceremony of Grant Assistance for Grassroots Human Security Projects in Sri Lanka held on 21 March, 2018.
“Asked about the position of the Japanese Government on the issue of foreign judges, Ambassador Suganuma said that Japan is supporting the efforts of the Government of Sri Lanka for national reconciliation, including those for justice, and that it is ready to extend the assistance to these efforts if necessary.
Asked further on whether foreign judges are needed or not, Ambassador Suganuma replied that this has to be decided by the Government and people of Sri Lanka, and thus Japan is not in a position to say yes or no on the issue”.
We deeply regret any inconvenience this may have caused.
