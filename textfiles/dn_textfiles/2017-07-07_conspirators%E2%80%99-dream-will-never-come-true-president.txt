Conspirators’ dream will never come true: President

Those who stole the people’s money, made unlawful profits from state property and committed fraud, corruption and crimes when they were in power, are trying to convince the people that they can come to power again, President Maithripala Sirisena said.
“Those attempts which are based on ignoble political conspiracies will never become a reality. The government has implemented programmes to develop the country,” he said.
The President was speaking at the ceremony to hand over the deeds of Ranaviru houses, under the ‘Viru Sumithuru’ programme of the ‘Semata Sevana’ housing project on Wednesday.
The Viru Sumithuru programme was implemented under the directive of the President and the guidance of Defence State Minister Ruwan Wijeywardena to build 3,650 houses to solve the housing problems of the families of the War Heroes of the Tri-forces, Police and Civil Security Force who sacrificed their lives in the humanitarian operation.
One hundred and ninety two housing deeds were presented to the families of War Heroes.
President Sirisena said the country does not need political conspiracies, but moves forward as a country, building upon the victories achieved by War Heroes through their sacrifices for the independence and the sovereignty of the country.
“When the government is committed to building national unity and reconciliation through permanent peace, some opportunist politicians are trying to spread disunity,” he said.
“All Sri Lankans should get together to defeat those conspiracies,” he said.
He said some media institutions try to manipulate people’s opinion. “Those institutions are criticising the government that ended the era when journalists were killed, made to disappear and media stations that stood for media freedom were set on fire,” he said.
