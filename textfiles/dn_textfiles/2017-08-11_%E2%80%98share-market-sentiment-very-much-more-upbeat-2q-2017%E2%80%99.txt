quarter under review and the prospect of receiving the third tranche of the USD 1.5 billion International Monetary Fund’s (IMF) loan to Sri Lanka, he said.
The Central Bank of Sri Lanka held policy rates steady in the second quarter of 2017 after a 25 basis point hike in the first quarter. As such, the Standing Deposit Facility Rate (SDFR) and the Standing Lending Facility Rate (SLFR) as at June 30, 2017 was 7.25% and 8.75% respectively.

The transaction with an initial price guidance of 6.62% area was announced during the Asia morning of May 4th, 2017, and saw strong interests from a wide range of high quality investors, allowing Sri Lanka to tighten final price guidance to 6.250% area (+/-5 basis points).

USD 1.5 billion.
