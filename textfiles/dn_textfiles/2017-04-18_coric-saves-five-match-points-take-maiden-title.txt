Coric saves five match points to take maiden title

Marrakech: Croatia's Borna Coric saved five match points to defeat Germany's Philipp Kohlschreiber 5-7, 7-6 (7/3), 7-5 on Sunday to clinch his maiden career title at Marrakech.
Coric, the 20-year-old world number 79, trailed 3-0 in the second set and 4-2 in the decider before he rallied to victory against the third-seeded
Kohlschreiber, who was bidding for an eighth title.
The Croatian lost the 2016 Marrakech final to Federico Delbonis of Argentina.
Coric fired 10 aces to defeat Kohlschreiber after two hours and 38 minutes, the longest final on the ATP World Tour this year. AFP
