Metta, pillar of the Maithri Presidency

Did Maithripala Sirisena disappoint the 6.2 million voters by letting MR contest Parliamentary elections in August 2015 under the SLFP tag? Some called it a great betrayal; while others thought it a  emocratic option or burying the hatchet for mutual survival. The stakeholders of the great silent revolution of January 8; Civil society men, politicians, clergy and many independent groups who teamed up with a section of SLFP were expecting someone who believed in the famous Buddha word— the verse No. 5 in Dhammapada, ‘Nahiverena Verani—Sammanti dha Kudacancam…’
President Sirisena though born in Gampaha in the Western Province hails from Polonnaruwa in the North Central Province and is the first Head of State from that province. He who does not belong to the Sri Lankan political elite is an agriculturist.
Joining the mainstream politics in 1989 as a member of the Parliament he has held several ministerial portfolios since 1994. The General Secretary of the SLFP, he was Health Minister until November 2014 when he made that bold and surprise move announcing his candidacy for the 2015 presidency as the opposition’s “common candidate”. His victory too was generally viewed as a surprise. The 6.2 million votes were more anti-Rajapaksa than pro-Sirisena. Maithripala Sirisena pledged to reinforce Sri Lanka's judiciary and parliament, to battle with corruption and to investigate war crimes allegations without involving foreign judicial mechanism, repeal the notorious Eighteenth Amendment, bring back the Seventeenth Amendment and appoint Ranil Wickremesinghe, the UNP leader as Prime Minister.
At 6.20 p.m. on January 9, 2015, the 63-year-old farmer-turned-politician Maithripala Sirisena was sworn in as the sixth Executive President before a Supreme Court judge in Independence Square, Colombo. After being sworn in, Sirisena, unlike his predecessors, he pledged to voluntarily transfer significant presidential powers to Parliament.
The cultured man’s thinking he amply demonstrated twice within the first year itself as President; first when, in 2015, he not only criticised but called for the organisers of an Enrique Iglesias show in Colombo to be whipped. Commenting on the behaviour of a female fan he said, “I don't advocate that these uncivilised women who removed their brassieres should be beaten with toxic stingray tails, but those who organised such an event should be.”
Democratic option
The simple straightforward character, he requested the media and the people of Sri Lanka not to use His Excellency title although legally he was entitled to use the style, and also advised to avoid using the word First Lady for his wife, and requested only to use “President's wife”
Did Maithripala Sirisena disappoint the 6.2 million voters by letting MR contest Parliamentary elections in August 2015 under the SLFP tag? Some called it a great betrayal; while others thought it a democratic option or burying the hatchet for mutual survival. The stakeholders of the great silent revolution of January 8; Civil society men, politicians, clergy and many independent groups who teamed up with a section of SLFP were expecting someone who believed in the famous Buddha word— the verse No. 5 in Dhammapada, ‘Nahiverena Verani—Sammanti dha Kudacancam…’: [Hatred never ceases through hatred, but through love alone they cease] which he stated on the day he proclaimed his entry to the fray and repeated almost immediately after taking oaths to deprive Mahinda Rajapaksa of nominations to contest the scheduled Parliamentary elections.
The anti-Rajapaksa groups prompted vindictive response from the compassionate man reminding him of his fate, ‘six feet under…’, if his bête noire won on January 8, which he ignored while nominating his former boss to contest and lead the party at the Parliamentary Elections in mid-2015. He was targeted by the same group of people who supported him a few months before. All media, print and electronic -turned their wrath towards him. He was criticised and castigated a ‘traitor’ for a couple of weeks by the very people who laboured to crown him as the all-powerful Executive. In his own words, “They even put extra pressure on the pen, when writing the word traitor to scorn me.”
Making factual and authentic comments against the FCID, CID and the Bribery Commission, President Maithripala Sirisena once stated that certain persons, who had no understanding or capability to think on how to run the State, security, management of Defence Forces and administration make erroneous moves.
Leader of the SLFP
He showed what kind of a person he is when senior Minister and veteran politician, A.H.M. Fowzie, who has an unblemished record, was charged for using temporarily a car he used at his former office until he was given an official vehicle, while those who ransacked public property go scot free.
This incidence undermined Sirisena in his position as the leader of the SLFP and created a perception among the public that the three institutions are working to destabilise the President.
“I have stated clearly at a meeting with the Prime Minister and the Cabinet, that I will be forced to make certain hard decisions if the Bribery Commission, CID, FCID are functioning to please the political agendas of interested parties,” he said.
The President made this observation at the Sathviru Sanhinda organised by the Defence Ministry held at S L Foundation Institute. In another instance, during the latter part of last year, FCID summoned Vasantha Karannagoda, the naval officer who commanded the destruction of two LTTE vessels carrying a cache of arms long before the final thrust on the opponent and was also the Commander of Navy during the height of the final phase of the war. To be fair by the President, he even then reminded establishment on his role as the Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces, and that they must keep him informed every time such questioning demanded.
Questioning of Former Defence Secretary and Navy Commanders over the infamous floating armoury Avant Garde took place weeks ago but they were called upon before courts only a week ago. President strongly expressed his annoyance over, taking before the court, the four war heroes; he said:
“Independent Commissions were set up with a purpose and policy. Commissioners serving in them ought to know the functions relevant to them. There is an accepted procedure, as the President as well as the Minister of Defence, I need to know in advance. As per the Constitution, only the Executive has the power to appoint Secretaries and Directors-General.”
Numerous public officers had been brought to the FCID for questioning, a procedure that had generated a great deal of bitterness among government employees. When they tapped the telephone of SC Judge Gooneratne, who cleared Duminda Silva of the murder charges, the President appointed a committee to examine and report on the incident.
“I will not be submissive or under obligation to anybody. As the President I am bound to ensure the national security, to protect the tri-forces, give necessary facilities to them and protect their honour.” The President said that he would by no means allow the weakening of the Defence Forces: “If the intelligence officers now in remand custody have allegedly committed any offense they should be tried in courts, after getting them released on bail. If not ensure their early release. The suspects have their Fundamental Rights to secure bail and get their case be heard before the courts of law,” the President observed.
The President further stressed that he does not wish these establishments to be politicised.
May divine providence enable President Maithripala Sirisena to serve the full term of his Presidency.
