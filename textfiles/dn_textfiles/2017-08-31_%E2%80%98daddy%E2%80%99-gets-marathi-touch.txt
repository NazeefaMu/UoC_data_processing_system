‘Daddy’  gets a  Marathi  touch

Arjun Rampal’s biopic on Arun Gawli, titled ‘Daddy’, is touted to be among the most authentic gangster films to be made in Bollywood. The film aims to provide an intimate glimpse into the numerous chapters in the gangster-turned-politician’s life. Directed by Ashim Ahluwalia, the makers have gone to great lengths to make the film look, feel and sound as authentic as possible. Gawli spoke Marathi at home and had Maharastrian friends, thanks to his neighborhood in Parel and Dagdi Chawl where he actually stayed. Keeping that in mind, Arjun and Ashim roped in Marathi actors to play key roles which were a plus since they easily slipped into the skin of their characters. Anand Ingale, who plays Babu Reshim, made his debut in ‘Ajab Lagnachi Gajab Gosht’, and is known for his comic timing in the show, ‘Prapancha’. Rajesh Shringarpure, who plays Rama Naik, has worked in several Marathi films, too. Nishikant Kamat, a celebrated actor and filmmaker, plays officer Vijaykar Nitin, who had a pivotal role in the gangster’s life. Aazun kahi pahije ka?
Daddy, presented by Wave Cinemas’ Ponty Chadha, Raju Chadha, Karta Entertainment and Kundalini Entertainment, releases on September 8, 2017.
