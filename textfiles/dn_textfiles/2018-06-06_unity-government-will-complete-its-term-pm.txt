Unity Government will complete its term - PM

The Unity Government will complete its term, said Prime Minister Ranil Wickremsinghe yesterday as he stressed that they needed to continue in order to fulfil the promises made.
He acknowledged that there were certain issues that needed to be resolved but in the interest of the people, the current administration would function until August 2020.
The Prime Minister was addressing a gathering at his annual Ifthar held at Temple Trees.
“We will work together with all constituents of the national government and people with all races and religions,” the PM said.
Speaking on the communal unrest which took place in February and March in Kandy and Ampara which destroyed many Muslim businesses, the Prime Minister assured that they had undertaken and completed investigations into 100 suspects involved in the incidents.
He reassured those gathered that all of them would be dealt with under the law.
