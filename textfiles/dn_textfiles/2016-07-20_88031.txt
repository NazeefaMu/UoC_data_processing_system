One-day tri-series in England: Thumping eight-wicket win for Pakistan A

 
CHELTENHAM: Pakistan A romped to an eight-wicket win against Sri Lanka A in the opening game of the one-day triangular series, also involving England Lions, in Cheltenham on Monday.
Pakistan A’s bowlers backed Babar Azam’s decision to field as Sri Lanka A were dismantled for 199 in 37.5 overs. In reply, Fakhar Zaman (74) and Sharjeel Khan (90), their openers, shared a 155-run stand that helped Pakistan cruise. They eventually sealed the win with 97 balls to spare.
Pakistan’s bowlers hunted in packs, but it was Mohammad Asghar, the left-arm spinner, who inflicted the bulk of the damage, taking 4 for 41 in 10 overs.
Asghar, introduced in the 14th over with Sri Lanka A reduced to 94 for 3 after a blazing start, struck in consecutive overs to remove Bhanuka Rajapaksa and Ashan Priyanjan, the captain. Angelo Perera then resisted with 35, but there was little contribution of note otherwise.
Abbas, the right-arm pacer, took three wickets, but was expensive and leaked 50 runs in seven overs. Bhatti took 2 for 40 in eight overs, while left-arm spinner Mohammad Nawaz took the last wicket to fall - Lakshan Sandakan.
Any hopes Sri Lanka’s bowlers may have had of picking early wickets and bouncing back were emphatically shattered by Zaman and Sharjeel, who kept them at bay for 23.1 overs, scoring at well over a run-a-ball. Zaman hit seven fours and three sixes in his 77-ball knock, while Sharjeel was equally aggressive by striking at 121.62 courtesy 12 fours and four sixes.
Both batsmen were dismissed in the space of 25 deliveries by Kasun Rajitha, the right-arm medium pacer, but Umar Siddiq and Abdul Rehman Muzammil made sure to avoid further losses.
Sri Lanka A : 199 in 37.5 overs (D de Silva 27, B Rajapaksa 29, A Perera 35, Mohammad Abbas 3/50, Bilawal Bhatti 2/40, Mohammad Asghar 4/41)
Pakistan A : 200-2 in 33.5 overs (Fakhar Zaman 74, Sharjeel Khan 90, Umar Siddiq 20 n.o., K Rajitha 2/42)
