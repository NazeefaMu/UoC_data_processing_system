Court judgement copies made free

Cabinet on Wednesday approved a proposal to issue a copy of the judgement to each party in a court case free.
Currently a certified copy of the judgement can only obtained for a fee. The Justice Ministry has observed that many cannot afford this fee and undergo many difficulties when obtaining a copy of the judgement.
Justice Minister Dr Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe submitted this Cabinet paper to amend the Civil Procedure Code and the Criminal Procedure Code to make provisions to issue a certified copy of the judgement to each party free.
