NEW ALLIANCE TO BE REGISTERED - PM

Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe yesterday said, the United National Front (UNF) will form a broad national alliance, which will be called and registered as ‘the National Democratic Front’ without delay. “It will be set up aiming to protect the motherland and democracy, he said.
“The resolution related to it will be presented to the United National Party Working Committee this Friday for approval,” the Prime Minister said.
The Prime Minister was speaking at the UNF’s “Victory of Justice” rally held Galle Face Green last evening.
Hundreds and thousands of UNF supporters from all across the country gathered at the rally.
UNF MPs said that the rally recorded the highest number of people to have gathered at a political rally in its history.
The Prime Minister said the UNF has to face two major elections in the future and called on the masses to give it a two-thirds majority at a forthcoming General Election. Wickremesinghe promised that he will see to the abolition of the Executive Presidency.
“Through that we would also remove the laws contradictory to the Constitution, strengthen the Legislative, the Court and Fundamental Rights”.
He said the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna and they voted for the 19th Amendment together.
“It clearly states that it requires a two-thirds majority to dissolve Parliament before four and half years. We extracted it from the UK Parliament Act,” he added.
“Now they are blaming the court.But, the country’s judicial system became independent due to the 19th Amendment to the Constitution, moved by us and thereby could protect the people’s sovereignty.”
Saying that the Rajapaksa faction was repeating the need of a General Election, the Prime Minister questioned as to why did they not present any resolution to Parliament to dissolve Parliament without taking over the government. “This was a coup. But, now we are going to ask from the every political party, when they needed an election. We cannot protect the Constitution by violating it,” Prime Minister Wickremesinghe added.
“Now they are talking about racism. However, 90 per cent of the people are for democracy. We need democracy despite religious, race, or any division. We, in this country need reconciliation. We need a political solution. We would present this political solution based on a Unitary State. We would not shy away from it,” the PM stressed.
He said, as the new government, they would go ahead by rectifying their faults and shortcomings. According to him, the ministers and the MPs would build up very close relationships with their supporters. We will also expedite the implementation of the law to bring the offenders to justice.
“We will also create a civilized society and provide a good future for our young generation. You can point out our shortcomings. I am not angry with the social media. As youth, that is the society you want.
Speaking to the massive crowd, the Prime Minister said this is the Janabalaya (People’s Power). Nobody can stop this. You were my strength during the past historical 52 days. I am grateful to all for the support extended to protect democracy.
“The Rajapaksas tried to disrupt Parliament. They prevented the Speaker from taking his Chair “The converted democracy into the chili powder,” the Premier said. However, we could face that crisis as we set up a strong Parliament and protected the Fundamental Rights.
