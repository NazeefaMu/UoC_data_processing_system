Peace builders unite

In Commonwealth member states, Poppy Day is observed on an annual basis every November, in remembrance of those who died in the line of duty during the first World War. This year saw the commemoration of 100 years since the end of the war, and many special events were held to mark this anniversary.
One such event took place earlier this year at the Peace Village in Mesen, Belgium. As 2018 marked a century after the end of World War 1, the Peace Village in Belgium set up a new project - '18 in 18'. The aim of this project was to bring together young people from each of the countries that had been involved in the conflict during the Great War. Each country would nominate a girl and a boy who turned 18 in 2018. These young people would gather at the Peace Village and work towards creating a contemporary message of peace.
Sri Lanka Unites was approached to help find participants from Sri Lanka, and based on the organizations long term partnership with Elizabeth Moir School, two students Ramudi Samarasekera and Rithesh Sathyanandan were nominated to attend the event.
The participants worked together to create a contemporary peace message, which was then presented and distributed to policy makers from Flanders, Belgium, the European Union, the United Nations and ambassadors from the participating nations.
“The contemporary peace message contained 14 statements. They focused on multiple issues such as the improvement of justice systems, effective cooperation, reconciliation and remembrance. We formed the message combining ideas from all the participants. During the final ceremony we presented our peace messages using multiple forms of art, which included theatre, dance, film, practical art and food” explained Rithesh.
The students went on several visits linked to the Great War, including the Peace to the World workshops and lectures, and spent a great deal of time in fellowship with other participants. Ramudi says, “Meeting people from multiple nations showed us how they haddifferent ideas and opinions.
It exposed us to more ideas and different cultures. It taught us how people should respect other people’s opinions and listen to their ideas. We saw first hand how cooperative and helpful people were even though we were from different countries, especially when we were working on our art projects. I think it’s safe to say that both Rithesh and I have made life long friends even though we spent seven days togethe
