Get rid of coins
It is astonishing to observe that when figures appear in quotations, annual reports etc they are stated up to the cents column. This is not material at all. At present Rs 1 has no value and even beggars do not accept charity if it is less than Rs 10. This is a fact. Further the cents column makes the figure column lengthy and also distorts the figure appearing in the report.
It will be better to state figures to the nearest rupee or even thousand rupees with proper notes and explanation at the top. For example instead of quoting 26,616,846.80 (as appeared in a recent quotation) it should have been stated as Rs 26,616.847 or to the nearest thousand. Figures more than a million could be stated to the nearest thousand. Blindly following procedure serves no purpose. Information should be in precise form for better presentation. Auditors should note this and advise the clients accordingly. Bills and invoices also could be raised to the nearest rupee so that cash settlement is easy.
All coins up to Rs 1 may be withdrawn by the Central Bank from public circulation with due notice. Necessary legislation should be passed. Cash boxes can then accommodate more coins of higher denomination. This may be applied to Rs 2 and 5 coins later if necessary.
