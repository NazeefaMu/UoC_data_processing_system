Korean Film Festival from October 14 to 17

The Korean Embassy and the Korea Foundation will co-host the Korean Film Festival 2016 from October 14 to 17 at the National Film Corporation (NFC) Theatre, Colombo 7, in partnership with the National Film Corporation. The opening ceremony will take place at 7 pm on the first day of the festival (October 14), and Born to Sing, a comedy drama, is scheduled to be screened as the opening film.
The festival hopes to provide Sri Lankan people with an opportunity to better understand Korea’s culture and society through the medium of contemporary films. In total, four contemporary Korean films will be featured during the festival for the public on a first-come first-served basis. All movies will have English subtitles. The films to be screened are Born to Sing (Comedy Drama 2013), How to Steal a Dog (Family Drama 2014), No Breathing (Romance 2013), and My Love, My Bride (Comedy 2014).
Korean films have enjoyed soaring popularity over the last few years. Korean movies are both character- and plot-driven, and incredibly diverse and complex with a healthy mix of blockbusters, documentaries, indie films and film festival movies, while offering an alternative to the usual ‘Western’ scripts. The new Korean films of the 21st century, a regular feature at international film festivals, are playing a crucial trend-shaping role in Asian culture in particular. The high calibre Korean films today are largely the result of the artistic passion of Korean movie makers and their ability to match the production skills of other advanced nations as well as Korean moviegoers undying support for Korean films.
