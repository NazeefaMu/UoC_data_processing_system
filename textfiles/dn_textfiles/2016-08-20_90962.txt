Plans to bring UNP supporters for SLFP Convention: MR

Plans are underway to bring UNP supporters to the 65th Convention of the Sri Lanka Freedom Party to be held in Kurunegala on September 4 to show that the people are still with the SLFP leadership, former President Mahinda Rajapaksa said.
The former President said the removal of electoral organisers is aimed at the voters of the party and not the electoral organisers.
“This is an attempt to take revenge from the people who voted for the SLFP’s victory,” he said.
Rajapaksa said that appointing a group of people who are less popular among the people and who are supportive of the UNP will help ruin the party.
“I have not made any decision about participating in this convention.
I will take a decision after consulting Joint Opposition Parliamentarians and Local Government representatives,”he said.
Meanwhile, Kandy district parliamentarian Dilum Amunugama yesterday said that all Joint Opposition Parliamentarians will join in the party’s 65th Convention, if SLFP Parliamentarians are ready to vacate their portfolios in the present government.
“We are not in a position to participate in this convention, if SLFP Parliamentarians holding various portfolios in the government are not prepared to vacate their portfolios forthwith,”he said.
Addressing a press conference in Kandy, Amunugama said that attempts to bring JO Parliamentarians to the convention is futile, when members of the Joint Opposition are being targeted by the government.
Amunugama said the SLFP is removing its electoral organisers who are more popular in their districts on the recommendation of United National Party.
