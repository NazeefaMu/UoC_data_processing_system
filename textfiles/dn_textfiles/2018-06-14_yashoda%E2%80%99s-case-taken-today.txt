Yashoda’s case taken today

Yashoda Range Bandara who has been arrested and remanded in connection with a motor accident was ordered to be re-remanded till June 13 by the Chilaw Magistrate Court on June 12.
Yashoda Range Bandara who is the son of State Minister Palitha Range Bandara is warded at the Sri Jayawardenepura hospital and receiving treatment under guard by prison officers. Since Prison officials failed to produce him in the Chilaw Magistrate's Court yesterday, the Case was postponed till June 14 by the Magistrate who ordered Prison officers to produce him in Court on June 14.
The accident occurred when a double cab driven by Yashoda Range Bandara ran off the road at Kottapitiya Junction Bangadeniya on the Chilaw – Puttalam road and crashed into a house causing heavy damage to the cab and the house. The accident occurred when a group of people were returning in the cab after attending a party in a hotel in Karukepane on June 6.
Two people injured including Range Bandara were admitted to the Chilaw hospital and later Range Bandara was transferred to the Colombo General Hospital and Range Bandara was later admitted to the Sri Jayawardenepura hospital.
State Minister Palitha Range Bandara when contacted said his son Yashoda Range Bandara was the Media Secretary to his Ministry and he had the right to drive the double cab belonging to his Ministry. The group had visited the hotel that day to attend an official meeting. Palitha Range Bandara said certain sections of the media were trying to blow the incident out of proportion in order to hide their own sins and omissions.
Palitha Range Bandara was in the Court Complex to attend another case heard in the Chilaw High Court. He was not in the Magistrate's Court when his son's case came up for hearing.
