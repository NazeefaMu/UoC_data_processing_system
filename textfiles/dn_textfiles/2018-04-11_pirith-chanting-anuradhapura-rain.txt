Pirith chanting in  Anuradhapura for rain

A pirith chanting ceremony will be held at the Anuradhapura Jaya Sri Maha Boodhi to evoke blessings of the Triple Gems and the deities for adequate rain in Rajarata.
Agriculture Minister Daminda Dissanayake said President Maithiripala Sirisena has instructed him to organise the meritorious act under the advice of incumbents of the Atamasthana headed by Atamasthanadhipathi Ven. Dr. Pallegama Siriniwasa Nayaka Thera.
The Minister said dry food ration bags valued at Rs. 5,000 each were distributed to 137,000 affected families and sediment in 250 tanks are removed at a cost of Rs. 1,500 million.
"An insurance scheme was effected for the Yala season 2018 and Rs. 40,000 is paid per acre for a full crops failure. Farmers do not have to subscribe to join the scheme. Earlier, only a Rs. 10,000 compensation was paid and farmers had to subscribe to get it," the Minister said.
Minister Duminda said the farmers would receive compensation up to Rs. 40,000 per acre for crop damages caused by the wild elephants under the scheme.
"Around 20,000 affected farmers during 2017/18 Maha season in the Anuradhapura district have appealed for compensation, and they were granted Rs. 40,000 per acre. Rs. 650 million was allocated for the purpose. Compensation would be granted batch by batch," the Minister said.
