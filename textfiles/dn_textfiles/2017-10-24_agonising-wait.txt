The agonising wait

Nine years since the end of the war, many promises and false starts, Meena, a 56 year old grandmother, is still waiting for a solid roof, four proper walls and a cement floor to replace the zinc sheets of the makeshift shelter that she and her extended family had occupied since 2011. That was the year in which, the government gave her back the land, where a four room, 2,000 square foot gallant house once stood, in a village close to Killinochchi.
“My late husband’s father built that house. Our children were born there,” Meena told a visitor last week, while waiting to hear of a new, innovative, mud and cement brick house that may eventually be given by World Vision and Habitat for Humanity, two non-governmental organisations, who plan to deliver 750 homes to families like Meena´s, scattered around the Killinochchi district.
According to the Ministry of Prison Reforms, Rehabilitation, Resettlement and Hindu Religious Affairs, which is tasked with re-housing families who have lost their homes during the war, more than 70,000 families are still waiting for a solid roof to shelter them, nine years after the war ended.
“The people have been waiting for a long time. Most of them lost their homes long before the war ended, but despite the government promising that houses will be built, there hasn't been much progress,” a former government official, who preferred anonymity, told Daily News.
Houses not viable
It is in this backdrop that Sunday Observer wrote last week that a request for proposal (RFP) issued by the Ministry of National Integration and Reconciliation for 50,000 houses for war displaced families in the North and the East is causing concern to community groups and technical experts who are questioning the viability of the project.

This request for proposal is the second avatar of a controversial plan by the government to provide these much needed housing to the war displaced. In the first attempt, made in 2015 by the Ministry of Prison Reforms, Rehabilitation, Resettlement, and Hindu Religious Affairs, the government sought to build 65,000 low cost housing units. However, that plan and the tender was scuttled when community groups and technical experts raised issues about the winning bid, a flat-packed Chinese built light steel and aluminium structure, marketed under the Protea brand name of Arcelor Mittal, a steel and mining giant headquartered out of Luxembourg, a European tax-haven.
Arcelor Mittal first priced one house at approximately Rs. 2.25 million rupees, but later adjusted the pricing to approximately Rs. 1.5 million by deleting a package of furniture and electrical goods. Community groups and others were quick to point out that similar flat packed units can be sourced directly from China for less than US$3,000 or approximately Rs 450,000 at the prevailing exchange rate at that time.
A report compiled by engineers Prof. Priyan Dias, Prof. Rangika Halwatura, and Architect Varuna de Silva of the University of Katubedda was to state that “when compared to the block wall houses, the steel houses suffer from several key drawbacks including inadequate foundations, insufficient roof support, risk of steel corrosion despite the coatings provided, poor ventilation, poor or non-existent capacity for extension or repair, much shorter lifespan, unlikely to create a sense of ownership, very unlikely to foster the local economy and generate employment.”
They suggested that “the way forward is to construct block wall houses, while finding ways to overcome any disadvantages they may have, for example, finding new sources of natural resources; alternative technologies to reduce natural resource usage; arranging financing”.
Following this report and extensive lobbying by community groups and legal challenges mounted by the Tamil National Alliance, the government sought to partially cancel the tender and re-bid for 50,000 houses.
The new RFP, according to sources, is based on the recommendations made in the technical report made by the Katubedda University team, but has gone beyond the remit of low-cost housing by specifying material and accessories that will push the basic cost beyond Rs 1.9 million, twice the cost of a housing unit that community groups proposed to the government, based on community labour participation and funding by a consortium of local banks.
Re-tender brings in new issues
Prof. Rangika Halwatura, a member of the team that compiled the technical report, told Daily News last week that although the government’s decision to move from the previous tender is commendable, the current tender specifications too raise concerns.

“They have specified the construction material as well as the plan that is something that I was taken back with. When you restrict the scope and specify the material and plans, the fact of innovation will not come into the picture.”
According to Prof. Halwatura, the best option would have been to give a minimum standard ‘but not into every minute detailing’.
He further pointed out concerns over environmental pollution that can be caused by excessive Calicut tiles and brick production to cater to a larger demand and the soil excavation it requires will draw in an imbalance.
“Timber is the most sustainable material in the world for construction. However, our timber manufacturers are not in the habit of replanting. So specifying timber as a construction material while knowing there are many other innovative and cost effective alternatives is a disaster,” Prof. Halwatura said.
He further suggested that if arrangements can be made to make the specification open, then people could suggest the options and the technical evaluation team can go through all these innovative ideas and select the best. “This is about the sustainability of the project and final achievement as a country.”
The tender has attempted to mitigate some of the issues that arose from the previous tender by breaking the bid down to 100 “packages” of 500 houses each, to make it possible for a smaller scale contractor to take part in the bid. However, it then imposes bid conditions that only large-scale contractors can match – a 400 million annual construction turnover for the past five-years, totalling Rs. Two Billion per 500 house package and a Rs. three million bid bond per package. Successful bidders must also provide 100 percent financing with a term sheet to be provided by a bank or financing institute with interest on a “soft” loan basis and extended repayment periods. “Preferably, the repayment period shall be not less than fifteen (15) years including the grace period. The grace period shall be not less than two (02) years. Preference will be given to extended grace period repayment period and interest rate from a national perspective,” the RFP states.
“Only a handful of local construction firms will be able to satisfy these conditions, even for a single package of 500 houses each. If you bid for more than a single package, for example, two packages for one thousand houses, your bid condition of 400 million annual construction turnover becomes 800 million and the five-year total becomes four billion rupees. There are no more than five local contractors who can satisfy these conditions if it’s more than two packages,” an industry source told Daily News.
Maintaining Quality
Dr. (Eng.) S. S. Sivakumar, head of Civil Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, University of Jaffna, told Daily News that while the foremost point to bear in mind is immediate need of the people, “in spite of that the urgency the quality must be maintained as well.”
“We have problems in getting material and labour in the Northern region. These were some of the main factors that led to the proposal to build pre-fabricated houses. If the finances are immediately available, the houses can be constructed within a budget of Rs. 1 million or 1.2 million. For about 500 – 550 square feet with two rooms, kitchen, and an outside bathroom. If the finances are not available, the contractor has to come with a finance package that will cause accumulation of compound interest, which in turn will increase the cost to about Rs. 1.8 – 1.9 million per house, Dr. Sivakumar said.
He echoed Prof. Halwatura stating that another aspect that should be revisited in the current RFP is the requirement of sand and clay blocks, Calicut tiles and timber frames. “Supplies for such a vast quantity of timber, Calicut roof tiles and river sand for the construction of fifty thousand houses is not that easy,” Dr. Sivakumar said.
Another requirement is that the walls should be constructed to a thickness of 9 inches when a wall with a thickness of 4 to 4.5 inches would be sufficient. These are factors that should be re considered and will affect in reducing the building cost, according to Dr. Sivakumar.
“Getting good quality Calicut tiles in such a vast quantity is an impossible task. It is therefore better to go for aluminium roofing with steel frame. Window and door frames too can be done using aluminium and not timber, which is a better option. Oxidised aluminium can be used in these weather conditions. We can also opt for UPC doors and windows.”
When the Daily News contacted the Secretary to the Ministry of National Integration and Reconciliation V. Sivagnanasothy, he was of the opinion that the bidders will have to comply with some requirements, but mostly are broader specifications.
“Very broad specifications are given and employers and bidders are given the opportunity to bid accordingly, but within the said parameters of five hundred square foot area two bedroom houses. You cannot have flexibility in that because one cannot have three bedrooms and another two. Those generally set parameters are already in place, and other than that we have not been very rigid as such. But it has to be within a model which accommodates good socially acceptable models,” the Secretary said.
Dr. Sivakumar and Prof. Halwatura, both professionals in the engineering field are of a different opinion about the hard coding of the specifications in the RFP. Their opinions belie Sivagnanasothy´s statement that the RFP is not rigid.
