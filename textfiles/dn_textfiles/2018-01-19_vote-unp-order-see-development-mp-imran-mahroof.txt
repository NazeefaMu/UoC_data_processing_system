Vote for UNP in order to see development - MP Imran Mahroof

United National Party Parliamentarian Imran Mahroof said that those who cannot light up the electric lights in the Kinniya Bridge again ask for power. He said this while speaking at a public meeting on Wednesday night (17), supporting candidates for the UNP in Kinniya Pradeshiya Sabha.
He said, twenty years later, the United National Party has come to power. That is why we are slowly leading to the development of the country. This is why it is interesting to raise questions about what the United National Party has developed for the minority parties in the government.
“The last time the local councils were with them, and they also held many ministries in Parliament. Yet they could not even light up the panels on the Kinniya Bridge. Those who do not even have the power to light up a Bridge have come under your power to be elected to come back to power.
For Trincomalee I am the only MP who represents the United National Party. There is no MP or member of local government. So now let us show these powers by voting for the UNP, the ruling party, to show everyone what it means to develop.
Today, Ministers who criticise our state were ministers of the Mahinda Government. Yet, they did not carry out development they claim today.
Everyone should realise that Ranil Wickremesinghe’s government is needed to keep their ministry’s work running properly and develop” Mahroof said.
