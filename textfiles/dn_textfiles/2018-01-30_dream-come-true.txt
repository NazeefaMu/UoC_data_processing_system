Dream come true

President Maithiripala Sirisena called on seven-year-old Amani Raida at her residence in Badulla yesterday, following an invitation extended by the young girl when she visited him at the Presidential Secretariat on an earlier occasion. President Sirisena, after participating in a rally held at Badulla, visited the girl’s house despite an extremely busy schedule. Raida warmly welcomed the President and sang a song for him as well.Picture by Sandaruwan Amarasinghe - President’s Media Division
