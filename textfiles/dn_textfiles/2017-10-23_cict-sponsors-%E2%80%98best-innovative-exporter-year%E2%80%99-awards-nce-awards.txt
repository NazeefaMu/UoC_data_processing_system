Commenting on the sponsorship of this award, CICT’s Head of Marketing and Commercial, Catriona Jayasundera said,“Being a vital link in the logistics chain, CICT believes that supporting the export community or the export trade is not only our responsibility but is something we must strive to do. It is with this view that we supported the NCE for this prestigious event. We believe that it is through innovation that efficiency and diversity are born. This is something that is central to our work and is why we specifically chose this award category.”
