CID to probe 20-year-old Korean cold case

The CID has commenced investigations into a gang rape incident that had taken place in Korea 20 years ago. In 1998, an 18-year-old Korean girl had died in a traffic accident on the Guma expressway in the Thegu area in the Korean Republic.
The Korean Police and other investigators had found the girl's underwear in another location from where she had been killed in an accident. The authorities having found sperm on her clothes had conducted DNA tests on the sperm samples but they were unable to match the DNA to anyone at the time. Subsequently, the authorities had safely stored the DNA samples.
Meanwhile, 12 years later in 2010, another Sri Lankan who had gone to Korea on employment was found guilty by the Thegu Court for inviting an under aged girl for sex for money. Generally, in Korea they obtain DNA samples of offenders and store them and compare them with DNA samples of unidentified cases. In this case the Korean authorities had compared the DNA of the convicted suspect with the DNA that was found on the undergarments of the accident victim in 1998. In 2011 the Korean authorities revealed that the DNA of the convicted Sri Lankan matched the stored samples from the accident victim’s clothes.
The accident victim’s father had constantly been pressuring the Korean authorities to press charges against the Sri Lankan man but according to Korean law, rape charges could not be filed after 10 years of the incident. Accordingly, the Thegu Courts rejected the case. Two other Sri Lankans who were allegedly involved in this gang rape of the accident victim had by this time, returned to Sri Lanka.
The Korean authorities had notified the Sri Lankan government through diplomatic channels about this incident on August 28, 2017 and on may 30, 2018, a Korean team arrived in the country and met with the Attorney General, CID and Justice Ministry Officials.
The Attorney General had issued instructions to the CID to conduct investigations in this regard and a team of CID officers had gone to Korea for this purpose. The CID team had recorded statements at the Sri Lankan Embassy in Korea and had subsequently visited the site of the incident.
"The CID had established that all three suspects involved in this gang rape are in Sri Lanka and they had presented information to the Colombo Fort Magistrate’s Court yesterday(October 1). This is the first time that the law is being enacted according to the provisions of Sri Lanka," Police Spokesman SP Ruwan Gunasekara said.
