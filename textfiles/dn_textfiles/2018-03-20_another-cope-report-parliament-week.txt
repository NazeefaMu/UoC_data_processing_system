Another COPE report in Parliament this week

The Committee on Public Enterprises (COPE) will present another report in Parliament this week containing details of 13 public institutions that came under its scrutiny.
COPE Chairman Sunil Hadunnetti told the Daily News that the report would be tabled on Wednesday. This will be the fifth COPE report presented in the eighth Parliament which commenced sittings from September 2015.
The last COPE report presented in the House in October last year contained details of 15 public enterprises that came under its probe. The Chairman also stressed the need to take follow up action on the previous reports the Committee produced.
The Chairman said the Sri Lanka Foreign Employment Bureau is among the 13 institutions included in the latest report.
