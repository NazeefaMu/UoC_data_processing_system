Boy ‘lays egg’

In a bizarre incident that has left doctors baffled, a teenage boy named Akmal laid an egg in front of them after he was brought to the hospital writhing in pain. The 14-year-old Akmal’s family from Gowa, Indonesia, claimed that he has laid 20 eggs in the last two years, according to reports in Mirror.
However, the doctors are not ready to believe the family’s claim and said it is impossible for poultry eggs to develop inside a human and suspect that eggs were possibly put inside the boy’s rectum. The family has refuted the allegations saying that the proof is Akmal’s X-ray which shows an egg inside his body.
The boy’s father Rusli was quoted as saying, “In the last two years he laid 18 eggs and 2 today, so in total there have been 20. I cracked the first egg and its content was all yellow, no white.” The father added, “A month later I cracked another one, and its content was all white and no yellow.”
Suggesting that the story is made up, a hospital spokesman said, “Our suspicion is that the eggs were deliberately shoved into Akmal’s rectum. But we did not see it directly.”
Akmal is in quarantine at the Syekh Yusuf Hospital in Gowa and doctors have placed him under observation. Express
