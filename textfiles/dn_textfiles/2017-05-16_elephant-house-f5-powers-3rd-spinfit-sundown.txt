Elephant House F5 powers 3rd Spinfit Sundown

Elephant House F5 is excited to continue in its role as “Beverage Partner” for Spinfit Sundown, an increasingly popular running and cycling event now in its third edition. This is also the second time F5 has signed on to support this important and open-to-all fitness activity, which is popularising running and cycling for the entire family, enabling them to receive untold benefits from a healthier lifestyle.
Featuring more than 400 contestants, competing in over 20 races, Spinfit Sundown is organised by Spinner Cafe that offers something for every age group, with categories encompassing kids to seniors at all levels.
Elephant House F5 also continues to be very active at all Spinfit Sundown events, offering participants the chance to sample the refreshing F5 range. Competitors and spectators at Spinfit Sundown events also stand the opportunity to win gifts by taking part in the “F5 Fitness Challenge”, which has proven time and again to be popular amongst all age groups.
Ceylon Cold Stores PLC Head of Beverages/John Keells Holdings Vice President Daminda Gamlath said, “We are pleased to continue this exciting partnership between Elephant House F5 and Spinfit Sundown. It is important to note that a cornerstone of F5 as a brand is its dedication to promoting an active and healthy lifestyle amongst all Sri Lankans. So this partnership also serves to help us contribute to our nation’s continued good health, a vital part of F5’s commitment to its loyal fans.”
Due to increased popularity, Spinfit Sundown will be organised as a quarterly event in the future.
