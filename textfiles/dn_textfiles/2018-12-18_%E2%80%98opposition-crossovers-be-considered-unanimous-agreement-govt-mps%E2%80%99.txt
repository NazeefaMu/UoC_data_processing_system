‘Opposition crossovers to be considered on unanimous agreement of Govt. MPs’

A unanimous agreement from all the government MPs will be considered before accepting Opposition members who are willing to cross over, UNP MP Nalin Bandara Jayamaha yesterday said.
“A group of 20 Opposition MPs requested to cross over. However, at yesterday’s group meeting, some of these persons were vehemently rejected by our MPs. We have been told that the opinion of all our MPs would be considered when allowing the crossovers. We will interview these persons before we take them in,” MP Bandara said.
MP Bandara was speaking at a press briefing at Temple Trees yesterday morning, along with UNP MPs Mujibur Rahman and J.C. Alawathuwala.
MP Alawathuwala said young UNP Parliamentarians have a big say in keeping the government in check and on track.
The UNP MPs also said the Cabinet would be sworn in today (18).
The UNP MPs said there are no clashes within the United National Front regarding Cabinet portfolios.
“Our MPs are ready to sacrifice their portfolios to keep the Cabinet at a minimum of 30. If we are to maintain a Cabinet of 35 ministers, we will have to seek the approval of Parliament, they said.
The MPs were also critical of President Maithripala Sirisena’s recent speech. They said Sirisena had no legitimate reason to sack Wickremesinge from his post or appoint Mahinda Rajapaksa of all people. It was Sirisena who said that Rajapaksa was ready to send him six foot below the ground,” they said.
MP Mujibur Rahman said President Sirisena betrayed 6.2 million people who voted for the yahapalana government.
“The President complains about many things. But, are we not hurt by his actions? It was the UNP voters who made way for him to become the President of this country. They risked their families when supporting him. Then, he went and gave the PM post to Rajapaksa. Should we not get angry about it? Should we not complain?” he questioned.
“The only complaint against Ranil Wickremesinghe is the Treasury Bond issue. The people responsible for this issue are still in prison. A Presidential Commission of Inquiry investigated the matter. The accounts of Perpetual Treasuries Pvt. Ltd. are frozen. If President thinks that Wickremesinghe is responsible for this issue, he can file a case against him. But what about Mahinda Rajapaksa? The Presidential Commission of Inquiry into Serious Acts of Fraud and Corruption has made Rajapaksa responsible. How can President Sirisena appoint such a person to the MP post?” Rahman questioned.
Meanwhile, MP Bandara said the government sector had come to a standstill due to the recent political crisis. However, many government servants have acted prudently under trying circumstances. “There have been several discrepancies with regards to tenders and agreements. We have received all these details. We will soon commence investigations into them,” Bandara also said.
Asked if the Cabinet will include MPs who have corruption allegations such as MP Ravi Karunanayake and MP Malik Samarawickrama, the UNP MPs said that neither of those has yet been made culprits of any corruption.
On the Singapore-Sri Lanka trade agreement, MP Nalin Bandara said that they are ready to discuss any adjustments proposed by the Expert Committee appointed by the President. He also said an investment worth US$ 1 billion for an iron factory in Trincomalee is to begin as part of this trade agreement.
“If someone says that the trade agreement should be cancelled, they are brainless,” Bandara said.
