Wayamba Councillors take to bullock cart

A campaign launched by members of the UPFA administered Wayamba Provincial Council joined with the Joint Opposition to protest against the current fuel shortage by travelling in bullock carts to attend the Council meeting yesterday, frittered out as only five members opted to come in the bullock cart to the Council meeting.
All other minsters and council members ignored their clarion call and travelled in their official cars to attend the council meeting yesterday.
The five members who came to the meeting in a bullock cart were Piyumal Herath, Sumith Rajapaksa, D.B. Herath, Samanpriya Herath and Ashoka Premadasa.
They too tried a mere publicity stunt by boarding the bullock cart about 200 metres away from the Provincial Council Complex after parking their official vehicles near the Kurunegala Wath-himi Bandara Devalaya premises.
