MCA 'F' Div. 25-Over League cricket: MAS Kreeda create history by allowing  three disabled players

At the completion of the League Stage matches (75 half day matches), the following top 16 teams from the 05 groups advanced to the elimination round: Brandix Essentials 'B', WNS Global & Technomedics International from Group 'A'; Janashakthi Insurance, Stafford Motors, Palliyaguruge Group and Hirdaramani Group from Group 'B' ; HSBC 'C', Hayleys Group 'C' and Totalamber from Group 'C'; Allianz Insurance, Textured Jersey 'B' and Access Group from Group 'D'; Akbar Bros., Asia Capital, Prym Intimates and Teejay Lanka from Group 'E'.
The Week-end’s top performers were: Dinesh Tharaka from Textured Jersey 'B' (102 not out in 56 balls, inclusive of 03 sixes and 12 fours Vs. Fairway Holdings); Dilshan Indrasinghe from HSBC 'C' (4.4 - 14 - 5 Vs. Totalamber ); Harsha de Silva from Palliyaguruge Group (90 in 58 balls, 02 sixes / 12 fours Vs. MAS Linea Aqua); the 112 runs partnership for the 3rd wicket in 69 balls between Kavinda de Silva (67) and Roshan Mahawatte from Access Group Vs. MBSL Insurance and the 101 runs partnership for the 2nd wicket in 74 balls between F. Ahamed (67) and S. Amunugama 55 not out from EB Creasey Vs. Ansell Textiles.
MAS Kreeda created MCA history when they declared 03 differently able players (deaf and dumb) in their team declaration.
This put the Match Referee, Pemlal Fernando and the Umpires, A.D. Indunil and Viraj Nishantha in a quandary. Out of the 03 players 02 were substitutes.
The player who played, bowled a couple of overs and when appealing he put his hands up in the air and waited for the umpire’s response.
