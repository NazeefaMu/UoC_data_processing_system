It was risky to make ‘Beyond the Clouds’ in India

Oscar-nominated Iranian director Majid Majidi who has made his latest movie “Beyond the Clouds” in India has said that it was very risky for him to make the movie in the country.
“I had proposals from several Indian producers to make a film in their country, but I viewed them as highly risky since I knew very little about Indian culture,” Majidi said during a workshop organized at the 36th Fajr International Film Festival on Saturday.
“I feel a strong affinity between Indian and Iranian cultures but I had to increase my knowledge of the Indian culture in order to make my film’s story believable,” he added.
He said he hired all members of his cast and crew except his assistant from India. “The Bollywood cinema has its unique rules and we must follow their rules if we want our film to do very well at the box office,” he added.
According to Majid, exterior scenes in many Indian films are shot at large studios that they have. However, he chose to film the exterior scenes of his movie outdoors in Mumbai.
He described Mumbai as a very crowded city where horns are blaring constantly. “I wanted to make my film in a real place consequently shooting lasted for over seven months on location in the heart of Mumbai,” he said.
Starring Ishaan Khattar, Malavika Mohanan and Sharada, “Beyond the Clouds” tells the story a young boy, Amir, and his sister, Tara, in Mumbai.
