Japan facilitates fishermen in Sampur

Ambassador of Japan in Sri Lanka Kenichi Suganuma handed over eight new fishing boats, engines, fishing nets and cooler boxes to the Sampur Fishermens’ Society on August 21 to fulfill a much needed requirement for livelihood development.
Muthur Divisional Secretary Vellakutty Yoosuff, Sevalanka Foundation Chairman Dr. Harsha Kumara Navaratne, other NGO staffs and the members of the Sampur Fishermens’ Society were present at the occassion.
The Project for the Economic and Social integration of the IDP returnees in Trincomalee District is being implemented in Sampur, Trincomalee District, supporting the rapid resettlement in the area.
The project is implemented by Sevalanka Foundation with the Japanese Government ODA grant aid of US$93,022 (approx. Rs. 13.5 million) under the Grant Assistance for Grassroots Human Security Project (GGP), for the improvement of livelihoods and education environment of the returnees. It will benefit 189 members of the Fishermens’ Society not only through the provision of fishing gear but also by the construction of a fishermens’ facility and renovation of roads.
About 60 preschool children will also be provided an improved preschool education facility to enhance early education environment.
With the provisions through the collaborative efforts of the Japanese Government and the Sevalanka Foundation, the people of Sampur will see a better future for their children and their livelihood options to move on the resettlement process.
