Pakistan - Sri Lanka ‘Green Cricket Match’ for climate change awareness

Pakistani Climate Change Federal Minister Senator Mushahidullah Khan mooted the idea of organizing ‘Green Climate Matches’ between the teams of Pakistan and Sri Lanka for public awareness on climate change, during a meeting with City Planning and Water Supply Minister Rauff Hakeem, recently.
The bilateral meeting was held on the sidelines of the Seventh South Asian Conference on Sanitation, in Islamabad. Over 700 international and national delegates from eight South Asian countries attended the conference.
The Pakistani Minister said the two countries should collaborate to advance their common interests at international forums on climate change issues. He said the ‘Green Climate Matches’ between the two teams would help to create awareness, as cricket is popular in both countries.
Minister Hakeem appreciated the idea of organizing ‘Green Matches’ between Sri Lankan and Pakistani cricket teams to create public awareness and agreed to speak to the Sri Lanka cricket board about organizing such matches. He spoke of extending the concept to include India as well.
He also spoke about the recent natural disasters, including floods in Pakistan due to climatic change. He said he would like to learn from Pakistan’s expertise with regard to disaster management.
Minister Hakeem discussed opportunities for mutual cooperation on water, sanitation and climate change.
The Pakistani Federal Minister for Climate Change briefed Minister Hakeem on the overall work of the Pakistani Climate Change Ministry and said they have a separate ministry working on water issues as well. He added that Pakistan has made remarkable achievements in water conservation. New dams are built to save water from melting glaciers. Bhasha and Dasu Dams are two significant ones.
The Pakistani Federal Minister also spoke about China’s system for effective water management. He added that Pakistan and Sri Lanka are countries with the least contribution to global carbon emissions but are facing many negative impacts of climate change.
Minister Hakeem also proposed the signing of a MoU between the two countries for mutual cooperation in the areas of environment and climate change.
