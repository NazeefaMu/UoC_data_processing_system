Wrestling-themed giant  burger needs  a tag team

When you're part of a wrestling tag team, you have to be able to rely on your partner. After all, they'll need to be ready to dive in when you're flagging on the ropes, aggressively yell words of encouragement when you're caught in a headlock, and distract the ref while you sneak in a few illegal low blows against your opponent.
But what better test of a tag team could there be than pairing up to take on the challenge of a giant plate of food?
Enter the Be Like No One burger, a doubly dense delicacy created by video game publisher 2K in collaboration with restaurant chain The Diner to mark the release of WWE 2K18 , the latest wrestling title in the long running sports entertainment franchise.
On one side, there are two 5oz beef patties, a slice of American cheese and burger sauce. Next to all that - in the same massive figure-of-eight brioche bun - are two buttermilk fried chicken breasts, Monterey Jack cheese, streaky bacon and coleslaw.
The whole thing is topped off with four onion rings. The Sun
