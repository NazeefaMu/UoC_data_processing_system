Hospital sans dentist

The Udadumbara Regional Hospital runs without a dentist since the beginning of this year. This has adversely affected patients who come for treatments in the Udadumbara area, said District Medical Officer Kalum Jayawardhana of the Udadumbara Regional Hospital. The previous dentist who worked in the hospital was released for his higher studies. Jayawardhana said the clinic is fully equipped with all medical equipment and the only problem is that the hospital is running without a doctor.
A large number of patients who come for different kinds of dental ailments especially pregnant mothers have to go to Teldeniya District Base Hospital for treatment. The doctor said the hospital has decided to establish a mobile dental clinic in the hospital every Wednesday at the beginning of the month and he has informed to higher authorities asking for a doctor for the hospital.
