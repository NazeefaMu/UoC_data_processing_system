Charlemagne wins Sports Ministry Cup

An action packed Saturday morning kicked off with the inauguration of the newly built Saddling Enclosure at the Royal Turf Club (RTC) in Little England - yet another achievement in improving the infrastructure of the RTC.
It would be a race against time to see if the card of 6 races followed by an auction sale of Thoroughbreds would go through without the rain playing spoilsport.
It was a perfect day for horseracing in Nuwara Eliya where some really competitive racing backed by superb entertainment showcased.
The first Race of the afternoon, The Victoria Turf Club Cup saw Stormy Petrel (Burden of Proof ex Stormy Affair) storm out of the gates and after that there was no looking back. The mare sported the colours of Anjali Stables and she was trained by SV Madialingam and ridden by A. Vishwanath.
The Sugathadasa Stadium Cup had excitement even before the start thanks to a colt named Stockwell who did a houdini act by getting out of the gates after being stalled and then bolting. He was subsequently withdrawn and it was left to Don Hasa (Strength to Succeed ex Fleet Footed) from the Selvaratnam stable who won effortlessly from end to end. The Sports Ministry Challenge Cup came up next and it was easy picking for Charlemagne who gave the Anjali Stables of Owner James Matthew a super double. The Sports Minister Dayasiri Jayasekara gave away the trophy to the winner.
And then came the icing on the cake as the minister joined the band to regale the appreciative crowd with some awesome singing. The crowd wouldn't let him go and he happily obliged with an encore.
The RTC Auction Sale Trophy was up next and considering the first ever Auction Sale of Thoroughbreds involved 15 Indian horses it should have been a pointer.
Indian Epic was the choice and he did it in style to become the fourth winner in succession to win from start to finish.
Owned by Isira Dassanayake, Indian Epic was trained by SD Lalith and ridden by C Umesh.
The RTC Nuwara Eliya Cup for Sri Lankan breds was won effortlessly by Airborne II and then in the last race the RTC Winners Trophy which was also for Sti Lankan breds, City Shot bounced to the front and never looked back to win easy.
A great day of racing. Punctuated with some super entertainment and fashion.
