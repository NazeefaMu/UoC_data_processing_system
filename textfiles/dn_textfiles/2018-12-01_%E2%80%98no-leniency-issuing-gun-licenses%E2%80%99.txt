‘No leniency in issuing gun licenses’

Farmers visit me at my office often to get their firearm application forms recommended, which is practically and legally impossible, said Anuradhapura government agent R. M. Wanninayake.
He was speaking at the November Anuradhapura District Agriculture Committee Session.
He informed farmer organisations and officials that people were acting on wrong information that temporary gun licenses were issued by the District Secretariat for the protection of cultivations.
There is no such leniency in issuing gun licenses on the part of the government, he said.
“Government agents have proposed authorities to relax laws on firearms.”
