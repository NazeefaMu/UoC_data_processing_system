MR was engaged in political deals - Dilan

Highways State Minister Dilan Perera said that former President Mahinda Rajapaksa was engaged in political deals.
Perera said so responding to a journalist, who raised a question regarding the allegation of Parliamentarian Namal Rajapaksa that the government is engaged in political deals.
He said that 'deals' are not new in the country's political arena.
He noted that Namal's father - former President Rajapaksa was also engaged in a deal aiming to come to power in 2005. As a result of that deal people of the North and East refrained from voting and therefore, he (Rajapaksa) could become the President. If there was no such deal Prabhakaran would have been alive today.
He revealed that Namal Rajapaksa was also engaged in a political deal very recently to bring back Foreign Minister Mangala Samaraweera to the Sri Lanka Freedom Party.
"It was Namal who talked with Minister Samaraweera aiming to coax him to crossover to the SLFP," Perera said.
