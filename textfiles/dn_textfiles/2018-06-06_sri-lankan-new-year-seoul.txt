The New Year event included the playing of traditional Avurudu games including children’s games, a cricket match, selection of Avurudu Kumara and AvuruduKumari. The event was sponsored by Bank of Ceylon, Indian Ocean Pvt. and several well-wishers. The full-day event was a great success. The traditional New Year is celebrated when the sun moves from Meena Rashiya (House of Pisces) to Mesha Rashiya (House of Aries) and marks the end of the harvesting season.
