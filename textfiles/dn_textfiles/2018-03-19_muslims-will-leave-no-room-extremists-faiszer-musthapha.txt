Muslims will leave no room for extremists: Faiszer Musthapha

Muslims in Sri Lanka will not leave room for operation of extremist organisations as our Muslims have always been living in unity and harmony with the Sinhalese and other communities although such organisations infiltrate various countries to spawn terrorism by distorting the minds of Muslim inhabitants, Local Government and Provincial Councils Minister. Faiszer Musthapha said.
He called on the Most. Ven. Tibbotuwawe Sri Siddhartha Sumangala Mahanayake Thera of the Malwatte Chapter at the Malwatte Viharaya in Kandy yesterday and received his blessings.
Musthapha said that even though some people subscribing to excrement views were found among Sinhalese, Muslims and Tamils, Muslims as a whole had never clamoured for a separate state or region in Sri Lanka. Minister Mustapha said those behind the Kandy incident were trying to create enmity between Sinhala and Muslim Communities.
A major dialogue among a collective or religious dignitaries, politicians and civil altruists should take place to erase certain misconceptions among the people, he said.
Minister Musthapha said the Kandy Meeramakkam Mosque was on a land belonging to the Sri Dalada Maligawa.
He said it symbolised the unity and harmony existing among the Sinhala Buddhists and Muslims in the country from ancient times.
"The Kandy incidents had blotted the long-standing unity and harmony among Sinhalese and Muslims to a small extent.
Since Facebook was used to instigate hate between the two communities, the government had to block social media websites for a limited period," the Minister said.
The Malwatte prelate in his anusasana said segregation of schools as Sinhala and Muslim schools led to problems as in Kandy.
The Thera said that ifcombined schools were crated for Sinhala, Muslim and other children, it would help forge communal unity.
The Nayaka Thera said Muslim traders in Ridigama belied their identity as they spoke Sinhala fluently in conducting business. The Prelate emphasised that he never condoned clashes of this nature and added that the Kandy incident was the climax of an issue burning for sometime.
The Thera said religious freedom should be ensured to all communities in the country.
