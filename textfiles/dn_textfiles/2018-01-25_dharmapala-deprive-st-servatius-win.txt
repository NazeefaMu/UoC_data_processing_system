Dharmapala deprive St Servatius of a win

Dhilshan de Silva and Dulaj Egodage batted out 24 overs to help Dharmapala College deprive St Servatius College of an outright win at Uyanwatta yesterday. Dharmapala given a target of 170 were 107/6 at close of play.
Dharmapala continuing from their overnight score of 42/1 just managed to avert the follow on by a run by Shashika Dulshan, Supun Kavinda and Keshara Nuwantha sharing the wickets. Opener Malith Sandakelum topped the score card with 33. Dharmapala bowlers did well to restrain Servatius batsmen forcing them to declare their innings at 70/8 giving Dharmapala a reachable victory target of 170. The Dharmapala
batsmen were never in contention losing wickets regularly and were six down for 81 when Dhilshan de Silva and Dulaj Egodage batted out 24 overs to save them from an outright defeat.
