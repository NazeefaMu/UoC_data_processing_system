Alleged plot to kill Maldives President by Sri Lankan

The Ministry of Justice through Police has sought Colombo Chief Magistrate Court’s permission to record a statement from a Sri Lankan in connection with an alleged plot to assassinate the incumbent Maldives President Abdulla Yameen in 2015.
The Ministry of Justice had made a request from Colombo Chief Magistrate that the Colombo Crimes Division be granted permission to record a statement from Yassari Danushka Perera regarding the incident.
The Ministry of Justice in Sri Lanka had decided to initiate a magisterial inquiry into the incident following a request by the government of Maldives in terms of section 10 (1) of the Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters Act No.25 of 2002.
When the case came up before Colombo Chief Magistrate Lal Ranasinghe Bandara, the counsel who appeared on behalf of Yassari Danushka Perera told court that his client was not present in Court since he is currently receiving treatment at a private hospital in Colombo. President Abdulla Yameen narrowly escaped injury when a blast struck the boat he was using to return home from the airport on October 20, 2015.
The Vice-President of Maldives, Ahmed Adeeb had been arrested in connection with the alleged plot to assassinate the President.
