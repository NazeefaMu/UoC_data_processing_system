Speaking at the launch, Bangladesh Cricket Board president, Nazmul Hassan Papon, stated that “the support and contribution of Sri Lanka [and India] in Bangladesh's cricketing journey could not be overemphasized, and this invitation was a clear testament to what a good friend Sri Lanka has been to Bangladesh's Cricket. This tournament too, would no doubt continue to strengthen the bonds between the 3 nations.”
BCCI CEO, Rahul Johri said, “We are privileged to be a part of Sri Lanka’s 70th year celebrations, there is no closer friend to the BCCI than Sri Lanka [and Bangladesh] and when Mr. Sumathipala first floated this invitation, there was almost instant agreement that the Indian team would participate for this reason.”
