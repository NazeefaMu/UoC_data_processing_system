200,000 tourists to Sri Lanka from France by 2020: Jean-Marin Schuh

Ambassador of France to Sri Lanka and the Maldives Jean-Marin Schuh lauded Sri Lanka for its efforts to promote tourism and establish itself as a must-visit destination for French people and said about 100,000 from France visited Sri Lanka in 2010 and over 200,000 will arrive by 2020.
He was addressing a news conference hosted by the Alliance Francaise de Kotte in Colombo yesterday to introduce its new director, Francis Cappe, and to outline how it will expand its activities to teach more Sri Lankans the French language and familiarise them with French culture
“Sri Lanka has entered the tourism age, as two million visitors came last year. There were only 30,000 visitors from France in 2010. .
Because of this increase in French travelers, Sri Lanka will need more French-speaking guides in the coming years. The Alliance Francaise de Kotte currently teaches French to about 2,000 Sri Lankans each year. About 10,000 are learning the language in schools and universities, he said.
The Ambassador also explained that those who study French at the Alliance Francaise put themselves in prime position to pursue further study in France.
“France wants to receive more Sri Lankan students. French universities are subsidised by the government and are very cheap, which makes them attractive to foreigners,” he said, while adding that there are currently roughly 200 students who are either Sri Lankan or of Sri Lankan origin studying in French universities.
Schuh highlighted that the Government of France does not recognise the Alliance Francaise de Colombo on Barnes Place, due to an internal dispute.
The Alliance Francaise opened in Sri Lanka in 1954 and has branches in Galle, Matara, Kandy, Jaffna, and Colombo.
