Pujara benefitting by county experience - Pothas

 KOLKATA, Friday - The man carrying India’s hopes of a decent first innings total Cheteswar Pujara was praised for his determined and dogged resistance in trying conditions by Sri Lanka head coach Nic Pothas who attributed it to his experience of playing English county cricket.
“Pujara he is a world class player. That innings shows the benefit of him playing county cricket. That is definitely a wicket you find in April and May and he played the conditions well,” said Pothas at the end of another rain ruined second day of the first Test.
While all the Indian top order batsmen had struggled to come to terms with the overcast conditions and the grassy Eden Gardens pitch prepared for the match, Pujara alone stood tall mounting a one-man resistance against the marauding Lankan seaming attack headed by Suranga Lakmal.
After two days India has stumbled to 74-5 with Pujara making the major contribution to the total with an determined unbeaten 47 off 103 balls.
“The game is not that old and we have only finished two days of play. Where we stand at the moment we are very happy but we are not getting too comfortable as it is a high quality Indian team,” said Pothas.
“So far we are pleased how things have gone for us. It will be very challenging batting conditions. You have got to still go out there and do the job.”
Speaking on the Lankan seam attack Pothas said, “The attack is different as these guys were mostly injured when we played India at home.
Secondly, they are seam bowler friendly conditions. Of course you can attribute the success to the conditions as that’s the fact of matter. As I said, the conditions are provided and you need to play in them. Pujara has played really well.”
“Lakmal is a very intelligent bowler. He does lots of research. He knows how to control his workload.
He is very astute and knows when he is prepared. That’s the mark of any international bowler. He has improved immeasurably,” said Pothas.
“If you are playing international cricket, you have to always improve as others are improving. Otherwise you are not going to make any progress.”
