Justice Ministry to launch  public awareness programme

The level of awareness about the country’s law implementation system will be increased by the Justice Ministry among police officers, grama niladaris, adults committee members and public officers. The Legal Aid Commission will carry out the task, Justice Ministry sources said.
The Legal Aid Commission of Sri Lanka was set up on July 7, 1978 by the Legal Aid Act No. 27 of 1978. Only five legal aid centres function in Colombo, Galle, Anuradhapura, Kurunegala and Kandy. The Colombo Head Office reportedly has 82 legal aid centres. The number will be increased and the commissions staff include a chairman, director general, nine commissioners, consultant and a secretary.
The commission receives Rs. 200 million annually to meet its additional expenses.
A Judicial Ministry Spokesman told Daily News that during 2017 January to December, 141,264 persons including litigants were offered legal assistance by the commission.
