The Nice Guys : Amazing yet overlooked

Ryan Gosling and Russell Crowe reinvigorate this genre blending it with the best of the buddy comedy to make something truly unique. But the Nice Guys failed to rake at the box office. They more than made up for in great reviews. Gosling and Crowe carry the film with their rapport lending itself to quick-witted dialogue surprisingly hilarious physical comedy plus screenwriter and director Shane Black also wrote “Lethal Weapon”. The Quintessential buddy cop comedy. Breathing a new life into a retired genre the Nice Guys submits itself as a classic of days to come.
Ryan Gosling and Russell Crowe and is a story of two private detectives who are looking for a girl called named Amelia who is some wired way involved with a death of a porn star with some other several deaths being involved and it’s 1977. Basically the movie is these two unconventional characters getting to know each other.
Russell Crowe plays a tough guy and he’s the kind of guy you hire maybe to beat somebody up who’s following you. He’s not actually a private detective but sort of wishes he was. He fancies Himself a P.I. (Holland March) Ryan Gosling’s character actually is. The funny thing is Russell Crowe’s character (Jackson Healy) is probably better at his job even though he’s not officially licensed.
I was super excited for this movie because Shane Black has written a very small amount of films and although I didn’t love Iron Man 3. I enjoyed it. You can tell that Shane Black definitely understands where he’s at home, writing buddy cop movies because the Nice Guys was probably one of my favourite movies of 2016. This is a fresh offbeat unconventional original witty comedy with two actors at the top their game. Their chemistry in this movie work like magic and not just because they’re funny play off each other well but also these characters feel at home with each other and yes that is a classic buddy-cop genre thing. What sort of reactions people had when you pair Chris Tucker and Jackie Chan. Oddly strange. When you pair Mel Gibson and Danny Glover? Those people are two different opposing people. The difference here with these characters is that they’re not actually opposing. They’re both have troubled pasts. They both have issues with alcohol. They’re very similar in a lot of ways. They don’t highly contract one another. It’s the fact that they work together so well as a comedy team playing off each other that’s so fresh and original.
The action is also great in this movie. Really great shootouts old 1980 style action film-making despite the fact that it takes place in the 70’s that I must mention is perfectly well realized. I felt like I was watching a movie that came out in the 70’s, but with better film stock. It’s “The Nice Guys” is a perfect recapturing of a setting the mystery is appealing. So authentic this felt like the type of movie that wouldn’t come out today like it’s just past it’s time. Hollywood doesn’t make like these anymore. They rely on special effects, more explosions, more CGI but this movie is that type of movie that offers something great that would remind you why you love movies so much similar to “Kiss Kiss Bang Bang” There is also a fantastical vibe towards the final reel I couldn’t get enough of it’s good characters, good dialogue, good story and great direction The Nice Guys is probably is one the best movie I’ve seen last year.
The Nice Guys is a Lethal Weapon for a new generation.
