Airtel enriches customer experience  with new app, extended services

Airtel Lanka introduced a series of additional tools and services to its growing customer base across Sri Lanka, in its continued effort to give the best experience to Airtel subscribers. Recently, Airtel launched the ‘My Airtel’ app, a comprehensive solution that allows subscribers to access a wide range of Airtel products and services through their smartphones and receive App only exclusive offers.
Available for Android, Apple and Windows smartphones, the ‘My Airtel’ app allows subscribers to see their available and outstanding balance through an easy to navigate dashboard, pay or top up their account, activate packs and get array/bouquet of entertainment services.
Bharti Airtel Lanka CEO/ MD Jinesh Hedge commenting on the company’s continued drive to enhance customer experience said, “Brilliant customer care is when our customers are empowered to facilitate themselves without the need of reaching out to the call centre. As we expand, we need to simplify our subscribers’ interaction with us and enable them to take control of their account from anywhere, at any time.”
A live chat platform was also launched, allowing customers to interact with Airtel Sales, Customer Service, and Technical Support agents through airtel.lk, ‘My Airtel’ app and on the ‘Airtel life’ Facebook Page & Messenger. The chat platform will provide customers with an ‘anywhere-anytime’ access to support with their package, technical support or any other inquiry related to their Airtel connection.
Further enhancing the subscriber experience, customers can now obtain services and support from over 13,000 outlets spread across Sri Lanka. The Airtel outlets are specifically geared to offer premier services such as mobile data services, reloads and recharges, SIM registration and replacements, and bill payments.
