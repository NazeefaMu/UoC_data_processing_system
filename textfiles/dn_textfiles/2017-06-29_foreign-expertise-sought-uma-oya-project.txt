Foreign expertise sought on Uma Oya project

 
President Maithripala Sirisena said today that advice from foreign experts will be sought to proceed with the Uma Oya project.
He said this while addressing a gathering in Nuwera-Eliya today.  
Residents in Bandarawela staged a protest yesterday against the construction of the 26 km long tunnel from Uma Oya, alleging that water levels in streams and wells in the area have dropped due to the construction and the stability of more than 7,000 houses have also been affected.
In response to these allegations, Cabinet Co-Spokesperson Minister Dhayasiri Jayasekara said that the Uma Oya project was started without following proper criteria by the previous regime.
Furthermore he said that Sri Lanka has taken a large volume of loans from Iran for this project.
He said that the government cannot give up on this project even though it is problematic to continue with it.
Jayasekara also pointed out the adverse environmental conditions have arised mainly due to the machines employed for the project.
However a Ministerial subcommittee comprising of Ministers Mahinda Amaraweera, Patali Champika Ranawaka and Vijit Vijayamuni Zoysa was appointed yesterday to look into the issues raised from the Uma Oya project.
