McOcean Property Developers (Pvt) Ltd., a member of the McLarens Group in a Joint Venture with Peak Engineering and Consultancy (Pte) Ltd., of Singapore, launched McPeak Lanka (Private) Limited; a company that offers Integrated Facilities Management Solutions to the local market.
McPeak Lanka intends to provide Integrated Facilities Management Solutions to a broad spectrum of the public and private sector institutions in the country. The company will offer a comprehensive range of cutting-edge solutions to those who seek to upgrade and sustain high-quality services capabilities of their organizations. McPeak Lanka will deliver an authentic integrated model of services through a seamless integration of people, processes and systems to suit the customized needs and requirements of clients in Commercial, Industrial, Retail or even in Mixed Development settings.
McPeak Lanka will hone in on over two decades of local experience in property and hospitality management of the McLarens Group with the innovation, professionalism, and service excellence in the effective management of residential, commercial, retail and industrial properties that is offered by Peak Engineering and Consultancy of Singapore.
The new company provides highly trained engineering, security and janitorial cadres backed by well experienced managerial staff to ensure continuous & efficient service delivery.
Addressing launch ceremony, Trevor Reckerman, Director of McPeak Lanka stated, “that with an ever-expanding skyline and more sophisticated vertical spaces, the need for high quality maintenance becomes a dire necessity. No more will ad-hoc patchwork remedies fit the scale of expensive and expansive property development whether it be public or private sector institutions. We believe that the time has come for professional services in Integrated Facility Management Solutions that will give you our clients, Peace of Mind”
Expressing his views, Francis Chua – Founder and Managing Director of Peak Consultancy stated, “We are very proud and confident indeed to extend our services to Sri Lanka that we see is growing rapidly, evidenced by the fast development of infrastructure and modern facilities.”
McPeak Lanka and its parent organizations are extremely keen to create a strong performance differentiator in the local market that goes beyond just depending on reputation alone! Most facility management services in the country are fragmented and reliant on multiple vendors who more often than not cannot sustain a high level of service. McPeak Lanka intends to overcome this hurdle by providing specialized training and psychological support to all its cadres in order to improve their interactive capability and delivery challenges.
Furthermore, McPeak Lanka will emphasize the best sustainability practices in the business to ensure that its people and systems conform to the highest standards.
Thus, the intent in providing holistic solutions is uppermost in our minds, the Commercial Head of McPeak Lanka, Amiyu Kumudun, stated.
