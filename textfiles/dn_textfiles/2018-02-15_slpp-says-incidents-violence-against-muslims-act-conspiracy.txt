Muslim Council calls for calm, never meant to go public:
SLPP says incidents of violence against Muslims, act of conspiracy

Prof. G.L.Peiris responding to allegations ofattacks on Muslim-owned properties orchestrated by Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) members said that such incidents should reported to the police and that the perpetrators were in the government.
Last week, the Muslim Council of Sri Lanka headed by N.M.Ameen in a letter addressed to Prof. G.L.Peiris, cited that some of SLPP cadres were suspected of causing violence against some Muslims in Uguraspitiya in Kandy, Veyangalle in Agalawatte and kalutara on the assumption that Muslims in these areas did not support the SLPP.
“We never released the letter to the media nor did we want to go public with it, our intention in sending a letter to Prof. Peiris was to bring this to his notice since we feared that these incidents may spread,” Muslim Council President N.M.Ameen told the Daily News. “We even brought this to the notice of Basil Rajapaksa who assured us he would look into the matter.”
