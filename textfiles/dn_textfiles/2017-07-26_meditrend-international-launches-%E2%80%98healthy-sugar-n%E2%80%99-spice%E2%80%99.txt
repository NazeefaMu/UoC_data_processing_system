Meditrend International launches ‘Healthy Sugar N’ Spice’

Understanding these trends, Meditrend International was formed in Australia by two Sri Lankans who saw a growing need for products that promote healthy living. With a vision to offer new and innovative medical technologies to the world through their Australian business, Trevor Ekanayake and Melville Shanmugaratnam also identified a need for dietary supplements and all-natural food supplements in Sri Lanka.
Thereafter under the watchful eye of Tania and Gamini de Silva based in Colombo, Meditrend’s fully-owned subsidiary Meditrend International Lanka Private Ltd was formed.
The first products to be launched by the local arm of the company are world-renowned Nirvana Stevia and Himalayan Salts.
The product launch was held at Colombo’s favourite healthy food restaurant EAT RIGHT. Simone Friemann from Nirvana Australia was the visiting Guest of Honour, while the event was also attended by renowned nutritionists, dieticians, chefs from the hotel sector, health and fitness instructors, personal trainers, health-conscious celebrities and members of the media.
Manufactured and packed in Australia, Nirvana Organic Products have been in the market for more than 14 years and is Australian Certified Organically (ACO) grown.
Nirvana Stevia is also free of fat, wheat, yeast, soy, milk derivatives, gluten, synthetic additives and has no chemical preservatives making it a natural and practical alternative.
For those who prefer their salt to sugar, Meditrend also introduced a range of Himalayan Salts to the local consumer.
Guests at the launch were treated to a special menu using Nirvana Stevia and
Both products will be available at the Eat Right restaurant at Dutugemunu Street, Kohuwela, selected health food stores and pharmacies islandwide.
