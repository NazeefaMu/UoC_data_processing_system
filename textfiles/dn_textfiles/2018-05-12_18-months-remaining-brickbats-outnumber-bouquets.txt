With 18 months remaining: Brickbats outnumber bouquets

Three years into trying out “Consensual Governance”, the President plainly admitted that the contemporary Sri Lankan politics lack the socio-political maturity required to move forward with a national government system.
“The consensual and dialogue democracy is the governing structure of most of the democratic countries in the world today, but it is still an alien concept for us,” said the President taking a frank look back.
True, the disillusionment associated with this statement started creeping in long before, but comparing this statement with the President’s very own words on September 1, 2015, shows the huge chasm between now and then.
“It is my belief that the new parliament that commences today will mark an important landmark in the history of Sri Lankan politics…We have seen in various countries, faced with national challenges, the main political parties come together with consensus to form alliance governments, casting aside their political differences…This Parliament is setting up a government of consensus for two years to fulfil that national requirement (of speedy socio-economic development)…I trust that it will be a start of a new developed political culture of this country,” said President Maithripala Sirisena in his first Policy Statement opening the First Session of Eighth Parliament.
Still fresh in memory are his words that resonated with the line of thinking of citizenry giving high hopes for a new political culture of building consensus and ceasing political rivalry. Addressing the same set of MPs while being in the Speaker’s Chair, the President then said, “I am committed to create a new political culture with political leaders with good values, good personality, a good image as well as discipline. These are the qualities an exemplary political leader must have.”
Three years down the line, what can be construed is that every step forward has been matched with two steps back. The never-ending power struggle in the Government, between Government and Opposition and within political parties has been a stumbling block to the country’s progress, especially in the last three years, and it continues to be.
Clock is spinning fast
President Maithripala Sirisena, with less than 18 months left to show real progress in turning his words into action and delivering the hitherto unkept promises that propelled him into the highest office, called for unity of all for the sake of country.
“It must be noted that the country is not in a situation where it is appropriate for different parties and groups to test their political power, but in a situation where the challenges faced by the nation should be overcome with a collective effort… It is the people who become desperate by all forms of conflicts over power,” the President said formerly opening the Second Session of Eighth Parliament.
The ceremonial sitting and the President’s Policy Statement on Tuesday were meant to infuse new vigour to the Government giving hopes for a fresh start. Prorogation of Parliament just before the traditional New Year was a sudden and rather unexpected move by the President, but it was an opportunity for Government to get back on track and speed-up its journey.
The business of first week of new session was encouraging in this light. Two long-awaited pieces of legislation on the anti-corruption front namely the Judicature Amendment Bill and National Audit Bill were on the table this week. Another two amendment Bills to empower the Bribery Commission to file cases based on facts revealed by Presidential Commissions of Inquiry were also presented for the first reading.
Better late than never
Among them, the Government could ensure the safe passage of the Judicature Amendment Bill on Wednesday to provide for the setting up of a permanent High Court to expedite the cases of large scale corruption and financial crimes. The idea of a special court to speed-up the high profile cases strongly came up after the last Presidential Polls, but it did not proceed as the Constitution did not provide for such a move. Setting up separate courts was proposed as an alternative and it took three long years to realize. Despite diminishing hopes and full of scepticism people still welcomed the move as it is better late than never.
The Bill was passed with Amendments receiving 119 votes for and 52 against following a division called by Joint Opposition MP Wimal Weerawansa. The JO tried to stand in the way of the Bill even before the debate kicked off. Given the tainted profiles of many JO members, its opposition to the Bill was not that difficult to be comprehended.
The fate of National Audit Bill was unknown when this was written on Thursday. However, given the extent the Bill has already been diluted, especially with regard to its surcharge provision, there was less reason to doubt its passage at this point. The first draft of National Audit Bill was formulated far back in 2004 and it took 14 long years to come to Parliament. The Audit Bill came to the fore during the last Presidential Election campaign of Common Candidate Maithripala Sirisena and was also included in the 100-day work programme of the Government.
Constructive criticism
The attendance of Members of Parliament was very good entire this week leading to healthy debates on key legislative matters. Bouquets as well as brickbats came on the Government’s way during the full-day debate on the President’s Policy Statement, but the brickbats outnumbered the bouquets. The Government was under fire for its feeble and lacklustre performance.
JVP Leader Anura Dissanayake in a fiery speech hit hard at the Government and the two leaders at the helm for their failures in all fronts. Opposition Leader R Sampanthan, who earnestly wished to see a final and acceptable solution to National Question within his lifespan, was disheartened that the Constitutional reforms process had been stalled and that the Government was back-peddling on its own commitments. Minister Patali Champika Ranawaka, in what one might understand as a constructive criticism, said the execution and delivery of the policies are more important than how they are worded.
The President in the course of his speech made a reference to “Vajji” at the time of the Buddha. According to history, Vajji was a confederacy of neighbouring clans including the Licchavis in ancient India and Nepal. The President’s remarks on “Vajji” were no doubt aimed at Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe’s frequent mentioning of following the Buddha's preaching to Licchavi princes on ‘meeting peacefully, discussing peacefully and dispersing peacefully'.
“The national unity government consists of various political parties having different ideologies. If those political parties must function according to the path shown by the Buddha, giving priority for harmony and consensus as the Vajji at the time of the Buddha, we should also truthfully follow the steps taken by Vajji. As the President during the past three years, I conducted according to those principles,” the President worded and one may infer that it was a hint at the Prime Minister.
More than half of the President’s 35-minitues speech was spent on recapping the achievements of the Government since 2015, where he highlighted the passage of key legislations such as the National Authority on Tobacco and Alcohol Amendment Act that imposed 80 percent graphic warnings on the cigarette packets, the National Drugs Policy based on Prof Senaka Bibile’s policy, the Right to Information Act and the 19th Amendment to the Constitution. He added the Government, saddled with a debt burden of Rs. 10.3 trillion, has presented about 18 economy-related bills with a view to manage the debt and enhance the revenue. However, the Policy Statement lacked details of his future course of action for the remainder of his period.
Colourful opening ceremony
The inauguration of new session was marked by solemn ceremony attended by foreign delegates, religious leaders, Provincial Governors, Attorney General, tri-force commanders and IGP. President Maithripala Sirisena and First Lady Jayanthi Sirisena were formerly welcomed on the red carpet by Speaker Karu Jayasuriya and Parliament Secretary General Dhammika Dasanayake. The Head of State was accorded a Guard of Honour and a 21 Gun Salute by elegantly-dressed Army, Navy and Air Force personnel.
The ceremonial sitting was followed by a traditional tea party attended by the Speaker, Prime Minister, Government and Opposition MPs and other invited guests. The ceremonial sitting of Sri Lanka’s first Parliament was held on October 14, 1947, and Governor Sir Henry Monck-Mason Moore opened the Session delivering a “Throne Speech” (Raajasana Kathawa) as it was then termed. The Third Session of the Second Parliament was opened by Queen Elisabeth II on April 12, 1954 with a Throne Speech. Policy statements replaced Throne speeches after the endorsement of 1978 Constitution.
