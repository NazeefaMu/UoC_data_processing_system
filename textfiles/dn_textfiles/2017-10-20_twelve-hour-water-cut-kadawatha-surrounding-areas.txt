Twelve-hour water cut in Kadawatha, surrounding areas

 
Water supply will be disrupted for twelve hours in areas surrounding Kadawatha town, Kadawatha - Kiribathgoda line and adjoining by-lines, Ragama road, Ganemulla road and Mankada road due to pipeline repairs, today.
The Kadawatha area engineer told Daily News Online that the pipeline has been damaged in two places due to the exertion of water under high pressure.
The engineer said that repairs are under way.
The damaged pipe line has reportedly caused heavy traffic congestion in the Colombo-Kandy road.
