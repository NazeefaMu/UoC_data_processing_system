CPC councillors displeased over secretaries' absenteeism during budget debate

When the Central Provincial Council's budget debate started at the council premises at Pallekelle on Wednesday morning, Provincial Councillor Sunil Amaratunge raising a point of order expressed his opposition and regret to the absence of the Chief Secretary and secretaries of several ministries in the chamber to listen to the debate.
UNP Councillor Jeyalabdeen Lafir too expressed his opposition and regret over the issue and said relevant officials should be present in the chamber when votes of the respective ministries are taken up. UPFA member M. G. Jayaratne chaired the meeting.
However, moments after the objection raised by the two members, Chief Secretary P. B. Wijaratne arrived and took his chair in the chamber.
