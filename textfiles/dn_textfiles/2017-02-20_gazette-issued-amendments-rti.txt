Gazette issued with amendments to RTI

The Mass Media and Information Ministry had issued a gazette notification last Friday to include several amendments to the Right to Information Act No 12 of 2016 as proposed by the Right to Information Commission.
The Gazette has given the format of “Appeal form, Register of Appeals, Register of Deficient Appeals to the RTI Commission, Notice to the Appellant, and Notice to the Public Authority and/or Third Parties”.
