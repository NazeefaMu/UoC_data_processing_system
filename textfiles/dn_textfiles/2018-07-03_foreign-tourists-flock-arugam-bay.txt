Foreign tourists flock to Arugam Bay

The surfing season is drawing a large number of foreign tourists to Arugam Bay in the Ampara District.
The beach isn’t the only attraction in the area. The surrounding countryside with its quaint villages, the mangroves, jungle, lagoon, river, rice fields and dunes are also attractions for tourists.
The surfing season in Arugam Bay starts in April and ends in October. During the season, the wind is predominantly offshore. Two kilometers inland from Arugam Bay is the scenic Pottuvil Lagoon.
The Pottuvil Lagoon tour by local fishermen is another popular offering for foreign tourists visiting Arugam Bay.
The season for off-shore dolphin viewing at Arugam Bay beach is from May to September, the high season in Arugam Bay.
Twelve kilometres south of Arugam Bay is Panama, the last inhabited village that precedes the Yala East National Park.
Panama is somewhat inland, yet intersects with lagoons rich in bird life.
Arugam Bay is located 320 km from Colombo and can be reached within seven hours via Moneragala. Arugam Bay beach, a wide, sweeping sandy beach in front of Ulla village is an attraction for swimming all year round.
