Societies, ‘govijana’ movements to be funded

The societies and ‘govijana’ movements that supervise and maintain electrified fences to reduce the human-elephant conflict will be funded, Sustainable Development and Wildlife Deputy Minister Sumedha G. Jayasena said.
The country has 3,861 km long electrified fences, while further 457 km long electrified fences will be erected islandwide, the Deputy Minister said.
She was addressing the media at the Moneragala Divisional Secretariat Office.
Jayasena said over 400 civil security officers had been deployed to repair and maintain the electrified fences islandwide. Various societies and ‘govijana’ movements have been engaged in the maintenance of fences at the regional level due to the shortage of civil security officers, she said.
The Deputy Minister said 96 km additional electrified fences would be added to the existing network of 464.8 kms in the Monaragala District.
