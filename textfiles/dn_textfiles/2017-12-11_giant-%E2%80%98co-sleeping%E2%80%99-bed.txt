Giant ‘co-sleeping’ bed

There were ten in this bed, and the little one said, ‘roll over! roll over!’, so they all rolled over, but one didn’t fall out, because the bed was so flippin’ massive.
Look at the size of it. It sleeps a whole family – a considerably busy one at that.
The bed, made by The Ace Collection, is 12ft wide and 6.6ft tall. So, yes, Peter Crouch would still possibly have cold toes. But he could roll for some distance before falling off either side.
People have been enjoying the design on Facebook. A regular king size, by contrast, is just 6.3ft, which is large, of course, but dwarfed by the monster bed.
Unfortunately, given the scale, the bed isn’t cheap. The mattress costs £2,048, while the box spring frame, fitted sheets and so on would all set you back about £3,019.
hen there’s the duvet. Not sure anywhere makes one big enough! Mirror
