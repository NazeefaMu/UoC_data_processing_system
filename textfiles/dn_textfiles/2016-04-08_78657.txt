Companies’ monopoly should be broken to save CEB - Handunnetti
The network of companies around the CEB has built up a monopoly and it should be broken to save the CEB, JVP MP and COPE Chairman Sunil Handunnetti said in Parliament yesterday.
He was participating in the adjournment debate on the power crisis. Handunnetti observed the power crisis and the CEB crisis are intertwined. Explaining on the vicious cycle happening at the CEB, the MP said a solution to the power crisis could not be found without finding a solution to the CEB crisis.
“The power crisis is created by the CEB engineers themselves and then they ask the politicians to go for power cuts. The minister holding the portfolio then looks for alternatives knowing the ill-effects of power cuts. The engineers then come up with the proposal to purchase power from the private sector and those companies are owned by them. I state with responsibility it is the CEB engineers who create this crisis. They propose the same option for every minister who is appointed to the portfolio. The minister becomes miserable when the power mafia creates a power crisis. The network of companies around the CEB nourishes while the CEB suffers,” he commented.
The JVP member said a comprehensive audit is required over the private power purchases which is close to about Rs. 200 billion each year.
MP Handunnetti further observed there are 23 companies under the organisational chart of the CEB, which are not accountable to Parliament. “The five main companies of them are the LECO, SL Engineers, LTL Holdings, TPC and LCC. There are many other subsidiaries under the Lanka Transformers Limited (LTL) and out of them they deliberately avoid mentioning the names of two companies namely the LTL Esot and LTL Project. The Director Board of these two are same. There are Mohomed Jalaldeen Marikkar, Ravindra Kumar Pitigala, and U. D. Jayawardena. These three directors are found in the director boards of all the 23 companies. What happens in the CEB is similar to a pyramid scam. There are organised corruption and crimes taking place in the CEB. The above companies are a network created for those organised crimes. The government should investigate on the links between the CEB and LTL Holdings,” he noted.
He requested the government to find out the history of the officials who are behind the power mafia including the posts they held in the CEB, their current status and the initial status and their assets and liabilities.
Handunetti said LTL Holdings reluctantly appeared before Parliament recently but did not speak about the LTL Esot and LTL Project. “The Chairman of LTL Holdings is also the Chairman of CEB. Sixty three percent of its ownership is for the CEB. But its chairman clearly does not stand for the CEB,” he stated.
Power and Energy Deputy Minister making a clarification at this point said the CEB Chairman in his official capacity becomes the LTL Holding Chairman also. However, MP Handunnetti said that was the very reason why the system should change because it leads to conflict of interests.
Handunneti commenting on the recent proposal to purchase three power plants, pointed out the Chairman of Heladanavi is the current Chairman of the CEB and added that the COPE would present a detailed report on the CEB to Parliament in May.
Handunnetti also revealed that there are certain people who had not paid electricity bills for two and half years. “Why the CEB is incurring losses while the consumers make regular payments for their bills? As of December 31, 2014, the CEB has Rs. 4,132 million worth of bills older than two and half years. However, the supply to them has not been terminated” he added.
 
No interim committees for sports bodies - Dayasiri
Sports Minister Dayasiri Jayasekara told Parliament yesterday that there will be no interim committees for sports bodies as long as he is Sports Minister.
Participating in the debate on Regulations under the Convention Against Doping in Sport Act, the minister said that he had information of moves by certain persons to create interim bodies to govern several sports associations.
“I would not let anyone set up interim committees for sports associations as long as I hold this position,” he said. “It is better that I tender my resignation and go home instead permitting the establishment of interim bodies. I would not let outsiders to meddle with the affairs of sports associations. All interim Committees have been dissolved. The cricket was adversely affected by the interim committee. There was an interference at many levels in sports bodies due to these interim committes. Sri Lankan Cricket had huge debts. We are now changing this. I had discussions with IOC and the main allegation was that there was a political interference in Sri Lankan sports associations. We are changing this situation. There are a number of problems in sports bodies. They make various objections when we do correct things. If these institutions function properly, we do not have to interfere with their affairs. We would hold elections for sports associations in due time. We are at the moment engaged in massive projects targeting the 2024 Olympic games. We strive to develop sports in the correct manner,” the Minister said.
 
Power breakdowns due to poor maintenance - Ajith P. Perera
The investigations by the committees appointed to find out the cause of electricity breakdowns have revealed that the breakdowns were due to poor maintenance, Power and Renewable Energy Deputy Minister Ajith P. Perera said.
He said so far the final and detailed reports are not completed and submitted and added that there is a severe issue with the management.
“Those issues should be addressed to in ensuring a good electricity supply to the public,” the deputy minister said. “But the government never sees privatisation of the CEB is a solution to these issues. The Prime Minister has instructed to take all means to solve this issue. Privatisation is against our policies, policies of the government and our conscience”.
Perera said the government’s wish is to adopt corrective measures with the support of all in the CEB and not to make the changes by force.
He made these observations yesterday responding to the adjournment motion moved by UNP Parliamentarian Ajith Mannapperuma on issues relating to the electricity provision and breakdown of the electricity supply at three occasions in the recent past.
“The water levels of the reservoirs have gone down unusually because of the lack of exchange of details between the irrigation officials and the CEB. Now we have to introduce a proper management mechanism between the resources of the CEB so that we can preserve needy resources,” he said.
Perera said that he dares not to say that all CEB engineers are corrupt but some of them and added that the promotion process in the CEB is not acceptable as it is based on the seniority alone.
“The CEB is not owned by its engineers or the staff but by the 21 million consumers,” Deputy Minister Perera said. “So that there should not be a monopoly of the senior officials. The consumers expect a round the clock power supply throughout the year. If the government failed to do so the public would lose faith in the government.”
The deputy minister said the government would take all steps to secure an uninterrupted power supply for the country and added that the government’s attention is drawn to generate environment friendly energy - the solar power, wind power and dendro power.
“We also have means to use our own gas in future. The solar power is one of the most reliable sources. But the CEB officials say there is no stability in solar power supply. But we have to take policy decisions to make it a reality.” he said.
Deputy Minister Perera said there is s possibility to make each house a solar power power plant in the future. The 65,000 houses that are planned to be set up in the North are will have solar panels on the roofs. He said that net metering and net accounting is to be introduced so that the hoses that have solar panels could earn an extra income and added that there are plans to generate 745 MW wind power and 1,100 MW solar power.
 
Two JO members appointed to COPE, COPA
Deputy Speaker Thilanga Sumathipala yesterday announced that two members of the joint opposition have been appointed to the Committee on Public Enterprises (COPE) and to the Committee on Public Accounts (COPA).

He made these announcements following a query by Joint Opposition Member Dinesh Gunawardena following the round of questions for oral answers on the appointment of the Joint Opposition members to the COPE and the COPA.
“The Speaker had observed that he would appoint two members of the Joint Opposition to the COPE and the COPA to redress the issues faced by the same in Parliament,” Dinesh Gunawardena said. “We have nominated our members three weeks ago. The Speaker again promised at the Party Leaders Meeting to make those appointments. But even after weeks nothing has happened.”
The Leader of the House and Minister Lakshman Kiriella said that the government is ready to accept them. “Now for example 10 out of the 17 members of the Oversight Committees are from the Opposition,” Minister Kiriella said. “During the 2002 UNP regime then Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe appointed late Jeyaraj Fernadopulle as the COPE chairman.”
At this stage Deputy Speaker Sumathipala observed that he would make a statement after discussing the matter with Speaker Karu Jayasuriya.
 
More room for ministerial appointments - Gayantha
The government as a National Government consists of 92 cabinet, state and deputy ministers, Mass Media and Parliamentary Reforms Minister Gayantha Karunathilake said in Parliament yesterday.
He said there are 47 cabinet ministers including President Maithripala Sirisena, 20 state ministers and 25 deputy ministers in the government.
“There is more room for appointment of new ministers and some other members from the joint opposition are planing to join the government. The government will consider their moves too in future,” Karunathilake said.
“The members of the joint opposition could find out as to what extent the number of ministers would expand by checking who have plans to join the government.”
“However, there is room for expansion as this is a National Government,” Minister Karunathilake said.
He made these observations yesterday when Opposition Member Mahinda Yapa Abeywardena questioned as to who would reveal the statistics in relation to the number of ministers as promised by the government on Wednesday.
 
‘SAITM not bound to reveal A-L results, Z-scores of their students’
Leader of the House and Higher Education and Highways Minister Lakshman Kiriella yesterday told Parliament that the SAITM private institute in Malabe is not bound to reveal information on the A-L results and the Z-scores of the students admitted to its medical degree.
The minister was responding to a question by JVP MP Dr. Nalinda Jayatissa. The minister said the government has no legal right to demand information on the students and teaching staff of SAITM as it is a private organisation.
“We can only make a request. If they do not reply, then the government can do nothing. However, I will try to obtain the information requested by the MP,” he said. However, the minister said there had been several incidents of enrolling students with lower qualifications to the SAITM during the first few years it started awarding medical degrees, but said it had stopped after the intervention of the UGC.
The MP asked if the SAITM is considered a private organisation, why a Director of SAITM is sitting in the UGC board. The minister replying to this query noted the said director had been appointed to the UGC board not representing the SAITM, but due to his professional qualifications.
 
Pre-propaganda documents sent to FCID
Sports Minister Dayasiri Jayasekera told Parliament yesterday that relevant documents and bills pertaining to the pre-propaganda and other purposes aimed at hosting the Commonwealth Games of 2018 in Hambantota has been submitted to the FCID to ascertain whether any finance misappropriation has taken place in the bidding process.
The minister was responding to an oral question by JVP MP Sunil Hadunnetti. The Authorities has received Rs. 10 million from the Sports Fund, Rs. 100 million from the Sports Ministry and Rs. 577 million from the private sector for the pre-propaganda campaign and other purposes and the relevant audit documents have been sent to FCID now.
 
CEB management should accept responsibility
Megapolis and Western Development Minister, Patali Champika Ranawaka told Parliament yesterday the CEB management should accept the responsibility for the break down in the electricity supply on three occasions in the last few months.
“Even during the war period, there were no such break down. There is no severe drought in the country. But generally a dry climatic condition in the months of April, May and June. However, there should have been no problem on the power supply because there was an ample rain last January. Eeven, when there was a water crisis, there was no power shortage like this.
“We have an excess electricity production than the required electricity generation capacity. Therefore, authorities cannot say that they cannot provide electricity. There is minor clique sabotaging this purpose. If the solutions suggested in 2011 by myself were implemented, this situation could not have arisen today. If the proposals suggested regarding the power crisis of the Puttalam coal power plant were implemented, we would not have to purchase power from outside.
This has caused a loss of Rs. 400 million to the government. The agreement for the Lakvijaya power plant was signed with the Chinese company by the former Chainman and the project director of CEB and not the politicians.
Therefore, they cannot say now the plant has many faults. Today CEB Chairman get a monthly salary of over one million and the deputy general manager over 700,000 which is acceptable since they have work hard to serve the people.
But they should be dedicated and committed to provide uninterrupted power to the masses.
 
Minister should crackdown on sports mafia
UPFA MP Mahindananda Aluthgamage said in Parliament yesterday that sports mafia which was under control sometime back has raised its head again.
The Sports Minister should crack down on the sports mafia while bringing necessary laws to uplift the sports sector.
He said so, while participating in the debate on regulations under the Convention against Doping in Sport Act.
“During my time, there was a huge sport mafia. But I managed to control it. There was a Secretary of former Defense Secretary Gotabhaya Rajapaksa who was involved in athletics. But, I managed to remove him from that position. “We did not dance according to the tunes of National Olympic Committee. We also removed Manilal Fernando from football and stopped the mafia in the sports. Why Minister Jayasekara is unable to control
the mafia? We also had a programme to take sports to village level during our regime. Former President Mahinda Rajapaksa allocated Rs. 4,500 million to implement this programme considering its importance. But, this government has so far no such a programme to develop rural sports even after the lapse of 15 months in power.
The government has not even been able to hold an election for many sports bodies even after the lapse of 15 months,” he said.
 
Five ministries to manage Meethotamulla garbage dump
A special programme has been implemented jointly by five ministries to manage the garbage dump in Meethotamulla, Western Development and Megapolis Deputy Minister Lasantha Alagiyawanna said in Parliament yesterday.
Responding to a question by UNP MP S. M. Marikkar, the deputy minister said the recycling project of Meethotamulla garbage dump will be implemented as a public-private joint venture, adding that the project is earmarked for two years. He said when the UDA called for tenders for the project, 57 applicants had applied.
“The project includes power generation. The lands required for the project have been released. A committee comprising of the Secretaries of the five ministries has been appointed to look into this project. In addition to these measures, the President has appointed a Cabinet Sub-Committee and it is also deliberating on the ways and means of managing the Meethotamulla garbage dump,” he said. The Deputy Minister said, as there had been opposition to the proposal to shift the garbage to Puttalam, attention had been paid on alternative proposals now. He said the residents in Meethotamulla who had been affected by the garbage dump would be compensated and given accommodation elsewhere in Kolonnawa with the coordination of the Colombo Municipal Council.

‘Sports sector highly commercialised’
JVP MP Bimal Ratnayake told Parliament yesterday that the entire sports sector has been swamped by money today.
“There is a growing use of steroids as sports has become highly commercialised today”.
He said so, while participating in the debate on regulations under the Convention Against Doping in Sport Act. The sportsmen have become sick due to the usage of banned drugs. Some sportsmen appear in advertisements for various products. But this is damaging the image of sports as many products are not suitable for the human consumption. Therefore, there must be a disciplinary code for sportsmen that governs their commercial interests. There should be a unit to identify performance enhancing substances that are of Ayurvedic origin as well.
