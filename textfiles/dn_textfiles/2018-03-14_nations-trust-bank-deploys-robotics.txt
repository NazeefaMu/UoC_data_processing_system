Nations Trust Bank deploys robotics

A digital banking platform, data analytic and robotics is helping Sri Lanka’s Nations Trust Bank increase productivity and expand without incurring huge infrastructure and environmental costs, the bank told shareholders.
In 2017, Nations Trust launched FriMi which allows customers to open savings accounts from their mobile phones without visiting a branch.
“We believe this is a game changer which will shape the future of banking in Sri Lanka,” Renuka Fernando, Chief Executive Officer at Nations Trust said.
The bank is also piloting robotic processing in over 50 processes and using data analytics to improve operational efficiencies and reduce costs.
FriMi, is an all-in-one bank account, payment system and e-wallet. Customers can send and receive money and pay utility bills. It’s a virtual debit card that can pay for goods at over 600 stores.
Customers on digital platforms increased to nearly 28 percent of Nations Trust’s total customer base in 2017, up from 19 percent a year earlier. (ECONOMYNEXT )
