Coca Cola keen on using Sri Lanka as a production hub

Asia Pacific chiefs of Coca Cola say that they are ready to develop Sri Lanka as a production hub in the region. The President and the Executive Vice President of Coca Cola Company Asia Pacific Group met Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayake in Colombo last week.
They pointed out that Sri Lanka could be developed to a production hub to re-export their products to India. India has the highest demand for Coca Cola products in the South Asian region. The two presidents pointed out that Sri Lanka can earn a huge sum of foreign exchange while generating job opportunities to the youth.
The two officials also discussed with Minister Karunanayake about the use of Sri Lanka’s natural water resources and tea related products to manufacture Coca Cola brands and re-export the final products.
They proposed to develop Sri Lanka as a manufacturing hub and re-export their brands to India as there is a huge demand for Coca Cola brands in India.
John Murphy and Irial Finan were concerned about the stability about the rate of taxation on foreign investment. They were also happy that the government is maintaining cordial relations with foreign investors in the country.
