Retracing the Portuguese

The International Centre for Ethnic Studies has organises a discussion on the ‘Portuguese Burghers of Sri Lanka, their language, and cultural expression’.
Hugo Cardoso from University of Lisbon will deliver the introductory speech on the Portuguese Burgher Community in Modern Sri Lanka. Earl Barthelot, a Representative of the Portuguese Burgher Community, will deal with the main characteristics and history of Sri Lanka Portuguese Language. Patrícia Costa from University of Lisbon will talk about Sri Lanka, Portuguese and the Portuguese Burghers. Dinali Fernando from University of Kelaniya will deliver a speech on a socio-linguistic survey of the community and revitalisation opportunities. Rui Pereira from University of Lisbon will talk about research on Burgher music and dance. The discussion will be held at the ICES Auditorium on October 31 at 3.30 pm.
The Portuguese Burghers have long been an important component of Sri Lanka's diverse human landscape. Their contributions to the culture of the island run deep. While they are and have historically been present in various parts of Sri Lanka, nowadays they concentrate mostly in the Eastern Province, where their status as a local minority often puts pressure on aspects of their distinctive culture.
This discussion is connected with the research project ‘Documentation of Sri Lanka Portuguese, coordinated by the University of Lisbon's Centre for Linguistics, in collaboration with the International Centre for Ethnic Studies (ICES) and other institutions in Sri Lanka and abroad. The project is currently building a community-accessible archive of the Portuguese Burghers' language, music and dance traditions, as well as several other aspects of heritage and memory. The discussion will present some results and on-going activities, and reflect on the prospects for long-term cultural preservation within the context of Sri Lanka and the modern world.
The discussion will consist of brief presentations by a panel followed by a Q &A.
