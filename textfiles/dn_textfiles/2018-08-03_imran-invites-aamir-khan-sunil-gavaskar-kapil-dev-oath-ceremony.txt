Imran invites Aamir Khan, Sunil Gavaskar, Kapil Dev to oath ceremony

Imran Khan, Pakistan’s prime minister-to-be, has invited actor Aamir Khan and former cricketers Sunil Gavaskar, Kapil Dev and Navjot Singh Sidhu to his oath-taking ceremony on August 11. Sidhu accepted the invitation, calling Imran Khan “a man of character”.
“It is a great honour and I accept the invitation. Men of genius are admired, men of power are feared but men of character are trusted. Khan Sahab is a man of character. He can be trusted,” said Sidhu, also a cricketer-turned-politician.
Imran Khan’s Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf emerged as the single largest party in Pakistan’s national assembly after the July 25 general election in the country. It is still short of numbers to form the government on its own. NDTV
