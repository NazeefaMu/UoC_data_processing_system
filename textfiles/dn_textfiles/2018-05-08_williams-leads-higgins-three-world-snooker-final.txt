Williams leads Higgins by three in World Snooker final

LONDON, Sunday: Two-time champion Mark Williams holds a 10-7 lead over four-time winner John Higgins after a fascinating first day of the World Championship final.
Wales’ Williams, 43, surged 4-0 ahead before Higgins found his form to get off the mark with a century break.
Two further tons helped the 42-year-old Scot level the final at 7-7 but Williams added one of his own as he won the last three frames of the day. The best-of-35 final resumes on Monday.
The winner will collect the trophy and a record £425,000 in prize money at Sheffield’s Crucible Theatre. Both players are aiming to become the oldest champion since Ray Reardon, who was 45 when he triumphed in 1978, and shared four centuries and eight further breaks of 50 or more.
