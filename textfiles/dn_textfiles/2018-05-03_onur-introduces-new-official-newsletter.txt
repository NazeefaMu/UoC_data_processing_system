ONUR introduces new official newsletter

The newly-designed official newsletter of the Office for National Unity and Reconciliation (ONUR), was introduced recently. Under the name Samagiya (Unity), the newsletter had focused on the programmes and activities conducted by the ONUR in order to enhance national unity and reconciliation. It is a quarterly, tri-lingual newsletter published in Sinhala, Tamil and English.
Achieving national unity and reconciliation was a key feature to the January 2015 Presidential campaign. To give effect to this commitment, the Sri Lankan Government established the Office for National Unity and Reconciliation (ONUR).
The resolution was moved by Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe, approved by the Cabinet, established under President Maithripala Sirisena and chaired by former President Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga.
