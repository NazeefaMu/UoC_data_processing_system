History against All Blacks' Williams and Scotland

Edinburgh: Sonny Bill Williams confesses to being unaware that the All Blacks have never lost to Scotland but insists the back-to-back world champions are "on edge" as they prepare for a Test that falls on the 112th anniversary of the first match between the countries.
Since the 'Original' All Blacks beat Scotland 12-7 on a skating rink of a pitch at Inverleith in Edinburgh on November 18 1905, New Zealand have maintained an historic aura of invincibility against the Scots.
They've won 28 out of 30 Tests between the sides with two Murrayfield draws (0-0 in 1964 and 25-25 in 1983) the closest Scotland have come to victory.
"I wasn't aware of that," said Williams, retained at inside centre for Saturday's match at Murrayfield despite the mental aberration he suffered, together with a yellow card, when batting the ball out of play in the second half of the world champions' 38-18 win against France in Paris last weekend.
"Obviously it is motivation," the Blues player added, when asked about avoiding becoming a member of the first New Zealand side to fall to the Scots.
"But as All Blacks we always put pressure on ourselves to not just win but play well.”
Last Saturday, Scotland leaked five tries in a 44-38 victory against a Samoa side the All Blacks thrashed 78-0 five months ago but Williams pointed to Scotland’s 24-19 win against Australia in Sydney in June, in Gregor Townsend’s second match as coach, as a warning sign.
"It's really put us on the edge of our seats in our preparation, knowing that they can knock off the big boys," said Williams, whose mother is of Scottish descent.
"They’ve got some dangerous players and the flavour of the rugby they’re playing at the moment is great to see. Coming up against that has put us on edge."
All Blacks coach Steve Hansen has afforded Scotland the respect of selecting a full-strength side, the only change to the starting XV that beat France being the introduction of Codie Taylor for the injured Dane Coles at hooker.
