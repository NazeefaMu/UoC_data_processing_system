Unique dansala by Serendib

Serendib Flour Mills (SFML) held a Dansala near the Narahenpita Police Hospital for the third consecutive year. The Banis Dansala was organized in partnership with Miyurasa Bakery in Narahenpita where 15,000 buns were distributed. The buns were prepared hygienically and packed in environmental-friendly paper bags. The Dansal commenced with a Buddhist priest chanting the gatha.
The event drew a large crowed and it also coincides with Serendib Flour Mills’ 10th Anniversary of successful operations. To mark the occasion, SFML has embarked on an annual campaign on the theme of ‘Nourishing the Nation’. As part of this initiative, 2,500 loaves of bread were distributed at the Piliyandala Dansal and 1,750 loaves of bread were distributed at the Mahiyangana Dansal by the company. SFML plans to conduct a similar Dansal for the upcoming Poson Poya as well.
Commenting on the occasion, Chief Executive officer, Serendib Flour Mills, Mohamed Riyal said “As a company, SFML is committed to nourishing the nation with our nutritious and high quality products because we believe in offering our customers nothing but the best for their well-being. Occasions such as this Vesak festival are an opportune time for the company to reward its customers for their loyalty and support. SFML engages closely with local communities and organizing Dansals is an ideal way to connect with our stakeholders. We are especially proud to host the Dansals this year as we are also celebrating the company’s 10th anniversary of sustainable operations.”
The company’s hygienic and nourishing products have gained popularity amongst loyal customers who have placed their faith in the company’s high quality standards.
