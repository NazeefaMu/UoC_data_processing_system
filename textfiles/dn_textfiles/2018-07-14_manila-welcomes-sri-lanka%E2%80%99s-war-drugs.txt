Manila welcomes Sri Lanka’s war on drugs

MANILA – Malacañang on Thursday lauded the government of Sri Lanka for its plan to replicate the “success” of the Philippines’ war on drugs.
Presidential Spokesperson Harry Roque made this reaction after Sri Lankan President Maithripala Sirisena has recognized Philippines’ successful approach against illegal drugs.
“Of course, we are happy that other countries have taken note of our war on drugs, and that they look upon us as best practice on dealing with illegal drugs,” Roque said in a Palace press briefing.
“So we appreciate that, but as of now, we still have no death penalty,” he added.
According to media reports, the government of Sri Lanka will begin hanging drug dealers to “replicate success of Philippines”.
Sirisena said he was ready to sign the “death warrants” of repeat drug offenders after nearly 50 years of moratorium on executions.
“I think, we have not reached that point that will hang them. We are still on the level of really using our police, PDEA and NBI and our political will against drug pushers,” Roque said.
In the Philippines, the war on drugs is being implemented by the Philippine National Police, Philippine Drug Enforcement Agency and the National Bureau of Investigation.
