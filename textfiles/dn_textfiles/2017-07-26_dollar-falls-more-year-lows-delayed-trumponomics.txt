Dollar falls to more than year lows on delayed Trumponomics

The U.S. dollar fell to levels seen more than an year ago with President Donald Trump failing to deliver on tax cuts and infrastructure spending, analysts said.
The dollar index, which measures the greenback against a basket of currencies, traded at 93.904, declining from levels above 95.00 traded in the previous week, CNBC reported.
“A lot of people came into this year expecting a big stimulus from Trumponomics, potentially a big tax cut, infrastructure,” Richard Clarida, global strategic adviser at Pimco said.
“And of course, we haven’t got the tax cut, infrastructure is down the road and Congress is squabbling over health care. So some of the folks who really thought this would be a gangbusters year have been disappointed.”
