‘SLFP, UPFA will not support Ranil to form government’

The Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) or the United People's Freedom Alliance (UPFA) will not support Ranil Wickremesinghe to form a Government, Parliamentarian Lakshman Yapa Abeywardene said.
Abeywardene was speaking to the media following the UPFA group meeting with President Maithripala Sirisena yesterday evening. Abeywardene said the President had told the group that all 95 UPFA members should work in unity and in future no SLFP member will be allowed to support Ranil Wickremesinghe to form a government.
Abeywardene said the UPFA will sit in the opposition in future.
