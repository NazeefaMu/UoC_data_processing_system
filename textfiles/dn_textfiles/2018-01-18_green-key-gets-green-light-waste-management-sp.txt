Chief Government Whip Ajith Rajapaksa coordinated the discussion.
At the discussion, both Chief Executive Officer Michel Hill and Project Director Brent Lee Greer made presentations over the proposed project which convinced the councilors and ministers who expressed their satisfaction over the intended strategies of the project and its projected outcomes and benefits.
Green Key Enterprises LLC, based in Utah, USA, said that they had been successful in introducing and implementing municipal solid waste (MSW) recycling solutions through the use of a combination of specialized technologies.
Usng MSW as input, Green Key will produce lumber, energy, and bio-diesel as key outputs that could be reused to meet construction and consumption needs.
Green Key will carry out waste management in the Southern districts of Galle, Matara and Hambantota. They will undertake waste collection, sorting, processing and output generation of Waste to Lumber (W2L) and Waste to Energy (W2E) through the generation of electricity and bio-diesel.
In his deliberations, Michel Hill said that they had already entered into a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with Taprobane Waste Management.
Green Key is well equipped with its own technology and is reputed in the field of recycling solutions. Green Key will tie up with the Weepel Group which is one of the W2E (waste to energy) companies in manufacturing bio-diesel.
Green Key plans to invest US$ 200 million through private equity funds in the initial stages of the project. The company hopes to establish their recycling plant in a landfill to be purchased or leased in Matara district as it has highway accessibility.
The Green Key project will help Sri Lankan authorities to eliminate the chronically disturbing waste problem in the region as the company would collect and process the waste piled throughout the province.
The lumber produced can be used for construction and exporting, while the energy and bio-diesel could be supplied to the National Grid and CEPETCO.
