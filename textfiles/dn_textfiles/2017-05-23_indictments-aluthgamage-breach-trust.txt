Indictments on Aluthgamage for breach of trust

The Colombo High Court yesterday served indictments on former Sports Minister and Kandy District MP Mahindananda Aluthgamage.
This is in connection with an indictment filed against him by the Attorney General for alleged criminal breach of trust of Rs.3.9 million funds belonging to a trade union named Sri Lanka Nidahas Kamkaru Congress. When the case came up before Colombo High Court Judge Sampath Wijeratne, Aluthgamage was ordered to be released on two sureties of Rs. 2 million and was further barred from leaving the country. Kalinga Indatissa PC with counsel Niroshan Siriwardena appearing for Aluthgamage told court that they were expecting to raise preliminary objections regarding the maintainability of the case over a jurisdiction issue.
The Attorney General alleged that former Sports Minister Aluthgamage has committed a criminal breach of trust with regard to Rs.1,000,000, misappropriated Rs.1,900,000 and misappropriated another Rs.1,000,000 belonging to the Sri Lanka Nidahas Kamkaru Congress between October, 2012 and April 2013.
The Attorney General charged that the accused had committed punishable offences under section 388 and 389 of the Penal Code.
The Attorney General has listed 13 persons as the witnesses in the case and named eight documents as production items of the case.
Deputy Solicitor General Thusith Mudalige appeared for the Attorney General.
