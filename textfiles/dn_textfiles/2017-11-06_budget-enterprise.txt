A BUDGET FOR ENTERPRISE

Perhaps it is sometimes easy to forget how far we have come as a nation. Since 2015 our economy has undergone huge transformation at a time of global turbulence. Strengthening macroeconomic stability amidst a supportive policy framework has been crucial to realizing our true potential. Now we have received strong recognition by international financial experts that the reforms we have taken are the right ones and it is clear that our international reputation is restored and strong.
We recognize there is still so much more to do as we work hard to secure a better future for all Sri Lankans. Sri Lanka has a long history of excelling as a trading nation but we need to create a climate where people can reach their full potential, where entrepreneurs can flourish and where women are able to play their full role as equals in business and commerce.
Spirit of national competitiveness
So, the forthcoming Budget will be a budget for enterprise. A lean, clean and green budget. A bold attempt to reawaken the spirit of enterprise in Sri Lanka and an opportunity to kick start the economy and move forward. To become an Indian Ocean hub for trade, investment and for global talent.
The spirit of national competitiveness must be reawakened; to do so Sri Lanka needs to liberalize and globalized. Our ancient forefathers excelled as traders and entrepreneurs in the Anuradhapura/Polonnaruwa era because they were out ward looking and were not afraid to compete with the world. The time has come again, to unleash the dormant talent of our people by giving them a helping hand.
A prime objective of this is to assist the business community by offering credit under more flexible terms as we set up a special Bank for Development Finance. We will strip away unnecessary bureaucracy and hurdles to receiving investment and make the process easier. This will mean access to credit for entrepreneurs at non-punitive and affordable rates. Giving young people access to investment and creating wealth and jobs.
Access to loan concessions
We are able to do this because we have effectively managed our nation’s debt. In the near future the Rupees three trillion debt we inherited from the Rajapaksa regime will be settled. Then we will be an even stronger position to give a helping hand to business, to entrepreneurs and to our future. Investing billions to ensure our people get education, skills training and can find jobs.
So, we are making sure investment reaches the right people and expanding schemes to help Sri Lankan business and entrepreneurs, making sure those who deserve backing and support receive it.
We will encourage women by making sure medium sized companies run by females get access to loan concessions. Policies toward helping business women will be progressive and recognize equality of opportunity. We recognize the contribution Sri Lankan women make to society and we want them to fulfil their full potential.
International recognition of the major reforms we have undertaken such as the Inland Revenue Act means there will be incentives to foreign direct investment in Sri Lanka. This will provide much needed resources and stimulus to our local business, industry and enterprise.
The IMF recognizes our good governance in Sri Lanka and that we have met targets on finance and the economy. Within the next two years we will see the full benefits of the restoration of our GSP+ status by the EU. We are already seeing our fishing industry helped by the removal of the European ban on fishery products from Sri Lanka.
Better future for all Sri Lankans
Investment is only possible because of the measures our government has taken to build a strong economy. Some of those decisions have been hard and tough laws have been put in place. But let me assure you, decisions are always taken in the best interests of Sri Lanka and its people. We are working to fix the mistakes of the past and building a stronger economy for a better future for all Sri Lankans.
We are building a strong economy and relieving future generations from the burden of debt. Ours will be a good legacy for a happy future for Sri Lankans. The imminent Budget will send a strong signal that Sri Lanka is a vibrant trading nation with a strong economy.
It will be a budget to help the environment, to foster enterprise and will result in a better country for everyone.
