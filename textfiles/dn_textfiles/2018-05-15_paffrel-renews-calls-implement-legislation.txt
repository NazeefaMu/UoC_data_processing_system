Limitation of campaign expenditures
PAFFREL renews calls to implement legislation

The People's Action for Free and Fair Elections (PAFFREL) yesterday renewed its calls to implement the proposed legislation to limit the spending of political parties and candidates for election campaigning before the upcoming provincial council elections.
PAFFREL Executive Director Rohana Hettiarachchi, writing to Provincial Councils and Local Government Minister Faiszer Musthapha, requested to speed up the proposed bill on 'Campaign Finance Upper Limitation for Elections,' to ensure a level playing field for all candidates. Election watchdog PAFFREL presented a draft bill for this purpose to the minister on August 3, 2017 and forwarded it to all 225 MPs for their perusal. Hettiarachchi said the bill was drafted with the consultation of election secretariat officials, political parties and intellectuals in the relevant fields.
He added that the proposed bill had set the upper limit of a candidate’s election expenditure as Rs. 50 per voter.
“Provisions to disqualify the candidates if they do not properly declare their assets and liabilities, had also been included in the bill. The government may bring in amendments as necessary. During the last local government elections, there were instances where candidates had spent millions to bribe voters in their electorates,” Hettiarachchi said.
“A candidate in Moneragala had spent about Rs. 40 million and we have even filed a case in the courts in this regard. If this trend continues, voters would be bought by candidates and the intentions of revising the electoral system would not be realised. We will not give up our struggle to see this legislation through,” he added. Asked from a Local Government and Provincial Councils Ministry Legal Division official, she said the bill had been added to this year’s action plan and therefore, it would be presented this year. She added that the ministry had to give priority for Local Government and Provincial Council Elections Amendment Bills during the last few months.
However, when contacted by the Daily News, Ministry Secretary Kamal Padmasiri said he was unaware of such a draft bill which had been handed over to the minister by the PAFFREL, last year.
