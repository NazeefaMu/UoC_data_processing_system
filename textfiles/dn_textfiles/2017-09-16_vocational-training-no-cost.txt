Vocational training at no cost

President Maithripala Sirisena has decided to offer vocational training free of charge and allocated Rs. 10 billion to the Skills Development and Vocational Training Ministry for the purpose. This is a good answer to critics who question the government’s record of performance, Skills Development and Vocational Training Minister Chandima Weerakkody said. He was addressing a meeting at Hall de Galle in Galle to mark the distribution of NVQ certificates to a group of preschool teachers in the Galle district recently.
Weerakkody said as members of the government, they were committed to do what was right. It was the duty of preschool teachers to contribute towards building a disciplined and right thinking future generation, who would not cow down to injustice.
