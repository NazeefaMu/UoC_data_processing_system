Pakistan re-launches YMMA computer centre

Pakistan through its High Commission donated 17 computers and equipment to re-launch and up-grade Pakistan Computer Centre at All Ceylon Young Mens’ Muslim Association Conference (YMMA), at their Headquarters in Maradana, Colombo.
This is to augment younger generation’s skills building with better educational opportunities.
Acting Pakistani High Commissioner Dr. Sarfraz Ahmed Khan Sipra was the chief guest at the re-launching ceremony. The Pakistan Computer Centre was established in 2006 with the support of Pakistan.
All Ceylon YMMA Conference National President M. Thaufiq Zubyr thanked the government and people of Pakistan for re-launching and up-grading the Pakistan Computer Centre. He said the computers, which were a long-felt need, would help to provide ICT training to youngsters. He said all communities would benefit from this facility without discrimination.
Acting High Commissioner Dr. Sarfraz Sipra appreciated the charitable services of All Ceylon YMMA Conference by promoting activities in every field while contributing to the building of a healthy, vigorous and intelligent youth in the country. He reiterated that Pakistan will continue to support Sri Lanka in enhancing youths’ skills.
Dr. Sipra noted that the Pakistan Computer Centre management in partnership with National Apprentice and Industrial Training Authority (NAITA) would bring the desired outcome from this centre. He praised the working model and contribution rendered by the NAITA towards the enhancement of Sri Lankan youths’ skills and providing them with right jobs. All Ceylon YMMA Conference primarily is a youth and youth serving community based organization (CBO), founded on April 30, 1950. The conference is national in outlook with 102 branches in Sri Lanka.
The project adds to various socioeconomic development projects by the government and people of Pakistan for their Sri Lankan brethren in housing, health, education, and livelihood sectors.
