Death of youth in Tellippalai
IGP calls for special investigation

On the orders of IGP Pujith Jayasundera, a special police investigation has been launched into the death of a youth in a police shooting near a church in Mallakam, Tellippalai, Jaffna, on June 17 night, during the church feast.
Police said they were compelled to open fire to thwart a group which came to attack them with a sword when they tried to settle a clash between two rival groups, while the feast was in progress. There was a tense situation near the church after the shooting, with people abusing the police and jeering at them. Later the STF was called in to settle the tension and allow the District Judge to arrive at the scene and conduct an inquiry into the death.
