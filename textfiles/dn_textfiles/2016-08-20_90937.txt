REVIEW OF SRI LANKA-AUSTRALIA TEST SERIES: When the Lion roared and the Kangaroo cowed

For any country beating Australia is considered a great achievement because they have been the benchmark of what international cricket should be for many years. Although many players have retired through the years Australia have through their strong first-class domestic system found replacements good enough to keep them on top of world cricket in Tests and One-Day Internationals.
When Steve Smith’s Australians arrived in Sri Lanka for a lengthy two-month tour they were heralded as the number one Test team and were awarded the Test mace by the ICC shortly before the commencement of the three-Test series. The Australians were determined to set straight their poor record in the subcontinent where they had lost 0-4 in India and 0-2 to Pakistan in UAE previously. So single-minded were they that they came a fortnight ahead of the tour proper to commence their preparations for the series against Sri Lanka to accustom themselves to the heat, humidity and the turning pitches they would encounter during the tour. According to Smith and the team management they had done everything they thought was right to prepare themselves for the series ahead.
Sri Lanka on the other hand was coming from a bad tour of England where they had lost the three-Test series 0-2, the ODI series 0-3 as well as the one-off T20I. Things were not looking rosy for Angelo Mathews and his men when the Australian Test series began at Pallekele.
The worst fears were rekindled when Sri Lanka winning the toss and batting first were bundled out for 117 in their first innings. Was this going to be another nightmare series as in England Australia gained a first innings advantage of 86 and when Sri Lanka lost four wickets for 86 in their second innings, the writing seemed to be on the wall for another disastrous series.
Sri Lanka needed someone to rescue them from this terrible trend that was following them. Then from nowhere emerged a young lad of 21 by the name of Kusal Mendis who was to be the savior of Sri Lanka cricket and perhaps its future. Cometh the hour, cometh the man. Mendis who had shown a lot of promise in the few Tests he had played at the highest level eventually made it big when his country needs him most. He played an innings out of this world – 176 when only one other batsman made a fifty in the Test to wrest the initiative away from Australia. That innings of Mendis proved to be the cornerstone of Sri Lanka going ahead and beating the Aussies 3-0 in the series to record their fourth white-wash of a Test side after Zimbabwe, Bangladesh and West Indies and laying their hands on the Warne-Muralithran trophy for the first time.
Stunned by this amazing knock of Mendis, the Australians who had 268 to chase and win at Pallekele succumbed for 161 to hand out a 106-run win for Sri Lanka. It was just the antidote that Sri Lanka needed to turn the corner and from there onwards it was more of a roller-coaster ride to winning the Test series.
What is pertinent to mention here is that it was not one player who took the limelight during the series because in each of the remaining two Tests there was someone who put their hand up to pull the side out of trouble. At Galle it was Dilruwan Perera’s fine all-round contribution (64 and 10/99) that contributed towards the 229-run win and at the SSC it was another youngster Dhananjaya de Silva who shone. De Silva’s maiden Test hundred was scored at a time when Sri Lanka was reeling at 26-5 in the first innings. With Dinesh Chandimal who also made a hundred, De Silva put on a record 211 runs for the sixth wicket that gave Sri Lanka a decent total of 355 to defend. De Silva then followed his first innings 129 with another fine knock of 65 not out that enabled his team to set Australia with a tall target of 324 to chase on a difficult pitch. What was so impressive about De Silva’s batting was his cool composure at the wicket and the amount of time he has to play his shots – hallmarks of a great cricketer in the making.
There were also others who made their mark during the series like Lakshan Sandakan, who bowls left-arm chinaman and took seven wickets on his debut and the two experienced campaigners Rangana Herath and Kaushal Silva. Herath has proved time and again that he is one of the best left-arm spinners in the world and in this series his accurate bowling and deft change of pace and flight proved too much for the hapless Australians who had no clue how to tackle the spin and the skid that subcontinent pitches generate.
As Smith admitted that on Australian pitches the ball would only bounce and spin but here it was different. The biggest problem for the Australians was the skidding ball which neither their batsmen nor their bowlers were able to master.
Herath proved a handful with a handsome pile up 28 wickets (that included a hat-trick), the second most in a series for Sri Lanka after Muthiah Muralitharan’s 30 against Zimbabwe in 2001-02. He was not only a thorn in the Australian side with his bowling but also with his brave batting. The off-spin of Dilruwan Perera proved an ideal foil to Herath. Overall the Lankan spinners domination of the series was quite apparent with 54 of the 58 wickets being taken by them. Sri Lanka used their fast bowlers only for 37 overs for the entire series.
In a way as Mathews admitted the injury to Suranga Lakmal proved a blessing in disguise at Pallekele for had he come through a fitness test Sri Lanka wouldn’t have debuted young spinner Sandakan and who knows the series may have ended differently.
A word of praise for the team management and the national selectors for keeping faith in the two openers despite their constant failures and for the faith coach Graham Ford had in the team. Although Dimuth Karunaratne failed to make it big, his partner Kaushal Silva came good on his home ground at the SSC to carve out a century one which he described as possible because of the stitches to his left webbing that prevented him from driving and chasing balls outside the off stump that had led to his downfall.
If at all Australia had a hero on what turned out to be a nightmare series for them it was the magnificent bowling of Mitchell Starc who under conditions not favourable for fast bowling was the standout bowler apart from Herath in the series. His 24 wickets in the series is testimony to hard work and discipline and if Australia could have put more runs on the board his bowling would have made the difference between victory and defeat.
