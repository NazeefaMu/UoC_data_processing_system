Yala National Park earns over Rs 700 mn in 2017

The Yala National Park earned Rs. 700.58 million in revenue in 2017. This is the highest income earned by a national park in Sri Lanka.
Deputy Park Warden Ranjith Sisira Kumara said that the number of visitors to Yala is expected to grow in the months of April, August and December. He said that eight bungalows have been opened to cater to the accommodation needs of both foreign and local visitors to the Park, home to over 100 elephants.
Well-known tusker Gemunu has always been popular with foreign and local tourists. “He goes close to the jeeps in search of food.”
He said that Gemunu had lost one of his tusks when he was attacked by another tusker, Sando, a few days ago.
Wildlife conservationists say that his life is at risk and measures need to be taken to protect Gemunu. The Deputy Park Warden said that all steps will be taken to protect the lives of not only elephants and tuskers, but all other animals as well.
