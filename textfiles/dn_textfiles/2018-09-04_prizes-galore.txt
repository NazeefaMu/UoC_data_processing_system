Prizes galore

Colombo Vivakanda National School’s annual Prize Giving Day was held recently at the college auditorium under patronage of the school Principal A R Nalaiya.
Education Minister Akila Viraj Kariyawasam participated as the Chief Guest. Colombo District Member of Parliament Mujeebur Rahuman, Western Provincial Council T K Kurusamy, old boys, parents, former principals and teaches took part.
The school was started in Colombo Central with only 25 students 93 years ago. Today the school houses more than 2000 students from grade one to 13 and more than 100 teachers. The syllabus is taught in Tamil medium and English medium. 30 students entered the university in 2017. The principal and parents made a request from the Education Minister to expand the number of classrooms. They proposed to construct an old building and make it a four storey high building so that additional classrooms can be accommodated.
