Lake House Aloka Pooja - 2018
‘The Buddha’s teachings  illumine a path of virtue’

King Dharmasoka's eldest son Arahath Mahinda and the Buddhist entourage visited Mihintale 2,326 years ago to endow us with Buddhism. At the foot of the Aradhana Gala, King Devanampiya Tissa and his army who were deer-hunting, were enlightened by the Buddha’s teachings. The king and his army laid down their weapons and set foot on a path of non-violence, Mihintale Raja Maha Viharadhipathi Ven. Walawahangunuwewa Dhammarathana Nayaka Thera said, while delivering an anusasana at the inauguration of the Lake House Poson Aloka Pooja which commenced on June 26 with the cooperation of the Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB).
The nayaka thera said it was unfortunate that certain Buddhists had limited the festival to a mere form of entertainment. He said he wished that the 2,326th National Poson pinkama (2,326th mihindu jayanthi), would be a lesson for wayward Buddhists.
Higher Education and Cultural Affairs Minister Dr. Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe, the chief guest at the Lake House Mihintale Aloka Pooja inauguration ceremony, said the Buddhist community would be grateful to Lake House founder late D. R. Wijewardane.

The government had paid special attention to restore Mihintale's past glory by renovating a large number of Buddhist monuments scattered in a land area spanning 600 acres, he said.
President Maithripala Sirisena and the Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe inaugurated the Mihintale illumination programme yesterday. Anuradhapura Government Agent R. M. Wanninayake along with the Mihintale Divisional Secretary, executive officials attached to agencies contributing to the aloka pooja's pinkama programme and CEB officials, would inaugurate the final day of the aloka pooja today.
A large crowd of devotees witnessed the Mihintale Mihindu Perahera that commenced on June 26 evening at the historic Mihintala Raja Maha Viharaya. Government Agent Wanninayake inaugurated the event by placing a Sacred Relic on the back of a tusker.
According to police, around 600,000 devotees had visited Anuradhapura and Mihintale since June 26. Anuradhapura Senior Superintendent of Police Thilina Hapuarachchi told the Daily News that 2,800 police officers were placed on special Poson duty, adding that 120 officers attached to the Police Life-Saving Squad were stationed at major water sources.
