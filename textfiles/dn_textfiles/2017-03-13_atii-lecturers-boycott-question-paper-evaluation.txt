ATII lecturers boycott question paper evaluation

Lecturers of Sri Lanka Institute of Advanced Technological Education - ATII Academics’ Union throughout the island have decided to boycott evaluation of question papers from March 8.
The decision was taken by the Trade Union of the academic staff to urge the authorities to rectify the anomaly in the salaries and other allowances lagging for years.
ATII Academics’ Union President Ishar Ali said previous and the present governments failed to resolve the anomaly in the salaries and other allowances of the staff members. Responsibility for all the consequences arising from this trade union action should be borne by the subsequent governments that have failed to straighten up these anomalies.
“We request the present government to solve this problem as soon as possible so that the students will not beleaguered. All 270 staff members have refrained from marking papers and if this marking process delayed the students won’t be able to apply for courses on time. The trade union action will create an impact on issuing result of students, enrolment of new students and recruitment for the existing vacancies,” he said.
ATII Academics’ Union Secretary D. M. T. Chandika said, “The trade union action is carried out in 18 advanced technological institutes in Colombo, Dehiwala, Galle, Gampaha, Kandy, Jaffna and Ampara. Total number of answer scripts to be evaluated exceeds 125,000. About 21,000 students are studying in these institutes.
“We have held many discussions with the Higher Education Minister. Although they promise to solve this problem, it remains in its initial stage. Although, State Minister Mohan Lal Grero agreed in August 2016 to pay a Rs. 10,000 allowance per month using the funds earned by the advanced technological institute until the problem is resolved, that too has not materialized,” he said.
“There have been letter circulating among Department of Management Services, Education Ministry, National Salaries Commission, University Grants Commission for the last three years without any result. Our Trade Union has no faith in the National Salaries Commission as they have not responded to this problem for many years.
"We have taken this trade union action so as to make an impact on the government and we expect to continue trade union action,” he said.
“Nearly 21,000 students were studying in these institutes in 2016. This is the only institute for the A/L students who do not get an opportunity to enter the universities and these students are enrolled based on the A/C results. Last 86 students with 3 As have registered at the Dehiwala institute,” he said.
