Over thirty two Heads of Government and high-level delegates are scheduled to attend the ISA Conference. Sri Lanka became a founding member of the International Solar Alliance (ISA) on 12 February 2018.
The major objective of the International Solar Alliance, is to enable better harnessing of solar energy as an alternative energy source, and to address the specific solar technology deployment needs, of solar resource rich countries, located between the Tropic of Cancer and the Tropic of Capricorn.
The ISA, by this initiative, further aims to address the gaps in the solar energy manufacturing eco-system and to ensure universal energy access, energy equity, and affordability that are common issues facing most of the solar resource rich countries.
The Government of Sri Lanka joined the ISA in keeping with its policy declaration to prepare the groundwork for the country to fulfill the basic energy requirements of the people through renewable energy sources.
