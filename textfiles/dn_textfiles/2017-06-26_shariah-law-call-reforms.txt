Shariah law : A call for reforms

As we celebrate Eid-Ul-Fitr this year, we look into one of the most contemporary issues affecting the Muslim Community—the need to reform the Muslim Marriage and Divorce Act of 1951.
The article below tackles one of the most important issues of Muslim divorce; maintenance and the need to have equitable maintenance in the aftermath of separation.
The MMDA is the enactment which governs and regulate the marriage and divorce among the Muslims of Sri Lanka. Sec. 47 (1) of the MMDA empowers the Quazis to inquire and adjudicate the following matters related to pecuniary claims;
a) Any claim by a wife for a recovery of Mahar
b) Any claim for maintenance by or on behalf of a wife.
c) Any claim by divorced wife for maintenance until the registration of the divorce or during her period of Iddat.
d) Any claim for to increase or reduction of the amount of any maintenance.
e) Any claim for Kaikuli
f) Any claim by a wife for her lying in expenses. These provisions abundantly show that a Quazi has unlimited jurisdiction to hear claims of a wife in respect of compensations and related matters. The MMDA is silent regarding compensations (Mata) to divorced women who are deprived of any alimony, in the event of being divorced arbitrarily by their husbands.
In the light of the practical problems and the plight faced by the poor divorced Muslim women, it is appropriate to find some remedy compatible with the tenets of Shariah.
Quranic reasoning
It is befitting to see the holy Quran for guidance in this respect. The holy Quran in the following instances reiterates as follows:-
Chapter - 2, Verse 229:
‘’……….. The parties should either hold together on equitable terms or separate with kindness. It is not lawful for you (men) to take back any of your gifts (from your wives).
Chapter - 2, Verse 236:
There is no blame on you if ye divorced woman before consummation or the fixation of their dower; but bestow on them (a suitable gift) the wealthy man according to his means. A gift of a reasonable amount is due from those who wish to do the right thing.
Chapter - 2, Verse 237:
‘’And if you divorce them…… then the half of the dower is due to them, unless they remit it or the man’s half is remitted…….. And the remission of the man’s half is the nearest to righteousness. And do not forget liberality between yourselves, for Allah sees well all that you do.
Chapter - 2, Verse 241:
‘’For the divorced women is a suitable gift. This is a duty on the righteous.
Chapter - 4, Verse 20:
‘’But if you decide to take one wife in place of another, even if you had given the latter a whole treasure for dower, take not the least bit of it back, would you mean it a slander and a manifest sin. The above Quranic verses amply show that the Shariah expects benevolence and righteousness from a Muslim husband when he divorces his wife and promotes and approve payment of gifts in the form of compensation to the divorced wife.
Islamic Schools of thought
This concept is further illustrated by the Imaams, Scholars and theologians, who interpret the same in favour of Mata in the following manner;
“Among the Shafies, a present is incumbent on the husband in every case of separation, when the right to the dower has once vested in the woman, it is not defeated or lost by any conduct on her part,” says Mohammedan Law Vol. 2, page 404, Ameer Ali.
“On divorce and apart, altogether from the payment of Mahar, the husband shall make a gift to the divorced wife; this payment is to compensate her for her lost consortium and is based on the text of the holy Quran 2:236,” says Muhammadan Law -Fyzee.
Quran chapter -2 229 says ‘’The Arab husbands frequently despoiled their wives, and turned them adrift on the world, absolutely helpless and without means. These acts of injustice were expressly forbidden by the Quranic teachings. It was declared to the Arabs: If you separate yourself from your wives, send them away with generosity; it is not permitted to you to appropriate the goods you have once given to them.”
“Under the Islamic system, there is no community of goods between husband and wife, she is absolute owner of her own property and of whatever the husband settles on her as dower,” states Mohammedan Law vol. 2, page 423, Ameer Ali.
‘’In Syria, Tunisia and Morocco legislation had been enacted to check the power of unilateral divorce and imposed on the husband the liability to pay to the divorced wife an additional indemnity by way of compensation,” states Tunisia Code of personal status -1956 - Syrian law of personal status - 1953 - Moroccan Code of personal status 1958……. Shariah the Islamic law-Abdur Rahman I Doi.
In India, Muslim Women (protection of right of Divorce) Act 1986 has been enacted to provide compensation to the divorced wife.
Decided cases; Bai Thahira vs Ali Hussain AIR 1979 S/C 362 and in Tamil Nadu, Wakf Board vs Seyed Fathima Nachchi AIR 1995 Mds 88, was held by the Madras Supreme Court; the Wakf Board had to pay maintenance to the claimant wife.
In Sahihul Buhary, it is reported in vol. 3, page 229-230, by Umar Bin Abdul Azees(Rah), ‘’If the husband and wife exchanged gifts between them, it is not permitted to take back any of the gift.”
‘’The wife is entitled to maintenance from her husband although she may have the means to maintain herself and although her husband may be without means,” states Tyabji 289(1)(C). In Sri Lanka, MMDA does not make any provision for the award of ‘Mata’ though the holy Quran permits, encourages and provides the payment of a gift to the divorced wife. But instead it is very unfortunate that ‘Kaikuli’ has entered into the system of Muslim marriages in Sri Lanka with legal recognition.
Kaikuli is a form of dowry from the bride to the bride-groom which is anathema to Shariah law. Shariah enjoins husband provide Mahar to wife, when marriage is contracted and not vice-versa. The concept of Kaikuli would have entered in to our law books due to the influence of South Indian culture prevailed at the time of the enactment of the said Act.
There are also practical difficulties of enforcing an order of Mata payment, by a Quazi who uses his discretion, due to non-availability of provisions in MMDA in this regard. This would be a salutary piece of provision if Mata is introduced to the MMDA in keeping with equity and in fairness to an estranged, victimized divorced wife. At the same time the legitimate fair interest of the husband also have to be considered, as he may be taken into ransom and victimized by the divorced wife, who may differ her second marriage to receive the monthly maintenance, while leading an immoral life against Shariah.
In conclusion, it is stressed that it may be pertinent that the committee appointed to make recommendations of reforms to the existing Muslim Laws, shall take steps to remedy this lacuna in the law and in this regard consult the learned ulamas, scholars and legal practitioners to introduce necessary amendments to the Muslim Marriage and Divorce Act, within the tenets and acceptance to the Shariah Law.
