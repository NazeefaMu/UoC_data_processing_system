Embilipitiya paper factory to be reopened soon

The Embilipitiya Paper factory that remained closed for many years will be opened soon. The factory was set up in 1975 at Kadurugasaara in Embilipitiya and since 2002, it has been closed.
The factory produced about 25 percent of the country’s paper requirement and provided jobs to thousands in and around Embiipitiya.
The factory provided about 2,600 direct and 2,000 indirect employments. It lies on a 700 acres of land.
A team led by Hela Urumaya General Secretary and Embilipitiya Sri Bodhi Raja Viharaya Viharadipathi Ven.Omalpe Sobitha Thera have taken steps to reopen the factory.
Former Manager of the factory Asoka Subasinha said he assumed duties at the factory in 1975 when it was in profit. The factory should be opened to provide employments to jobless youths,” he said.
