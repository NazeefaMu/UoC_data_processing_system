FCID seeks AG’s advice on Namal Rajapaksa

 
The Financial Crimes Investigation Division (FCID) of the Police conducting investigations against Hambantota District MP Namal Rajapaksa concerning a misappropriation of Rs.70 million belonging to Krrish Company today informed Court that they have sought Attorney General’s advice regarding possible future legal action into the matter.
 
Accordingly, Colombo Fort Magistrate Lanka Jayaratne sent a reminder to the Attorney General directing him to expedite his advice regarding the case. The case will be taken up again on December 15.
 
MP Namal Rajapaksa was arrested for allegedly misappropriating Rs.70 million granted by Indian Real Estate Company Krish Lanka Pvt. Ltd, for the development of rugby in Sri Lanka. He is currently out on bail.
 
The FCID alleged that Krish Lanka Pvt. Ltd had granted Rs. 70 million for the development of rugby in Sri Lanka and the amount was given to Ceylon Premium Sports President Nihal Hemasiri Perera.
 
The FCID said Krish Company had remitted the money to a HSBC bank account belonging to Nihal Hemasiri Perera and he had later given the money to Rajapaksa on two occasions.
 
The FCID alleged that the complaint by Voice Against Corruption Convenor Wasantha Samarasinghe had alleged that the money granted by Krish Company had been misappropriated by the suspect without utilising them for the real purpose of the company.
