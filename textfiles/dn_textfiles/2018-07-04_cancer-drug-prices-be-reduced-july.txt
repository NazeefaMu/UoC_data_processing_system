Cancer drug prices to be reduced in July

Prices of expensive cancer drugs will be reduced this month (July), Health Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne said.
Minister Senaratne had stated that he will reduce the prices of expensive cancer drugs and the maximum price of the least expensive cancer drug will be Rs. 64,000. The Minister was speaking at the opening of the new Nutrition House in Ingiriya yesterday.
Minister Senaratne said that the price of a cancer drug which cost Rs. 285,000 in the past has been brought down to Rs. 144,000.
In the past, cancer patients died because they did not have money to buy the required drugs. But people thought they died because there were no drugs. In the past, only a limited amount of money (Rs. 1.5 million) was spent on one cancer patient, but now there is no such limit, he added.
