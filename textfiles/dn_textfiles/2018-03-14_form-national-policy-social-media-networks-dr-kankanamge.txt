Form national policy for social media networks-Dr Kankanamge

The government should form a national policy on social media networks by taking into consideration the views of the general public, said Chairman, Sri Lanka Trade Development Council and Founder President, Colombo Chamber of Commerce, Dr. Amila Kankanamge.
“Our observations revealed a serious delay in the maneuvering of government and security forces in controlling and suppressing the recent chaotic situation in the Kandy administrative region. The violent uproars and unanticipated behavior of users on social media platforms escalated the existing crisis to a more intense one,” he added.
“We believe the decision taken by the government to temporarily suspend all social media activity is timely as it led to the mitigation of further violence triggered by aggressive extremist ideas shared on all social media platforms.
We express our appreciation for the measures taken by the government.
“In proceeding, we propose to advance the positive outcome achieved by the Government in this scenario to a more dignified platform by taking action to eradicate the current ban on social media, under strict supervision.”
Meanwhile Minister of Telecommunication, Digital Infrastructure and Foreign Employment, Harin Fernando has indicated that the restriction on social media and messaging platforms will most probably be lifted by this Friday .
