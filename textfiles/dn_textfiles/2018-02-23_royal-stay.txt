A Royal Stay

The Galle Face Hotel is one of Colombo’s most iconic institutions. For over a century and half, the landmark hotel has set the bar for luxury accommodation and is the preferred choice for guests.
The hotel has a long-standing history of hosting prominent visitors, counting among them Sir Arthur C. Clarke, John D. Rockefeller, Carrie Fisher and Indira Gandhi to name a few.
Recently, the hotel was home to their Royal Highnesses The Earl and Countess of Wessex. The Earl and Countess were on the island to take part in the celebration of Sri Lanka’s 70th anniversary of independence.
Their Royal Highnesses had an enjoyable stay surrounded by the rich history and heritage of the Galle Face Hotel.
Celebrating 150 years, the Galle Face Hotel is one of the landmarks in Asia and was acclaimed as one of the best heritage Hotels in Sri Lanka in 2012. Further it is the first Hotel in the country to be featured on a postage stamp.
