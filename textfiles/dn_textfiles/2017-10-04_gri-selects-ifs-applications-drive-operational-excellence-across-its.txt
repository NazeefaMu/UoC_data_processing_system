GRI selects IFS Applications to drive operational  excellence across its global organization

IFS, the global enterprise applications company, announces that Sri Lankan specialist tire manufacturer, Global Rubber Industries (Pvt) Ltd (GRI), has chosen to implement IFS Applications™ as its central enterprise resource planning (ERP) system.
GRI was founded in 2002 and has since grown into Sri Lanka’s largest specialist tire manufacturer with over 600 employees who support customers in over 50 countries.
In order to support its growth ambitions, GRI needed to improve visibility throughout its value chain, from procuring raw materials to delivering finished-goods, in order to improve planning and accommodate fluctuations in global demand.
Following an extensive evaluation process comprising of all major tier-one ERP vendors, IFS Applications was selected for its capabilities, modern architecture and the company’s successful track record in the industrial manufacturing sector.
IFS Applications will be deployed and rolled out across the organization to give management a complete view of resources and performance that will enable quick and accurate decision-making.
The solution will support business-critical processes such as production and planning, finance, procurement, sales and marketing, quality management, maintenance and document management.
“We were impressed with the capabilities of IFS Applications, its vast array of local and global customer references as well as industry analysts’ confidence in the solution.
It was clear to us that IFS Applications was the most fitting solution to achieve our objectives,” said GRI Managing Director Prabhash Subasinghe.
He said, “As global tire manufacturers are faced with volatile pricing in raw materials such as rubber, it is extremely important that we are able to plan for fluctuations in customer demand, changes in material prices and availability of materials, all simultaneously, while working to meet strict timelines for product shipments.
In addition to this, as competition increases in an expanding global marketplace, it is necessary for manufacturers to monitor and respond accordingly to competitor behavior, specifically to pricing, promotions and discounts.
Having the right information to hand through IFS Applications will provide GRI with the ability to operate proactively, and therefore be able to provide its customers with highly efficient and effective products and service. We therefore look forward to the rapid implementation of this platform, along with a fruitful collaboration with IFS.”
Jayantha De Silva, President and CEO for IFS in Sri Lanka, said, “It is with pleasure that we embark on this implementation project together with Global Rubber Industries (Pvt) Limited (GRI).
We are confident that IFS’s technology will bring about great improvements in efficiency, as well as greater visibility and integrity throughout the company’s operations.
IFS fully understands business challenges associated with such a large-scale implementation and our team has extensive experience in helping clients in both the rubber and industrial manufacturing industries.
We are confident with this expertise,best practices and strong local presence that we will deliver an outstanding solution that will meets the high standards of GRI.”
