SLTU protests Uva CM’s reappointment

Once schools reopen next week, Sri Lanka Teachers’ Union (SLTU) plans to engage in a trade union action against the decision taken to reappoint Uva Province Chief Minister Chamara Sampath Dassanayake as the Provincial Education Minister again.
SLTU Secretary Joseph Stalin told the Daily News that the reappointment is unethical since the investigations into the alleged charges of the chief minister are still being carried out.
The chief minister is facing charges of having made the Badulla Tamil Maha Vidyalaya Principal kneel before him, for not accepting a letter given by him for the admission of a student to that school. The chief minister, who surrendered to the Badulla Police in connection with this charge, was later granted bail after being produced before the Badulla District Court.
Stalin added that the reappointment is unjust and unethical as the chief minister is still on bail and the case is still being heard at courts. Besides, the investigation of the Education Ministry has not yet come to the end. The report of the Human Right Commission in connection with the incident is also pending. Moreover, the report of the committee appointed by the Uva Provincial Governor has not been finalised yet.
“At this juncture, this reappointment is a great injustice for the whole teacher and principal community.”
He added that the SLTU had requested the President to cancel the reappointment until the investigations are finished.
“If we don’t receive a favourable response, the SLTU will launch a trade union action in this regard once the school are reopened,” he said.
