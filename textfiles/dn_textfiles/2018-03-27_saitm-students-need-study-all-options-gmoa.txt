SAITM students need to study all options - GMOA

All solutions proposed for SAITM students should be given to them for their consideration without forcing them to select one (KDU) of the set of solutions, Government Medical Officers' Association (GMOA) Secretary Dr. Haritha Aluthge said.
Addressing a press conference held at the GMOA Headquarters in Colombo yesterday, he said that the GMOA along with all the other parties presented a set of solutions, including KDU, for SAITM students, considering their different levels of qualifications. Now it is revealed that there are unqualified (who do not have minimum qualifications) students among SAITM students.
According to Dr. Aluthge, all qualified SAITM students should be given KDU MBBS and not an MBBS connected to the name of a closed-down illegal institution. They should be able to register themselves with the Sri Lanka Medical Council (SLMC). All SAITM students should be given one solution. Different solutions should not be given to sections of SAITM students.
The gazette notification in connection with closing down SAITM should be issued at the same time when the students enroll in KDU. SAITM should not be combined with KDU. The Cabinet paper should be based on the set of solutions given by all parties and it should not be distorted according to the requirements of the University Grants Commission (UGC) Chairman. Therefore amendments to the current Cabinet paper are essential. The concerned parties in the issue request an opportunity to meet the President to present more facts, he added.
