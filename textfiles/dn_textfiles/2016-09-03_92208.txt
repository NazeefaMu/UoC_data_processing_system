Convention will strengthen SLFP - President

President Maithripala Sirisena said the 65th anniversary of the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) would strengthen the party’s will to remain in the national unity government.
“We have to forget our greed for power and remain united to create a better country for the next generation,” the President said, while addressing a meeting with newspaper editors and media at the President’s House, last morning. He said the national unity government should be strengthened to resolve several key issues, including the repayment of foreign debts amounting to Rs. 9000 billion.
He said the national unity government, in which the two main political parties function as the key stakeholders, lays the perfect foundation to find solutions to long-drawn socio-economic issues.
Commenting on differences of opinion within the SLFP over the convention, the President said all the right thinking MPs of the party would attend the convention and show their solidarity.
He also expressed confidence that the SLFP seniors would resolve their internal issues, amicably, through negotiations.
“At the convention, we will make some important decisions on the party’s future course of action and internal reforms,” the President revealed.
When asked about the recent remark he made on “revealing secrets” involving party dissidents, the President said it had nothing to do with cases of bribery and corruption.
“Those are just political secrets and nothing more! One has to understand that they are not ‘files’. For instance, when I addressed a commemorative event of the late Jeyaraj Fernandopulle recently, I revealed some secrets about the previous government. That was what I meant when I made this remark at the political rally in Matara,” the President explained.
