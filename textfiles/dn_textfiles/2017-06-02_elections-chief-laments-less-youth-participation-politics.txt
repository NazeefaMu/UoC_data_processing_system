Elections Chief laments less youth participation in politics

There are no laws to hold by-elections when an incumbent politician dies, resigns or becomes ineligible to continue in office, Elections Commission Chairman Mahinda Deshapriya said.
Addressing the "National Voters' Day 2017" event held at the Colombo University Law Faculty yesterday, he said measures are taken to strengthen the electoral system.
"But no where I see initiatives taken to hold by-elections. I have no idea whether there are proposals to include it in the proposed new Constitution," he said.
Deshapriya said the significance of celebrating National Voters Day is to encourage young voters to take part in the political process. He stressed the importance of youth participation in the electoral process.
"Universal franchise is a civic right. Sovereignty of the people certified by the Constitution could be exercised through franchise. It is mandatory to have the name in the electoral register to exercise franchise. It is a civic right and also a responsibility to insert names in the electoral register and to exercise franchise,"he said.
He said even though youth try to refrain from politics blaming the government and politicians for every action, they have to understand that some or the other way, everything is interconnected. Participation of responsible voters are required to form a good and a responsible government, he said.
Deshapriya said in India, there was a request to include 'None Of The Above" (NOTA) in the ballet papers to show their dislike for candidates. The public didn't want to cancel their votes but to express their displeasure. The Indian Supreme Court agreed to include NOTA in the ballet papers.
He said the topic is being discussed and added that he neither encourages nor discourages it.
"One of the questions from the youth is why we dont have it in Sri Lanka. But it has to come through the public and Parliament. It has to be legally accepted," he said.
He said responsible voting should be encouraged among the public especially the youth. He said there is less representation of the youth in Parliament and added that the youth are not interested in getting involved in political activities.
Deshapriya said it is important to elect most suitable and talented candidates.
