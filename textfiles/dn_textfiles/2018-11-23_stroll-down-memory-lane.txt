Stroll down memory lane

The Ladies College - Class of ’72 reunion this year was a day away at Villa ‘Minnehaha’ on the idyllic shores of Deduwa Lake in Bentota. The name Minnehaha or ‘laughing water’ in Longfellow’s epic poem the Song of Hiawatha comes to mind as a fitting title to this magnificent property.
This year’s organisers of the batch reunion were Ruwani J, Shanthi D and Sharmini R, who put together a ‘fun package’ for the day away with great panache!
We began our journey in Colombo and cruised along the Southern expressway to leave at some point to navigate skinny and winding roads passing swathes of paddy fields and serene countryside to reach our destination which abuts Bawa’s famous Country Estate Lunuganga. Finally, as we reached the end of the track with great anticipation ‘voila’ there she was fair maiden Minnehaha or ‘Laughing Waters’ beaming and beckoning us.
We scrambled eagerly out of the vehicles to walk down the well-appointed, open plan, magnificent Villa. Minnehaha stood majestically on beautifully landscaped gardens at the edge of an expanse of tranquil waters surrounded by dense thickets. The stillness and the silence engulfing theawe inspiring scenery was heavenly as we stood still in that ‘soul touching’ moment to breathe-in deeply and savour the ‘feel’ of our salubrious surroundings complete with the smells, the sounds, the sightsof nature’s wonderful gift to humanity.
The shrill cry of a kingfisher piercing the stillness brought us back to earth and we were warmly greeted by our lovely hostess Nelum with welcome drinks of fresh thambili with opaque tender kernel swirling like clouds in highball glasses and a ruby red melon juice with a hint of lime were delightfully refreshing.
The girls were on a natural ‘high’ meeting and greeting one another like long lost friends with great enthusiasm whilst stretching their limbs after the journey and exploring the generous space of the Villa and its landscaped gardens. Having settled in comfortably, our school day cravings and a ‘fix’ of a sort of spicy amba achcharu with a twist of sharp and sweet flavours, was passed around generously for those who still had the teeth for it, and the squeals of delight at the sight of now rarely seen, hard to buy and hard to bite Bulto - a deep brown sticky toffee that virtually delivered a locked jaw when chewed upon! Nevertheless these were relished with great fervor whilst walking down memory lane,avidly talking of tuck shop days.
Asmid-day approached and the adventurous having had a dip in the emerald waters of the pool to cool off, and a few lucky ones enjoying a boat ride in the lake, the irresistible aroma of food wafted through the air guaranteeing a delicious meal; we were hungry. Nelum had planned meticulously and prepared a delicious meal with Baby Nona her capable cook the daunting task of appeasing thirty five discerning palates! As expected the table was laden with a sumptuous array of local delicacies in every form; curried, tempered, fried, sambals, sautés, pickles, chutneys and the lot and to top it all off, as in fully rich dessert with plentiful second helpings with no thought to boot for the expanding waistlines; we were stuffed.
In between the events of the day we still had time for excited chatter and swap news of children, grandchildren, concerns for husbands who were ailing with uplifting stories of making sweet lemonade when life threw lemons! We remembered with great affection and empathyour colleagues who have gone before us, notwithstanding the joys, celebrations, heartaches and hardships of our alumnae.
The class of ‘72 though scattered far and wide, their unity and diversity were a celebration; mellowed like fine wines and gourmet cheese with the passage of time and the diverse paths that each one uniquely travelled in their journey of life, these were women firmly grounded, intrinsically housewives and mothers, who laboured not so long ago to nurture and raise their young families juggling challenging careers. Now at sixty something years, these glamourous wives, mothers, aunts and doting grandmothers were reaping their reward and enjoying their labour of love believing that the best is yet to come!
