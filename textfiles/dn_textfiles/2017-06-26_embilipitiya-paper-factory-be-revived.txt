Embilipitiya paper factory to be revived

The Embilipitiya paper factory, believed to be the largest paper factory in Asia, set up at Kandurugasara in 1975, is today, in total neglect. Its machinery is rusting and its buildings are overtaken by jungle, following its decline set in motion in 2002.
Today, an organisation calling itself the ‘old friends’ of the paper factory, have teamed up under the patronage of Ven. Omalpe Sobhitha thera to revive and inject new blood to the factory which provided permanent employment to 2,600 and 2,000 casual employees.
Part of the 700-acre premises of the factory was occupied by unauthorised people and parts of machinery, doors and windows of the factory were removed by vandals.
Members of the new organisation are led by Ven. Vijeriye Sumana Thera and the factory’s Founder Manager Asoka Subasinghe. Former General Manager and Factory Manager M.A. Justin and Provincial Council member S.V.P. Ananda, who was a former factory employee, held an inaugural meeting at the Leisure Park reception hall at the Sri Lanka Army Camp Engineering School to map out their strategy.
Asoke Subasinghe said, he is shocked over the unfortunate fate of the factory which he left in 1978. He was prepared to assist any endeavour made towards reviving and rehabilitating this factory.
M.A. Justin said, they should make a genuine effort to revive the factory without blaming anyone about past mistakes. He said, the factory could be re-established by even obtaining a foreign loan. Since people were being weaned away from the habit of using polythene, the revived factory could be utilized to produce the country’s total requirement of paper bags.
