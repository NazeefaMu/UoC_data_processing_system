Poems

My Triumph lasted till the Drums
My Triumph lasted till the DrumsHad left the Dead aloneAnd then I dropped my VictoryAnd chastened stole alongTo where the finished FacesConclusion turned on meAnd then I hated GloryAnd wished myself were They.What is to be is best descriedWhen it has also been—Could Prospect taste of RetrospectThe tyrannies of MenWere Tenderer—divinerThe Transitive toward.A Bayonet’s contritionIs nothing to the Dead.
- Emily Dickinson

Stay Humble
Stay humble my friend.For you won't be here one day.And although you think you might have left a legacy,In due time it too will fade with you.You want to be remembered as someone whoWas kind.Loving.Respectful.Helpful.Friendly.And above all humble.So take the compliments nicely.Try to always be kind.And try to be forgiving.Although I know it can sometimes be hard.Help others.Stand up for one another.Because those are the true legacies that impact lives.Not just some material thing that will fade faster than you think.

DECENCY GUIDE AT THE RESTAURANT
Never click your fingers for the waiters,Being too loud is indecent,Do not let your child listen to videos on their phones,Blowing your nose on the napkin; never do.Never allow your child to play with cutleryCondiments are not to play,Leave a tip even a pittance,Don’t take the pictures of your meals,Flirting with waiters, an ugly scene,Wrong cutlery for the wrong use, never do.Making singing gestures for the bill, could deduct your marks!Talking with your mouth full, the ugliest of the scenes,Wiping hands on the table cloth, inexcusable to the hilt.‘Leave the place earning a good name.’
PIYADASA RILLAGODA

THE MAD BUFFALO
Drinking the muddy waterit declared:“I drink boiled filtered water”“Entry into the fieldsis forbidden!”It decreedHot mid- day sunThe buffalo’s madness worsenedIt applied soapbatheddried its head with flowers‘I don’t like dirty ones”It proclaimedand chased away the white cranesWho knows its speeches and photosmay appear in tomorrow’s papers!
