Right to Information Bill challenged in SC

 
A Special Determination petition was filed yesterday in the Supreme Court challenging the constitutionality of the Right to Information Bill.
The petition was filed by two Software Engineers - Benthara Gamage Indika Gamage of Nalanda and Gonsalge Isuru Buddhika Sirinimal of Uda Peradeniya.
The petitioners stated that a Bill titled "Right to Information Bill" was placed on the Order Paper of Parliament on or about March 24, 2016.
The petitioners stated that Clause 5(1) (c) (v) and Clause 5 (3) of the Bill are in contravention of the protection afforded to the petitioners in Articles 12 (1) and 14 (1) (g) of the Constitution.
The petitioners maintained that the concerned clause of the Bill is unconstitutional and could only be enacted as provided in Article 83 of the Constitution. They sought to declare that Clause 5 (1) (c) (v) and Clause 5 (3) of the Bill titled "Right to Information Bill" are in violation of Article 12 (1) and 14 (1) (g) of the Constitution.
They further sought to declare that Clause 5 (1) (c) (v) and clause 5 (3) of the Bill titled "Right to Information Bill" require passing by a 2/3rd majority of Parliament and approval of the People of the Democratic Republic of Sri Lanka at a referendum as provided in Article 83 of the Constitution.
