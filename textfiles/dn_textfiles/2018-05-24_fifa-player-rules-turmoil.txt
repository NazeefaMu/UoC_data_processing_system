FIFA player rules in turmoil

Brussels, Wednesday: Some of the most important football action of the summer could take place on Thursday not on a pitch but in a Belgium court and could transform the transfer market. More than two decades after the Bosman case created freedom of contract, ended nationality quotas and shifted power to the wealthiest clubs, a Brussels court will hear an appeal on third party ownership (TPO) of players, which is banned by football’s world governing body, FIFA.
TPO allows investors to hold a financial stake in players and cash in by taking a cut when they move between clubs during their careers in lucrative transfer deals. Critics say it deprives players of control over their careers and former UEFA president Michel Platini, now banned from football following a graft probe, called it “a type of slavery”.
Football authorities worry that involvement of third party owners with clubs creates conflicts of interest and favours clubs who can afford to form continuing relationships with agents or player owners.
Supporters claim it helps poorer clubs sign and develope young players and spreads the burden of transfer fees because they only buy part of the player’s registration. The current case was brought by Belgian third-division club Seraing which in January 2015 signed an agreement with investment fund Doyen Sports based on the potential returns from TPO. AFP
