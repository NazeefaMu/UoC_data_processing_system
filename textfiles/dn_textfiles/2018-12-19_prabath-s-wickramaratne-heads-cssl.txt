The CSSL was established in 1976 in Sri Lanka by a group of dedicated professionals for the purpose of promoting Information and Communication Technology (ICT) and professionalism among those engaged in this field, and to maintain the highest professional standards among the ICT professionals. CSSL has played this role for over 40 years and is the apex body for ICT professionals in Sri Lanka. It is a not-for-profit body.
The CSSL is best known in Sri Lanka for hosting the National IT Conference (NITC) which provides a platform for national and international speakers to present papers. CSSL also organizes the National Schools’ Software Competition (NSSC) as well as the popular IT MasterMind Television Quiz Show that is nationally televised on ITN.
These activities have collectively lead to a surge in popularity for the CSSL and also for a renewed energy in driving large projects for building awareness and capacity.
The CSSL also provides networking opportunities as well as workshops and seminars that are organized on a regular basis. One of the major achievements in the recent past is obtaining the Provisional Signatory status of Seoul Accord, which would assist to shape the dimensions of ICT higher education in Sri Lanka.
