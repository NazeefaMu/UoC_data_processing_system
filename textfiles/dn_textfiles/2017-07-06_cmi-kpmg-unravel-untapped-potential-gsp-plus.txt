Thus the objective of the event is to provide an overview of the opportunities to fully leverage the benefits of GSP Plus.”
The event will feature a presentation on the topic by M.P. T. Cooray, Secretary General, Joint Apparel Association Forum and Suresh R. I. Perera, Principal, Tax and Regulatory, KPMG, followed by an interactive panel discussion moderated by Reyaz Mihular, Managing Partner, KPMG.
