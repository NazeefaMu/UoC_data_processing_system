SAITM students need international recognition - Parent

An investigation is going on in the Bribery Commission in connection with SAITM.
We have already demanded a Presidential Commission on the same and forwarded a copy of the demand to the CID, SAITM Medical Students' Parents' Union Chairman Gemunu Wijeratne said.
Addressing a press conference held at the Organization of Professionals' Association auditorium in Colombo yesterday, he said that his son is in SAITM for seven long years by February 1st this year but the Cabinet Ministers are trying their best to save institutions and not 900 SAITM students.
According to Wijeratne, no SAITM student wants an illegal or fake MBBS. They are willing to sit for any examination. They need an Internationally recognized MBBS which is obtained from a recognized medical faculty that functions under the supervision of the SLMC and UGC.
They do not need a hybrid MBBS offered by a closed private medical faculty or fraudulent and low quality institution.
They need a recognized MBBS. It cannot be granted without drafting all relevant and required rules, regulations and legislatives with the active contribution of all relevant professionals and scholars, he said.
What this Government should do immediately is obtain the active contribution of the GMOA, SLMC and all the other relevant and required professionals and scholars to draft minimum standards of medical education and private medical faculties, he said.
Nothing will be successful without consulting the GMOA because they are responsible for providing clinical training for SAITM medical students, Wijeratne added.
