Bed bug menace at National Eye Hospital

Patients receiving residential treatment in several wards of the National Eye Hospital have been transferred to other wards due to bed bugs.
The patients and hospital staff have been inconvenienced due to bed bug menace and transfer of wards.
The Hospital’s Acting Director Dr.I.L.Mohomed Rifan said insecticides are applied about twice every year to control the spread of bed bugs after transferring the patients to other wards.
The hospital authorities have banned patients from bringing in mattresses, pillows and bed sheets to prevent the spread of bed bugs.
