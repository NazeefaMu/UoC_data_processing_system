Govt urged to honour promises

National Movement for Social Justice members said they will give the government two weeks to change its current path and keep the promises made to the people prior to coming into power.
Addressing the media in Colombo on Tuesday, Prof. Sarath Wijesuriya said offenders responsible for corruption, malpractice and murder are still not being investigated and punished as promised.
"In the past, former President Mahinda Rajapaksa intervened and now certain ministers are doing the same to prevent justice being meted out. Well disciplined officers have done their duties. Something or someone is blocking the process. The government should act according to the results of investigations. The order of the law and the independence of the judiciary should be protected," Prof. Wijesuriya said.
People's Collective Movement joint convenor Saman Ratnapriya said the government was not productive enough.
"Minister Wijayadasa Rajapakshe was still holding on to his position after safeguarding Avant Garde while the IGP was still in office despite his connections with the 'Sil Redi issue' and the Embilipitiya incident. The Attorney General had gone on leave prior to his retirement purposely avoiding his duties," he said.
