‘Farmers yet to receive fertiliser subsidies’

Fertiliser subsidies for farmers were not deposited in their bank accounts as promised by the government. If the government breach their promise further, farmers will launch another struggle after five days, All Island Farmers’ Alliance and Provincial Councillor Chairman Namal Karunarathna said.
He was addressing a press conference held at the Dambulla Siyapatha Hotel recently.
Karunarathna said the government is trying to suppress farmers' rights. He said the farmers have to struggle to gain their rights. "We made several protests to win our rights in the past and succeeded in gaining some of them. Another struggle will be launched to gain the fertiliser subsidies," he said.
He said sufficient rice and paddy stocks are available until next February. "The Auditor General’s report has proved it. But the stocks are remaining in private sector. The rice market has limited only to a few large -scale paddy millers.
The entire monopoly of rice market was grabbed by the private sector.
