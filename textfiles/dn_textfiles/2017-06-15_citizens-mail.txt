Citizens' Mail

Shining Balangoda
In a plateau surrounded by mountains. There’s city with a pleasant landscape with the breeze blowing through the trees.
It’s Balangoda, a gift of Mother Nature. No unpleasant atmosphere is here. You cannot see any garbage dumping in the street. No mosquitoes from the marshy land, nor flood from the nearby stream.
The main road and by paths are widened, giving no place for accidents. We are free from traffic jams. All the marshy lands are disappeared. Banks on either side of the stream have been developed preventing floods. Hence, no opportunity for soil erosion.
There are gardens nicely built where you can enjoy the pleasant nice breeze blowing through the garden trees. We do not feel any stress in our minds. Everything is given for health. The shopping complex with the bus stand and the weekly fair provide a chance for the community to transact leisurely.
We are fortunate to get the services of the solid waste management centre founded with the 3R concept. It has become an income earner for the Balangoda Urban Council. The Right to Know Information is protected by the Urban Council.
There’s an e-library to widen the knowledge of the readers well along with all these wonderful offerings of the infrastructure facilities.
The people can enjoy their healthy lives without having any mental stress. The administration of the council can be highly recommended. Everyone can get a quick and efficient service from the staff there.
We have a very good base hospital, well developed from time to time. Surgeries can be performed for the betterment of everyone.
We must give a very big thank to Balangoda Urban Council for developing the city to a greater extent with all the expected facilities.
