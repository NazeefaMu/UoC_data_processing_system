Citizens' Mail

Avoid unnecessary Govt. expenditures and help the poor!
I was shocked and dismayed to hear that a couple from Kahatagasdigiliya had been starving without food for many days and fed with ‘Murunga’ leaves. I think this disheartening act would have definitely grieved many of us who consume three belly full of meals every day. But none of us could help this starving couple was a misfortune.
I would like to reminisce here an anecdote in the history of Islam during the period of Caliph Omar, the second ruler of Arabia after Prophet Mohamed [Sal].
Once Caliph Omar thought of visiting around his kingdom on a monetary mission and set out his journey on his camel in a night. While he was on his way he heard some children were crying from a cottage. He accessed to the cottage and peeped through the hole of the door and saw a mother was boiling something in the pot and her three children squatting around her, crying. The sympathized Caliph tapped the door and the woman opened the door and he inquired why the children were crying.
The penurious woman retorted that her children were in extreme hunger and waiting to be fed before going to sleep. Again Caliph asked her what was she boiling in the pot. She said they were the seeds of dates, pretending that she was preparing food for them until they went to sleep. Caliph Omar was perturbed and astonished that there was severe poverty prevailing in his Kingdom.
Immediately, he rushed to his abode and brought wheat and other home needs and told the woman to prepare food and feed the children. The following day he reserved an amount of fund for poverty alleviation for the poor from the ‘Baithul Maal’ the Islamic state treasury. This anecdotic incident shows us how a ruler acted responsibly and humanely for the people of his beloved country.
However, I appreciate the President’s gesture of apologizing for this traumatic and grieving incident occurred in Khatagasdigiliya and deploying an official to look into the matter. It is quite timely and very much important for the president to launch a poverty alleviation programme immediately to help the poverty stricken and down trodden people of Sri Lanka, avoiding unnecessary Government expenditures.
