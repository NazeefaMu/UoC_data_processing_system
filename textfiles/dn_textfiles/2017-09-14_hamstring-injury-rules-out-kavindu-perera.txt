Hamstring injury rules out Kavindu Perera

Asian Sevens rugby series - 2nd leg in South Korea:
Dashing Sri Lanka and CR & FC wing three quarter Kavindu Perera has been ruled out of the Asian Rugby Sevens Series 2nd leg in South Korea due to a hamstring injury.
Perera will most probably be available for the third leg that will take place at the Racecourse International Stadium in Colombo next month.
The Sri Lanka squad started practices under the leadership of former Thomian cum granite number eight Sudarshana Muthuthanthri with the inclusion of Navy SC player Chanaka Chandimal, who missed the first leg due to chicken pox infection along with Kandy SC players Srinath Sooriyabandara, Richard Dharmapala and Danushka Ranjan. All four players missed the 1st leg of the tournament in Hong Kong due to sickness and injuries.
Sri Lanka finished 5th in the 1st leg of the Asian Sevens Series behind winners Japan, runners up Hong Kong, third placed South Korea and fourth placed China.
