Tax relief measures cost government dearly

The Government will lose over Rs 50,000 million annually by the budgetary decision to reduce taxes, Tax Consultant P. Guruge said.
The government has taken measures with Budget 2016 to reduce taxes aiming to provide relief to the public and ease the cost of living burden.
Guruge added that this is the largest tax relief in the history of the country's budget.
"However, it is regrettable that a few opposition members, who cry that the government has increased taxes through the budget, cannot see this situation. They cannot see that the government stands to lose millions through the decision of tax reduction with a view bring relief to the people" he noted.
He further said the government will lose Rs 25,000 million by lifting VAT and Rs 6,000 million by reduction of Company Tax. The government will lose another Rs 8,000 million by the reduction of withholding tax on interest. The government will lose another Rs 7,500 million through all the other reductions and abolishing of taxes bringing a total amount of Rs 50,800 million annually.
Guruge noted that the tax relief limit for a person was Rs. 500,000 while the limit for an employee was Rs 750,000 so far. But, the tax relief limit has been increased to Rs 2.4 million with this budget.
"Why has the opposition failed to understand the extent of relief granted by the government for tax payers?," he questioned.
