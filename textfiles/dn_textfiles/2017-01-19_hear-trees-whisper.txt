Hear the trees whisper!

Architect Shobha Senaviratna’s strength as an architect comes from her understanding of nature. She is truly a gifted architect in this respect. Having had the opportunity to work with Architect Minnette de Silva, the first female to be trained as an architect in Sri Lanka, Senaviratna has 26 years of professional work experience.
“When beginning the process of a design, in addition to gathering data from the client about his or her lifestyles and requirements (the client’s brief) and the site requirements, we have to identify the energies available at the site and existing trees - the cosmic energy or the positive energies. We are part of nature. When constructing buildings we should not harm nature. Natural disasters are a result of destroying nature. When disrupting nature, the bio diversity is affected. Therefore, we need to visit the site and identify these things,” said Senaviratna.
In the good old days, people used to call it Vastu. Vastu mostly considers the energy. First of all, we have to find a good place to live. There should be a lot of positive energy. Mainly the source of cosmic energy is the sun.
“You need to bring positive energy into your interior space. You can do this in the orientation of your house. When designing according to spaces, you have to consider how you are going to get natural energy into the interior spaces,” stated Senaviratna.
An architect analyzes site data and client requirements, and comes to a conclusion. They develop a theme or concept depending on the information. Then you know the ingredients for the house.
“We develop the theme and then decide on what kind of line types, colours, textures and shapes you need to get the form, define the shape or the spaces that is done by the lines. It can be two dimensional or it can be three dimensional. For lines, there is a psychology. For example if there are horizontal lines, it is more calming and relaxing. When you have more horizontal lines it is more relaxing. When the lines are curvy or wavy, it is more nature-friendly,” pointed out Senaviratna.

You can define something only through the lines. For example, even when you consider fashion, tall people should never wear vertical lines. That makes them appear taller. Short people should never wear horizontal lines because then you’ll feel shorter. That expresses many things. This applies not only to lines but even to colours.
There is a psychology to colours as well.
“There are three types of colours, cool colours, warm colours and neutral colours. Warm colours are red, yellow and orange. They are highly intensive and visually attractive. Cool colours are green, blues and purples. They are visually less attractive. When you have neutral colours, you feel relaxed. When you have a lot of red, you feel very warm,” explained Senaviratna.
Nature colours are cool colours such as the blue sky and the green environment. In nature, greens and blues dominate. But for a sign on the road, we use warm colours to emphasize something. It stands out well rather than a cool colour or a neutral colour.
“For example Ruwanwelisaya Dagabe is completely white. The sky is blue and the background is lush green. It stands out very well. White is a neutral colour according to colour psychology; a certain peacefulness is expressed. Just imagine Ruwanwelisaya in red!” added Senaviratna.
With concept analysis, an architect will be aware of the kind of line types he or she has to use. The second thing is the finishes. The surface quality matters a lot. Everything has to be considered.
“We do everything according to client requirements and our understanding of the Client Brief. Once we get the proper concept or theme, we will know the kind of colours, line types, textures and finishes are necessary for the spaces. That is the point we start our design,” said Senaviratna.
Architecture is not only about arranging spaces. It is all about connecting nature and buildings - the interior and exterior. Even though my house is in a housing scheme, I don’t feel that we are in a housing scheme because it is connected to nature.
Moana is one of Senaviratna’s favourite movies because it is all about nature! She pointed out that if people don’t respect each other, how will they respect nature?
“Though trees cannot speak, they can hear us! I am telling you this seriously. It is not a myth. For example, when they were constructing Ruwanwelisaya, there was a huge tree. And there is a god presiding over that tree. Before constructing Ruwanwelisaya, they had to receive permission from the spirit presiding over that tree. Those days before cutting any tree you have to get permission from the spirit presiding,” informs Senaviratna.
Trees can hear us. Definitely, why not? She enthusiastically points out.
“There was an orange tree that was almost dying in the land I purchased recently. I refurbished the house. We wanted to have more garden rather than the house. So I touched the tree and prayed for it. I watered it and looked after it well because I love that tree so much. I was so thrilled to see it responding. Even animals, though they can’t speak, they can feel,” shares Senaviratna.
With regard to architecture, most people think that these are just a few lines and spaces. But it is more than that.
“With humans there are Chakras. This is famous in Hinduism and Buddhism. You get the Crown Chakras, Eye Chakra, Throat Chakra and Heart Chakra. You have knowledge and I have knowledge. I have qualifications and I can say I am an architect. If you have the knowledge and not the wisdom, then how can you apply that knowledge? Wisdom is the most important thing. Wisdom comes from the Crown Chakra and the colour of the Crown Chakra is blue. It is a cool colour. Even when you are designing, when you are discussing with a client with our experience, we can grab what they want for their house. We can see that. Then we advise them,” believes Senaviratna.
