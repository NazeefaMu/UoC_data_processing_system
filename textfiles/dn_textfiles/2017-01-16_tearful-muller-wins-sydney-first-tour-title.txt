Tearful Muller wins in Sydney for first tour title

SYDNEY: An emotional Gilles Muller clinched a first ATP Tour title in his 17th year as a professional when he beat Briton Dan Evans 7-6(5) 6-2 to win the Sydney International on Saturday.
The 33-year-old left-hander from Luxembourg had lost all five of his previous tour finals but prevailed at the sixth attempt in the Australian Open warm-up event at the Olympic Tennis Centre.
Muller raised his arms aloft in triumph after converting his third championship point off his second serve to conclude the final in a shade under an hour-and-a-half on Ken Rosewall Arena.
“Wow, what a night, I’ve waited a long time for this,” the world number 34 said after receiving the trophy from Australian tennis great Rod Laver.
“I’m sorry,” he added, fighting in vain to hold back the tears.
“It just means so much to me to win the first time on the ATP in front of my boys and my wife.”
Evans, ranked in the high 700s in the world only a couple of years ago but destined to hit a career high 51 on Monday, was also seeking a first Tour title but failed to come to terms with the variety of Muller’s serve.
