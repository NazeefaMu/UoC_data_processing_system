NDB Shilpa supports Grade Five Scholarship students

The year five scholarship exam is perceived as a landmark hurdle by students and parents alike. Since the examination opens doors for students to enter esteemed national schools; it has become one of the most competitive examinations faced by school children.
‘NDB Shilpa’, a versatile solution to help build the dreams of the aspiring younger generation of the country, joined hands as main sponsor for a series of educational programmes initiated by Sirasa FM for the second consecutive year.
These seminars are conducted during the past years in a view to support little ones who are preparing themselves for the upcoming Grade five scholarship examination. These programmes were carried out by an eminent panel of lecturers who carries a wealth of experience and expertise in the field of education.
