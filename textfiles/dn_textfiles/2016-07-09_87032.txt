Gunadasa Amarasekara files FR

Patriotic National Movement president Dr. Gunadasa Amarasekara yesterday filed a Fundamental Rights petition in the Supreme Court invoking Court jurisdiction in order to gain access to information concerning certain negotiations which purportedly took place between the Government of Sri Lanka, the United States and the Tamil National Alliance (TNA) with respect to the contents of a resolution that was tabled at the United Nations Human Rights Council in September 2015.
In his petition, Dr. Amarasekara cited the Secretary to the President P.B.Abeykoon and Attorney General as respondents.
The petitioner stated that on June 28, 2016 he read a national newspaper that Member of Parliament M.A. Sumanthiran had made a statement in the United States Congress that prior to the Government Of Sri Lanka (GOSL) co-sponsoring resolution at the UNHHRC in September 2015, the GOSL, the US and TNA had reached agreement with respect to the contents of that resolution, in particular with respect to special prosecution and judicial mechanism to be set up pursuant to the terms of said resolution.
The petitioner stated that the above is the first time he had heard of such agreement being reached by the GOSL, the US and the TNA with respect to the content of the said resolution, prior to the said resolution being tabled at the UNHRC. The petitioner sought an order directing the Secretary to the President to provide truthful unambiguous and clear answer to the question; was there, prior to the tabling of resolution at the UNHRC on or about September 24, 2015, a process of negotiations between the GOSL, the US and the TNA and any other political party, about the contents of that resolution, particularly the issue of special prosecutorial and judicial mechanism to pursue inter alia war crimes allegations? This petition was filed through Counsel Nuwan Ballantudawe.
