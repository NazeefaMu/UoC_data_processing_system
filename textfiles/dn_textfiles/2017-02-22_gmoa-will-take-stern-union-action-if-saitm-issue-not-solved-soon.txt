GMOA will take stern union action if SAITM issue not solved soon

All Government Medical Officers' Association (GMOA) members will not hesitate to take stern trade union action and use the organisations' full power by launching a island-wide strike to solve the SAITM issue if the Government does not solve it soon, GMOA Media Spokesman Dr. Samantha Ananda said.
Addressing a press conference at the GMOA Head Quarters in Colombo 7 yesterday, Dr. Ananda said the Uva Province GMOA took trade union actions yesterday and did not carry out ordinary services from 8.00 am to 12.00 noon, and they decided to continue it till 8.00 am today. This is the province where halting medical service can cause minimum damage. Country has eight more provinces. This is not an island-wide strike. The GMOA compelled to take this minor union action because of the silence of the Government in solving the SAITM issue.
According to Dr. Ananda, the GMOA is doing this to safeguard patients' lives and not for doctors' benefit. Therefore, the GMOA confirms that all emergency, maternity, pediatric care services, kidney treatment, cancer and so on will not be affected by any union actions. People have already understood the risk they are going to face due to the SAITM issue. Nobody can let a minister or anyone else to put the patient's lives at risk.
GMOA Assistant Secretary Dr. Haritha Aluthge said it is the time the health Minister to prove his neutral position and show that he is not biased towards the SAITM. He can simply do this by signing the Gazette Notification on minimum standards of medical education. Students intake for the SAITM take place once in every six month and it is hilarious to stop it for six months.
