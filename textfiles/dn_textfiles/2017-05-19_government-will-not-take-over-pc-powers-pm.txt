Government will not take over PC powers: PM

The government will neither take over the powers vested in Provincial Councils by the Constitution nor hand over any of its powers to the Provincial Councils, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said.
Wickremesinghe was addressing the gathering after opening an educational exhibition held at the Bandarawela S. Thomas’ College to mark the school’s 75th anniversary celebrations on May 18.
He said the government will formulate a national policy to develop education and allocate adequate funds to recruit new teachers. The practice of recruiting teachers and providing them with training would be done away with and a system to recruit teachers after proper training would be implemented in its place, he said.
Wickremesinghe said teachers would be recruited on a school basis in future rather than for provincial or government service. This system would help boost education. A progress review methodology would be introduced in respect of teachers and schools. Steps would also be taken to update the knowledge of teachers regularly.
Emphasising that success of education depended on quality teachers, the Prime Minister said the educational re-organisation would be carried out within the next five years.
