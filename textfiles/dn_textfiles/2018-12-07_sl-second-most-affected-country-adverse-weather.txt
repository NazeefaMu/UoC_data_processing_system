SL second most affected country with adverse weather

Sri Lanka was the second most affected country from extreme weather events in 2017 according to the ‘Global Climate Risk index 2019’ report published on Tuesday in ‘COP 24’.
Centre for Environmental Justice Founder Hemantha Withanage, who was participating in the 24th Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (COP 24) in Katowice, Poland, said the latest report released at the forum by ‘Germanwatch’ (a think tank and research group) ranked Sri Lanka as the second in the list of countries to be affected by extreme weather events in 2017.
According to the report available online, Puerto Rico, Sri Lanka and Dominica were at the top of the list of the most affected countries in 2017.
The report points out that over 200 people died and 600,000 people were displaced in May 2017 in southwestern regions of Sri Lanka due to landslides and floods that occurred after the worst rains on the Indian Ocean since 2003.
According to the report, the Climate Risk Index indicates a level of exposure and vulnerability to extreme events, which countries should understand as warnings in order to be prepared for more frequent and/or more severe events in the future.
“Altogether, more than 526,000 people died as a direct result of more than 11,500 extreme weather events; and losses between 1998 and 2017 amounted to around USD 3.47 trillion (in Purchasing Power Parities),” the report said. Between 1998 and 2017, Puerto Rico, Honduras and Myanmar were the most affected countries by extreme weather events.
It says Sri Lanka’s loss in the last year due to extreme weather events amounted to around USD 3,129.351 million (in Purchasing Power Parities). PPPs measure the total amount of goods and services that a single unit of a country’s currency can buy in another country.
The Climate Risk Index aims to contextualize ongoing climate policy debates – especially the international climate negotiations– with real-world impacts during the last year and the last 20 years, the report explained.
