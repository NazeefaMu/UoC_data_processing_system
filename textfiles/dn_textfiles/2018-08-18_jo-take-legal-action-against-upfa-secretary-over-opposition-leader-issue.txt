JO to take legal action against UPFA Secretary over Opposition Leader issue

The Joint Opposition (JO) has decided to take legal action against UPFA Secretary and Minister Mahinda Amaraweera for providing his opinion in a letter to Speaker Karu Jayasuriya on the matter of the Opposition Leader’s post in Parliament, said Parliamentarian C. B. Ratnayaka.
He was addressing a media briefing in Colombo, recently.
He said the UPFA Executive Committee had not been convened for over a year. He asked as to how the UPFA General Secretary arrived at a decision over the position of the Opposition Leader in Parliament.
He said JO Leader Dinesh Gunawardena and UPFA MPs Susil Premajayantha also represent the Executive Committee but they had not been consulted over the decision taken with regard to the Opposition Leader’s post.
He said: “this is the personal opinion of the UPFA Secretary as other Executive Committee members have not been consulted. Therefore, the JO will take legal action against him.”
