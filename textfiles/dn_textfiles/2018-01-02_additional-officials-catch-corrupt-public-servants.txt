Additional officials to catch corrupt public servants

The Bribery Commission, as per President Maithripala Sirisena’s instructions, would deploy about 200 additional officials countrywide to nab public servants who accept bribes from the general public, Kurunegala District Senior Divisional Secretary W.E. Jayathilake said.
He was speaking at a meeting of pensioners in the Kurunegala district at Bingiriya on December 31, 2017.
Three police officers attached to the traffic division of the Polgahawela Police Station were arrested for accepting a Rs.5,000 bribe from a man to release his driving licence and they were produced before Kurunegala Magistrate Sampath Hewawasam recently, he said.
About 234 government officials who have allegedly solicited bribes were arrested in 2017, he said.
