Horses’ tale

Of all the stories in Susanna Forrest’s book The Age of the Horse: An equine journey through human history, the vignette that, perhaps, lingers most in the memory takes only a page or two to tell. Yet in many ways it defines the infinitely complex relationship that exists between man and the genus Equus. It involves mankind’s continuing attempts to domesticate one of the breeds of pure wild horse, the Tarpan, once common in the Ukraine. By the 1870s, Tarpan numbers had dwindled almost to the point of no return when a lone mare was spotted by the herdsmen on the Rachmanov Steppe, coming closer and closer to their herd of domestic horses, presumably for company. The mare mated with the herd’s stallion and went on to bear two foals. One day she followed them into a landowner’s stable. His men, realizing her value, rushed in to separate her from the other horses, and the ensuing fight was so brutal that she lost an eye.
Elusive apparition
She raged, according to Forrest, trying to climb out of the box they shut her in, striking at them whenever they came near. Locked into the stable, she settled enough to give birth to a third foal, but when the spring came and the horses were let loose to graze, she fled, leaving her foal behind. In the autumn she was seen again by the local horsemen – an elusive apparition, appearing and disappearing in the surrounding landscape. Deciding to test their horses against her they set out to capture her, driving her from one horseman and mount to the next – but she outran them all, until, leaping a snowbank she stumbled in a hidden runnel, and broke a leg. They hauled her on a sleigh to the local village, where they planned to make a false leg for her, but she died some days later – the last of the known pure Tarpans. In that story lies the kind of emotive kernel that has drawn millions of readers – and not only horse-loving ones – to books such as Black Beauty, My Friend Flicka and The Silver Brumby, albeit without the happy ending that fiction writers can bestow on their equine characters.
Forrest has carved out an unusual place for herself as a chronicler of all things equine. Last year, she won the Sophie Coe Prize for food writing for her essay “‘Horsemeat is Certainly Delicious’: Anxiety, xenophobia and rationalism at a nineteenth-century American hippophagic banquet”, which traces evolving attitudes to eating horse from neolithic Europe and Asia to twentieth-century New York; she is also the author of If Wishes Were Horses: A memoir of equine obsession (2012). In the latest book she brings her eye for detail and story-telling abilities to an extensively researched, fascinating history, covering subjects as diverse as the increasing popularity of equine therapy programmes, the return to horse-powered farming in some American communities, the Tahki of Mongolia and their highly prized speedy ponies, and the particularities of breeding Shire horses. Perhaps because of the ground the book attempts to cover, things get off to a slightly shaky start. There is a staccato quality to the sentences and a somewhat stilted edge to the prose in the first few chapters, as though the author were struggling to find her stride. But as the book progresses, Forrest’s passionate interest in her subject engages and we readily follow her as she travels to America, and through much of mainland Europe, Britain and China.
Forrest has spent time with many people who have sought to understand how a horse thinks, including Lucy Rees, the author of the classic The Horse’s Mind (1984). Rees left her job as a neurophysiologist because she was disturbed by the medical stance on animal experimentation.
She moved from London to live in the mountains of North Wales and, after her own experiences with horses, which included rehabilitating a neurotic Lipizzaner stallion into a calm trail-riding horse, Rees became fascinated with wild horses. She was surprised to discover that, rather than the hierarchical structure generally understood to be operating in any herd, horse groups in fact work under three rules: cohesion, space and synchrony. The interview with Rees is one of the highlights of the book – it illustrated what I have observed myself over decades of riding, rescuing, breeding and “starting” horses – that horses, if allowed, travel and graze in a constant ebb and flow; there is a hardly perceptible collective orchestration to their movements that we don’t notice until we look closely.
A no doubt connected fact, according to Rees, is that, to a horse, company is essential. A lonely horse, concludes Forrest, and all sentient horse owners will concur, is an unhappy horse; and as the story of the last known Tarpan shows, a solitary horse will seek its place among others of its kind. Forrest traverses the written history of the horse, dove-tailing it neatly with her physical travels in the modern-day horse world.
In America, she was surprised to find that, in part thanks to the Amish and their insistence on traditional farming methods, British heavy horses such as the Suffolk Punch are as much in demand there as they are in decline in the UK. At a Horse Progress Day in Holmes County, Ohio, she meets a farmer, Jason Rutledge, who exclusively uses heavy horses for his farming needs.
Fossil fuel
“It’s disrespectful to throw away thousands of years of expertise for seventy-five years of fossil fuel”, Rutledge says. “I don’t work with horses because I want to go back to the past, I’m doing it because we must preserve this as a valid tool in the toolbox of humanity for the future.” Rutledge, Forrest discovers, is far from alone.
There are small communities throughout the US committed to a sustainable, organic and solar-powered future in which the horse has a permanent and vital role.
Also in the US she spends time with battle-scarred veterans at a centre where horses are used to help returned soldiers to overcome PTSD – and, at the other end of the spectrum, she visits China to witness the growth of the luxury horse market for the very wealthy, where horses live in air-conditioned stables with piped music.
Endless possibilities
We learn, too, of circus trick riders and the eighteenth-century theatrical spectaculars known as “carrousels”, as Forrest takes us through the seemingly endless possibilities of horse–human relationships. She does not, however, shy away from the darker aspects of the horse industry, confronting the vexed question of horse abattoirs in the US (the enforced closure of all but a few has simply meant that thousands of horses a day are trucked across the border to Canada), and the European horsemeat scandal of 2013. The question left hanging is, in a sense, unanswerable – what is a horse’s life worth?
Perhaps I am showing an Antipodean sensibility, but the book’s title seems somewhat misleading: it suggests an all-encompassing account that the volume surely cannot pretend to deliver a journey through human history when horse-proud countries such as Australia and New Zealand, Iceland, Dubai, Finland and Ireland, to name but a few, are missing from the story.
The contributions of Australia and New Zealand to the First World War in horseflesh alone is staggering. 136,000 “Walers” – so-called because, although the horses came from all parts of Australia, they were originally sold through New South Wales – were sent to join the war effort; they were sturdy, hardy horses, able to travel long distances in hot weather with little water. One horse made it back to Australia – Sandy, the personal mount of Major General Sir William Bridges, who died at Gallipoli. At the end of the war, 13,000 horses were “surplus to needs”; of those, 11,000 were sent as remounts – mainly to the British army in India – and the others were destroyed.
The ANZAC mounted division formed in Egypt in 1916, and of the 18,000 horses New Zealand contributed, four returned home. In the end, of course, an author has to make choices about what to include, and what to leave out, and Susanna Forrest rightly talks about the work as an “unmapped territory of branching carriles that intersected in impossible complexity”. She would, she decided, trace her own paths among them, and her passion for the horse leaps from the pages of a book that is a rich fount of knowledge for anyone interested in the innumerable and endlessly fascinating points where horse and human meet.
