Four Indian fishermen injured in brawl with Sri Lankan fishermen

Four Tamil Nadu fishermen suffered serious injuries after they were attacked allegedly by Sri Lankan fishermen near Kodiyakarai off the island nation.
The Sri Lankan fishermen first threatened them with hand guns and attacked them with sharp weapons, Pamban Country Boat Association leader S Arul said.
“Their fishing nets and equipment, cell phones and walkie talkies were also taken away,” he was quoted as saying by PTI.
The fishermen were part of a group of seven who had put out to sea early on Friday morning from Pamban, Arul said, adding the others managed to return to shore.
The four fishermen have been hospitalised.
