Mercury Institute celebrates 15 years in education

Mercury Institute of Management, ACCA’s premier and only Platinum Status Tuition Provider in Sri Lanka completes 15 years of excellence in academic and professional education. Mercury Managing Director Jeevith Shakespeare the driving force behind the Institute said the growth of Mercury into a Specialist Institute for Accounting, Finance and Management is the result of the holistic approach they take to bettering the total Commerce stream education scenario in Sri Lanka.
“As a truly dedicated and committed education entity and based on our will to adhere to truly global standards, we are the only accredited Sri Lankan Institute to offer the ACCA Professional Qualification, MSc. and BSc. Degrees from the University of London, BSc. (Hons) Degrees from Oxford Brookes University, UK and the CFA program to students in Sri Lanka and the region.
We have expanded our presence with fully-fledged campuses in Colpetty, Dehiwela, Wattala and Galle and have partnerships in Maldives, India and Qatar.
The response from parents and students in Sri Lanka has inspired us to invest in key locations making professional education more convenient and accessible to those committed to making top careers for themselves.
“We have also worked out measures to help parents spend less on registration, subscription and overall fees, which in turn has reflected in very encouraging student enrolment and continuity in studies until they receive their credentials”.
Through Mercury’s Business Academy, tuition is provided for students studying towards their Cambridge and Edexcel O/L and A/L examinations for subjects like Accounting, Business Studies, Economic and Statistics, and have produced a host of World and Sri Lankan rankings for all these subjects.
Upon completion of their secondary education, students have a very rich choice of higher education options. If they wish to read for an academic qualification, they have the choice of enrolling for the BSc. (Hons) in Applied Accounting from Oxford Brookes University, UK or the BSc. (Hons) in Accountancy and Finance, BSc. (Hons) in Economics and Management or the BSc. (Hons) in Business and Management from the University of London, all of which are UGC recognized programmes.
If they wish to follow a professional qualification right after their O/Ls or A/Ls, then ACCA at Mercury is the best choice. Students can also enrol for ACCA with exemptions upon completion of their degree. Moreover, Mercury also offers a range of high-quality postgraduate programmes as well.
The CFA qualification is one of USA’s finest professional qualifications for those seeking to pursue a career in investment banking, and another option available to students is the MSc. in Professional Accountancy from the University of London.
Mercury also provides training on computerized accounting software to ensure that its students have the necessary competitive advantage to thrive and flourish in today’s competitive corporate arena.
And it does not end there. Mercury’s in-house Job Bank guarantees placements at some of Sri Lanka’s top conglomerates, and has tied with up a number of companies from diverse industries such as apparel, banking, financial services, airlines, telecommunication, manufacturing and pharmaceuticals, just to name a few.
Mercury stands out as a beacon for students aiming to become professionals and leaders at the highest level anywhere in the world, Shakespeare said.
