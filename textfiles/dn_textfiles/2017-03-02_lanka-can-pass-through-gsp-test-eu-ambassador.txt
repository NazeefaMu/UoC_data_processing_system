Lanka can pass through GSP + test in EU - Ambassador

 Sri Lanka can pass through to get the General System of Preferences Plus (GSP) concession once again, EU Ambassador to Sri Lanka Tung Lai-Margue said.
Speaking at the seminar titled ‘EU Trade Policy – Opportunities for Sri Lanka’ organised by the European Chamber of Commerce of Sri Lanka (ECCSL) in partnership with the Delegation of the European Union (EU), and the Shippers Academy he said that he is confident that Sri Lanka would regain the GSP Plus again.
Lanka’s export sector benefitted as a result, until the concession was withdrawn in August 2010, amid allegations of rights abuses during the end of the LTTE war.
The Unity Government in June 2016 formally applied for GSP+ after months of discussions and action on the ground. In 2000, Sri Lanka exported 34% of its GDP, but by 2014 end, exports had fallen to 14%.
He said since the application was made, tangible results are being seen.
“The proposal form forwarded to the European Commission has now reached a critical and final stage. It’s now up to the European Parliament to uphold this request,” he said.
Deputy Foreign Affairs Minister Dr. Harsha De Silva said Sri Lanka is on course to receive this concession as the Unity government has won the confidence of the EU once again. “Things are
positive and moving forward.”
“We hope that European Council and parliament will not object to the recommendations made by European Commission in order to reinstate this facility.”
He said there had never been any unreasonable conditions whatsoever. He also said that whatever the opposition said that they have delivered and kept their promises made to Parliament.
“We are paying back heavy debt incurred by the previous government and we are paying for their sins.”
The Minister said they have to rebalance the incentive structure to boost the tradable sector.
“This will see people who have capital putting the money where it brings return on their investment.“We have completely ignored the tradable sector in this country. We have to incentivise the capital flowing into the tradable sector.”
The seminar also focused on the EU’s ongoing and planned FTAs with other countries in the region.
The seminar coincided with a visit by over 50 EU officials from Brussels and the Asian region that will be in Sri Lanka to attend an internal trade coordination meeting.
