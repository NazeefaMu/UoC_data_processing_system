More buses to minimise public inconvenience

Transport and Civil Aviation Ministry sources yesterday said that a number of measures have been taken to minimise the inconvenience faced by the railway commuters due to sudden wild cat strike action launched by the Sri Lanka Railway Department trade unions. All leave of Sri Lanka Transport Board employees has been cancelled and a fleet of over 500 buses which were deployed for the transport of schoolchildren would be in operation.
According to Transport and Civil Aviation Ministry Secretary G.S. Vithanage, buses will be allowed to operate on any route to alleviate the inconvenience faced by the public and the Police have already been informed about the Ministry decision.
The Ministry Secretary added that Sri Lanka Army buses will also be deployed to transport passengers with the assistance of Army personnel. He requested the public to use alternative modes of transport until the present situation is brought under control.
Vithanage said the government has granted permission for railway commuters to travel in SLCTB buses with their railway season tickets.
SLCTB Chairman Ramal Siriwardena said a fleet of 100 buses are in operation in addition to routine service. “The passengers facing any issues can contact the SLCTB on 0-11 7555555,” he said.
