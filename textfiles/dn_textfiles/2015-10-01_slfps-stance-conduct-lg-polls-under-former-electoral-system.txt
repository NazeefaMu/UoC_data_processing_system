SLFP's stance to conduct LG polls under former electoral system

The SLFP's stance is to conduct the Local Government elections under the former electoral system, Transport Minister Nimal Siripala de Silva.
Addressing the media at the SLFP headquarters yesterday, the minister said the UNP has less faith in the former electoral system as they think it will be disadvantageous to their party. "Therefore amendments to the system has to be made to solve similar issues. It was Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe's pledge to implement the new electoral reforms within a year. We hope that the new electoral reforms will be enacted as promised," he said.
