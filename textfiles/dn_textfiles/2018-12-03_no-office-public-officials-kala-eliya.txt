No office for public officials in Kala Eliya

Kala Eliya in Ja-Ela lacks a sub unit for the health and Samurdhi officers and the Grama Niladhari.
Ja-Ela Urban Council has constructed a building for the purpose, but it is now abandoned. Doors and windows of the building were now taken away by vandals..
Marist Brothers Congregation has donated the land for the building for free.
Expectant mothers and mothers with infants have to be under trees for their monthly clinics now, residents say.
