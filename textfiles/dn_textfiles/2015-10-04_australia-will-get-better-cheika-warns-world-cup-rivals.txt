Australia will get better, Cheika warns World Cup rivals

Australia will get better as the World Cup goes on, coach Michael Cheika said as the Wallabies celebrated knocking old rivals England out of the tournament.
But Cheika acknowledged the tournament will not get any easier as Australia next play Wales. He described Wales boss Warren Gatland as a "master coach."
Australia outclassed England in virtually every area on Saturday night to guarantee their place in the quarter finals.
The 33-13 score was their biggest winning margin over England at Twickenham. Fly-half Bernard Foley's 28-point haul was the highest by an Australian against England.
Cheika insisted there is room for improvement before the Wallabies return to Twickenham next Saturday to face Wales to see who tops Pool A, the so-called "Pool of Death". Australia have beaten Wales 10 times in a row but their coach said a new victory was not assured.
"It is just about ourselves at the moment and trying to improve on that," said Cheika.
"We are coming up against the master coach (Gatland) next week. I'm not going to change what I do because we won a game."
Cheika, the only coach to have guided sides to victory in the northern hemisphere's European Cup and the southern hemisphere's Super Rugby, said: "There are a lot of areas we can improve on."
"The commitment was very good and we will improve on that going forward. "We really wanted it, to win and to play well. We knew there would be a lot of pain in England's backyard. "It was outrageously loud (at Twickenham) and we wanted to get stuck in from the start."
Scrum success
Australia were overpowered at the scrum in losing their last two Tests at Twickenham. But they forced a number of scrum penalties on Saturday and Cheika praised the work of Argentine forwards coach Mario Ledesma.
