1st four-day under 19 cricket test
Centuries by Taide, Badoni gives  India commanding lead

India took a commanding lead over Sri Lanka in the first four-day under 19 cricket test with centuries by Atharwa Taide and Ayush Badoni carrying them to a second day total of 473 for five wickets by the close at the NCC grounds yesterday.
Taide struck 13 fours in compiling 113 off 169 balls and after Sri Lanka had captured three middle order wickets for 63 runs they were further frustrated by the sixth wicket pair of Nehal Wadhera and Ayush Badoni who have been associated in an unfinished stand of 183 that carried the total from 290-5 to 473-5 by stumps.
Wadhera had 9 fours and 3 sixes in his unbeaten 81 scored off 117 balls and Badoni 11 fours and 2 sixes in his 107 not out off 115 balls.
Opening batsman Anuj Rawat played a dependable knock as captain to compile a half century out of a first wicket stand of 92 with Taide. He scored 63 off 59 balls with 8 fours and 2 sixes.
Dunith Wellalage hurt his finger while fielding and went off the field. The match will continue on its third day today.
