Halterm Terminal to boost ultra-class box-ship handling capabilities

Canada’s Halterm International Container Terminal revealed plans to extend its container and reefer handling capabilities with AUD 10 million worth of new equipment over the next twelve months.
The move comes after the terminal saw increased container traffic through 2016 and the first half of 2017.
The developments are expected to support the terminal’s existing five ship-to-shore crane operation, providing carriers congestion-free operations over more than a kilometer of the quay, at three berths between 14-16 meters draft.
“Halterm provides global container carriers with access to eastern Canada and the Halifax supply-chain reaches far inland and to the US Midwest.
After significant ship-to-shore crane investments delivered into the operation in early 2014, it is the right time to bring on new rubber-tired gantry cranes (RTGs) which will be arriving in February (1) and October (2) of next year,” Kim Holtermand, CEO of Halterm International Container Terminal, said.
Halterm, which is capable of handling Ultra class container-ships of 10,000+ TEU size, is in the process of optimizing its existing container yard, which involves the removal of three redundant 1970’s era ship-to-shore crane assets and the addition of new reefer capacity – an increase of more than 25% to over 600 reefer plugs.
The three new ‘1 over 5’ RTGs from Konecranes are to be delivered in 2018. They will span six lanes and allow Halterm to stack containers five-high across import and export zones – an increase in yard capacity of 160,000 TEU, up 40% overall.
Halterm maintains a basic workforce of more than 100 longshoremen, handling services for Ocean Alliance partners (CMA CGM, Evergreen, Cosco and OOCL), Zim Integrated Shipping, Maersk Line, Tropical Shipping, Eimskip, Melfi, TMSI and weekly domestic service to Newfoundland with Oceanex.
