Learning from the experience

Angelo Mathews has branded the 0-3 whitewash his team suffered at the hands of South Africa as his worst defeat as captain. The Lankan captain is not far from the truth when he says that because Sri Lanka were not given a chance to make a comeback in any of the three Tests by a rampant South African side led ably by Faf du Plessis who has nicely filled in the shoes of injured skipper AB de Villiers whose long standing elbow injury (he has not played any cricket since July) had forced him to give up the captaincy.
“I have been part of many defeats but as captain this is certainly the worst. We kind of expected to do better than what we did. But there was no improvement,” said Mathews after his team had suffered a humiliating innings defeat inside four days in the third and final Test at Johannesburg.
“The batters were extremely disappointing - all the batters, including myself. All of us had got starts but didn’t convert them into big ones. That is disappointing. To give the bowlers a chance we need to put the runs on the board.”
Certainly Sri Lanka gave themselves their best shot at competing well in South Africa in their preparations ahead of the tour.
“When it comes to preparation we did our best. We practiced on wickets with grass back in Sri Lanka too. We kind of expected we will get wickets with lot of grass. It’s not easy to prepare wickets like this in Sri Lanka, given the high humidity. Life goes on and we need to find a solution to compete well overseas,” said Mathews.
However much of time you spend on preparations there is no substitute for the real thing – that is playing in the middle against the opposition. The atmosphere at preparations and during a Test match are totally different and so is the pressure when you have close catch-in fielders around you and bowlers flaunt you with looks that are sometimes intimidating.
A good example is the pains Steve Smith’s Australian team took last August in preparing themselves for the spinning surfaces and hot and humid conditions they would encounter in Sri Lanka ahead of the three-Test series. Australia even hired the most prolific wicket-taker in Test history Sri Lankan off-spinner Muthiah Muralitharan as their spin bowling consultant to assist them counter the spin threat of Sri Lanka and to give the bowlers and batsmen first hand information of pitches and conditions. Despite all these preparations Australia suffered a rare 0-3 whitewash at the hands of Sri Lanka and when they left our shores the batsmen and bowlers had still not mastered the subcontinent conditions.
It is the same with subcontinent teams when they tour countries like England, Australia, South Africa and New Zealand where the opposite happens. Asian batsmen struggle against pace, bounce and swing in these countries as much as their counterparts do against spin when they travel the subcontinent.
Where Sri Lanka let themselves down was their lack of fight throughout the series. Losing is one thing but the manner in which you lose is what counts. Sri Lanka simply buckled under pressure and surrendered their wickets meekly which is what makes their performance disappointing and pathetic. On several occasions the batters made starts but failed to convert them into big innings.
This comes from a lack of concentration against high class bowling where the batsman rarely finds a loose ball coming his way to score runs. On occasions such as this it is important to keep rotating the strike so that the bowler is kept thinking all the time and there is less pressure on the batsman as he does not have to face the same bowler all the time.
Aravinda de Silva one of the greatest batsmen produced by Sri Lanka although brilliant was loose in his stroke play during the early part of his career. He had every shot in the book including the hook shot which you seldom see batsmen play these days. De Silva would bat as if he was good for a hundred and suddenly play a rash shot that would lead to his downfall. One season of English county cricket with Kent changed all that. It is said that a cricketers’ education is not complete without a tour of England. Why the pundits say that is because in England the conditions can change so quickly that you have to be at your best to counter the moving ball. One moment it could be bright and sunny and the next overcast with heavy clouds and the ball would suddenly start playing tricks on you. The experience De Silva got from that one season playing in England disciplined his batting to such an extent that he was a totally different batsman altogether. He scored seven Test centuries in his first 48 matches prior to going to Kent and 13 in his remaining 45 Tests. In addition it was his extraordinary batting in the semi-finals and final that won Sri Lanka the Cricket World Cup in 1996.
It would not be a bad idea if players like Dinesh Chandimal, Kusal Mendis and Dhananjaya de Silva to name a few can be found contracts to play a full season of county cricket in England so that the experience they gain would tighten and bring about a certain amount of discipline to their batting which is what the present team batters lack when they play outside the subcontinent.
