UK Human Rights Report indicates improvement in Sri Lanka: Expresses concern over inter-communal tension

 
The United Kingdom (UK) Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) 2016 report on Human Rights and Democracy noted that while Sri Lanka saw progress it several areas, much remained to be done.
‘The human rights situation in Sri Lanka saw some improvement in 2016. The Government of Sri Lanka made progress against some of its commitments reflected in UN Human Rights Council (HRC) Resolution 30/1, but much remains to be done,’ the report said.
It highlighted in particular inter-communal tensions stoked by the hate speech of members of extremist nationalist groups as well as discrimination against LGB&T persons:
‘Inter-communal tensions remained an area of concern,’ it said, ‘ adding that discrimination against LGB&T persons ‘remained a problem,’.
It welcomed the passing of legislation establishing an Office of Missing Persons, saying it was ‘an important step towards reconciliation,’ and said that it hoped the constitutional reform process would ‘address issues of devolution and introduce a Bill of Rights’.
‘The Sri Lankan Government is committed to repealing the much criticized Prevention of Terrorism Act (PTA) and is drafting new counter-terrorism legislation which it intends will be compliant with international human rights standards,’ the report said. ‘These would be important steps in removing historic grievances and strengthening human rights and the rule of law in Sri Lanka.’
It reported that the government announced further land releases in 2016 and that while the military maintained a significant presence in the north, the lower profile it took was generally welcomed.
‘The UK has consistently called for the acceleration of land releases and the demilitarisation of the north. Some prisoners held under the existing PTA were released, though many remain in detention without charge, ‘ the report added.
‘Reports of surveillance, intimidation and harassment by the security forces (have) continued in the north and east, although at much lower levels than under the previous government,’ it further said.
‘Sri Lanka continued to engage with the UN and invited a number of UN experts to visit the country, including the UN Special Rapporteur on Torture, the report said, adding: ‘He reported full cooperation by the government, but raised concerns about the standard of detention centres and continued cases of torture.’
 'The UK continued to support Sri Lankan Government efforts to develop a more capable, professional and accountable police force, with the aim of reducing the risk of human rights violations, including torture, and improving public confidence in the rule of law, the report said. 
'The UK also provided support for the UN’s work on reconciliation and peace building, and demining in the north. The then FCO Minister for Human Rights and the Commonwealth, Baroness Anelay, visited Sri Lanka in November and underlined the UK’s commitment to support reconciliation and accountability.'
'The minister also highlighted UK work to help tackle sexual and gender-based violence in Sri Lanka and the importance of accountability and tackling the stigma suffered by victims. She welcomed the Sri Lankan Government’s endorsement of the Declaration of Commitment to End Sexual Violence in Conflict earlier in the year.'
In 2017, the UK will continue to support and encourage Sri Lanka to make further and faster progress on human rights. We will continue to work with the Sri Lankan Government, international partners and civil society to support delivery of the commitments that Sri Lanka has made to promote accountability, reconciliation and human rights and look forward to the report of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights on Sri Lanka’s progress before the HRC in March 2017, the report said.
