‘TNA’s decision on NCM should benefit Tamil community’

Northern Province Chief Minister C. V. Vigneswaran said yesterday that a decision taken by the Tamil National Alliance’s (TNA’s) with regard to the No-confidence Motion motion against Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe in parliament, should be one that benefits the Tamil people.
He added that the TNA should reach an understanding in writing with its party members, before voting takes place in parliament. The chief minister said that United National Party parliaemntarians who stood against the Prime Minister, had not come to an understanding with him yet and hence, there was doubt over their decision.
