Croatia beat France, into Davis Cup final

Zadar, Sunday: Croatia sealed their ticket to the Davis Cup final after Marin Cilic's three sets victory over Richard Gasquet gave them an unassailable 3-1 lead over nine-time champions France in Zadar.
Croatia, titleholders only once in 2005, will face the winner of the other semi-final between holders Great Britain and Argentina in the November final.
World number 11 Cilic bagged the all important point in the first of Sunday's reverse singles, seeing off Gasquet 6-3, 6-2, 7-5.
Gasquet, 17th in the world, was drafted in after Jo-Wilfried Tsonga and Gael Monfils pulled out with knee injuries.
Croatia had taken command of the tie in Saturday's doubles when Cilic and Ivan Dodig downed top-ranked French pair Pierre-Hugues Herbert and Nicolas Mahut 7-6 (8/6), 5-7, 7-6 (8/6), 6-3 after the two sides split the opening singles on Friday. AFP
