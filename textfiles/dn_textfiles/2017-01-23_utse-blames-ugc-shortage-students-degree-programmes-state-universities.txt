UTSE blames UGC for shortage of students to degree programmes at state universities

The University Teachers for Social Equity (UTSE) say a significant shortage can be witnessed in admission to some of the degree programmes of the government universities when compared to the allocated number of students by the University Grants Commission (UGC).
They said a large number of vacancies in the science faculties and agriculture faculties of the UGC funded universities during the past years and the relevant authorities had not been able to take reliable actions to resolve this issue.
The UGC has not yet provided final lists of the selected students who passed GCE (A/L) examinations in 2015 to the many of the science and agriculture faculties within the government university system where the students have the opportunities to follow physical science, biological science, computer science, fisheries and agriculture degree programmes, the UTSE said."When we analyse the statistics published by the UGC itself, it is possible to identify the gravity of this issue.
Present and previous ministers responsible for Higher Education have been quoting numbers of university admissions from their publications and have been promising that they have been increasing the number of student admissions to universities.
It is evident that those statements are not really truthful and that there is a decrease in admissions of students to many of the degree programmes.
Some parties, who are justifying and promoting private universities, supports the argument that the government universities has no sufficient facilities and opportunities to expand the government funded universities to increase the number of students. However, the documents published by the UGC reveal that the required number of admissions to government funded universities had not been done by the UGC for many years to use the facilities and opportunities available within those universities.|
As a result of this situation, a significant number of students who are unable to afford the cost of private universities had lost their opportunities for higher education and therefore it had prevented the right and the opportunity of the public for using revenue of tax in an optimal manner.
This is a highly critical issue for the innocent children who have no any other way of protecting their future other than going through higher education, the UTSE noted in its press release.
