Deaf School Past Pupils’ Association AGM

The Ratmalana Deaf School Past Pupils’ Association will have its 68th annual general meeting and the election of the office bearers for the year 2017/2018 on July 30 at the Stanley Hall of the School for the Deaf at 9.00 am. It will be followed by lunch.
The current President and Life Member Shivantha Vivekanandan, who was elected as its president for 15 successive years, said that his alma mater produced many distinguished past pupils. The Deaf School Past Pupils’ Association, Ratmalana, was founded in 1949 by late Stanley Perera, late Dennis Fonseka and Ryle de Mel, as a result of their sense of purpose and hard work. It is the only deaf association which has been in existence for over 65 years that keeps the public of Sri Lanka informed about it’s activities.
Vivekanandan was grateful to Principal of the school and Patron of the Deaf School Past Pupils’ Association Samanthika Jayasuriya, for her valuable assistance given to the association.
