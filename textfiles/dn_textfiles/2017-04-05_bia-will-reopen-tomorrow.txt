BIA will reopen tomorrow

 
The rehabilitated and modernized runway of the Katunayake, Bandaranaike International Airport will re-open tomorrow at 12.30 noon.
Transport and Civil Aviation Minister Nimal Siripala de Silva said the newly bought SriLankan flight UL-1162 is scheduled to land at 12.30pm tomorrow from Trivandrum, the first arrival after the reopening of the airport.
He said a sum of US$ 50 million has been spent for the project.
The rehabilitated runway will be able to accommodate A380s as the width of the runway has been increased to 75 metres from an earlier 60 metres.
Renovations have been done according to the technology of Netherlands and the energy efficient LED Light system has been installed for ground lighting on the runaway for pilot’s convenience sake.
This will ensure 80 percent energy save,” the Minister said.
