SERTORA to begin September 21

The Scout Emergency Response Training of Rajans (SERTORA), a special training workshop on disaster management, would be held from September 21 to 23, at the Lakeview Park International Scout Centre, Dharmaraja College, Kandy.
The workshop would be organised by the first Kandy Dharmaraja College Scout Group and the Old Rajans Scout Association, under the guidance of Disaster Management Ministry, as well as the National Disaster Management Centre, to mark the 105th anniversary of the first Kandy Dharmaraja Scout Group.
“Disaster management is the organisation and management of resources in order to deal with emergencies. The workshop aims to teach scouts how to address such situations,” National Disaster Management Centre Director Brigadier Athula Ariyaratne said.
“It would highlight measures to prevent or reduce the damage caused by disasters as well,” Brigadier Ariyaratne added.
Scouts between the the ages of 18 and 24, who had received the District Commissioner’s Award, would be qualified to participate in the event.
