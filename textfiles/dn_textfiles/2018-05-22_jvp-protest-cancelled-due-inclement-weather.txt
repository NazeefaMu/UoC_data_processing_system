JVP protest cancelled due to inclement weather

The Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna protest which was to be held in Colombo today has been cancelled.
The media unit of the JVP said the protest and walk which was planned to be held at 3 pm today has been cancelled due to the existing weather condition.
The JVP media unit said the protest was to be held to compel the government to lift the excessive tax burden and to reduce the prices of commodities.
Meanwhile, JVP Uva Provincial Councillor Samantha Vidyaratne said the JVP was ready to extend its fullest support to take short-term, medium-term and long-term measures to protect the lives of the people in the Badulla district who face the threat of landslides due to the existing heavy rains.
Samantha Vidyaratne further said by now, over 100 families have been evacuated from their residencies due to the threat of landslides owing to the heavy rains which existed for 15 days. He added that cracks in some buildings and on the ground are visible in the Badulla district.
Referring to a research report issued by the National Building Research Organization in 2015, he said 66.9 percent of the lands in the Badulla district are threatened by landslides. He added that one of the main causes of landslides is human activities. He said the Uma Oya project had caused this threat to the Badulla district.
