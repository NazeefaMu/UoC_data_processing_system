Five gangsters  arrested  in Jaffna

 
Five persons, including several teenagers suspected to be members of an organised crime gang in Jaffna, had been arrested by the police.
A police team from the Kopay police station had arrested the suspects at Urumpirai. A motorcycle, mobile phones, two swords and masks in the suspects' possession had been taken into police custody. The police are investigating whether the gang had links with the Aava group, which was responsible for a spate of robberies and attacks in the Jaffna area recently.
They were to be produced before the Jaffna Magistrate’s Court.
