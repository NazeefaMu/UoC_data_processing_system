Muthurajawela plant commission delay incurred loss to govt: Weerakkody

Former Minister Chandima Weerakkody charged that the Petroleum Resources Development Ministry has delayed the commissioning of the newly constructed lubricant blending plant in Muthurajawela for four months resulting in losses to the Government.
Taking subject Minister Arjuna Ranatunga to task, the former Minister said the prices of lubricant oil could have been reduced by 30 percent had this plant been commissioned last December. The former minister made this observation in reply to allegations against him over the construction of the lubricant plant without adhering to the proper procedure.
He was speaking at the SLFP press conference held at its headquarters yesterday, in the absence of Minister Mahinda Samarasinghe, who was scheduled to address the press conference. “It was constructed by a Malaysian Company under a Build, Operate and Transfer (BOT) agreement at a cost of USD 18 million. It has a state-of-the-art technology but had been idling for the last four months.
“Who is delaying its operations? The current minister was responsible for a fuel crisis lately and soon he will also create a lubricant oil scarcity. He is catering to the motives of businessmen. The Ministry Secretary is simply a puppet,” he accused.
He also charged that the Government opted for spot tenders to buy oil during the last few months instead of long-term tenders. He said had the Government purchased oil on long-term tenders, had the price formula been introduced much earlier and had the lubricant facility been opened without delay, the Government would not have had to increase oil prices. He stated that the 16 SLFP members, who supported the No-Confidence Motion against the Prime Minister, will sit in the Opposition benches during the next Parliamentary sitting.
“There is no change to this decision despite various media speculations in this regard.
“All 16 of us will stay together and we remain in the SLFP under the leadership of President Maithripala Sirisena. We will sit in the opposition as an independent group,” he said.
