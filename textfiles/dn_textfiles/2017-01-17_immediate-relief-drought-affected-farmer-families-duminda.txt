Immediate relief for drought affected farmer families: Duminda

Agriculture development programmes scheduled for the Maha season in the Anuradhapura District had been cancelled due to the prevailing drought.
President Mithripala Sirisena has instructed to relevant authorities to give maximum relief for the affected families and to launch a programme to excavate the tanks in the Anuradhapura district deeper by removing sediments and to take steps to provide farmers with drinking water, Agriculture Minister Duminda Dissanayake said at the Anuradhapura district coordinating committee meeting in the Anuradhapura Provincial Council Auditorium.
The meeting was convened to make plans to provide relief for the drought affected people in the district.
The drought has severely affected around 1,50,000 farmer families. Although 1,30,000 hectares of paddy lands were to be cultivated, the prevailing drought conditions had hindered the initial plans. About 40,000 hectares of cultivated lands now face inevitable destruction due to the drought. The meeting focused specifically on providing relief to the affected farmer families.
About 20,000 wells on cultivated lands are now abandoned. The decision was made at the meeting to take immediate steps to rehabilitate these wells. The minister said the President had instructed wildlife and forest conservation authorities to release lands to the landless farmers. Since a large number of deep drinking wells were not used, they shall be renovated so as to provide suitable drinking water for farmer families.
North Central Water Supply and Drainage Board Assistant General Manager said three major reservoirs of Nuwarawewa, Tissawewa and Thuruwila tanks hold only a water capacity of 10,000, 1,405 and 5,750 acre.fts respectively. The water available at present is sufficient for only two months ahead.
He requested the political authority and the district coordinating committee to make the Mahaweli Authority and the Mahaweli Water Management Committee to issue in this month 3,000 acre ft of Mahaweli water to Nuwarawewa, 2,000 acre ft to Thuruwila and 1,000 acre ft to Thissawewa to avoid a water restriction.
The Anuradhapura district has 4,500 hand operating tube wells, he said. Of them, 1,500 wells are not functioning and they need immediate repairs. He said 500 million rupees should be released to revive at least 500 such tube wells.
