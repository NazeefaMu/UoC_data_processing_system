Group of SLFPers delaying LG elections: Dilum Amunugama

 
“It is not the United National Party but a group of SLFPers in the government who want to put off the local government election”, UPFA parliamentarian Dilum Amunugama said.
He said that UNP wanted to hold the election as soon as possible but the SLFP group in the government was showing reluctance for fear of imminent defeat.
“The Joint Opposition will increase their struggle to force the government to hold the local government election this year, irrespective of which party or faction will secure victory”, he said.
He said the government had deprived the people of their democratic rights by postponing the local government election and people at the grass root level faced immense problems due to the postponement of the election.
“Many local government institutions in the country have been brought under the supervision of special commissioners and secretaries. We will hold rallies and meetings to make the people aware of this situation”, he said.
