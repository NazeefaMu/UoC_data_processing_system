Wurth Pickup Shop relocated in Negombo

Wurth Lanka recently relocated its 3rd pickup shop to a better and convenient location in Negombo in order to serve customers more efficiently.
The showroom was opened by Rohan Amirthiah Managing Director Wurth Lanka, employees, Wurth Lanka agents, customers and well wishers. The new showroom is conveniently located to cater to Wurth’s walk-in customers in and around the Negombo area.  
“We are planning to open a few more pickup shops in Kandy and Kurunegala in the near future, and trust that the relocation of the Negombo pickup shop will enhance the customer experience” said Prasanna Mayadunna-Regional Manager, Wurth Lanka at the opening of the pickup shop.
The “pickup shop” concept was introduced to Sri Lanka by Wurth in 2013 with the first pickup shop in Nugegoda, which was an instant hit with customers. Wurth manages close to 2500 pickup shops worldwide which are patronized by craftsmen, vehicle enthusiasts, and contractors on a regular basis for their daily needs.
Wurth Lanka is a fully owned subsidiary of Wurth International, AG and belongs to Adolf Wurth GmbH, Germany-the parent company of the Wurth Group. Wurth is a Euro 12 Billion Company and one of the largest international trading companies with more than 400 subsidiaries in 83 countries.
