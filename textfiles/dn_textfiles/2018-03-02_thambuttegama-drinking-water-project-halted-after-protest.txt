Thambuttegama drinking water project halted after protest

Anuradhapura District Secretary R. M. Wanninayake said yesterday that a decision has been taken to temporarily suspend the drinking water supplying project in Thambuttegama, following the protest held by farmers in the area on Wednesday.
He was addressing a meeting held between protestors and Irrigation Department and National Water Supply and Drainage Board (NWSDB) officers on Wednesday. Wanninayake said this project aimed at providing clean water to the people in the area started on a Cabinet decision in 2011, with financial assistance from the Chinese government. The government of China has extended financial assistance to the tune of Rs. 17 million for the project.
"We will not take any decision to resume this project without consulting farmer representatives and agriculture and irrigation department officials. No one is selling water to any organisation or company," Government Agent Wanninayake said.
National Water Supply and Drainage Board officials said this project was implemented with bona fide intentions of providing clean, potable water to the people in the area where high prevalence of chronic kidney diseases were reported, the government agent added.
Officials said that farmers staged a protest without having a clear understanding of the project, and damaged public property. The farmers had thought that the water provided to agriculture purposes would be curtailed due to this project.
