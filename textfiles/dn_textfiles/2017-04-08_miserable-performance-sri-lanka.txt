Miserable performance by Sri Lanka

Hong Kong thrashed Sri Lanka Men's team by a convincing 31 points (5 tries, 3 conversions) to 05 (1 try) at the world rugby 7’s series qualifiers in Hong Kong yesterday after leading 17 points to Nil at Half time.
For the winning Hong Kong team, Benjamin Rimene (two), Max Woodward (two) and Rowan Varty (one) scored the tries while Rimene put over the three conversions.
Speedy winger Anurudda Wilwara scored the solitary try for the Lankan's after covering nearly 75 metres in the final minute of the game. Incidentally Sri Lanka were thrashed by Hong Kong 31 points to nil last month at the Borneo 7s tournament as well.
Earlier in the day Sri Lanka were routed by Chile 38 points to nil in their first game after trailing 12 points to nil at the breather.
Sri Lanka will play Namibia in their last group game today.
Mean while Chile who topped the pool when they beat Namibia 26 – 14 in their final group game for the day and Hong Kong who are in the same pool beat Namibia 22 points to 07 to be placed second. Namibia ended the day as the third placed team in the same pool and Sri Lanka ended the day with a humiliating last place and it was a terribly disappointing performance by them as they only managed to score just one try against Hong Kong in the whole day after losing both games miserably.
