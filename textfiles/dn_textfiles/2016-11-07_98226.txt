CICT funds two international-standard courts at SLTA for wheelchair tennis

Wheelchair tennis in Sri Lanka has received a boost following the development of two international standard hard surface courts at the Sri Lanka Tennis Association (SLTA) by Colombo International Container Terminals (CICT) the full-time principal sponsor of the sport.
The two courts, completely refurbished to international match specifications with funds provided by CICT, were formally commissioned recently at a ceremony attended by representatives of CICT, the SLTA, the Sri Lanka Army and players.
“Supporting wheelchair tennis is part of our extensive corporate social responsibility commitment to Sri Lanka, and we are pleased to see part of the funds we provide being used to develop two courts for disabled players,” CICT CEO Mr Ray Ren said. “CICT’s support to the SLTA’s wheelchair tennis programme is now in its second year, and we have seen tangible results as a result of it.”
