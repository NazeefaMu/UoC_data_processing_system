Robert Nathan in Sinhala

‘Dugee Sitharage Adaravanthiya’ a translation of the novella ‘Portrait of Jennie’ written by American novelist and poet Robert Nathan will be launched at the Colombo International Book Fair at bookstall D168, BMICH on September 21. The book is translated into Sinhala by seasoned author and translator Senaratne Weerasinghe.
‘Portrait of Jennie’ combines romance, fantasy, mystery, and the supernatural. The book is considered a modern masterpiece of fantasy fiction and is the most successful novel penned by the writer.
The story rotates around a struggling Depression-era artist who encounters a young girl in a park. The girl inspires him to paint portraits instead of landscapes. As he repeatedly encounters the girl, each time she is several years older, and is apparently "slipping through time."
The book has been adapted into a film in 1948 and starred Jennifer Jones and Joseph Cotton in the lead roles. It was also adapted as a radio show.
Weerasinghe is well known in the Sri Lankan literary scene.
He has translated many globally acclaimed novels into Sinhala. His translations include novels, short stories and children’s books by writers like Rabindranath Tagore, Kamala Das, Maxim Gorky, Sathyajith Ray, Meera Nayar, Adoor Gopala Krishna, Agatha Christie, Richard Carpenter, Graham Green and others. He has also translated the Nobel Prize winning ‘Good Earth’ trilogy by Pearl S. Buck and the popular Robin Hood series.
