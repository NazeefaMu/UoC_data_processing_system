SLC to announce ICC Champions Trophy squad today

The National Selections Committee of Sri Lanka Cricket headed by Sanath Jayasuriya met at the SLC Headquarters yesterday to select the squad for the forthcoming ICC Champions Trophy 2017.
National captain Angelo Matthews who was in India as a member of the Delhi Daredevils for the ongoing IPL returned to the country early yesterday morning in order to take an active role in the selections of the team that will be led by him.
The selectors adopted a strategic approach and obtained recommendations from the national specialist coaches prior to making their evaluations based on form, fitness, performance and biometric evaluations of the proposed players.
The squad will depart for Kandy on May 9 to participate in a 6-day intensity and altitude training program and will depart Sri Lanka on May 18 to play four practice games prior to taking on the Champions Trophy challenge with their first game against South Africa on June 3.
The team will be announced at a press conference to be held at SLC at 11.00 am today with the attendance of the chairman of selectors and the captain.
