THE HOLY OPPORTUNITY

As the end of Ramadan draws near, Muslims around the world and Sri Lanka will be preparing for Eid, to celebrate the conclusion of the end of the fasting period. Ramadan is the month where good deeds will be done in excess, more praying, more recitation of the Quran and more charity, less gossiping, less backbiting, less lying and so on and so forth.
It is a lot like school, or university, where you strive hard to get the best grades under clinical conditions where all the resources are made available, and then rewarded with a graduation ceremony. Then you are thrown in to the real world, where you would have to find an internship or job, deal with a vicious boss, (or vicious everything) and no one will show your mercy if you display any weakness or incompetency. You will be expected to display the same restrained and tenacity practiced during the university years.
Eid is a lot like that, it is not the end of Ramadan, but the beginning where you display how well you fared throughout the year till the next Ramadan. Eid is about preparing yourself to enjoy the fruits you gained during Ramadan. For example, one should establish contact with an estranged relative during Ramadan, and visit them on Eid. It will be less awkward and the visit will be more qualitative, rather than chancing a sudden visit on Eid day.
Ramadan for most is spiritually clinical, thus rendering it almost impossible to extend the good deeds for more than one month. It is the opportunity to establish a psychological relationship with almighty God which will result in spirituality making our motions of worship more meaningful.
In order to understand the spirit of Eid, the essence of Ramadan must be adhered to, which is three fold. The first being the re-establishment of one’s connection with his Maker, and then through this connection judging one’s own character and begging for repentance of mistakes past, a plea to wipe each slate clean to start afresh. The third element is the recognition of relationship with one’s fellow beings, to mend broken fences in order to spend a united Eid. All of these three dimensions are intertwined to make one’s Ramadan worthwhile.
Thus, Ramadan is not only about Muslims and their spiritual upheaval, it is about recharging, reconnecting and rebuilding what was broken or dented with all of God’s creatures, be it male, or female, Muslim or otherwise.
The holy month of Ramadan is an opportunity for every Muslim to engage in prayers, give in charity and to seek forgiveness from God for the trespasses one does against him. Interestingly, certain trespasses one does against man will not be forgiven by God, till the wrongful seeks the forgiveness of the wronged. In order words, the month of Ramadan compels the faithful to seek out the relatives and friends with whom one has wronged or upset and render an apology.
Positive character traits
Ramadan is also the month where the faithful develops positive character traits, such a punctuality and consistency. From the sighting of the moon announcing the arrival of Ramadan to the times Suhoor (Pre dawn meal) and Ifthar (meal at the breaking of the fast) is partaken, timings and precision plays a colossal part in building positive characteristics.
This enables one to discipline himself and to be conscious of time, a trait developed through thirty days of consistency. Whilst the faithful should engage on extra spiritual deeds and abstain from food and drink they should also focus on developing their personality. Fasting is also the only spiritual deed which another cannot witness, except for God who judges one according to his sincerity. Prophet Muhammad described this connection thus, “Every action of the son of Adam is given manifold reward, each good deed receiving then times its like, up to seven hundred times. Allah the Most High said, ‘Except for fasting, for it is for Me and I will give recompense for it, he leaves off his desires and his food for Me.’ for the fasting person there are two times of joy; a time when he breaks his fast and a time of joy when he meets his Lord, and the smell coming from the mouth of the fasting person is better with Allah than the smell of musk.
Abstaining from food and drink is the core element of Ramadan, in a state of fasting if food or drink enters one’s system the fast is rendered broken. However there are other aspects which also nullify the fast, although not physically, but in spirit. It is incumbent upon the fasting individual to polish his speech and his interaction with others. Rude words, lying, backbiting and slander is utterly discouraged and if engaged in doing so, the faithful is immediately required to seek the forgiveness of the wronged and then God, for slander and backbiting is deemed equitant as to eating the flesh of another human being. These as may not break one’s fast, but it will degenerate the spiritual connection man has with God and also taint his relationship with others, which will block God’s mercy and grace reaching him. Prophet Muhammad said, “If a person does not avoid false talk and false conduct during fasting, then God does not care if he abstains from food and drink.”
In essence, the month of Ramadan transcends religious and racial divisions and functions towards bringing people closer together.
It is a month where not just Muslims but nonMuslims partake in rituals and acts that bind the cord of unity amongst man. A prime example is the ifthar meal, which nonMuslim brethren from all walks of life have at least once hosted an ifthar meal to their Muslim brothers, or joined them for the meal. This act is highly appreciative in God’s eyes, as reflected by the Prophet.
Eid prayer
“He who gives food for a fasting person to break his fast, he will receive the same reward as him, except that nothing will be reduced from the fasting person’s reward.”
The prophet Muhammad used to engage in charity after Eid prayer, encouraging Muslims to share their meals with their family, friends and neighbours.
It is also incumbent upon each Muslim to pay a compulsory poor due zakathul Fitr prior to Eid prayers, so that the less privileged can also enjoy Eid along with their family and friends.
Ramadan dawned upon Sri Lanka in the wake of devastation caused by floods and landslides. For many Muslims, observing Ramadan was a trial as they were displaced and also lost their belongings to floods. Eid is a time for charity and goodwill, which must be shared amongst Muslims and non Muslims alike.
The purpose of compulsory charity, Zakath, is to allow the poor the same dignity of the privileged, diminishing class divisions in society. Yet as Sri Lanka celebrates Eid, there are many who are still languishing in camps due to landslides and floods that occurred last May.
Eid is a time for all to reach out to their fellow Sri Lankans, to extend their support to carry out the Humanitarian call which was evoked in each and everyone of us at the wake of disaster and need. Let’s learn from the spirit of Ramadan which calls for consistency and continuation of good deeds to provide constant support to those who need it as reflected in the humanitarian aid rendered in the immediate aftermath of these disasters.
While we celebrate Eid u Fitr with loved ones and family, let’s remember those who are less fortunate, and extend our love and compassion to them on this blessed day.
