All hail the new generation warrior

Sri Lanka will wake this April Saturday with a new sense of rugby perspective..depending on loyalty and ability to understand the fundamental factors ...life is about to step up beyond predictable and conventional.
For those who hesitate...it’s tough to imagine, but we will try to be as understanding as is legally permissive.
At home it’s all on Joseph’s to confront Royal and find a way to brush away their rapidly increasing self belief, and finishing power.
Coach Lewke, quietly nursing his confidence in forward power and solid finishing.
The Reid Avenue force has not been challenged so far this season, and managed to stamp their class, all over the Singer league.
Joseph’s on the other side of this coin have been growing in performance and look likely contenders for the title.
Friday promises a lung buster....with the alphabet of rugby experience, from start to finish.
Armchair experts within our island shores, will be hard pushed to dangle any scoreline predictions for the two halves?
For what it’s worth, and as a genuine rugby fan ...I think the 1st half will be under 30 points, with both teams itching for a big platform finale in the 2nd half.
Naturally that finish is all on how hard the battle upfront, and how much the Maradana marauders can absorb.
Assuming they front up for 75% of the game…Royal will bite that bullet and use the last quarter...to maximum gain.
I believe it’s all down to those vital stats and unforced errors in the dying 15minutes that will decide the billing.
Patana v Peter’s on Saturday is also at Havies, not under lights, unfortunately...but will set the park stadium alight with furious pace, relentless tackling and an unforgiving attitude, that will grab the oxygen gills Max.
Coach Martis is conscientious about breaking the opposition, before you beat them.
In addition Peter’s have an uncanny knack of pleasing on these top billboard matchups.
But missing out on home advantage for the Bamba brigade might be a telling factor with the green machine just getting into their stride.... Costa’s confidence bound to tested to the hilt and a real litmus test of how either side will shape up as real title contenders.
Wonder if there is a means test to gauge the level of nervous energy with both sets of old boys committees…?
Hope all that pressure is handled...and none imposed on the dressing room pre match protocol?
All told ...a fascinating start April weekend to warm the parts and keep us rugby hearts, utterly hooked!
In Australia, the Gold Coast all dressed up to host the 21st Commonwealth Games starting this weekend...4 to 15.
Sri islanders play 7s this weekend...opening our international quest in Australia vs Olympic champions Fiji.
I can only imagine the pressure keg tournament that defending Games champions South Africa will be hard pressed to protect that title.
Fiji England, New Zealand, Wales, Scotland, Canada and hosts Australia shaping up as holier than most, for the hallowed title.
My goodness, my boots what an energy-efficient 7s line up ...it’s beyond mouth watering and promises those with strong constitutions...pure voltage through their calm brains.
Sri Lanka 7s play Fiji, Wales and Uganda in the league starter ...can Muthuthanthri add magic to these games with Danushka Ranjan, Sooriyabandara, Ratwatte, Ritchie ...build our response and come home with more than the shield....?
All told, not an unreasonable or unrealistic expectation, given the quality of this young warriors unit...My mind racing ...years of travelling around the known green earth, playing 7s for my country...around 14 in total, give me an extra sense of belonging and more pain just considering the task and the pressure.
Blessings to our islanders and may the ocean force be with them.Bula Bula Sri Lanka at the Commonwealth Games 7s.
Pride, respect and belief...always!
