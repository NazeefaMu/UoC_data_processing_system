Two state officials further remanded on bribery charges

The President’s former Chief of Staff I.H.K.Mahanama and former State Timber Corporation (STC) Chairman P.Dissanayake, who were arrested on bribery charges were further remanded until June 19 by Colombo Chief Magistrate Ranga Dissanayake.
The Attorney-at-Law appearing for the suspects pleaded that his clients be granted bail on health conditions.
Bribery Commission officials submitted a further report to the Magistrate.
Earlier, the Bribery Commission’s Assistant Director General (Legal) Asitha Anthony pleaded from the Magistrate that the audio tapes be directed to the Digital Forensics Institute for verification.
The Magistrate ordered the Bribery Commission to refer those audio tapes to the Government Analyst.
Assistant Director General (Legal) Asitha Anthony appearing on behalf of the Commission to Investigate Bribery or Corruption (CIABOC) informed the Magistrate that since the inquiries are not over, the suspects should be further remanded because they can interfere with the inquiries.
The investigation initiated with the complaint that I.K.Mahanama had allegedly demanded a bribe of Rs.540 million from an Indian investor who was ready to acquire a section of the Kantale sugar factory. Mahanama had been attending to this matter of settling the transaction some time ago while he was the Land Ministry Secretary.
However, the Indian investor had refused to pay the sum stating that it was too high and demanded that it be reduced. Within several weeks, they allegedly had agreed to accept Rs.100 million. The two were arrested at a car park of a luxury hotel in Colombo on May 3, by officers of the Commission to Investigate Allegations of Bribery or Corruption, while accepting a bribe of Rs.20 million.
The Magistrate also stated that he would issue an order regarding the bail application at the next hearing and fixed the inquiry for June 19.
