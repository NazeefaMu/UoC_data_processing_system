Qatar Airways recognized for outstanding onboard experience

Qatar Airways was once again recognised for its outstanding on-board experience at the Travel Plus Readers’ Awards ceremony, which took place recently at the Helmut Schmidt Auditorium, Hamburg.
The airline received two product awards - the Gold Award for its First and Business Class bedding set, and the TravelPlus Readers Award for its First and Business Class limited edition pink breast cancer awareness amenity kits.
Qatar Airways Senior Vice President Marketing and Corporate Communications, Ms. Salam Al Shawa, said: “We are especially excited to have received these awards, as they are testament to our commitment to continuous innovation, in order to offer our passengers an onboard experience like no other. We are truly passionate about making our passengers’ experience the best it can be, and will continue to push the boundaries and go that extra mile to make their experience even more special.”
TravelPlus is an independent industry event that celebrates the design excellence of the best onboard amenity kits including First and Business class kits, overnight kits, children’s goody bags, bedding and sleeper suits.
The Qatar Airways First and Business Class sleep collection consists of a quilted mattress, a plush quilted blanket, soft but firm pillow and a message pillow developed by the product development and design team.
The award-winning First and Business class limited edition breast cancer amenity kits were created exclusively for Qatar Airways by luxury Italian luggage brand BRIC’S, in a carefully chosen shade of pink called ‘Rose Pompadour’, featuring a range of skincare products from Castello Monte Vibiano Vecchio to mark the airline’s continuing support of Breast Cancer Awareness Month.
Qatar Airways passengers flying in First Class and Business Class can enjoy luxury amenity kits created exclusively for Qatar Airways by stylish Italian luggage brand BRIC’S. The miniature versions of the Bellagio and Sintesis suitcase features a hard-shell with a Tuscan leather trim.
Each bag contains exclusive products from Italy’s Castello Monte Vibiano Vecchio, the environmentally friendly olive oil company. The skin care range includes lip balm, hydrating facial mist, and anti-ageing moisturiser in Business Class, with added Night Recovery Cream for First Class kits. Socks, eyeshades and ear plugs complete the range with the addition of a BRIC’S signature luggage tag for First Class.
Qatar Airways enjoyed a record-breaking year in 2017, claiming more than 50 individual awards across multiple categories, demonstrating its continued commitment to exceeding passenger expectations with its innovative approach to product development and dedication to customer experience.
