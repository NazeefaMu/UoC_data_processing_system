‘Sri Lanka has progressed in human development, poverty alleviation’

"I am pleased to report to you the success of Sri Lanka’s strategy to reduce poverty of the masses in a systematic manner. Since its Independence, Sri Lanka has adopted a twofold policy of human capital development and poverty alleviation. The country followed a concerted policy of providing rationed food at subsidised prices to the poor and free and equitable access to education and health care for all. Through adopting those policies over the years, Sri Lanka has made a considerable progress, both in human development and poverty alleviation," Social empowerment, Welfare and Kandyan Heritage Minister S. B. Dissanayake said at the third BMISTEC Ministerial meeting on poverty alleviation on December 20 at the BMICH.
The hardcore headcount of poverty has declined to 4.1 percent in 2016, and the unemployment as a percentage of labour force has declined to 4.5 percent. Life expectancy has increased to 75 years, while the annual population increase has been reported at 0.94 percent, infant mortality is 8.2 per 1,000 live births and literacy; 93.2 percent. As a result, the Human Development Index has increased to 0.77 and Sri Lanka has placed 73 among 188 countries in the world. Sri Lanka has reached to a level of a middle-income country with a per-capita income of US $ 3,835 and Purchasing Power Parity (PPP) of US$ 11,417, in 2016, he added.
He further said however, poverty alleviation is at the heart of the Sri Lankan public policy and significant investment has been made in social welfare and poverty reduction in the country. In pursuit of poverty reduction, successive governments since independence have introduced a number of public sector programmes aiming to mitigate poverty, with limited success.
