LECS celebrates 15 years

Creating the perfect opportunities for industries prosper, Lanka Exhibition and Conference Services (Pvt) Ltd. (LECS) has been a true facilitator of trade for well over a decade.
Celebrating 15 years as the pioneer as Sri Lanka’s leading organizer and manager of exhibitions and conferences, LECS continues to bring together buyers and sellers in numerous industries while creating opportunities and pushing forward the development of industries both locally and overseas.
Providing local industries and entrepreneurs a much needed platform for their products, LECS is a well functioning engine which organizes and manages exhibitions and conferences for a rapidly developing MICE (Meetings, Incentives, Conferencing and Exhibitions) tourism industry.
Organizing and managing more than 50 percent of the trade shows in Sri Lanka, LECS has effectively enabled trade associations, government bodies and professional institutions to realize their corporate events and goals.
Established in 2002, LECS met the needs of booming industries in the country as a professional exhibition and conference organizer of Sri Lanka’s largest exhibitions and conferences, despite the limited infrastructure available to host such events in the country.

Facilitating trade through exhibitions such as Profood/Propack & Ag-Biz, Apparel Industry Suppliers Exhibition (AISEX), Jaffna International Trade Fair (JITF), Construction Expo, Adyapana, Thailand Week, Office Expo, Batticaloa International Trade Fair (BITE), Colombo International Tea Convention and Apparel South Asia Conferenc in Sri Lanka, the company has worked towards an extravagant and diverse portfolio.
The only group to organize exhibitions for local industries well beyond the urban limits of Colombo, LECS ensures that products and services of SME’s and rural industries are showcased and have the opportunity to be recognized in a larger market.
Identifying the necessity for their service and tapping in to large industries in the region, LECS has also established offices in neighboring India and Maldives and brought forward projects such as Hotel Asia Exhibition & International Culinary Challenge, Maldives International Education & Career Expo and Maldives International Boat Show.
Setting up Maldives Exhibitions and Conference Services (MECS) and India Exhibitions and Conference Services (IECS) has established a triangle of services in the South Asian peninsula forming the group South Asia Exhibitions and Services (Pvt) Ltd.
The company also looks at ensuring that Sri Lankan products and services are brought into the lime light in untapped markets in the region such as Nepal and Myanmar by organizing exhibitions in these countries.
