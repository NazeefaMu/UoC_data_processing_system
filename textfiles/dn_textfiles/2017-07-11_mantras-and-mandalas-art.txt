Mantras and mandalas on art

Padrig Morin was born in 1962 in the county of Penn ar Bed (Finistère) in Brittany (North-West France). He moved to Sri Lanka in 1986 to study Buddhism and Pali and subsequently settled in the Island.
Padrig’s artistic journey
Padrig has received no formal art education. His first hand at art occurred in his mid-twenties while studying pre-Buddhist India. He started to draw the Hindu Gods in attempt to fix in his memory the gods’ symbols, vehicles, consorts and colors. He had his first solo exhibition at the Alliance Française in 1993 which was followed by 4 group exhibitions and four solo exhibitions. His last three solo exhibits took place at Barefoot.
Hindu gods, mantras and mandalas have been recurrent themes in Padrig’s art. In his last exhibition in 2010, Padrig however explored symbolism mixing elements of Hinduism, Buddhism, Hebrew Kabbalah and Arabic calligraphy, a way to synthesize the various influences he was exposed to during his travels and studies.
Padrig feels that this brought him the maturity to finally express and explore his own Breton cultural identity as translated it in the present exhibition Celtic Soul.
Celtic world
Bretons belongs ethnically, linguistically and culturally to the Celtic world which today survives in Ireland, Scotland, the isle of Man, Wales, Cornwall and Brittany. Bretons are the descendants of Welsh and Cornish people who massively migrated to Armorica (present North West France) between the IV and IX centuries, they renamed their new land Brittany in memory of their native land Britain.
Padrig also signs his painting with the Breton version of his name Patrick. He explained that in 1962 the French ‘law on names’ did not allow parents to give their children regional names especially when a French equivalent existed, so Patrick it was instead of Padrig. A new law allowing regional names was enacted in 1966.
Padrig’s work is being exhibited at the Barefoot Gallery these days. Through this exhibition Padrig wants not only to share the aesthetic, freedom and magic that can be expressed through Celtic art but also a glimpse in the culture and identity of his Breton Nation.
