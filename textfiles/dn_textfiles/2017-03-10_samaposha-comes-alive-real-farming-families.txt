Samaposha comes alive with real farming families

The story of ‘Samaposha’, the favourite breakfast cereal that starts the day for Sri Lanka’s children, is woven around the life of farmers who grow the nutritious grain that goes into producing the product.
Plenty Foods, the subsidiary of Ceylon Biscuits Ltd, launched the outgrower system two decades ago to ensure that the grain used to produce Samaposha is fresh and is of very high quality, especially because it is consumed by the nation’s children as a hurried breakfast.
There is no artificial additives at all in Samaposha which is made of 100% natural and 100% local ingredients.
The backward integration endeavour has proved to be so successful that the areas where the cultivation takes place in far-flung hamlets are visibly thriving. For the farmers who grow the grains, it is much more than a livelihood.
It is a heartfelt commitment and dedication that is reflected in their contented faces. The philosophy of the Samaposha backward integration system is simple. Cultivate and produce quality grain – corn, soya, rice, green gram – and in return Plenty Foods will give back quality of life to the farming families.
Samaposha outgrowers also enjoy benefits such as knowledge sharing that develops their management and cultivation skills, ability to obtain a hassle-free bank loan, emergency assistance in case of an acute need such as damage to the crop from a natural disaster, advisory services and technical assistance at every stage from the initial preparation of the soil to planting the seed right up to the final produce reaching the factory in Pallekelle, Kandy. These are a few of the advantages that keep the farmers contented and smiling.
‘Govi Pawula’ or ‘Farmer Club’ is the five-pronged initiatives powered by Plenty Foods to further uplift the social-economic conditions of these farmers: ‘Govi Denuma,’ enhancing agricultural knowhow; ‘Govi Sarana,’ providing assistance in the hour of need; ‘Govi Sathuta,’ providing social bonding and integration to the farmer community; ‘Govi Suvaya’ that helps them to maintain good health and ‘Govi Arana,’ that meets their religious and spiritual needs.
For the Samaposha farming families, visits from the Company’s field officers and staff are warmly welcomed as though a much loved relative is visiting. A regular visitor is the Plenty Foods Director and Chief Executive Officer Shammi Karunaratne who said “We have been able to establish a strong bond with the farmers because this unique win-win system benefits not only our Samaposha farmers but the entire nation, ensuring high quality nutrition for all, especially children.“
