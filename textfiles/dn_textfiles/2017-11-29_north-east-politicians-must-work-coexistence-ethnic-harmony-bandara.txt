North, East politicians must work for coexistence, ethnic harmony - Bandara

Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) Youth Front Chairman Shantha Bandara urged politicians in the North and East to dedicate and work for coexistence and ethnic harmony.
Similar to politicians in other parts of the country, the politicians in the North and East should also work to build ethnic harmony and coexistence, Bandara said addressing a press conference of the SLFP Youth Front at the SLFP Headquarters yesterday.
“Political leadership of the North and East is duty bound to stand for ethnic harmony. Certain behaviours such as a recent incident of a politician, who refrained from hoisting the National Flag, may harm the coexistence and ethnic harmony. It is a duty of everyone to respect the National Flag and the National Anthem,” he added. Speaking on preparations of the SLFP for the fourthcoming Local Government election, Bandara hopefully said discussions between SLFP and the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) will come to a favourable end. He presumed that the SLFP will obtain a significant victory at the LG polls. He urged the some UNP backbenchers not to criticise the President over the Presidential Commission on Treasury Bond issue. He said the SLFP formed the government with the UNP to bring much benefits to the country and its people. He hoped that most parliamentarians in the Joint Opposition will assist President Sirisena to further strengthen the SLFP.
