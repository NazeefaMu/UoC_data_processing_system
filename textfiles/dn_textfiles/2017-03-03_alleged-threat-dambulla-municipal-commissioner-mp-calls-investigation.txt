Alleged threat to Dambulla Municipal Commissioner: MP calls for investigation

Matale District Parliamentarian Ranjith Aluvihare said he had requested the Central Province DIG to conduct an impartial investigation into the alleged abuse and threats posed to the Dambulla Municipal Commissioner in the presence of police officers.
She was threatened when she went to investigate an alleged encroachment on the Dambulla old cemetery by a person who had trespassed and cleared a part of it, the MP said. He said the police who were at the time had not taken any action.
Addressing a press conference at his residence, Aluvihare said municipal employees staged a demonstration in Dambulla recently against police inaction in this regard.
