Five-judge panel requested for Mahinda’s appeal

Lawyer on behalf of Ranil Wickremesinghe has filed a motion before the Supreme Court requesting a five-member judge panel for the hearing of the appeal of Mahinda Rajapaksa on holding the Prime Minister’s Office.The motion has stated that as the Appeal is constitutionally significant, the matter should be heard before a five-judge panel.The appeal filed against the interim order issued by the Court of Appeal restraining Mahinda Rajapaksa from holding office of Prime Minister and his Cabinet from functioning, is fixed for support tomorrow by the Supreme Court.On December 3, the Court of Appeal issued an interim order restraining Mahinda Rajapaksa and his Cabinet from functioning until the hearing of the Writ of Quo Warranto filed against them is concluded.The 122 MPs who had signed the Writ of Quo Warranto petition, against Mahinda Rajapaksa holding office as Prime Minister, have been named as respondents in the appeal.Meanwhile, another motion has been filed at the Supreme Court by 122 MPs who are named respondents of the appeal, requesting the relevant appeal not to be heard before Judge Eva Wanasundara in fear of a biased judgement.They have requested the Supreme Court to remove Judge Wanasundara from the judge panel and the appeal be heard before another judge panel.
