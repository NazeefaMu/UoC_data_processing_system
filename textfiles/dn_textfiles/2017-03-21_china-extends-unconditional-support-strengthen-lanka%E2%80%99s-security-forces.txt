China extends unconditional support to strengthen Lanka’s security forces

Visiting Chinese State Councillor and Defence Minister General Chang Wanquan yesterday extended China’s unconditional and open-ended support for strengthening Sri Lanka’s security forces.
China’s Defence Minister General Chang met President Maithripala Sirisena and State Defence Minister Ruwan Wijewardena.
The meeting between General Chang and and State Defence Minister Wijewardena took place at the Defence Ministry, Colombo.
General Chang pledged China’s unconditional backing for Sri Lanka’s military during the meeting.
He said China will continue to provide military training opportunities, military hardware and technological knowledge to Sri Lanka as its long-standing friend.
State Defence Minister Ruwan Wijewardena emphasised the support rendered by China over the past few decades to Sri Lanka for the development of the country’s economy and the strengthening of its security forces.
Wijewardena remembered the support extended by China to defeat terrorism.
Meanwhile, Foreign Affairs Ministry sources said Chinese Defence Minister General Chang’s visit was a scheduled visit, and not a sudden visit as some newspapers have erroneously alluded. He will leave for Nepal today.
