Presidential Commission to probe CB bond issue questionable: NSSP

Nava Sama Samaja Party (NSSP) leader Dr. Wickramabahu Karunaratne yesterday said it was questionable how ethical it was to appoint a Presidential Commission to probe the Central Bank bond issue.
He said it looked like the President was following the former President's footsteps.
Addressing a press conference at the party office in Colombo yesterday, he said all who contributed towards the January 8 victory, say the President should take steps in connection with the bond issue after discussing with the Prime Minister.
Dr. Karunaratne said the President has the right to condemn homosexuality and lesbianism based on the values and ethics of the country.
"The world may think that Sri Lanka does not treat people equally and discriminate some. Even prostitutes attained Arahathship during the Buddha's time. Even Buddhism does not reject LGBT rights," he added.
