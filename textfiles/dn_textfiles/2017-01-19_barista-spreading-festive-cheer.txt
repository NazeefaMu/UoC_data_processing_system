Barista  spreading  festive cheer

Barista, the first coffee bistro in Sri Lanka, recreated a world of magic for the children of the SMI Child Care Centres by inviting them for an evening of fun and laughter at their signature Café Mocha outlet located in Colombo 05.
Speaking about the day’s events a spokesperson from the Barista team said, “Through our community outreach programme ‘Coffee, That Gives’ we were been able to add some joy to lives of the children at the SMI Child Care Centre. It was very touching to see the excitement on their faces as the day’s events commenced; something that really got everyone’s attention was the magic show. We at Barista strongly believe that the festive season is more about giving and being able to see the smiles on children’s faces.”
The Barista Christmas party was a much-anticipated event and fun for all that attended, with a visit by Santa Claus who brought along with him a bag full of presents and goodies for the little ones. Team Barista along with the children from SMI, played musical chairs and a host of other games; thereafter while indulging in some scrumptious treats from Barista Café Mocha they watched in awe as a magician performed trick after trick. The evening concluded with the children displayed their talents, by singing much loved Christmas Carols.
Barista, as a socially responsible food chain, has year on year carried out programmes to give back to society and benefit those less privileged. With their community reach project ‘Coffee, That Gives’ in previous years the staff at Barista came together to collect funds to support the needs of students at the Niyadhagala Vidyalaya, a remote school in the village of Kumaragama, Thanamalwila. In 2016 the team at Barista was able to purchase 125 school supply packs which included a school bag, uniform material, lunch box, water bottle, exercise books and other stationary material. With the knowledge of the difficulties of the community, Barista also included a gift voucher of Rs.1000 for shoes.
