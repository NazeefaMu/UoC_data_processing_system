‘No significant impact of Dengue Vaccination during ongoing outbreak’

The Dengue Vaccination (CYD–TDV ‘Dengvaxia’) is not expected to have a significant impact during the course of an ongoing outbreak, World Health Organization Representative to Sri Lanka Dr. Razia Pendse said.
Addressing a Media Workshop on Dengue Prevention, Control and Management organised by the WHO and the Health Ministry held at the Government Information Department Auditorium on Thursday, she said countries should consider the introduction of CYD-TDV only in geographic settings (national or sub national) where epidemiological data indicate a high burden of disease.
“Zero prevalence should be approximately 70 percent or greater in the age group targeted for vaccination,”Dr.Pendse said. According to Dr. Pendse, the vaccine is not recommended when zero prevalence is below 50 percent in the age group targeted for vaccination. Dengue vaccine introduction should be a part of a comprehensive dengue control strategy, including well-executed and sustained vector control, evidence-based best practices for clinical care for all patients with dengue illness, and strong dengue surveillance.
