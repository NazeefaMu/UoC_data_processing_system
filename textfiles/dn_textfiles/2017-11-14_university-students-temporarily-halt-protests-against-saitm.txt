University students temporarily halt protests against SAITM

 
The government medical faculty undergraduates will re-attend lectures from the November 20, 2017 as the issue of South Asian Institute of Technology and Medicine (SAITM) has received satisfactory solutions, Convener of the Medical Faculty Student’s Action Committee (MFSAC) Rayan Jayalath today said.
Responding to Daily News, Jayalath further said the re-attendance does not mean that they have given up on their battle against SAITM.  
Since there were favourable solutions forwarded, he said they decided to cooperate. 
“However, we are not hundred present satisfied with the solutions given. This also does not mean our protests will completely cease. We are waiting until the government implements these proposed solutions soon. We won’t allow them to bid time for a way out, from applying these solutions to this issue.” Jayalath explained.
