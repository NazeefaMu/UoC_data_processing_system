quarantine spoils  Kuwaiti couple’s  pooches’ sojourn

Five Customs officials were admitted to hospital after a Kuwaiti couple allegedly assaulted them at the Bandaranaike International Airport yesterday over their pet dog.
These officials have come under attack after they informed the Kuwaiti couple to quarantine their pet dog who flew in with them.
Customs sources said that this couple who had arrived at the airport yesterday morning with their pet dog refused to abide by animal quarantine regulations.
Airport sources said that a heated argument ensued between Customs officials on duty after this couple tried to leave the airport with their pet dog disregarding quarantine regulations.
The couple had then begun to assault the Customs officers on duty. The injured were later admitted to the Negombo Hospital. However, the couple and the pet dog were held by the airport police on being informed by Custom officials.
A Deputy Customs Director and a female are also among the injured. The Kuwaiti couple was produced before the Magistrate yesterday evening.
