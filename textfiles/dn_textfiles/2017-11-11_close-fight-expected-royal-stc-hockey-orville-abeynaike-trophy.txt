Will the Thomians break the 10-year hoodoo to win back the Orville Abeynaike trophy this year? That’s the question being asked by all and for which the answer will be known when the two great schools confront each other at the 18th annual Royal-Thomian hockey encounter for the Orville Abeynaike trophy to be worked off at the Astro turf Colombo today at 4.15pm. S.Thomas’ College dominated the series winning the first seven years while Royal came back strongly winning the encounters continuously since 2007 and have been able to retain the shield since then.
This year Royal led by centre half Pasindu Charuka will face a great challenge by Thomians led by T.N Dela. Both sides are brimming with confidence after the respective teams performing exceptionally well at the local tournaments.
In addition to the Orville Abeynaike trophy to be awarded to the winners, there will be a trophy awarded to the most outstanding player of the match.
The under 15 match between the both schools will commence at 2.00pm while the old boys match for the Nihal Nilaweera memorial trophy will be played at 3.00 pm
All in all an absorbing contest for supremacy is on the cards and will no doubt give a great entertainment to the large crowd that is expected to be present.
