Dhoni breaks Sangakkara’s wicket-keeping record

Indian wicket-keeper Mahendra Singh Dhoni playing in his 301st match became the first wicket-keeper in one-day international cricket history to affect 100 stumpings when he stumped Sri Lanka’s Akila Dananjaya off Yuzvendra Chahal during the fifth ODI played at the R Premadasa Stadium yesterday. The previous record of 99 stumpings was held by Sri Lanka wicket-keeper Kumar Sangakkara who played for his country in 404 ODIs.
Third in the list is another Sri Lankan Romesh Kaluwitharana with 75 stumpings.
