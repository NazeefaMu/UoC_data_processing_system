Removal of girl from school:
Principal has acted in an irresponsible manner: Minister

Education Minister Akila Viraj Kariyawasam requested the Education Ministry Secretary for an investigation report on the removal of a girl from school accused of being pregnant.
The 15-year-old girl was removed from the school she was studying at Kekirawa by the Principal accusing her of being pregnant on a pre-judgment as she had been vomitting in school. However, medical tests carried out by the Dambulla acting JMO Gamini Senanayake had proved that the said girl was a virgin and not pregnant.
The Education Minister told the Daily News, that it has been observed that the principal had acted in an irresponsible manner. The Minister had later called for a report on this inhuman issue from the Education Ministry Secretary.
“Principals and teachers should clearly understand that sacking a girl from schools was not the answer to any issue. Schools are meant to guide and direct students on the correct path,” the Minister told the Daily News.
On a request of the Education Secretary, the Provincial Education Director has said that the services of the Principal would be suspended in due course on charges of irresponsible behaviour. Besides, a provincial level separate investigation was also being carried out into the case.
