Sajith promises buses for eight Hambantota schools

Minister of Housing and Construction Sajith Premadasa, addressing a meeting at Yodakandiya public market premises recently, said that those who distributed various benefits among their family members do not like distributing such benefits to those who deserve them.
He said that to mark his birthday every year, he declares a fortnight of welfare and development programmes in Hambantota district, but he was unable to do it this year due to various obstacles.
The Minister said that there were requests from eight schools to provide them with school buses. The request came from teachers, students and parents. He said there were eight buses opposite his Weerawila residence for distribution after the local government elections. Election rules and regulations prevented him from distributing these buses before February 10.The present regime will be in power for three more years; as such people must vote for the ruling parties because it was the ruling parties that could serve the people most during this period.
The minister added that he will try his best to solve the housing problem and provide jobs for the unemployed youth in the district.
