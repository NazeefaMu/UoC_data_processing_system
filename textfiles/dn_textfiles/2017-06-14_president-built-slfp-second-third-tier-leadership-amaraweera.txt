President built SLFP second, third tier leadership: Amaraweera

Late Prime Minister S.W.R.D. Bandaranaike built up several prominent figures in the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) to take over the party leadership after him.
Ever since, President Maithripala Sirisena is the only party leader, who has built up a second and third tier leadership in the SLFP suitable to takeover the party mantle, Fisheries and Aquatic Resources Development Minister and Mahaweli Development State Minister Mahinda Amaraweera said. He was addressing a meeting held at Middeniya on June 11.
The Minister said the SLFP has several leaders in its front-line along with President Sirisena. “They are Ministers Nimal Siripala de Silva, W.D.J. Seneviratne, Susil Premajayantha and Anura Priyadharshana Yapa. The second tier leadership in the SLFP includes Duminda Disanayake, Lakshman Yapa Abeywardene, Dilan Pererra, Vijayamuni Soysa, Dayasiri Jayasakera and Peshala Jayaratne. Several youth leaders were also being built up in the SLFP today including Anuradha Jayaratne and Taranath Basnayake. Many other young parliamentarians were also contributing towards the effort to steer the SlFP forward,” Amaraweera said.
“Today the SLFP was moving forward from strength to strength. Another section was clamouring to break up the SLFP. History proved that those who tried to divide the SLFP were always doomed. No one would be allowed to break up the SLFP. The ordinary masses loved and followed the SLFP like a religion,” he said.
“The UNP-SLFP consensus government was able to restore within two years the image of the country which had earlier been relegated to pariah status. The government was able to gain many other victories for the country including the GSP plus facility.
“The country today had no enemies because all countries treated it as a friend,” he said.
Minister Amaraweera said he believed that the UNP-SlFP partnership would continue for the next four years too on the strength of the victories it gained to date.
He said his role as the UFPA General Secretary was to foster unity among all its partners.
