Son of former Pakistan cricketer commits suicide

Mohammad Zaryab, the Pakistani cricketer, has committed suicide after being dropped from Karachi U19 team. He was the son of the former cricketer of the country Amir Hanif who represented Pakistan in five One-Day Internationals in the 1990s.
Zaryab was a talented batsman and was expecting a call-up to the side for the upcoming tournament. However, he was dropped by the selectors citing that he was over-aged for the U19 cricket.
The youngster was left heartbroken over his expulsion from the team and hanged himself to death. Zaryab was the first-year student at a college and the oldest son of Hanif. He recently represented Karachi in a U19 cricket tournament in Lahore.
Though he was sent back home due to an injury with an assurance from the coaches that he would be selected again according to reports, Mohammad Zaryab had resisted the move of him being sent back home as the injury to him was not so serious.
The father of the cricketer and the former Pakistan cricketer Amir Hanif confirmed the news of his dejected son committing suicide after not being selected in the U19 team. He claimed that the coaches in the team had pressurised Zaryab a lot while he was in the team and this is what has forced to kill himself.
“My son was pressurised, he was told he was over-age. The coaches’ behaviour towards him forced him (to kill himself),” he said according to Pakistan Today.
Hanif also urged that steps should be taken in order to save the lives of other budding cricketers in the country.
“My son was disappointed with the attitude of the coaches. We should take steps to save others’ sons,” he added.
According to the official website of the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB), Mohammad Zaryab’s current age is 18 years and 158 days and by no means he was overage to play in the U19 team. The funeral prayers of the deceased was offered on Tuesday.
