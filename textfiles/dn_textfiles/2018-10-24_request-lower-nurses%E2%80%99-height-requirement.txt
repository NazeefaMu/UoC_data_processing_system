Request to lower nurses’ height requirement

Under the direction of Health Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne, the Health Ministry has made a request to the Public Service Commission to lower the required height for recruitment of nurses, Media Director to the Health Ministry Prasanna Adhikarai said.
The required height at present for recruiting a nurse to the service is 147.3 centimetres. The request is to lower the height to 145 centimetres (4.75 feet) in order to recruit 121 applicants who cannot meet the current required height.
Minister Senaratne has paid special attention to the issue and informed Deputy Director General Donald Murage to look into it, Adhikari said.
