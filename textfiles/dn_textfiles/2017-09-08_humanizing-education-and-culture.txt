HUMANIZING EDUCATION  AND CULTURE

The Government holds a monopoly in Education which is called ‘free education’ because education in government and other government assisted institutions is given without any charge. Yet in practice, the quality of education given is such that even after taking tuition at a heavy price it still remains a stumbling block alienating the students from the rest of the world, due to the vernacular languages of instruction.
In Sri Lanka, due to the governments, whether of the UNP or SLFP or UNP-SLFP, not being able to tackle and solve several problems in education, people and communities do not connect and while staying so close remain so far from one another.
The downgrading of English has also been another barrier to reconciliation and therefore to humanization. Nor has the government been able to improve the quality of the teachers in schools in rural areas so that the desire of parents to opt for far-away urban schools may be avoided.
The successive Governments have also not specified what kind of monopoly it holds over what order of education even after the spiteful and ill-considered take-over of the denominational schools and vesting them in the Government on October 24, 1960 for a purported ‘unified national system of education’ which has remained vague.
The lack of clarity over the manner of the Government’s overall direction and setting guidelines to all academic, technical and professional standards of education in Sri Lanka and the freedom in education has not only hindered the progress of education, it has prevented the beneficial participation of other stakeholders in education and contributed to the over-commercialization of education with the profit-motive as a driving force.
At a certain stage in human development, human beings abandoned the unsettled life of hunting for livelihood and took to the settled life of agriculture, cultivating the land for grain and vegetables. ‘Culture’ is derived from agriculture. To be cultured as a human person is to be well ‘cultivated’, to be well bred and knowledgeable, able to be outgoing and relate to other human beings on an equal level, to be always peaceable, truthful, honest, sincere, just, virtuous and to be appreciative of what is good and honourable, to have an aesthetic sense, to be refined and noble in thought, word and deed, to be reliable and fraternal as a human person
Today the government by law compels parents to send their children to a school where they have imparted instructions according to set syllabi and their minds fed with information. Government schools have a set regimen and a broadly stereotype school curricula at primary and secondary level grades.
But the governments cannot / should not monopolize the learning process of human beings at any stage of their lives or in any kind of environment or institution nor hinder new initiatives in the field of education.
TEACHERS: HUMANIZING LEADERS
While school and university environment should have its own discipline and concerns including the ecological, there should not be over compartmentalization and rigid regimentation that could dehumanize some individuals. Bullying and ragging should have no place at all in educational institutions. Nor should school education leave some students behind as a result of inadequate attention to them by the teachers.
It is through careful attention to all the students that attentive teachers could discern in the student’s other qualities beyond the academic and observe the talents, gifts, and abilities the development of which could enhance their humanness and lead them into alternative spheres of study and work essential to any community. To be gifted with other talents is not to be less remarkable.
At present, the humanizing and leadership qualities of the teachers in educational institutions have not been given sufficient attention. The overall school environment in which students indeed learn, the pedagogical methods and the indispensable role of leadership of the teacher that humanizes education has not been focused on. As a result, the school turns out to be like an impersonal bureaucratized educational factory rather than an institution with a family spirit. When parents cannot have meaningful contacts with the teachers and those in charge of students, the school environment is less human, it becomes impersonal, anonymous and even bureaucratic.
The politicization of education and the foolish understanding and emphasis on irrational prestige have made some schools far too large. Some far too small schools without well-trained teachers and sufficient facilities have been founded to satisfy narrow partisan appetites of local politicians.
The legislation, lack of sound educational policy and planning, party politics and far-too-big schools have complicated education and distorted pedagogical principles to the detriment of the humanization of education; humanization is the all round physical, intellectual, spiritual, ethico-moral, social and human development of all the students without anyone getting left behind. Our universities at least have not grown far-too-big. This is indeed helpful for all the students and staff to be ‘university minded’ and have fruitful inter-faculty academic and other relations. Whether/how meaningful inter-faculty academic and intellectual relations are cultivated and time-wasting and destructive political protests drastically curtailed need to be examined. The relations and tensions between the university and society at large should be healthy and not destructive.
The university dons who have greatly influenced students and are appreciated for their contribution to university education and overall intellectual contribution and cultural enhancement of the country are those who have been also humanizing the university education environment and consequently society at large. It is sad if such university teachers of high calibre, who not only could contribute with their advice on many a national question and uplift the whole of the national community and are embodiments of valuable aspects of culture, are not remunerated sufficiently. Foreign universities remain a constant attraction to them for more than one reason.
Education should not only equip the educated person to be an integrally developed person with developed abilities and skills that are useful and needed by society but also develop such a person to be civically and socio-politically responsible. This means that he is concerned not only about his own and his family’s well-being but also about the affairs and the common good of the larger community.
WELL-BRED HUMAN BEINGS
To be humanized is to be bred, cultivated and disciplined in those basic qualities that enhance the human being and keep him always refined and cultured in his conversation, inter-personal relations, conduct, and behaviour. Such persons have minds and hearts; they are understanding, humble and compassionate; they could be persuasive with their intellectual sharpness, uplifting without being snobbish, are never arrogant or haughty; they never exploit or manipulate others for self-gain; they often strive to be accommodative without compromising on principles.
Every teacher trained to excel in the role of humanization while exemplifying with her / his own life all that is of human worth and honour, should be able to say to their students, as in the Book of Proverbs, “My Son/daughter, listen to my words and accept guidance with a will, for they will be a crown of grace for your head and a garland of grace for your neck” (Book of Proverbs 23.26; 1.9). Those who have not listened then to their parents and teachers at home and school, now, even as elected representatives do not listen to the people but act imprudently according to their whims and earn disgrace.
When education has humanized all who have been educated, all are equal and free, all are responsible, relate well to one another and are civic minded. They do not neglect their social duties nor look for loop-holes to escape liability, accountability, and answerability over their obligations to society.
Those involved in the abuse of power, corruption, Bond scams, evasion of taxes, issues of conflicts of interest and trade-union blackmailing of poor citizens as done by the GMOA, could be considered as people who have dehumanized themselves through an education with many flaws. Paradoxically and regrettably they consider themselves adept in politics, economics, finance, banking, medicine, law, and diplomacy when they are nothing but experts in conning, swindling, deceiving; they are hypocrites and whitened sepulchres.
PROJECT NEEDING ATTENTION
At a certain stage in human development, human beings abandoned the unsettled life of hunting for livelihood and took to the settled life of agriculture, cultivating the land for grain and vegetables. ‘Culture’ is derived from agriculture. To be cultured as a human person is to be well ‘cultivated’, to be well bred and knowledgeable, able to be outgoing and relate to other human beings on an equal level, to be always peaceable, truthful, honest, sincere, just, virtuous and to be appreciative of what is good and honourable, to have an aesthetic sense, to be refined and noble in thought, word and deed, to be reliable and fraternal as a human person.
To humanize our culture means to endow all human beings in our national community with the qualities of well-bred and responsible human beings. This has to be brought about in our homes and in all other places and institutions where education is imparted.
It is only from a well humanized education and cultured national community that we could expect to have good legislators, good judicial officers, good administrators, good professionals, good citizens in our society, who will not create social confusion and intractable problems for others but who will help order all things as well as they could and as well as they should for all to live happy and peaceful lives. Therefore, the project of humanizing education and culture is a project to which we should all give sufficient and careful attention.
