Judy Wikkramatillake wins  ‘Woman Entrepreneur of the Year’ Award

The Women’s Chamber of Industry and Commerce (WCIC) presented Judy Wikkramatillake of Rocco’s with Gold Award in the Large Category at their annual felicitation ceremony held on August 4 at the Grand Marquee, Hotel Taj Samudra, Colombo.
WCIC is a non-profit organization which acts as a powerful voice for change and a platform for improving the business environment for remarkable women entrepreneurs.
The awards recognize women who through their own initiative, ability and effort, have made an exemplary achievement in their field, women who are outstanding role models because of their goals and the way they have achieved these goals. Whether recognized as trailblazers in their field, or a young woman on the rise, all are pathfinders, bringing forth the key issues facing Sri Lankan women.
Chief Guest at the ceremony was Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe together with guest of honor Mayor Rosy Senanayake and Minister of Women and Child Affairs Chandrani Bandara.
On receiving her award from Minister of Sports, Provincial Councils and Local Government, Faizer Mustapha, Judy said, “I wouldn’t be here if not for the support of my friend and business partner, Joint Managing Director Krishanti Perera, whose whole hearted contribution has led to the restaurant’s success; nor would it be possible without the firm implementing of our values into its everyday operations. We have a committed team of wonderful staff members, both past and present, who support our vision.”
“Celebrating our 6th Anniversary, this accomplishment gives recognition to the hard work that has gone into building the Rocco’s brand and acknowledges our passion for good food and people,” she added.
Co-owned by two friends Judy Wikkramatillake and Krishanti Perera, Rocco’s story began with a pizza oven constructed in Krishanti’s garden, subsequently shifting to a main road frontage building in Nawala in August 2013.
They both share a passionate love for good food with a penchant for Italian cuisine. Krishanti, with her people’s skills in addition to her talents in back office administration, maintains a good rapport with customers and creates that warm and welcoming vibe that has made Rocco’s popular.
On the other hand Judy, with her eye for detail overlooks the preparation and quality. With their integrity, honesty, faith and trust in each other, they truly complement one other.
Rocco’s brand has flourished due to their emphasis on sourcing only fresh, highest quality local and imported gourmet ingredients which are cooked in a home-style fashion. While offering a large product portfolio of traditional Italian and Western fusion food, Rocco’s excel in authentic artisan pizzas baked in a wood-fired oven.
