Breaking the ice for mega foreign investment projects

With the dawn of another year, the country has embarked on a number of ambitious projects in many parts of the country. The vital aspect for the success of these projects lies in the evaluation, negotiation and convincing of stake holders including the public.
All political parties need to pull in one direction for the development in this country. In the eighties Thailand, Singapore, Taiwan, Malaysia, Hongkong and recently Vietnam, the political scenario was conducive for rapid foreign investment promotion.
They built the infrastructure quickly and invited the foreign investors to invest on terms favourable for those countries. We were very slow in building our infrastructure and wasted tax payer money on an unwanted war, mismanagement of state enterprises, ”thamashas”, every year elections and massive corruption which resulted in continuous annual budget deficits. We cannot afford a large number of politicians. Right now we have 225 members of parliament, nearly 500 provincial councilors and nearly 4,500 local government politicians with majority engaging in corrupt practices looting the country from the very first day in office.
In addition their staff, security personnel, family members and friends help themselves with perks, luxury vehicles, bribes, kick backs and other privileges. All in all around 30,000 people loot the resources of this country in every government.
In addition, they help their supporters by providing them with non existent jobs in the state sector adding to the salary and pension bills of the country. We never had systems or good governance from the time of independence upto now. Sad to say, the main political parties looted this country taking turns.
The development drive of this country has two main eras, i.e. before the commencement of north east hostilities and after the cessation of hostilities. The first period moved at a very slow pace and the government which came to power in 1977 could have concluded all infrastructure developments in their first period of 6 years, including highways, roads, power supply, telephone lines, ports and airports.
Unfortunately, they were sitting ducks. Funds were available as grants and long term soft loans with very low interests and grace periods. One must not forget the contributions of Ministers Gamini Dissanayake and Lalith Athulathmudali in infrastructure development. But the others did not make a worthwhile contribution. Post 2009 May funding attracted commercial rates.
As a country with a substantial budget deficit we cannot afford high debt servicing. Hence consumers were burdened with a variety of taxes including the Value added tax. We experienced Vat fraud, oil hedging, Low quality petrol, Norochcholai power plant breakdowns, tax amnesties and are now going through controversies in central bank bonds, low quality rice, coal tenders, drug rackets and so on.
This will never stop until we quickly develop systems for good governance, monthly internal audits and the immediate establishment of the Audit Commission, rigid budgetary control and hiring of experienced professionals for tax collection at inland revenue, excise department and at customs and most importantly reduction in the number of members in provincial councils and local government instituitions.
However, there are talks to increase the number of local government members to over 6,000 and a 25% reservation to the fairer sex. Whatfor?
They will fight amongst themselves for personal wealth accumulation totally neglecting the people.
No foreign/local investor will come to Sri Lanka since they will have to pay bribes first to get the projects approved and then in running their projects. Crime rate will automatically go up due to political rivalry. Even the JVP wanted to bring in amendments as far as the qualifications to contest elections in 2015 beginning. Now they too are silent on this. Where are we heading?
Now let us consider the present difficulties in getting the mega development projects of the country approved. Each political party commits more grave mistakes and bunglings citing the misdeeds of the previous government. A workable formula and a criteria in approving the mega development projects for the country is outlined below in brief. Commitment to resolve by all parties is a must.
We now have a police commission, finance commission and a constitutional council to study and analyse core areas of the country. Similarly we should set up an economic development committee consisting of 10 members including the president, Prime Minister, subject minister and leaders of parties representing the parliament, including the joint opposition.
This committee should meet every week and reach mutual agreements on all mega projects followed by a press conference to explain matters in a more organized manner to instill confidence in the minds of public and residents of the area. All ideologies such as capitalism, socialism, communism, Marxist and other ideologies should reach a common understanding for sustained economic development of the country considering the grave plight our country is in now.
Media heads should be appraised of the progress and decisions reached by this committee and be requested to report on an impartial manner. The recent examples of differences of opinion among political parties, clergy and other organisations are creating chaos and uncertainty on the part of foreign investors. They will think twice before investing in Sri Lanka. The financial, technical and environmental evaluations are of paramount importance.
After this, the proposed above committee should go through the recommendations on a daily basis and come to a conclusion and reach agreement with the foreign investors within 2 to 4 weeks. The evaluation committee should act in the best interest of the country rather than on personal wealth boosting or to serve the interests of their respective political parties. No public protests, marches and expressions of opinion be allowed until the committee makes its decision.
Leaders of political parties could appraise their fellow parliamentarians and advise them not to engage in protest campaigns in the common interest of the country. The members of parliament could forward their recommendations to their party representative at the committee and get feedback after every sitting of this committee. Loss of FDI opportunities will reroute the FDI flow to other countries like Vietnam, Myanmar and other south Asian countries who are in competition with Sri Lanka for foreign direct investments.
The media both electronic and print have a big role to play in this context rather than filling up sensational stories for their respective media routes. Upto 1992 we had only 2 major TV channels in the country, namely, SLRC, ITN and one radio station, namely SLBC.
However, with the escalation of war media organisations mushroomed since the general public placed reliance and a liking for private media to receive facts, especially on war since they felt that the governmental media sources are not coming out with the true stories.
As the literacy levels of people in remote areas are at a low level, they always look for sensational stories to get themselves engaged in talking about them on a daily basis. This also brought down the productivity standards of the country as well. Even now private media highlight stories of political background & crime in their daily news roundup and news bulletins. One can compare the news bulletins of developed countries such as UK, USA, European countries with that of our country and see the difference. A foreigner staying in Sri Lanka will realize the stupidity of our people and the members of political parties. Prior to end of war, the news bulletins of both state and private media reported over 80% of their news coverage on war& explosions.
Now let us consider some of the recent mass protests for development projects. Norochcholai power plant attracted lot of criticism. Inaddition, Hambantotta port and airport, Southern Highway, Sampur Power Plant also attracted many thoughts. All these projects should have been discussed jointly by all political parties with a view of getting the best deal for our country from the foreign investors. Privatisation of AirLanka and the handing over of management rights to Emirates in 1998 also drew a major debate at the parliament.
Instead a parliamentary commission could have discussed matters and reached an optimum solution. Sri Lanka telecom was another institution where conflict situations arose. Right now Sri Lanka Telecom is doing well and the public are benefitted by their rapid and efficient services. Strategic alliance of Sri Lanka Telecom with an overseas partner enabled the provision of telephone connections to a large number with great value addition.
In the pre 1990 era telephone landline was a luxury and it took sometimes years for a member of the public to get a telephone connection to the residence or to a business premises. The Matara Colombo Highway is netting high turnovers and the motorists and the general public save around three hours of valuable time in reaching their destinations.
To avoid all these problems it is far better to approach all development projects on an “early bird” basis. with the subject minister meeting foreign investor to discuss the core areas such as project cost, funding, land requirements, environmental concerns, employment creation and then discuss same without delay with the president and the prime minister. The trio would then decide on the terms of the agreement with the foreign investor and discuss same with the investor. If agreement is reached between all parties, the subject minister will proceed to prepare a cabinet paper showing the advantages of the project with an estimated forex flow statement.
The cabinet approval should be immediately followed up by an all party meeting to discuss the project, including the joint opposition. Inputs further required to the terms could be discussed at length by the same committee within 2 weeks to reach finality. The foreign investor will be briefed immediately on new suggestions and a draft agreement could be presented at the next all party meeting to ratify the amended draft agreement. By this way the project approval will not be necessary by the parliament involving lengthy debates suiting political agendas. The project will kick start within weeks if the project approval is carried out in this manner.
Ruling governments should devise methodologies to avoid confrontations with other political parties and general public in carrying out mega investment projects in the country.
A job bank should also be created to recruit the most suitable staff for the projects including the unemployed graduates/diploma holders. Top financial experts should be employed to handle the financial control of the project backed up by an efficient internal audit unit working in the night time also, if required. Political appointments should be totally done away with in recruiting staff. Round the clock security be also provided to the project until completion and for smooth functioning.
Attaining unit be opened by the foreign investor for the local staff also briefing them of working ethics prior to employing them. The workers should be given the best of working conditions and welfare measures.
The project profile should include the following evaluative criteria amongst others.
1. Lease period
This period should not be lower than the periods offered by other FDI seeking countries in Asia such as Vietnam, Myanmar, India, Bangladesh and others.
2. Quantum of Initial forex down payment
3. Liquidated damages clause in the agreement for both parties.
4. Arbitration clause
5. The proportion of foreign direct labour to be engaged in the project, by the foreign investor
6. Adherence to environmental laws of the country
7. Adherence to local by-laws of the country
8. Mode of project---BOO/BOT basis
9. Liability to local taxes and tax rebates/exemptions offered
10. Compensation payable to state/private owners for the land
11. Status of project Joint Venture, Limited Liability Company or other form
12. Introduction of hitherto unused technology in Sri Lanka
13. Threat to local industries
14. Threat to farmers and agricultural output of the country
15.Availability of suitable infrastructure to undertake the project
16. Impact on external/local debt burden of the country
17. Disturbance to any place of religious worship, educational institute or other social project
18. Green effects of the project and possible environmental pollution
19. Number of Technical/consultancy staff to be brought in by the foreign investor and the visa. Requirements to remain in the country until project completion and after
20. A direct forex inflow/outflow during the project period and for the first 10 years after completion
21. A local cash flow statement in rupees both before and after completion of project in local currency
22. Effects on local currency and possible depreciation of rupee
23. Level of straining of relationships with neighbouring countries and super powers of the world
24. Viability of the project and feasibility study prepared by a top accountancy firm in Sri Lanka
25. High tech Security requirements of the project
26. Rate of interest for foreign funding
27.Rate of interest on any state sponsored loans
Brainstorming sessions be held to sort out inadequacies in above criteria to sign the agreement with the foreign investors. This process will avoid all misunderstandings with the parties involved and pave the way for early approval of all mega foreign investment projects. It is always advisable to seek alternative offers from different countries before finalization of the most suitable investor. Flexibility on the part of the foreign investor in meeting the above criteria and requirements is vital to maintain a cordial relationship.
The foreign investors should understand the cultural, social, religious and political backgrounds and make an honest endeavor to offer s Sri Lanka with the best possible terms and conditions to engage in the project with a view of assistance to Sri Lanka while meeting their returns on investment.
Our youth should take blame for not applying for semi skilled and unskilled jobs in the private sector and the private sector is now faced with a severe labour shortage especially for the construction industry as our youth have got used to easy jobs like security personnel, peons, delivery boys.
Some lease out three wheelers adding upto the already exceeded three wheelers on streets and they run without meters and charge fancy amounts from the general public who use their services. As a result we are in need of foreign labour for our essential development projects even.
I wish to mention the very favourable strategic location of our country in terms of global trade and global defence needs. Sri Lanka is perched at the middle of the world and has a very high percentage of English speaking population when compared to other Asian and African countries. Western music and films are followed by a vast number of youth, middle aged and senior citizens.
Other than USA and UK, Sri Lanka comes high in the table where western music and films are followed. Even the veteran Hollywood and British Actors and Actresses are well remembered by all sections of our people. Our western film fans have fond memories of English/American movies even now.
I wish to also talk about a scenario where our SAARC member country Pakistan took advantage of its geographical location to receive economic aid internationally. In 2001 Pakistan made use of its proximity to Afghanistan to get a huge foreign debt waiver benefit from the mighty United States of America as the Americans wanted a good relationship with Pakistan.
In December 2001, the “Paris club” did this by cutting Pakistan’s foreign debt by us$12 billion. IMF also provided additional funding to Pakistan. As a result, the Pakistani currency strengthened. Foreign direct investments started pouring to Pakistan, with a good part of it ending in financial markets.
General Musharaf cleverly exploited the global security requirements to the advantage of his country he was ruling from 1998.This situation prevailed upto his ouster by other political parties. We never got this type of foreign debt waivers even after being engaged in a bloody war for nearly three decades. We must immediately prevail upon china to reduce interest rates on our loans taken prior to 2015 at this crucial juncture of our economy.
Our politicians talked about reducing the interest rate on Chinese loans to 1.4% per annum on a formula based on LIBOR on political platforms. China will have to accede to this if the formula is correct. We got into this adverse foreign currency reserve situation due to both china and India as we continuously ran high trade deficits as both countries did not open their markets to Sri Lankan produce. Indo Lanka Preferential Trade Agreement is now over 15 years old and no meaningful steps have been taken to redress the balance in Sri Lanka’s favour. Same applies to china and they have been charging commercial loan interest on their loans to our development projects with low repayment periods although as a country china is sitting on a mountain of foreign reserves.
They are only interested in expanding the so called silk route to their trade and defence requirements. Both China and India will have to show their true friendship and affection to the prosperity and economic progress of our country and its people. China played the cards closer to their chests firstly by assisting us to finish the north east war militarily. Then Sri Lanka had problems with procuring aid and foreign direct investments from the western countries as they were citing human rights violations on a broader basis and reconciliation among communities.
India wanted a solution to the North and East problem due to political pressures. We had to seek the assistance of China in a big way. It is true that we have had more tourist arrivals from china and India.
However, much more is to be done by these two countries in reducing the yawning trade gaps. We must start developing solid relationships with economically stable neutral countries so that as a country Sri Lanka would be a much safer country and stable in all avenues.
I sincerely hope that Sri Lanka will achieve solid economic growth and augmentation of its foreign reserves in the New Year dawned forgetting all their political ideologies and differences.
