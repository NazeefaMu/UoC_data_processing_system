Colouring Their Future

Kiddies and Toys International (KTI), with a view of providing families with access to the very latest premium childcare products at affordable prices, has ventured into the stationary business with the introduction of Faber-Castell products in Sri Lanka. KTI has signed an exclusive distribution agreement with Faber-Castell India, a subsidiary of Faber-Castell Germany.
KTI will introduce the writing and colouring range from India focused on school children. These will be writing pencils, wax and plastic crayons, fibre-tip colour markers, geometry boxes from the Faber-Castell range. The next phase will involve increasing the width of the range by adding products from the early age range and pastel. These are modelling doughs & clay, oil pastels, early age crayons and others.
Through this association with Faber-Castell KTI assures that all users of stationery will have access to the high quality sought-after international premium stationary products from the Faber-Castell range. These products will be made available through KTI’s island-wide network of stores and partner merchants.
Commenting on this new venture Yohan Ziard, CEO of KTI said, “Faber-Castell is a prestigious brand with an impressive history. We are proud to be able to provide the children of Sri Lanka with access to these high quality products that will bring greater joy to their pursuit of knowledge.
Our vision is to form long term partnerships like this that will eventually move the production of these much beloved products to Sri Lanka. This fits in with our commitment to providing safe, quality products that enrich the lives of children.”
