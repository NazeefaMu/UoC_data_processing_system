Sampath Bank’s ‘Wewata Jeewayak’  program gives life to dilapidated tanks

Sampath Bank recently handed over the renovated Ambagaha Wewa in Anuradhapura District’s Kahatagasdigiliya and Dhanyawa Wewain Polonnaruwa District’s Divulankadawala, Medirigiriya to members of the local communities.
Thusitha Nakandala, Deputy General Manager Branch Banking, Sampath Bank PLC presided over the ceremonial handing over of the tanks on October 30, along with government officials, members of the local farmers’ associations, other representatives from Sampath Bank and members of the respective villages.
The renovated Ambagaha Wewa and the Dhanyawa Wewa will serve as a rich source of water for the over 170 farming families cultivating paddy on about 152 acres of land across the two districts where the farming is largely dependent on functioning irrigation systems.
Spearheading such a comprehensive sustainable development project, Sampath Bankhad adopted a tripartite approach in association with the Irrigation Engineer’s Office of Minneriya, the Department of Agrarian Development of Anuradhapura and the members of the communityto renovate the two tanks under the ‘Wewata Jeewayak’ initiative, its flagship CSR program.
Commenting on the initiative, Lalith Weragoda, Assistant General Manager Human Resources, Sampath Bank PLC, said, “Proper and functioning irrigation systems remain the backbone of sustainable agricultural development in Anuradhapura and Polonnaruwa districts. Historically, Sri Lanka was well known for its sophisticated irrigation systems and technical know-how. Hailing from that proud tradition, farmers in Anuradhapura and Polonnaruwa can still rely on the tank systems to source water all year around to cultivate paddy.”
Following the official handing over of the renovated tanks, the two local Farmers’ Associations Sakvithi Farmers Association, Ambagaha Wewa and Divulkadawala Bedumela Farmers Association will assume the responsibility of maintaining and preserving the tanks under the guidance of Sampath Bank, the Department of Agrarian Development, Anuradhapura and the Irrigation Engineer’s Office, Minneriya. Having undertaken several similar projects in the past under the ‘WewataJeewayak’ initiative, Sampath Bank will be monitoring the progress of these two projects while continuing to support many more in the years to come.
Sampath Bank seeks to provide a viable solution to the catastrophic water shortage that the country’s dry zone has been experiencing through the ‘Wewata Jeewayak’ programme by restoring damages to tanks caused by improper maintenance. Providing farmers in the area with access to a year-round supply of water to cultivate paddy during both the ‘Yala’ and ‘Maha’ seasons, the Bank hopes to minimize the hardships theyface due to insufficient harvests.
Contributing to economic stability of the communities, the ‘Wewata Jeewayak’ programme helps safeguard the livelihood of agrarian entrepreneurs and their future generations by supporting the rise of more advanced and economically viableagro-based industries. It also plays a significant role in protecting the neighbouring eco-systems, preserving their bio-diversity and delivering longstanding benefits.
