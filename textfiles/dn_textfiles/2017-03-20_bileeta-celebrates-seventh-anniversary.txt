Bileeta celebrates  seventh anniversary

Bileeta, a company with an award-winning Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) solution, celebrates its 7th year.
Bileeta was started with the intention of offering a world-class product and CEO Sanji De Silva says the company was launched with ERP 6.0. Then, as technology was evolving rapidly and moving to Cloud and Mobiles, Bileeta capitalized on this trend and pioneered in developing a Cloud-based ERP solution called Entution, which is a comprehensive ERP solution based on a brand new concept called ‘Journeys.
“The uniqueness of this solution is that it is designed to simplify the user experience to any customer compared to traditional ERP solutions,” said De Silva. “Among the many advantages of Entution is the easy facilitation of overall business transactions, accuracy, visibility, minimizing human errors, staff efficiency, reduction of operational costs.
An added advantage is the affordability as the customers will not have to buy licenses or any hardware but instead can use the software on a subscription basis.”
During the seven-year journey, the company has won numerous awards, both locally and internationally. In 2014 Bileeta was recognised as the Overall Winner with a Gold award at NBQSA for Entution.
An award at the Asia Pacific Entrepreneurship Awards brought international fame which has now given the company leverage to take the product overseas. In the same year, CTO, Sanka Weerasinghe, was awarded the People’s Leader in IT award for his contribution towards people management practices.
“As a truly Sri Lankan company, we are proud of our achievements and our successes in digitally transforming small, medium and large companies, including those in the government and private sector,” said Sanka Weerasinghe.
According to Weerasinghe, one of the key factors of the company’s success is the employees. “We recruit our staff through a comprehensive testing procedure.
We encourage and nurture these employees through continous on-the-job training, knowledge transfer and appraisals.”
Envisaging on future plans, De Silva emphasizes that with the success of their Cloud-based ERP in the local market and having gained international recognition, his team is in the process of exploring overseas markets.
“During the last year, we had rapid growth of local client base and we are excited to be pitching our product to others. Year on year we double our clients which means the demand is high and that encourages us to enhance the product further,” he said.
