Free term test papers for NWP students

The North Western Provincial Education Ministry will provide term test papers to students of the provincial schools free of charge since this year.
About 300,000 students of 1,256 schools in the province will benefit. Provincial Education Minister Sandyakumar Rajapakse said this step was taken to relieve parents of the burden of paying for question papers while targeting a quality education for students.
