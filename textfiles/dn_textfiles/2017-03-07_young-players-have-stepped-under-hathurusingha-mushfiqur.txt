Young players have stepped up under Hathurusingha - Mushfiqur

GALLE: Galle holds special memories for Bangladesh captain Mushfiqur Rahim for it is at this venue four years ago when his team last toured Sri Lanka that he made his highest Test score - a brilliant double century. That marathon effort enabled Bangladesh to record their highest total in Test cricket – 638.
“It is always a nice feeling to have achieved something as an individual and team,” said Mushfiqur. “But it is a new game, and it looks like a new Sri Lanka attack apart from Rangana [Herath]. We have to play our best cricket to compete with them. It is very important to start well as a team.”
Mushfiqur said playing in Sri Lanka is a big challenge.
“They are playing in their home conditions and they recently defeated Australia. We would never take them lightly, as they are lions. But this time we have the chance to grab some good results for us. All the boys are keen and excited,” Mushfiqur said.
Bangladesh has yet to beat Sri Lanka in 16 Tests – losing 14 and drawing two.
Comparing the Galle pitch on which he made his highest Test score and the one being prepared for today’s Test, Mushfiqur said, “It is probably a bit different than the 2013 Test wicket. It is still a nice wicket to bat on, although I think there will be something for the quicks in the first two days. The wind might also help them with movement. As the days progress, spin will also come into play.”
Mushfiqur will not be keeping wickets in this series; his place going to 22-year-old Liton Das who many believe is a better wicket-keeper.
“It is a decision from the management. Sometimes it can do well for you, sometimes it doesn’t. The heat here is such that it doesn’t matter if you’re keeping or fielding. It is a tough job,” said Mushfiqur.
“I have said it repeatedly that my keeping helped me understand the wicket better, which helped me as a batsman. It will be a different feeling. I have to do what I am told to do, for the team. I am happy, and I will try to contribute as much as possible as a top-order batsman. I have played as a batsman before. The difference of course is that I will be without the pad and gloves.”
The 29-year-old wicket-keeper batsman is one of the few cricketers who played in the pre and post Chandika Hathurusingha era and he spoke of the changes that he has brought to the team.
“Five years ago, two or three guys were performing well, but now there are five or six guys. The young players have stepped up, like Mehedi and Mustafizur. They have strengthened our side. It is the beauty of our team. It is a good sign for Bangladesh cricket. In the near future we will have more players to put their hands up,” said Mushfiqur. - ST
