Govt prepared to give powers to SF to suppress public protests against govt.

Western Provincial Councillor Jagath Kumarayesterday, said the Government was prepared to provide powers to Field Marshal Sarath Fonseka and a military junta to suppress public protests against the government.
He said the people are ready to join hands against the oppression unleashed by the government.
Jagath Kumara said the government is in the practice of imposing taxes on people, while selling out the country’s assets to foreign countries for a song.
“Thousands of people around the country are waiting to take part in the Joint Opposition May Day rally to be held at Galle Face on Monday,” he said.
He said the only place where the average citizen could air his grievances and woes is at the Joint Opposition rally at Galle Face.
