Expressway  development  will lead to  large-scale  economic growth

Nihal Sooriyarachchi has been Chairman of the Road Development Authority for 13 months, and he is overseeing the ongoing Central Expressway project. While some claim that the project is taking too long and becoming too expensive, Sooriyarachchi argued that the highway is progressing on schedule in a cost-effective manner. He is also confident that continued expressway development will lead to large-scale economic growth for Sri Lanka while also relieving traffic in major metropolitan areas.
Excerpts follow:
Q: What is the progress on the Central Expressway project going? How far has it proceeded?
A: The Central Expressway project is going on in four phases. Section one runs from Kadawatha to Mirigama, section two is from Mirigama to Kurunegala. Section three splits off midway from section two, and goes from Pothuhara, which is before Kurunegala, towards Kandy and to Galagedara, a few kilometers away from Kandy town. And then section four is from Kurunegala to Dambulla. We are currently doing feasibility studies on the stretch from Galagedara to Kandy because it is a very mountainous area. There will be a lot of tunnels. We are looking at the economic as well as the technical feasibility of this stretch. When we do this road, we think that it will decrease the traffic congestion in Kandy, which is currently very bad. Too many vehicles currently have to pass through Kandy town, but when the expressway is done, there will be alternate routes available.

Q: Who is building the section with the tunnels?
A: Section three is earmarked for Japanese companies, because the terrain is very difficult to manage. There will be long tunnels and high viaducts.
Q: Why is the project split into four parts?
A: We have divided this into affordable sizes so that we could complete the project between two and half and three years. If this is given to one whole contractor, it would be a huge contract sum and a massive project. To avoid that, and to complete the project in a timely manner, we had to split it up.
Q: And how is the central expressway project being financed?
A: We have signed an agreement with the Chinese EXIM Bank for section one, and this stretch will be built by the MCC, the Metallurgical Corporation of China. We have given section two to our own contractors, which will be the first time in Sri Lanka's history that local contractors build a highway here. We have divided that portion of about 40 kilometers into four sections, and we have had expressions of interest from local contractors who are capable of building the highway and who are doing the subcontracting for foreign companies. We along with the relevant ministers, the Prime Minister, as well as other government officials thought that we should assess the capabilities of local contractors so that they can go out and do other projects. We have also selected a local consultancy firm. We identified the capable consulting firms in Sri Lanka, and we have followed the proposals to amalgamate these Sri Lankan companies and form a joint venture consortium. The financial arrangements for section two are currently being drawn up, but local banks will finance it. With regard to section four, we are evaluating a proposal from a Chinese contractor with the assistance of Chinese EXIM Bank. Those are on a proposal basis now. And the Kandy leg will be handled by the Japanese Mitsubishi Company. We are still evaluating the proposals made by Japanese contractors.
Q: What are the main challenges of building this highway?
A: Funding is always a challenge with these large projects. Then figuring out how to maximise the use of resources is important. We also have to be mindful of the social impacts of highway construction. We have done Environmental Impact Assessments (EIA) for sections one, two, and four which have come back very positive. They are approved. For the third section, we have come to the final stages, and we might get the approval today or tomorrow. That is for section three. Arranging the soil extraction and removal sites was very difficult, but we have managed so far. Land acquisition, not only with respect to the Central Expressway, is complicated and ongoing. We have to deal with human thinking and human lives, because many have ancestral properties that they do not want to give up. So, that is a challenge.

Q: Have you figured out how to minimise the environmental impact of this project?
A: We are building in some flood-prone areas, and we are using viaducts to minimise the impacts of our digging. We have avoided embankment filling in flood-prone areas. In this development we have no choice but to disturb the environment.
When building the Southern Expressway, we had to disturb the Dandeniya Aparekka Forest Reserve. We promised to plant 100 trees for every single tree we removed to make up for cutting some of the forest. That was a mandate given to us, and we agreed and have taken action to do that. We want to do the same thing with the Central Expressway.
Q: Please explain the mechanism for land acquisition.
A: We are going under the Special Provisions made under the Land Acquisition Act. When we identified the route and mapped out the ROW (right of way) measurements, then we marked the route on the ground and identified the blocks which would be affected by construction. Then, with the help of surveyors, we surveyed and got the details of the acquisition that needed to be done. People make objections to the land acquisition procedures, but most people, between 90 and 95 percent, are satisfied with the compensation package we are offering. The Lands Director is finally responsible for the acquisition.
Q: Can you tell me about the maintenance and tolls? What will that money be used for?
A: During the operations, we keep some toll money to pay salaries and for future maintenance.
Q: Are the rumours that costs keep going up true?
A: We have done a lot of analysis on this question. Now, people say that costs have risen per kilometer. But that is not the way to assess cost increases. What we have done is we have identified the major construction items we will be using, concrete and steel, things like that. And we have to compare the cost of those individual items. One can say that from A to B, the cost was this much per kilometer. But recently, even with respect to the Central Expressway, we had to raise route heights due to the recent flood in 2015. In some places, it was raised by as much as four meters. The average increase was 1.5 meters. Now, for that, if you want pillars to support the roadway, you have to increase the height of the pillars. If you want to increase the height on embankments, you have to enhance the quantity of filling. The best and most sensible comparison will look at the rates from that period and this period for the newer, safer plans. The higher pillars and embankments would have been more expensive a year or two ago. When we compare it this way, costs have decreased by about 30 percent. But we have to apportion about 8 percent decrease to the fall of costs on the world market. But, if you want to say that costs have increased per kilometer, you can say that. But it is not the best way to measure projects like this.

Q: Can you discuss the long-term overall highway and expressway plan in the country?
A: Yes. We have to build highways to Jaffna, Trincomalee, and to Batticaloa via Polonnaruwa, which will all branch off from the Central Expressway. We are just building the first stage of the Central Expressway now, but it will be extended. We have four phases so far, but the fifth will be to Jaffna via Anuradhapura, the sixth is to Trincomalee, and the seventh is towards Batticaloa via Polonnaruwa. Then we have identified a road called Ruwanpura Expressway, which will stretch from the Kahatuduwa exit on the Southern Expressway to Ratnapura via Ingiriya. Then it will go from Ratnapura to Palmadulla. This project has not yet started, but we have done the design and marked the road. We are taking action to do acquisition for the first leg up to Ingiriya. We have expressed that we want to build an expressway towards Uva, to Badulla, and we are doing feasibility studies to determine whether to extend the Ratnapura highway to that area or to extend the Southern Expressway. Currently, that road is in operation up to Matara, but we want to extend it to Hambantota. Work is progressing on this section, though there were delays due to land acquisition. But we are sure that we can start work by mid-2019 up to Hambantota, and that extension would go to Mattala airport and the harbour. If the government plans to develop Hambantota, we need a workforce, and the best workforce available for that area is from Uva. We are doing the feasibility of extending the Southern Expressway to Badulla, and we are doing a comparison between doing that and or extending the Ruwanpura Expressway. I think it is more likely that we extend from the Southern Expressway because of the need for a workforce.

Q: Are there plans to connect the Southern Expressway to the Colombo-Katunayake Expressway?
A: Yes, it is being done. We call this the Outer Circular Highway. There are only about nine kilometers to be done, and it has started with Chinese EXIM Bank funding. It has to be completed by 2019. 2019 is a big year for us, and we need to get public support for our projects. We had a meeting yesterday with our Minister Lakshman Kiriella, who is giving us a lot of support. When we are stuck, he intervenes on our behalf, as are the Prime Minister and the Finance Minister. All are supporting us because they know that big infrastructure development is crucial. And we are encouraging business leaders to position their industries near the exits of our highways because that will allow them to benefit. We are looking to have industrial parks near the expressway exits. We hope that we can meet the many challenges we are facing.
