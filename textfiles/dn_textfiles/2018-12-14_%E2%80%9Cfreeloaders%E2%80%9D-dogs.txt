“Freeloaders” in dogs

Parasites are “freeloaders” that live in or on another creature. Common parasites in dogs are ticks, lice and fleas.
Fleas
Fleas are small dark brown insects prefer temperatures of 65-80 degrees and humidity levels of 75-85 percent and found on dogs more likely to be a problem during warm-weather months. Generally, unlike the burrowing, microscopic Demodex or Scabies Mites, fleas of about the size of the head of a pin can be seen scurrying along the surface of the skin.
Understanding the Flea Life Cycle
There are several stages to its life cycle: egg, larva or caterpillar, pupa or cocoon, and adult. The length of time it takes to complete this cycle varies depending upon the environmental conditions such as temperature, humidity, and the availability of a nourishing host. The adult female flea typically lives for several weeks on the pet, suck the animal’s blood two to three times and then lay twenty to thirty eggs each day. These eggs fall off of the pet into the yard, bedding, carpet, and wherever else the animal spends time. The egg then hatches into larvae. These tiny worm-like larvae live among the carpet fibers, in cracks of the floor, and outside in the environment. They feed on organic matter, skin scales, and even the blood-rich adult flea feces. The larvae grow, molt twice and then form a cocoon and pupate, waiting for the right time to hatch into an adult. They can survive quite a long time, waiting until environmental conditions and host availability are just right. The newly emerged adult flea can jump onto a nearby host immediately. The entire life cycle is just fourteen days.
Signs
The dog repeatedly scratches and chews the skin and when you observe you may actually see tiny brown fleas moving quickly through your dog’s hair coat. Constant scratching may lead to visible patches of hair loss and reddened, irritated skin. Fleas may also cause skin allergies and can transmit other parasites, such as tapeworms, to your dog. Fleas dislike light so looking for them within furry areas, groin, armpits and base of the tail, belly and inner thighs will provide your best chances of spotting them.
Flea developing areas
The fleas may reproduce in Carpets, pet bedding, furniture, and other indoor areas where your dog spends much time. Fleas also develop in shady, protected outdoor areas where your dog likes to rest and relax.
Spread
Dogs and cats often get infested with fleas through contact with other animals or contact with fleas in the environment. The strong back legs of this insect enable it to jump from host to host or from the environment onto the host.
Diagnosis - “Flea test” at home
You can look for "flea dirt". "Flea dirt" looks like dark specks of pepper scattered on the skin surface. If you see flea dirt, which is actually flea feces and is composed of digested blood, pick some off the pet and place on a wet paper towel. If after a few minutes the tiny specks spread out like a small blood stain, it's definitely flea dirt and your pet has fleas!
Lice
Lice are species-specific; those that thrive on human blood won’t change their dining preferences if they land on a dog, or vice versa. Dog lice are small, flat, wingless six-legged insects that live in the hair. They survive on skin debris, sebaceous secretions, feathers, or the blood of the host animal. Adult lice are large enough to be visible to the naked eye, roughly the size of a sesame seed—about 3 millimeters—and are yellow to tan in color. They are sometimes mistaken for dandruff. Lice have limited mobility; they can crawl, but are unable to jump, hop, or fly. Lice are found mostly on animals that are old, sick, stray, or feral
Life cycle
There are several stages in the life cycle such as egg, nymph and adult. The cycle starts when the female lays tiny yellow or white eggs at the base of the hair shaft. These eggs are glued to the hair. It takes about a week for the eggs to hatch, releasing the immature lice, known as “nymphs,” which are no larger than the head of a pin. After about a week, they enter the adult phase, starting the cycle all over again. The entire life is about 30 days.
Signs
There may be itching, pain, inflammation, rough, dry, or matted coat, hair loss specifically around ears, neck, shoulders, groin, and rectal regions, small wounds or infections from bites by sucking lice, anemia in extreme cases or in small dogs and puppies, scratching, rubbing and/or biting at skin, restlessness, skin redness, irritation, lethargy, weight loss, poor development in severely infested pups
Spread
Lice spread through direct contact. Locations where dogs are in close contact such as dog parks, boarding kennels, grooming facilities and animal shelters are all possible places pets can contract lice.
Treatment, prevention and control of external parasites
Two methods of manual and chemical control are widely effective to control external parasites all over the world.
1. Frequent vacuuming dog sitting areas and frequent washing of your dog’s bedding can greatly reduce the number of developing parasites inside your home.
2. Both indoor and outdoor areas can be sprayed with insecticides to eliminate parasite. Insecticide treatments will kill one stage of the life cycle, so will have to be repeated at regular intervals for a month or more.
3. Giving your dog extra omega-3 fatty acid supplements with the diet will help to improve skin health.
4. Using a comb (a comb made with very close-set teeth) will physically pull parasites from the dog’s body.
5. Pills and other spot-on chemical treatments have proven to be some of the fastest ways to rid your pet of parasite. Tablets works within 30-minutes and kills 90 per cent of all parasites within four hours. Spot-on treatments tend to take a few days to work, and some only target eggs while other target adults, so it's important to buy the right one.
6. Wearing a collar containing medicine also an effective method.
7. There are several shampoos for dogs in the market that are quite effective. Your pet can stand being soaking wet and lathered up for ten minutes and use a comb to remove the parasite from your dog.
8. All dogs in the household whether they are not affected should be treated.
9. Pets require supplementation with iron, vitamins and minerals to address anemia
