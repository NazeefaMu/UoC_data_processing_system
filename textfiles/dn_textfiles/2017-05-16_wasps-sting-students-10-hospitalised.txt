Wasps sting students, 10 hospitalised

A section of Sri Naga National School,Naula housing Advanced Level students, descended into a ‘war zone’ after a wasp nest unleashed its fury on the group of students.
Students of the rest of the school were disturbed prompting the administration to close the school to ensure safety of children.
A large number of children had been stung and at least 10 students were hospitalised.
The wasp nest which was disturbed had been built in the ceiling of one of the Advanced Level classrooms.
