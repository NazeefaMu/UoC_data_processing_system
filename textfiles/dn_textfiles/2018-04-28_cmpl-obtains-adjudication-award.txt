CMPL obtains Adjudication Award

The Construction Managers and Planners (Pvt.) Limited (CMPL) obtained an Adjudication Award of Rs. 74 mn against the developer, Regent Residencies Apartment Complex in Mount Lavinia, Regent Property Developers Lanka (Pvt.) Limited (Regent) recently.
The Award confirms that Regent owes the amount to the CMP as unpaid dues for the construction of the Regent Residencies Apartment Complex in Mount Lavinia.
The Commercial High Court has also issued an enjoining order against Regent Property Developers Lanka (Pvt.) Limited preventing them from transferring apartments held in their name and any further sale of apartments in Regent Residencies Apartment Complex in Mount Lavinia.
The CMPL, in the case bearing no. CHC 205/2018/MR, obtained an enjoining from the Commercial High Court preventing Regent from alienating and/or transferring and/or selling and/or otherwise disposing of any further apartments situated at No. 71 & 71/1, Watarappola Road, Mount Lavinia including the all apartments that are currently held in the name of Regent.
The CMPL alleges that Regent, on the basis of an advertisement published in a newspaper, is offering for sale with an intention to fritter away its asset to avoid the recovery of money owed to them in terms of the Adjudication award.
