Arrested with fake conductors’ licences

The Panadura Division Crime Unit has arrested an employee of the Western Province Road Transport Divison Panadura Private Bus Depot while preparing fake conductors’ licences at Panadura Gunatilleke Mawatha on Sunday.
Police seized six forged conductors’ licences of Panadura Private coaches. The suspect was produced before the Panadura Chief Magistrate's Court and remanded pending further investigations. Meanwhile, most private bus conductors do not possess conductors’ licences in the Kalutara District. Police believe that some Army deserters have been employed as private bus conductors.
