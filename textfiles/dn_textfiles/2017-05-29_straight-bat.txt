With a straight bat

He had the reputation of being an opener. Later he anchored his place as a middle order batsman in the Sri Lankan cricket national team. His record of 212 not out together with Kumar Sangakkara against England in 2015 remains the highest second wicket partnership for Sri Lanka in ODI cricket. He is also the former ODI captain of the team. Lahiru Thirimanne has often been described as a player with unflappable talent and determination. His dainty and bubbly wife Rukshani Thirimanna née Harishchandra tells us what the man behind the bat is like.
First meeting
Ours is a love marriage. We met during our G C E Advanced Level Classes. I am from Princess of Wales’ College, Moratuwa, and Lahiru schooled at Prince of Wales’ College, Moratuwa. So, even our schools were close by. We both joined the same Chemistry class. I did not take notice of him much because he didn’t speak to anyone. I only began to notice him when he got my phone number through one of his friends and called me. Till then I did not have the slightest idea that he was interested in me! I have always imagined him as the ‘egocentric character’ in the group. However after we started talking I realized that his reserved qualities appealed to me a lot. There is much more to him than that which meets the eye. We celebrate nine years of togetherness this year. We got married in December 2014.
Second thoughts

Lahiru has played cricket in school for his school team. So it did not come as a surprise that he was selected for the national team because he showed signs of becoming a world class player. I was ok with him making a career out of it because it was something he is passionate about. However I was definitely a bit scared because that means that he would have to travel a lot and not be in the country much. However, after the first few months I got used to it. So I do not oppose if he wants to continue playing for the team for many more years.
The husband
He has been as loving towards me as he was before marriage. Before marriage he was more carefree and light hearted. Then after marriage he became more ‘responsible’. That was the only change that I saw in Lahiru – the husband- from Lahiru – the boyfriend. We got to know that I was expecting while I was accompanying him on one of his tours in England. He was elated with the news. He started taking me to the temple more often.
The ‘New Dad’
Lahiru takes his duties much more seriously now that there is a third member in our family. Our son, Livaan Rashnuka, is three months old. He has become a doting father to him. Though we were not specific about it, we both secretly wanted a son. Now that he is here we have not made plans to get him into cricket or any other profession. It is up to him to decide what he wants to engage in as he grows up. However I have noticed that he has taken a special interest towards cricket whenever it is being played on TV. He would just stare at the screen wide eyed and would not bat an eye easily. So who know? Must be the genes!
An alternative profession
If he had not made it to the international team and become a globally renowned cricketer Lahiru would have become a successful engineer. He is interested in the subject. He had done Maths for his G C E Advanced Levels, studying subjects like Physics and Chemistry. So he could have gotten into that field easily. He is currently pursuing studies in management.
Holidaying together
We mostly spend any free time we have at home but if we get an extended holiday we like to go down south.
Foodwise
Since he is in the national cricket team Lahiru has to follow a specific diet. However, whenever he is allowed to have a ‘cheat meal’ he likes to indulge in the prawn curry that I make. We are both fans of the Sri Lankan cuisine so even if we are dining out we mostly crave for Sri Lankan dishes.
Temperwise
Lahiru does get angry – especially if he is faced with unfair circumstances. Such things really get to him. We have had our share of disagreements but the good thing about him is that he cools off after a while and does not keep the anger within his system at length. We keep away from each other’s company for a while after an argument. Then when both parties have had time to cool down we seek each other and discuss the problem and find a solution.
Three lesser known facts
Lahiru may seem snobbish but that is just the way he seems to others. So do not judge the book by its cover. He is very is very honest and faithful. You have to become close to him to get to know these characteristics. If someone wins his heart he would never let go of that person. He would become a lifelong friend to him or her.
In brief
If I was asked to sum Lahiru up in one word I would choose ‘goodwilled’. He does not get close to people easily. Therefore many mistake him for a snob. However if they can really get to know him they would realize that he has a heart of gold and can be a very loyal and caring companion throughout their alliance.
Ten years from today
If he chooses to stay in the cricket field I believe that Lahiru would become one of the best batsmen in the world. If he wishes to begin his own business I think he would succeed in that sector. Lahiru’s father had passed away when he was 10 years old. So there has been a lot of people who have helped him to reach the position that he is in today. We are grateful to our parents, his father’s brother Viraj Thirimanne, his brother Thulindu, his coaches and anyone who has helped him out even by saying an encouraging word.
