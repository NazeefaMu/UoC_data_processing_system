Keaton Jennings hits century for Lancashire at Trent Bridge

LONDON, Saturday: Keaton Jennings’ second successive century and a fine performance from Lancashire's seamers put them on the verge of beating County Championship leaders Nottinghamshire at Trent Bridge on Saturday.
Jennings was bowled by Stuart Broad (4-41) for 126 as the Red Rose county moved from 157-4 to 338 all out.
Facing a deficit of 205, Notts’ second innings saw Steven Mullaney, Chris Nash and Ross Taylor all out for nought.
Notts recovered slightly from 1-3 to reach stumps on 106-5, trailing by 99.
Earlier, opener Jennings followed up his 109 against Somerset with his 16th first-class century off 214 deliveries to strengthen his chances of adding to his six England Test caps. The squad for the first Test against Pakistan will be announced on Tuesday.
England hopeful Joe Clarke scored his second County Championship century in a row for Worcestershire, before Alastair Cook led Essex's fightback at New Road.
Clarke's brilliant 105 was compiled as wickets tumbled around him - the hosts collapsing from 142-2 to 238 all out. The 21-year-old was eventually out lbw to Ravi Bopara (3-30), having helped the Pears to a lead of 61.
Essex moved to 143-4 at the close of play, to lead by 82 with England opener Cook making 66.
James Hildreth hit his second century of the summer to help bat Somerset into a commanding position on day two of their Division One game with Hampshire.
Somerset soon picked up the two wickets they needed as Hampshire were bowled out for 231 at Taunton. Gareth Berg (4-88) helped reduce Somerset to 134-5 in reply.
But Hildreth, who finished unbeaten on 125, put on 133 for the sixth wicket with England's Craig Overton (80) to help his side reach 324-7 at the close. Hildreth, 33, who struck 15 fours, has now scored 322 Championship runs this summer at an average of 64.4.
Surrey and Yorkshire were left frustrated by the weather on day two of their County Championship match as rain washed out the final two sessions.
Ollie Pope added 27 to his overnight score to finish on a career-best 158 not out, and helped Surrey to claim maximum batting bonus points before they were out for 414. Yorkshire were wobbling on 40-3 when rain arrived just before lunch.
Derbyshire's bowlers were given a decent platform by their batsmen to try to force a win after the second day of their Division Two clash with Durham.
Resuming on 301-4, Wayne Madsen (85) could only add five to his overnight score, but Matt Critchley's 64 from 85 balls helped Derbyshire to 427 all out. Hardus Viljoen took two wickets in three balls as Durham slipped to 51-2. But an unbeaten stand of 64 from Graham Clark and Cameron Steel steadied the innings before bad light ended play. Leicestershire fought back strongly as they reached 119-2 in their second innings, 132 runs ahead of Glamorgan.
Glamorgan crashed from 82-0 overnight to 178 all out, Indian paceman Varun Aaron claiming 4-65 in his best Leicester display.
Ben Raine, Gavin Griffiths and Neil Dexter shared the other wickets, though the visitors were not helped by some careless shots.
Paul Horton then hit an aggressive 50, but heavy rain ended play.
A Michael Burgess-inspired fightback saw Sussex remain in contention in their Division Two game with Kent.
Resuming on 69-4, Burgess hit 54 from 70 balls and was last man out as Sussex were dismissed for 181, Matt Henry finishing with 4-69.
Ishant Sharma removed both of Kent's openers as they limped to 31-2 before Heino Kuhn (47) and Joe Denly (26) brought some control to the innings. Kent finally reached the close on 125-4, a lead of 159.
Only 26 overs were possible because of rain on day two of the County Championship match between Middlesex and Gloucestershire at Lord's. Middlesex moved from their overnight 356-6 to 455-8 declared.
Olly Stone took three wickets to bowl Division Two leaders Warwickshire into a potentially match-winning position against former club Northamptonshire.
Tim Ambrose hit 78 in a ninth-wicket stand of 95 with Henry Brookes (50) as the Bears were dismissed for 265 to earn a slender first-innings lead. Northants then stumbled to the 160-7, a lead of 151, when bad light intervened.
