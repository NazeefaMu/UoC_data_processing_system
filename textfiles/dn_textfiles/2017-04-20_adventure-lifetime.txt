Q: What made you enter the world of sports?
A:Well my father was a very sporty character back in the day. So all he used to talk about with me or his friends were, sports or the things that happened back then, when they played. So I think that was something that influenced me to have an interest in the sporting world.
Q:Who has supported you the most?
A:I cannot name one person as such. But my parents played a major role in supporting me. Then come my coaches (Senaka, Udayasiri, Sanath Martis, Colin Denish, Angelo Wickramaratne). And my fellow team mates Kevin Dixon, Nishon Perera, Rahal Delpachithra, Avishka Heenpella and Sandesh Jayawickrema have been very supportive and influential.
