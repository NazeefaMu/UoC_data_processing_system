Councillor opposes hydro electricity project

Extensive damage could be caused to the environment if the proposed 16 small-scale hydro electricity schemes based on small water bodies in the Dehiowita Pradeshiya Sabha area are given the go ahead, said JVP member Kosala Nuwan Jayaweera.
“As such, the Dehiowita Pradeshiya Sabha should object to this proposal,” he said.
JVP member Jayaweera was addressing the monthly meeting of the Dehiowita Pradeshiya Sabha, recently.
He said 16 varieties of fish and some frogs endemic to the area too would become extinct if these mini hydro electricity schemes were set up in the area.
Pradeshiya Sabha Chairman Dumindu Shyaminda said the council had not received any notification about setting up such mini hydro electricity schemes in the area. Even if the council was notified about such a proposal, it would be compelled to oppose it.
