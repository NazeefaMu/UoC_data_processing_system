Jinnah Scholarship awarded to Lankan students

The annual distribution ceremony for the Jinnah Scholarship, awarded by the government of Pakistan through its High Commission in Sri Lanka, to high-achieving local students for study in Pakistan, was held on Monday evening at the BMICH.
The scholarship, named for the founder of Pakistan, Muhammad Ali Jinnah, has been awarded to over 1,500 Sri Lankan students since its inception in 2006. This year, in conjunction with the University Grants Commission of Sri Lanka, the Pakistani High Commission awarded the scholarship to a record-setting 186 students.
In addition to the scholarships, prizes were also awarded during the ceremony to students who participated in a painting competition which the Pakistani High Commission held on the theme ‘Gandhara Civilization’.
The occasion was graced by the Pakistani High Commissioner to Sri Lanka, Dr. Shahid Ahmad Hashmat, as well as Chairman of the University Grants Commission of Sri Lanka Prof. Mohan De Silva and other members of academia in the country.
