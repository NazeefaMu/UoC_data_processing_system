Speak as per agenda – Ja-Ela UC Chairman

Ja-Ela Urban Council (UC) Chairman Shammika Dias (SLPP) said the members of the UC should speak as per the agenda.
He was addressing the UC monthly meeting held at its office on December 7.
JVP member Anton Priyashantha said the Chairman should know how to respect and address the members without acting like a joker. He said that all the work of the UC should be carried out following the State tender procedures.
UNP member Earnest Fernando said that when roads are repaired on estimates, the UC members in the respective areas should be informed as they have a right to know them, he said.
He said he was a former Chairman of the UC and he has ample experience of the UC work and no one should underestimate his calibre. He told the Chairman that he has no right to stop the members questioning as there could always be corruption in some projects.
Deputy Chairman Ruvinda Abeyratne (UNP) said that all road development work of the UC should be carried out as per the accepted tender procedure from the next year.
