Psychedelic jungle plant that gives a near-death experience

A traditional jungle plant can create a 'near-death experience' when consumed, research has found.
Ayahuasca, which natives in Central and South America drink in liquid form, is used to create the psychedelic drug known as Dimethyltryptamine (DMT). And while the drug is illegal in most countries, its link with spirituality is widely acknowledged.
The powerful hallucinogen is usually used for ceremonial purposes in South America and has earned the nickname "the spirit molecule."
A study has found a "large overlap" between the effects of the drug, and descriptions of so-called near death experiences (NDEs).
Researchers from Imperial College London provided 13 volunteers with DMT and they completed a questionnaire afterwards.
Their responses were compared to those of a sample of 67 people, who have previously had NDEs. Each of the groups reported visions of bright light and the feeling outside of the body. There was also an experience of travelling through a void, inner peace and a sense of transitioning to a new world. Similarities happen because the drug and NDEs trigger similar processes in the brain.
Dr Robin Carhart-Harris, lead author of the study in the journal Frontiers in Psychology, told the MailOnline that studying the effects of DMT would help scientists 'better understand the psychology and biology of dying'.
