Five men arrested with weapons, heroin

Warakapola Police arrested five persons who were allegedly on their way to commit a crime and seized weapons and some heroin from them at Ambepussa, Warakapola, the Police Media Spokesman said.
The group were travelling in a van when police arrested them on a tip-off.
The arrested were identified as Roshan Nawaratne (33) of Amparai, Gayan Chinthaka (32) of Galle, Deshapriya Kuruppu (44) of Angoda, Gunaratnejedige Karunatillake (62) of Borukgamuwa and Saman Kumara (50) of Bopitiya. Two local revolvers, 11 ammunition, 42 g and 790 mg of heroin, and two daggers were seized from the suspects along with the van.
The suspects had told police that they were on their way to rob a house.
They also revealed that they planned to abduct its owner and kill him. Gayan Chinthaka, the second suspect, is reportedly an army deserter involved in heroin trafficking.
A case against him is heard at the Galle Magistrate’s Court over a murder he committed on April 14, 2017. He allegedly had severely assaulted the victim’s brother.
The Police Spokesman said Saman Kumara, the fifth suspect, allegedly had stolen a motorcycle in 2009 in the Gampaha, Imbulgoda area, robbed a house in Thelikada the same year and stolen a van and committed several robberies in the Mount Lavinia area.
The five suspects were produced before the Thulhiriya Magistrate’s Court and detained under police custody for seven days. Warakapola Police are investigating.
