Lankan cleared of charges in 19-year-old rape case

A Sri Lankan national charged with raping a young South Korean woman nearly two decades ago was acquitted by the top court on Tuesday, in the final twist of a long-drawn-out investigation into the cold case.
The Supreme Court upheld the not-guilty rulings by the lower courts on the 51-year-old foreigner, whose identity has been withheld, citing a lack of evidence.
"It is difficult to believe the veracity of their testimonies in light of objectivity and details of the statements," the top court said in the ruling. The defendant was indicted in 2013 on charges of robbing and raping an 18-year-old college student, only identified by her last name Chung, in 1998. The belated indictment came as the DNA of the defendant, who was arrested for soliciting prostitution to a minor, was found to match that left on Chung's underwear.
Chung was found dead on Oct. 17, 1998, after being hit by a 25-ton dump truck on a highway in Daegu, some 302 kilometres south-east of Seoul. The police had suspected rape as they found her lingerie 30 meters away from the site of the accident, but concluded it was an accidental death.
In the fresh investigation, the prosecutors found that Chung jumped into the road as she ran away from her attackers in fear and had lost sense of direction in the dark.
The prosecutors indicted the Sri Lankan and two other accomplices of the same nationality on counts of special robbery and rape in 2013.
