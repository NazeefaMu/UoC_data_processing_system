Opening the door of wisdom

That the Bo tree sapling was brought to Sri Lanka from India by Arahant nun Sanghamitta is common knowledge. Jaya Sri Maha Bodhi, as famously known, is a sacred fig tree in Anuradhapura said to be a sapling from the historical Bodhi tree under which the Buddha achieved enlightenment. The sapling belongs to the southern branch of the original Bodhi tree in Bodh Gaya. Planted in 288 BC, the Bo tree is the most ancient human-planted tree with a traceable date. King Devanampiyatissa planted the sapling in Mahameghavana Park, Anuradhapura, in 249 BC.
The bo tree is planted on 6.5m (21.3ft) high terrace on the ground and is surrounded by railings. Much revered by the Buddhists both Sri Lankan and across the globe, the tree was surrounded by a wall built during King Kirthi Sri Rajasinghe’s period. It was a barrier for wild elephants.
Sanghamitta links two important personalities: Emperor Asoka being her father and Arahant Mahinda being her brother. Emperor Ashoka was hesitant a little at first to send his daughter on this overseas mission, yet finally gave in as the intention was bona fide. Arahant Sanghamitta was accompanied by a number of Buddhist nuns as a result of Sinhala royal ladies requested Buddhist nun order be set up in Sri Lanka.
Reproduced below is the Mahawamsa account on the arrival of the Bo Tree.
When the lord of chariots had appointed to watch over the Bodhi-tree eighteen persons from royal families and eight from families of ministers, and moreover eight persons from brahman families and eight from families of traders and persons from the cowherds likewise, and from the hyena and sparrowhawk-clans, (from each one man), and also from the weavers and potters and from all the handicrafts, from the nagas and the yakkhas; when then the most exalted prince had given them eight vessels of gold and eight of silver, and had brought the great Bodhi-tree to a ship on the Ganges, and likewise the theri Samghamitta with eleven bhikkhunis, and when he had caused those among whom Arittha was first to embark on that same ship, he fared forth from the city, and passing over the Viñjhä-mountains the prince arrived, in just one week, at Tamalitti.
The gods also and the nagas and men who were worshipping the great Bodhi-tree with the most splendid offerings, arrived in just one week. The ruler of the earth, who had caused the great Bodhi-tree to be placed on the shore of the great ocean, worshipped it once more by (bestowing upon it) the great kingship.
When the wish-fulfiller had consecrated the great Bodhi tree as a great monarch, he then, on the first day of the bright half of the month Maggasira, commanded that the same noble persons, eight of each (of the families) appointed at the foot of the great säla-tree to escort the great Bodhi-tree, should raise up the great Bodhi tree; and, descending there into the water till it reached his neck, he caused it to be set down in seemly wise on the ship. When he had brought the great theri with the (other) theris on to the ship he spoke these words to the chief minister Maharittha: ‘Three times have I worshipped the great Bodhi-tree by (bestowing) kingship (upon it). Even so shall the king my friend also worship it by (bestowing) kingship (upon it).’ When the great king had spoken thus he stood with folded hands on the shore, and as he gazed after the vanishing great Bodhi-tree he shed tears. ‘Sending forth a net like rays of sunshine the great Bodhi-tree of the (Buddha) gifted with the ten powers departs, alas! from hence!’
Filled with sorrow at parting from the great Bodhi-tree Dhammasoka returned weeping and lamenting to his capital. The ship, laden with the great Bodhi-tree, fared forth into the sea. A yojana around the waves of the great ocean were stilled. Lotus-flowers of the five colours blossomed all around and manifold instruments of music resounded in the air. By many devatas many offerings were provided, and the nagas practised their magic to win the great Bodhi-tree. The great theri Samghamitta, who had reached the last goal of supernormal powers, taking the form of a griffin terrified the great snakes. Terrified, the great snakes betook them to the great theri with entreaties, and when they had escorted the great Bodhi-tree from thence to the realm of the serpents and had worshipped it for a week by (bestowing on it) the kingship of the nagas and by manifold offerings they brought it again and set it upon the ship. And on that same day the great Bodhi-tree arrived here at Jambukola.
King Devanampiyatissa, thoughtful for the welfare of the world, having heard before from the samanera Sumana of its arrival, did, from the first day of the month Maggasira onwards, being always full of zeal, cause the whole of the highroad from the north gate even to Jambukola to be made ready, awaiting the arrival of the great Bodhi-tree, and abiding on the sea-shore, in the place where the Samuddapannasälä (afterwards) was, he, by the wondrous power of the theri, saw the great Bodhi-tree coming. The hall that was built upon that spot to make known this miracle was known here by the name Samuddapannasala.
By the power of the great thera and together with the (other) theras the king came, with his retinue, on that same day to Jambukola. Then, uttering an exulting cry moved by joyous agitation at the coming of the great Bodhi-tree, he, the splendid (king), descended even neck-deep into the water; and when together with sixteen persons (of noble families) he had taken the great Bodhi-tree upon his head, had lifted it down upon the shore and caused it to be set in a beautiful pavilion, the king of Lanka worshipped it by (bestowing on it) the kingship of Lanka. When he had then entrusted his own government to the sixteen persons and he himself had taken the duties of a doorkeeper, the lord of men forthwith commanded solemn ceremonies of many kinds to be carried out for three days. On the tenth day he placed the great Bodhi-tree upon a beautiful car and he, the king of men, accompanying this, the king of trees, he who had knowledge of the (right) places caused it to be placed on the spot where the Eastern Monastery (afterwards) was and commanded a morning meal for the people together with the brotherhood. Here the great thera Mahinda related fully to the king the subduing of the nägas which had been achieved by the (Buddha) gifted with the ten powers. When the monarch heard this from the thera he caused monuments to be raised here and there in such places as had been frequented by the Master by resting there or in other ways. And, moreover, when he had caused the great Bodhi-tree to be set down at the entrance to the village of the brahman Tivakka and in this and that place besides, he, (escorting it) on the road, sprinkled with white sand, bestrewn with various flowers, and adorned with planted pennons and festoons of blossoms, bringing thereto offerings unweariedly, day and night, brought the great Bodhi-tree on the fourteenth day to the neighbourhood of the city of Anurädhapura, and after, at the time when the shadows increase, he had entered the city worthily adorned by the north gate amid offerings, and (when he then), leaving the city again by the south gate, had entered the Mahämeghavanäräma consecrated by four Buddhas, and here had brought (the tree) to the spot worthily prepared by Sumana’s command, to the lovely place where the former Bodhi-trees had stood, he, with those sixteen noble persons, who were wearing royal ornaments, lifted down the great Bodhi-tree and loosed his hold to set it down.
Hardly had he let it leave his hands but it rose up eighty cubits into the air, and floating thus it sent forth glorious rays of six colours. Spreading over the island, reaching to the Brahma-world, these lovely rays lasted till sunset. Ten thousand persons, who were filled with faith by reason of this miracle, gaining the spiritual insight and attaining to arahantship, received here the pabbajja.
When the great Bodhi-tree at sunset was come down from (its place in the air) it stood firm on the earth under the constellation Rohini. Then did the earth quake. The roots growing over the brim of the vase struck down into the earth, closing in the vase. When the great Bodhi-tree had taken its place all the people who had come together from (the country) round, worshipped it with offerings of perfumes, flowers and so forth. A tremendous cloud poured forth rain, and cool and dense mists from the snow-region surrounded the great Bodhi-tree on every side. Seven days did the great Bodhi-tree abide there, awaking faith among the people invisible in the region of the snow. At the end of the week all the clouds vanished and the great Bodhi-tree became visible and the rays of six colours. The great thera Mahinda and the bhikkhuni Samghamitta went thither with their following and the king also with his following. The nobles of Kajaragama and the nobles of Candanagama and the Brabman Tivakka and the people too who dwelt in the island came thither also by the power of the gods, (with minds) eagerly set upon a festival of the great Bodhi-tree. Amid this great assembly, plunged into amazement by this miracle, there grew out of the east branch, even as they gazed, a faultless fruit.
This having fallen off the thera took it up and gave it to the king to plant. In a golden vase filled with earth mingled with perfumes, placed on the spot where the Mahääsana (afterwards) was, the ruler planted it. And while they all yet gazed, there grew, springing from it, eight shoots; and they stood there, young Bodhi-trees four cubits high.
The great theri Samghamitta, who longed for a quiet dwelling-place, because of the too great crowding of the vihara where she dwelt, she who was mindful for the progress of the doctrine and the good of the bhikkhunis, the wise one who desired another abode for the bhikkhunis went (once) to the fair cetiya-house, pleasant by its remoteness, and there she the skilled (in choice) of dwelling-places, the blameless, stayed the day through. When the king came to the convent for bhikkhunis to salute the theri, he, hearing that she had gone thither, went also and when he had greeted her there and talked with her and had heard the wish that was the cause of her going thither, then did he, who was skilled in (perceiving) the desires (of others), the wise, the great monarch Devänampiya-tissa, order to be erected a pleasing convent for the bhikkhunis round about the thüpa-house. Since the convent for the bhikkhunis was built near to the elephant-post therefore was it known by the name Hatthälhaka-vihära.
The well-beloved, the great theri Samghamitta of lofty wisdom now took up her abode in this pleasing convent for bhikkhunis. Bringing about in such wise the good of the dwellers in Lañkä, the progress of the doctrine, the king of trees, the great Bodhi-tree, lasted long time on the island of Lanka, in the pleasant Mahamegha-grove, endowed with many wondrous powers. Here ends the nineteenth chapter, called ‘The Coming of the Bodhi-tree’, in the Mahavamsa, compiled for the serene joy and emotion of the pious.
