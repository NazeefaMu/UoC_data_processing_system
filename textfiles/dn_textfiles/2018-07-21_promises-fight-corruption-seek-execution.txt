Promises to fight corruption seek execution

President Maithripala Sirisena has certainly given a good message to the foreign community about the key initiatives taken by this government to break the nexus between power and corruption in Sri Lanka. He showed how the Unity Government led by him elected in January 2015, had removed most of the enormous powers of the Executive Presidency in Sri Lanka.
Addressing the inaugural meeting of the Open Government Partnership Global Summit 2018 at Tbilisi, Georgia, this week, he spoke of steps taken by Sri Lanka to promote the principles elating to Open Government Partnership, by the coalition of unity. He emphasized on the 19th Amendment to the Constitution, which strengthened Parliament, and the Constitutional Council, which brought independence to the Chief Justice and judges of the Supreme Court, the Attorney General, and the benefits of independence from the Commissions on Police, Human Rights, Bribery and Corruption and the Right to Information.
While the presidential message to the foreign community given from Georgia could be encouraging, the situation here raises much concern about the policies and principles of the government, especially with regard to its pledge to fight the corruption of the previous government, and the expectations of building a much cleaner structure of governance in the country. The differences within the government keeps widening, and the new issues that have come to the fore in recent weeks are causing considerable discontent both within the government, and the wider public, which shows little proof of an effective fight against corruption, while raising fears about the return to a much stronger authoritarian rule in the country.
Hanging debate
President Sirisena’s recent statement of his willingness to carry out the death penalty on those convicted of crimes relating to the promotion of drugs, and Cabinet approval given to it, has opened a strongly divisive public debate, moving away from the pressing realities of government, especially issues of economic hardship affecting the people that need urgent attention. This is largely a debate moved by emotion and feelings about capital punishment, with little to do with a properly planned fight against the forces engaged in the promotion of drug use in the country.
“The Hanging Question”, as headlined in the Editorial Page ‘Hindsight’ column in the Daily News on last Wednesday (19th), shows the diversity of the debate that has been unleashed, raising the important question whether President Sirisena will be able to follow through with his declared intentions, on the spread of drug related crimes, and the use of the death penalty. He certainly has to take note of opposition to the move by the Human Rights Commission of Sri Lanka, and the clear opposition organisations of Civil Society, by the Christian community as stated strongly by the Anglican Church, and the somewhat confusing duality on drugs and the death penalty by the Catholic Church in Sri Lanka.
The noticeable silence by the Buddhist clergy on this matter, which is deeply associated with the core teachings of Buddhism, shows the deeper influence of politics in the thinking on this issue by important sections of the Buddhist clergy.
Meanwhile, the Joint Opposition (JO) has moved to the politics of practicality by stating that the Death Penalty debate unleashed is a political move to hide other burning issues affecting the people. The JO would prefer a situation where its leaders do not have to be divided on this issue, but be strongly united on other issues such as the punishment to be imposed on MP Vijayakala, for raising the LTTE issue, which is the stuff for political action for Sinhala majoritarian strategies.
The JO must be pleased at the divergent role this debate has taken in the public mind and the media, because it moves away from the emerging conflicts within its own ranks, and its leaders, too, over the selection of the next presidential candidate. Such a diversion is welcome when there is increasing criticism on the commitment to a new rise of the Rajapaksa Pavula, in the authoritarian trend at the core of SLPP politics today.
Noose of uncertainty
We read about the names of those death penalty convicts in prison, whose sentences have been commuted, and possibly now await a new sentence from President Sirisena. The prison authorities on the lookout for a new hangman or two have received offers from volunteer hangmen and “hangwomen” too. The Execution Chamber is being fully restored to carry out the new punishments, after more than 40 years. However, there is no certainty about this ‘hangman’s pledge’ being carried out, whatever the presidential or Cabinet promise.
There is a clear judicial issue the President will have to face before any of such executions are carried out. Those to be executed under the new presidential statement and Cabinet decision are those already sentenced to death for drug related crimes, who have been engaged in such work (or crimes) while serving one’s commuted death sentence. There is the need for judicially accepted proof of such new crimes, committed after the committal of the original sentence, which brought them to death row in prison. This will need thorough investigation, as well as explanations of the role of the Prison Authorities in allowing such new crimes to be committed, or how convicted criminals prevented the Prison officials from stopping such drug-related criminal activity.
This is certainly no easy task with the necessity of the complete participation of prison authorities in proving these new crimes. Many who have studied the emerging situation are of the view that it looks like another failure that will mar the record of the Executive Presidency after the 19th Amendment.
The uncertainty of this hangman’s noose brings into focus a far wider task this government will have to be faced with in the coming months. It is the action needed to carry out a complete overhaul of the Prison System in the country, taking into consideration the modern advances made in the confining and treatment of prisoners. This also requires more equality in the treatment of prisoners, unlike what takes place today – with the rich and powerful – in politics, governance and business – assured of considerable comforts and facilities that are wholly denied to the average prisoners.
President Sirisena and the Coalition of Unity, amidst its many divisions, certainly has a great task before them, something not thought of by the Common Candidate and the campaign to elect him in 2014/2015 – to carry out far reaching Prison Reforms. This is something Sri Lanka should be able to tell the world at international conferences in Georgia or elsewhere in the future – as the new example of prison standards in South Asia.
Hanging over
The Hanging Question would take the pressing issues of politics and governance away for some time. However, the pressures of unaddressed issues in the fight against corruption will be seen in the coming months, as the country moves closer to the next Presidential and General Elections.
The big promises made about a new “Gamperaliya” or the achievement of economic success by 2050, do not remove from the public mind the pledges of the Common Candidate to fight the corruption of the Rajapaksa Regime. While there is pride in the new independence of the judiciary, there are also fears, whether the recusals by judges in particular cases, and the time taken to hold the next hearing (with the possibility of another recusal) is part of strategic thinking to take such cases, and the persons involved in them, beyond the next Presidential and General Election?
The opposition candidacy for the next presidential election have two brothers who are debarred from contesting, being US citizens, awaiting nomination by the other brother who is banned from contesting through the 19th Amendment. Political activists in social media are now suggesting that the fraternal disagreements – involving the political future of Namal Rajapaksa – could lead to Rajapaksa’s wife – Shiranthi – being the next family candidate.
The possibility of such situations to be even considered is wholly due to the failure of both the UNP and SLFP – led by Ranil Wickremesinghe and Maithripala Sirisena to take the necessary and timely action to bring to book the Rajapaksas and their supporters involved in the corruption of the past regime. The public keeps reading of the slow progress in the moves to bring to justice the killers of Lasantha Wickrematunge and those who carried away Prageeth Eknaligoda. The new independence of the judiciary is taking us far beyond the judicial delays of the past, raising many new questions about the need for new speed in the execution of political promises of those elected by the people.
The debate on the Hangman is giving way to a call to tighten the noose on those who give false promises to the people, and fail to carry out their pledges to society. The forces of civil society and the politically independent public will have to seek to leaders with a new commitment to fight corruption to meet the challenges of tomorrow. Challenges that can give a new meaning to the politics of the future.
