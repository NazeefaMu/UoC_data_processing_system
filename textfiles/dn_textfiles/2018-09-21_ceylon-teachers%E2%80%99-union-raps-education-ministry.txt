Ceylon Teachers’ Union raps Education Ministry

The Ceylon Teachers’ Union said it condemned the attempt made by the Education Ministry to offer official recognition to private education by getting representatives of private universities to attend principals’ meetings organised through Zonal Education Offices.
Principals’ meetings convened by the Ministry and schools themselves facilitate curriculum development in private universities.
The Ceylon Teachers’ Union in a press release, stated that offering of state resources for the development of private schools and private universities in this manner by a government which came to power on a pledge to enhance free education was a grave national crime.
Moreover, the Education Ministry recently chose a private university in its vicinity as the venue to conduct a training workshop for sectional heads of national schools. The workshop held by the ministry under its own expenditure had helped to boost that private university.
The Education Ministry should immediately stop this action relating to the private sector by wasting its funds intended to develops education in government schools.
The union highlighted this danger during a discussion between Education Unions, and the Education Minister and his officials on September 17.
