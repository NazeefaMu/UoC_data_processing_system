Provide soft loans for solar power panels
I thank Power and Renewable Energy Minister Ranjith Siyabalapitiya for his great enthusiasm and efforts in providing solar power panel to all schools in Sri Lanka.
I greatly appreciate his sincere gratitude of reciprocating the people of the Kegalle District for electing him to parliament for 18 years by providing solar panels to each and every house. His first initiative is very much laudable to give the solar panels to schools where rural and remote schools would be greatly benefitted.
Getting solar power panels to households’ costs immensely for the consumers. They will not think of getting it unless the Ministry of Power and Renewable Energy finds a method of assisting them through providing soft interest-free loans.
I agree that Sri Lanka may be the only country, providing power round the clock, but there are defects and shortcomings of the CEB employees who fail to provide electricity for 24 hours. In my area, Aranayaka, Dippitiya, Mawatahagoda, the supply is interrupted at least for a day every week for more than seven hours. We have to inform the hotline to restore the supply but getting them online is a Herculean task.
While appreciating the minister for his commitment to providing electricity cheaper to the consumers by fixing solar power panels, I request him to look into the above matter too.
