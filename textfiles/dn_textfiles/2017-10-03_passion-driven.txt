Passion driven

Soprano Tharanga Goonetilleke’s life achievements are enviable and admirable. She will be performing with the Symphony Orchestra of Sri Lanka on October 19 at Ladies College.
Being a native of Sri Lanka, she graduated with her Artist Diploma for Opera Studies as well as her Master of Music degree in Voice and Opera at the Juilliard School. She has a Bachelor of Music degree from Converse College, Spartanburg, SC, USA with a minor in Biology. She is also an Associate of the Trinity College of Music, London, England.
In her home country, Goonetilleke made her solo debut with The Symphony Orchestra of Sri Lanka (SOSL) after winning the Concerto Competition of Sri Lanka in 1998. In addition, she has won the Trinity College of Music examination prizes in singing for three consecutive years for which achievement she was awarded the Yamaha Trophy in 1997. Since then she has been a frequent performer with the SOSL.
In the US she has been adjudged a winner in both New York and South Carolina districts at the Metropolitan Opera National Council auditions. She is also a winner of the Palmetto Opera competition in Columbia, SC. The Sri Lanka Association in California presented her with an Award of Excellence in performance. At Juilliard she was awarded the Makiko Narumi Memorial prize and is a recipient of the Sing for Hope Grant awarded to recent alumni of Julliard. Goonetilleke is the first woman from Sri Lanka to be accepted to the prestigious Juilliard School.
Daily News contacted Goonetilleke and spoke about the woman behind the mike, the woman off stage.
“My first music teacher was my mom. Then I studied voice with Christine Perera and piano with Ponraja and Prema Ratnayake while I was in Sri Lanka. Then I studied voice with Dr. Beverly Hay (Converse College, SC, USA) and Marlena Malas (The Juilliard School, NY, USA),” said Goonetilleke.
The concert is very special for Goonetilleke for two reasons. First, this concert will be dedicated to the memory of Dr. Earl de Fonseka who was the founder of SOSL.
“I was lucky enough to have met him and sing for him in the late 1990s and he encouraged me to continue on the path of music for which I am truly grateful. Second, this would be my first time performing under the baton of Dushyanthi Perera whose cello playing and musicality has always been an inspiration to me especially as a child growing up in Sri Lanka,” stated Goonetilleke.
Her passion for music is thrilling and inspiring. Her performances are magical and can lift anyone up from the doldrums. It is this mutual passion for music, this collaboration that will make the performance to remember for a very long time.
“Whether I am singing with the SOSL or any other symphony anywhere else in the world, the process is the same. As the soloist, I only will be present for two or three rehearsals before the concert. And when I attend the first rehearsal, the orchestra and I have independently rehearsed the music well enough to be able to adjust, to meet mutually in musical sensibilities and temperament. Flexibility is key on everyone’s part. The success of the work of both parties (myself and the orchestra) is very much dependent on how well we all know the music and how much of our heart we are willing to expose. It is a large responsibility for anyone on stage. The more vulnerable the musicians are the more exciting and the more magical the performance will be,” explained Goonetilleke.
Lost in the music she discovers herself. Lost in the music she finds her purpose in life. Lost in her music she reaches deep within herself and lives up to her potential which is massive. Her talent is impressive. The more she performs the more she grows as a musician. The more she is able to share that part of herself with us and lift us up. And listening to her, we discover a part of ourselves as well.
“I feel that it is probably because there is nothing else that makes me feel that I am fully myself except when I am totally lost in music. I do write music and poetry for fun. However, I don’t perform them professionally. Singing and voice training alone consume us,” said Goonetilleke
There is no better person who can deliver a message to any young person who wants to enter the music industry other than Goonetilleke.
“Don’t get ‘passion’ and ‘fun’ mixed up. If you are in music because it is fun, it could simply be a passing interest. Passion will last a lifetime and you will be heartbroken if you don’t give it a chance. Anything you do only for fun can be replaced by the next fun thing that comes along. So, when you chose your career, hopefully you will evaluate these differences. The music industry and career is not always fun but it is full of passion; it is a mix of electricity, heartache, exhilaration, freedom, liberation and more, in combination with unwavering hard work,” informed Goonetilleke.
She is a permanent resident of the USA and tries to come to Sri Lanka every two years or so if she can. The artistes she admires are Kiri te Kanawa, Leontyne Price, Lorraine Hunt Lieberson, Renee Fleming, and Sarah Connolly.
“I founded TharangArt. It is a visual arts project I started during a period of time a couple of years back when I was medically advised to be on bed rest. I thought I’d go crazy if I didn’t have a way to channel my creative energy somewhere. I took up drawing. Since then I have shown my artwork at least in a dozen shows, some of my designs are used in the Julliard store at Lincoln center etc. Lately I am working on collaborating these two different artistic outlets. For example, when I get back to the USA in November I will be travelling to Canada to perform a recital at Wilfred Laurier University while I will be displaying some of my artwork they have commissioned,” explained Goonetilleke.
In 2015, she became a TED Fellow and it has been a life- changing honor for her. When asked as to what sustains her and strengthens her, she pointed out that it is her God, her two children, her husband and music and art.
“Ladies’ College education has impacted me in every imaginable way, whether it is professional or personal. I was in school with a remarkably intelligent, talented and compassionate batch of women at Ladies. They along with my wonderful teachers have made me the woman I am today by allowing me unwrap the girl I was then,” summed up Goonetilleke.
