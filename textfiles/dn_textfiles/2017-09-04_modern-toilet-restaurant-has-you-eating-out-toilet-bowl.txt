Modern Toilet Restaurant has you eating out of a toilet bowl!

This is as strange a restaurant as it can get. And no I am not kidding, this is the ‘Toilet Bowl Restaurant’ located at Ximending. Well, the colourful Taiwan also has eating locales that resemble jailhouses and hospitals.
Let’s see. You walk in, and sit on covered toilet bowls (which is kind of hard and uncomfortable). You eat on a glass table which is on top of a bath tub. The brown mushy curry comes in a mini-black plastic toilet bowl, fries in bath-tubs and drinks are served in miniature urinal. It makes reading newspaper on the bowl more appropriate.
The first “Marton” Toilet Restaurant opened in 2004 in Taipei by Wang Tzi-Wei and a group of “muckrakers”, inspired by a cartoon Dr. Slump that featured a toilet drawing on a menu. It first started with selling chocolate ice cream on toilet bowl plates and has been flushing with success ever since.
Anybody in the right mind should order a Modern Toilet Chicken Curry (NT 200 or SGD$8.60) which is like gooey sauce with a sad looking broccoli in the middle. The soft carrots make the dish look like a form of diarrhoea. Anyway, just eat it and it should taste like a sweeter version of Japanese curry.
The Mediterranean Seafood Au Gratin (NT 250 or SGD$10.70) comes in a less exciting form – a mini bath tub. The food generally is not fantastic, but definitely decent and more fun to eat from. Not restaurant standard, but should be better than fast food.
Order something like dark chocolate ice cream and you will have a bizzare time, shooting all combinations of yourself playing with s*** This is crazy place and people love it. You can seal the deal by washing your hands… in a toilet bowl!
