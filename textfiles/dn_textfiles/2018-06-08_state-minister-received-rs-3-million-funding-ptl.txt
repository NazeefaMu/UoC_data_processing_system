KODAGODA REVEALS police GUARD’s SUBMISSION:
State Minister received Rs. 3 million funding from PTL

The Colombo Fort Magistrate was told yesterday that a State Minister had received Rs three million from W. M. Mendis and Company on three occasions.
The company is related to Perpetual Treasuries Limited (PTL), being closely involved in the Treasury Bond issue.
Senior Additional Solicitor Genaral Yasantha Kodagoda appearing on behalfof the CID submitted before Colombo Fort Magistrate Lanka Jayaratne that a certain State Minister had made his police guard to change Rs 1 million cash cheque on August 24, 2015.
He further submitted that this state minister had got his second cheque of Rs 1 million on November 12 and the third cheque on March 31, 2016.
Kodagoda submitted that following the incident the Sub Inspector (the state minister’s security officer) had given a statement to the FCID.
The Magistrate ordered the further remand of Perpetual Treasuries Limited (PTL) beneficiary owner Arjun Aloysius and its Chief Executive Officer Kasun Palisena until June 21 yesterday.
He added that a statement given by Amila Dahanayaka, the secretary to former Central Bank Governor Arjuna Mahendran, had said that Mahendran had used a credit card issued by the Central Bank which had no credit limit.
He also added that it was revealed that Arjuna Mahendran had utilised three cheques worth Rs 3.2 million received by W. M. Mendis Company in order to repay the credit balance on his credit card.
Senior Additional Solicitor General Kodagoda further informed court that the CID is in the process of taking necessary legal action for the extradition of Arjun Mahendran under the extradition note since the Singaporean authorities are reluctant to arrest him based on a warrant issued by Sri Lanka.
He told court that former SLFP Minister Dayasiri Jayasekara who had failed to appear before the CID on several occasions after being summoned, had stated that he would provide a statement on the Rs 1 million cheque that he received to the CID on Monday. If Jayasekera does not keep his promise, SASG Kodagoda stated that necessary legal action will be taken to ensure his appearance.
