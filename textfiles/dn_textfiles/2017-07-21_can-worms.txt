A can of worms

The breakthrough made in the underground activities of certain high ranking officers in the security forces has, no doubt, opened a can of worms which is bound to cast a pall on the tales of valour and heroics of the armed forces in general during the Eelam war. This side of the dark picture of the war against terrorism escaped the public attention largely because all the focus was on the battle and the capture of towns, hitherto held by the LTTE, dominating the news. This climate provided the ideal backdrop for sinister forces to put into operation their dark deeds knowing that these will be subsumed in the cacophony of victories announced on a daily basis, as the forces kept marching on.
These sinister forces were well aware that in the prevailing triumphalist milleu the public will refuse to believe any wrongdoing on the part of the forces, and, even if they did, the larger picture of the war victory would have vested them with immunity. On the other hand, this was the time when the minority Tamils, especial those wealthy, were most vulnerable to the machinations of these evil forces, being defeated and isolated on all fronts, what with the victory juggernaut marching on. Hence, the coast was clear for those unsavoury elements within the security forces and police to make hay while sun shines.
No sooner the new government was elected to power, investigations were launched into the seamier side of the security establishment. What is now being unearthed is a whole subterranean world of intrigue, crime and cover ups, with names, hitherto held sacrosanct, being exposed.
The latest to be arrested is Commodore D. K. P. Dassanayake, former Navy spokesman. He was taken into custody from the Welisara Naval base after investigations revealed his role in the abduction of 11 persons in and around Colombo in 2008. All the abductees, barring two, were members of the Tamil community. It has transpired during the investigations that the abductions were carried out for ransom demands. The missing persons were abducted by an unidentified group in Dehiwela, Battaramulla and Wattala in 2008 and 2009. This was a time when the war was fought in all its intensity and where impunity reigned, with Tamil nationals selectively targeted, the operations masterminded by high ranking officers of the security forces and the police. The law, as they say, is silent during times of war and this exactly was the case during the closing stages of the Eelam war. It was also a time when the dreaded White Van roamed the streets picking up journalists and critics of the government, with the war giving blanket cover for these deeds.
Commodore Dassanayake is now being held in remand. He was brought to court in an ambulance, following a pattern that is associated with our politicians but a poor reflection on a ‘war hero’ for whose release there is today a huge clamour by JO politicians, the Sangha and pan nationalist bodies, who are accusing the government carrying out witch-hunt against an individual who was in the forefront to defeat terrorists. The accusations sometimes verge on the bizarre, with the Ven. Uduwe Dhammaloka attributing all the natural disasters and calamities to visit the country on the arrest of the country's ‘war heroes'.
No one recalls what calamity befell the nation when the greatest war hero of them all, the war winning former Army Commander, was dragged away and thrown in jail. Certainly not the fall from power of those responsible for this dastardly deed.
That ’77 avalanche
Today marks 40 years in the landslide victory of the UNP in 1977. The first result announced was Samanthurai, won by M. A. Abdul Majeed, that heralded the UNP avalanche that ended with 138 seats for the party, with the SLFP reduced to 8 (including three multi-member constituencies) and the Left completely wiped off the electoral map. Even JRJ, it was said, was astounded by the enormity of the victory which secured for the UNP a five sixth majority in parliament.
Up until then, whenever the UNP won, it was always with a very slender majority, and, more often than not, it had to cobble together a coalition to obtain a working majority, as happened under Dudley in 1965.
The 1977 victory also threw up many dynamics. It ushered in the first Executive Presidency in the country with the introduction of a new constitution. For the first time in post Independent Sri Lanka, a member of a minority party was installed as Leader of the Opposition (A. Amirthalingam -TULF). The UNP victory also a marked watershed in the country's socio-economic sphere with the introduction of the market economy throwing open Sri Lanka to the outside world and set the tone for a revolution on the development front.
There are today only a handful of survivors of that mind-boggling electoral triumph of the Grand Old Party, with Ranil Wickremesinghe, then a fresh faced youth, today soldering on as Prime Minister.
