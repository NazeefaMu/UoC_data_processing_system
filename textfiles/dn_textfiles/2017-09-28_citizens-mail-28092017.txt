Citizen's Mail [28.09.2017]

 Can you categorize missing persons?
After eighteen months a belated gazette has been signed. This means, that this country has acknowledged, that persons have gone missing, and must be accounted for. To us the ordinary citizens all persons who have gone missing must be investigated and their final fate must be made public.
It is universally accepted among civilised, democratic nations, that no person must be involuntarily lost or missing. But how come, our learned lawyer prime minister said recently, that the organisation of missing persons will only investigate persons missing from the date of signing the gazette.
If so, this gazette is not necessary, since under the good governance no disappearances have taken place. He seems to have forgotten that this whole exercise of missing persons was initiated after the civil war ended.
This was an essential component in the UN declaration. The problem with the Sri Lankan politicians is that since 1948, they are accustomed to placate its citizens here and there.
This has led to the mistrust of the people particularly the minorities and the divisions are getting farther than closer.
But they are believing that their rhetoric day in and day out, by showing a few minorities here and there, holding hands and by distributing Cabinet positions, and positions in the government service will automatically resolve all minority issues, which is simmering and someday, they will rise to get back what they believe, as lost.
