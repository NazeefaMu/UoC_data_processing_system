‘Public sector basic salary will be Rs. 28,000 by 2020’

A lowest wage receiver in the public sector will get a basic salary of Rs. 28,000 by year 2020, Home Affairs Minister Vajira Abeywardena yesterday said. He said the government since 2015 has increased the basic salary of government employees.
Minister Abeywardena was speaking at the ceremony held at Temple Trees to hand over appointment letters to 4,100 graduates for the posts of Development Officer.
Minister Abeywardena told new development officers to assist the giant development leap that the government is taking now.
“In 2015, the basic salary of a public servant in the lowest salary scale was Rs. 12,000. In 2015, we made it Rs. 13,000. Then in 2017, we increased it to Rs. 18,000. In 2018, it will become Rs. 22,000,” Minister Abeywardena said.
“When you were in the university, you may have supported various political groups. You might have all sorts of political affiliations. That is natural. Now you have become public officers and you are bound to work as a part of a government. You cannot disturb or hinder government operations,” he said.
Youth Affairs and Southern Development Minister Sagala Ratnayaka said the graduates who received appointments as development officers will undergo a proper training. “We have expanded the capacity of our training centres to give these officers a proper training. It was difficult for us to absorb all the graduates into the government service. That is why we are doing it in three stages,” the Minister said.
Minister Ratnayaka said people need to be creative in finding new ways to generate income. He said the new officers should take the responsibility of the economic development of the country. “Now your future is secured with a government job. It is time that you help us create a secured future for the country,” he said.
