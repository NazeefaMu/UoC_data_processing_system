Consular Affairs Division moves to new premises

The Foreign Ministry Consular Affairs Division at the BOI building, 3rd Floor at No.14, Sir Baron Jayathilake Mawatha in Fort, will be relocated to the Ceylinco Building, 2nd Floor, No. 69 Janadhipathi Mawatha, Colombo 1 from today.
The new premise will be opened by Minister Mangala Samaraweera today. The Foreign Minister will also launch a state of the art electronic Document Attestation System (e-DAS) that will reduce processing time for document attestation, with a quick verification process linked in real-time with Sri Lanka Missions and Consulates abroad, as well as other government institutions.
An online system for appointments and payments will also be in place at the new premise.
The new premise will be open to the public from tomorrow. However, to ensure uninterrupted service, consular services will continue to be made available at the BOI building until further notice.
