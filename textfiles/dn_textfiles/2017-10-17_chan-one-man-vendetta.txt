Jackie Chan goes up against Pierce Brosnan and the IRA in an old-fashioned suspense movie from the director of ‘Casino Royale’, ‘Golden Eye’ and ‘Edge of Darkness”
It’s a story of humble London businessman Quan (Chan), whose long-buried past erupts in a revenge-fueled vendetta when the only person left for him to love -- his teenage daughter -- is taken from him in a senseless act of politically-motivated terrorism. In his relentless search for the identity of the terrorists, Quan is forced into a cat-and-mouse conflict with a British government official (Brosnan), whose own past may hold clues to the identities of the elusive killers.
