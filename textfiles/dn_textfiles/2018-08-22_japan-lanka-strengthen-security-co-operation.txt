Japan, Lanka to strengthen security co-operation

Japan - Sri Lanka co-operation in the field of Maritime security is to be further strengthened.
Attention was drawn towards this matter during discusisons held between President Maithripala Siresena and visiting Defence Minister of Japan Itsunori Onodera when the latter called on him at the Presidential Secretariat in Colombo yesterday morning.
The President’s Media Unit in a press release said this was the first time in the country’s history that a Defence Minister of Japan is visiting Sri Lanka. Itsunori Ondera who is on a two day was warmly received by President Maithripala Sirisena.
The discussions also reviewed the progress achieved in implementing the agreements reached during President Sirisena’s state visit to Japan earlier. Attention was drawn towards further widening bilateral relations between Sri Lanka and Japan and strengthening defence cooperation between the two countries.
As a result of the talks between President Maithripala Sirisena with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe earlier, Japan has donated Coast Guard ships valued at Rs. 1.8 billion to Sri Lanka.
President Sirisena made use of this opportunity to thank the Japanese Defence Minister for this donation. President Sirisena also expressed his happiness about the Japanese Defence Minister’s planned visit to the Hambantota and Trincomalee Ports and said that joint programmes for Coast Guard operations in Sri Lanka would be further improved in future.
