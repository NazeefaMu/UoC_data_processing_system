Rajapaksa terms new Inland Revenue Act, unacceptable

Former President Mahinda Rajapaksa on Monday, said the Bill to replace the Inland Revenue Act No: 10 of 2006 was unacceptable.
The Bill is to be taken up in Parliament on Friday (25). "We oppose this Inland Revenue Bill for several reasons," Rajapaksa said in a media statement.
Citing reasons he said, under Clause 5(2)(f) of the Bill, the employer’s contribution to a provident fund will be considered a part of an employee’s taxable income and it will make EPF payments a burden to employees.
“Under Item 8 of its first schedule, the tax on income generated by provident funds through their investments will increase from the present 10 percent to 14 percent, thus reducing the income available to fund members,” he added.
He also criticized the clauses which refers to the amendments regarding the tax imposed on places of worship .
“Furthermore, the existing 2006 Inland Revenue Act provides concessions through Chapter III on tax exemptions to various fields deemed worthy of preservation such as local handicraft industries, film and drama producers etc. This Chapter also has concessions for various economic activities such as new undertakings in pharmaceuticals, renewable energy, production for import substitution etc. There are over 200 such exemptions in the present law. All those concessions are to be removed by the proposed new law,” he added..
Rajapaksa noted, “Independent professionals are at present taxed at flat rates for incomes above the tax free threshold of Rs. 500,000, at 12 percent for up to Rs. 25 million a year, going up to 16 percent for anything above 35 million. Under the proposed law, professionals will be taxed at the rates applicable to individuals, tax free for the first Rs. 600,000 and for each succeeding Rs. 600,000 at rates starting at 4 percent and increasing gradually to 8 percent, 12 percent, 16 percent, 20 percent with the maximum rate of 24 percent applying to any income above Rs.3 million a year. The income tax for professionals had been kept low so as to encourage them to remain in Sri Lanka without moving overseas.”
He also found fault with rental income being subjected to a 10percent withholding tax.
Rajapaksa also criticized giving more power to the Commissioner General in the new Bill.
He said the policy on which the proposed new Inland revenue law is based, is in keeping with the ideology of the UNP but is contrary to that of the SLFP.
He urged all MPs of the SLFP to vote against the Bill when it comes up in Parliament.
