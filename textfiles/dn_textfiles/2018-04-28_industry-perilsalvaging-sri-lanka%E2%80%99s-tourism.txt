An industry in peril:Salvaging Sri Lanka’s tourism:

Continued from yesterday
Meanwhile, Beach parties which continue beyond the legal time cause more harm than good to the tourist industry and the environment alleged tourist hotel owners and environmentalists. There are Beach Parties seven days a week on the Mirissa Beach which go on till dawn during the peak of the tourist season and it is at one such beach party that a group of Dutch tourists were harassed and later assaulted by a group of local miscreants.
“Locals are not welcome at most beach parties unless they accompany tourists,” said an operator of one such establishment. “Local guests try to get too familiar with female tourists and result in incidents like this,” he added. As a result, some establishments even displayed ‘Foreigners Only’ notices which resulted in much controversy in the past.
At the Mirissa tourist zone where Beach Parties are held seven days a week during the tourist season the parties start off at around 8.30 or 9.00 pm and go on until 2.00 am or 3.00 am. High powered laser beams light up the waves while the sound of DJ music could be heard for miles.
“Marine life on the shoreline is at risk due to the use of high powered laser beams and high decibel music that emanates at night at some of the tourist attractions which are advertised as Beach Parties,” cautioned an environmentalist. “The tourist industry should be developed but not by harming the attractions that draw the tourists to the country. If the authorities do not take immediate action to control the situation the tourist industry is going to suffer further,” he added.
Sri Lanka losing its reputation as a family-friendly destination?
“I planned to stay in Mirissa with my family for five days but there was so much noise at a nearby hotel last night which went on till 4 am this morning that we decided to leave. I complained to the hotel management and even to the Police about the noise but no one stopped it,” complained a disgruntled tourist who was loading her bags into a vehicle. “Mirissa was a quiet and calm beach at night when I came to Sri Lanka five years ago. I loved to watch the turtles come ashore to lay their eggs but I am told that they stay away due to the lights and noise,” she added.
“Guests come to Sri Lanka to get away from their hectic work schedules and relax. They cherish the serene and quiet locations. Mirissa beach is an ideal location at the day where tourists can take in the sun and swim without being bothered by beach boys, vendors or beggars. There are over 3000 hotel rooms within the Mirissa tourist zone but only a few tourists attend these beach parties. In-house guests complain to us every day and we, in turn, complain to the police but no action is being taken as the authorities concerned are paid large sums by those who organise these events to turn a deaf ear to the happenings on the beach,” said a hotel owner within the Mirissa tourist zone who did not want to be named.
“There is certainly a reduction in the number of families visiting the Unawatuna and Mirissa areas in comparison with the past. However, I market my hotel as a family hotel and I do get lots of families, old people, people with disabilities etc. However, the idea is to have a mix where you cater to all types of people and attract a mix of tourists both young and old, single and families,” said Paloma Scott.
Unlicensed hotels ruining the upmarket tourist industry
According to Paloma Scott, as most of these unlicensed tourist places keep reducing their prices, which they certainly can afford to do as they don’t pay any of the overhead charges, then the rest is also forced to keep their prices down in order to stay competitive. As a result, the tourism industry will suffer in the long run as the country will tend to attract more of the backpackers rather than the high-end visitors. “I am not saying that they should not be welcomed, but the authorities must be mindful of not deterring the high-end tourists by attracting only the backpackers. There must be proper standards maintained. If you want to attract more respectable types of guests with families and high spenders, Sri Lanka needs to market itself as an upmarket destination. Not all luxury but as a middle and upmarket destination. You cannot stop the backpackers and certainly no one wants to stop it but currently, Sri Lanka is going too much into the backpacker way. The rates are being pushed down due to the competition posed by the unlicensed tourist spots while the cost of labour taxes etc. and other costs of the legitimate businesses are skyrocketing. Hence, there is no level playing field for all engaged in the tourism industry. Therefore, there is the danger that such legitimate businesses will not find it profitable to operate and before long the country will serve only as a backpacker destination that will deter the high spending tourists that will benefit the country,” she noted.
However, she regretted that the country’s labour laws are draconian for an employer and the days of cheap labour is no more. “This is fine as people need to be paid well I accept. So the whole operation has become so expensive. I sometimes wonder why I keep going when I barely have enough left after I pay all my taxes and expenses. But I see this country as my country and I go on as a service to my country as I have a birthright. But Sri Lanka needs to look at itself carefully. The problem is the megalomaniac ministers who seem to be grabbing everything and controlling everything. There needs to be a wholesale change. All the issues the country faces is symptomatic of the rot that is sitting at the top,” she said.
Meanwhile, Minister of Southern Development and Youth Affairs Sagala Ratnayaka noted that the government is determined not to lose out on what has been developed in Mirissa, Kamburugamuwa and Weligama over the last few years.
“Several meetings are taking place to bring this situation back into a positive. All the Provincial Councillors of the area, Pradeshiya Sabha officials members of the Provincial Councils and all members of the responsible government officers met with the members of the tourism industry in these areas to have a discussion where we take collective responsibility without waiting for the law and order situation to be put in place. We want all to take responsibility to have a clean tourist industry in this area. We have also agreed to meet as a group, the police, government institution officials, pradeshiya sabha and provincial council, urban council members etc. and the representatives of the various tourism associations and the politicians to discuss issues and find proper solutions for these issues. It will start with Mirissa but we will extend it to Kamburugamuwa and Weligama as well. We need to come up with a system to self police themselves and bring law and order into the area,” he assured.
