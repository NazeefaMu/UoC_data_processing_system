Lalith Weeratunga appeals HC’s rejection of request to go abroad

Filing a revision application in the Court of Appeal, former Secretary to the President Lalith Weeratunge, who was convicted of misappropriating Rs. 600 million of funds belonging to TRC, yesterday sought Court’s jurisdiction to set aside the Colombo High Court's decision to reject his request to go abroad.
On January 29, the Colombo High Court had rejected a request made by Weeratunge that he be allowed to go abroad.
When the revision application came up before Court of Appeal (President) Justice Preethi Padman Surasena and Justice Shiran Goonaratne, the matter was fixed for support on March 2. Weeratunga who was convicted of misappropriating Rs. 600 million of funds belonging to the Telecommunications Regulatory Commission (TRC) had sought the Colombo High Court’s permission to travel to Doha, Qatar and Australia in March and April.
While rejecting the application, High Court Judge Gihan Kulatunga had observed there is no legal basis to consider this application, since a person convicted of an offence has no the right to be presumed innocent.
The High Court Judge further observed that the accused’s request cannot be considered as an urgent requirement since his request was not based on a medical requirement.
On September 7, 2017, Weeratunga and Anusha Palpita were found guilty of misappropriating Rs. 600 million of funds belonging to TRC in the controversial sil redi (fabric used by devotees to observe sil) distribution case.
They were sentenced to three years’ rigorous imprisonment by the Colombo High Court.
They had filed appeal petitions in the Court of Appeal challenging the judgement of the Colombo High Court. They are currently out on bail.
