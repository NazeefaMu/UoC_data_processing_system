Army, a well-disciplined  fighting force: President

The Sri Lanka Army has been able to safeguard its proud national and international image because it is a well-disciplined fighting force, states President Maithripala Sirisena in a message of greetings to the Cormorant Strike 2017 military exercise.
It is centred in the Eastern Province with the participation of tri-forces delegates from 13 countries. The President, who viewed a simulated attack on an enemy camp conducted in Kuchchaveli Trincomalee as part of the exercise yesterday morning through satellite technology from his official residence, said his greetings go out to all local and foreign personnel and representatives involved in it. The President who also thanked all members of the Sri Lanka Army, foreign military leaders and ranks participating in the Cormorant Strike 2017, said a military exercise of this nature was essential to march forward through new technological military strategies and techniques.
