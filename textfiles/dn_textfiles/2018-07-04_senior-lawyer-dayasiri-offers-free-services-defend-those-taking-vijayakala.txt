Senior lawyer Dayasiri offers free services to defend those taking Vijayakala to Court

Senior Attorney-at-Law Gomin Dayasiri has offered his services free of charge to whomever who wished to take State Minister Vijayakala Maheswaran to court over her recent comments with regard to the LTTE.
The State Minister of Child Affairs in a speech delivered on Monday (2), stated that the Tamils needed to the LTTE if they are to live freely in the country. She stressed that women and children were safer under the terrorist organization.
“Through my example, I wish to teach a lesson to young lawyers that they can offer their services free to the nation and the soldiers who rendered a great service by eradicating terrorism in the country; with their lives, blood and limb to the cause,” Dayasiri said.
“As lawyers we have a responsibility to come forward. People like H.L.de Silva, S.A.Wickremanayake, H.S.Gunasekara appeared free in cases; in the question of merger-demerger of North East, the question of increasing powers of the Chief Minister of Northern Province, P-TOMS case and in the last case of getting all land distributed to the periphery by court orders of Shirani Bandaranayake and Sarath Silva back to the Central Government,” he further said.
Dayasiri explained that the laws in the country did not allow a government minister to support a banned terrorist organisation or to propagate terrorism in the country, “The President should take steps to remove her. It is bad for the country and party”.
“It was the Tamil people in the North who suffered most by terrorism in the North,” he added. The State Minister’s own husband, the late Uma Maheswaran too was killed by the LTTE.
