‘Ambassadors should not interfere in internal affairs’

Ambassadors should not interfere in the country's internal affairs, Sri Sudarshanarama Chief Incumbent Ven.Vijitha Thera said. He said that it had caused several issues in the new Cabinet.
The ven. thera was addressing a crowd during a special conference held at the National Library and Documentation Services Board, yesterday evening.
The Leader of the House should protect Parliamentary traditions, he said, adding that the political crisis could only be quelled by a general election.
The ven. thera said that religious leaders such as Ven. Dambara Amila Thera had attempted influence non-governmental organisations (NGOs) in order to aggravate the issue.
He added that certain parties such as the Tamil National Alliance and the Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna had chosen a different path to fulfil their personal needs, instead of the needs of the public.
The chief incumbent said that former Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe should stand down without abusing his powers any longer.
