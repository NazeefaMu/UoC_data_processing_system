From Best Friends to Soul mates

After Harbhajan Singh there is another legendary star from the Indian cricket world to make headlines and for the same reason in fact. The 'man in blue' we are talking about is Rohit Sharma, who is going to wield his bat elsewhere (we mean on the wedding fields!).
Indian Premier League's (IPL) team, Mumbai Indian's captain Rohit Sharma got engaged to Ritika Sajdeh, who is also his best friend and was his sports manager in the past on June 3, 2015. And now, it is time to cheer for the couple who will soon be marrying on December 13, 2015.
The star cricketer who is currently busy with the Test series against South Africa, will culminate his current relationship into marriage at a five star hotel in Bandra, Mumbai. The ceremony is expected to be a half-day affair. No doubt, he is too seasoned a player to be distracted with the dates, but the wedding is still fixed as per the schedule of the Test series.
A source close to Rohit told Mid-Day:"It is a good date and most importantly, there won't be any cricketing commitments for Rohit as the Test series against South Africa ends on December 7". As per various reports, the high-profile wedding would be attended by the legendary batsman, Sachin Tendulkar along with some other former and current cricketers. Preparations are on in full swing for these best friends to become life partners. Yahoo
