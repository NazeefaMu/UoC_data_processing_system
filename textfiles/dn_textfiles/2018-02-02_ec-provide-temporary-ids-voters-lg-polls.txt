EC to  provide  temporary IDs for voters  at LG polls

 
The Election Commission (EC) has commenced a programme to issue temporary identification (ID) cards to voters who currently do not possess any, in order to be eligible to vote at the forthcoming local government (LG) polls to be held countrywide on February 10.
Accordingly, for this purpose, applicants could apply for such IDs only today. The Election Commission has decided to accept only seven categories of IDs at the LG polls centres, countrywide.
Accordingly, National Identity Cards (NICs), valid passports, valid driving licenses, State Pensioners’ ID cards, ID cards issued to clergy by the Department of Registration of Persons, ID cards issued to senior citizens by the government, and temporary ID cards issued by the Election Commission.
Those who need temporary ID cards should immediately contact their respective Grama Niladharies (GNs) or Estate Superintendents for necessary application forms and details, with two bust photographs 11/4 x1” (inches) in size.
A circular by the Election Commission has been sent to all district secretaries and divisional secretaries, countrywide, in this regard, said North Western Provincial Council Senior Secretary D. M. Jayapala in Kurunegala, yesterday.
