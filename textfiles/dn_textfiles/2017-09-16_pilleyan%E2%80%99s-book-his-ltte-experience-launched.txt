Pilleyan’s book on his LTTE experience launched

Former Eastern Province Chief Minister Sivanesathurai Chandrakanthan alias ‘Pilleyan’ who is in remand has written a book describing his experiences in life from the time he was a member of the LTTE organisation.
The launching ceremony of the book titled “Wedkei” or ‘Sirei Payanna Kurippugal’, was held at the Chelvanayakam hall, Batticaloa recently.
Pilleyan said since he has been in remand for two years cut off from the outside world, he wrote the book to overcome his loneliness. Since Pilleyan was not able to attend the launching ceremony, the first copy of the book was presented to Pilleyan’s parents by Hindu Priest Sri Sivakumar.
Pilleyan is in remand in connection with the alleged murder of former Parliamentarian Joseph Pararajasinghem on December 25,2006.
