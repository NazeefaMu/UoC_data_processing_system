UNIS VERS le Sport boost football in Matara

Members of Unis Vers le Sport France were in the south of Sri Lanka to help boost football in Matara by providing much needed equipment to the football playing youth of the area.
UVS members both male and female played a fast game of football with the youth of Matara City Football Academy at the German Sri Lanka Friendship Football Ground at Uyanwatta before handing over their gifts. The match ended with both teams scoring one goal each but UVS won in the penalty shoot out.
In addition to providing football equipment to Matara City FC, the visitors from France were voluntarily renovating a school in the Witiyala area.
