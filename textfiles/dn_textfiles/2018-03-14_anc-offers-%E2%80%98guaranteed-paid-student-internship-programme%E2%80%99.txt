ANC offers ‘Guaranteed Paid Student Internship Programme’

ANC Education, has achieved yet another ‘first’ with its ‘Guaranteed Paid Student Internship Programme’ [PSI] which is the only of its kind in Sri Lanka.
“Today most parents don’t have the connections to send their children to Blue Chip Corporates due to the lack of corporate contacts. This is why ANC created GPSI where our students will get an opportunity to start their paid internships with Blue Chip Corporates, including multinational companies”, said CEO/ Executive Director ANC, Dr Punarjeeva Karunanayake.
“We believe that GPSI is the key differentiating factor in a highly competitive education industry. We have over 5000 graduates in the market right now who are holding key managerial positions. Their professionalism, analytical skills and communication skills have greatly contributed to the enviable reputation ANC enjoys today”
GPSI is the most vital step in higher education, because it ensures a great career with Blue chip Corporates in Sri Lanka. Not only does ANC offer multiple options to its students, but it ensures that students pursue their academic and professional dreams whilst learning to lead in their chosen fields.
GPSI is a partnership between ANC and 30 of the most reputed blue-chip Corporates in the island, where ANC provides special industry related degree programmes alongside a '6-12 month' Guaranteed Paid Internship in their final year from the partnered Blue Chip Corporates.
They will also be engaged in industrial visits and numerous workshops throughout their studentship, which will truly place them “One Step Ahead” of students attached to other institutes.
Students who avail themselves of ANC’s GPSI programme are not only academically validated but are industry validated as well having graduated with a years Corporate experience, thus placing them in a position where they can command a higher starting salary with Blue Chip Corporates, averaging Rs 75,000/-
