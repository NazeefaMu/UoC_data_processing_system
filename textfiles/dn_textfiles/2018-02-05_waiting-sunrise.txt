Waiting for Sunrise

The crowd stood stationary. No one dared even one step ahead. They were not bothered about the tired night they had spent climbing up to the peak. This sight was larger than life, and they were imbibing it.
Finally it dawned.
Sun slowly began to rise.
Almost everyone forgot their weariness at that moment. The dark sky was marked with a golden boundary at first. The climbers savoured that moment selfieing themselves in the backdrop of the rising sun. The path was soon teeming with the travellers selfieing, photographing and videoing the slow sunrise.
“I was feeling sleepy and tired, but now I am feeling fresh,” said a smiling Magiline. She made the pilgrimage with her granddaughter. The time read 6.20 in the morning of December 25, the day after the Unduwap Poya.
Magiline was one of the old, but not worn out, ladies who took steps in a surprisingly energetic style. Most pilgrims had the determination to reach the peak somehow and pay homage to the rising sun.
Sarath, a 60-year-old government servant, made the pilgrimage after a lapse of seven years.
“If not for my determination, I would have never made it. I felt tired more than the last time. But I had a strong will to see the sacred footprint, worship God Saman’s abode and pay homage to sun. Physically I am exhausted, but mentally I am excited and elated. I am thinking of making this pilgrimage every year, if possible,” Sarath muttered between trembling lips.
Coldness is something you cannot miss here, but the climate was not freezing like it used to be during the past years. Is climate change slowly taking a toll on Sripada as well?
Commonly termed as Ira Sevaya – loosely translated into English as ‘homage to the sun’ – it is an age-old tradition linked with Sri Pada. Of course it is a unique experience when you get to experience the slow rise of sun at 4888 feet above sea level. That figure, 4888 feet, is no cakewalk. Climbing to the peak of Sripada means you take 5000 steps for about five hours. The duration depends basically on your climbing speed.
If you are a steady walker, you can reach the peak within two hours. A steady walk with lesser breaks (as much as possible), unless you are frail, is the best way to walk this tough journey. The slower your climb gets, the more tired you will get in the end.
Some travellers choose the off-season to climb the Sripada. But if you want a real pilgrim’s experience, you should make it during the season. The season exposes you to numerous hardships of the pilgrimage. The night climb often introduces you to a packed queue at the sunrise. The peak gets crowded with the pilgrims paying homage to the Buddha’s sacred footprint, God Saman and the sun.
Even at this day and age when technology is given such prominence, surprisingly the path that leads to Sripada has not made much progress. Is it simply in a bid to retain the age-old charm of tough journey or because no one in the authorities want to develop it? With ubiquitous steep steps, Sripada path looks quite the old world.
Sripada journey, though infrastructure has improved quite a lot now, is still arduous and the baggage makes the journey heavier. However it is not so for the pilgrims. Even if they feel honest, they would not dare say that. They fear the wrath of deities and consider it as a verbal misgiving if any such thing comes out of your mouth. Whatever said and done night trek is the most enduring as well as enjoyable journey. Especially in season, you wouldn’t be alone. Backtrekkers would keep the climbers’ spirits lifted by ‘hosannas’.
The pilgrims never climb the mount alone. They are always in groups which have a chief each. The group chief is normally handpicked from the elder generation. They always kept tabs on what came out of their lips. They entertained fears for divine forces that reigned over the territory.
Lieutenant Malcolm narrates an interesting story on beliefs of divine forces. During the British rule the monks in the vicinity of Sripada had a belief that no White could climb the mount without impediment. Malcolm wanted give the lie to this local Tutankhamun’s Curse attitude.
He started the journey at 11 at night. No rains stood in the way as they were warned. Lieutenant’s team stumbled upon many things including dilapidated army castles. It took four hours to climb one hill of the whole range. The climbers somehow reached the peak at eight the following morning.
They proved the monks wrong, and came the most celebrated event hot on the heels. They fired three gunshots to mark their victory. Still they did not seem to have any idea of islanders’ fame for sanctity and calmness. Malcolm was regretting that he could not bring the Union Jack to hoist in the territory. Such was the thought of invaders by then; Sripada was only a joyride, it was no spiritual voyage in the least.
But now things are different. A major portion of the pilgrims include westerners. They have a great respect for this holy mount. Sometimes their respect has greater heights than the locals. Whatever nationality they belonged to, the pilgrims were engulfed in utmost joy as they sighted the rising sun.
As the rising sun slowly turned into a giant fireball unbearable to the naked eye, the pilgrims turned back albeit with fresh hopes: the sun will rise again tomorrow.
