Low priority to harvest, ship Pulmoddai mineral sands now - EP Governor

 The shipping of processed mineral sands from Pulmoddai has low priority now leaving possibilities for untoward business deals, and losing valuable foreign earnings, Eastern Province Governor Austin Fernando said.
He made these views speaking at the first round of Trincomalee Consultation, held in Colombo, organized by the Pathfinder Association.
He also noted that, in Trincomalee, the port area development had been appallingly slow.The road for investments is wide open and fresh interventions are required for Trincomalee, which has been identified by Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe who has initiated action to develop same.
“Trincomalee has one of the largest natural harbours in the world that has vast development potential.Since the handing over by the British in 1957, it is underutilised. It needs modernising as destabilization in the East due to terrorism prevented modernization.
“It is now limited to wheat milling, cement production, petroleum product development, minor fishery development and tourist service delivery. “There is expectation of joint development of balance oil tank farm with Indians, which if executed may make a visible impact in the Trincomalee business environment.”
According to the governor, any exercise to make Trincomalee the Hub of the Indian Ocean will not cease with maritime activity, but also bring prosperity to the hinterland.
The governor further added the investors can commit with confidence due to the stable law and order status and the enthusiasm of the government for regional development. The law and order organizations have brought overall normalcy.
