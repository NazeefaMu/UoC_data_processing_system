Lankan taste

Calamander Unawatuna Beach threw its annual New Year's party, to the fabulous sounds of the band Legato, a Queen of the Night catwalk, and raffle draw.
The celebrations included a fine spread of Sri Lankan and International cuisine, fireworks and more dancing with our hotel guests partying late into the night.
