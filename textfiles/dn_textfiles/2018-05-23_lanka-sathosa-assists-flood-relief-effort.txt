Lanka Sathosa assists flood relief effort

The Lanka Sathosa network has commenced delivery of dry rations to the government distribution centres in all flood-affected areas.
“We are catering to the needs of all flood victims totalling more than 36,000, and if this number increases, we are also ready to increase deliveries. We are preparing to airlift stocks if roads are flooded,” said Industry and Commerce Minister Rishad Bathiudeen yesterday.
Minister Bathiudeen was in a briefing with his officials on flood relief efforts by Lanka Sathosa.
Lanka Sathosa Chairman Rizwan Hameem said that the Lanka Sathosa network is carrying out relief work through divisional secretariats in flood-hit areas.
“The stocks in the entire network are being boosted to meet emergency requirements. Outlet managers began updating their dry ration stocks from yesterday.”
“We are not delivering dry rations directly to the victims, but to all DS offices based on the quantities ordered, even large, on credit. The DS offices will be making the payments later on. We have already increased warehouse capacities in affected areas such as Ratnapura.”
“We are making arrangements with the Disaster Management Ministry to airlift dry rations to our outlets if land transport is blocked by floods,” he said. Lanka Sathosa, under the Industry and Commerce Ministry, is the largest state-owned retail network and also functions as the price setter of many essential items for the retail market.
