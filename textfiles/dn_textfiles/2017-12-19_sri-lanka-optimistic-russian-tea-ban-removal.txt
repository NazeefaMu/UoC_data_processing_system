Sri Lanka optimistic of Russian tea ban removal

Sri Lanka is optimistic that the Ceylon Tea ban will be lifted by the Russian Federation, said the Commerce Minister Rishad Bathiudeen recently.
“I am optimistic of a quick solution,” said the Minister after urgent consultations with his top officials on December 17 .
“Russia and Sri Lanka have long-standing friendly and cordial relations. This ban is not a refusal of Sri Lanka by Russia, but only a temporary stoppage of one export product from us.
The only reason for our concern is that nearly 80 percent of our exports to Russia is Ceylon Tea.
We praise President Maithripala Sirisena for his prompt action in contacting the highest levels of the Russian government to resolve this. I am optimistic of a quick solution,” said Minister Bathiudeen.
Last year Russia ranked as the second largest buyer of all types of Ceylon Teas (including green tea made in Sri Lanka) at $ 143 million, the leading buyer in 2016 was Iran, at $ 154.10 million.
However, in 2015 Russia was the top most buyer of Ceylon Tea at $156.65 million, and the second leading buyer was Turkey.
According Minister Bathiudeen’s Department of Commerce, nearly 74 percent of Sri Lanka’s exports to Russia in 2016 was Ceylon Tea at a value of US $ 143 million (while total exports to Russia in the same year was $ 182 million). Over the years, total tea exports to Russia has shown a declining trend, with $ 240.32 million in 2013, $ 228.27 million in 2014, $ 156.65 million in 2015 and $ 142.55 million in 2016.
Ceylon Tea exports to Russia from January to August this year totalled US $ 114.18 million (83% of all types of Lankan exports to Russia from January to August 2017). Other main items that Sri Lanka exports to Russia are apparel, vegetable textile fibres, other clothing accessories (including gloves).
Sri Lanka’s total trade (both imports and exports) with the Russian Federation which was at US $ 435.83 million in 2015 declined to $ 381.71 million in 2016.
This year from January to August, it reported a total of US $ 260.78 million.
