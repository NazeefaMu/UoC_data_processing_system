Elkaduwa turns profitable again

Elkaduwa Plantations, which recorded losses for the past several years, had recorded a profit of Rs 34 million for 2017.
The company’s General Manager Roshantha Perera said this follows instructions given by Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe to transform the plantation into a profitable enterprise with private sector participation.
Elated by the turnaround made by the plantation company, the Prime Minister had directed them to accelerate development work.
Guidelines for the development of the concern had also been given to company chairman Nilu Wijedasa by State Enterprise and Kandy City Development Minister, Lakshman Kiriella.
