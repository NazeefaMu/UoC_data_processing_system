Brandix helps children under  ‘Ran Daru Thilina’ programme

More than 5,700 children received gifts of stationery, other school requisites and a school bag for the new school year under a new employee welfare initiative launched by Brandix, Sri Lanka’s top ranked exporter.
The ‘Ran Daru Thilina’ programme benefitted children from the nursery age to Grade 5, with each child receiving a pack containing items needed for his or her academic year.
The generous gesture encompassed the children of 4,969 Brandix associates employed at 24 manufacturing locations in Sri Lanka. Brandix also has a scholarship scheme titled ‘Ran Daru Scholarships’ under which financial assistance is extended to Grade 5 children of associates.
“Our associates are the life blood of the enterprise, and the wellbeing of their families is a fundamental consideration in all employee-related engagements at Brandix,” saidAnusha Alles, Head of CSR and Corporate Communications of the Brandix Group. “The cost of buying stationery and other supplies for school-going children can be a burden on many families. We are happy to be able to help alleviate that burden for a significant number.”
Among the items in each pack were exercise books, drawing books, colouring pencils, standard pencils, pencil sharpeners, erasers, bottles of glue and rulers. The packs of younger children also included modelling clay, scissors and crayons.
The beneficiary families are scattered across the country, in areas as far flung as Batticaloa, Giritale, Polonnaruwa, Nivithigala, Koggala, Rambukkana, Kahawatte and Pannala to name a few.
A similar programme has also been implemented by Brandix Apparel India, which is located within the Brandix India Apparel City in Andhra Pradesh.
