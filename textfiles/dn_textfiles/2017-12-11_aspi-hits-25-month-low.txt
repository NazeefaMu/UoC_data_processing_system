Point of view
Equity markets hit a 21/2 month low in the 1st week of trading in December, reflecting lackluster sentiment ahead of the holiday season and amid ongoing concerns over political and policy uncertainty.
After holding on staunchly above the 6400-level for ~three weeks, markets dropped below this level to skirt around the higher-end of 6350 levels.
The broad-share ASPI dropped a total of 36.6 points this week, despite positive macro-economic news that the IMF approved its 3rd tranche of the EFF program with Sri Lanka.
The IMF approved the $251.4Mn disbursement citing the fact that since the 2nd program review, Sri Lanka’s performance under the IMF-supported program has remained broadly on track with macroeconomic and financial conditions remaining stable (despite weather-related supply shocks) and as the authorities remain committed to the economic reforms under the program. Despite this development, retail investors remained largely on the side-lines.
HNI and Institutional investors however, returned relatively strongly to the market, accounting for ~46% of total market turnover, up from last week’s 31%.
Interest was driven mainly by a broad range of mid-cap stocks, but the majority of interest stemmed from LION, NEST, LLUB and NTB which cumulatively accounted for 58% of total crossings for the week.
The higher HNI/Institutional interest helped push up daily average turnover level back upto Rs.0.93Bn from last week’s Rs.045Bn and closer to the YTD average of Rs.0.94Bn.
Foreign investors meanwhile returned to the Bourse as net buyers (Rs.167.8Mn) this week, after two consecutive weeks of remaining net sellers (cumulative net sales of Rs.1,355Mn).
Markets in the week ahead are likely to remain largely subdued ahead of the year-end holiday.
Flat performance in Sept’17 corporate earnings
Corporate earnings for the total market1 remained flat over the Sept’17 quarter, falling a marginal 0.2% Y-o-Y to Rs.60.0Bn relative to the Rs.60.2Bn recorded in Sept’16.
Declines in sectors such as Finance (-17%), Manufacturing (-22%), Construction (-230%), Telco (-5%), Hotels (-59%), Motors (-40%) and Power & Energy (-66%) overshadowed gains in Banks (+6%), Insurance & Other (+12%), Diversified (+61%), F&B(+3%), Land & Property (+1%) and Healthcare (+53%).
Cumulative earnings2 for the 6-Months to Sept’17 meanwhile, rose 5.7% Y-o-Y to Rs.112.6Bn (cf Rs. 106.5Bn in Sept’16). The Y-o-Y gain is relatively flat compared to the comparable periods in 2016 and 2015, when cumulative 6M earnings rose 12.3% and 13.5% respectively.
Market earnings over the cumulative period was driven primarily by growth in the three main contributing sectors to corporate earnings; Banks, Diversified and F&B.
The gains in these sectors helped offset declines in sectors such as Manufacturing, Telco, Construction and Healthcare.
In terms of trailing 12M earnings meanwhile, corporate earnings rose 15% Y-o-Y to Rs. 264Bn (cf. Rs. 231Bn in the previous period) helped mainly by Banks, Finance & Insurance (+19%), Diversified (+47%), Construction (+15%) and Healthcare (+16%). The growth in earnings helped push the market PER down to 11.3x compared to 13.6x a year ago.
Sri Lanka’s PER level of 11.3x remains one of the lowest among its regional peers in Frontier and Emerging markets which currently trade between 14.5x to 15.4x.
