Three star hotel facility, a must at Sooriyawewa - SLC president

A three star hotel facility at the Mahinda Rajapaksa International Cricket Stadium in Sooriyawewa is a must to make best use of the
facility was the opinion of Sri Lanka Cricket president Thilanga Sumathipala when he addressed members of the Matara District Cricket Association last Sunday.
“The MRICS was built in Meegahajandura eight kilometers from the Sooriyawewa town and is an elephant infested territory. Elephants have been breaking down the protective fence regularly and causing damage. We can’t blame the pachyderms as it was originally their grazing ground,” said Sumathipala.
“The MRICS is not a popular venue as there is no suitable accommodation for the teams close by and obtaining quality meals is a problem. Hence, Sri Lanka Cricket hopes to invest in at least a three star hotel facility at Meegahajandura to popularize the venue. Until such time SLC hopes to rent out a suitable premise in Hambantota which can accommodate both teams and also provide a bus to transport the teams to and fro,” he said.
It is likely that MRICS may be a venue for the forthcoming Zimbabwe tour to Sri Lanka.
Speaking further Sumathipala said, “SLC has to incur a cost of Rs 600,000 to Rs 700,000 each month to merely maintain the cricket ground. At present the MRICS is understaffed after the Sri Lanka Army contingent that was detailed to maintain the facility was reduced. The air conditioning system needs alteration as the whole complex is centrally air conditioned. If all goes well the MRICS will not be a burden on the coffers of Sri Lanka Cricket in three or four years time,” he said.
