SLC election may be postponed

Sports Ministry secretary Jayantha Wijeratne has sought legal advice from the Attorney-General’s department regarding the validity of holding the Sri Lanka Cricket elections on May 19 on the advice of acting Sports Minister Faiser Mustapha.
Sri Lanka Cricket announced last week that the elections would be held on May 19 but certain factions have raised objections that the date was not decided at an Extraordinary General Meeting with the approval of SLC members as required by the Sports Law.
