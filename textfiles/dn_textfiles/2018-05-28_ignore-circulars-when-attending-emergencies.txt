President tells officials
Ignore circulars when attending to emergencies

Government circulars should not be considered an obstacle for public officials when they reach out to help and assist people affected by the recent floods and other inclement weather conditions, President Maithripalaa Sirisena said.
The President emphasised this at a meeting he presided at the Mahawewa Divisional Secretariat during an inspection tour of flood relief activities in the Chilaw area on May 26 afternoon.

The President who advised public officials to continue with the welfare activities launched for the benefit of affected families asked them to pursue rescue operations systematically with the assistance of the Armed Forces.
The President who said relief activities were undertaken in two stages, added that the government would act in a very responsible manner to provide relief during the calamity, as well as to provide welfare activities during the post disaster period.
The President also directed officials to launch a special relief programme to assist government pensioners and the lower rungs of government servants affected by the disaster situation.
At this meeting, people in the area explained the damage caused to their livelihoods during the disaster and requested that they be given easy financial credit to rebuild their livelihoods.
President Sirisena who gave a patient hearing to the woes expressed by the people directed the relevant officials to submit a report containing information about the matters raised.
The President who highly appreciated the mission undertaken by Public Officials and the Security Forces to provide relief to the affected expressed his deepest sympathies regarding the death of a Police Constable engaged in the humanitarian mission of saving flood affected people.
The President also directed officials to take urgent steps to cater to the welfare of the family of the Police Constable concerned.
The President later inspected the Medagoda bridge which had subsided with the floods and said steps would be taken to rebuild the bridge.
