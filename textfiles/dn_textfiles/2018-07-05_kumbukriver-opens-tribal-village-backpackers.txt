KumbukRiver opens tribal village  for backpackers

Sri Lanka’s internationally most-acclaimed resort KumbukRiver has added an expansion to welcome backpackers, too.
The new backpackers’ lodge adjacent to the Koh-pi Ka-deh or the Jungle Coffee Shop is a response to numerous demands to make KumbukRiver’s uniquely authentic experience available to more people, especially, backpackers who throng the near-by tourist town of Ella and Yala National park.
The centerpiece of the little village is KumbukRiver’s own Jungle Coffee Shop inspired by the tea kiosk where villagers converge, almost as a ritual, for tea and camaraderie. KumbukRiver, famous around the world as one of the world’s most unusual hotels and best eco resorts, sees travelers from all corners who now enters the new tribal village first before being ushered to their own unique accommodation.
KumbukRiver attracts visitors from other countries thanks to the media coverage it gets.
“But that didn’t allow the globe-trotting backpackers a chance to experience one of the world’s most unique hideouts and we finally responded by creating not just two tribal-styled lodges but a Koh-pi Ka-deh and a Kolam Maduwa (village performance circle) to go with it”, said KumbukRiver’s Creator, Dinesh Watawana.
A conservation catalyst KumbukRiver offers a host of unique experiences which allows a rare glimpse into rural life, forgotten archaeological splendours and breathtaking wildlife in a locality on the northern-edge of Yala National Park.
KumbukRiver shot to fame with its huge Elephant-shaped villa and received the only Travel Oscar for Sri Lanka at the World Travel Awards in a world’s best category being named as the world’s leading eco-lodge in 2008. KumbukRiver is also among the world’s top 10 most unusual hotels and Asia’s most amazing hotels.
