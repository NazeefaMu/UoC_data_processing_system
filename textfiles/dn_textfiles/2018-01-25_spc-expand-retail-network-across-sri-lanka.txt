SPC to expand retail network across Sri Lanka

Health Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne has instructed State Pharmaceuticals Corporation (SPC) Chairman, Attorney-at-law Sarath Liyanage to expand the the SPC retail network, a spokesman said.
At the moment there are SPC 36 retail outlets in various parts in the country. Arrangements have been made to open new SPC retail outlets at Akkaraipattu, Moneragala, Peradeniya, Matale and Kegalle. New SPC retail outlets will be set up soon at all General Hospitals and Teaching Hospitals in the country.
Minister Senaratne has also instructed the SPC Chairman and officials to expand the SPC agents' network and sales outlet network. SPC purchases drugs locally for all state hospitals, he said.
In 2017, SPC had sold drugs worth Rs. 6,000 million and provided Rs. 191 million worth of eye lenses for state hospitals in order to offer them to the patients free of charge, he said.
Minister Senaratne revealed these facts during a recent meeting held at the Health Ministry with SPC staff, the spokesman said.
