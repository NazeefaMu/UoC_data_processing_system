Sumanthiran responds to Rajapakshe accusation that Constitutional Assembly is illegal

 
TNA parliamentarian M.A. Sumanthiran has responded to former Justice and Buddasasana Minister Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe’s accusations that the Constitutional Assembly process is illegal, saying Rajapakshe was one of the original proponents of the resolution to form a Constitutional Assembly.
“Former Minister Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe has taken up the position that the Constitutional Assembly process is illegal – I’d like to point out that he is one of the original proposers of the resolution that was placed before the Parliament on January 9, 2016, which proposed the setting up of this Constitutional Assembly,” the TNA parliamentarian said.
“He is actually one of the drafters of that resolution having proposed it to the Parliament. He has also been a member of the Steering Committee – which met 73 times and he has attended more than 50 times and participated fully in that process. He has even drafted certain portions of the Interim Report that was tabled before the Constitutional Assembly recently,” Sumanthiran said.
He said Rajapakshe was fully aware of this process and was satisfied that it was entirely constitutional and legal: “His opposition now arises only because he has been sacked from the Cabinet,” the TNA parliamentarian said.
He added, “He can’t say that he did not know of the implications of this – he holds two doctoral degrees and a President’s Counsel, he has been President of the Bar Association of Sri Lanka and at the time he was the Minister of Justice – such a person can’t now suddenly say the process is illegal, having participated fully and having himself proposed the mechanism.”
