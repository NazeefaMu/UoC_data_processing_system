Joy of the Joes

The Official Joes Stag organising committee on behalf of the Old Josephian Sports Club (OJSC) and the batch of 1998 of St Joseph’s College – Colombo, take pride in announcing that the official stag night of St Joseph’s College will be held at the College main grounds on March 2 at 7 pm.
The “Josephian Stag Night” is one of the most prominent social events of the Josephian calendar and brings together a host of distinguished old boys. It is an event celebrated in the best spirit and harmony, creating a very rare platform to rekindle the most cherished moments during school days.
The batch of 98 has joined hands with the OJSC with the objective of upgrading the event to be highlighted as one of the most important social events of the college.
'Marians' will provide entertainment throughout the night and the committee envisages a record crowd this year. A guest appearance will be made by Old Joe Anasly Malewana.
Invites are available at the OJSC and with respective batch representatives, batch presidents, the organising committee and at the entrance.
The Official Joes Stag promises to be a fun filled event which sustains the traditions of the school and sets the standard for generations to follow.
Participation of distinguished old boys such as Sri Lanka Cricket skipper Angelo Mathews and National Players Dimuth Karunarathne and Tissara Perera is expected.
