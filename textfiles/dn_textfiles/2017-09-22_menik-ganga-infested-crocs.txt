Menik ganga infested with crocs

Crocodiles have increased in alarming proportions at the Menik ganga in Kataragama and pose death threats to those who bathe and wash clothes at the Menik ganga.
The devotees who come to Kataragama bathe at the Menik ganga before they enter the Kataragama Maha Devalaya.
Residents urge the the Wildlife Department to relocate the crocodiles.
