‘NCM against Ranil taken up after two weeks’

The no confidence motion against former Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe was handed over on March 21 and it was taken up for the debate on April 4, which is two weeks after the date of handing over, but the no confidence motion (NCM) against current Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa was handed over on November 14 and the `vote’ was also held on November 14, 10 minutes after the motion was handed over. This very clearly shows how biased the Speaker is, doctors, medical students and their parents said.
There was no debate like the debate held for the no confidence motion presented against the former PM. No proper vote was taken, they said.
A no confidence motion was handed over against former Foreign Affairs Minister Ravi Karunanayake on August 3, 2017, but it was not taken up for the debate until he resigned from his post.
Another no confidence motion was handed over against former Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayake on March 24, 2016, and it was taken for the debate on June 9, 2016, which is after two-and-a-half months and not within two weeks or two minutes, they said.
A no confidence motion was handed over against the former Health Minister on August 24, 2017, but it has not been taken for the debate until now. “We see a very clear act of discrimination and bias here.”
“We are not fools and we do not forget history in two weeks’ time as stated by LTTE Leader Prabhakaran,” they said.
