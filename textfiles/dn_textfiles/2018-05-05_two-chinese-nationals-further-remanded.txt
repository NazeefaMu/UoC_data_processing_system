Two Chinese nationals further remanded

Lakshani Samarkoon
Colombo Fort Magistrate Lanka Jayaratne yesterday ordered to further remand two Chinese nationals until May 9 on charges under Immigrants and Emigrants Act.
The Magistrate refused to grant bail to the suspects and ordered President’s Counsel Jayantha Weerasinghe appearing for the suspects to submit the relevant documents including documents of their residences.
The suspects had allegedly kept passports of eight other persons in their possession. They were also charged for preparing forged documents to stay in Sri Lanka.
The FCID initiated the investigation following a complaint made by the Director of Central Bank Intelligence Unit for depositing over Rs 950 million in a private bank in Sri Lanka.
They had come to Sri Lanka for employment but had engaged in an illicit gem business.
However, the Magistrate granted bail on the earlier hearing day to the two Chinese National as they pleaded guilty of those counts and ordered the FCID to file charges against the suspects. The Magistrate also banned the suspects from leaving the country.
The Magistrate yesterday allowed the FCID to record a statement from another Chinese suspect who had involved in the same illegal transaction that comes under Prevention of Money Laundering Act No 5 of 2006.
However, on the previous hearing day the suspects were again ordered to be remanded since they were unable to fulfill their bail conditions. They failed to furnish the documents. They were also allegedly kept passports of eight other persons in their possession and were charged for preparing forged documents to stay in Sri Lanka under Immigrants and Emigrants Act.
