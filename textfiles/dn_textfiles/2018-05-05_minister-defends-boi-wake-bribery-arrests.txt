Minister defends BOI in wake of bribery arrests

Development Strategies and International Trade Minister Malik Samarawickrama said he did not believe the recent arrests of senior government officials for soliciting bribes would affect foreign investment.
“Naturally, we are concerned about these things happening,” he said at the ministry offices in the World Trade Centre.
“(But) as far as the Board of Investment is concerned, we don’t have that issue,” Minister Samarawickrama added.
The Bribery Commission arrested President’s Chief of Staff I.H.K. Mahanama and State Timber Corporation Chairman P. Dissanayake on Thursday night for accepting a bribe of Rs.20 million from an Indian businessman. They were suspended by President Maithripala Sirisena last morning. The bribe appeared to be related to the deal to revive the now-defunct Kantalai Sugar Factory.
“Though the BOI was involved in the beginning of the project in 2015, Minister Samarawickrama said it had not been involved since the deal had been tied up in arbitration following a dispute over land allocation.
He said the Bribery Commission’s investigation was a sign of good governance.
“Because of our transparency only that this is came out,” he said.
