Mustapha challenges UPFA MPs

 
Provincial Councils and Local Government Minister Faizer Mustapha presented a challenge to coffers of political parties in the SLFP-led United People's Freedom Alliance (UPFA), to contest the forthcoming Local Government election on their own and show that they could win a single local body.
"I challenge those political coffers in the UPPA who have been vocalizing their plans of an invention of making a new political force in the country, to do so by leaving their alliance with the Sri Lanka Freedom Party and show their political strength if they command any strength as such, by winning one local body," said Minister Mustapha.
He said in any case, if the the SLFP was split in two, the advantage goes to the United National Party.
He asked if these UPFA members wanted a UNP victory at the election.
"Former Presidents Chandrika Bandaranaika Kumaratunga and Mahinda Rajapaksa, they all emerged from the Sri Lanka Freedom Party and they love this party," he said.
"They will never let the SLFP down. They stand to protect it," he added.
