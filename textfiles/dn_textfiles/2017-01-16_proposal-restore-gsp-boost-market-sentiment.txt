Point of view
Shares edged up to an approx. 2-week high with the announcement of the European Commission’s proposal to remove significant import duties on Sri Lankan products and restore GSP Plus (Generalized Scheme of Preferences Plus) trade access to Europe’s export market.
The All-Share Price Index took a turn from its losing streak on Wednesday with the announcement, as it rose ~65 points W-o-W, helping wipe off some of last week’s ~75 point W-o-W loss and pushing above a key-support level of 6152 points.
Gains were led by MELS, SLT, CLC, JKH, LLUB, HHL and CTC which together contributed ~ 45 points to the Index.
The daily average turnover of the holiday shortened week consequently increased by 32% W-o-W to end at LKR 0.71Bn, ~16% higher than 2017 daily average turnover of LKR 0.61Bn and marginally lower than 2016’s full year daily average of LKR 0.73Bn.

Crossings over the week accounted for ~28% of total market turnover, amid strong interest in blue-chips such as LLUB (51% of crossings), JKH (15% of crossings) and NEST (13% of crossings).
Foreign flows into the Bourse meanwhile turned negative this week (LKR 0.73Bn ) bringing the total net outflows for the year to LKR 1.7 Bn.
Markets in the week ahead are likely to retain the current positive momentum.
Short-term bill rates rise, trade deficit narrows
T-Bill rates across all maturities rose yet again for the fourth consecutive week this week, with the sharpest increase recording in 3M Bill.
Rates on the 3M Bill rose by 19bps (cf. 6 bps last week) while rates on the 6M bill rose 10bps (cf. 16bps last week) and the 12M bill rose 9bps (cf.5bps last week) as CBSL continued to mop up the excess liquidity in the market .
Yields on the 91-day and 182-day bills have consequently increased 42bps and 50bps since October 2016 to date compared to the steep increase of ~230bps (91 Day) and ~290bps (182- day) since January 2016 to Oct 2016.
On the External front meanwhile, Sri Lanka’s trade deficit narrowed -12.0% Y-o-Y in Sep’16 with the increase in export earnings (5.7% Y-o-Y) for the second consecutive month coupled with decline in import earnings (-2.5% Y-o-Y).
Export earnings improved despite decline in earnings in apparel sector (highest contributor to export earnings (~43%) aided mainly by improved earnings from tea (8% Y-o-Y), rubber (15.3% Y-o-Y) & transport equipment (486% Y-o-Y).
Lower import expenditure was supported mainly by lower oil import bill (22.1% Y-o-Y), non food consumer goods (16.9% Y-o-Y) & lower importation of vehicles (51.9% Y-o-Y).
Service inflows meanwhile were driven primarily by earnings from Tourism (+3.6% Y-o-Y) although worker’s remittances declined 1.1% Y-o-Y.
The country’s B-o-P consequently recorded a surplus of USD 243.1mn between Jan-Sep 2016 (cf. deficit of USD 2,316.5mn in Jan-Sep’15) though gross official reserves declined marginally to 4.1 months of imports in Sep ‘16 from 4.2 months in Aug’16.
