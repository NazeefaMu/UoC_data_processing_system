House turned illicit brewery raided in Millawa

Alawwa police on Tuesday succeeded in raiding an illicit brewery run by a woman at a luxury house in Millawa in Kurunegala.
Police took distillery equipment, a lorry and 30 barrels of illicit liquor into custody. Police said that liquor had been produced using LP gas and police found ten gas cylinders and five gas burners in the house.
This illicit brewery had been in operation for over six months without the knowledge of the neighbours. Police have arrested two suspects who were involved in brewing illicit liquor.
