Avurudu thoughts

The Sun has been so pivotal to our ancient civilization that we still continue many of the practices that our ancestors engaged in, giving prominence to the life-giving Sun and Nature. Many of those practices and beliefs were intertwined with astrology. Hence, the transition of the Sun from Pisces (Meena) to Aries (Mesha) has become a major celebration in Sri Lanka over the centuries.
The Sinhala and Hindu New Year that dawns tomorrow is an opportunity to reaffirm our bonds with each other and with Nature itself. Avurudu, (the more popular vernacular term) is celebrated in many other Asian countries under different names. It is a joyous national event that brings all Sri Lankans, here and abroad, together.
Although primarily celebrated by Sinhala Buddhists and Tamil Hindus, Avurudu celebrations see the active participation of all communities and religious groups. Avurudu is the perfect time to shed all differences – ethnic, religious and political – and support endeavours to establish lasting peace in our island. Such ethnic and religious unity is the need of the hour, especially when certain chauvinist forces opposed to the peaceful co-existence of various communities are working overtime to re-ignite the flames of hatred. People have however rejected their overtly racist political campaigns.
Unity and peace will be key themes for the Sinhala and Hindu New Year. Peace should begin in our hearts and in our homes. This is the lesson that Avurudu teaches us. It is a time for forgetting all past disputes and for giving and forgiving. It is a time for re-engaging in cultural traditions that we have nearly forgotten. Avurudu makes us admire and cherish our age-old moral values that centred on the village-temple-school axis.
Avurudu is perhaps the only event that motivates the entire populace, from Point Pedro to Dondra Head, to sit down for a meal at the same time and begin work at the same time. Many Sri Lankans living abroad also follow these auspicious times. Avurudu teaches us the value of togetherness, respect, forgiveness, punctuality, peace and co-existence. These are timeless traditions that we have inherited from our forefathers, ones we should in turn perpetuate for posterity.
Avurudu is a time for renewing bonds within families and among relatives. It is not unusual or families and relatives to be at loggerheads over various matters, but there is no point in continuing such hatred. We should forget such animosities that give rise to hatred and radiate compassion instead. Engaging in religious observances during the “Nonagatha” (Literally “no auspicious times”) period brings religion closer to our lives which are veering alarmingly away from moral values.
The Avurudu tradition of worshipping our elders and seeking their blessings through the anointing of oil reminds us of the need to honour and care for our parents and elders at a time when they are neglected in many societies. Ganu Denu (transactions) goes beyond the literal monetary meaning of the concept of give and take – that sharing and caring should be an integral part of our lives.
One can dismiss auspicious times (Nekaths) and Avurudu traditions as archaic beliefs that do not belong in the modern digital era, but they are rituals that still bind our society together and give us time to take a short break from the ‘rat-race’ lifestyle. Not many modern families sit down for at least one meal every day instead of being glued to the TV. The screen has taken over from conversation. That is a result of commercialism taking over our lives at the expense of family bonds and traditions.
Commercialism has also crept into all national and religious festivals. Judging by newspaper and television advertisements, Avurudu has become a big shopping and entertainment season with its core values and message facing the danger of being swept aside in this torrent of commercialism. This should not be the case. We should see through the commercial veneer into the real purpose of national events such as Sinhala and Hindu New Year.
Every New Year ritual has a meaning and purpose. They prepare us for a fresh New Year filled with fresh resolutions. The main resolution that we should see through collectively as a nation is achieving reconciliation. This is a time to reflect collectively on why and where we have gone wrong during the past and on how we could put things right at this juncture. Avurudu is not only an ideal opportunity for peace and reconciliation at home and in the village, but also in the country as a whole.
The Nation has entered a decisive phase of seeking lasting peace and reconciliation following a brutal conflict. The lawmakers have been busy drafting a new Constitution that is likely to address the concerns of all communities and religious groups in the country. The Sinhala and Hindu New Year could be a unifying factor in creating a new Sri Lanka and a Sri Lankan identity. That is one New Year resolution that we should uphold and strive to turn into reality in the coming year.
