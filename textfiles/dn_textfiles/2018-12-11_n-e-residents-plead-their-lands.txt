N-E residents plead for their lands

 
Residents from several parts of the North and East including Keppavilu, Iranaitvu and Valikamam gathered before the Colombo Fort Railway station calling on President Maithripala Sirisena to take steps to return land now occupied by the armed forces to their owners before the end of the year.
Sasikala who hails from Keppavilu said the President made them a promise that he would return all lands held under the military back to the owners.
“Instead of efforts to hand over the lands to the owners, we have noticed construction activity in some of these places. Even families who were resettled there fear for their lives due to the heighted presence of the forces who continue to surround the villages,” Sasikala said.
Nearly 56 families are waiting to be resettled in Kepavilu. However, even the 35 families who were there have no sanitation facilities and 27 wells have been destroyed before the land was released to them. “Gravel has been bulldozed into the soil in the released land, so crops cannot grow,” she said. “There are no housing projects either for these people.”
Christopher from Mullikulam said that 1,650 acres were still occupied by the Navy and 216 families are waiting to be resettled. “These people are fisherfolk whose livelihood depends on fishing, but the only a half-kilometre road that leads to the sea has been cut off and a gate has been built with road blocks throughout,” he said.
Anne from Pallimunai said that there have been 32 hearings for a court case over the release of a 2.2 acre land which continues to be occupied by the Navy. “Twenty-two families are waiting to be resettled in these areas,” she said. “We were displaced in 1990 even before the war ended, but we are yet to have our lands back. Over the last few years, six members of the 22 families have died.”
Many more individuals and families from areas including Silwathurai where 36.5 acres of land are occupied by the Navy, from Pilakudiyirippu where 16 acres are to be returned, Iranathivu where even the land that was released is still being occupied by a Navy camp and Ashraf Nagar where 150 acres are still occupied by the Army, protested calling on the President to make good on his promise.
Residents of Paanama also called on the government to enact the Cabinet decision to release lands as there is still 1,200 acres to be released to owners.
The residents and families were gathered under the support of the National Fisheries Solidarity Movement which hosted an event at the Lakshman Kadirgamar Institute. At the event, an interim report on an international fact finding mission on the Port City was released. A final report is to be published at the end of December.
