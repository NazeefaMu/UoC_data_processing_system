Australian Migration Centre  partners CSSL for NITC

Australian Migration Centre has partner with Computer Society of Sri Lanka (CSSL) as one of its Annual Partners, where two parties will work collaboratively. Australian Migration Centre will also feature at CSSL’s National IT Conference-2018.
MOU was signed by Yasas V. Abeywickrama-CSSL President and Hemantha Punchihewa- Australian Migration Centre Senior Migration Consultant.
The 36th National Information Technology Conference (NITC-2018) themed ‘‘It changes everything” organized by Computer Society of Sri Lanka (CSSL) will be held from October 2 to 4 at Shangri-La Hotel, Colombo Sri Lanka.
‘‘We are able to advice about all visa categories to Australia. However, majority of our services are concentrated on skilled visas. Our Australian registered consultants are responsible for the advice they give and the visa lodgments they do on your behalf. They are bound by the CODE of CONDUCT of the MARA. Australian Migration Centre and the consultants will take you through the entire migration process until the visa is granted,” Hemantha Punchihewa, Australian Migration Centre, Senior Migration Consultant said.
Australian Migration Centre (AMC) is the largest migration service provider in Sri Lanka, handling the highest number of offshore skilled migration visa lodgments. It is mandatory that all migration advisers and consultants are registered with the migration agent’s registration authority (MARA), which is the governing body of migration professionals.
The MARA is consistently overlooking all migration agents’ activities and administered by the Department of Immigration and Boarder Petrol (DIBP). The core business of the AMC is facilitating migration, specializing in Australian PR migration services thereby assisting a vast number of families to successfully relocate to Australia on various types of visas.
The NITC organised annually by the CSSL, is the flagship Information Communication Technology (ICT) conference held in Sri Lanka since 1982, involving ICT professionals, academia, technology experts, policy makers, entrepreneurs and private and public sector key decision makers both locally and internationally.
The Computer Society of Sri Lanka (CSSL) was established in 1976 for the purpose of promoting Information and Communication Technology.
