Historic Trump Kim Summit Tuesday

Presidents Donald Trump of the United States and Kim Jong Un of the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea will meet on June 12 at Hotel Capella in Santosa Island, Singapore. This is a dramatic development considering that the two were trading accusations and threats only seven or eight months ago and were virtually on the brink of physical war. Both leaders were called mavericks and war-mongers. While President Trump was decried as a lunatic President Kim was identified as a “Recluse” in a not so complimentary way.
Now both are called pragmatic leaders who understand realpolitik better and are pursuing meaningful policies. How did this transformation take place? No politician could operate in a vacuum. He or she is influenced by the historical setting, the economic and cultural environment and many more factors. For example, the precarious nature of the North Korean economy and the decline in the US economy would have influenced both leaders to pursue peace instead of war. Most important also is public opinion both in the United States and the Korean peninsula.
US citizens were weary of wars fought on foreign soil which resulted in the death of so many US soldiers. South Koreans had elected President Moon who favoured peace with the North. They did not wish to see their motherland destroyed by war. This yearning for peace found resonance in the North.
Earlier President Trump cancelled the Summit but subsequently the Koreans have managed to convince him about their genuine interest and conciliatory approach, which changed his attitude. Kim sent one of his most senior intelligence officials- Kim Yong Chol to meet US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo for discussions. Both of them later met President Trump.
It is quite clear that Kim has been an astute diplomat who played his cards intelligently without revealing the Aces. He started the whole peace process with the offer of joint participation in some sports events in the Winter Olympics last December in South Korea, which gathered a momentum of its own.
It is also true that he has not compromised on principle so far and has achieved the goal of strategic nuclear capabilities he desired. This last factor would not have gone unnoticed in Washington.
However, one cannot be too optimistic about the outcome of the Summit though a general thaw in US-North Korean relations could be expected. There are powerful reactionary and militaristic forces in the US that are unhappy with the latest developments. One of the positive developments could be the need to reduce the presence of US troops stationed in South Korea and the lifting of sanctions on North Korea. That would result in an asymmetry in the comparative strength of US and rival (Chinese, Russian) troops in the Asia-Pacific region.
US vetoes UN resolution on Palestine
The United States voted against a resolution brought by Kuwait calling for the protection of Palestinian citizens. This is an open endorsement of the policy of genocide Israel is currently practicing in Gaza. Last Monday June 4th alone Israeli Defence Forces killed 59 unarmed Palestinians including a medical worker and injured hundreds in one of the bloodiest days. During the last few weeks the toll of those killed was 112. In addition there were 13,000 people wounded.
Jim Kavanagh writing in Counterpunch says that New York Times Editorial Board has defended Israel. It has said that “Israel has every right to defend its borders”, ignoring the fact that Palestinians are in their own land and Israel is the intruder who has barricaded the Gaza population.
Shmuel Rosner in an op-ed piece in the NYT says “Guarding the border [or whatever it is] was more important than avoiding killing.” Kavanagh also reveals that Knesset Member Avi Dichter has said that “If every man, woman and child in Gaza gathers at the gate … there is a bullet for every one of them. They can all be killed, no problem.”
According to the UN Committee on the Rights of the Child Israel is guilty of “continuous use of Palestinian children as human shields and informants”.
Meanwhile, Israel is considering the extension of illegal Jewish settlements in the Golan region. On the 50th anniversary of the victory of Israel in the Six-Day War in 1967 Israel Deputy Minister Michael Oren has said that “the Golan is an acceptable part of the character of Israel and we must develop the same”.
The tragedy of Palestine is the disunity of the Palestinians with certain sections colluding with Israel and the US for opportunist reasons and the subservience of some Arab countries before US imperialism.
This calls for an intensification and expansion of the international solidarity campaigns against Zionism and Israel’s genocidal and apartheid policies.
The cause of Palestine is the cause of humanity.
