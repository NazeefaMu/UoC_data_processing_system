Overcome problems by upholding UN values: Kariyawasam

It is by upholding values, such as pluralism, human rights, respect for diversity and the principle of working together, upon which the United Nations was founded, that we can overcome problems the world is faced with, Foreign Secretary Prasad Kariyawasam said.
“The United Nations exists and works for ‘We the People,’ said Kariyawasam addressing an event to mark the 72nd UN Day at the Colombo United Nations Compound.
He said the UN has been in the forefront in drawing attention to the greatest problems faced by mankind.
“It has helped lift populations across the world out of poverty. It has helped promote democracy, and make the world safer for children, women and the vulnerable. It has helped draw communities across the world closer and has helped build strong partnerships and forge greater ties,” he added.
Kariyawasam said Sri Lanka’s relationship with the United Nations at present is the strongest it has ever been and added that Sri Lanka’s formal relationship with the UN turns 62 this year.
Pointing out that the United Nations is made up of ‘We the People,’ Kariyawasam said even though some may believe that it is only world leaders who can make a difference, he firmly believes that each and every one of us, ‘We the People,’ can do much in our individual way.
“We can do a lot with determination to influence history, one step at a time by our everyday actions, by how we support a greener planet and blue ocean, through small decisions in our everyday lives, by embracing non-violence, by embracing dialogue over conflict, by promoting greater understanding among all, by recognizing the interconnected nature of all life and all things, by reaching out to other human beings who may seem different just because they speak a different language or have a different set of beliefs, but are ‘human’ and that ‘humanity’ unites all of us and by imparting values and principles to our children who are the most important people in our lives,” he said.
Kariyawasam added that he believes that none of us as individuals are too small, too insignificant, or too weak to change things for the better.
“If we are determined, we can make a positive impact. The United Nations must take the lead to create awareness among people and inspire people that we are ultimately one human family, and that we must work together for the benefit of all. We in the Government value the work of the United Nations in Sri Lanka,” he said.
