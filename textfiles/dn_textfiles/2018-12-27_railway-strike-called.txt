Railway strike called off

The railway strike scheduled from midnight yesterday was called off by the trade unions on a promise made by Transport Minister Arjuna Ranatunga to solve the issue relating to the railway salary anomalies within a month.
Train Controllers’ Association President M.L.S. Ariyaratne said Minister Ranatunga made this promise at a meeting with the trade union representatives at the ministry auditorium yesterday.
State Minister of Transport and Civil Aviation Ashok Abeysinghe, locomotive engineers, guards, station masters, controllers and railway supervision managers participated at this meeting.
“Considering the minister’s positive response, the trade union decided to temporarily call off the strike to facilitate the commuters during this festive season,” Ariyaratne told the Daily News.
