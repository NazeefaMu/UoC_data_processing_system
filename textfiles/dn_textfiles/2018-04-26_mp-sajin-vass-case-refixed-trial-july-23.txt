MP Sajin Vass case refixed for trial on July 23

The case filed against former Foreign Ministry Monitoring MP Sajin Vass Gunawardena for allegedly causing a sum of Rs. 883 million unlawful losses to Mihin Lanka Airlines while he functioned as the Chief Executive Officer of Mihin Lanka, was fixed for trial last Tuesday (24) by the Colombo Chief Magistrate’s Court.
The case was refixed for trial on July 23 by Additional Magistrate Thanuja Lakmali Jayatunga.
The Defence Counsel who appeared on behalf of former MP Sajin Vass, requested for a further date stating that he had not received the documents and that he was not prepared for such a trial.
Considering the above facts, the Additional Magistrate ordered the Bribery Commission to lookup for documents and submits a report to Court.
The Commission to Investigate Allegations of Bribery or Corruption had filed this case against the former MP under Section 70 of the Bribery Act.
