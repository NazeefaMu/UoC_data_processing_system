Friction between political authorities and public servants, unhealthy - President

Frictions between politicians and public officials are not healthy for the country’s progress. In the march towards prosperity, all must work unitedly and obligingly, President Maithripala Sirisena said.
There is no goodwill, understanding, and cooperation among various sections of public service. There is no unit, he said.
He was addressing a seminar for Southern Province public officials held under the theme ‘Role and Challenges of the Public Sector in Creating Poverty Free, Empowered Sri Lanka’ at the Weligama Urban Council auditorium, recently.
“In the implementation of policies and government programmes, there are conflicts among parties of the public sector,” he pointed out.
“However, our public officials are ready to shoulder responsibility and perform any duty for the people. Our government officials have worked honestly during difficult times and come out of tough situations.
“Public officials should not be blamed entirely for trivial slip-ups committed by some government officials. If we introduce proper development plans for the country, public officials will be ready to fulfill their objectives. We must work honestly and be determined to realize national goals. We have to develop our self-esteem and courage,” he said.
Mass media has a pronounced responsibility in the country’s journey towards economic, social and political prosperity, President Sirisena said.
“At present, our media, both electronic and print, have embarked on a destructive media culture. A majority of news coverage on almost all television channels try to draw a gloomy picture about the country. In their news bulletins, they try to imply that the country is completely destroyed. They carry negative information about the country and the people. The print media also follow suit. According to media operators, they occupy in harmful practices to improve their ratings,” the President said.
At a time the entire country is in an arduous march toward prosperity, the media has to encourage such worthy moves. They should not carry misleading information. Mass media should encourage the development moves of the country, he pointed out.
Dr Sunil Jayantha Navarathne, Southern Province Governor Dr. Hemakumara Nanayakkara and Chief Minister Shan Wijayalal de Silva also spoke.
