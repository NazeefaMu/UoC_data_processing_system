No difference from 1977 economic policy

JVP Parliamentarians yesterday charged that the Budget 2018 presented to Parliament by Finance Minister Mangala Samaraweera under the theme of “Blue-Green Budget; the Launch of Enterprise Sri Lanka” is only a continuation of the economic policy introduced in 1977.
The Government has applied an environment friendly and animal friendly paint to the budget proposals and calling it as a Blue-Green Budget to mislead the ordinary people, they said..
Addressing the media yesterday at the JVP Headquarters, MP Vijitha Herath said the total expected income of the Government for 2018 is Rs 2,260 billion and the total expenditure is Rs 4,455 billion. "So there is a gap of Rs 1,895 billion. The Government is attempting to fill the gap by imposing taxes, borrowing more debts and cutting down the reliefs given to the people," he said.
"The budget proposals proved that the Government has no vision on production based economic development," he said.
He charged that no information about Hambantota Port Development Project or the Mattala Airport Development Project has mentioned in this budget. "All these development projects are going on outside the budget," he said.
JVP MP Nalinda Jayatissa said the budget proposals presented by Finance Minister Mangala Samaraweera were very similar to the proposals made by former Finance Minister, Matara District Parliamentarian Ronnie de Mel before 40 years.
He charged that the budget proposals for 2018 are completely contradictory and said a sugar tax on sweetened beverages was imposed claiming it as a solution for diabetes. "At the same time, they have given a tax relief for beer," he said.
