CP farmers asked to use fertilisers low in phosphorous

The Agriculture Ministry has recommended that farmers in the Central Province use fertiliser with reduced levels of phosphorous for vegetables and other crops.
The ministry in a press release yesterday noted that at a meeting held on Thursday evening under the patronage of Minister Mahinda Amaraweera, experts in the field of fertiliser highlighted the issue of high phosphorous fertiliser.
They said the soil phosphorous content in the Central Province was high and thus, applying chemical fertiliser high in phosphorous caused damage to the soil fertility conditions and eventually made the soil unsuitable for cultivation.
The minister thus directed the Agriculture Department to prepare a long-term plan for the country on the use of fertiliser that is suited to the soil condition in the area.
