Controversies in 2015

N Srinivasan era ends

Ending the N Srinivasan era in Indian cricket, the Supreme Court ruled that the Tamil Nadu strongman could not stay on as Board of Control for Cricket in India president as long as he was the Chennai Super Kings owner.
The SC-appointed Lodha Commission then suspended CSK and Rajasthan Royals for two years from the IPL after their owners were found indulging in betting. A rattled BCCI replaced them with new teams based out of Pune and Rajkot for two years. Led by a new president, Shashank Manohar, the Board introduced a slew of reforms to check conflict of interest.
Yasir Shah, Kusal Perera flunk dope test

Not just athletics, even cricket faced a 'dope crisis' as Pakistan leg-spinner Yasir Shah and Sri Lanka's 'keeper-batsman Kusal Perera faced the prospect of a ban after testing positive for a prohibited substance. Shah flunked a dope test conducted in November during the ODIs against England, while Perera failed an out-of-competition test in October.

The end for Kevin Pietersen

In his bid to make a comeback to the England team, Kevin Pietersen even gave up a lucrative contract in the IPL. However, despite smashing an unbeaten 326 for Surrey, KP's hopes went up in smoke after his former teammate Andrew Strauss, now England team director, made it clear to him that 'trust issues' meant he couldn't play for the national team ever again.
Llong is wrong
The first-ever day-night Test between Australia and New Zealand was marred by controversy when third umpire Nigel Llong handed Nathan Llyon a reprieve despite the batsman clearly edging the ball.
Llong relied on hot-spot, which was inconclusive while the snickometer showed an edge. The decision altered the fortunes of the game.
Turf Wars
After South Africa amassed 438 in the fifth ODI at Wankhede, Team India director Ravi Shastri allegedly abused curator Sudhir Naik. Looking to stump SA in Tests, India laid out vicious turners. India won the series 3-0. But the euphoria was soured after the ICC deemed the Jamtha pitch poor.
Ishant's ugly side
During India's tour to Sri Lanka, pacer Ishant Sharma had a run-in with Lankan seamer Dhammika Prasad, both on the field and outside the hosts' dressing room. The pacer copped a one-Test ban.
Indo-Pak deadlock
Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) chairman Shaharyar Khan kept trying to revive cricketing relations with India, but it fell on deaf ears as the BCCI cited lack of government approval. His attempt to meet BCCI chief Shashank Manohar in Mumbai too was thwarted by the Shiv Sena who staged a protest. TNN
