Bairstow lets emotions run high in century celebrations

Jonny Bairstow let his emotions get the better of him when he completed his sixth Test century on his comeback from injury on the first day of the third and final Test against Sri Lanka at the SSC yesterday.
An ankle injury while playing football during a warm-up saw Bairstow miss the first two Tests of the series and lose his place as wicket-keeper to Ben Foakes.
Bairstow having recovered from the injury was included for the third Test but not as wicket-keeper but to fill in the problematic no. 3 batting spot for England.
The red-haired Yorkshireman obliged by scoring 110 off 186 balls to see England to a first day total of 312-7.
“I was obviously pleased with it. There’s only a few times you get to score a hundred for England, so it’s a special time to be out there in the middle,” said Bairstow at the end of the day.
“The emotion and hard work that has gone into getting back out on the field is massive. It’s the hard work you put in behind the scenes that no one sees. The sleeping on ice machines, the rehab you put in. It would have been quite easy to say ‘I’m not fit’. That injury potentially rules you out for 6-8 weeks. You potentially just say ‘I’m content being not fit for six weeks’.
“That’s the bit that means the most out there...the days when things aren’t going well, for your mates back home that make sure everything’s okay. You could quite easily take your bat home for whatever’s gone on but putting things in perspective and what have you over the last couple of weeks has been massive,” he said.
On making the number three position his own Bairstow said, “Long term who knows what’s going to happen. In the last year I think I’ve batted at 7, 6, 5, 4 and 3. Who knows what’s going to happen long term. I’m happy with my performance today. You look at
challenges along the way and you try and take them in a positive way. I’d like to think today’s innings was taken in that way.”
SANDAKAN DEFENDS WASTING OF DRS
Sri Lanka’s left-arm spinner Lakshan Sandakan defended his team’s exhausting the DRS as early as the 22nd over that left them without any reviews and cost them a few of England’s wickets later in the day.
“The DRS we take with the intention of making a breakthrough. Even if the reviews had not been exhausted we would have taken that at some other point. It was a collective decision and we cannot pinpoint fingers at anyone,” said Sandakan.
Sri Lanka could have dismissed Ben Stokes and Moeen Ali cheaply had they used the DRS wisely. Stokes survived lbw decisions at 0 and 26 to score 57 and Ali at 19 and 23 to be 23 not out by the close.
Sandakan playing his first match of the series said that he was pleased to contribute on a good SSC pitch.
“It’s unfortunate Akila (Dananjaya) had to miss out. Glad I was able to contribute. It is a good wicket. The ball turns. I feel that in a day or two it will help the bowlers more. So far it is even for all,” said Sandakan.
“The wicket was good for batting and they didn’t take too many risks. They played some good shots than reverse sweeps. It is easy for batsmen as the ball doesn’t turn too much. Coming back after an injury I thought Bairstow batted superbly,” he said.
Sandakan who was undergoing some technical changes to his bowling was forced to play in this Test because of the absence of Dananjaya who has gone to Brisbane to have his bowling action reassessed after it was reported.
“I had a small error in my bowling arm and Piyal Wijetunga the spin bowling coach and the head coach took some corrective measures to rectify it,” Sandakan said.
