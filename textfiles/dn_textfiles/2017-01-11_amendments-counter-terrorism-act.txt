Amendments to Counter Terrorism Act

The government has come up with several Amendments to the proposed ‘Counter Terrorism Act’ (CTA) that will replace the ‘Prevention of Terrorism Act’ (PTA).
These revisions come in the wake of serious concerns expressed at the original draft of CTA that it has retained the repressive powers of the PTA.
The proposed Amendments have been discussed at length at the Sectoral Oversight Committee on National Security which met at the Parliamentary Complex on Monday.
A Committee member told the Daily News yesterday that heated arguments erupted during the Committee meeting when the piece of legislation was taken up. He said the meeting ended with indecision on certain provisions of the CTA including that of giving access to a lawyer before the recording of first statement of a suspect.
However, the member said the draft CTA along with the proposed Amendments was to be presented for Cabinet approval yesterday.
He said the Oversight Committee would take up the Bill again during the next Parliamentary sittings week after the Cabinet decides on what amendments to be accommodated.
The member said there was contention during the Committee meeting on the part of the TNA and the JVP that the access to a lawyer must be provided for the suspect immediately after the arrest and if not the Police could extract statements forcefully from the suspect.
