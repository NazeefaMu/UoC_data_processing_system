Yala paddy cultivation in Anuradhapura in tatters

The Anuradhapura district received rains last few days but the region did not get adequate water to commence paddy cultivation for the Yala season.
Anuradhapura Assistant Agrarian Development Commissioner Asanka Somawansa said water in nearly 3,200 small tanks would be preserved for drinking. Farmer organizations say water of the major tanks are at a low level.
The Mahakandarawa, Abaya Wewa, Padaviya, Huruluwewa and Nachchaduwa tanks do not have adequate water, they lament.
Only 30 percent of the 78,000 hectares could be cultivated under the present conditions, Asanka said.
However, farmers now can purchase 50 kg of subsidized fertilizer at Rs. 500 from the 42 Agrarian Development Centres. The National Fertilizer Secretariat has made arrangements to provide adequate fertlizer to the Anuradhaprua District. But farmers are not showing much interest in buying fertlizer for the Yala cultivation, he said. Meanwhile, about 70,000 drought affected families in Anuradhapura undergo severe difficulties since they did not receive compensation with the subsequent restriction imposed on them with the circular issued by the Disaster Management Ministry.
In March, 131,000 drought affected families received dry food ration. But now, only 59,420 families are granted them.
