Now Parliament under PRECIFAC probe

 
The Presidential Commission investigating Fraud Corruption, Abuse of Power State Resources and Privileges (PRECIFAC) has launched a broad investigation into alleged mass scale acts of corruption, fraud and misuse of state assets which had occurred in Parliament in the past.
Reports said waste, corruption and fraud committed ran into millions which were beyond estimation. For instance, a finger print machine purchased for over Rs. 10 million had been discarded after limited use.
Reports said that the machine had been discarded because it went out of order after a short use. The procurement of this machine had been done between January 10, 2010 and January 10, 2015.
No interest had been shown to get it repaired although it was a vital machine to record the visitors to Parliament for security purposes as well.
There had also been various acts of corruption and fraud involving the repair of the MPs' housing complex at Madiwela, granting of foreign scholarships to high officials and the purchase of building material and vehicles.
It is reported that former parliamentarian Lal Kantha had complained about various acts of corruption and fraud but the complaint had gone unheeded without any investigations into it.
PRECIFAC secretary Lacille de Silva said the Commission had launched an investigation following several public complaints received by the Commission.
