Rooted in history

‘Sakkarang' (Hospitality) is one of the finest films produced by Cine Sarasavi and an extraordinary film by veteran Dr. Dharmasena Pathiraja. It is a film about a village and its villagers in the up-country during the 18th century.
The king, the ministers and chieftain i.e. traditionally called as nilames, the clergy, and the ordinary people of the village are all bonded with each other. The king and the clergy, the ministers, and the Kandyan chieftains are all honouring each other not as a rule of law, but in the rich culture they are born and bred.
The village of Malagammama is not a feudal society, because they are a disciplined and cultured social group who knows their place in the society. For example the village chief dancer and drummer (Sube) bows his head to the chieftain (Nilame) as he knows the position he holds in the social context. Sube (Bimal Jayakody portrays this character quite satisfactorily.) knows his place in society. As the chief of a social group of dancers and drummers Sube has mastered his craft! That’s not all. He has rituals of his profession plus he is a healer through his charms and also a physician with a capability. All in all Sube is a social figure with rich cultural roots. The Kandyan chieftains also admire his skills in these matters.
The film's opening sequences establishes this social phenomenon well! When they are coming after a ritual, the chief is in the forefront, like an ant line they walk in a row according to seniority. When they depart they say good bye to each other with a disciplined bow of the head.
Healthy society
So I wonder how the westerners define it as a feudal society. There is unity, integrity and disciplined cultural inter-relationships which is a basic feature of a healthy society. We don’t see any discrimination among them. It’s a well rooted cultural society.
The Dalada Maligawa (Temple of the Tooth Relic) has given each and every family of drummers and the dancers a plot of land to cultivate and to live in. It is only a bond. There is no individual land ownership but with advent of the British rule, things are taking a sudden turn in this social set up. Money is becoming the prime source of the buying and selling economy. In this social context Dr. Ananda Coomaraswamy, the eminent scholar and academic, mentioned about this social phenomenon in one of his greatest books 'Medival Sinhalese Art'. In the film 'Sakkarang' too, the same social conflict has arisen in a very well made film art work.
The cinema students must observe and refer to the film 'Sakkarang' as reference material. The film has a very artistic colour tone. Kudos to director Dr. Dharmasena Pathiraja and, of course, the director of photography, Donald Karunaratna. This is quite different from the artificial and glamarous colour tones used by North and South Indian films.
Compared to the Pathi’s earlier films like 'Ahas Gawwa', 'Bambaru Evith', 'Eya Den Loku Lamayek' and 'Soldadu Unnehe' ('Ponmani' the Tamil film made by him too should be included in the list) the vigour and forceful presentations are not present in the film 'Sakkarang'. Unlike in my youth, maturity with long years of studying Dr. Pathiraja's work, an analytical study of his film style needs to be done.
Apart from the technical points, Dr. Pathiraja’s film is a rare treat for the audience. There are only good films and bad films! as the saying goes. 'Sakkarang' is a film that makes you sit and admire the story unfolding on screen.
Rare opportunity
The social thinking in the films he has made so far is a live wire for an awakening among our film audience. It’s up to the film audiences to watch the movie with mind and heart. The film is made to fill the vacum of entertainment today what a rare opportunity it is indeed!
The culture, behaviour patterns, mannerism and, of course, a civilized society, which we can be proud of is portrayed in 'Sakkarang'. The Sri Lankan Sinhala Society is rooted on very rich cultural roots. We felt it when we saw the film 'Sakkarang'. Compared to western civilizations, it’s value did not depend on monetary gains! It was giving and getting which goes hand in hand with the Buddhist Principal.
'Sakkarang' is produced by H.D. Premasiri (for cine Sarasavi). It challenges the audience as well as the film maker’s style.
Will they be encouraged by the state or the ruling government to take steps to promote films of this nature will they turn a deaf ear to the matter Only time will tell.
Sakkarang re-reads history and re-thinks social strata. It tries to awaken the cultural roots of our heritage. Through Western eyes it is not visible, but if you analyse the whole social set - up; it’s a pride of a nation that is portrayed. It’s not a primitive society. It’s our ancestral society. It’s a complete social structure to honour each other and to obey to each other. They were rich in thinking. One who tries to ruin or tries to enagage in destructive activities may have unexpected consequences! Pathiraja always emphasizes this awakening in most of his films. Every society may change, but the cultural roots must prevail!
