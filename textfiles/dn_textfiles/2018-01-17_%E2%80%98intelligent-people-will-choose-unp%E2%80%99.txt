‘Intelligent people will choose UNP’

The intelligent people of this country will elect the UNP to power at the forthcoming local government elections and entrust it with the historic responsibility of developing villages and towns disregarding the false propaganda carried out by foolish and dishonest politicians, said the United University Lecturers Association in a press release issued yesterday.
The release said this false propaganda is carried out by politicians who wanted to cover up the serious acts of alleged fraud, corruption and abuse of power and state privileges committed during their period of rule.
The release signed by Association President Prof S W Cyril, Secretary Prof G P S M Gunaratne and National Organiser Prof M O A de Soysa further said people who published distorted ideas and views about Presidential, Parliamentary Provincial Council and Local Government elections were political misfits who displayed their ignorance about elections.
When you examine the political pedigree of those who claim that the country’s Prime Minister could be decided through the results of the local government elections held on February 10, their ignorance was clearly evidenced.
The prime aim of these people who are out on bail by courts following indictments made against them for alleged fraud and corruption during the Rajapaksa regime was to re-establish a dictatorial regime which could control the Judiciary, Police and the Public Service according to their whims and fancies by deceiving the people.
By making statements as if they have been awakened by a Rip Van Winkle sleep, they were only displaying their ignorance about the essence of consensus politics.
What was visible from such statements was that they were more interested in achieving their selfish political objectives rather than rebuilding the country.
The majority of people who gave their mandate at the January 8 and August 17, 2015 elections expected democratic governance, economic development and national reconciliation and their firm wish and resolve was that any party elected through their mandate had no right to move away from these objectives.
No one could exercise influence to deviate from those objectives. The mini-election would decide as to who should be entrusted with the development of villages and towns.
History proved that the UNP was the only party capable of developing the villages and towns and strengthening community life of the people, the release said.
