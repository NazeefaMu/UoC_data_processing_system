India panel proposes BCCI revamp after scandals

New Delhi, Monday: A panel appointed by India's Supreme Court on Monday proposed sweeping changes to the country's scandal-hit cricket board and said gambling should be made legal.The panel headed by former chief justice Rajendra Mal Lodha was appointed after a string of corruption scandals at the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI).
It also suggests legalising betting after a popular Twenty20 tournament run by the BCCI, the Indian Premier League (IPL), was rocked by allegations of corruption, match-fixing and crooked umpires.
Its report, seen by AFP, recommends barring politicians from the sport's governing body and introducing time limits on holding office.
Gambling is mostly illegal in India, but betting on cricket matches thrives through networks of underground bookies.
"As far as betting alone is concerned... it would serve both the game and economy if it were legalised," the report suggests, with several riders.
In July it suspended the Rajasthan Royals and Chennai Super Kings (CSK) teams, triggering the resignation of former BCCI chief Narayanaswami Srinivasan.
Lodha's panel was formed in January last year to recommend changes after the top court found two IPL franchise owners guilty of betting on the outcome of matches in 2013.
The panel exonerated IPL chief operating officer Sundar Raman, citing lack of evidence, after it was tasked to investigate match-fixing allegations against him.
