Army aids the underprivileged in Jaffna

Security Force Headquarters - Jaffna (SFHQ-J) launched several community-oriented projects in collaboration with the Daham Pahana programme.
They provided bicycles, coconut seedlings and artificial limbs during a ceremony held at the Illankai Venthan Art College in Jaffna, last Wednesday (13).
Under the programme, 100 bicycles, 2,000 coconut seedlings and four artificial limbs were distributed among the underprivileged.
Simultaneously, cornerstones were laid for the construction of two new houses for low-income families in Kayts on the same day.
Religious and community leaders, Daham Pahana Founder Rev. Bro. Charles Thomas, military personnel serving in Jaffna and residents of the area took part in the event.
