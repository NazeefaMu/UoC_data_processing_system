Union Bank supports over 700 flood-affected students

Union Bank’s Corporate Social Responsibility committee together with the Bank’s Southern and Sabaragamuwa regional offices and the Sports Club of the Bank extended a relief porgramme towards school children affected by the severe weather conditions that struck the island in May.
The relief project themed ‘Back to School’ was conducted in line with Union Bank’s key CSR focus of elevating the lives of children and youth.
With this project, the Bank reached out to over 700 school children in two schools in Ratnapura and Akuressa - two of the worst affected areas.
Two deserving schools were identified with the involvement of the Bank’s branches in these two areas where the floods have cost the communities their livelihoods and belongings|
Through Union Bank’s ‘Back to School’ initiative, the Bank intended to support and encourage these children to overcome their dire circumstances and return to school to resume their studies as early as possible.
In order to support the school children to resume their studies, a comprehensive pack of books and stationery items were provided along with school shoes to all children in the two selected schools.
Phase one of Union Bank’s ‘Back to School’ project was implemented at the Athuraliya Central College in Akuressa, one of the leading schools in the area, in which over 90% of children had been affected by the floods. The second phase of project was completed at R/Haldola Primary School in Ratnapura.
The two programmes which were coordinated with the assistance of the school principals and staff members were also attended by Union Bank’s staff including staff members of the regional offices and the respective branches. This CSR initiative of the Bank was also supported by the donations made by the Bank's staff.
Union Bank’s social responsibility reaches far beyond philanthropy and seeks to uplift and empower the children and youth in deserving communities. The Bank is committed to bring respite and hope to children and youth of the nation through its CSR strategy which places special focus on development, empowerment, education and social well-being of this key segment of the society.
