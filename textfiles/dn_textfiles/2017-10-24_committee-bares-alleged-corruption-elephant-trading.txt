Committee bares alleged corruption in elephant trading

The Committee to report on the allegations of corruption in issuing of licenses for elephants reported that Wildlife Conservation Department officials had allegedly engaged in corrupt transactions with businessmen in trading elephants between 2011 and 2014.
The Committee report had been handed over to the authorities on May 25, 2016 and reportedly no steps had been taken in that connection.
According to the report of the one-man Committee of retired Supreme Court Justice Nimal Edward Dissanayake, during the said period, Wildlife Conservation Department officials had allegedly maintained more than 100 fake files stating that the elephants had had died. “The report also stated that details of them had been erased and other details entered together with new photographs of other elephants pasted to make forged documents. There were around 50 such files”.
According to the report there were some forged documents without any details and the suspects should be dealt according to the law and indictments filed before the High Court.
The report also has that an elephant had been imported for the Dalada Maligawa from Myanmar in 2007 and a sum of Rs.261 million had been allegedly misappropriated by a person who was involved in the transaction.
The Committee also found that the actual value of this elephant was only around Rs.10 to Rs.15 million in the open market. It also recommended that the culprits be brought to book after conducting an investigation.
The one-man Committee was appointed by the Cabinet of Ministers under instructions of Sustainable Development and Wildlife Minister Gamini Jayawickrema Perera in 2015 to report on the allegations of corruption in the registration and issuing of licences for elephants and permits under CITES (the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora).
