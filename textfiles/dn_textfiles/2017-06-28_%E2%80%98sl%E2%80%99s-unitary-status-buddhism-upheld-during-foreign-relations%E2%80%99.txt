‘SL’s unitary status, Buddhism upheld during foreign relations’

Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayake said his ministry will maintain relations and dealings with the international community in a manner which will uphold the pre-eminent position given to the country’s unitary status and Buddhism in the Constitution, while protecting Sri Lanka's identity.
The Yahapalana government has been able to win over the international world by changing the country’s unfavourable international image during the last two years and former Foreign Minister Mangala Samaraweera had made a great stride in this direction, he said.
Minister Ravi Karunanayake stated this when he called on Most Ven Thibbotuwawe Sri Siddhartha Sumangala Mahanayake Thera of the Malwatte Chapter at his aramaya in Kandy and received his blessings.
The Malwatte prelate in his anusasana said skilled youthful officials should be selected to serve in the diplomatic service instead of retired persons. Some members of Sri Lanka's present diplomatic corps didn’t seem to be making any contribution towards rebuilding Sri Lanka’s image abroad.
He had pointed this out on several previous occasions too and previous governments had not taken any account about the matter. The prelate said even though the international world appreciated the Yahapalana Government, certain local groups could not see its values. Minister Karunanayake said three Sri Lankan diplomats who failed in their duties had been recalled recently after discussions with the President and the Prime Minister. The government would always make it a point to appoint capable and efficient individuals as ambassadors. He said at present, there were 63 Sri Lankan diplomats serving in foreign stations. He said diplomatic relations would be set up with several new countries shortly as trade and investment were much needed to steer the country forward. Later speaking to the media, Minister Karunanayake said former Foreign Minister Prof G L Peiris gave a series of written undertakings to the International Community on the instructions of former President Mahinda Rajapaksa. When the former government failed to abide by them, the International Community started placing obstacles to the country, he said.
