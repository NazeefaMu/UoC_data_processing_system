New subject on conflict transformation for higher education institutes

The Office for National Unity and Reconciliation (ONUR), chaired by former President Chandrika Kumaratunga, in partnership with University Grants Commission (UGC) has introduced a new subject on Conflict Transformation and Reconciliation.
The new initiative comes under the programme “National Unity and Reconciliation through Higher Education.
The MOU between the ONUR and the UGC was signed with the participation of senior officials of seven universities and higher educational institutes in Sri Lanka and Deans from all Social Science Faculties across the island.
The joint effort by the ONUR and the UGC to introduce a new curriculum module on conflict transformation and reconciliation through the University system is a significant step in medium to long term efforts on reconciliation by the government.
The objective of launching the programme in universities is to initiate a dialogue among university students belonging to different religious communities, leading to social cohesion and peaceful co-existence in the multi-religious and multi-ethnic society in the country.
The seven universities and higher education institutes for the first phase of the programme are University of Ruhuna, University of Jaffna, South Eastern University, Visual and Performing Arts University, Swami Vipulananda Institute of Eastern University, Sri Lanka Bikshu University and Jamiah Naleemiah Institute.
The implementation of the programme will be governed by a steering committee which is formulated with the participation of university representatives.
