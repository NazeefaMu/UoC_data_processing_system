Another Israeli massacre in Gaza

The tiny Mediterranean enclave Gaza – a 225 square metre strip of land with a population of more than 2million has never known peace. It has been under a tight blockade imposed by the aggressor state of Israel which forcibly occupies Palestinian land and constantly encroaches into the remaining Palestinian lands, building settlements, oppressing the people, practicing apartheid policies against the natives.
On March 30, the Land Day Palestinians demonstrated against illegal occupation of their lands beginning a sit-in-protest along the Israeli- Gaza border for six weeks till May 15. Men, women and Children- entire families joined in and all of them were unarmed. They were commemorating the killing of six unarmed Palestinians by Israeli Defence Forces 42 years ago in 1976.
Repeating the 1976 massacre Israeli forces which included over 100 snipers opened fire on the unarmed Palestinians killing 18 and wounding over 1,700 others.
Israeli government justified the shootings saying that the deceased were Hamas “terrorists”. Not only has Hamas not conducted any military operations there, but also, that all protestors were unarmed civilians. Gideon Levy commenting in the Haaretz newspaper has said “killing of Palestinians is accepted in Israel more lightly than killing of mosquitoes”.
The Western media, including the BBC also misreported the event saying that the deaths occurred during a clash between Palestinian protestors and Israeli soldiers. It was not a clash between two equally strong opponents. It was cold blooded murder by the aggressor against hapless people. (Such perverted interpretations are not infrequent among Sri Lankan media too!)
The demonstration was one of the largest seen in recent times and more than 30,000 people took part in it. It is named “Return of the March”.
Nepali Prime Minister visits India
Nepali Prime Minister Prasad Sharma Oli began an official visit to India yesterday (6). The visit is expected to improve relations between the two neighbours, which were somewhat strained for some time with Nepali politicians complaining about Indian interference. Nepal’s close relations with China had irked India.
Nepal has a stable government under a new democratic Constitution for the first time after the overthrow of the monarchy by an armed revolution during the latter part of the first decade of this Century. Oli Government has 88 percent confidence in Parliament according to a recent vote. The only significant political force outside the Government – Madhesis, is also having discussions to join it.
Relations between the two countries should be based on mutual respect and equality, according to Oli. It is necessary to “correct” and update many earlier signed treaties between the two countries, he told The Hindu in an interview. He cited the instance of the 1950 Treaty which was signed by the Prime Minister of India and the Indian Ambassador, the signatures alone showing the lack of respect.
Nepal also wants Indian projects to be completed expeditiously. For example, the Pancheswar and Makhali Project is still not completed after 22 years. Allaying Indian apprehensions that Nepal is getting too close to China, Prime Minister Oli said “We want neighbours to develop and prosper so that we can sleep without worry”. He added: “We are careful and mindful of all sensibilities of our neighbours. But we will not enter into their competitive tournament”.
The World in 2050
The world economy could more than double in size by 2050, far outstripping population growth, due to continued technology-driven productivity improvements, according to a research report published by Pricewatercoopers last year.
In 2050 the 10 leading economies would be China, India, the United States, Indonesia, Brazil, Russia, Mexico, Japan, Germany and the United Kingdom. From 2016 to 2015 Vietnam would move up 12 places from 32 to 20 in the world economy while Philippines would go up from 28 to 19 and Nigeria from 22 to 14.
Vietnam, India and Bangladesh will have the fastest economic growth rate of approximately 5 percent during 2016 – 50. In the African continent Nigeria will be the fastest with an annual growth rate of 4.2 percent.
The share of the world GDP of China will grow from 18 to 20 percent from 2016 to 2050.
During the same period India’s share will grow from 7 to 15 percent while that of the United States would decrease from 20 to 16 percent, of the European Union from 15 to 9 percent.
Thus by 2050 the Emerging Nations would replace the G7.
