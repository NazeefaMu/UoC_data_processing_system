Proving expensive equipment and fine golf courses not essentials:
Killinochchi Academy wins inaugural Inter-Academy Novices Golf Title

Killinochchi Academy emerged winners of the inaugural SLGU Inter-Academy Novices Golf Tournament conducted by the Sri Lanka Golf Union (SLGU) at the Eagles Heritage Golf Club in Anuradhapura recently. By winning the inaugural title Killinochchi Academy provided true testimony to the facts that one does not need to have expensive equipment and well maintained golf courses to start golf and the golfing talent in Sri Lanka is just waiting to be discovered and nurtured.
Twenty three junior golfers took to the field to compete in the inaugural SLGU Inter-Academy Novices Golf Tournament as part of SLGU's program led by its President Priath Fernando to unite the country through golf. The tournament was possible after the 'HSBC Future Lions' program initiated in conjunction with HSBC in September, 2017 by moving to the next phase of testing the competitive skills of kids who had never before played in a tournament.
The first phase was to train and certify Level 2 instructors using the services of Anil Perera, a Class A Professional, PGTCA USA. These instructors were then used to train the potential kids who were selected after the initial talent spotting 'HSBC Future Lions' program. Whilst, the Colombo and Welisara kids practiced at the Navy Aqua Range in Welisara, the Anuradhapura kids practiced at the SLAF Eagles Heritage Golf Course in Anuradhapura. The least facilitated group of kids, the Killinochchi Academy could only use their school grounds to sharpen their skills.
Commenting on the programme, Mark Prothero – Chief Executive Officer: HSBC Sri Lanka and Maldives said: The HSBC Future Lions Junior Golf grass root programme attracted over 300 children in its inaugural year. We are hugely encouraged with its outcome and our congratulations to the junior golfers from Killinochi on their victory at this inaugural event. HSBC as a global supporter of the game is delighted to support SLGU in its endeavor to engage more junior golfers and provide an opportunity for players from across Sri Lanka to experience the sport and more importantly enjoy it. We look forward to the HSBC Future Lions programme in 2018 .
Up to a maximum of eight kids from ages 12 to 17 from each Academy were hand-picked by the instructors to represent their Golf Academies after training just 1-2 hours per week over a five month period. The results were better than expected with some kids making pars and one even making a birdie with the best score of 50 for 9 holes by the overall individual winner, Thanuja Kalhara from Anuradhapura. Priya Hemantha, head instructor of Kilinochchi was awarded as the Best Instructor for producing the winning team.
“If I had to point out to one thing apart from the golf swing, it would be the enthusiasm and focus from these players” said Anil Perera, Golf Development Consultant of the Sri Lanka Golf Union.
Whilst there were no corporate sponsors for this event, the cost has been met by donations through a fund raiser organized by Sri Lanka’s top golf professionals called 'Pros give back', in appreciation for the support that they were given by the SLGU to become top amateurs before they turned professional.
