HNB named as one of Sri Lanka’s most valuable brands

Strong financial performance as well as a relentless focus on customers and innovation, have paid off, with HNB being ranked as one of the country’s top 10 most valuable brands by the global, Brand Finance.
Significantly, HNB has sustained this ranking for 15 consecutive years. According to Brand Finance, over the last year, HNB’s brand value rose 19.2% to Rs. 22.2 billion, reflecting the strong connect that brand HNB has with its business performance.
Accordingly, HNB’s brand performance upped 10.3% over 2017, showing that their single-minded focus on growth by strengthening the brand has paid off. Jonathan Alles, Managing Director and Chief Executive of HNB said, “As Sri Lanka’s largest private sector bank, we are honoured to be recognized as Sri Lanka’s most valuable brand. Over the years, we have been committed to shaping the future of banking, embracing digital and embedding ourselves in the customer journey. Being recognized as one of the Country’s top 10 brands spurs us on to making banking simple, smart and effortless for our customers."
“The significant growth in our brand value is a testament to the strides the bank has made. In recent years, we have delivered strong earnings growth and are today the largest private sector bank. With our beginnings and roots in the plantation industry of then Ceylon, HNB is privileged to have played a key role in Sri Lanka’s growth story”, said Alles.
“We believe the time is now and Sri Lanka is poised to scale up as a financial centre. At HNB, we will continue to strengthen our brand as we help shape the future of banking in our Country."
