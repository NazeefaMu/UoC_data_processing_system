‘Presidential Commission of Inquiry reinforced COPE report’

The recommendations and conclusions given by the Committee on Public Enterprises (COPE) on the bond issue have been reinforced by the latest report of the Presidential Commission of Inquiry, COPE Chairman and JVP MP Sunil Handunnetti said.
Speaking to the Daily News yesterday, he pointed out that it is the responsibility of the government to proceed with legal action against offenders without further delay.
Urging the government to fully implement the recommendations of the report, the MP said the COPE findings show that the Perpetual Treasuries Limited has earned an undue profit and the leaking of inside information of the Central Bank have been reinforced by the Bond Commission.
“Both the COPE and PCoI have strongly recommended punishing the offenders and recovering the loss to the government from those responsible.
Now is the time the government should show its commitment to the pledge to fight against corruption and uphold good governance,” he said.
