Tea production up

Tea production has increased after it was severely affected due to adverse weather conditions early this year
According to Forbes and Walkers Tea market review last week’s overall quantity on offer recorded an increase and totalled a 6.2M/kgs. Low Growns (large leaf teas) continued to witness good demand whilst high and medium (small leaf teas) encountered a weak market.
