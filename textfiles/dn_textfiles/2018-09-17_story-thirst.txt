Story of thirst

In 1967, John Berryman was in Ireland with his wife and child, on a Guggenheim Fellowship. He had won a Pulitzer Prize for the first volume of The Dream Songs, those incantatory stanzas about Henry and Mr Bones, all dialect and scholarship, saturated in drink – “I have a sing to shay”.
A journalist from Life magazine met the poet in Dublin and wrote an eight-page profile under the headline “Whiskey and Ink”: “These are the fluids John Berryman needs. He needs them to survive and describe the thing that sets him apart from other men and even from other poets: his uncommonly, almost maddeningly penetrating awareness of the fact of human mortality”. Later that year Berryman was to be found vomiting blood at the Chelsea Hotel in New York. The second volume of The Dream Songs came out in 1968.
In 2016, in the New Yorker, the poet and critic Henri Cole wrote of The Dream Songs:
Some readers have wondered if these uncomfortable poems were the result of alcoholism, or of double doses of chlorpromazine (an antipsychotic) or Dilantin (an anticonvulsant), which had both been prescribed to Berryman.
But I do not really care, since beneath the gruff surface and the high jinks of these poems we hear, deeper down, a vibrant, loving man with a vast spirit. Exacerbated and enormously learned, Berryman was a master of the poem written with manic energy from the edges of human experience . . .
Manic energy
What catches in that passage? Is it the “vibrant, loving man with a vast spirit”? Is it an image of centripetal “manic energy”? Or is it the “But I do not really care”?
It would be uncool, priggish, unthinking to care too much about the artist’s intoxication. Torments require relief and expression: numbing and utterance; alcohol and art. You can’t unpick the work from the circumstances of its creation, nor should you want to. In 1975, the critic Lewis Hyde tried caring about Berryman.
A few years after the poet’s death, Hyde published an essay, an angry blast against the romanticization of the inebriated artist. When Hyde read The Dream Songs he didn’t hear the genius so much as “the booze talking”. “Its tone is a moan that doesn’t revolve.” Hyde seemed to believe – unfashionably – that Berryman’s work would have been better had he been sober.
In The Recovering, Leslie Jamison returns to this myth of whiskey and ink, as a writer, an academic and an alcoholic. When, a few years sober herself, Jamison read Hyde on Berryman, she “whispered a secret ‘Amen’”. She wanted “to believe that giving up booze didn’t mean giving up electricity, and Hyde was suggesting that the fruits of alcoholic composition weren’t glorious but deeply compromised”.
Jamison grew up in a high-achieving family in Los Angeles (dinner was conducted once a week in French; love felt to her like “reaching”). Her mother was a nutritionist, her father was never around, and then her parents separated. Jamison went to Harvard, then the University of Iowa; she taught and travelled, wrote a novel, The Gin Closet (2010), and a book of essays, The Empathy Exams (2014). Now, she directs the non-fiction programme at Columbia University. A constant throughout all this is a sense of lack and a corresponding need. But her set-up here is like a strange jigsaw, in which the size and shape of the hole changes while she is rummaging around for the missing piece.
Unromantic portraits
In romantic portraits of the artist – like unromantic portraits of the addict – we tend to picture a lone figure, longing for someone or something else to fill them, but they keep coming unstuck against an inability to feel sated or reach perfection. They swear off the humdrum, the community, the other pieces that might fit; they work alone. It is impossible for them, or anyone around them, to discover what they really need – they are absorbed in the process of becoming themselves, rather than simply being.
Part of Jamison’s own recovery involves her identification of what she needs: a story “to get sober in”; she needs to know “if stories about getting better could ever be as compelling as stories about falling apart”. And her own story about falling apart is, in moments, crackling and bright. Her shame, which is a concept best relayed – in a synaesthesia slip – through smell, rises stinking from the page. Alcoholics Anonymous helps her, because, “in many ways, AA was all about embracing need: resisting self-sufficiency, seeking humility, granting help and receiving it”.
As she carries us through this story of thirst, Jamison also considers the lives and works of many drunk and high artists – among them Berryman, John Cheever and Jean Rhys. - Times Literary Supplement
