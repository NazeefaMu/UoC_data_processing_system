Professionals want open debate  on FTA with Singapore

A group of seven professional bodies urged the government to present the FTA agreement between Singapore and Sri Lanka to parliament for an open debate and get professionals engaged continuously in discussions with regard to other proposed trade agreements.
Representatives of the Institute of Engineers Sri Lanka (IESL), Sri Lanka Institute of Architects (SLIA), Institution of Incorporated Engineers Sri Lanka (IIESL), Institute of Quantity Surveyors Sri Lanka (IQSSL), Institute of Town Planners Sri Lanka (ITPSL), Institute of Landscape Architects and Institution of Surveys (ILAIS) told a press conference, concerns raised by professionals previously are yet to be taken into consideration.
The president of the Sri Lanka Institute of Architects (SLIA) Archt. D.H. Wijewardene said the professional bodies were not against the agreement, yet the manner in which the agreement has been formulated was a great concern.
He also stressed that it’s important that respective professional bodies should be consulted prior to entering such agreement. He also noted that, while Singapore is well developed to accommodate such trade agreement, Sri Lanka lacks the required advancement.
The President of Institute of Engineers Sri Lanka Engineer Prof. Niranjanie Ratnayake also expressed her concern regarding the same. She said there are several technical aspects to be considered in this agreement which the WTO abides by and that Singapore too has abided accordingly with significant professional input, but the same has not been applied in Sri Lanka. At the few discussions that took place between the Ministry of Development Strategies and International Trade ( MoDSIT) and the Professional Bodies, it was insisted that until and unless the domestic mechanisms are in place and the professional organizations are strengthened to face the challenges of ensuring prevention of low quality foreign professionals practicing here and taking up the jobs that should be filled by local professionals, and ensuring that new employment opportunities are created for the local professionals, FTAs liberalizing service sector should not be implemented.
The Professionals also insisted that a National Trade Policy must be published with input from the stakeholders and specific cases must be presented for bilateral trade agreements showcasing how they would benefit the country and its people.
They claimed in July 2016, assurances were given by the Minister in writing that the legal framework will be in place prior to signing any FTA but actions have been extremely slow while negotiations on FTAs has proceeded independently.
The few actions taken by the Government to have a trade policy, streamline the immigration laws, strengthen professional institutions etc. has been a very slow process and they are all at the initial stages. Establishment of a human capital authority to figure out human resources requirements which is a prime requirement did not see the light of the day.
Sri Lanka and Singapore signed the FTA on January 23 which is liberalizing key services sectors.
SLSFTA has come into force on May 1, 2018 after an exchange of letters between the two parties confirming that the necessary apparatuses are in place on both sides.
