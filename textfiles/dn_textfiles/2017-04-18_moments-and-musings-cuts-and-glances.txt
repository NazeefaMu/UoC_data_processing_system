Moments and musings, cuts and glances

This article was written based on the book “Australian Cricket Anecdotes” by Gideon Haig’s, I hope the readers will bear with the strong words used at times which is typical of the Aussies.
The book states as follows, “More gruesome fun was had at the expense of the Sri Lankans, whom Australia met in their next World Cup match in 1975. When Anura Tennakoon’s team showed unexpected resistance, Chappell gave Jeff Thomson carte blanche to retard their progress.”
Anyway I hit this bloke Mendis (Duleep) on the head. They are only little fellas so you couldn’t call it a bouncer exactly. He fell down face first, and when they brought him around, his captain was saying: “you’ll be right or something or other”.
But Mendis just says: ‘Oh my God I am going’. He went and he was not coming back! They took him to hospital.
But the real trouble came when I hit Wettimuny on the foot. He was waltzing around and he wanted to go too. That was enough for him. I’d already hit him in the chest. As I walked past him at the end of the over I said to him: “Look it’s not broken you weak bastard”. I said: “I’ll give you the tip------if you are down the next over it will be!”
His captain gives him the pep talk, you know, “stick around, I’ll look after you” sort of caper. Then the captain obligingly just blocked out Dennis to make sure he wasn’t going to get down to my end!
So this poor bastard was facing me again, and the ball landed in exactly the same spot and whacked him straight on the instep.You should have seen him---jumping around he was.
This is where the plot went to action. The ball had come straight back up the pitch to me, and as I collected it, the boys are yelling out ‘Throw down the stumps’, ‘two up throw down the stumps!’
I am saying ‘No, no, no, I can’t do that, no’—all in a split second. Then I thought ‘bugger it!’ and threw the ball and knocked the stumps over. I jumped up and shouted an appeal, but no other bastard’s moved. They all sat or stood there with their arms folded! They had done me stone cold on purpose. Tommo (Frith) pp 56-7.
An Unusual Congregation
Chappell’s Australians were renowned for their pranks, Doug Walters frequently their instigator. Journalist Peter McFarline recalled this one from the night after Australia beat Pakistan in the opening match of the 1975 World Cup.
One fast bowler over indulged a trifle in his favorite drink and was kindly led to bed, non-compos mentis, by some team mates.
This did not miss the attention of Mr. Walters who was attending a party given by some local people. He promised them early morning fun, somehow found a lectern and a bible and set them up at the scene of the party.
In a super human effort, he half coaxed, half carried the inebriated fast bowler clad only in his pyjama bottoms to the party and demanded he read from the bible. Halfway through the amazing performance the bowler’s only piece of clothing slipped quietly to the floor to the amusement of the congregation. Our fast bowler, stumbled on, blissfully unaware of his nakedness. - Cricketer, February 1980 p18
Crying in the Chappell
Ian Chappell played his last first class cricket in 1979-80, disappearing with little fanfare but with an unequalled reputation as a taskmaster. South Australian apprentice seamer Ross McLellan had this rueful reminiscence of his first match for South Australia against the Englishmen in November 1979.
I had a really good game. I played under the captaincy of Ian Chappell, failed to take a wicket and dropped Geoff Boycott. That was like dropping Jesus while playing under God.
The Australians by and large are friendly type of people but when it comes to sport, they have this win at any cost attitude. Although the country is large, and their numbers are small still they have produced fantastic sportsmen and women. They are superbly fit as well, and as Asanka Gurusinha has so rightly said our cricketers need to be fit and 100% fit first and foremost.
It would be handy to inculcate the “go getter” attitude to our young cricketers from early days. Gone are the days when we had to be submissive to the “White Sahibs” and the time has come to show them who the masters are. The road to recovery is long, hard and bumpy but a determined effort by the people up above could see the light at the end of the tunnel.
