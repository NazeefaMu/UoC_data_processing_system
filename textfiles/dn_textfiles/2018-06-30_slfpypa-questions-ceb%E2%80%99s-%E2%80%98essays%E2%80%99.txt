SLFPYPA questions CEB’s ‘essays’

Sri Lanka Freedom Party Young Professional’s Association (SLFPYPA) vehemently condemned the process in which the Power and Renewable Energy Ministry recruited unskilled electricians.
SLFPYPA Executive Member Rajika Kodithuwakku said the recruits were asked to write essays about the success of United National Party(UNP) and about the Ceylon Electricity Board.
“And the letter stated that those essays had to be sent to the Power and Energy State Minister Ajith P. Perera. It further said that they will be recruited to the permanent cadre after four years of training and qualifications of these recruits were also not mentioned”, he said.
He requested President Maithripala Sirisena to look into it and to make sure that similar recruitments don’t happen in the future.
Kodithuwakku said former President Mahinda Rajapaksa can be arrested for saying that he could bring down Udayanga Weerathunga.
He said that former president could be arrested for not revealing information about a fugitive on whom a warrant had been issued and added that the police can inquire from him to get to know about Weerathunga’s whereabouts.
He said that sometimes law is not equal to everyone referring to MP Mahinda Rajapaksa not being inquired and Gotabhaya Rajapaksa’s case not being heard in courts.
Kodithuwakku speaking about the recent New York Times article over allegations against former President Rajapaksa he said Rajapaksa has to give a clear explanation to people on that matter.
“If he could get media attention to speak about every other thing why not clarify on this issue”, he questioned.
