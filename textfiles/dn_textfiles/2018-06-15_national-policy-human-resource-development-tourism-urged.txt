National policy for human resource development in tourism urged

‘With new investments coming to the hotel sector amounting to USD 2.8 billion the industry will require thousands of newly trained workers in the next couple of years,’ said Minister of Tourism Development and Christian Religious Affairs, John Amaratunga said.
The Minister made these views speaking at the 39th Graduation Ceremony of the Sri Lanka Institute of Tourism and Hotel Management which was held at the BMICH .“Needless to say these investments have put a lot of pressure on SLITHM to deliver thousands of new workers at craft, supervisory and management levels. I’m happy to note that SLITHM has risen to the challenge by producing the required numbers,” he said.
Meanwhile Sri Lanka Institute of Tourism and Hotel Management (SLITHM) Director General Buddhika Hewawasam emphasised the need for a national policy on human resource development in the tourism sector.
This is to develop the much needed tourism related human resources to serve the demanding tourism sector of Sri Lanka.
Noting that there is an ongoing need for long –term national strategies and policies covering human resources development in the tourism sector, Hewawasam said the shortage of well trained tourism personnel coupled with high rate of turnover continued to be a major issue for the tourism and hospitality industry with the situation worsening with many new hotels, coming up in the country and absorbing the existing experienced personnel.
He expressed these sentiments, speaking at the 39th graduation ceremony of Sri Lanka Institute of Tourism and Hotel Management (SLITHM), held at BMICH.
“The country requires at least 400,000 employees by 2020 if we are to serve two and a half million tourists.” Sri Lankan tourism is also committing to achieve five million tourists by 2025. To this end, hotel schools have to be improved and capacities will have to be increased.”
To cater to growing demand for high quality human resources in the tourism industry, SLITHM is currently bringing out close to 7,000 trained personnel per year.
“Apart from this, the existing private colleges in tourism also bring out s trained personnel although one cannot be sure about the quality of this training.”
A professionally efficient workforce is essential to provide the level of services expected by the international tourists, However, Hewawasam highlighted four major constraints, that are still found in human resources development such as the shortage of qualified human resources, gaps in the availability of tourism training infrastructure, qualified trainers and teachers and the lack of attention given to the conditions of work in the tourism sector.
