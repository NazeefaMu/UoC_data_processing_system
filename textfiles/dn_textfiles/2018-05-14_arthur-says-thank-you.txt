Arthur says thank you

Dear Readers and animal lovers, I would like to say a big thank you from the bottom of my heart to everyone who responded to my appeal so readily and came to my rescue. As you would recall I was hit by a four-wheel and left to die in a ditch. For four -five days I lay there in agony until I was rescued.
My rescuer who looks after many animals like me found it a bit difficult to meet all my medical expenses so she put out an appeal. I am truly amazed at all the kind people who so readily came to my rescue. Thank you all you wonderful people; Simon, Divya, Tari, Dharshi, Mrs Gopallawa, Deb, Nishka , Irushi, Manique, Devika, Piyum, Yajna, Roshi, Anjana, Angela, Ann, Anthony, Ayoni, Mr Balasooriye, Chandani, Chandrishan, Dammikka, Dhanusha, Dilshani, Dinesh, Gayandri, Kanthi, Mrs Wanigatunge, Mrs Wijesundere, Nelun, Sena, Susil, and of course Tamara who first saw my plight and alerted people to come rescue me. Also Dr Kodituwakku and Dr Asanka who healed me and Kasun and aunty Manoja who took me up and down to the vets
for x-rays and dressing of my wounds, etc.
I hope I have not forgotten anyone and if I have, please forgive me. Mylove and heartfelt thanks go out to all these wonderful people who gave me a second chance in life. I can hobble along on three legs now and I am with Tamara who first spotted me when I got knocked down.
One last message to everyone from me; whenever you see any animal on the road, please avoid us. Woof, woof, lick lick, undying love to all of you. Any further news on my progress could be got from Anusha 0777585998.
Love, Arthur
