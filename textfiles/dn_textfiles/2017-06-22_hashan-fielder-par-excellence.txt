HASHAN fielder par excellence

He can best be described as a once in a lifetime cricketer. He was brilliant where ever on the field be it wicket keeping, slip fielding, fielding in the outfield or close in almost kissing distance to the batsman and the era when Sri Lanka’s cricket was beginning to be a threat and make other countries playing cricket take notice. HASHAN PRASANTHA TILLEKERATNE falls into that rare breed.
A brilliant fielder is important and essential, than a brilliant batsman or a bowler. My coaches at St. Benedict’s College, Edward Kelaart and Bertie Wijesinha used to lay special emphasis and stress on us how important it is to have a brilliant fielder in the team. Given the option these coaches would always plonk for a brilliant fielder. The importance of this need not be reiterated. How many coaches will believe in this aspect today?
From the time he took to the game at D.S. Senanayake College, the College that gave the famous Aravinda de Silva to the game, TILLEKERATNE showed his natural instincts, or god given instincts as an excellent fielder and what an eye-catching display he showed to the world with his marvelous fielding. Today there is no better sight than seeing a brilliant fielder at work.
Tillekeratne an all in one
With TILLEKERATNE in the team, it had a 14-member attack force. In addition to his determined left hand batting, he was fielder, wicket keeper and also bowler. Any coach, captain, team or country will love and yearn to have a all in one an like the irrepressible TILLEKERATNE. Today no country could boast of a gem of a cricketer like TILLEKERATNE. Why coaches don’t stress on their youngsters to emulate the deeds of players like TILLEKERATNE is inexplicable.
The writer was privy to witness TILLEKRATNE’S feats in the game. And there is one particular incident that was unique and rare and not likely to be repeated. The writer was in the company of that storehouse of knowledge and who has one of the best cricket libraries in the world--Walter Asoka Atapattu in Wellington, New Zealand watching that Test and the incident was this.
In a Test match in Wellington against New Zealand, Captain Martin Crowe who is sadly no more, was on the way to a milestone becoming the first Kiwi to score a triple hundred. He batted brilliantly to stall Sri Lanka’s victory push and was on 299 when to call it a cricking miracle would not be wrong was witnessed.
Signed, Sealed and delivered
With the game, signed, sealed and delivered as a draw and only the triple hundred, if it happened to savor, Crowe sliced a ball in the slip region and wended his way to the pavilion not bothering to look back certain that it was going to take him to the dream figure of 300. TILLEKERATNE keeping wickets dived goalie like to almost second slip to gobble the catch and Crowe turning back hoping to see the ball reach the boundary stood dumb stuck as TILLEKERATNE gloved the ball off a innocuous Arjuna Ranatunga delivery. That catch is still etched in my memory.
TILLEKERATNE was rubber like. He would stretch, dive and lunge and he was fearless and excelled, especially fielding close to the batsman and several were the bat pad catches he clung on which were unbelievable. He was yards better than India’s Eknath Solkar in this position. In a Test match against New Zealand at the SSC in the 1990/91 series he plucked seven catches that equaled the world record.
On Solkar and to recall a sad incident. Maharaja Organisation who were the Maharajas in the Mercantile cricket scene when Mercantile cricket was the showpiece of the game at that time were touring India taking part in the Moin-ud-Dowlah tournament in Hyderabad.
 
 
Hamer the irrepressible
Russel Hamer the irrepressible Wesley College and Maharaja left handed batting ace and wicket keeper who played for the country and who made the switch hit famous, played one such stroke that caught Solkar unawares flush on the face and he left the field bleeding, never again to field in that famous position of his for his country. I was privy to that incident covering that tour for the ‘Times Group of Newspapers’. That Maharaja team had a local boy Gehan Mendis scoring heavily in country cricket playing for Tony Greig’s county team Sussex and who Greig was convinced should play for England. But that was not to be. That was the era when snobs ran English cricket.
Like Sanath Jayasuriya who used to feast on bowlers hitting sixes with gay abandon – 217- in all formats of the game, TILLEKERATNE used to gobble catches, mostly fielding in his pet position close to the batsmen and believe it or not taking 211 catches. A record to savor.
After a successful run at D.S. Senanayake College where he served notice of his immense talent scoring heavily, he joined the Nondescripts Cricket Club where he was fortunate to come under the expert guidance of former Benedictine and wicket keeper batsman Ranjit Fernando and my team mate who donned wicket keeping gloves for the country taking over from Asia’s best wicket keeper batsman at that time H.I.K. Fernando and excelling as an opening batsman. Fernando polished the little flaws that TILLEKERATNE had in his game and the end product as his career progressed- a CHAMPION - in the big league for the country.
Resolve and resilience
TILLEKERATNE too like all good cricketers who suffer a glitch has experienced his hills and valleys when he had the ignominy of being dropped for poor form. But with grit, resolve ad resilience, he cocked a snook at his detractors and came back to do his bit for game and country which is history now.
As a 19-year old he got his first break called up to don pads against England ’B’ at Galle and made that game the rock on which he built his career with a three-figure score that saved the team’s blushes and made the selectors take note of his future in Sri Lanka cricket. He later achieved the dream of any sportsman and that is to captain the country. He realized that dream. Lack of space permits me from singing more of his praises. But his records briefed below says it all. He was a cricketer any captain would have yearned to have in the team.
Having said that now to his other attributes.
