Student’s housing dream comes true

The housing dream of a student of Polonnaruwa Royal College became a reality with the mediation of President Maithripala Sirisena on Saturday.
The President had advised the relevant officials to complete the construction of the student’s house in line with the Pibidemu Polonnaruwa District Development Project.
Accordingly, the officers had taken measures to complete the construction of the house, which had been partly completed in the Gannangolla area near the Parakrama Samudraya, promptly.
The President, who participated in commissioning the playground of Polonnaruwa Royal College constructed after the “Pibidemu Polonnaruwa” District Development Project meeting on August 2,2018 was highly taken up by the speech made by by Grade 9 student Shalika Lakshan on the occasion. The President while appreciating the student’s talent came to know that Lakshan was having difficulties in completing the construction of his house. On an invitation of the student, President Sirisena visited the house and saw for himself the difficult situation the student and his family members were undergoing. The President then took the necessary measures to complete the construction of the house promptly. Lakshan’s was opened with the participation of the President on Saturday after conducting religious observances.
