Funeral coach carrying coffin falls into canal

A funeral coach which traveled from one of the funeral parlors to deliver a coffin to a funeral house with the remains of a dead woman, had reportedly veered off the road and fallen in to a canal after the driver of the coach was knocked out by the husband of the late woman.
According to the police media sources, the relatives of a woman, who had passed away in the teaching hospital in Anuradhapura had given her remains to one of the funeral parlors in Galenbidunuwewa area to do the embalming and make final arrangements. The funeral parlors had arranged a coach to deliver the coffin of the late woman.
However, it was reported that her weeping husband also had got in to the front seat of the funeral coach and traveled in it. After half and hours drive, the husband of the late woman reportedly had a dispute with the funeral coach driver and had knocked him out when the coach was moving at a considerable amount of speed.
This resulted in the funeral coach going off the road and falling in to a canal after the driver lost control of it due to the unexpected incident. It was revealed that the husband of the late woman who is a permanent resident in Galenbidunuwewa area in Kekirawa, was completely under the influence of alcohol at the time of incident.
When this was reported to the funeral parlors, they had come to the place and with the help of the neighborhood they had taken the coffin out of the fallen coach and arranged another funeral coach to deliver it to the funeral house.
Further investigations related to the incident are been carried out by the police.
