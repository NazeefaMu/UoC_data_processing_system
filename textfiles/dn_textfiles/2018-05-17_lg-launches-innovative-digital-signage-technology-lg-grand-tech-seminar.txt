LG LAUNCHES INNOVATIVE DIGITAL SIGNAGE  TECHNOLOGY AT LG GRAND TECH SEMINAR

For the first time ever in Sri Lanka, LG released the progressive new lineup of digital signage solutions on May 16, 2018.
The launch took place at the LG Grand Tech Seminar, Cinnamon Grand, which saw a gathering of more than 250 invitees from different genres of the local business community including IT, hospitality, retail, transportation, media and more. The event showcased live demos of the several categories of digital signage technology that LG has to offer.
Digital Signage, described as an electronic display platform, has gained major popularity over the past decade due to its ability to build brand awareness, serve as an effective springboard for advertising, and deliver integral information about a company’s products and services through high-quality graphics and videos. With their new cutting-edge range, LG will be breathing new life into this advertising medium and bring the future of digital signage to Sri Lanka. The brand aims to revolutionize and enhance how local businesses communicate with their consumer base.
One of the many such solutions demonstrated at the LG Grand Tech Seminar was OLED Displays. Like their namesake OLED TVs, the incredibly lightweight and slim OLED Displays boast features which reproduce pure blacks with no light bleed that provide infinite contrast, and render immensely vivid visuals for more awe-inspiring picture quality.
Clients also have the opportunity to develop a large interactive video wall with LG’s 55-inch LED screens. Incorporating a narrow bezel, LED screens enable the overall video wall image to resemble a single complete display that will enthrall consumers. Plus, the solution enhances the relationship between the customer and the business by allowing the customers to directly interact with the video wall. This aspect can be easily customized by clients according to their business needs.
Further, commanding a passing customer’s attention is the best way to increase the footfall at any store. The LG Ultra Stretch Digital Signage achieves that and does a whole lot more. Producing immersive UHD visuals in a breathtaking 3840 x 600 format, this ultra-wide widescreen signage deeply enriches the consumer in-store experience by offering dynamism in advertising, branding and interactive graphic interfaces.
Another innovative digital signage technology that wowed invitees at the event was the LED Transparent Film. Incorporating LED diodes in a transparent film which can fitted over store front windows, this solution presents a unique approach towards providing businesses a competitive edge by offering eye-catching digital content and information.
Other digital signage solutions under the LG’s latest range include the System-on-Chips which can execute several tasks at the same time, guarantee smooth content playback, and produce unique advertisement layouts, while the Touch Screen Displays are equipped with no ghosting technology that host a 10-point multi-touch experience and allow audiences to write, draw and express their ideas in a seamless manner.
Clients can also choose between the interactive Pro:Centric Smart and the Standard Peformance SM5KD series.
LG Digital Signage Solutions have been used in the hospitality sector across the world, enabling hotels to devise a five-star guest experience.
Hotels have reaped immense benefits from these solutions’ capability to provide digital navigation, room service menu boards and compelling advertising, which in turn creates an interactive, collaborative space where guests can comfortably work and seek entertainment.
Businesses, other than hotels, that choose to switch to LG Digital Signage as their advertising solution will also undergone a stark improvement in sales conversion, develop more positive relationships with their consumers and improve their overall brand image.
