Wesley finally strike it rich

 
Wesley College recorded a morale boosting 19 points (two goals and a try) to 10 (two tries) victory over St. Joseph's College in their inter-schools 'A' division league rugby tournament played at Longden Place yesterday.
The Wesleyites who attempted to draw first blood was not successful as their scrum half Avishka Lee missed a 22-metre penalty.
After that no team could score a point until the 37th minute when Lee made up for his earlier lapse by scoring an under the post try. Lee converted it by himself to give the Wesleyites a 7-0 lead at the breather.
In the ninth minute of the second half, Vinul Fernando scored the first try for the Darley Road School which went unconverted.
Five minutes later Oshan Dias scored the second try for Wesley by the left corner flag which was successfully converted by Lee to make it 14-5. Both teams had a thorough defence and tried hard to penetrate each other's defence. Wesley was successful again when Dilshan Vimukthi touched down in the 33rd minute. Lee failed with the conversion but Wesley by now had accumulated a 19-5 lead and was sitting comfortably.
A few minutes before the final whistle Devon Fernando scored an unconverted try for the Josephians but it was not enough to surpass the opponents total and Wesley ran out worthy winners.
