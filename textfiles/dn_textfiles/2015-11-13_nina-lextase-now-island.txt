Nina L'Extase now in the island

Nina Ricci stands by women through their "revolutions." Anticipating their desires, an instinctive and mysterious presence; an understanding feminine voice that makes each Nina Ricci woman an exceptional person revealed only to herself.
Every creation of Nina Ricci is an ode to femininity. Nina Ricci fragrances reach out, full of poetry, to the very core of a woman's sensuality. In every era, an aspiration and a dream are revealed.
The House of Nina Ricci introduced its first fragrance in 1948, a great classic and a spicy floral fragrance whose modernity and balance still surprises over half a century later.
Nina by Nina Ricci, a fruity floral fragrance introduced in 2006, explores the imagination of a young girl, balanced between fairy tales and first attraction. A quest for femininity that is as mischievous and as tempting as forbidden fruit. A woman in the making.
With this new perfume - L'Extase - Nina Ricci opens a new chapter, setting free a new feminine dream. A chapter that is both legitimate through its link to womanhood and bold through its expression.
With this new creation, Nina Ricci embraces the dream of a woman in tune with her most secret desires. A woman of her time, she asserts the right to experience pleasure with all her senses. The pleasure of being surprised, aroused and overwhelmed. Femininity filled with sensuality. To be herself - incandescent, free, determined - a woman's erotic dream an imaginary and carnal voyage to the core of her being, all the way to ecstasy.
Free and instinctive with an absolute sensuality, Laetitia Casta is the epitome of French chic. A figure, an appeal, a uniquely photogenic presence, with a face that is never as beautiful, whether in Fashion or on film, as when it is bare, without artifice. For this new Nina Ricci dream, she invites women to set free their desires, experience their pleasures and deliver themselves to ecstasy.
Memorable and with a clear identity, this first Francis Kurkdjian creation of Nina Ricci is evocative of a woman's desire. A carnal portrait - a flowering of the senses. Two accords, powerful and mysterious, chase and echo one another. Barely Rose is built around a bouquet of white petals, highlighted with natural roses and structured with pink peppercorns, like a satin caress. Then Musky Shadow is revealed, intoxicating and arousing, with notes of benzoic Siam and Virginia cedar subtly caught up in a breath of musk and amber. L'Extase, an incandescently modest Eau de Parfum with a genuinely erotic signature.
The bottle of L'Extase is modelled on a couture clutch, one of the House's iconic accessories. It is a mysterious glass envelope in shades of dark mauve, the gold detailing and delicate black satin ribbon with the signature plate all place L'Extase boldly in the line of the great Nina Ricci perfumes. The outer box wears a powdery pink texture, decorated with the signature plate and a black ribbon lined with gold. The black inside reveals the promise of L'Extase: "Liberate your fantasies".
This new perfume is available at The Parfumerie - the number one name for perfumes, cosmetics and skin care.
