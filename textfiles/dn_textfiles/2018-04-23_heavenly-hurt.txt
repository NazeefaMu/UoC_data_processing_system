Heavenly hurt

For many people, fantasy is a formative genre: it slots a numinous filter between the eye and the mind through which the world is viewed for the rest of their lives. Ursula Le Guin’s Earthsea cycle, Alan Garner’s oeuvre – The Weirdstone of Brisingamen, The Owl Service, Elidor – and Susan Cooper’s The Dark is Rising Sequence, interweaving Arthurian legend with a Manichaean battle between the Dark and the Light, have shaped the work of many notable writers, including Robert Macfarlane and S. F. Said.
Transformative fantasy of this kind is seldom purely escapist; rather than transport the ­discontented reader to the imagined position of a high-fantasy king or hero, it evokes the menace and the magic underlying the everyday, hiding in interstitial spaces, or imbued in the stone, grass and rubble of specific landscapes.
Like Emily Dickinson’s “certain Slant of light”, it inflicts a “Heavenly hurt”, working revelatory internal change on the mind that encounters it at the seminal moment. The first part of 2018 has been distinguished by fantasy, both for children and for young adults, with this kind of transformative feel, through which a vein of Irish folklore runs bright as mica.
Underlying war drum
The Wren Hunt (Bloomsbury), Mary Watson’s first novel for teenagers, has a dreamy folk-horror sense about it from the outset: the drubbing of an underlying war drum, more sinister still for its setting in a contemporary, down-at-heel Ireland. In Kilshamble, a village built, ominously, “around an open-air slaughterhouse”, the traditional Wren Day song begins as usual: “The wran, the wran, the king of all birds. / On St Stephen’s Day was caught in the furze”.
Rather than celebrating the bird’s great honour and small size, however, the Kilshamble version continues: “Her clothes were all torn, her shoes all worn, / We chased her all night, right through until dawn”.
In the story, instantly, as in the song, the heraldic bird is replaced with a perturbingly vulnerable, human victim: a girl called Wren who is hunted every December 26 through village, forest and lakeside, until the wren-boys catch her and take a trophy. But there is more underlying the hunt than malicious habit or lust; the boys are draoithe (druids) of the tribe called Judges, and Wren, unknown to them, is an Augur, the Judges’ sworn enemy.
Vital information
To David, well-bred, sadistic pack-leader, she is “oil to his water . . . salt to his wound”, fascinatingly wrong and ripe for torment, like her namesake bird, still hunted for its long-ago treachery. When Wren undertakes an internship at the Harkness Foundation, the stronghold of the Judges, intending to bring back vital information to her family of Augurs, she places herself in the way of harm, revelation, betrayal and the fulfilment of a still greater ritual, in a story that unfurls and peels apart like a flower-human hybrid, bleeding as it blooms.
Beauty and terror join hands with more liminal magic in The Hazel Wood (Penguin), a debut young adult novel by Melissa Albert, deriving its title from Yeats’s “Song of Wandering Aengus”. Throughout her childhood, Alice has moved across America with her mother Ella, leaving one place for another when their luck changes. After they receive the news that Ella’s mother is dead, Ella marries affluent, unimaginative Harold, and attempts to root Alice in a Fifth Avenue, college-application version of normality.
Alice’s grandmother, however, was the reclusive Althea Proserpine, the author of Tales from the Hinterland (a book of terrifying fairy tales with a cult following and a habit of vanishing from shelves, which Alice has never been allowed to read), and normality for Althea’s descendants is a more than ordinarily elusive state. Albert intertwines laconic, pitch-perfect evocations of contemporary American minutiae, such as the jalopy’s smell of “plasticky strawberries, from the day I fed my Tinkerbell lipstick into the slats of the heater vent”, with understated fairy-tale horror (“Her limbs were frail as a frog’s, but her eyes were still a defiant black. It was decided, then: she would live . . . ”), in sinuous, twining prose, full of jam-sweetness and poisoned thorns.
As she plunges her heroine, fuelled both by love and by the rage permanently slumbering under a “pretty little house cat” exterior, first into the Halfway Wood, and then into the Hinterland itself, Albert plays ­elegantly with the concepts of the changeling, belonging, nature versus nurture and the perils of the permeable border between invention and reality, in a frightening, allusive and fiercely intelligent work of fantasy.
Unsettling duology
Painful transformations, sliding all the way into the pure grotesque, are instantly to the fore in Peadar O’Guilin’s The Invasion (David Fickling), the concluding half of the unsettling duology begun in last year’s The Call.
In O’Guilin’s Ireland, cut off from its surroundings by an invisible, impermeable wall, children are an endangered species; at some time during their adolescence, they will hear the inescapable Call that pulls them into the Grey Land, the hostile world of the banished Aes Sídhe (the People of the Mounds, equivalent to elves or fairies).
Here they must endure for an entire day – three minutes in the world they have left behind – without being caught by the Sídhe, who take a casual, laughing revenge for the theft of their homeland by twisting their captives into new and terrible shapes (“flippers for hands and blank skin where once he had a face”; “I made a trellis of him and kissed you to the music of his tears”).
Nessa, though hampered by her disability, survived her Call, as did Anto, her beloved; but now, branded a traitor, she is forced back into the Grey Land, with no ­prospect, this time, of ever escaping it. O’Guilin’s marriage of cruelty and bloodshed, heroic formulae and the power of promises kept and broken is Homeric in its scope and tragedy; as a metaphor for the excruciating metamorphosis of adolescence, too, it seems fitting that “Nothing is more painful than the moulding touch of the Sídhe”.
Contiguous otherworld
For readers aged eight to twelve, Nigel Quinlan’s The Cloak of Feathers (Hachette), set in the remote Irish town of Knockmealldown, features another contiguous otherworld, this one also filled with creatures remote, eldritch and cruel, but comic and comely too; a more customary portrayal of the Good Folk than O’Guilin’s.
Knockmealldown, once magical, is now a miserable place, with a notoriously dreadful annual festival and a deserted estate filled with the squealing of ghost pigs. Before a pig factory poisoned the places beloved of the Folk, the centennial Great Festival united human and fae in raucous, gorgeous celebration; now, however, rather than rejoicing, Brian and his friends must outwit a villainous jester and free a metamorphosed princess to prevent the whole Knockmealldown population spending the rest of their lives as birds.
Mordant (“Bob was always hugely encouraging when other people offered to do things”), evocative (“a tall, unearthly girl with skin the green of a sunlit field and . . . teeth that seemed sharp”) and fast-paced, featuring banshees on bicycles, festival bread baked of peat and oil and a charismatic, frolicking sense of absurdity, it dances precariously along a rope-bridge woven of folklore, comedy, danger and delight, beckoning the beguiled reader to follow.
