District wise approach urged to upscale per capita income

Chairman, MD of Vallibel One Dhammika Perera yesterday expressed hope that per capita income of the Colombo city will reach USD 12,650 mark in three years and be on par with several developed countries.
Noting that Colombo city is home to 5% percent of the total population of the country, Perera stressed the need to initiate district wise approaches to increase per capita income of all other districts which account for 95% of the total population in the country.
“We have to reach those targets while adopting a district wise approach. Otherwise, people won’t be happy,” he said after the bell ringing ceremony at the Colombo Stock Exchange (CSE) last morning.
Vallibel One PLC (Vallibel One) rang the opening bell to commence trading at the Colombo Stock Exchange (CSE) yesterday, as part of a ceremony organized to mark the company’s inclusion in the S&P SL 20 Index. The S&P SL 20 Index includes the 20 largest companies, by total market capitalization, listed on the CSE that meet minimum size, liquidity and financial viability thresholds.
Expressing his views on public policies in Sri Lanka, he said that, success of public policies will mainly depend on the outcome of those respective policies.
Speaking on future plans of his group of companies, Perera said his companies will take the advantage of Artificial Intelligence (AI) technology and Business Intelligence (BI) tools to enhance real-time, smart decision making at boardroom meetings.
Perera, expressed hope that his companies are starting to benefit from this technology and it will soon make its way into the boardroom plans. Speaking further, Perera said he hoped to hold the first ever boardroom meeting, using the AI technology and BI tools most likely in another six months time and intends to implement the same technology throughout all subsidiary companies in the near future.
Commenting on the estimated budget for this initiative, Perera said that the budget will not be that huge.
Perera said that his group of companies has implemented multiple cost cutting initiatives, particularly to improve the group’s financial performance and to face any foreseeable challenges of the Sri Lankan economy in the next five years. Commenting on growth prospects of local tourism industry, Perera said, Sri Lanka needs to focus on attracting not only niche market travelers, also budget travelers to be on par with regional competitors such as Malaysia and Thailand. He said Sri Lanka has 90,000 hotel rooms, including 15,000 star-class rooms and 75,000 non-star budget rooms.
