JO to support JVP’s 20 A

Parliamentarian Bandula Gunawardene, yesterday, said the Joint Opposition will support the JVP’s effort to completely abolish the Executive Presidency, by bringing the 20th Amendment to the Constitution.
Gunawardene, however, said this should include an additional clause that Parliament would be dissolved on the same day when the motion is passed.
Addressing a media briefing in Colombo, Gunawardene said this proposal had the blessings of former President and Kurunegala district MP Mahinda Rajapaksa.
In fact, Gunawardene said, MP Rajapaksa had informed JVP leader and Parliamentarian Anura Kumara Dissanayake that the JO will support the motion to abolish the Executive Presidency if the JVP was willing to add an additional proposal to dissolve Parliament on the same day when the motion is passed.
The JVP recently said they have decided to present the draft of the 20th Amendment to the Constitution as a Private Member’s Bill.
The JVP said the draft has already been prepared and attention has been drawn towards the time period that would be included in the Amendment, and the process that should be followed to get the Amendment passed in Parliament.
