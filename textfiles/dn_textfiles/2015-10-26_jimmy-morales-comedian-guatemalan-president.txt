Jimmy Morales, from comedian to Guatemalan President

GUATEMALA: Guatemalan comedian Jimmy Morales’ entry into politics started out sounding like a joke, but he is now laughing all the way to the presidential palace after a massive corruption scandal upended the election.
Morales, a comic actor and TV personality with no political experience, had just 0.5 percent support in April, at the beginning of his presidential campaign.
But the conservative candidate won a landslide victory in a run-off election Sunday.
Morales rode a wave of disgust among ordinary Guatemalans, who deserted the traditional political elite in outrage over a series of corruption scandals that culminated in the resignation and jailing of president Otto Perez just days before the first-round vote. In a climate of widespread disdain for politics as usual, Morales’ total lack of political experience was seen as a plus.
He declared victory Sunday night, thanking Guatemalans for giving him a “mandate... to fight the corruption that has consumed us.”
“My commitment remains to God and the Guatemalan people, and I will work with all my heart and strength not to defraud you,” he said.
His opponent, former first lady Sandra Torres, conceded defeat and wished him success. Morales, 46, is famous for his 2007 film “A President in a Sombrero,” in which he plays a country bumpkin cowboy named Neto who nearly gets elected president by accident.
Neto surges in the polls by making a string of empty promises on the campaign trail, but ends up dropping out of the race and returning to his hometown.
