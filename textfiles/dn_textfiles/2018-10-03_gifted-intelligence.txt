Gifted  intelligence

She is an inspiring leader. She has a wide array of talents, has much insight, and is a charismatic and confident individual. Perfect Prefects features Head Girl of Pushpadana Girls’ College Kandy, Ama Dharmakeerthi who has achieved success through her determination.
‘Wisdom Shines through Character’ is the motto at Pushpadana Girls’ College Kandy. And Dharmakeerthi points out that her school has enabled her to stand strong anywhere in the world.
“Gifting intelligent, creative and honourable young women with exemplary characters is the mission of our school. There’s a strong academic atmosphere in the school. The young ladies are guided by a devoted teaching staff who help them to develop their personalities. My school has played a major role in shaping up my character. It is my school that identified my hidden skills and talents. I have tried more than half the extracurricular activities and sports to identify what goes with me the best. I loved all of them so I became an all-rounder. Many teachers and elder sisters motivated me to develop my personality, courage and confidence. My teachers even stayed after school, to help me catch up with the missed lessons and their support has been wonderful,” said Dharmakeerthi.
Role model
Courage is a characteristic that is essential if one is to move forward in the world. She very correctly points out that young people need a courageous role model with a well -balanced personality. Because along with courage comes an attitude that can influence young people, thus becoming a guiding light for young people to move forward in the path of success.
Self- belief is key to her success. She has properly assessed her strengths and weaknesses. For her, becoming Head Prefect was a childhood dream.
“From Grade 3, I practised my first head prefect speech under the shower. I had a strong determination that I will achieve my goals and I worked hard for that. I have to thank my parents, the school I got primary education, my current school Pushpadana, our madam principal, teachers, friends, competitors and motivators who have been the pillars of my success. I would like to attribute my success to my prefect’s committee as well because they are the best team any leader can ever have,” stated Dharmakeerthi.
From the leaders she admires, the current president of Croatia, Kolinda Grabar -Kitarvi, Dr Martin Luther King Jr. and Sirimavo Bandaranaike are some of them.
Great leader
“I appreciate the intelligence and passion of Kolinda Grabar -Kitarvi, the President of Croatia. Her humble and simple character reflects the great leader that lives within her. Her desire to enrich her mind with knowledge is a lesson for all women in the world.
I also admire Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. who had a dream to bring light to the lives of Afro-Americans and he was the live wire behind the banishment of colour based discrimination. The late Prime Minister of Sri Lanka Sirimavo Bandaranaike, who became the world’s first female head of government is a leader I adore because she opened doors for women to engage in the field of politics with confidence,” explained Dharmakeerthi.
In Dharmakeerthi’s own words – ‘Making a difference in society is a tremendous task but a small spark in the positive direction can light up the whole world.’
“I’m someone who believes that we should change for the better first, to make the world a better place to live. We hear many injustices happening in the world in many ways. Some superpowers are using their upper hand to oppress the developing and undeveloped countries that are trying to gain economic stability. I would like to help stop the manufacturing and selling of lethal weapons and destroy them forever. I would like to influence and encourage my fellow sisters and brothers to strengthen their walk on a steady path toward a better future. I wish to live in a world bereft of discriminations where all of us can live with peace, love, happiness and harmony,” points out Dharmakeerthi.
Her vision is to start a business firm that provides many job opportunities for people. She also has a dream to become a motivational speaker.
Injustice for child
“This is so I can influence and develop positive attitudes in the minds of youth. I want to become someone who can set an example to young leaders with a need to change the world. In my point of view, there are many injustices happening in the world. Child labour, child exploitation, condemnation of women in the employment sector, cruelty towards animals, the wide social disparity, environmental pollution, war and violence can be mentioned as few of them. I want to stand up against discrimination, having the hope of a better world. I would like to be a voice for female empowerment because I am a girl and I have the power,” explained Dharmakeerthi.
For her, life is a learning experience and an opportunity to develop one’s leadership skills. She points out that developing insights into people is necessary.
“Our world is developing day by day with modern technology. There is much competition since there’s easy access to gain information. The modern generation is caught up in a constant struggle with scientific technology and everything has become complex. Leadership is not just having titles or ranks but influencing the followers to do better in their lives. For a school leaver, there are ample opportunities if you have a goal in mind along with self -confidence. I believe you should achieve your dreams by working hard because your dreams should guide your way. Don’t ever give up what interests you, because you never lose until you stop trying. Keep moving forward. Things may not be easy sometimes, but even if you are going through hell, keep going. Either you win or learn but never lose. One day, you will discover the correct way to fight against the hardships and accomplish your goal,” explained Dharmakeerthi.
When facing pressure, and when thinking of ways to solve the challenges in an efficient way, she always discusses the matter with her parents, Madam Principal or teachers and receives the best advice.
Immediate action
“Pressure comes in different ways. Sometimes when things have gone wrong, you need to have that pressure to take immediate action. Sometimes it is just you who needlessly pressurizes yourself over irrelevant things. The first thing I do when I’m under pressure is sorting the type of pressure into these two categories. Then the problem will appear simple and less stressful. I read the motivational sayings regarding the problem and refer to articles posted on websites. I also listen to some motivational songs and they provide relaxation to my mind. As I’m a good artist, drawing keeps me calm. I try to take a break if that is still not solved. Then I meditate for a while. Trying to find a solution all by myself seems stressful, but for me, facing challenges is really interesting because there won’t be a rainbow without rain,” added Dharmakeerthi.
Quoting the saying ‘The more that you read, the more things you’ll know, the more that you learn, the more places you’ll go”, she says that reading is the best medicine that heals the mind.
“It is a well- known fact that all the competent leaders throughout history and even in the present are avid readers. I read all sorts of books which I find appealing. They motivate me to look at life from a better point of view. I listen to a few songs daily because music is the magic that gives life to us. My favourite songs are “Hall of fame” and “I was here”. I love all the songs that motivate me and keep me calm. Music changes my mood and makes me happy,” said Dharmakeerthi.
In her words, an obstacle is actually an opportunity and any obstacle is difficult if we take it as a problem.
Common problems
“I look at all obstacles as challenges that are going to shape up my life and develop my personality. The common problems I had to face were balancing studies with the Prefect-ship, being focused, being liked and respected, staying motivated, handling stubborn people and dealing with peers and society,” said Dharmakeerthi.
Her final message to the youth is a powerful one.
“I would like to tell all young leaders who are struggling hard to balance their life with extra curricula and academics, that you are all amazing and wonderful. I want you all to be strong and confident because you have the power and potential to change the world into a better place. Use your strengths and talents to create the life of your dreams. Be a kind-hearted and a caring person. Don’t ever stay stagnated in one place. Keep going. I know it is very hard sometimes but don’t give up. Youth is the best period of your life. Spare that extra hour of sleep for studies. Work hard and rise with pride. You can do it!” summed up Dharmakeerthi.
