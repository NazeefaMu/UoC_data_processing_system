Moves to boost seafood exports

The Fisheries and Aquatic Resources Development Ministry will strengthen the country’s seafood export industry by solving the issues faced by seafood exporters to meet the annual export target of USD 1.5 billion, Fisheries and Aquatic Resources Development State Minister Dilip Wedaarachchi said.
During a discussion held recently with the seafood exporters at the ministry, the State Minister requested the seafood exporters to report all issues faced by them within a week. He pledged to solve the issues immediately after discussing with the President, Prime Minister and the subject minister.
He stressed the importance of attracting local and foreign investors for the seafood export industry.
The State Minister said it was important to follow the recommendations of the Indian Ocean Tuna Commission as well as international rules and regulations to reduce post-harvest losses to produce high quality seafood products for the export market.
“Modern technologies used to increase the fisheries production with a minimum cost of production will be introduced for local fishermen in the near future,” he said.
During the discussion, the seafood exporters expressed their willingness to use modern fishing vessels with satellite technology. Fisheries Department officers said they have commenced a pilot project to use such fishing vessels. Measures will be taken to issue permits after considering the progress of the pilot project.
