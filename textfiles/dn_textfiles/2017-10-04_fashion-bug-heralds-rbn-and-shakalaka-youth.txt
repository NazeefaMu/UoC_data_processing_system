Fashion Bug heralds RBN and  Shakalaka for youth

Fashion Bug launched two divers fashion ranges, RBN and Shakalaka at their latest outlet in Wellawatte.
The two collections with their own character and concepts, cater to the sporty, young and trendy fashion enthusiasts. The event was attended by Sri Lanka’s rugby legend Fazil Marija and popular actress Pooja Umashankar, along with several renowned sports personalities and other key Fashion Bug customers.
Sri Lanka is currently undergoing a fitness revolution and thus, heralding performance wear into Sri Lanka’s fashion industry, RBN launched their line for men and women, for the first time through Fashion Bug. The brand focuses on producing active wear with high quality at an affordable price. Each design is created with the Sri Lankan athlete in mind, and to suit the local climate and user conditions. RBN is set to be the prime home-grown sportswear, which combines fashion and performance for the professional as well as the amateur athlete.
The attention grabbing Shakalaka range, made for the teenage and youth, was launched by the trendy fashion label ChaThak; a name synonymous for colourful t-shirts with catchy lines. The collection joins the list of creative ranges by ChaThak like ‘Swag Baby’, ‘Big Boss Forever’, ‘Sniper Sleeves’ and ‘Lyrical Tees’. Shakalaka launched exclusively for Fashion Bug and will be available at all the branches.
