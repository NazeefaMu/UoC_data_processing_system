The Colombo High Court yesterday served indictments on former Deputy Minister Sarath Kumara Gunaratne and five others for allegedly misappropriating Rs. 11.2 million of public funds allocated for the Negombo Lagoon Development Project by utilising the funds for former President Mahinda Rajapaksa’s presidential campaign.
When the case came up before High Court Judge Shashi Mahendran, the matter was fixed for trial on August 9. The Attorney General had filed indictments against six accused including former Fisheries Deputy Minister Sarath Kumara Gunaratne, his son-in-law Upul Chaminda Kumarasinghe, Ceylon Fisheries Harbour Corporation’s (CFHC) former chairman Upali Liyanage, its former general manager Piyal Abeysekara, Chandana Pelpita and Lakmina Munidasa, in this case. They were charged under the Public Property Act for the alleged misappropriation of Rs. 11.2 million belonging to CFHC during the 2015 Presidential Election. The Attorney General alleged that the accused had committed six offences under the Public Property Act, between November 20, 2014 and January 7, 2015.
The Special Presidential Investigation Commission had recommended that the Attorney General’s advice be sought to institute legal action against the persons responsible for this alleged financial fraud. Senior State Counsel Sudarshana de Silva appeared for the Attorney General.
President’s Counsel Nalin Ladduwahetty with Saliya Peiris, PC, Senior Counsel Lal Kularatne, Upul Kumarapperuma, Counsel Sampath Mendis, Thilina Kollure and Gayathri Wijesuriya appeared for the accused.
