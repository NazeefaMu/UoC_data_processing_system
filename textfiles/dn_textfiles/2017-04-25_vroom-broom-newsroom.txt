Vroom on a broom in newsroom

I believe in witches. No, not witchcraft but simply witches. Oh yes, witches are real. Some emphatically don’t look like typical witch es with green skin, pointy hats, the broomstick conveyance or cackling laugh. But I did know a horrible harridan woman reporter who rode a powerful motorbike with reckless abandon. We uncharitably called her ‘a road hag.’ Her motorbike was referred to as the baaaarrrroooooooommmm!
Although I did encounter at least one old crone with partially dyed green hair and a voice that sounded like a flock of crows cawing and pecking at a ‘takarang’ roof. But I know for sure that they do exist. Throughout history there have been several famous, or rather notorious witches. But none so itchy, bitchy and witchy as some I have encountered in the journalistic profession. Unlike the Wicked Witch of the West and other witch stereotypes, they look and act fairly normal at first sight. Having spent a lifetime in a dozen or more newspapers both at home and abroad I know them when I see them.
I have come across some of the wackiest wiccans who brewed up so much trouble in their catty cauldrons that had editors climbing walls. I am not such a fool as to believe in witches that turn men into frogs simply by casting a spell on them. Yet, some of them are known to have made asses of men by kissing them and turning them into horny toads.
Now don’t get me wrong. I am not saying that all female newswomen or women in general are witches. I have found the majority of them to be bewitching in the most delightful way. Many of them manifest several admirable traits such as charm compounded with astounding writing skills. Ask any woman journo who has worked with me or under my tenure as editor and they will attest to the fact that I am no male chauvinist piggy-wiggy.
That is because I have certainly not been stupid when it comes to interfering in the rights of women. All but bigoted buffoons underestimate the intelligence of the females of the species. I have learned by sheer experience that this perception is all too true. Insight comes naturally to women. They somehow have that inherent ability to see things intuitively which otherwise is not possible by logical thinking.
I am no Freudian pundit, but one thing I know for certain is that feminine intuition is a super sensory phenomenon. Well, there is a reason for all of this and there is absolutely no point in trying to understand it since it is one of the world’s greatest truisms that women are impossible to fathom. Greater men have tried and have been found wanting.
Part of the feminine brain linked to gut feelings is larger and more discerning in women. So disregard ‘woman’s intuition’ at your peril, buddy boys. They don’t need soothsayers or oracles because every woman is an Oracle. And they know it.
You see, some of the most magnificent and loyal friends, colleagues and subordinates I have been associated with are women. Some of the people I trust most in the world are women. I have had far more conflict in my life with men than I have had with women. The only difference is that I have been far more hurt and betrayed by men than I have by women. Ironically I have been sold down the river by many of those men who I have helped in their careers because of envy or ambition.
Now all this brings us to the logical theory of a witch switch in gender. In times of yore men witches were known as ‘Warlocks’ which sounds pretty respectable in a masculine sort of way. But in my lexicon a witch is a witch is a witch, whether male or female.
And when you come to modern times you encounter a whole lot of both male and female hag cliques led by a queen hag, or closet queen fag organising office witch hunts. One of my deputy editors Steve was a fair and firm administrator. When a woman writer complained he was sexist in his assessment review of her work and had been going round calling her a witch he laughingly denied it. Amid chortles he said: “How could I ever call you that when everyone knows for sure you can’t cast spells or even spell properly.”
On another occasion a woman feature writer, who knew she was dubbed the office witch, who was back from an overseas assignment handed him a highly overblown expense account chit. He sent it back with a memo stating: “Did the hotels charge for broom service as well?”
There was a short, stubby mean-spirited copy editor named Sammy Jacks, who was a malevolent male misfit and a known bully.He consistently keptmaking attempts to browbeat a few trainee journalists. Beauty may be only skin deep, but he was ugly and I mean ugly, clean to the bone.
He really had his comeuppance when he called a willowy, radical female cub-reporter a witch. Little did he realise that the cutest editorial kitten had the sharpest claws. She fired back instantly: “Why you ugly little toad, I would put a curse on you, but somebody appears to have beaten me to it!” As the rest of the staff roared their mirthful approval she continued: “I am not riding my broom because I am afraid I am flying off the handle!”
She threatened that that she was “so peed off” with him that she would “go to the toilet on his head and drown him.”
Witnesses say she also gave him a painful jab in the ribs with her bony elbow for good measure. A terrified Sammy evidently did not wait to find out whether her elbow would be worse than her overflow. Besides, he had never learned to swim. He beat a hasty retreat as fast as his stubby little legs could carry him to a corner of the office where he sulked for months.
But not before he complained bitterly to Steve who admonished him with: “Sammy, I know which witch is which. Of all the witches I have encountered I am aware that you are worst of them. We all know that you go vroom on a broom in the newsroom!” What he didn’t tell him was that the witty wench at the inquiry had called Sammy ‘a witch with a capital B!’
