Electoral College votes Real Voter Population

The ancient Athenians had political equality, not merely through right to vote, but also had a clear opportunity to participate in public policy debates and influence political decisions. Unfortunately, the US voters currently cannot enjoy the basic democratic essences of elections. The US elections do not carry equal representation for their citizens. Recent US Presidential election is not a positive example of democracy but also a major challenge to it.
Former Sectary of State, Hillary Clinton won the 2016 Presidential election by three million votes but lost the White House by 74 Electoral votes. This was the fifth time in the US history, candidate who won the election by so called popular votes and lost the White House. The US is the only country in the world, uses Electoral votes to elect their President over common voters regular ballots, which are called as popular votes. This had happened in 1824, 1876, 1888, and 2000 US Presidential elections. During the 2000 Presidential election, George W. Bush received 50.46 million votes (47.9 percent) compared to 51 million votes (48.4 percent) for Al Gore. The Democratic Party candidate Al Gore carried 540,000 more votes than his rival candidate but lost the White House by five Electoral votes. This weird, undemocratic scenario had happened again after sixteen years in the 21st century.
The United States Electoral College is a mechanism established by Article Two of the United States Constitution. Representation in the Electoral College is based on population, which is assessed every ten years by the census. Each state receives a minimum of three electoral votes. Additional votes are assigned for each seat a state holds in Congress above that minimum.
This is a cross between how congressional seats are assigned in the House of Representatives, where they are divided according to the population with a minimum of one per state, and the Senate, where each state is represented equally by two Senators. Each US state carries two Senate seats despite their populations. Alaska, Delaware, Montana, North Dakota, South Dakota, Vermont and Wyoming are the seven least populated States, which represent 4.8 million voters. They enjoy fourteen US Senate seats while Minnesota, which represents 4.9 million voters, just has only two US Senate seats!
Electoral vote system
The founding fathers didn't unanimously agree on the Electoral vote system. There were sharp divisions on this weird vote system. According to “Records of the Federal Convention,” James Madison and significant numbers of delegates were in favour of popular vote to elect the US President over Electoral College mechanism. However, Electoral College mechanism was used as a bribe for nationalist Southerners. James Madison stated as “the right of suffrage was much more diffusive in the Northern than the Southern States, and the latter could have no influence in the election on the score of Negroes. The substitution of electors obviated this difficulty and seemed, on the whole, to be liable to the fewest objections”. During last two hundred years, more than 700 constitution amendments were presented to the US Congress to amend or abolished the Electoral College mechanism because this voting system has been violating basic equal representation in the democracy is defined as “one person, one vote,”. However not a single amendment was successful.
Because of the Electoral College system, Presidential elections campaigns are mostly focused on “swing states” like Michigan, Pennsylvania, Florida, New Hampshire, North Carolina, Iowa, Pennsylvania, Virginia, Wisconsin and Ohio. Most states in the US are neglected during the presidential election cycles and “swing states” voters get significant attention over the rest of the other voters. In addition small states are having a prominence under current Electoral College system and there votes are more powerful than other states. This is a clear unequal representation.
Professor Benjamin Bolinger, who authored a research article “Abolishing the Electoral College” on International Social Science Review, stated that states with small populations control a disproportionate number of electoral votes compared to those with large populations. According to the 2000 census, California's population was 33, 871,648 giving it fifty five electoral votes and Wyoming, the least populous state, had only 493,782 residents, earning three electoral votes. California gets one electoral vote per 615, 848 residents; Wyoming receives one electoral vote per 165,594 residents. That is approximately 4 to 1 ration advantage of Wyoming. Not only Wyoming but also Vermont, North Dakota also have voter advantage over Texas and Florid respectively. Professor Bolinger further stated “When the votes of some citizens count more than others, America has failed to honour its commitment to equal representation”.
Equality in voter power
Famous mathematicians and game theoreticians like William H. Riker, I. Mann, L.S. Shapley, and John F. Banzhaf III vigorously studied about correlations on Electoral and popular votes. In 1968, John F. Banzhaf III generated a formula called “voter power”, which was a function of (1) the probability that a citizen's vote could change a state's votes for a given candidate, and (2) the probability the state's electoral votes could decide the outcome of the national election.
John F. Banzhaf III, who authored a research article “One Man, 3.312 Votes: A mathematical analysis of the Election College” on Villanova Law Review, proved that voter in New York state had 3.312 times more ability to affect Presidential election than the least powerful state. He concluded his research paper “the current Electoral College system falls short of even and approximation of equality in voter power”. Another mathematician S. Merrill further developed Banzhaf's voter power model and presented a research paper “Citizen Voter power under the Electoral College: A Stochastic model based on state voting patterns” on SIAM Journal on Applied Mathematics, in 1978. He also proved that different states had different voter power on Electoral College system. This was a gross violation of equal representation in democracy is defined as “one person, one vote,” which means every citizen's vote has an equal value.
More equal representation is necessary to strength the democratic elections in the US. To achieve this target, Electoral College votes system should be abolished and popular vote should be introduced.
The Electoral College vote's allocation does not represent the real voter population. If real voter population represent on the last Presidential election, Hillary Clinton will take office as the 45th President of the United States.
