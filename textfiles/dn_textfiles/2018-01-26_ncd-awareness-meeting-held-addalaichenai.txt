NCD awareness meeting  held in Addalaichenai

A special non-communicable disease (NCD) awareness meeting and free medical camp for the members of the public was held at the Addalaichenai Ayurvedic Base Hospital, recently. Addalaichenai Ayurvedic Base Hospital Medical Officer-in-Charge Dr. K. M. Aslam organized the programme.
Members of the public including children and youths, made use of the medical facilities offered by the camp. Ayurvedic doctors Farwin Mohideen, Fasmina Aroos, I. L. Abdul Hai, and S. M. Rizhad participated.
Society should take measures to protect itself from non-communicable diseases, especially considering eating habits. It was recorded that around 20 percent of the world’s population is affected by NCDs. By 2020, it would be double the number, Dr. Aslam said. “We do not pay sufficient attention to food, and due to the lack of physical exercise, people are suffering from diabetes, paralysis, hypertension and other heart diseases. In Sri Lanka, the NCD death rate has risen by 65 percent,” he further said.
