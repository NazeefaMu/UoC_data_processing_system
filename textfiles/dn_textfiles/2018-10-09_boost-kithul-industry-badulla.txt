Boost for kithul industry in Badulla

Four rural kithul industry development projects were approved by the Fisheries, Aquatic Resources Development and Rural Economy Ministry to be carried out in Ella, Hali-Ela, Soranathota, and Uva Paranagama.
They will be facilitated by the Divisional Secretariats for the four areas, under the guidance of the District Secretariat of Badulla.
An official report on the four initiatives stated that Rs. 612,371 had been earmarked for the project in Ella.
Meanwhile, Rs. 510,309, Rs. 204,123 and Rs. 234,742 were earmarked for each of the projects to be carried out at Hali-Ela, Soranathota and Uva Paranagama, the report added.
The projects will contribute to the government-initiated National Kithul Development Programme, being implemented countrywide to promote the kithul industry.
Badulla is one of the 18 kithul producing districts where a large number of rural families earn an income by producing kithul juggery and kithul syrup.
