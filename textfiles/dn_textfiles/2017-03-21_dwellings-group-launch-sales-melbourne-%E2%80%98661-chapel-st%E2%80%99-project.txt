Dwellings Group to launch sales of  Melbourne ‘661 Chapel St.’ project

Dwellings Group will launch residential sales of “661 Chapel St.”, their new 30-storied high rise on Chapel St. in urban Melbourne with large apartments that can be customised by buyers, and an opulent luxury-hotel-style entrance and art gallery.
661 Chapel St. Property Showcase will be conducted by Dwellings Group at the Ivy Room of Cinnamon Grand, Colombo on March 25 and 26,2017 which will allow investors to have one-on-one discussions with the property experts.
The 30-storey project with only 116 apartments, by Malaysian public listed developer Gamuda Land, has been designed by Melbourne architects Bird de la Coeur on a site near the Vogue shopping centre. Prestige buyers can buy individual apartments or buy entire floors.
Residents will enter ‘661 Chapel Street’ through a covered gateway cobbled in bluestone leading to a grand lobby with a concierge. A cantilevered 25-metre lap pool will hang over the entry while a bold lighting installation of suspended orbs by Israeli artist Omer Arbel makes the first impression inside. Another luxury touch is the ground-floor art space, which will include sculptural pieces by French crystal brand Lalique, including a collaboration with English artist Damien Hirst.
Part of South Yarra's precinct - 661 Chapel has views over Melbourne High School towards the city skyline and bay. The developer has sought to distinguish the building over neighboring towers with glamorous design features.
“661 Chapel Street is a building with international design DNA flowing through every space, from the dramatic porte-cochere entry to the onyx library and then the spectacular apartments,” says Gamuda Land Executive.
Level six will include more communal spaces for residents such as a spa, gym, steam room, sauna, residents’ lounge, barbecue facilities, private cinema, wine room and private dining room. Amenities include a cinema room, treatment room, studio and a sharing terrace.
Owning a home at 661 Chapel St. gives you a sense of pride each time you look out the window. Each level has a stunning view of a panoramic overview that reveals the expanse of the neighborhood with a dramatic city skyline. Lower levels are equally impressive with soothing sights of the Yarra River.
Dwellings Group Director Navin De Silva said, “We have been selling consistently in Melbourne and can see ripples of a healthier market for Sri Lankans wanting to invest overseas. Melbourne has been the Most Livable City in the World for six consecutive years including 2016.
Chapel Street apartments have been designed keeping in mind each type of lifestyle, investment, preference and purpose as there are both multiple options of layouts and sizes. Dwellings Group is known for great quality and we are ranked highly in the industry, because we do everything from start to finish ourselves. Our project is strategically located in South Yarra which is a hotspot for apartment development.”
