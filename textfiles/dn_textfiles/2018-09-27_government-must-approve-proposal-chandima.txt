Galle Marina Park
Government must approve  proposal - Chandima

The government will be requested to discuss the proposed Galle Marina Park tourism project encompassing a part of the Galle Port, at the Galle District Development Committee meeting, before going ahead with it, Galle District UPFA Parliamentarian Chandima Weerakkody said.
Although the tourism industry was a positive factor for the development of Galle, it should be undertaken according to a stable economic policy without relying on the private agendas of ministers, he said.
There was doubt as to whether even the Cabinet of Ministers had been notified about the proposed tourism project in Galle.
Earlier, there was an instance where Telecommunication, Digital Infrastructure and Foreign Employment Deputy Minister Manusha Nanayakkara alleged that the Galle Marina Park project was a clandestine attempt to give away a section of the Galle Port to foreign companies.
The Deputy Minister alleged that tenders had already been called for the Galle Marina Park project connecting Galle Port and the Buona Vista beach. Five acres from Galle Port will be vested in the project during the first stage, and the Bouna Vista beach too would be vested in it during the second stage, Weerakkody said.
