PPUF to demo against sale of Colombo Port’s Eastern Terminal

The Ports Protection Union Front (PPUF) will hold a demonstration against the sale of the Eastern Terminal of the Colombo Port by the Government in front of the Presidential Secretariat on February 1, with the participation of all progressive forces, other trade unions and Ports
employees.
The President of National Trade Union Center and Member of the Political Bureau of the JVP K. D. Lalkantha said yesterday, that Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe was engaged in selling main economic centres in the country according to his wish. President Maithripala Sirisena who was elected by the people could step in to stop these attempts.
It was revealed that an agreement in this regard was to be signed on February 2. That was the reason why we wish to stop this move and meet the President to discuss this matter with him, Lalkantha said.
He said the Prime Minister is trying to sell all the country’s assets to save his own skin, adding that the 440 metres of the jetty had been completed and comprising of an eighteen metre jetty wall and a 22 hectare area with facilities for development from the Ports Authority. The terminal was dredged to the depth of 18 metres to accommodate bigger ships.
Selling this terminal to a foreign company would cause a heavy loss to the Ports Authority since it was generating a massive income to the country.
“All constructions of the Eastern Terminal have already been completed at present and only the machinery has to be installed. Once the machinery is installed, the terminal would make a huge profit. It has been estimated that the process of installing the machinery, including the importing of them, would take around 11 months. It is then clear that from the 12th month on wards, the terminal would make profits. So, it is a big devastation, if this terminal would be sold to a foreign company,” Lalkantha said.
“The Hambantota Harbour would be given to China and the Trincomalee Port to India. Accordingly, all the ports would be sold to other countries for the economic survival of the government. Therefore, we invite all patriotic forces to join our struggle on February 1,” he said.
He said the Ports Minister appointed by the President says he knew nothing about this. So, we are certain that the Prime Minister is doing this even without the knowledge of the Ports Minister, he further said.”
He also said the Engineers Association and trade unions in the Port have a systematic plan that could be used to make the Colombo Port into a profitable organization without going for privatization. So, we urge the President to give us the opportunity to discuss this matter, he said.
The All Ceylon Port General Employees’ Union General Secretary Chandrasiri Mahagamage, said the Ports Authority earned a considerable revenue today which channels to the Treasury for the welfare of the public. The Eastern Terminal which was the biggest terminal of the Colombo Port and selling it to a foreign company would decrease the revenue and put the jobs of its employees at risk.
He said the government is trying to sell the Trincomalee Port to India. But we are able to earn a huge revenue from its oil tanks alone.
Convernor of the Voice Against Corruption and JVP Politburo Member Wasantha Samarasinghe, said even if the President was there, the government was running according to the wishes of the Prime Minister.
“We urge the President to intervene in to the selling of our national assets by the Prime Minister who has no mandate from the people. He is trying to sell our national assets to appease foreign forces that supported him to come into power. He also knows that once he retired from his job, he could get a good job in a foreign country or a Western Organization, if he works according to their agendas,” he said.
