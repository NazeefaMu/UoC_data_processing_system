Lighting the magic of Christmas

The three-day Christmas festival organised by Lake House themed Believe in the Magic at Lake House, ended yesterday. The festival featured carols with the Army, Navy, and the Air Force bands taking part. The Army band featured on Friday, the Navy band on Saturday, and the Air Force band played yesterday. This is the first time that Lake House organised a Christmas festival of this nature to share the joy and happiness of the season. Here are some highlights from the three-day Christmas festival.
