Government should assist development of state institutions: Rajitha

Only 11 state institutions are making losses under the present government while all other state institutions are making profits, Health Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne said.
According to Minister Senaratne, the government should assist to develop all state institutions and to bring them up to a profit making level. The belief that 'State institutions cannot make profits' is only a myth. State institutions can make profits with proper management, he said addressing the gathering after opening a Suposha and milk sales centre at Kandana recently.
Minister Senaratne pointed out that he often received loss making institutions with different state ministries in the past and he changed them all to profit making state institutions. "I distributed the profit among employees. But at a later state those profit making state institutions started to make losses again with the change of administration."
Senaratne stated that two or more state institutions can get together and open sales centres countrywide to supply their products to the people.
This is a very successful strategy, he pointed out.
Health Deputy Minister and many others were also present at the occasion.
