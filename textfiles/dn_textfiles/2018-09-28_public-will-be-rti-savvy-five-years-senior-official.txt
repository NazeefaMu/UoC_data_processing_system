Public will be RTI savvy in five years - Senior official

Finance and Mass Media Ministry Additional Secretary Thilaka Jayasundara said access to information would be a part of Sri Lankan culture in the next five years.
Speaking at the inauguration of the Research Symposium on Right to Information (RTI) held at Hotel Janaki yesterday, she said the Finance and Mass Media Ministry has already introduced programmes to enhance knowledge of both supply and demand side of RTI.
“We consider the public as the demand side of the RTI and the public sector to be the supply side of RTI. So having a good combination between these two sides is important to enhance transparency and participatory approach for the development of the country.” she said.
Jayasundara further said that within two years of implementing the RTI in Sri Lanka, universities and other RTI activists are conducting research on RTI implementation, good governance, transparency and public service excellence.
“It is very important to enhance public service excellence to enhance the socio-economic development of the world.” she added.
Delivering the keynote speech, Indian Political and Social Activist Dr. Aruna Roy said the Right to Information has become a universal law deeply appreciated by people as a critical factor in ensuring fair decent and ethical governance.
