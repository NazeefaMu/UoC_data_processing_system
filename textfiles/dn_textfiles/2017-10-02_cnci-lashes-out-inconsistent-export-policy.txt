CNCI lashes out at inconsistent export policy

The Ceylon National Chamber of Industries (CNCI) lashed out at the government and said that although the government says it wants to promote exporters, it is not supporting this effort.
One of the biggest issues is inconsistency of regulations and we need a clear policy statement from the government which would stay in place for a longer period of time, the CNCI said.
“Each time a budget is read out, we see changes and this should not be the ideal way to promote exporters.”

Former President CNCI Gamini Gunasekera said that today the government is looking at signing several FTAs with countries like Singapore, Bangladesh and China and is also looking at an enhanced cooperation agreement (ETCA) with India in addition to the present FTA.
He said that before implementing these, the anti-dumping law must come into place or the local industries may be at a huge risk.
“Local industries cannot compete with cheap and inferior dumped goods and this law must be put into place. Successive ministers in charge of industries for the past eight years have promised to bring this in Parliament, but it is still to happen.”
Successive governments have made a concerted effort to promote Sri Lankan exports. In their endeavor to promote exports, a concessionary tax rate was granted to profits attributable to export-related turnover, said President of CNCI, Tissa Seneviratne.
“As you are aware, a small price differential can result in securing an export order or losing it altogether to a competitor from another country. The concessionary income tax rate offered to exporters was an incentive for companies to enter the export market. Under the new Inland Revenue Act, only a business with exports of at least 80% of their turnover will qualify for a concessionary tax rate. This really discourages SME exporters.”
“An existing business cannot enter an export market to export 80% of their production initially. Most exporters entered the export market with small orders and gradually increase export volumes. It is therefore important to incentivize every individual export if the intention of the government is to encourage newcomers to enter the export market. This was achieved hitherto by granting a concessionary tax rate to the profit attributable to export turnover, irrespective of its value to total turnover.
“Our Chamber represents many indirect exporters who have immensely benefited from such tax concessions. They were able to price their products to exporters lower than what they would offer to the local market considering the benefit of taxation.”
Only established exporters stand to gain from tax concessions offered to companies achieving a 80% export target. Some of the large exporters today too would have had a low percentage of their turnover as exports in their initial years of operations. Would they have pursued an export strategy if tax incentives were not available even with a lower percentage of export turnover?
“What would be the overall impact when a concession enjoyed by many businesses up to now are withdrawn overnight? We appeal to you to maintain the concessionary tax rates granted to exporters and indirect exporters irrespective of the volume of their exports.
“The government launched a national programme this year to nurture 2,000 new entrepreneurs to become exporters. The proposed increase of taxation will adversely impact entrepreneurs coming under this programme which certainly is not the intention of the government. These entrepreneurs would have prepared their business plans considering the concessionary tax rate applicable to exporters.”
Former President CNCI Ranjith Hettiarachchi said that they were surprised to note the tax imposed on R&D, an area lacking in the Sri Lankan sector. “Research and Development is the key to the success of any country and Korea and Japan are the living examples for it. However back in Sri Lanka, for reasons best known to the government, a tax is imposed on R&D and this is absurd.”
“We also strongly condemn the plan to tax senior citizens of their savings deposits. This segment should be left free of any taxes.”
He also said that the government must re-look the corporate tax policy again.
Special Representative, for SME, CNCI, K.C. Vignarajah said that it is true that the government needs revenue. “Why not look within the government and try to reduce some Ministers, turn around some of the ailing SOEs like SriLankan and try to save money.”
“It was a popular slogan during the elections that high personalities in the previous government robbed and their money was deposited overseas. So get them and stop taxing the key areas of growth which would have long term negative impacts on the economy.”
