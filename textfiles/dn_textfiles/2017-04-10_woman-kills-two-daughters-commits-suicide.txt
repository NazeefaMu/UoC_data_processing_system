Woman kills two daughters, commits suicide

A mother of three named Nadeeka Maduranthi Gunasekara (30) of Viharapalugama, Anuradhapura had committed suicide by hanging from a beam in her home after killing her two daughters by pushing them into a nearby well.
Her eldest child Kavish Ashmitha Weerawije was inside the house unaware of the ordeal. He had alerted neighbours after seeing the mother hanging from the beam. Anuradhapura police said Nadeeka, whose husband is a naval officer attached to the Diyatalawa Camp, had a secret love affair.
A third party had come to know about her love affair and she was suspected to have ended her life through sheer shame thinking that her husband may come to know about her affair through the third party. The bodies of the two daughters Ruwani Nuwangalee (4), and Bigunya Heshani (1 1/2) were fished out of the well in the presence of Anuradhapura Acting Magistrate Akashi Nadee Kurera and Anuradhapura Hospital JMD Dr. H.M. Karunatilleke. The Acting Magistrate who held the inquiry ordered the JMD to hold an autopsy and submit a report.
