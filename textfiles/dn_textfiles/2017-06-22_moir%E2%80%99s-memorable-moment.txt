Moir’s memorable moment

Moir students to participate in World’s First International Robotics Olympiad:
With a mission to spread science and technology leadership around the world, FIRST Global is launching the world's first International Robotics Olympiad for high school students which will take place from July 16 to 18 in Washington D.C.
In Sri Lanka, with the collaboration of Tech Assured Holdings (Pvt), it was Elizabeth Moir School’s immediate and enthusiastic response in the midst of tight deadlines that led to their selection as the official team that will represent the country in the 2017 FIRST Global Challenge.
Ishini Gammanpila, Akash Gnanam, Ali Anver and Vinidu Jayasekera are the Moir students who will represent Sri Lanka at the event. The team members possesses an eclectic mix of talents and are a far cry from the stereotypical STEM ‘geeks’ portrayed in mainstream media.
Gammanpila who has been building remote controlled boats with her father since she was eight was one of the leads in this year’s school play – ‘Rumours.’ She is also a full scholar at the school who has excelled not only academically but also in swimming, singing and dancing. Gnanam is the school’s Drama Club President, and is also a programming guru.
Anver is a big thinker. He believes that STEM related advances are accelerating at a speed that frankly scares him. But instead of shying away from these advances he wants to be part of it. Jayasekera is a master of coding and imagines herself in a job that allows her to pursue Artificial Intelligence.
More than 160 nations have registered to participate in the event, with each nation represented by one school robotics team. First Global will bring together high school students from all over the world to challenge these future STEM (Science Technology Engineering and Maths) leaders to think of STEM rooted solutions to global challenges. The inaugural challenge involves designing, constructing and programming a robot which will be able to differentiate between clean and dirty water and ultimately provide access to clean and potable water.
Team Sri Lanka’s travel expenses will be covered by Virtusa Corporation. Virtusa Corporation, Co-Founder, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Krishan A. Canekeratne and the first Head Boy of CIS appointed by Moir within months of her first coming to Sri Lanka in 1982, stated in a press release that they are honored and delighted to sponsor Team Sri Lanka in the international Robotics Olympiad.
“ The enthusiasm, intellectual curiosity and highly-refined problem-solving skills these students bring to the world of robotics is truly inspirational.
These future technology leaders and STEM enthusiasts will be demonstrating thought leadership as it relates to the cleanliness of water on a world stage, setting an example to young and old alike, that together, we can find solutions to the problems that affect each and every one of us on the planet,” he further stated.
For the students representing Sri Lanka in the first iteration of the FIRST Global Challenge, this experience is an opportunity to share their knowledge and accomplishments, and those of their country with the world.
This year’s event will not only provide an opportunity for students around the world to learn and discover more about the exciting world of robotics, but will also teach them the value of teamwork and the importance of gaining the trust of their peers, regardless of their place of origin, creed, religion or race.
