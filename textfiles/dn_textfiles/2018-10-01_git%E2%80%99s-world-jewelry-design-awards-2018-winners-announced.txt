GIT’s World Jewelry Design Awards 2018  Winners Announced

The winners of GIT’s World Jewelry Design Awards 2018 were presented with their prizes at a ceremony held by the Gem and Jewelry Institute of Thailand (Public Organization) or GIT at the 62ndBangkok Gems and Jewelry Fair on September 7that IMPACT Muang Thong Thani, Bangkok.
The 12th edition of the international jewelry design contest was held under the theme of ‘The Pearl of Wisdom—Illumination from under the Surface. The winning design is entitled “ARISE” by Supatchana Limwongse from Thailand.
“The design concept is about the beauty of the moon, women and pearls which arise at the right time. The moon which gradually reveals its luminosity again after being concealed by the shadow of the earth or a lunar eclipse is like women’s charm: unperceivable with a quick glance, but with a mindful gaze,” Limwongse said. “Similarly, pearls’ beauty requires time for creation.”
The first runner-up was the owner of the design entitled “The Blooming of Wisdom”, Indika Wijayarathna from Saudi Arabia. The designer was inspired by the symbolic meaning of a pearl.
“A pearl symbolizes purity, wisdom, generosity, integrity and loyalty of its wearer,” the designer talked about his inspiration. “Meanwhile, we must have an intention to grow like a lotus in a lake, which slowly opens its petal one by one.”
Kitisak Maicharoen from Thailand won the second runner-up prize with his design entitled “ATOM”
“Before the existence of living things on earth, there were only atoms of elements combined as different substances,” Maicharoen explained the concept of his design.
In addition to the awards from the decision of honorary judges, GIT invited the public to vote for the Popular Design Award 2018, of which the winning design is entitled “Magic of Pearl” by Noppadon Mahoran from Thailand. He said the design was inspired by the interdependence and colors of pearl oysters, corals, and many more, which transform the sea atmosphere into another enchanting world of marine lives.
In this competition, winners received a total of USD 9,000 in prize money and a trophy from Princess Chulabhorn Mahidol.
In this year’s contest, 333 designs were submitted, with 157 of these from Thailand and 176 from overseas. The 5 designs that received the highest scores in the second round were made into jewelry pieces and were exhibited at the 62nd Bangkok Gems & Jewelry Fair from September 7 to 11, 2018.
