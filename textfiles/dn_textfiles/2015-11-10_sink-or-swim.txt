Brangelina’s ‘vanity project’ ‘By The Sea’
Sink or swim ?

The first American reviews have arrived for ‘By The Sea’, the third directorial outing of Angelina Jolie Pitt (this is the actress has used her husband’s surname on a billing), which was screened at the AFI Film Festival in Hollywood last night.
Written, directed and starring Jolie Pitt, and featuring Brad Pitt opposite her, it focuses on Vanessa and Roland, a married couple who stay at a French hotel and try to get through their inability to engage and writer’s block respectively. The programme notes to the film at the AFI Film Festival said it was “inspired by European cinema and theatre of the 1960s and 1970s,” and early reviews have had trouble with the film’s slow pace and lack of incident. ‘The Hollywood Reporter’s Todd McCarthy, in the most damning of its reviews, said ‘By The Sea’ was “the kind of vanity project you don’t see much of anymore”.
Is ‘By The Sea’ Brangelina’s own version of the similarly sun-kissed ‘Swept Away’ –the notorious 2002 flop starring Madonna and directed by her then husband Guy Ritchie?
Alonso Duralde - The Wrap
“Angelina Jolie Pitt’s reputation as a competent filmmaker won’t be entirely undone by her third directorial effort, ‘By the Sea’, but neither will it be enhanced… [it] plays like an unconscious parody of [...] any number of other 1960s European dramas about beautiful people having existential crises on yachts and in villas… If ‘By the Sea’ weren’t so aggressively humorless, it might almost qualify as camp.”
Tim Gray – Variety
“After the premiere, one partygoer said, ‘Good for her, she got this movie made.’ Yes, absolutely good for her. But awards voters may feel that’s reward enough… People will love or hate the film, but it does exactly what it set out to do. All the work is commendable, including the performances by the two leads, cinematography by Christian Berger, costume design by Ellen Mirojnick and music by Gabriel Yared.”
Todd McCarthy - Hollywood Reporter
“Met with a tepid response at the opening night of this year’s AFI Film Festival, this languid piece of would-be art cinema will prove once again that even the biggest names in the world won’t draw an audience to something that, in and of itself, has no reason for being.”
Tim Grierson - Screen Daily
‘By The Sea’s decidedly languid air may keep the film from connecting with mainstream audiences, who will balk at the deliberate pacing and strong scent of ennui.
Also adding to the commercial hurdles, the movie doesn’t look likely to garner rhapsodic reviews or award-season nominations, further hampering its word-of-mouth potential.
