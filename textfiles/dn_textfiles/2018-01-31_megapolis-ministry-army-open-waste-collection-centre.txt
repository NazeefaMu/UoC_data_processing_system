Megapolis Ministry, Army open waste-collection centre

The Megapolis and Western Development Ministry, in collaboration with the Army, opened a waste-collection centre at Panagoda, earlier this week. Wastepaper, plastic and glass bottles, scrap iron and other waste materials discarded from all the camps within the Panagoda cantonment, would be collected at the centre and sent for recycling.
Speaking to the Daily News Project Head Brigadier Dinendra Thanthiriwatte said the waste collected at the centre would be collected by the Megapolis and Western Development Ministry and dispatched to their respective recycling centers.
He said however, that in future, they intend to set up a compost project at the center to recycle biodegradable waste.
