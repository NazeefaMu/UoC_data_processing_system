Threatening Additional Magistrate
Bus driver, conductor bailed out on Rs.200,000 sureties

Galle Chief Magistrate Harshana Kekeunawela released a bus driver and a conductor on a surety of Rs.200,000 each with a warning, when they were produced before him for allegedly threatening the Galle Additional Magistrate and her security police officer.
She was travelling in her official vehicle when the incident occurred.
The Magistrate further ordered to temporarily suspend the driving licence of the bus driver.
The suspects were identified as a driver and a conductor of the Sri Lanka Transport Board, Katubedda depot.
Galle Traffic Police officers, who prosecuted the suspects, told court that the driver had attempted to overtake the magistrate’s official vehicle, compelling the magistrate to take her car to the pavement to avoid a possible accident. After reaching the Galle Central Bus Stand, the driver and the conductor, with some others, had come near the magistrate’s vehicle and shouted at her and threatened the police security officer and her by kicking her car.
The case was fixed for December 10.
The Magistrate instructed court officials to hand over the bus to the officer who represented the SLTB.
