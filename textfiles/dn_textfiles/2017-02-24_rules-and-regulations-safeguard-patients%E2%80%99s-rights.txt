Rules and regulations to safeguard patients’s rights

More rules and regulations will be brought to safeguard the rights of patients. The majority of Sri Lankans suffer from mental stress. It is one of the main reasons for increasing Non Communicable Diseases (NCDs), Health Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne said.
The minister made these observations after opening the web site of `Mahajana Suwadhana' Exhibition' to be held from July 14 to 16 at the BMICH in Colombo.According to the minister, he has paid special attention towards patients' rights and doctors' ethics. Rules and regulations have stipulated 10 minutes as the minimum consultation time for a patient.
Dr. Senaratne said if the rules and regulations are not implemented, consultant doctors examine patients similar to the way electric meters do. A doctor's maximum consultation charge has been limited to Rs. 2,000, he said. After performing a surgery, the doctor should stay with the patient for at least an hour. The number of consultants should be increased to the level of the consultants of foreign countries, the minister said.
A Cabinet proposal will be submitted to increase taxes on sugar, salt and fat to protect the people from NCDs. Diseases such as dengue and HIV/AIDS need to be controlled, the minister said.
