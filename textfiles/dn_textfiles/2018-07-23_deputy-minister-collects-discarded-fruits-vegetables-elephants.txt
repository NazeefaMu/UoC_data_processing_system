Deputy Minister collects discarded fruits, vegetables for elephants

Wildlife Deputy Minister Palitha Thewarapperuma arrived at the Dambulla Economic Centre around 3 am yesterday and took away the discarded fruits and vegetables to feed elephants at the Horowpothana Elephant Protection Centre.
The Deputy Minister was accompanied by the Mayor of Dambulla Jaliya Opatha. The Minister separated fruits and vegetables consumed by elephants and took them away in vehicles of the Department of Wildlife.
He discarded polythene, plastic and paper material before loading the fruits and vegetables to the vehicles. The Minister said the Horowpothana Elephant Protection Centre holds highly dangerous elephants captured from various parts of the country and feeding them at one place may help tame the animals.
The minister said it will prevent elephants from escaping breaking the electric fence around the centre in search of food.
He said the Department will often bring food for the elephants at the centre.
