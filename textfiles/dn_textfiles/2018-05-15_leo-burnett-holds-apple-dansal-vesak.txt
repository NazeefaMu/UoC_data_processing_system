Leo Burnett holds apple dansal for Vesak

Leo Burnett Sri Lanka, recently celebrated Vesak, by hosting its iconic apple dansal on Bauddhaloka Mawatha for the eighth consecutive year.
In the spirit of the cultural and religious festival, Burnetters came together to set up a colourful mural comprising 6,000 apples, which were then distributed to members of the local community and passers-by.
The dansal was headed by a cross-section of team members from diverse backgrounds and partners that all came together to ensure the distribution of apples throughout the night.
Commenting on this year’s Vesak celebrations, Arosha Perera CEO, Leo Burnett Sri Lanka said, “This year, our team came together once again, to continue our long-standing tradition of hosting a creative apple dansal for Vesak. Apples are an important symbol in our agency’s history, which spans across 83 years.”
“Apples symbolize Leo Burnett’s positive attitude and disposition. When he set up an ad agency in the height of the Great Depression in Chicago- many joked that he would have to close his doors and sell apples for a living. Leo however with his “reach for the stars” mindset and resilience, built one of the most iconic agencies of its time, despite the challenges he faced.”
“Apples have welcomed visitors to every Leo Burnett office around the world, and anyone is welcome to take one at any time. We are pleased to have been able to continue participating in annual Vesak festivities, in a way that honours an integral part of our agency’s narrative and legacy.”
