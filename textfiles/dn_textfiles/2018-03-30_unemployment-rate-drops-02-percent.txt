Unemployment rate drops by 0.2 percent

Sri Lanka's unemployment rate had dropped from 4.2 percent, which was recorded during the third quarter of last year, to four percent, which was recorded during the year's fourth quarter, the Census and Statistics Department announced yesterday.
The unemployment rate in the same quarter of the previous year was also 4.2 percent, according to government data.
The Census Department defines employed as those who worked at least one hour as paid employees, employers, own-account workers or contributing family workers, during the week the data was collected.
But almost 70 percent of employed Sri Lankans, the survey found, work more than 40 hours a week. Statistics show that the majority of employed people, or about 45 percent, are engaged in the Services sector. Twenty-eight percent of employed people work in the Industry sector, while 27 percent work in the Agriculture sector.
Of the working population, 64 percent are men, while 36 percent are women.
