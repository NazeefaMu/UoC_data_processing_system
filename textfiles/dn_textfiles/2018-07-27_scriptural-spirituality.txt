Scriptural spirituality

Dawn breaks in Thailand. A wave of orange sweeps over the entire country as monks from all over leave their monasteries and depart for their daily alms round. This scene has attracted more and more Westerners towards a closer glimpse of the lifestyle of a Thai Buddhist monk. Spending time in a monastery during your visit to Thailand can allow such an experience, and in fact is one of the greatest times one has in the country. Walking into any monastery for the first time means leaving your old world behind in exchange for new, far different one. No cell phone... No laptop... No iPod. This is a good thing.
That experience is embedded in one of the two books published by the renowned scholar, Chamika Munasinghe titled Sithe Vismitha Haskam (authored by Tilaka Kudahetti).
The other book titled Soma Himi Nam Divya Puthraya is authored by Chamika Munasinghe. Kudahetti’s book deals with several meditative experiences of the Thai Buddhist monks living in the forest. Have you ever wondered about the hidden and mysterious lives of monks? What do they do during the day? How do they live their lives? What activities and rituals do they perform in their daily routines? Now is your chance to not only take a peek into the hidden lives of monks, but also to participate and build merit as they do.
Munasinghe’s book is centred on the late Venerable Gangodawila Soma Thera’s life and his legacy. Venerable Gangodawila Soma Thera was born in Gangodawila, a semi-urban locality in the outskirts of the capital city of Colombo.
Soma Thera was ordained as novice in 1974 when he was 26 years of age under the tutelage of two of the most revered monks in Sri Lanka – Most Reverend Venerable Madihe Pannasiha Maha Nayake Thera and Venerable Ampitiye Rahula Maha Thera. He received training at the Bhikkhu Training Centre, Maharagama – an institution established by the monks mentioned above.
Having obtained his higher ordination in 1976, Some Thera continued to study the Buddhist texts in Pali, their original language, according to Theravada tradition. He was particularly interested in doing research into the teachings of the Buddha and have written several books on the subject.
He saw his mission to mould the younger generation to live according to the Dhamma. He rallied round him a youth organisation called Tharunu Saviya ("Strength of the Youth").
A keen student of meditation, he took time off to be in solitude in distant, lonely locations. His interest in meditating on the qualities of the Buddha made him work on an exhaustive study on the subject. His published work Buddhastupa is a useful guide to those interested in such meditation. Soma Thera's links with Victoria (Australia) dates back to 1986, when he was invited by some Sri Lankans to spend time preaching the Dhamma. After six months he returned to Sri Lanka. When he came back in 1989, the groundwork had been done to set up the Buddhist Vihara Victoria. The two books are available at Sahitha Poth Piyasa premises, 717/1 (near Ananda College) on May 27 at 10 am. The copies will be available with the author’s signature.
