Can Antonians turn tables on favourite Royal?

Singer ‘A’ Division inter-schools league rugby:
Royal College Colombo will be at full strength and go as favourites when they take on St. Anthony's
College Kandy in their Singer ‘A’ Division inter-schools league rugby first round final encounter at the Royal Sports Complex, Reid Avenue at 4.15pm today.
The Reid Avenue boys, one of the strongest contenders this year for the Singer league will be out for their fifth win when they meet the wounded Antonians who lost their way from the beginning of the season.
Royal coached by former Isipathana old boy Sanath Martis, should have things their own way in this encounter.
Fly half Ovin Askey will lead the Royal outfit who will have Nikhil George, Shabith Feroz, Hamza Reeza, Ganindu Dilshan and Lennox Calyanaratne - the key players in the side to pull this game through with a victory. Meanwhile the Antonians coached by old boy Viper Gunaratne will be out for their third win this season to keep their chances alive to move forward and get into round 2 Cup segment when they lock horns with second placed Royal.
St.Anthony's lost two games within close margins to St. Peter’s (25-27), Isipathana (35-43) and lost to the Joes (11-24) before coming from behind to beat Dharmaraja (34-24) in their last outing.
They will heavily depend on their skipper cum centre Dinuk Amarasinghe, Jehan Seelagama, Kavinda Amarakoon “Amare” and Samuel Maduwantha in this tense battle to bring an all important win for them.
No doubt that Maduwantha’s kicking boot has played a major role in bringing them many victories in this year’s ongoing league tournament, but we reliably learn this match winner will be unfortunately a doubtful starter for today due to a serious injury occurred against Dharmaraja last week, where he was carried off the field on a stretcher.
TWO OTHER MATCHES TODAY
