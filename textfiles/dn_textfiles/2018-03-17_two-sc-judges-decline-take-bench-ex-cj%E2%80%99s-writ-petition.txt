Two SC Judges decline to take bench on ex-CJ’s writ petition

Two Supreme Court Judges among a three-judge-bench on Thursday declined to sit on the Bench regarding the writ petition filed challenging the Bribery Commission's decision to file a corruption case in the Colombo Chief Magistrate’s Court against former Chief Justice Mohan Peiris and two others.
When the writ petition came up before the Supreme Court three-judge-bench headed by Chief Justice Priyasad Dep, two other judges Justice Buwaneka Aluvihare and Justice Nalin Perera declined to sit on the bench regarding the writ petition citing personal reasons. This petition will be taken up again on May 14.
The Supreme Court had issued an Interim Order preventing the Bribery Commission's Director General from taking further steps against former Chief Justice Mohan Peiris in the Colombo Chief Magistrate’s Court.
Meanwhile, the Bribery Commission had also filed an application in the Supreme Court seeking an order suspending the operation of the SC Interim Order dated February 26, preventing the Bribery Commission's Director General from taking further steps against former Chief Justice Mohan Peiris in the Colombo Chief Magistrate’s Court.
On January 18, the Bribery Commission filed a corruption case in the Colombo Chief Magistrate’s Court against the former Chief Justice and former Attorney General Mohan Peiris, Court of Appeal Judge A.H.M.D. Nawaz and former Secretary to the Ministry of Power and Energy M.M.C. Ferdinando.
This was over an allegation that they conferred a wrongful or unlawful benefit, and favour or advantage on the perpetrators who had been accused of misappropriating funds belonging to the Lanka Electricity Company (Private) Limited (LECO).
