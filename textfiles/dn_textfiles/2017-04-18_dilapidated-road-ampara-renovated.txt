Dilapidated road in Ampara renovated

The road in a dilapidated condition in Addalaichenai was renovated as a carpet road after many years, with the utmost effort taken by Provincial Health Minister A.L.M. Nazeer.
He visited the site recently to solve the prevailing dispute to continue another part of the road.
