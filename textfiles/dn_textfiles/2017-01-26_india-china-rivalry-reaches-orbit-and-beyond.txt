India-China rivalry reaches into orbit and beyond

 
A new space race is underway in Asia, with China and India dueling for dominance while other countries make leaps of their own. National pride and defense are major motivators, but so are practical considerations -- generating income from satellite launches, mitigating natural disasters and monitoring crops. By establishing a presence in Earth's orbit, and perhaps the expanse beyond it, governments and companies aim to ensure prosperity on the ground.
After India's decision in November to scrap its largest bank notes, the picture on the back of the new 2,000-rupee replacement bill was surely the last thing on the minds of cash-strapped citizens. The image, though, highlights a major national achievement and emphasizes the country's highest aspiration: to secure its place among the stars.

The note features a picture of India's Mangalyaan probe, Asia's first successful Mars orbiter. Launched in November 2013, the craft traveled around 670 million km and began circling the red planet the following September. Prime Minister Narendra Modi lauded the mission in a televised address. "History has been created," he said. "We have dared to reach out into the unknown and have achieved the near impossible."
Of course, India is hardly alone up there. Regional rival China in 2003 became only the third nation in history to achieve manned spaceflight, after the former Soviet Union and the U.S. Just as the 20th-century space race pitted those Cold War enemies against each other, a 21st-century race is picking up in Asia, with New Delhi and Beijing doing some serious jockeying.
The broad goals of enhancing national defense and gaining international prestige remain powerful motivators for reaching skyward. But Asian countries also have specific, diverse and practical ambitions: to develop their own high-speed communications infrastructure, to explore for natural resources, to mitigate natural disasters and to snag satellite launch contracts from other nations.

In December, Indians saw just how valuable their space program can be. As Cyclone Vardah bore down on the southern state of Tamil Nadu, the India Meteorological Department used data from the country's weather satellites to project the storm's path. This prompted the evacuation of more than 10,000 people, saving untold lives.
Not a few Indians take advantage of the country's satellites every time they turn on the TV. Tata Sky, a direct-to-home satellite TV company launched in 2006 by Tata Group and 21st Century Fox, is capitalizing on entertainment demand among the growing middle class, providing more than 400 channels. It has a contract with the Indian Space Research Organization (ISRO) to use INSAT-4A, a national satellite system; it began 4K telecasts in January 2015.
We have liftoff
India's first satellite launch with its own rocket came in 1979. It has since sent up 142 satellites aboard 59 rockets, including launches commissioned by other countries and unsuccessful attempts. The pace has picked up in recent years, with 75 satellites launched on 24 missions since 2012.
The business of launching satellites for other countries is flourishing. The ISRO has so far handled 79 satellites for 21 nations, including the U.S., Japan, Canada, Algeria and Indonesia.

In any case, the program hit a turning point in December 2014, when India fired off a prototype of the Geosynchronous Satellite Launch Vehicle Mark III -- a large, advanced rocket that can carry a payload of 8 tons into low Earth orbit and 4 tons into a high-altitude geostationary transfer orbit. The maximum payload is 60% greater than that for the GSLV-MK-II, previously India's largest rocket in service.
Demand for communications, broadcasting, weather and Earth resources satellites is rapidly growing in emerging countries, where millions are signing up for cellphones and disaster preparedness is an ever-present challenge. "Many countries, like South Korea and Saudi Arabia, are trying to launch their own satellites," noted Y.S. Rajan, honorary distinguished professor at the ISRO. "With the GSLV-MK-III, India will be able to meet the requirements."

Recent missions have shown the world what India can do. Last June, it launched 20 satellites in one go -- a national record. In September, it pulled off the feat of launching eight satellites into two different orbits. The ISRO is now preparing to launch 82 satellites in one mission. That would be a world record.
Low-cost launches are India's forte. The mission to Mars made this clear: Launching the Mangalyaan cost $74 million, about one-ninth the cost of the Maven, an American Mars probe. The difference was thanks to domestic production, downsizing of parts and the decision to limit the equipment and functionality.
The Mangalyaan project also shows India harbors ambitions far beyond simply putting satellites in orbit. It plans to follow up by launching a Mangalyaan-2 Mars probe in 2018.
Manned space missions are another possibility. The launch of the Mark III prototype in December 2014 carried an unmanned crew module, which re-entered the atmosphere and splashed down in the Bay of Bengal, as designed. Another leap came last May, when India launched and recovered its Reusable Launch Vehicle -- a craft that resembles the Space Shuttle.
With the backing of Modi and other officials, the organization's budget has been increasing steadily. And engineers who once might have sought jobs in information technology are turning their gaze to the heavens. Some influential voices, however, question the wisdom of chasing national prestige. "People prefer having rice to eat," Rajan said. "A space program involves an enormous cost."
Last year, ISRO Chairman A.S. Kiran Kumar said a manned mission "is not a priority at all."
"Our priority," Kumar stressed, "is to build capacity for new [satellite] launches."
Rather than trying to compete in manned spaceflight -- a field in which China has a head start -- it may be more realistic for India to focus on higher-performance satellites and probes. Either way, the country's space program bears watching.
