Over 3,000 tanks in A’pura run dry

As the drought continues, officials warn that close to 3,000 small and large scale tanks out of 3,226 tanks in the Anuradhapura
district have dried up. The remaining tanks have had their water levels reduced by 90-97 percent. The dire situation has caused
difficulties to many in the district to meet their daily water requirements.
