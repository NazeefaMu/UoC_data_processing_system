No state reps in Mihin Lanka Board in 2010

Eventhough state funds were invested in Mihin Lanka, there had been no state representation in the airline board to hold liability for such funding by 2010.
This disclosure was made before the Presidential Commission investigating alleged fraud, corruption and misappropriation of state funds and assets at the hearing held at the BMICH yesterday.
It was also revealed that the three directors who represented the government in Mihin Lanka had resigned in 2008 and these three vacancies had been filled with the appointment of three businessmen Raja Edirisuriya, Sarath de Silva and Hemalal Thalagashewa.
The earlier board members who represented the government had been former Defence Secretary Gotabhaya Rajapaksa, President Mahinda Rajapaksa's Coordinating Secretary Sajin Vaas Gunawardene and former Secretary to the President Lalith Weeratunge. They had resigned on May 29 and May 30 2008.
This disclosure was made by the Registrar of Companies, Nihal Ranjan Siriwardena in his evidence before the commission on cross examination by Additional Solicitor General Neil Unamboowe.
In answer to a question posed by member of the Commission, retired Appeal Court Judge A.G.R. Amarasekara, the witness said the new board members appointed to Mihin Lanka in 2010 were Kapila Chandrasena, Attorney Chandana Liyanapatabedi, Mahesh de Vaas Gunawardena and Gamini Abeyratne.
There was no record to say that any one of these new board members represented the Treasury.
