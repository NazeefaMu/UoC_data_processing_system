Piyasena Gamage to replace Geetha?

 
Piyasena Gamage is next in line to be appointed to the Parliamentary seat of Geetha Kumarasinghe, but she can appeal to the Supreme Court against the judgment given by the Court of Appeal, UPFA General Secretary and Fisheries and Aquatic Resources Development Minister Mahinda Amaraweera said.
Addressing a press conference held at the SLFP Head quarters in Colombo today he said that the judgment given based on the 19th amendment was passed in the Parliament with the intention of ensuring the right and place of Sri Lankan citizens living in Sri Lanka when contesting for elections and getting elected to the parliament.
Sports Minister Dayasiri Jayasekara said that MP Geetha Kumarasinghe can appeal to the Supreme Court against the judgment given by the Court of Appeal but if the Supreme Court gives the same judgment, several other MPs in the current Parliament will be disqualified to be in the Parliament as members.
