No Cabinet paper to legalise homosexuality: Rajitha

There had never been a Cabinet paper to legalise homosexuality, Minister Rajitha Senaratne said in Parliament yesterday. The minister made this observation responding to a question by MP Piyal Nishantha. He also said that that there was never a move to legalise homosexuality or prostitution but ensuring the rights of all Sri Lankans.
Nishantha said the President on Wednesday said that he threw away the Cabinet paper aimed at legalising homosexuality. “I don’t need to explain it to you but you can read the Cabinet paper clearly on your own and see,” the minister said. “The paper was to ensure that people of different sexual orientation enjoys the same rights as others.”
Nishantha said homosexuals might use the Cabinet paper as a loop hole to argue that their lifestyle was legal.
