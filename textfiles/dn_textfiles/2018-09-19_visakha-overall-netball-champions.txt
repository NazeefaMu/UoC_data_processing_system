Ladies College enter a final for the first time
Visakha overall netball champions

Visakha Vidyalaya Colombo emerged overall champions of the schools All Island netball tournament by becoming champions of the under 18 tournament and runners up of the under 20 tournament played at the Hikkaduwa Sri Sumangala school grounds yesterday.
Ladies College Colombo came up with a fine performance to emerge runners up of the under 18 tournament-the first time they have entered the final of an all island netball tournament.
Ladies College overcame Nivanthaka Chethiya College Anuradhapura and Maliyadewa Girls Collage Kurunegala in the first round to enter the semi finals and beat Girls High school Kandy in the semis to enter the final.
The success of Ladies College Netball team was due to the support and encouragement of principal Eesha Speldewinde, coach Pushpa Navaratne, teacher in charge Brenda Rajapaksa and sports co-ordinator Kamala Kulathilaka said head coach Deeptha Senerath Bandara who took great pains to mould them into a formidable team.
Holy Family Convent Kurunegala who dominated the schools netball scene during the last few years gave a disappointing display winning only the under 16 runners up title and losing to Hillwood College in the under 18 tournament and Visakha Vidyalaya in the under 20 tournament.
Ishani Madushika of Holy Family Convent, Kalutara was picked as the best player of the tournament.
