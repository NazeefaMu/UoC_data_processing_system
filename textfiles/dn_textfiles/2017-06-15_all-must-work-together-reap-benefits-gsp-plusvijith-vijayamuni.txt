All must work together to reap benefits of GSP plus:Vijith Vijayamuni

All should co-operate, negotiate and work together despite their party politics to reap the maximum benefits from the GSP plus facility to the Sri Lankan economy and save this country from the debt trap, Irrigation and Water Resources Management Minister Vijith Vijayamuni Zoysa said.
"This facility will lead to more investors coming back to Sri Lanka to invest and enjoy GSP benefits when they re-export. We will be able to take full advantage of GSP Plus if many factories are set up near ports and the airports throughout the country. We need to generate over
100,000 new jobs and 500,000 associated jobs while adopting new technology for industries. Since Sri Lanka is currently with a very unfavourable balance of payment, regaining of GSP plus
facility would vastly help in reducing deficit in balance of payments," he said.
Addressing a media briefing held in Colombo, the Minister said the opposition knows that many problems including unemployment and high inflation will be solved with the industrial revival of the country. "That is why, several protests were launched by the Opposition against the government's move to set up a Special Industrial Park near the Hambantota port. We urge the opposition members to extend their fullest support to take this country forward with the aim of
overcoming the debt burden."
"Today the Joint Opposition members are having dreams of our two parties splitting up. They think we are having several problems with regard to the Cabinet reshuffle and these problems will eventually lead to a split within the unity government. They imagine there are issues between the President and Prime Minister and the SLFP and UNP. But, there is nothing like that and we are moving forward in a very strong manner than before. However, we have proved that this unity
government is not weak and that we can overcome any obstacle. We are stable and we will definitely not fall apart. We will leave the government only after creating a strong state with a stable economy, society and politics," added Zoysa.
Sri Lanka received a number of economic and development benefits through the official visits of President Maithripala Sirisena to many countries in the recent past. The President visited Australia, India, Pakistan and China which has resulted in the commencement of new chapters in bilateral relations between those countries. “The people of Sri Lanka will be benefited by the results of the successful discussions he had with leaders of those countries with the objective
of gaining economic and trade assistance required by Sri Lanka. The country will receive a high level of cooperation in the field of education, political, economic, cultural, consular, legal
and defence. Many MoUs were signed to fight against terrorism, training Security Forces, granting scholarships for students involved in higher education, enhancing maritime security and prevention of Chronic Kidney Disease. Agreements were also signed to drag many investments to Sri Lanka particularly in the sectors of pharmaceuticals and medical devices, cement, sugar, IT and tourism," he added.
He said the international community has a greater understanding of the government’s commitment in marching towards a path to strengthen democracy, independence of the judiciary, respect for the rule of law and ensuring that all communities in Sri Lanka enjoy the dividend of peace which has dawned in the country. The western countries were on the verge of imposing economic sanctions on Sri Lanka, he said due to the weakness of the previous government in handling finance, economic and international relations. "We had a strong executive presidential system with unprecedented powers of controlling financial management. Bi-lateral relations between other countries were very weak. We would have faced many problems unless this
government came into power in 2015. Since then, Sri Lanka has been on a course of democratic transition resulting in improving the protection of human rights which finally met international expectations. Now, the government is winning the hearts and minds of the international community. That is why we regained many benefits like the GSP plus facility,” he added.
