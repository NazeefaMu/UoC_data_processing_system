Kavindana stars as Wesley edges out Isipathana 22-17

Young wing three quarter Kavindana Perera scored two superb tries which enabled Wesley College to edge out favourites Isipathana College by 22 points (3 tries, 2 conversions, 1 penalty) to 15 (2 tries, 1 conversion, 1 penalty) in their President trophy Milo ‘A’ Division inter-schools knockout rugby quarterfinal match played at Sugathadasa Stadium yesterday. At half time the score read 10-8 in favour of Wesley.
Isipathana staged a spirited performance in the latter stages of the second half scoring a converted try to equal the score 15-all but it was too late for them to turn tables to make it into victory as Wesley’s co-winger Mahanandas Paranthiran’s try was converted successfully by Murshid Doray who also made the first conversion and put over a penalty.
For Isipathana their second row forward Chamod Sandaruwan and centre Manula Ratnayake scored the tries. Captain cum co-centre Manelka Ruberu slotted in the conversion as well as the solitary penalty.
Referee - Rohan Fernando
