Citizens’ Mail

Request for transparency of new constitution
As a citizen of Sri Lanka, I sincerely feel that the draft of new constitution must be exposed to public transparency in order to confirm the guarantee of the rights and concessions to the majority and minority communities.
The main objectives of the new constitution must be the legal safeguards to the minorities in using their mother tongue as the medium of education and communication in the country without any discrimination. In the mean time, the children of the minority communities must be provided with all the facilities in education from primary level to university level just as the children of the majority community are provided by the state.
The new constitution should guarantee the use of the language of the minorities in official correspondence without thrusting Sinhala only in dealing with them.
It is disheartening to note that in spite of Government language policy, all official letters are sent in Sinhala only. It is unfair to the users of Tamil language as their mother tongue. Hence new constitution should reform the public administrative system with official correspondence in three languages - Sinhala, Tamil and English.
Thus, the new constitution should guarantee the free practice of any religion without the interference of others who may try to control other religions and cultures with communal feelings. Such acts of prejudice must be punishable according to new constitution. Thus the comprehensive new constitution must submit a draft to each religious and linguistic body for perusal before it is implemented as a constitutional law.
Every educated intellectual must be given an opportunity of studying the draft before it is unanimously accepted by the deserving section of the citizens.
