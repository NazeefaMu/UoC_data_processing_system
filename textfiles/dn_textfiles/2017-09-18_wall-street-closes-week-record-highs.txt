Wall Street closes  week at  record highs

US markets climbed to new records on Friday, shrugging off weak economic data that was attributed to recent hurricanes.
The rally came despite another missile test by North Korea and a terrorist attack in London, extending Wall Street’s remarkable rise this year.
Gains at Boeing, Verizon and Apple contributed to Friday’s increase, with most sectors ending the day higher.
The Dow Jones increased 64.86 points or 0.3% to close at 22,268.34. The wider S&P 500 index topped 2,500 points, adding 4.61 or 0.18%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq also rose 0.3%, adding or 19.39 points to 6,448.47.
The three major stock indexes have advanced steadily this year, gains analysts say are backed by strong corporate earnings and an improving global economy.
The Nasdaq is up more than 18% since the start of the year, with the S&P 500 up 12% and the Dow ahead 10%.
Shares in Apple helped buoy the index on Friday, rising 1% after having slid for several days. BBC News
