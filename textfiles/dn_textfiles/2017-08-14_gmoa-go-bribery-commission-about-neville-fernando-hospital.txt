GMOA to go to Bribery Commission about Neville Fernando Hospital

 
The Government Medical Officers' Association (GMOA) will make a formal complaint with the Commission to Investigate Allegations of Bribery and Corruption (CIABOC) in connection with the alleged financial fraud and misuse of public property that had taken place with the taking over of the Dr. Neville Fernando Hospital, GMOA Secretary Dr. Haritha Aluthge said.
Addressing a press conference at the GMOA Head Quarters in Colombo today he said that in addition to lodging a complaint with the CIABOC, the GMOA would also make formal complaints to the Attorney General’s Department, the Auditor General’s Department, with the Committee on Public Enterprises (COPE) and the IGP.
The Neville Fernando Teaching Hospital was taken over by the government on July 17 as part of government-sponsored measures to mitigate growing resentment by local university students who were insisting the private medical college is closed.
