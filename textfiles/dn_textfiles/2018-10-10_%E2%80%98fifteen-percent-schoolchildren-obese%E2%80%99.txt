‘Fifteen percent of schoolchildren obese’

Fifteen percent of Sri Lankan schoolchildren are obese and most are addicted to sugar, Director of the Non-Communicable Diseases Unit of the Health Ministry Dr. Thilak Siriwardana said yesterday.
Sugar is an addictive stronger than cocaine, he said, at a press conference at the Health Promotion Bureau in Colombo.
Dr. Siriwardana said that an individual should consume six teaspoons (30 grams) or less of sugar daily, but schoolchildren and adults in Sri Lanka are addicted to sugar and consume a lot more than this recommended level. It can lead to many health issues such as diabetes and other non-communicable diseases (NCDs).
According to Dr. Siriwardana, over 70 percent of deaths in Sri Lanka occur due to NCDs and there are four main factors which cause NCDs: smoking, consuming alcohol, leading a sedentary lifestyle and consuming sugar, salt and fat (oil) over the recommended levels.
A 330ml sweet drink with a red label contains six to nine teaspoons of sugar which is a large quantity. In addition, these drinks contain caffeine which causes kidney stones, tooth decay, sleeplessness, and mental stress, he said.
A short video film competition on the theme ‘Bitter Sugar’ has been organised by the NCD Unit of the Health Ministry among schoolchildren with the coordination of the Education Ministry. Each video should be of five minutes’ duration and only schoolchildren and school staff can take part in the production.
Either a video camera or a mobile phone camera can be used to shoot the film. Valuable prizes will be awarded for the winners of the competition.
The closing date for the applications is October 15 and the closing date for handing over videos is October 26. The closing dates will be extended if necessary. More details can be obtained by calling 0012669599 during office hours, he said.
