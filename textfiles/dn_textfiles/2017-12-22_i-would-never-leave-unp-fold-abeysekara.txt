I would never leave the UNP fold: Abeysekara

Puttalam District UNP Parliamentarian and Chilaw Electorate UNP Chief Organiser Shantha Sisira Kumara Abeysekara said he would never leave the UNP fold any day.
He debunked as false the rumours that he had resigned from the UNP to join the SLFP spread by certain opponents. He was addressing a press conference at his residence.
Addressing a press conference held at his residence, Abeysekara said former Chilaw UC Chairman Hillary Prasanna Fernando, who crossed over from the SLFP to the UNP during the run up to the last General Elections, was defeated when he contested in the Puttalam district from the UNP ticket. This time, he planned to contest in the UC election on the UNP ticket and asked for a written undertaking to name him as the Mayoral candidate. When he conveyed this request to the party leader, he said no one contesting elections will be nominated as Mayor or Chairman as a matter of policy before the election.
When this was conveyed to Hillary Prasanna Fernando, he left the UNP and returned to the SLFP fold, failing to realise that this is an election conducted on a ward basis. There was no need for anyone to panic or get exited with Hillary Fernando's decision because it amounted to a homecoming for a former SLFP member, he added.
