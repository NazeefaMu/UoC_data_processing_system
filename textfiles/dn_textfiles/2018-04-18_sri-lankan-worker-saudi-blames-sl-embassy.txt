Sri Lankan worker from Saudi blames SL embassy

A Sri Lankan worker arrived back to the country from Saudi Arabia on Tuesday and made various allegations to the Sri Lankan embassy in Saudi Arabia for sending her without any clothes except the Abaya.
The worker who was identified as Durayalage Yanawathi had lived in Saudi for 18 years and was suffering from blindness.
“The news portrayed by some media outlets which state that the worker was brought to the country with only an Abaya is completely false. She was brought through the Sri Lankan embassy in Saudi Arabia following correct protocols,” said an official of Sahana Piyasa which acts as the Welfare Centre to the Sri Lanka Bureau of Foreign Employment.
The official said that the worker came in a way that any worker would come from a Middle East country. “She came with the Muslim attire along with the Abaya which is the normal way of arrival.
We then contacted the police and took measures to find her relatives and we dropped her off to her relatives in Kurunegala during the day,” she further said.
“Yanawathi was examined by the airport doctors who stated that long term medications could cure all of her illnesses. We would further stay in touch with her and constantly assess her situation,” the official said.
