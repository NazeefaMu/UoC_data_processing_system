Anti-graft code of conduct for corporate sector

The Bribery Commission will soon introduce a code conduct for the corporate sector amending the existing laws, Bribery and Corruption Commission's Director General, Dilrukshi Dias Wickramasinghe said
Speaking at a breakfast forum organised by Shipper's Academy Colombo at Hotel Galadari she said that we must also make private companies liable if they are involved in bribery and corruption.
She said that bribery and corruption also takes place among private companies as well. The Director General said said that she was pleased to say that almost all multi-nationals and top corporates do not get involved in corruption. She recalled that she personally knew of an instance where Hemas Holdings destroyed a consignment of Bio Oil mid sea since a Customs officer wanted a huge bribe to clear it.
She said that she will also look at the Customs Ordinance as she has received many complaints that tougher legislation is needed to reduce corruption in that institution.
Wickramasinghe said that today some are afraid to come out and expose corruption since they think that they will be harassed by authorities and in courts. "This is a myth. What you just got to do is to dial 1954 and just give us a detailed account and we will follow it up from there."
Speaking to 'Daily News Business' she said that her officials are every honest but they need to think newly. "For this we are obtaining the services of two officials from US and UK with the assistance of their Embassies in Sri Lanka."
She also said that Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayake too is backing her and has allocated Rs. 500 million to strengthen the Commission. The UNDP too has offered us funds as they feel corruption should be not reduced but eliminated.
