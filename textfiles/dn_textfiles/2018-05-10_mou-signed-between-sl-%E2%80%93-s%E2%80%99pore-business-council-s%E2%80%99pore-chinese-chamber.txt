MoU Signed between SL – S’Pore Business Council & S’Pore Chinese Chamber  of Commerce & Industry

In keeping with the momentum of increased trade and investment between Sri Lanka and Singapore, a Memorandum of Understanding between the Sri Lanka – Singapore Business Council and the Singapore Chinese Chamber of Commerce & Industry was signed recently in Colombo by the respective Presidents Shamil Mendis and Roland Ng.
An interactive evening with the delegates of the Singapore Chinese Chamber of Commerce and Industry was hosted on Tuesday evening at Cinnamon Grand by the Sri Lanka – Singapore Business Council. The Sri Lanka - Singapore Business Council inaugurated on August 14, 1997 is the 18th bilateral Business Council formed under the aegis of the Ceylon Chamber of Commerce.
The evening commenced with President of the Sri Lanka – Singapore Business Council, Shamil Mendis’, opening remarks: “The Sri Lanka Singapore Business Council works closely with International Enterprise Singapore and the Singapore Business Federation, with whom we have a MoU. With the forthcoming signing of a MoU with the Singapore Chinese Chamber of Commerce and Industry, we look forward to a strong partnership between our Chambers and membership resulting in growing trade and investment opportunities.”
Following the recent signing of the Free Trade Agreement between Sri Lanka and Singapore, a significant milestone unfolding opportunities for Sri Lanka and Singapore companies has been marked by unlocking a new era of partnership. This delegation from the Singapore Chinese Chamber of Commerce & Industry is the second largest delegation from Singapore to visit Sri Lanka since January 2018 after the signing of the FTA with Singapore. The first delegation visited in January to coincide with the visit of the Prime Minister of Singapore.
The evening concluded with a networking session which provided the opportunity for local businessmen to interact with the delegates of the Singapore Chinese Chamber of Commerce & Industry, allowing for business ties to be forged.
