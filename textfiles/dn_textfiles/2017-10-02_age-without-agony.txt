Age without agony

Ageing can bring about unique health issues. The aim of this interview with Consultant Physician Dr Lasantha Ganewatta MBBS (SL), MD (Colombo), FRCP (London), MRCP (UK), DGM (Geriatrics) (UK), MRCP-SCE (Geriatrics) (UK) is to review how health issues such as frailty affect the elders.
Q: What is Frailty?
A: Frailty is a common condition among elderly. It is a problematic expression of ageing. When people are ageing, they gradually lose their inbuilt reserves across multiple body systems. That is the simplest way of explaining frailty.
Q: How does frailty affect the elders?
A: Frail adults are more vulnerable to diseases, hospitalisations, care-home admissions and functional dependency even under minor stress. For example, a simple chest infection could cause debilitating symptoms such as severe loss of appetite, dehydration, poor balance and mobility. Kidney impairment, heart failures and disorganised psychology will surface as a result.
Prevalence of frailty increases with age. It is 10 percent among age more than 65 years.
However, it increases up to 25 percent at the age of 85 years. It is commoner among females compared to males of the same age. Further, if a person has multiple medical, social, functional and psychological problems, he is more prone to be frail irrespective of the age.
Q: What can be done to remedy those functional disabilities?
A: We engage in numerous functions from the moment of waking up until the end of the day. They include mobility, transfer, feeding, dressing, toilet use, using stairs and grooming. The ability to use telephone, shopping, housekeeping, food preparation, medication and handling finances are instrumental functions. Participating in social and family roles, recreational and occupational activities are improved functions.
Ageing restricts these functions. You can optimise the functional abilities with ageing. The elders undergo many medical concerns such as diabetes, high blood pressure, heart problems, arthritis and memory deficiency. Optimising the treatment with the best possible options is the first and foremost.
Regular exercises, especially strength and balance training, will improve the function as well as the mass of muscles and bones. However you need advice from a physician who knows your capacity and risks.
Protein-rich food, fruits and vegetables, legumes, dairy products provide calcium and vitamin D to improve the functional capacity. Identifying abilities, avoiding risk behaviour and positive thinking are also important.
If it is difficult to carry on with functions, you should inform your physician. They will examine several aspects of your health. They might refer you to a physiotherapist or an occupational therapist to assess your abilities and disabilities. You may more likely need some aids, equipment and modification of your residence to run a safe independent life.
Q: What are the main cognitive problems developed among the elders? How could they be treated?
A: There are mainly three cognitive problems common among the elders. The commonest is dementia. Alzheimer's disease and dementia are secondary to defective blood vessels in the brain. These are the common causes of memory impairment. Depression is another cognitive problem.
Only a few types of dementia have definitive treatment. For example, dementia secondary to deficient thyroid gland function is reversed with adequate doses of thyroxin hormone replacement.
However, optimum management of common diseases especially, diabetes, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol levels will prevent or delay the onset of above said common types of dementia.
Quitting smoking and alcohol, less or no stress, low fat, low-salt diet, adequate consumption of fruits and vegetables improve the mental well-being. Physical exercises, at least 150 minutes per week, will refresh your physical and psychological health. It is well proven that brain-engaging activities such as reading, calculations, family and social events actively, planning own businesses, doing puzzles and Sudoku facilitate the mental well-being.
Q: How can the elders shield themselves against numerous health issues?
A: The regular medical follow-up with good compliance to treatment for their long-term illnesses is number one. The connections with family, friends, neighbours, hospital, social service officer of the area and Grama Niladari are required in case of an emergency. Make your home environment safe.
There are island-wide village elderly committees headed by the elderly secretariat.
They engage in various activities. Even though you live alone, you can be an active member and can get some benefits. Besides, you will be entitled to a monthly allowance, home modifications, a senior citizen identity card and protect from abuse. The social service officer of your area could be contacted for more details.
Q: What is your advice to the healthy young people to avoid old-age frailty?
A: Keep up with a healthy lifestyle. Optimise your blood sugar levels, blood pressure, cholesterol levels and any medical condition with good compliance and follow-up. Quit smoking and alcohol. Work out regularly.
The strength and balance training exercises improve your mobility and stability of walking and prevent falls.
The stress-relieving habits like listening to music, dancing, meditation, engaging in religious activities, doing yoga and sharing your leisure with the loved ones are also important for both physical and psychological health.
Most elders are reluctant to accept their limitations and risks. You should be smart to identify them and adapt your lifestyle accordingly. Your home environment should be safe. A slippery floor, dark passages, cluttered furniture, unsafe electric equipment and stairs without railings are the frequent causes of domestic accidents.
