Apeksha IVF sends gynecologists for training  at Manipal University

Apeksha IVF recently succeeded in sending the first batch of consultant gynecologists on training at the Manipal Assisted Reproduction Centre (MARC), Manipal University, India.
Dr. Jayakumar and Dr. Sudath Senaratne from Sri Lanka participated at the training programme.
MARC is located at Kasturba Medical College (KMC) which is under Manipal University.
The training was conducted by Dr. Pratap Kumar, Professor and Head of MARC and Dr. Satish Kumar Adiga, Professor and Chief Embryologist of MARC.
The training programme is part of an ongoing Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) between Apeksha IVF and the Kasturba Medical College, Manipal University.
Apeksha IVF intends on sending many more future batches for training in India.
The MoU includes the following:
l Training and awareness for clinicians on global standards of IVF technology and procedures.
l Training for medical laboratory technicians (MLTs) on advanced IUI procedures and theories.
l Training and providing qualifications for scientists on embryology and genetics.
l Research and Development in the field of Assisted Reproductive Technology.
l To encourage more gynecologists in providing better infertility services for sub-fertile couples so that Sri Lanka will have global technology and expertise for Sri Lankan patients at an affordable price.
l To discourage Sri Lankan patients seeking treatment overseas and thereby retain foreign exchange in the country.
l To attract more health tourism from countries like Maldives, Nepal, Pakistan and Bangladesh.
