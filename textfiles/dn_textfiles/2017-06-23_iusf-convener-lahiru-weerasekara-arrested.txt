IUSF convener Lahiru Weerasekara arrested

 
Inter University Students’ Federation (IUSF) Convener Lahiru Weerasekara and three others were arrested by the Police after a IUSF press conference held in Maradana today.
The IUSF created a tense situation at the Health Ministry on Wednesday by storming the ministry premises, removing name boards and burning them.
The protest was against legalizing the South Asian Institute of Technology and Medicine (SAITM) in Malabe.
On June 21, the Colombo Fort Magistrate Court issued an order to the IUSF to refrain from obstructing the public while protesting.
