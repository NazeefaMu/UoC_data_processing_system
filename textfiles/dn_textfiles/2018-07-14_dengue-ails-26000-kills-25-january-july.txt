Dengue ails 26,000, kills 25 from January to July

Dengue fever ailed <U+200B>27,591<U+200B> people and killed around 25 up to <U+200B>July 13, Epidemiology Unit sources said.
The Colombo District reported the highest number (4,935)<U+200B> and the Batticaloa District recorded the second highest (<U+200B>3,751)<U+200B>. The Gampaha District recorded the third highest, (2,457)<U+200B>, the sources said.
The Colombo Municipal Council (CMC) reported <U+200B>1,324 dengue cases during the same period. The other parts of the Colombo district recorded 3,611<U+200B> dengue cases. The Western Province recorded <U+200B>69,060 cases, the unit sources said.
The public are advised to seek treatment without delay for fever. Fever patients need rest and should not attend work or school.
They should take paracetamol only. Other medications, especially Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAID) such as Ibuprofen cause Dengue Hemorrhagic Fever (DHF), which can become fatal, they said.
People should keep their premises free of dengue mosquito breeding sites (water harbouring places) during this rainy season to prevent dengue. Even water in a pen clip or a bottle top is adequate for dengue mosquitoes to breed, the sources said.
