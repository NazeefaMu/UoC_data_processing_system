Charith Senanayake returns as manager for fourth time

Former Sri Lanka cricketer Charith Senanayake has been appointed manager of the Sri Lanka cricket team from July 25 to September 30, 2018.
Sri Lanka Cricket said that Senanayake will function as team manager till the conclusion of the Asia Cup in September.
Senanayake first took over the post in 2008 from former Sri Lankan skipper Anura Tennekoon. He was reinstated as manager for his second stint in April 2016 after he was unceremoniously sacked in February 2013.
He was again replaced as manager in December 2016 for the tour of South Africa on the grounds of a SLC rotation policy.
Senanayake will replace former Sri Lanka cricketer Asanka Gurusinha as manager. Gurusinha vacated his position as manager at the end of the tour to West Indies last month to take up a position as chief cricket operations officer in charge of SLC’s High Performance Unit and Brain Centre Operations.
