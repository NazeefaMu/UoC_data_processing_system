ADITYA WINS 2019 CONDE NAST JOHANSENS AWARD

Aditya, which has reiterated an impressive presence in the country’s luxury boutique resort hospitality space since 2005, added to its global laurels with a prestigious 2019 Condé Nast Johansens Award for Excellence in Best Luxury Value this year. This award makes Aditya the only property in Asia and the first in Sri Lanka to be crowned in this category of Best Luxury Value, by this renowned international organisation which has a global collection of luxury hotels, spas and venues approved by international hospitality experts. This latest global award adds to an impressive collective of accolades won this year including an unprecedented four TripAdvisor Travellers’ Choice Awards, placing Aditya among the Top Ten Luxury Hotels in Sri Lanka, the Top 25 Small Hotels in Sri Lanka and among the Top 25 Hotels in Sri Lanka for Service as well as Romance.
Sitting on the golden beaches of Rathgama in down south Galle, Aditya has now etched itself into the honour roll of wearing the title of one of the most unique properties in the world. The 16 suite resort replete with its newest addition this year of two luxury villas, magnificently impressive at 7,500 square feet each, articulates freedom and relaxation in its open spaces, unending seascapes and tropical vistas. Contemporary interiors marrying vignettes of historical architecture and cultural hallmarks set against polished cement floors and essays in tropical design hues, with rooms appointed with every conceivable luxurious details including private pools and even outdoor rain showers makes for a haven in R&R, a dynamic that continues to be echoed with each award presented.
