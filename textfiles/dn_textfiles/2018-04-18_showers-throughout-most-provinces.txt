Showers throughout most provinces

The Meteorology Department predicted more showers and thundershowers in most provinces during afternoon hours over the next few days.
Showers or thundershowers would occur in most provinces, particularly in the Western, Sabaragamuwa, Southern, Central, North Western and Uva provinces after 2 pm, the Meteorology Department said. Showers or thundershowers would occur in the coastal areas of the Southern Province and the Ampara district in the morning as well.
Fairly heavy falls (above 75mm) could be expected at some places, particularly in the Western and Southern Provinces, the Department added. Misty conditions could also be expected in some regions of the Sabaragamuwa and Central Provinces in the morning.
There may be temporary, localised strong winds during thundershowers. The public is requested to take adequate precautions to minimise damages caused by lightning.
