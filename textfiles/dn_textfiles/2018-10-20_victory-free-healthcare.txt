Victory for free healthcare

In yet another victory for Sri Lanka’s free healthcare system, a global study by the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME) has revealed that Sri Lankans will be living at least five years longer (80 years) by 2040. The present life expectancy figures are 78.5 (female) and 72.1 (male), according to World Health Organisation (WHO).
Sri Lanka is one of the few Asian countries to achieve the honour of surpassing the landmark 80 years, along with Japan (ranked second in the study at 85.7 years), Singapore (third ranked at 85.4), China, South Korea and Thailand. Spain, famous for the Mediterranean diet of its laid-back inhabitants, has topped the study with 85.7 years. Among the other countries in the top 10 are Australia, Portugal, France, Israel, Italy and Switzerland. By comparison, many developed countries including USA have been ranked below Sri Lanka. Lesotho, the Central African Republic, Zimbabwe, Somalia and Swaziland are in the bottom. For the world as a whole, the researchers projected a five-year gain in lifespan, from 73.8 in 2016 to 77.7 in 2040. This is a vindication of successive Sri Lankan Governments’ commitment to free healthcare. Even foreigners admitted to Government hospitals get free treatment. In fact, apart from the longevity factor, most other health indices for Sri Lanka are on par with those of the developed world. Our heath system has been studied and copied by many other countries in the region.
Longevity has increased practically all over the world (except perhaps in sub-Saharan Africa) thanks to advances in medicine and healthcare. In fact, scientists believe that the first person to live to 150 years has already been born somewhere in the world. Many diseases which used to be deadly, including AIDS, have been controlled successfully. Some diseases have been eradicated from our midst. WHO-led vaccination, though a controversial subject in certain countries, has saved millions of children. Surgeries are commonplace for coronary heart diseases and kidney diseases. Organ transplants are saving thousands of lives per year. Replacement of parts such as knee caps has enabled thousands of older people to lead active and healthy lives. Scientists are working on more artificial parts and organs, from hearts to eyes. Such surgeries could be common by 2040.
Even as the world has successfully grappled with communicable diseases such as TB, a bigger threat has emerged from Non-Communicable Diseases (NCDs) such as diabetes, heart disease and kidney disease. The study took a look at some of the conditions that are shortening people's lives, and projects a significant increase in deaths from NCDs including diabetes, Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease, chronic kidney disease and lung cancer. Tobacco consumption alone claims about seven million lives each year, according to WHO. The study also warns of worsening health outcomes linked to obesity, with at least 300 million people suffering from the condition already. The top five health factors that explain most of the future trajectory for premature death are high blood pressure, high body mass index, high blood sugar and tobacco and alcohol abuse. Air pollution ranked sixth. Injuries sustained as a result of motor accidents and home and workplace incidents are also likely to increase.
As the study’s lead author Kyle Foreman, head of data science at (IHME) notes “the future of the world's health is not pre-ordained” – indeed there could be positive developments that could stop these diseases dead in their tracks. A cure for cancer, the holy grail of science and medicine, alone could save millions of lives per year. Artificial lungs and hearts could also be available by 2040, which will make it easier to treat patients who need life-saving surgery.
A projected proliferation of electric vehicles by 2040 (incidentally the cut-off date for the registration of fossil fuel vehicles in many countries including Sri Lanka) and the greater use of renewable energy could drastically reduce air pollution. Fully autonomous, driverless cars are likely to cause far less accidents, thereby reducing accident injuries. There will be more effective, cheaper drugs for many diseases by 2040. As famed scientists Stephen Hawking predicts in his final essay published posthumously in the Sunday Times of London, there could be a breed of “super humans” by 2040-2050 who would use genetic engineering to get rid of disease, design perfect bodies and live to 150-200 years. This is very much in the realm of possibility.
But the biggest challenge posed by a “silver generation” world is finding productive vocations for the elderly who will still be physically and mentally fit. Many countries have already raised the retirement age to 60 or 65, but it is important to ensure that they can make productive use of time and make a contribution to the economy even after 65. Over the next 30 years the number of over-65s is expected to reach 1.3 billion, outnumbering children for the first time. Already, the number of people in the world 65 and over is increasing at an average of 870,000 each month. Governments around the world must come up with programmes that not only add years to their lives but also life to their years.
