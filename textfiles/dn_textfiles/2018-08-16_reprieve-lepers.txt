Reprieve for lepers

The Cabinet has approved amendments to the Lepers’ Ordinance 1901 to facilitate patients to engage in their social relationships.
Segregation of Leprosy patients was made compulsory by the Lepers’ Ordinance 1901. As a result of new treatments this segregation was suspended since 1983.
However, there are 31 Leprosy Patients in the Hendala and Manthivu Leprosy Hospitals still who were segregated under the 1901 Ordinance, eventhough they are cured of Leprosy.
