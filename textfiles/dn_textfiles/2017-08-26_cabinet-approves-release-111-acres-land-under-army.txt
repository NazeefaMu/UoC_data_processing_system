Cabinet approves to release 111 acres of land under Army

Security forces released 243 acres of land at Keppapilavu, Mullaitivu to their original owners on August 19. Another 189 acres were released following a payment of Rs. five million on the same day.
The consent of the Army Commander was given to release another 111 acres of private lands at Keppapilavu upon receiving Rs. 148 million to relocate army camps.
The proposal in this regard was submitted for Cabinet approval by Prison Reforms, Rehabilitation, Resettlement and Hindu Religious Affairs Minister D.M. Swaminathan recently.
The minister said the Cabinet approval was given to release Rs. 148 million to the Army Commander to relocate army buildings and equipment located in the 111 acres of land under the security forces.
He said it was planned to release the land to their original owners immediately by releasing the fund at once to the security forces once the fund was released to the Ministry from the Treasury.
