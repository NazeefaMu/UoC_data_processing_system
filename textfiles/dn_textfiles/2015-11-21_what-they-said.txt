What they said

Parliamentary Reforms and Media Minister Gayantha Karunathilake
"This is a development oriented budget that does not burden the ordinary mass. It is a far sighted strategic plan targeted at achieving medium and long term economic goals. It is one of the most successful budgets in the recent history"
Opposition Leader and TNA Parliamentary Group Leader R. Sampanthan
"It is a development oriented budget"
 
 
 
Chief Opposition Whip and JVP Leader Anura Kumara Dissanayake
"It is an illusion to think that this budget would lead the country in a new path. This is a Budget formulated to allow a handful of looters to grab the resources of this country. The economic strategies followed by this Government are outdated. The rights of the people in the country have been curtailed. This is certainly not a people friendly approach."
 
 
Technology and Research Minister Susil Premajayantha
"This budget transcends the traditional patterns followed over the past few years. It has infused more money to education and health sectors. It has given special focus on new innovations and this is commendable. As we are a middle income earning country now, we need new innovations to capture the international market."
 
 
Former President and Kurunegala District MP Mahinda Rajapaksa
"In overall the Budget was not clear, and there were many uncertainties in those proposals. For example, the proposal to allocate a staggering amount of money for each village was good, but it is doubtful how practical it is, because the Government would need trillions of rupees for that
proposal alone. The Government continues to put the blame on the previous Government, but, the time is now ripe to stop that. The Budget has dedicated several chapters to drag on the economic handling of the previous Government.
