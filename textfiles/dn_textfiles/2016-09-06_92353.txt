Sonakshi reinvents herself for ‘Akira’

Sonakshi Sinha’s movie ‘Akira’ has created quite a buzz these days for its slick action sequences. In the movie, Sonakshi is seen fighting off a pack of hoodlums and reducing them to pulp with her kicks and karate-chops.
According to Sonakshi, she started training two months before the film hit the floors. “Even when the shooting was on, I had to keep learning the judo karate kicks to make the fight scenes more convincing and gut-wrenching,’’ says the actress who is reinventing herself with this role. Sonakshi is all praise for its director AR Murugadoss for deciding to do a woman-centric film. The actress also feels that girls should have a basic knowledge of self-defence.
When asked if it was really tough doing the martial art scenes, Sonakshi says that since she had been very active in sports in her school days, it was not that difficult to pull off action scenes as it needed quick reflexes and agility. “From throwball, volleyball, basketball to swimming and discuss throw, I did everything,’’ says the actress. Doing ‘Akira’ has a special significance for Sonakshi as she feels now that women sportspersons like PV Sindhu, Sakshi Malik and Dipa Karmakar are bringing laurels for the country, it seems fitting that we celebrate the birth of a girl child in our country. After ‘Akira’, Sonakshi takes her action heroine tag forward with ‘Force 2’ where she is paired with John Abraham. According to her, the action sequences in ‘Force 2’ is more sleek and stylized not to mention some high-octane chase sequences.
