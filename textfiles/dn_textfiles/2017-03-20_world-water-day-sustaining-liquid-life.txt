World Water Day : Sustaining the liquid of life!

Wednesday will be United Nations' World Water Day. The event is held on March 22 each year. Events are organized on or around this day to increase people's awareness of water's importance in environment, agriculture, health and trade. Its aim is to remind people about the significance of fresh water and to promote sustainability for fresh water resources' management.
It’s a day to celebrate water. It’s a day to prepare for how we manage water in the future. Each year World Water Day highlights a specific aspect of freshwater. Last year’s theme was: ‘Water and jobs. Better water, better jobs.’ Today, almost half of the world's workers - 1.5 billion people - work in water-related sectors and nearly all jobs depend on water and those that ensure its safe delivery.
World Water Day celebrations in 2017 will highlight the theme ‘Waste Water.’ Climate change, population growth and economic development demand for sustainable solutions to make the world future-proof. Waste water is perceived as a valuable resource in the circular economy and its safe management is an efficient investment in the health of humans and ecosystems. Improving waste water management means improvement on all six targets of the Sustainable Development Goal on Water. Remember there is no such thing as wastewater - only water wasted.
Toda Today, almost half of the world's workers - 1.5 billion people –depend on water and those that ensure its safe delivery. Yet the millions of people who work in water are often not recognized or protected by basic labour rights. The theme in 2016 — water and jobs — is focusing on nd livelihoods - and even transform societies and economies.

Water! We drink it, wash in it, cook with it, swim in it and generally take it for granted. This clear, tasteless and odourless liquid is so much part of our lives that we hardly ever think about its amazing properties but take hardly give it a second thought unless we are denied access to it. We would die in a few days without water as 65 percent of our bodies are composed of water.
Besides slaking our thirst, water is necessary to dissolve essential minerals and oxygen, flush our bodies of waste products, and transport nutrients around the body where needed. Water is the only substance that has these properties. And it has many more fascinating features that suggest that it has been designed ‘just right’ for life.
The availability of water
Water is not only the most essential substance next to oxygen for human life. It is also complex, often containing hundreds of dissolved minerals and chemicals. Most water is also ‘structured’ or clustered in complex ways. It is indeed a remarkable substance whose extreme value is often unrecognised. And today, we are messing with it. The sheer number of human beings on Earth - seven billion, with another two billion likely by 2050 - is adding unsustainable stress to the supply and the quality of fresh water all over the globe. While water is life, the limited, and in too many cases, nonexistent, availability of clean, potable water means lingering sickness and even death for countless people in scores of countries.
Water, water everywhere, not a clean drop to drink! The old primer attributed to a ship-wrecked victim may become a terrifying reality if our precious liquid is not managed and sustained adequately. Who would have thought that there will be a day when sanitation of available water would be more of a concern than availability of water itself ?
The availability of water decides not only the number of individuals of each species that are able to survive in a particular area, but it also decides the diversity of life there. Of course, the availability of water is not the only aspect that decides the sustainability of life in a region. Other factors such as the temperature and nature of soil also matter. But water is one of the major resources which determine life on land.
A healthy planet
Many of us in Sri Lanka do not realise how fortunate we are. We simply turn on a tap when we need fresh clean water. We use this water for a variety of purposes. On average, our direct indoor water use comes to over 69 gallons of water per person per day. When you include all uses of water at home, both indoor and outdoor, a local family of four can use up to 400 gallons per day!
But spare a thought for the nearly 750 million people around the world who still have no access to clean drinking water. That is why so many people, children in particular, suffer all types of life threatening illnesses. In many parts of the undeveloped world, including Sri Lanka, women waste hours walking to fetch water from streams and waterholes rather than spending their time more productively.
It behoves us all to tell the world that responsible use of fresh water is essential for a healthy planet and human well-being. But fresh water, in turn, isn’t possible without a healthy planet. Yet human actions are putting a healthy planet at risk. After all, life on earth is maintained by water. A crisis of fresh water will be the biggest challenge to humans in the millennium.
Saving water
That is why all the world’s national authorities responsible for drinking water supplies keep stressing the importance of spreading the message that drinking water will be the most precious commodity in the world in the near future. Water means different things to each of us but one thing is for sure! It is vital for all our lives.
This is a problem that concerns us all. Water authorities everywhere are striving frantically to provide clean water, sanitation and hygiene to cover the world’s population by 2030. The goal is possible only if we all chip in and help them.
Fortunately, saving water around the house is easier today than ever before. Modern toilets, showers and faucets are designed to be more efficient and can save your household many gallons per day. For example, older toilets can use up to 6 gallons per flush, whereas newer low-flow (water-saving) toilets use from 1.6 to 3.5 gallons, and high-efficiency models even less. Similarly, regular showerheads spray nearly a gallon per minute, while low-flow models put out just over half a gallon per minute. That is why we should also consider cutting our shower time down by at least a few minutes.
No matter how you spell it or how you pronounce it, H2O is a wonder: a beautifully simple, simply beautiful element that, when all is said and done, means nothing less than life.
