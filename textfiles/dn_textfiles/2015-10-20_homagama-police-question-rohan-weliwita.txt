Rohan Weliwita, Media Secretary to the former President Mahinda Rajapaksa yesterday was summoned to the Homagama Police station to record a statement.
The Media Secretary has been informed to appear at the police station for questioning regarding the misplacement of several video footages of former President Rajapaksa's programmes at the President's Media Unit.
"The Presidential Secretariat Office had lodged a complaint against Rohan Welivita," Police Media Spokesman ASP Ruwan Gunasekara said.
The Police on Sunday had also visited Weliwita's residence at Homagama to record the statement, however he was not at home at the time, it was reported.
Weliwita has given a statement on how the channel was funded at the outset.
Meanwhile, former Rohan Welivita in a statement yesterday refuted the charges that he took away the cassettes and vedios of various meetings and events held under the patronage of former President Mahinda Rajapaksa for the past nine years. Welivita said that he was not serving at the Presidential Media Division though he was a Coordinating Secretary to the former President.
He insisted that he did not have a office nor a staff at the Presidential Secretariat or Temple Trees.
Welivita added that the video cassettes of meetings and various events held under the patronage of former President Mahinda Rajapaksa were under the care of the head of electronic media.
