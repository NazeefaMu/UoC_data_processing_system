Waters Edge begins extensive banquet expansion

Waters Edge is today a firm favourite among those who wish to tie the knot in style overlooking the scenic waters of the Diyawanna or for corporates who need the perfect venue for their next company gathering.
The versatility of the hotel is such that banquet options are multiple from individual meeting rooms to some of the biggest banquet halls in the country and even the option of large outdoor spaces.
Adding to an already extensive banquet offering, Waters Edge has commenced an extensive expansion project of the four-floor banquet facility.
Led by the ideas and efforts of Minister of Megapolis and Western Development Patali Champika Ranawaka, Chairman of Waters Edge Chamath De Silva and General Manager Rohan Fernandopulle, the groundbreaking ceremony was also attended by officials from the Urban Development Authority and Sri Lanka Land Reclamation and Development Corporation.
Speaking at the ceremony Chairman of Waters Edge Chamath De Silva said, “The expansion of the banquets facilities at Waters Edge is two-fold. On one hand, we will expand our space offering on each of the four floors. On the other hand, we are also concentrating heavily on ensuring that service delivery at banquets is enhanced as well.”
The new expansion project once completed will make the banquet facility the largest in the country that will house one of the largest banquet halls.
It will also include two guest lifts and two service lifts. This will enable service delivery to take place in a more streamlined manner.
Also speaking at the ceremony, General Manager Rohan Fernandopulle noted, “Our ultimate goal is to improve facilities for banquet guests and be known for outstanding service delivery in all areas of our operations. We also want to ensure our guests that the hotels operations will continue as usual despite the expansion project. This project is also envisioned to make operations smoother for our events and logistics partners who have come to trust us for all their events as well as for our staff who will be able to serve you better.”
Through this expansion, Waters Edge members can also enjoy added benefits to the member’s area such as luxury sauna, dedicated rooms for aerobics and zumba and so much more.
