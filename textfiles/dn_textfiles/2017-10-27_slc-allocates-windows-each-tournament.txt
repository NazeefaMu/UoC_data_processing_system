Each of 24 clubs to be paid Rs. one million for expenses
SLC allocates windows for each tournament

Sri Lanka Cricket featured some of the plans for the upcoming domestic tournament which will run for six months and has allocated windows for each and every tournament conducted on behalf of SLC.
"Every tournament has a window so that the provincial associations, clubs as well as the players would know exactly when the tournaments are coming up. This tournament calendar will be valid for the next three years" said Bandula Dissanayake chairman of the tournament committee at a press conference held at SLC on Wednesday.
“The Division three tournaments we have entrusted to the district cricket associations to conduct the preliminary rounds, the final rounds will be conducted by the provincial cricket associations where the provincial champions will be allowed to go one step ahead to the next tournament,” Dissanayake said.
“A structure has been prepared for the Premier tournament which will start around the first week of December under three segments league, ODI and T20 and it’ll be in two stages, the inter club tournament where they will play three-day matches followed by the provincial tournament where the players will play four-day matches using pink balls. The season will conclude around April or early May.”
It was also stated that Minister of Sports Dayasiri Jayasekara had appointed a committee to look into the schools cricket as well as domestic structure and to advise him on how it should conducted. The committee is headed by former Singer (Sri Lanka) chairman and former SLC interim committee chairman Hemaka Amarasuriya and former cricketers Aravinda de Silva, Mahela Jayawardene and Kumar Sangakkara.
Some of the tournament's details are subject to change, with a cricket committee appointed by the Sports Ministry adding their inputs.
“We had a very good exchange of views and as far as I know the committee has not completed the final report, but its recomandations for the betterment of the sport will be co-operated into the tournament structure immediately,” said Dissanayake.
Earlier the Premier tournament clubs played friendly matches on their own and at their own expense. He further added that SLC has taken that into account and the clubs will be given an opportunity to play friendly matches with a substantial amount of Rs. one million per club for the 24 clubs playing in the first-class tournament.
