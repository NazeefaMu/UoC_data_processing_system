Q - Define Vertigo.
A - Vertigo is an illusion of the movements. Due to this condition, the patient feels unbalanced or the environment around him rotating. Symptoms could vary from light headedness to full blown spinning attacks, vomiting or ear related problems.
Mainly Vertigo affects our balance system. Balance relies on our eyes, inner era, brain and the lower limb joints. Any type of insult to the inner ear or any related part can cause vertigo.
Causes of vertigo can vary. Mainly it is divided into two as ear related causes and brain related causes. Low sugar level in blood (hypoglycemia) and heart problems too can cause vertigo. Brain related causes such as cerebral tumors (cancers) bleeding to the brain etc are very rare. Inner ear related vertigo is very common.
Q - How is vertigo diagnosed?

A - If vertigo does not settle with medicines, the doctor will recommend a MRI scan. But the diagnosis is mainly based on the details provided by the patient such as duration, onset, associated symptoms such as vomiting and ear problems.
The doctor examines the patient properly and decides the cause. If necessary, the doctor will order an audiology testing and Brain MRI.
Q - What is the treatment process?
A - Different Vertigo types need different treatment. Sometimes hospitalization and injections are required. Medicines, ear surgery too may be required according to the condition. Sometimes the issue settles with the different methods of exercises (epley’s manure) prescribed by the doctor.
