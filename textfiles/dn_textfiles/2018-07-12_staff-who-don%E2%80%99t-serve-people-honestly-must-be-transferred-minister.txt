Staff who don’t serve people honestly must be transferred - Minister

“The ministry needs good workers who are ready to listen to the people and give an honest service to them. If the workers do not act accordingly and do not care for the needs of the people, they will have to be transferred. Our prime aim should be to provide quality service to the people, Labour and Trade Union Relations Minister Ravindra Samaraweera on Monday.
The minister was speaking at a seminar for deputy and assistant labour commissioners at the Labour Department.
Speaking about the difficulties faced by estate workers who come to the Labour Ministry or Labour Department, the minister said that a mobile service to aid the public will be launched in the near future with the assistance of the Central Bank.
He said the Asian Development Bank had already warned the country about the repercussions of offering the pension benefit. The bank indicates that countries which provide pensions will be unable to carry on even for the next 25 years, with the increase in the retirement-age population.
“We need to search for other options before it’s too late and we already have started discussions with trade unions. But the unions have a pessimistic view about the other options,” the Minister said.
Labour Secretary Nimal Saranatissa and Labour Commissioner A. Wimalaweera also participated in the event.
