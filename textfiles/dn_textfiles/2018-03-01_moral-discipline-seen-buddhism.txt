Moral discipline as seen in Buddhism

Moral discipline in Buddhism is not a rocket-science invention of an exceptional mind, but a rational and a practical code based on verifiable facts. That is why Prof. Max Muller of the Oxford University said that Buddhist moral code is the most perfect which the world has ever known.
All Buddhists are well aware of the four Noble Truths as preached by Buddha: that the life is full of suffering (Duhkha), that there is a cause of this suffering (Duhkha-samudaya), it is possible to stop suffering (Duhkha-nirodha), and there is a way to extinguish suffering (Duhkha-nirodha-marga).
Buddha also advocated Noble Eightfold Path (aryaastangika-marga) as a way to extinguishing the sufferings: right understanding, right thought, right speech, right action, right livelihood, right effort, right mindfulness, right concentration.
Mid-twentieth century saw the collaborations between many renowned western psychoanalysts and Buddhist scholars on Buddhism and western psychology. They found out that Buddhism and Western Psychology overlap in theory and in practice.
Over the last 60 years, experts have analysed many commonalities between Buddhism and various branches of modern western psychology like phenomenological psychology, psychoanalytical psychotherapy, humanistic psychology and cognitive psychology.
Buddha was a unique psychotherapist. His therapeutic methods helped millions of people throughout the centuries. The Buddhist perspective of moral discipline is a vast subject spread throughout the teachings of the Buddha. Currently many people seem to be very much alive to the subject of Buddhist moral discipline (sila), perhaps because moral discipline is fast slipping away from the thinking and behaviour of too many human beings.
What is moral discipline?
Before investigating the Buddhist view of moral discipline, it is necessary to see what is meant by the term moral discipline in general. This word indicates the distinction between right and wrong or good and evil in relation to actions, volitions and character. A moral sense is said to mean the power to understand the difference between right and wrong especially when viewed as an innate quality of the human mind, which is described as the moral faculty.
Moral concepts are terms involving ethical praise or blame, concerned with virtue and vice or rules of right conduct. Here, moral virtue is distinct from intellectual virtue just as moral laws are different from legal and institutional laws. Other aspects of moral discipline include moral rights, moral force, moral responsibility, moral courage, moral behaviour and moral victory.
Buddhist view
What is the criterion of moral discipline according to Buddha? The answer is found in the word of advice given by the Buddha to the young samanera Rahula. "While you are doing a bodily action, you should reflect on it: 'This bodily action I am doing — is it leading to self-affliction, to the affliction of others, or to both? Is it an unskilful bodily action, with painful consequences, painful results?' If, on reflection, you know that it is leading to self-affliction, to the affliction of others, or to both... you should give it up. But if on reflection you know that it is not... you may continue with it.” (Rahulovada Sutta)
The Buddhist view is that moral behaviour flows naturally from mastering one's ego, desires, cultivating loving kindness (metta), and compassion (karuna). The foundation teaching of Buddhism, expressed in the Four Noble Truths, is that the stress and unhappiness of life (dukkha) is caused by our desires and ego-clinging. The "program," for letting go of desire and ego is the Eightfold Path.
Ethical conduct - through speech, action and livelihood - is part of the path, as are mental discipline - through concentration and mindfulness - and wisdom.
The moral conduct in Buddha's teaching is centred around internal or individual rather than the things external to the individual. Buddhist practice of moral discipline is not done out of fear of any person or super-natural power. An external agent does not impose it. It has to come from within. It is the basis for further mental development.
Taming behaviour
In essence, moral discipline is the practice of taming bodily and verbal behaviours. The noble eightfold path explains it beautifully: Samma Vaca, Samma Kammanta, Samma Ajiva) or right speech, right action, and right livelihood. The next three factors may be treated together, as collectively they make up the path for moral discipline (silakkhandha).
Though the principles laid down in this section restrain immoral actions and promote good conduct, their ultimate purpose is not so much ethical as spiritual. They are not prescribed merely as guides to action, but primarily as aids to mental purification.
Refraining from false speech, slander, harsh speech and gossip is the practice of right words. Right actions are refraining from killing other beings, stealing and sexual misconduct. Right livelihood is refraining from livelihood that harms other beings, such as selling weapons, poison etc.
Need for moral discipline
Today, as a society, we are amidst a state of turmoil. Cherished ethics are being upturned. The forces of materialistic scepticism have turned their dissecting blades on the traditional concepts of what were considered humane qualities.
Yet, any sane person will understand that ethical issues play the most important role in his relationship with himself, his family and the society. For ethics has to do with human conduct. The need for ethics arises from the fact that man is not perfect by nature; he has to train himself to be good. Moral discipline in Buddhism is essentially practical in that it is only a means leading to the final goal of ultimate happiness. On the Buddhist path to the state of perfect well-being, each individual is considered responsible for his own fortunes and misfortunes. Each individual is expected to work his own deliverance by his understanding and effort. The Buddha's mission was to enlighten men as to the nature of existence and to advise them how best to act for their own happiness and for the benefit of others.
The theory of Buddhist ethics finds its practical expression in the various precepts. These precepts or disciplines are nothing but general guides to show the direction in which the Buddhist ought to turn to on his way to happiness.
In Buddhism, the distinction between what is good and what is bad is very simple: all actions that have their roots in greed, hatred, and delusion that spring from selfishness foster the harmful delusion of selfhood. They are called Akusala Kamma. All those actions which are rooted in the virtues of generosity, love and wisdom, are meritorious-and called Kusala Kamma.
The criteria of good and bad apply whether the actions are of thought, word or deed.Moral discipline in Buddhism is not a rocket-science invention of an exceptional mind, but a rational and a practical code based on verifiable facts.
That is why Prof. Max Muller of the Oxford University said that Buddhist moral code is the most perfect which the world has ever known. The Buddhist moral discipline is well illustrated in the Sigalovada, Vyagghapajja, Parabhava, Vasala, Mangala, Metta and the Dhammika suttas, in the Dhammapada.
