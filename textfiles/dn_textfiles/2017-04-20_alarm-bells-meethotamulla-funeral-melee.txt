Alarm bells at the Meethotamulla funeral melee

The hill of tears at the devastated vicinity of Meethotamulla rings alarming bells to the whole nation as most of the urban areas are in the making of similar Meethotamullas. Our empathy with them won’t do much and sympathy could do nothing as a pragmatic approach to find a permanent solution is the crying need. The need of the hour is that all the bogus politicians should take their hands off and let the president and the prime minister handle the matter against all the odds that may come on their way. It was quiet evident to the general public that almost all the politicians wanted to make the garbage dump a goldmine to them and a path to enter the parliament. It is stinky. The stink of the garbage is lesser than that of the politicians.
Bloemendhal is waiting to burst. The roadside garbage dumps in urban areas are fattening day-by-day to reach the size of their city counterparts and the whole country is sitting on a volcano.
In other countries garbage is a source of national income, yet in our paradise island garbage is an effective raw material for gaining political power. If a pragmatic approach is made to exploit garbage for good use almost all the fallow lands could be made fertile with homemade compost without importing artificial fertilizer.
Long term plan
Some countries need more and more garbage. During the recent past, much needed foreign exchange was spent by our Provincial Councillors and Pradeshiya Sabha members to go abroad on study tours to find solutions for such environmental problems as Meethotamulla. The government could obtain their knowledge to find a workable solution to the calamity or recover the money spent on such tours. People expect such actions from the government.
The expert hands should be allowed to work freely to design a long term plan for the problem. The politicians’ foul mouths should be shut and tightly locked till they work out a plan. No parliamentary debates or fasts unto death be allowed for a sufficient period till the environmental scientists and foreign delegates completes their studies. If a parliamentary session is given the whole Diyawanna would smell foul. The people will have to bear the brunt.
It is a great solace that Peradeniya University has risen to the occasion to make a feasibility study going deeper into the subject to put forward the suggestions. As a developing country, we always have to rely on home- grown solutions for our nagging problems. The scientists of Peradeniya University have already proved their mettle by predicting and suggesting solutions to Meethotamulla environmental menace even though they have gone unheeded by the relevant authorities who now have come forward to offer relief measures.
The responsibility of this gravest tragedy in the recent past of our country should be shared by every government that who amassed garbage adjacent to their dwellings. Some of our armchair pundits might have obtained doctorates by going round the garbage heap and publishing them in international magazines. The public protests that emerged from the very hearts’ core of the bereaved families demand not only compensation but also a long lasting solution. Take care and beware, when innocent people are affected by vibrant anger unprecedented tragedies could take place. Several banners had been worded to pass that message to the bogus and opportunistic politicians not to come for begging their votes without genuinely taking pragmatic actions to bring them solace for them to sleep in peace.
Strict vigilance
It was reported in the national press that looting and thefts had raised its ugly head in the tragedy –stricken Meethotamulla. Strict punishments ought to be meted out to them without any mitigation in the most deterrent manner. No political meddling should be allowed for mitigation of their punishment and strict vigilance has to be maintained to avoid further ugly happenings. Another vital aspect of our discussions should be community health. My authentic experience is that when I was passing this area one day on my way to a funeral an unbearable stink made me nearly fainted.
On my asking my friend Mr. Mayakaduwa reminded me that we were passing this garbage heap which could be virtually a tourist distraction or else they would make a good study of the miscellany of foul smells of the pearl in the Indian ocean or the Taprobane or the Serendib. It was my beyond my mundane imagination how the residents of this area would have lived on this hell on the paradise island.
The doctors and serious environmental scientists might have done in depths studies in to this perennial problem and they could be invited to come forward to submit their research findings for the benefit of the country. Even the farsighted politicians might have conducted research on how to win their seats in unhygienic conditions.
This tragedy that took over thirty valuable lives in a very few days could be taken as an eye opener. Yet, the solutions for the calamity should not be an eye-wash. The whole country is eagerly looking forward to a long lasting solution with utmost regard to the environmental and health aspects.
Dear president, ‘BEAR THE CROSS AND HAVE FAITH’.
Crystal clearly, you have had nearly fourteen hurdles to your credit.
