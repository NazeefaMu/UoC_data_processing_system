Swap flowers for a pizza bouquet on your wedding day

Your wedding should be an expression of you and your partner, merging your shared interests and love in a special day for your friends and family to enjoy.
Now there’s a perfect way to show your cherished guests what you’re all about – a pizza bouquet.
For people who don’t love flowers (they just die?!) or want something with more personality, Villa Pizza in the US are giving couples the opportunity to walk these beauties down the aisle. They come in bouquet format or as a button-hole for the groom, and are made of ‘freshly prepared pizza dough, 100 percent whole milk mozzarella, fresh California tomatoes and zesty pepperoni.’
These creations were dreamed up by Villa and food stylist Jessie Bearden to look like real flowers, with all sorts of swirly patterns and doughy petals.
Unfortunately those of us who don’t live in America won’t get a chance to live our cheesy dreams, as it’s part of a competition by Villa stateside.
Couples getting married before the end of September in the US can simply enter the details of their big day and be in with a chance of stonebaked goodness for their nuptials. It’d be a miracle if it makes it to the altar in one piece.
