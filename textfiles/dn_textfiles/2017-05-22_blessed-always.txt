Blessed Always

The Buddhists the world over celebrated the thrice blessed day. The Enlightenment of the Buddha led to the emergence of the doctrine of the Dhamma “Go forth Bhikkus taking the message into the world and explain to them what I have explained for the wellbeing of the majority and the solace of the living” so said the Buddha.
The message thus proclaimed was brought to our motherland from India the Jambuddweepa. Ever since Sri Lanka has had a long history of religious and cultural ties with India. (The service rendered is too wide a subject to be dealt with here). As history continues to evolve and reshape itself so have the religious links and ties with India in particular and other neighboring countries. From India and Sri Lanka Buddhism spread to Burma. Thailand, Vietnam, Cambodia, Indonesia, China and Japan in the East and also countries in the West like UK, USA and European countries in the recent past. European scholars too have begun to study Buddhism.
Many Buddhist monks have taken Buddhism to almost every country in the globe. The Buddhist missionary monks of the 19th and 20th centuries have performed a great service by establishing the Buddhist Missionary society to propagate the Dhamma through books and various other publications, organising seminars, discussions and meditation retreats as well as youth training and Dhamma activities. This means a Buddhist awakening and a great revival in its true sense. From time immemorial Sri Lanka has been the most important place that played a vital role in protecting the Theravada Doctrine. It was clearly unfolded touching life at all points covering the entire process of moral conduct. Sri Lanka had long realised that Theravada Buddhism was the most important in the life of Buddhists. The ancient royalty, the most commanding, has made us proud of our past in upholding Theravada. Several ancient kings occupy a unique place in pioneering the Buddhist resurgence enthusiastically. In this back drop there was no doubt that the Dharmadweepa was fairing well, for the betterment of the human society.
Incredibly a special event
Now going back to my topic what a dream come true when a religious event of great significance and such magnitude was held in Sri Lanka for the first time in the annals of history. This is none other than the International Vesak Festival celebrated in the Motherland recently. Thanks to the Ministry of Buddha Sasana and organisations concerned for the magnanimous task. The United Nations Vesak Day is held annually since 2002 on a plea from the United Nations in 1999 by the then Foreign Minister, late Lakshman Kadiragamar - a true son of the Lankan soil, a distinguished university product during Jennings era who claimed that it was not Oxford but Peradeniya that made him a classy all-rounder to serve the Motherland.
Being a Theravada Buddhist country the main aim of having the International Vesak festival was to spread the message of love and compassion and ensure that all people enjoy peace and prosperity. UN has been a long term organisation in Sri Lanka to help achieve her goals not only in national development and reforms in good governance. Hence all heads of states of the Buddhist countries leaders of eight countries had been invited to participate in the celebrations. Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi was the Chief Guest at the festival, further strengthening our long standing cordial relations.
The greatest bliss
International Vesak arrangements included the declaration of Vesak Week in colourful Vesak ceremony organised island-wide to celebrate the sacred occasion. The true meaning of Vesak was well reflected in the vast range of activities performed by Sri Lankan Buddhists with great devotion and gusto. Pandals in the city, Vesak zones full of flags and lanterns all the way with wonderful décor and vibrant colours, Dansalas exhibiting their generosity are just a few meritorious deeds kept in line with the sublime message of Dhamma. Among others there were intellectual discussions, academic sessions, religious observances providing a fantastic opportunity to witness a serene Buddhist atmosphere in keeping with Buddhist Philosophy.
