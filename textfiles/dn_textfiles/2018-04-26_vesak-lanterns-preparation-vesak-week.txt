Vesak lanterns preparation for the Vesak Week

Public were inconvenienced as traffic around the Town Hall area came to a standstill yesterday due to Colombo Municipal Council (CMC) workers closing down the road in front of the CMC during the rush hour in the day time, to put up Vesak lanterns in preparation for the Vesak Week.
