Sri Lanka clinches  continued C’wealth support for international trade

Sri Lanka has received continued support for its international trade work from the Commonwealth on Thursday.
Industry and Commerce Minister Rishad Bathiudeen is representing Sri Lanka at the inaugural Commonwealth Trade Ministers’ Meeting that opened in London on Thursday.
Development Strategies and International Trade Minister Malik Samarawickrama also participated.
Minister Bathiudeen said: “We are set to receive continued support from the Commonwealth to our international trade work.”
He said Sri Lanka’s historic relations with the Commonwealth stands further enhanced with this pioneering event. The “Agenda for Growth” idea to promote trade, investment and job creation in member countries such as Sri Lanka will help the unity government’s reform vision of industry and commerce, he said.
Minister Bathiudeen met Secretary-General Patricia Scotland and discussed the progress of Commonwealth’s projects in Sri Lanka. The Secretary-General Scotland thanked Sri Lanka for its contribution to the Commonwealth Trade Finance Facility and discussed ongoing projects where the secretariat is providing technical assistance to Sri Lanka. These include support with free trade agreement negotiations, designing an export diversification strategy and helping to set up an export/import bank.
