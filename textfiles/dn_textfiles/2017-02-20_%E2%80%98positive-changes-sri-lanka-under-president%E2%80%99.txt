‘Positive changes in Sri Lanka under President’

Positive changes are taking place in Sri Lanka under the leadership of the President and his Unity Government, said Sri Lankan Consul General in Italy Pradeepa Saram.
She was addressing the Independence Day celebrations organised by the Consulate General in Italy recently.
“It is particularly a matter of pride that the Sri Lankan expatriate community in Northern Italy has made a tremendous contribution to the strengthening of relations between Sri Lanka and Italy. I take this opportunity to recognize their invaluable contribution during difficult times in our recent history,” she added. “Their remittances make a significant contribution to Sri Lanka’s economy.”
The Consul General added that the Milan Consulate was established in 2016 to further bilateral relations with Italy and serve the large Sri Lankan expatriate community.
The ceremony commenced with the hoisting of the National Flag by the Consul General, followed by the singing of the National Anthem by the Sri Lankan children living in Milan. The National Anthem was sung in Sinhala and Tamil exemplifying the government’s efforts towards national reconciliation and ethnic harmony.
Religious dignitaries representing Buddhists, Hindu, Islam and Christian faiths bestowed their blessings on the nation and the people of Sri Lanka.
A two-minutes silence was observed to commemorate War Heroes and others who sacrificed their lives for the motherland.
The Independence Day messages of the President, Prime Minister and Foreign Affairs Minister were read out in all three languages.
A cultural programme was held by the Sri Lankan children living in Milan. The Consul General also attended an event organized by the Comune di Baranzate in Milan to celebrate the Independence. The event was attended by a large number of Sri Lankans residing in Baranzate and Italian well-wishers.
