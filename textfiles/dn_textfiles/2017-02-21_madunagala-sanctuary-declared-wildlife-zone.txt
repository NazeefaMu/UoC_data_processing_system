Madunagala Sanctuary declared wildlife zone

The Madunagala sanctuary was declared a wildlife zone through a special gazette notification. The 995 hectare reserve has been an elephant habitat since ancient times.
About 21 elephants, deer, anteaters, wild fowls, chevrotains (meeminna), and colourful birds exist in the sanctuary.
An 8 km barbed wire fence was erected to keep away elephants from invading the village, Range Officer in-charge J.A. Piyasena said.
