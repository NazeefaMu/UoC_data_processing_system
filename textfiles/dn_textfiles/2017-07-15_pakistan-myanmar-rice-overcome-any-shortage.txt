Pakistan, Myanmar rice to overcome any shortage

Pakistan and Myanmar have agreed to supply 55,000 MT of rice immediately to overcome any possible rice shortage in the country.
A four member team of officials that flew to Pakistan and Myanmar to have discussions on importing rice stocks to the country have informed Industry and Commerce Minister Rishad Bathiudeen that these countries were willing to supply the necessary rice stocks to Sri Lanka immediately.
According to an Industry and Commerce Ministry official, Pakistan has agreed to supply 25,000 MT immediately.
“No final price has been quoted yet but once the final price is agreed, the rice stocks would shipped from Pakistan in early August. Pakistan is also ready to supply more rice quantities by September,” the Ministry official said. He added that Myanmar is ready to supply another 30,000 MT immediately once the final price is agreed.
“Sri Lankan officials also bargained for lower prices than the prices first quoted by both Pakistan and Myanmar. Officials of both countries agreed that such bargaining is acceptable and said shall submit Sri Lanka’s bargained price quotes to their respective Cabinets (of Ministers) for approval, to complete the government to government sales, the official said. The Sri Lankan team was led by Industry and Commerce Ministry Secretary Chinthaka Lokuhetti and two Finance Ministry officials. A food technologist from the Industrial Technology Institute also participated.
