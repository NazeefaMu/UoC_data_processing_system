Court issues warrant on Commissioner General of Motor Traffic

 
The Kaduwela Magistrate Courts issued a warrant on the Commissioner General of Motor Traffic today, for failing to appear before courts multiple times.
He has been summoned to testify in the case filed against Hambantota MP Namal Rajapaksa. MP Namal Rajakasa is said to have bought a Fort Mustang with tax exemptions.
The Financial Crimes Investigation Division (FCID) seized the Ford Mustang on September 5, 2016 from Kaduwela.
