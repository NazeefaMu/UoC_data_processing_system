Anomalies in doctor appointments to be resolved soon

No state hospital should be closed and all state hospitals should function 24 hours, Health Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne said.
Minister Senaratne instructed health officials of the Health Ministry and Provincial Health Ministries to provide doctors to all state hospitals without discrimination. A total of 1,200 new post-intern appointments are to be given to doctors next month.
The minister was addressing the Provincial Health Ministers’ Summit in Colombo, on Monday.
Minister Senaratne pointed out that the anomaly in appointing doctors to Provincial, General and Teaching Hospitals should be addressed as soon as possible. The minister instructed officials to formulate a vacancy list of all hospitals to provide doctors to all state hospitals in the country. Meanwhile, doctors and provincial health authorities revealed that the allowance paid to doctors for their mobile telephone bills had cut down from Rs. 4,000 to Rs. 2,500. Minister Senaratne promised to solve the issue after discussing with the Treasury.
