CBEU’s People’s Bank branch to strike on Feb. 7

Members of the Ceylon Bank Employees Union’s People’s Bank branch have decided to launch a one day strike on February 7 to protest against the alleged failure on the part of the Bank management to resolve many outstanding problems of bank employees.
The membership had taken this decision following the breakdown of talks held with the management due to its unfavourable response to the demands put forward by the union, said CBEU President T G W Gunawardene in a press release yesterday.
The release said the Bank management had pruned the rights of employees by abolishing the Transfer Board, Employees Board of Appeal, Joint Council on workers’ grievances, doing away with service extensions and through punishments meted out to union officials for participating in trade union activities and several other activities.
The employees had taken this action as a last resort because all efforts made to settle issues during talks had failed due to the authoritarian attitude of the management and the inconvenience caused to bank customers is regretted.
