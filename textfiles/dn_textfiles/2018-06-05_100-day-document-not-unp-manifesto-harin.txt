The 100 day document, not a UNP manifesto - Harin

The 100 day programme was a policy document prepared and promoted by the supporters of Common Candidate Maithripala Sirisena at the Presidential Election in 2015 and not a UNP manifesto, Minister Harin Fernando yesterday said.
Fernando pointed out that the campaign promoted the slogan “Maithri Palanayak, Dina Siyakin Aluth Ratak (A Maithri governance and a new country in 100 days)” which was a concept of all those who supported the Common Candidate against the former regime.
The newly appointed UNP Spokesman and the Chief of Central Media Unit, Minister Harin Fernando said that the endorsement of a Common Candidate for the 2015 Presidential Election was not an idea that was single handedly marketed by the UNP, but that it was the common demand of all the organizations, movements and campaigns against the previous regime.
This was the first reference made by the UNP to President Maithripala Sirisena’s recent observation of the 100 day programme was at a ceremony held at Sri Lanka Foundation.
Minister Fernando was speaking at the launching ceremony of the UNP Central Media Unit and the “Sathya” (Truth) programme which was held at the Sirikotha UNP Headquarters yesterday afternoon.
“The decision to topple Rajapaksa regime was a truthful decision we all collectively took. The truth is that, when the General Secretary of the SLFP Maithripala Sirisena gave up his position to become the Common Candidate, it earned him much respect and credibility. The truth is that, the 100 day programme added value to that credibility of the Common Candidate. The truth is that 100 day programme was not a UNP manifesto but a policy document created by the all those who supported the Common Candidate,” Minister Harin Fernando said.
Fernando also said that it the 100 day programme was not a 100% success.
“There were some promises that we could not keep. But we kept most of the important promises made in this programme. These include the National Pharmaceutical Policy, the Right to Information Act, 19th Amendment and the Independent Commissions. These are things to be happy about.” Fernando said.Speaking of the “Sathya” (Truth) Campaign, Minister Fernando said “that our vision is to ensure that the public is aware of and informed of all steps taken by the United National party to uplift the lives of the Sri Lankan people, and to ensure that any and all news is disseminated in a clear, concise and factual manner, thereby building trust and goodwill between the people and the party.”
Speaking of the Code of Conduct of the Media Unit, Minister Fernando said that “We will always be truthful.
“We consider this as our responsibility. We recognise your honesty. We believe it is your right; the people should know the truth. We accept that it is a fundamental right of the people.”
