Meet the Thai Ambassador at National Chamber on Nov. 8

The Thai Ambassador of Thailand to Sri Lanka, Chulamanee Chartsuwan will be the Special Guest Speaker in “Meet the Ambassador’ program on “Bilateral Trade Between Sri Lanka and Thailand” on November 8, 2017, at the National Chamber from 3.00 p.m to 4.30 p.m, No 450 D R Wijewardene Mawatha Colombo 10.
She will be accompanied by the First Secretary of the Embassy, Chotika Attapimon. The Ambassador will speak on the current business trend, trade potential, and opportunities for export/import, investment, and other services available for Sri Lankans in Indonesia. The participants will get an opportunity to interact with the Ambassador and other officials of the embassy and get information on trade matters.
With a well-developed infrastructure, a free-enterprise economy, and generally pro-investment policies, Thailand is highly dependent on international trade, with exports accounting for about two-thirds of GDP.
The agricultural sector, comprised mostly of small-scale farmers, contributes 10% of GDP but employs about one-third of the labor force. Thailand faces labor shortages, and has attracted an estimated 2-4 million migrant workers from neighboring countries.
Thai and Sri Lankan businessmen can trade and invest on areas of agriculture and processed food, gems and jewellery, electronics, automotive parts, rubber, tourism including hotel management and alternative energy.
