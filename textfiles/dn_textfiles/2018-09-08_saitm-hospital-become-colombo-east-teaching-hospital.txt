SAITM Hospital to become Colombo East Teaching Hospital

Dr. Neville Fernando Hospital will be developed as the Colombo East Teaching Hospital and medical students at the Kotelawala Defence University (KDU) will be provided with clinical training at it, Health and Indigenous Medicine Minister Dr Rajitha Senaratne said.
He was responding to a question by JVP MP Dr. Nalinda Jayatissa in Parliament yesterday.
The Minister said the SAITM hospital is now being operated as a fully Government owned hospital. “It is being operated by a Director Board similar to that of the Sri Jayewardenapura Hospital. However, the final agreement with regard to this hospital is yet to be signed and after that we can provide it with more hospital bds and staff,” he added. Minister Senaratne said he would present a Cabinet Paper to the next Cabinet meeting to lay down the future course of action related to the Neville Fernando Hospital.
He said the Government intends to develop the Mulleriyawa Hospital and the Neville Fernando Hospital as teaching hospitals.
