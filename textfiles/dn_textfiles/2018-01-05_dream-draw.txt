The Dream In the Draw

Complimentary polenta bites were served to my table with a relish, followed by my order of the magnificent ‘Italian Flag,’which is a trio of my three favourite pastas: lasagna (red), gnocchi (white) and ravioli (green).
The food was so authentically Italian that it was hard to believe, surrounded by stunning Sri Lankan batiks, that I had not been teleported to Italy. Between courses, one can shop from the handy craft stall installation by the Italian style show kitchen, which includes wonderful hand painted wedding couples - something Galle Fort is famous for being a backdrop to and also a chef with an oversized hat. The lovely hand loom toys, bags and artisan gifts are simply stunning and are just a small selection of what the owner sells in her two shops on Pedlar’s Street.
An amazing demonstration
For anyone who fancies a change from curry after circumnavigating the island and loves Italian food and wickedly delicious desserts then nowhere could be more fun for a night out or just a cheeky lunch with a friend than The Pasta Factory. To get there, head through Odels on Pedlar’s Street and then cross the road at the back of the shop and you will find The Pasta Factory on the opposite side at 16/1, Leyn Baan Cross Street, Galle Fort. Coming from the other way, walk along fashionable Church Street past the Fort Bazaar hotel turn right into Leyn Baan Cross Street and look for the big black warehouse-style doors or just follow the delicious smells from the kitchen. Just make sure you pick up a bottle of wine along the way as nothing beats a glass of wine with pasta and as there is no corkage fee this just adds to an already great value restaurant.

Paola, the owner, is a delightful Italian lady well known for her love of gorgeous fabrics and food, now brings to the fort her authentic family ancestral recipes. She loves to chat to the restaurant guests explaining all the different pasta and sauce combinations and little stories about life in the old city, where she married into a wonderful Sri Lankan family, who have been trading in gemstones since the 1930s. She explained that her business partner from Italy is her uncle Arnaldo and before they opened he came over and trained the team for three months in how to make real hand made pasta. After the meal, she gave me an amazing demonstration on how to hand make the tagliatelle. I really had no idea it had to be folded so many times before it was cut to perfection and the freshly made Bolognese sauce added to it. One can watch the chef making the pasta every day and the saucy sauces that have made the restaurant jump into the Amangalla’s top five ‘places to eat’ list in Galle, which is amazing in such a short space of time and bearing in mind there are over a hundred other venues to pick from.
Great sayings
The Pasta Factory opens at ten o’clock every morning serving freshly made cakes and real Italian coffee with creamer and is a great place to order a take out, if going sightseeing for the day, as they add a complimentary special treat with every order. Paola, who has a son, also caters for children’s taste buds with an excellent kids menu at prices that make it affordable for the whole family to go there for dinner. The staff are full of fun and great sayings like the ones on the walls ‘Make each day…a story worth telling.’ They also have lots of dishes for both vegetarians and vegans, of which the aubergine parmigiana is a run away success story.
For those who like to live life and understand the true meaning of passion, this is a restaurant that serves hand made pasta from Paola’s grand mum’s recipes that beautifully match the ancient traditions of this trading port and island that Marco Polo said was the finest one of its size in the world. Had he discovered The Pasta Factory he might have added a place that makes the finest handmade Italian food in the world. So, go on and try the ‘Italian Flag’ and finish off with the orgasmic tiramisu and see if I am lying!
