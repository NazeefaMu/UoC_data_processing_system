Revision bail application by Anura Senanayaka fixed for June 2

The Colombo High Court yesterday fixed for June 2 to consider the bail revision application filed by Western Province former Senior DIG Anura Senanayake arrested and remanded over his alleged role in the cover up of evidence in the former rugby player Wasim Thajudeen murder.
However, Deputy Solicitor General Dilan Ratnayake raised objections to release the suspect on bail at this juncture citing that police were yet to conclude investigations into the incident.
Through this revision application, former DIG sought an order against the Colombo Additional Magistrate’s refusal to enlarge him on bail and argued that there is no justifiable reason to do so.
The petitioner said that the Colombo Additional Magistrate had refused to release him on bail on a number of occasions since he had been charged for conspiring to commit a murder. The petitioner said there is no evidence to prove that he was involved in conspiring to commit a murder and thereby moved Court that he be released on bail.
The prosecution maintained that there is a suspicion that the suspect had been involved along with the main suspects to commit this murder since the circumstantial evidence has suggested that the suspects had done their investigations to record Thajudeen’s death as a fatal road accident.
