Live life with no regrets

Drug abuse and addiction is a serious problem in our Society with more and more youth coming under its influence. Main reasons for drug addiction are unhappiness, lack of inner strength and poverty, which combined with the availability of drugs, set the horrible trap for the youth and senior citizens of Sri Lanka. The Daily News spoke to some key figures in society as to how we can tackle the problem of drug abuse.
Senior Lecturer, Department of Psychiatry, Faculty of Medicine, University of Colombo, Consultant Psychiatrist, National Hospital of Sri Lanka, Director, Centre for Combating Tobacco (CCT), Faculty of Medicine, University of Colombo and Chairman, Alcohol and Drug Information Centre (ADIC) Sri Lanka, Dr. Mahesh Rajasuriya MD (Psychiatry) pointed out that it is not just the brain that is addicted to drugs, it is the person. It is not just a brain disorder, but a bio-psycho-social disorder, like any other mental illness. The biology of brain, the psychology of the person and the social circumstance around the person are important in predisposition for and precipitation and perpetuation of this disorder, again like in any other mental illness.
Withdrawal effects
“Drugs don’t do much to the brain if taken once. What you then experience is called intoxication. However, there is a significant psychosocial component in intoxication. However, when the drug is used again and again the brain learns to adjust to the drug. Then the brain can tolerate higher doses of the drug. This usually happens with daily drug use, sometimes more than once a day. At this stage, if the drug is withheld, the brain function becomes abnormal since now the brain is used to function “normally” with the continuous presence of the drug. These are called withdrawal effects. Drug use at this level is what is called addiction or drug dependence. However, even before dependence develops, the drug use is associated with significant negative physical and psychosocial impact,” explained Rajasuriya.
Rajasuriya went onto explain that whenever drug availability goes up there are more people using it and level of use going up in current users.
“We know for sure that if heroin is not available in an area, we hardly find heroin users there. Whenever government and Police genuinely crack down on drugs, more people present to our clinic asking help to stop drug use. Drug use is commoner in people who are poorer and have had psychosocial adversities, however, it is not yet clear if that is why they use drugs,” stated Rajasuriya.
Society’s role
Rajasuriya further added that parents, schools and responsible civilians have a huge role to play in the battle against drugs. They need to make children assertive and independent, not obedient, timid, unwise victims to be used by drug suppliers. Teach them the truth about the widely held untrue beliefs-the myths. The vulnerable children are the ones who are timid and cannot resist pressure from others. Those who may appear very strong may also be vulnerable if they are victims of myths. Availability of drugs is another major factor. In some houses alcohol and cigarettes are available at home. There are mini bars at home!
“All drug users start off with cigarettes or alcohol or cannabis. Unless we reduce demand and supply for these, we won’t be able to reduce other drug use. Children of poor families where mother is in Middle East and children of affluent families both are vulnerable,” said Rajasuriya.
Department of Social Service, Social Service Officer Jayantha Premalal, points out that lack of information, lack of spirituality, lack of confidence and poverty spell doom for some youth.
“Our younger generation do not have a complete understanding of drugs. When someone introduces this to their lifestyle and they get addicted. Some parents do not have the time to pay attention to their children because of their hectic lifestyles. As a result the children are not guided properly. Some young people do not have common sense and they are not knowledgeable. They do not realize that drugs are highly addictive,” said Premalal.
“If most of these young people are into drugs, then the power of our labour force is reduced. If young people are mentally and physically disabled then that becomes a huge problem. If they are not healthy enough to be employed that becomes a serious cause for concern.”
Self-confidence
Self-confidence is another factor that determines whether if you are strong enough to say NO to drugs. You meet a drug pusher in the playground and he or she asks you to try it out or maybe your peers encourage you to try out some drugs and you do it because you want to fit in. It all depends on how strong you are.
“Building up a young person’s self-confidence is equally important. If they have self-confidence and are aware of the danger of drugs they can say NO to drugs. They can reject drugs. They understand that drugs are unhealthy,” explained Premalal.
We know drug abuse destroys families and households because the financial situation in a home suffers. The harmony and peace within a home is destroyed and shattered. Domestic violence may even take place. If the father takes drugs, the unity and well-being of the family is undermined. If children start to take drugs then again the wellbeing of the family is under threat.
“Another deterrent to drugs is leading a virtuous life. If there is ‘spirituality’ within a household that will protect everyone from the danger of drugs. Then there is less chance of someone in that household using drugs,” pointed out Premalal.
Another factor is ‘who young people look up to?’ There are so many celebrities who use drugs. Young people watch them all on television and think to themselves that they would like to be like that celebrity. However if they have proper role models in life then they can reject drugs. If we have positive role models in life then again that acts as a deterrent to drugs. If there are proper examples in society then children can look up to them and lead a moral life.
Drug abuse leads to poverty because once you get addicted to drugs then to satisfy yourself you spend more and more money trying to obtain drugs and before you realize this sad truth you are in the depths of poverty. However, poverty also leads to drug abuse since due to the abysmal state of their lives, drug users look for a release – to cope with the stress of poverty and the unhappiness in their lives.
“The main problem with poor people is lack of education - lack of opportunities. This is where the availability of programmes at schools to raise awareness about drugs is so important. There is also the environmental and genetic factors. If the father is in the habit of using drugs then the child is vulnerable. The child may be predisposed to drug addiction. If the environment around someone is also unstable, then that too might lead to the person falling into drug addiction,” said Premalal.
Professor Emeritus, University of Peradeniya, Kalinga Tudor Silva presented the case against drugs from a sociological aspect.
“The breakdown of the family, emergence of a peer culture supportive of substance abuse, development of drug peddling as a livelihood and as part of organised crime, and lack of social control over some individuals are among the better known factors involved. In addition to these factors, the post-war context may also be responsible in that breakdown of law and order situation. Use of drugs as a profit making activity by certain groups of fighters as well as members of armed forces is evident in narco-terrorism widely reported in Latin American countries and the social breakdown associated with war-related population movements and the like,” stated Silva.
Silva pointed out that drug abuse has multiple impacts including disruption of family life, disruption of education and livelihoods, promotion of related misconduct such as sex work and involvement in crime in order to sustain substance abuse. Implication of law enforcement persons in drug related offences is another social impact of this issue.
“Some studies indicate that youth from urban and semi urban backgrounds are particularly vulnerable when it comes to gang activities, availability of drugs and connections with organised crime. There were a few instances where social media has been used to attract youth to parties where drugs are used on a collective basis to get high and this is perhaps a new trend triggered by heavy infiltration of social media into youth culture in Sri Lanka,” added Professor Silva.
Narcotics Bureau
DIG of Police Narcotics Bureau (PNB) Sajeewa Medawatte, commented that the PNB is the premier drug enforcement agency in Sri Lanka. The PNB has a concept called PDPIR concept – Prevention, Detection, Prosecution, Investigation and Rehabilitation.
“There are very capable officers attached to the Narcotics Bureau and we share information with all local law enforcement agencies and intelligence agencies. We have links with the organised crime division and STF (Special Task Force). PNB, STF and Organized Crime Division are all working together. We have direct contact with United Nations On Drugs And Crime (UNODC) and National Dangerous Drugs Control Board (NDDCB) and foreign law enforcement agencies with which we have direct links. So we are conducting raids and collecting information and we are dealing with the prison system. We are all putting systems in place because the drug dealers and drug traffickers are also changing their way of doing things,” said DIG Medawatte.
DIG opined that Drug users should be sent to the rehabilitation centres.
“But in Sri Lanka unfortunately Drug Users are being sent to prison. Prisons being over crowded is a big issue. But what should be happening is that the abusers should be sent to rehabilitation centres and drug traffickers and dealers should be sent to prison. So the Law and Order Ministry is looking to change some laws.
“We should separate the drug traffickers and the abusers. For drug abuse the punishments are very high in Sri Lanka. So first we need to identify what the drugs are. In Sri Lanka there are so many synthetic drugs. Mainly for Cocaine, Heroin and Cannabis, the punishments are very high. When it comes to drugs the demand and supply is very important. Our task is to reduce the supply. But so many agencies are looking to reduce the demand, especially the National Dangerous Drugs Control Board, (NDDCB.) But our task as PNB, is to reduce the supply. Drugs come from illegal sea routes and through the harbour and sometimes through the airport,” explained DIG Medawatte.
Medawatte pointed out that the PNB has contact with the SAARC countries – the SAARC DRUG OFFENCES MONITORING DESK. They share information with all the SAARC countries.
“From the Golden Triangle - Thailand, Laos, and Myanmar – we get Heroin, Cocaine, Hashish. We are getting most of the Heroin from Afghanistan through Pakistan. We need direct contact with all the other law enforcement agencies. We can implement our laws in our water areas only. If we want to exceed that we need to keep contact with the other international agencies – INTERPOL and DEA (Drug Enforcement Administration). On information we do the raids,” explained DIG Medawatte.
Medawatte pointed out that a mega project has now been launched with the Education Ministry and the Ministry of Law and Order. In high schools – government and private, they are starting a committee against drugs. More than 6,000 committees have already been established in the schools consisting of prefects, teachers, principals and old boys. There is a monitoring committee as well. That is handled by the OIC – Officer in Charge of that area. There is also a monk or priest. They are monitoring the system. Through that the drug situation will be controlled.
“The police in Sri Lanka is working with the public and this system has proved to be the most effective anywhere in the world. Here information is smoothly transferred. Earlier PNB, STF and Organized Crime Division worked separately. But now we are working together. A combined effort,” said DIG Medawatte.
