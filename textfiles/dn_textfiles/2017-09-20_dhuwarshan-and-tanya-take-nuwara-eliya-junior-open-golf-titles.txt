Dhuwarshan and Tanya take Nuwara Eliya Junior Open Golf titles

The historic 128 year old Nuwra Eliya Golf Club, a members only club in an effort to support and foster the national golf programme conducted a Junior Open tournament at the picturesque Nuwara Eliya golf course recently. The tournament was a great success with over 70 youngsters competing for honours with prizes being awarded in the age group categories Gold division (15 – 18 yrs), Silver division (12 – 14 yrs), Bronze division (10 – 11 yrs) and Copper division( 9 and under). As per the tournament rules only those in the gold and silver divisions who played the full 18 holes were eligible for the Junior Open titles.
Almost fittingly and in keeping with the clubs vision 14 year old Dhuwarshan of St Xavier College a product of the golf clinic program of NEGC and a relative newcomer to the sport clinched the boys title although playing in the silver division with a superb gross score of 76. Favourite for the girls title Taniya Balasuriya secured her win easily by 8 strokes over rising star Kayla Perera who promised much early on but disappointed once again and had to settle for the runner up spot.
In the individual divisions, Vinod Weerasinghe took the gold division with a score of 79 from Armand Flamer Caldera who shot a gross 80 and once again seemed to have lapses in concentration at crucial times. Kayla Perera took the Silver division as expected but was made to fight tooth and nail by Dilshan Malinda both ending up with identical scores of 86. Kayla was eventually awarded the division on better scores on the back 6 holes.
The bronze division played over 14 holes saw stiff competition amongst the juniors but eventually Nirekh Tejwani of Colombo International School won easily with a clear 4 shot win. However in this age group three youngsters fought hard for honours with Yannik Kumara taking runner up spot followed closely by Sherin Mithara and Shanal Binuksha.
The juniors in the Copper Division, the youngest age group played over just 9 holes showed a keen competition and a whole lot of enthusiasm. Finally a local boy, C. Dharaniyan of Our Lady School in Nuwara Eliya won the division with a score of 47NEGC Junior Open Golf Championship
