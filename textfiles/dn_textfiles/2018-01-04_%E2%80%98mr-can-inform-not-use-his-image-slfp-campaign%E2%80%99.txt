‘MR can inform not to use his image in SLFP campaign’

Since former President Mahinda Rajapaksa is still a member and patron of the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP), if he does not like his image being used in the SLFP campaign, he can inform the party not to use it on posters and cutouts at the upcoming local government polls,” Co-Cabinet Spokesman Minister Dayasiri Jayasekara said yesterday.
He said that normally, SLFP publishes posters and cutouts with images of the present President, former Prime Minister S. W. R. D. Bandaranaike, former Prime Minister Sirimavo Bandaranaike, former President Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumarathunga, and former President Mahinda Rajapaksa. The UNP also uses the images of former Prime Minister D. S. Senanayake onwards for their cutouts and posters.
“However, we wonder why the image of Prof. G. L. Peiris is not being used by the SLPP party, although he is the leader of that party,” he added.
Co-Cabinet Spokesman Rajitha Senaratne said that former President Mahinda Rajapaksa is retired now and questioned as to why his image is still being used in cutouts and posters of the SLPP instead of using its leader Prof. Pieris’s image.
