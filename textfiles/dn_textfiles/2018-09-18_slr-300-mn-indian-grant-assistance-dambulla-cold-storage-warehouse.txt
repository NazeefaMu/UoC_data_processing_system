SLR 300 mn Indian grant assistance for Dambulla cold storage warehouse

India and Sri Lanka signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) yesterday for the construction of a 5000-metric ton temperature controlled warehouse in Dambulla.
The event was held at the High Commission of India, Colombo in the presence of senior officials from the Sri Lankan Government.
The project envisages construction of a 5000-metric ton temperature controlled warehouse for fruits and vegetables to minimise its post-harvest losses, which are presently at around 40%.
This initiative will benefit the farming community by reducing wastage particularly during the peak season when there is surplus production.
This will help check the price fluctuation and ensure delivery of good quality agro produce to consumers.
This project is in continuation of Government of India’s efforts to partner with the Government of Sri Lanka in people oriented development projects.
India’s overall commitment of development assistance to Sri Lanka stands at a total of around US$ 3 billion, out of which US$ 550 million is pure grant assistance.
