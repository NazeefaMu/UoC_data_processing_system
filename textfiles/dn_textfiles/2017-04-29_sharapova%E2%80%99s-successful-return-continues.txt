Sharapova’s successful return continues

Maria Sharapova made it two wins out of two following her return from a 15-month doping ban by defeating fellow Russian Makarova 7-5 6-1.
The five-time Grand Slam winner dominated Makarova, ranked 43 in the world, wrapping up the victory in just one hour, 20 minutes.
Sharapova was powerful on serve, as she had been in Wednesday’s win over Italy’s Roberta Vinci, but struggled at times with her return.
Once she had claimed the first set with a late break of serve, she powered through the second, breaking twice before wrapping up the match with an ace.
“Practice and playing are so different and you can only prepare the best you can,” Sharapova said.
“The reaction and anticipation you need are so hard to replicate in training and these are the things I need.”
SHARAPOVA MAINTAINS MENTAL HOLD - ANALYSIS
She may not have figured in any draw for 15 months, but it appears Sharapova still has a strong mental hold on so many of her opponents.
Makarova had a glorious chance to hit a backhand winner into open court to break for a 6-5 lead, but missed. She then dropped her serve to concede the set, and only won one more game after that.
It was another strong performance by Sharapova, and she then moved to the media centre to make it clear she no longer wishes to discuss the details of her positive test for meldonium.
She says she has done “numerous interviews in the past few months” - which overlooks the fact that journalists and publications, like the fashion magazine Vogue, have been very carefully selected. - BBC
