Parliament to debate 20th Amendment on september 20

The 20th Amendment to the Constitution, which provides for holding the elections for all provincial councils on the same date, will be taken up in Parliament next week.
Parliamentary Business Committee chaired by Speaker Karu Jayasuriya has decided to facilitate a full-day debate on the legislation on September 20 from 10.30 am to 6.30 pm.
The Supreme Court last Friday concluded arguments put forward in support and against the 20th Amendment. The SC determination over the draft bill will be communicated to the Speaker within the next couple of days. Speaker Jayasuriya last week in Parliament announced that he received the copies of 13 petitions filed against the proposed Bill.
The Government is to move several Amendments at the Committee Stage of the Bill. It has been reported that the Government agreed to remove the provision in the bill that enabled Parliament to exercise the powers of the Provincial Councils when they stand dissolved.
The Government has also pledged to hold the Provincial Councils Elections under the new electoral system within 12 months from the date the bill comes into force.
The legislation got through the Sabaragamuwa and Western Provincial Councils this week while it was rejected at the Uva and Southern Provincial Councils late last month.
