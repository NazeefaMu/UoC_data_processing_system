SeylanPahasara’s 130th Library enables access to quality education

In line with its iconic CSR initiative to uplift and empower rural libraries under ‘SeylanPahasara’, Seylan Bank successfully opened its 130th library in the Ampara district and was handed over to the students of R K M Girls School Kalmunai.
