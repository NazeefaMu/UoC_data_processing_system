SLT Speedup Tour - the beginning of a new era for cycling

Seated with Sri Lanka Telecom’s Chief Marketing Officer, Ajantha Seneviratne, it is not difficult to recognize the glow of pride as he describes the post-event results of the “SLT Speedup Sawariya”, which came to an end on the July 31 at the Municipal Grounds in Batticaloa.
“This has been a new and unique experience for all of us at SLT and the feedback we have received following the conclusion of the event has been indescribably positive. It is my belief that value to the sport came not from the value of the prizes or the length of the race, but rather the recognition gained by the cyclists. The skill, dedication and teamwork of the cyclists was truly admirable and the enthusiasm shown by the masses was most encouraging, both to the organizers as well as the participants. This is one of the main reasons why we are determined to take cycling well beyond what was experienced at the “SLT Speedup Sawariya”.
As a company we plan to continue supporting the sport by taking the lead and joining hands with other corporates to aid in the training of cyclists by providing them with modern facilities and the latest technology. It is our intention to bring in the use of telecommunication as a means of tracking the progress of each cyclist during the race. We at SLT believe that the right mix of technology will help raise the standard of cycling to be worthy of recognition on the international racetrack. ”
Seneviratne was not the only one glowing with pride following the “SLT Speedup Sawariya”. The three winners of the men’s race shared their views and experiences in a recent interview.
