Abans donates school supplies  to employees' children

The Abans Welfare Society recently conducted the 7th annual school supply CSR initiative at their Kadolkale Warehouse in Seeduwa.
Over 1000 children of the Abans Group Staff were presented with all their requirements for the new school year. Children, ranging from Montessori level to Grade 12, received shoes, backpacks, lunch boxes, stationery items and other school paraphernalia, which were generously donated by the Abans Group.
The occasion presided under the auspices of Abans Group dignitaries, namely Aban Pestonjee, Chairperson and Dr. Saroshi Dubash, Director, Key senior management and staff from the Abans Group of Companies were present at the event as well.
Drawing from her own life experiences, Pestonjee emphasized the integral role that hard work, perseverance and dedication play in assuring future success, and how fostering these qualities at an early age can lead to more positive academic and career advances later on. She encouraged the children to fully pursue their desired goals and dreams as well as focus on becoming responsible, conscientious Sri Lankan citizens. Pestonjee concluded her speech with a reiteration of Abans’ strong commitment towards ensuring that every child of every socio economic background attains access to a high-quality education.
The event was organized by Ajith Jayasinghe, Deputy Director, Abans Warehousing Division, with the unmitigated support of the Abans Group Directors. Funds were raised for this noteworthy CSR initiative by the collection and sale of used paper.
Kadolkale Warehouse, where the CSR project was held, is an ultra-modern, eco-friendly and tailor-made logistics centre that employs more than 400 employees.
The development of this warehouse was motivated by Abans’ aim of providing their staff members the best facilities, working conditions, and safety benefits possible.
Recognizing that investing in the next generation can foment greater social mobility and improve our local economy, Abans has always placed a strong emphasis on Child Welfare and Youth Development. This is why Abans has developed a CSR policy solely directed towards enhancing Sri Lanka current educational sector as well as offering strenuous support to low-income students. Through these efforts, Abans hopes to help build a highly skilled, educated workforce that will incur positive dividends for our country.
