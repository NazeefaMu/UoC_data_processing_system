Monster movie in the picture

‘Kong: Skull Island’, a 2017 American monster film by Warner Bros. Pictures is a reboot of the King Kong franchise and is the second film in Legendary’s MonsterVerse. It stars an ensemble cast consisting of Tom Hiddleston, Samuel L. Jackson, John Goodman, Brie Larson, Jing Tian, Toby Kebbell, John Ortiz, Corey Hawkins, Jason Mitchell, Shea Whigham, Thomas Mann, Terry Notary and John C. Reilly.
A trip back to the mysterious and dangerous home of the king of the apes, the new film will reportedly follow a team of explorers (led by a character played by Tom Hiddleston), who venture deep inside the treacherous, primordial island to find the leaders brother and a mythical serum, confronting extraordinary creatures along the way. The film returns to the roots of the great monster movies in at least one key respect: it understands the appeal of these movies as a reminder of humanity’s relative insignificance in the face of horrors it can’t possibly comprehend. The distinction of the Kong myth captures the heart and terror of what films like Godzilla which have become so beloved. Every time Kong’s island has been invaded since the dawn of cinema, it’s been by those seeking glory or profit. And now, in the case of Skull Island, it’s time for retribution.
‘Kong: Skull Island’ will be screened at Majestic Cineplex at 10.15 am, 1.15 pm, 4.15 pm, 7.15 pm and Fri/Sat at 10.15 pm and Empire Cineplex at 1.30 pm, 4.30 pm, 7.30 pm and Fri/Sat at 10.30 pm and Sat/Sun at 10.30 am.
