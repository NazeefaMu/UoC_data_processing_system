“One good example of our attempts is the SeylanTikiri Savings account that was launched in 1992. It was the first ever children’s savings account in the country to offer a scheme of gifts for the deposit value.
Over the past years, we have been offering our Seylan Savings Account holders with a range of novel and exciting gifts so that our customers are empowered to save more and develop positive financial habits,” said Tilan Wijeyesekera, Deputy General Manager, Retail Banking at Seylan Bank.
