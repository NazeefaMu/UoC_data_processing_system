Proposals to strengthen workers’ rights to be introduced at SLFP May Day rally

A set of new proposals strengthening workers’ rights will be introduced to the country at the SLFP’s May Day rally in Kandy, SLFP National Youth Front (NYF) Chairman Shantha Bandara said.
“The NYF has included a bundle of proposals which would strengthen workers’ rights,” he said.
Bandara was addressing a NYF media briefing at the SLFP Headquarters yesterday.
He added that the NYF will present the set of proposals to President Maithripala Sirisena during the SLFP’s May Day rally at Getambe, Kandy for his consideration.
Asked what the contents of those proposals are, Bandara said that it would guarantee equal opportunities for every mother at child birth. All mothers should be given equal amount of maternity leave without considering whether they are in the state sector, private sector or in the estate or plantation sector. He added that a mother in the private sector or in the plantation sector doesn’t receive the equal maternity benefits enjoyed by a government servant.
“Besides, the NYF has included a proposal to increase employees’ insurance compensation to Rs.10 million from Rs.5 million,” he said.
Bandara said that the country’s image has improved under this good-governance government. Accordingly, the world is accepting Sri Lanka in a positive manner,unlike during the days of the last regime.
“The image of a country defends on its leader.The balanced and friendly policies of the President has helped the country improve its image,” Bandara said.
When asked about the appointment of new SLFP electoral organisers, he answered that new electorate organisers were appointed to work for the betterment of the party and country.
He said all SLFP organisers who do not attend the May Day rally in Kandy and those who are not assist in their preparations should be removed.
“If one does not assist the party organise its May Day rally or does not attend the rally, it indicates that he or she is not a real SLFP organiser. The May Day rally in Kandy is organised by the SLFP under the chairmanship of the President but May Day rally of the Joint Opposition is organised by a party chaired by G.L Peiris,” he said.
“Inactive and inefficient electoral organisers should be removed from their positions and people who are dedicated to working for the upliftof the party appointed. The party cannot progress unless with people who are creating obstacles to its well-being. The SLFP will never hesitate to appoint new organisers in place of those inactive oganisers and those who violate the party’s constitution,”Bandara added.
