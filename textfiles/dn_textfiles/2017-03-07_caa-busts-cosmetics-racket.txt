CAA busts  cosmetics racket

The Consumer Affairs Authority (CAA) officials has begun a probe on one of the largest cosmetics rackets to be discovered to-date in Wellampitiya .
The latest probes come in the wake of the seizure of the largest contraband of skin cream haul by two alert Consumer Affairs Authority (CAA) officials on March 1 in Wellampitiya.
The CAA estimates the value of seized contraband at around Rs 15.7 million. “These fake creams could have resulted in skin issues and injuries.Thanks to our alert CAA officers, we prevented it,” Industry and Commerce Minister Rishad Bathiudeen said. “I commend CAA and the two CAA investigation officers who successfully completed this risky task.” The CAA teams found the same cream in bulk were re-packaged into smaller retail packs of different Commercial Brands, Golden Pearl, “Pai Me” and “Goree (Made in Pakistan)”, among others.
