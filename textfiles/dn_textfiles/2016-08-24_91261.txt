CA praises Pakistan’s ascension to no.1 in Test ranking

Cricket Australia chief executive James Sutherland has congratulated Pakistan on their rise to the top of world cricket, which has come despite them being unable to play matches on home soil for more than six years.
Pakistan was confirmed as the new number one ranked Test nation on Tuesday following the drawn fourth Test between India and the West Indies in Trinidad, a match the tourists needed to win to remain at the top of the International Cricket Council’s Test rankings.
It’s the first time Pakistan has secured top spot since the rankings were introduced in 2003 and Sutherland says the achievement is even more impressive given they have been forced to play their ‘home’ matches in the United Arab Emirates since 2009 due to security fears.
“I’d just like to acknowledge that effort of Pakistan being the No.1 ranked team for the first time in Test cricket,” Sutherland said.
“It’s quite a remarkable effort and very significant in the context of them not being able to play matches at home.
“And on behalf of everyone in Australian cricket, I say congratulations to Pakistan.”
Pakistan’s new status as Test cricket’s benchmark will be challenged later this year when they travel to the Antipodes for a Test series in New Zealand (featuring Tests in Christchurch and Hamilton in November) and then Australia for matches in Brisbane, Melbourne and Sydney over the festive period.
While Pakistan have a winning record in New Zealand – they’ve lost just five of 29 Tests they’ve played there since 1965 – they will have to reverse more than five decades of history if they are to have success in Australia, where they’ve won just four of 32 Tests.
Pakistan’s next Test assignment is set to be a ‘home’ series against the West Indies in October, the details of which are yet to be determined.
