‘Zero’ to be Sridevi’s last film?

The sudden demise of Bollywood actress Sridevi has left the Indian film industry in shock with many celebrities expressing their grief on social media.
In 2012, she returned to films after a 15-year-long hiatus with Gauri Shinde’s movie ‘English Vinglish’ and was last seen in ‘Mom’ which released last year and according to reports that will not be her last film as she would be seen in Aanand L. Rai’s ‘Zero’ which stars Shah Rukh Khan, Katrina Kaif and Anushka Sharma.
The report also read that Sridevi will be seen making a cameo in the film and would be seen playing herself in the film. The scene is said to be a party scene wherein she will be seen sharing screen space with Shah Rukh, Alia Bhatt and Karisma Kapoor.
Apart from all the hype ‘Zero’ has made due to Shah Rukh’s dwarf look, the film would be looked forward to watching the legendary actress on the silver screen one last time. TNN
