Allianz Lanka launches Suwasahana, ‘Corporate Pension’ plans

Allianz Lanka recently announced the launch of two new unique products that will create greater value for their customers.
The Allianz ‘Suwasahana’ and ‘Corporate Pension’ plans which incorporate a level of convenience and customization that will transform the way people look at and conceive insurance products in the future.
The Suwasahana health plan creates a tailor-made solution to fit the needs of the customer and their family. Suwasahana comes in as a standalone protection plan that provides insurance coverage for hospitalization and in the unfortunate event of death.
The facility includes confirmation of diagnosis, evaluation of cases where a diagnosis is not yet possible, advice on the best course of treatment, and follow-up on a case reported previously without any other limitations to the policyholder.This will allow policyholders to receive a documented medical opinion on a complex, grave or critical illness diagnosis directly from the panel of specialists working in world class medical institutions.
Allianz’s Corporate Pension plan, however, is aimed at companies and entrepreneurs who wish to provide their employees with an attractive benefit package.
This product is the first of its kind in Sri Lanka that provides a comprehensive pension solution exclusively for corporates. Special benefits of the policy include very low and transparent charges unmatchable with existing individual insurance products in the market, flexibility of premium contributions from both the employer and employee.
Surekha Alles, Managing Director, Allianz Insurance Lanka, said, “At Allianz we continue to innovate because we know that the needs of our customers continue to evolve. To ensure that we are meeting those needs and serving our customers better with each new product we keep the customer’s interests central to every step of the development process. This has created some of our most beloved products in the past and now has given us the revolutionary Suwasahana and Corporate Pension plans.”
