[Up & Under with Chandrishan Perera]
Kandy the team to beat

The national club season is just starting to gather momentum - running pretty much to form; with no major surprises in week 4...there was much speculation about the top contenders. Can CR be a force? Will Havelocks have enough muscle under Tavita Lagga Tulsgesi?
Can Kandy thrive with as many National caps under coach Sean Wijesinghe? How effective will a new look Police be in the middle, can the names add to their powerhouse plan with a marauding Bilal Hassen in such good form?
Burning questions for the masses of fans that make local rugby a colourful local popularity contender.
Naturally the season is unkind to slow starters and teams that cannot rely on their endurance fitness, the big names asserting their skill impact, right from the outset - particularly the national 7s players - Fazil M, Nigel R, Srinath S, Sandun H, Danushka R, Wiliwara, Dinusha C, Gayan R and recently returned Shenal D.
The 2015/16 season needs Army, Navy and Air Force to be teams that have the ability to push all sides to the wire - they must add a dimension of surprise, to a league that needs magic, needs fliers, needs spectacular tries and massive impact tackles to pepper the fans imagination and win new young hearts to the union code, especially given the absolutely massive Rugby World Cup in sunny England. How impressive the quality of rugby warrior, on and off the field, how amazing the millions who watched and what a brilliant future for the game.
The domestic season cert has a lot to offer families, school leavers and fans, the local players given opportunity to skill shine and dazzle, new stars, new names, fabulous indeed.
Week 5 - Kandy superior, classy, experienced - the team to beat. Travel to the capitol to meet CR. Expect a bruising 80 mins and plenty of defence from the Longdon Place Red shirts. In form three quarters for Kandy will dictate the pace and magic,
This Dec Sat: Army v Havies will be closer but the park warriors will control the game with a game plan to contain the fitter Army who unfortunately lack experience.
Navy v Police is bound to be a real battle both teams equally capable of grabbing the bonus points at full time. Team leadership might be the difference to get over the line.
18th Dec: CR v Kandy, @ Longdon Place 4pm ko. 18th Dec: CH v Airforce @ venue to be announced .4pm ko . 20th Dec Army v Havelocks @ Army grounds 4pm ko. 20th Dec: Navy v Police @ Welisara 4pm ko.
Enjoy the confrontation in week 5 and marvel at the homegrown talent on offer in the middle. Club loyalties must be protected; must have meaning. Let’s wish the gladiators maximum impact and plenty for us fans to cheer this pre-Xmas weekend. Wear your club colours with pride.
Cheers islanders. Bula bula Sri Rugby !!!
