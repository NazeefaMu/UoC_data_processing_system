Akkaraipattu pavement hawkers appeal for proper place to sell goods

The pavement hawkers in the Akkaraipattu Municipal area have no proper place to sell their products, clothes, textile, consumer articles, vegetables and other essential food stuffs.
There is an increase in the sale of goods in the Akkaraipattu area in the Ampara district, brought from other districts.
The towns have turned into a hive of activity. Large numbers of pavement hawkers from other districts have come into this district and are selling goods at cheap rates.
Both sides of the main roads are illuminated with bulbs by payment hawkers to attract the crowd.
Therefore, the pavement hawkers urge the authorities to allocate a particular place to exhibit and sell their products without further delay.
