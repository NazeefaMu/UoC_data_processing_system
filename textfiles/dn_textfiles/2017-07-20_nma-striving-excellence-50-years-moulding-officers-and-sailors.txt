NMA, striving for excellence 50 years of moulding Officers and Sailors

Seafaring is a unique skill and a resplendent art only brave men can accomplish. Naval activities, is said to date back thousands of years, to 8200 BC.
The Sri Lanka Navy is believed to be the only Navy in the world in the recent past, that fought a ruthless terrorist organisation and defeated the LTTE, which possessed a well-developed militia and carried out many high-profile attacks.
Where were the personnel of the Sri Lanka Navy trained to acquire discipline to such an extent?
It is none other than the Naval and Maritime Academy (NMA) in Trincomalee which celebrates the completion of fifty years in service. It has been the Alma Mater to almost all the Naval Officers and the Sailors in the Sri Lanka Navy.
History of the NMA
Although the Naval and Maritime Academy, is situated in the picturesque and warm Naval Dockyard bordered by the Trincomalee natural harbour in the Eastern Coast at present, its roots run up to chilly Diyathalawa, a former garrison town in the central highlands of Sri Lanka.
The Sri Lanka Navy we have today was created at first as the Ceylon Naval Volunteer Force (CNVF) in January, 1938. Three years later, the CNVF was accepted by the Royal Navy (RN) of Great Britain, as a Volunteer Reserve and renamed as “Ceylon Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve”, or CRNVR. After Independence from British rule in 1948, the government believed an island nation should possess a strong Navy to be its first line of defence. Therefore, on December 9,1950 the Royal Ceylon Navy was created. Later, in 1972, the ‘Dominion of Ceylon’ became the ‘Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka” and the ‘Royal Ceylon Navy’ became the ‘Sri Lanka Navy’. Finally, ‘Her Majesty’s Ceylon Ships’ (H.M.Cy.S.) became ‘Sri Lanka Navy Ships’ (SLNS).
Early history
In 1965, HMCyS Parakrama II was established in Naval Dockyard, Trincomalee to conduct recruit training whilst HMCyS Tissa was providing the administrative support.
It was in 1966 that vital awareness of maritime aspects came up. Its paramount significance and value began to surface in order to have a proper formal Naval training academy. The Dockyard in Trincomalee of all places was decided the most apposite location and swiftly the massive task of designing, planning and creating an institute was initiated. The Instructor Commander M.G.S. Perera was entrusted to shoulder the proceedings. He was not only assigned the strenuous task of transforming the old neglected buildings at Dockyard but also to give life to an Academy to achieve this goal.
The outcome was the birth of Naval and Maritime Academy, the NMA on January 15, 1967. It turned out to be the vital beginning to a long journey ahead.
NMA was then formally commissioned on July 15, 1967. Since then, it trained not only generations of officers and sailors of the Navy but personnel from Fisheries Corporation, Police Department and also Merchant Navy Cadets for the Ceylon Shipping Corporation. Many of those then trained at NMA went to sea with ‘NMA’ Certificates.
When the Naval and Maritime Academy was formally commissioned on July 15th, 1967 there were only five departments; Nautical, Engineering, Electrical, Communication and Supply Department.
Course made good
The nautical school was created under four pillars namely Gunnery, Anti-Submarine Warfare, Seamanship and Navigation. Over the last five decades, the Naval and Maritime Academy has expanded and improved its facilities and capability to meet the dimensions of the Navy’s requirement to internationally accepted standards.
The first recruit batch and the first officer cadet batch were trained at NMA in 1968 and 1969 respectively. Beginning from the first intake, training of officer cadets and other officer under trainees came under the aegis of the Nautical school which was responsible for training of recruits, as well as for conducting training on Nautical science including Navigation, Seamanship, Gunnery and Underwater warfare for all officer under trainees and sailors following advanced courses. With the expansion of the Navy which resulted in frequent and larger intakes of officers, as well as the paucity of foreign berths for Sub Lieutenant Technical Courses, the number of Officer Under Trainees (OUTs) at NMA increased exponentially, and so did the training courses for trainees. Therefore, the Nautical school found it difficult to meet the training needs in an efficient and effective manner, and the Navy decided to establish a separate unit within the NMA soley to conduct and coordinate all training matters pertaining to OUTs . The Officer Training Wing was set up for this purpose in 1990.
With this, the disintegration of the Nautical school in to the specializations of Gunnery, Anti-Submarine Warfare and Seamanship and Navigation along with the language and Computer department came in to being. As at today, there are 22 schools and 02 training supporting units in the Naval & Maritime Academy to conduct its training, and has the capacity to train 2000 trainees including both officers and sailors. NMA currently conducts Sub Lieutenant Technical Courses for Executive, Logistics, NPM and Provost branch officers, in addition to training of Officer Under Trainees of Cadet Entry, KDU Entry and Direct Entry (Degree holders) and Service Entry.
The training facilities and infrastructure was uplifted recently to meet the modern day international standards. The new building complex was added to the NMA training facilities by June 2015 and the building complex encompasses Seamanship, Anti- Submarine Warfare, Navigation, Merchant Marine Training, Engineering, Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Provost, Physical Training , English and Information Technology Schools. These three storeyed buildings are equipped with required facilities to impart training in order to achieve the Navy’s vision to enhance the training quality and capacity. The building complex has spacious multi class rooms, Navigation Bridge Simulator, Chart rooms, Model rooms, Practical rooms and state-of-the art Technological, Computer and Language laboratories. Further, the new facility has administration spaces in par with international standards.
The motto “The disciplined are the noblest of men” is conceptually leading the institution to the exact target. Accomplishments of Sri Lanka Navy over the past decades bear testimony to the effective quality of training imparted on those who walked through the portals of the Academy.
Courses conducted at NMA
Having a Navy proper is of a boundless importance for our island nation. Building up such a Navy means building up individuals to be Naval personnel to achieve perfection or rather close perfection. It is not an overnight task and needs numerous attributes to cater to that. The future Navy is built here at the academy with a clear vision and perfect mission. Thus the NMAis conducting many pre-service and in-service courses. The training for Naval ratings encompasses courses for phase III (branch qualifying course) and advanced training comprised of branch training, specialization training, mechanical and technical training. NMA also conducts specialized training courses for the Sri Lanka Army, Sri Lanka Air Force, Sri Lanka Police and civil institutions such as Ceylon Shipping Corporation and Fisheries Corporation from time to time when requested.
Officer Training Wing (OTW) is the heart of the Academy. It provides basic officer training for newly joined cadets and all types of entries. The Cadet Entry training was accredited to the esteemed University of Kelaniya in the year 2001, and at present is accredited to the General sir John Kotelawala Defence University since 2011 for the award of BSc degrees.
At NMA, twenty-two separate schools and three departments have been established to teach various subjects related to Naval warfare. Naval subjects such as Seamanship, Navigation, Gunnery, Communication and Anti-Submarine Warfare are taught in different schools. Technical subjects such as Engineering, Electrical and Electronic Engineering are taught to all the officer-under-trainees and sailors in the relevant branches. The Civil Engineering school was established recently to conduct basic and advanced training courses for sailors in the Civil Engineering Branch.
Supply and Secretariat School conducts basic and advanced courses for Stores Assistants, Writers, Mess Assistants and Catering Assistants. The Diving School conducts basic and advanced courses for sailors of the diving branch and basic diving module for Officer Under Trainees. The combat diving courses are conducted for Sri Lanka Navy Special Boats Squadron, Sri Lanka Army Commandos and Special Forces. Physical Training School conducts Qualifying and Advanced Courses for Physical Training Instructors for various sports disciplines.
In order to train the young trainees to take up challenges both at sea and on land, the Combat Training Unit, Marksmanship and Sniper Training School and Provost and Regulating School were established. English Language Teaching School, General Education Department and Information Technology School work in order to mould Navy’s young generation into a professional force with effective communication ability.
One of the greatest achievements of the Academy was the inauguration of Merchant Marine Training School. The naval personnel, who wish to join the merchant ships after their retirement from the Navy follow these courses conducted here and obtain an internationally recognised certificate. The fully-fledged Nuclear Biological Chemical Defense, Damage Control and Fire-fighting School gives practical training on fire-fighting and damage control to secure their safety at daily Naval routine.
The Long Logistics Management Course is the most advanced course conducted at the NMA leading to an MBA degree. It is accredited to the Kotelawala Defence University.
With the view of maintaining high standards in staff duties, NMA conducts the Junior Naval Staff Course (JNSC).
