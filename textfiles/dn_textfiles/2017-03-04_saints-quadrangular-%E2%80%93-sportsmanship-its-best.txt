The Saints Quadrangular – sportsmanship at its best

Over 200 of the best athletes from the four Catholic schools that comprises the Saints Quadrangular namely St. Anthony’s College Katugastota, established in 1854, St. Benedict’s College Kotahena, established in 1865, St. Joseph’s College Darley Road, established in 1896, and St. Peter’s College Bambalapitiya, established in 1927 participated in the 2017 Saints Quadrangular held at St Peter’s College grounds on February 25 and 26.
The event hosted by St. Benedict’s College with the active and energetic support of the management and leadership of the four schools and their old boys was a spectacular show where the four leading schools, came together with the spirit of camaraderie to compete with one another. Spirited and competitive athletes in the sprints, relay teams, jumping events and throwing events participated to show off their individual and team skills.
There were large numbers of old boys from the four schools cheering their athletes and participating in the old boy’s events.
Rectors, Rev Fr Henry Bernard Wijetunge of St. Anthony’s College, Rev Fr Travis Gabriel of St Joseph’s College, Rev Fr Trevor Martin of St Peter’s College, and Rev Br Henry Dissanayake of St Benedict’s College graced the occasion.
The Chief Guest of the event was Old Ben Luke de Silva, founder member of the Old Bens Alumni, New York, USA.
Athletics has always played a very important role in the history of the four schools and a great deal of prominence is given to nurture the sport and the track and field events.
The four schools continue to make significant investments to athletics with coaches, techniques, nutrition, equipment, and scholarships for promising athletes.

HISTORY
The collective effort of the four schools in organizing this event is commended.
History tells us that the Quadrangular was mooted by the members of the Old Bens Sports Club.
We are informed that the invitation was extended to many schools to participate, but it was St. Anthony’s, St Joseph’s and St. Peter’s that accepted the invitation.
Since then it has grown in stature, competition, and friendship.
The Saints Quadrangular goes back to 50 years of friendship and camaraderie where each school takes turn in hosting the event by playing cricket, basketball, soccer and rugby between the present boys and old boys.
The four schools are known to have produced some of Sri Lanka’s best sporting talent, some of whom have gone on to perform at the national and international stage in the fields of cricket, rugby, soccer, basketball, and hockey. Here are four leading Catholic schools coming together in the spirit of sports to nurture talent to represent their respective alma maters and the country.
The Saints Athletics Quadrangular was revived after a lapse of almost 25 years by St. Peter’s College in 2015 during which year St Benedict’s College celebrated its sesquicentennial. The schools thank the Sri Lanka Athletics Federation officials, St. John Ambulance Cadet Services of St Benedict’s College, sponsors and well-wishers, coaches, parents, and all participating athletes for a fabulous show.
St Anthony’s College will host next year’s athletics meet in the cooler climes of Katugastota, Kandy.
