She’s got Diana’s eyes!'

Royal fans claim Princess Charlotte looks JUST like her late grandmother as a child in family portraits taken on Prince Louis’ christening day
She has her likeness to the Queen pointed out on many occasions but royal fans have spotted Princess Charlotte's uncanny resemblance to another of royal relative.
Following her appearance at Prince Louis' christening royal watchers have pointed out the similarities between three-year-old Charlotte and her late grandmother Princess Diana.
Instagram account loveprincessdiana shared a photo of Lady Di at a similar age to her granddaughter that appeared in her passport as a child.
One wrote, 'Charlotte is her mini me!' while another added 'Exactly the same!'
Another commented: 'I have been saying for a while now - Charlotte is going to look a lot more like Diana than anyone thinks...'
However, others agreed that it was their mouths that were identical in the two photos rather than their eyes.
'Look at the lips in both these pictures. Those are almost identical.' commented one royal fan. However, others were still insistent that Charlotte resembles her great-grandmother, the Queen the most.
Royal watchers first commented on how much young Charlotte looks like the Queen, following the release of the Cambridge's Christmas card in December last year.
It was also noted that the pictures of Charlotte taken at her nursery in January show her looking like her great-great-grandmother, the late Queen Mother, as well as her own mother the Duchess of Cambridge at the same age.
And it's not just members of the royal family that Charlotte has previously been compared to - with some social media users spotting an uncanny resemblance to TV presenter Kirstie Allsop.
