Panel discussion  on ‘Nationalism’

Elizabeth Moir School recently hosted a panel discussion on ‘Nationalism’. The members of the panel were Dr. Harsha De Silva MP, State Minister of National Policies and Economic Affairs; Dr. Dinusha Panditaratne, Executive Director of the Lakshman Kadirgamar Institute; and Priyanga Hettiarachchi, Sri Lanka Representative of the Westminster Foundation. The discussion was moderated by two students, Shakuntala Fernandopulle and Felix Deemer.
The panelists were asked questions on a wide range of issues linked to Nationalism. This included the merits of free trade and rise of protectionism, the danger of a new era of national rivalries causing conflict between great powers, the implications of China’s Belt and Road Initiative for Sri Lanka, and the continuing prevalence of ethnic nationalism, both around the world and in relation to the recent communal violence in Kandy.
Dr. Harsha De Silva argued that the Belt and Road Initiative was a strategic opportunity for Sri Lanka, given the potential economic benefits, but also discussed President Xi Jinping’s recent abolition of term limits for the Chinese presidency.
Dr. Panditaratne questioned the view that Sri Lanka is in a debt trap to China, saying that only 6 percent of Sri Lanka’s total debt is owed to China, about the same as what is owed to Japan. On free trade, she argued that Sri Lanka should follow the example of countries like New Zealand, which are reaching out to educate their citizens about the Trans-Pacific Partnership, so people see how they benefit from free trade agreements.
Hettiarachchi discussed how Nationalism appeals to everyone’s desire for a sense of belonging and community but distinguished positive or harmless manifestations of this, such as supporting one’s country in the Olympics or World Cup, from exploitation of these feelings to create divisions.
All the speakers emphasised the dangers of politicians drumming up nationalist sentiment for political ends and turning their back on the co-operation that has brought unprecedented peace and prosperity to the world since 1945. They called on leaders to develop a civic nationalism by emphasising what unites countries and different communities rather than sowing discord.
The school’s students were enlightened about many important contemporary issues and inspired to fight for a more open world by building bridges between different peoples and not building walls.
