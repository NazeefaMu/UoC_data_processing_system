Benefits for officers managing EPF

The Employees Provident Fund (EPF) is the largest ever social security fund in South Asia but officers who manage the fund do not receive due recognition or facilities, Labour and Trade Union Relations Minister W. D. J. Seneviratne said.
Minister Seneviratne said the fund did not create by itself. It was created by hardworking officers and contributors. They do not receive anything (a payment or other benefit) as recognition for their service.
Therefore, attention has been paid to provide them benefits such as a payment, vehicles for concessionary prices etc.
The minister was addressing the gathering after opening a new building at the Labour Secretariat in Avissawella, recently.Minister Seneviratne pointed out that 200 new labour officers will be recruited soon to provide a better service to the people. Several new buildings have been constructed for labour secretariats in various districts. “People’s valuable time should not be wasted when they arrive in the secretariat to get their labour problems solved,” the minister said.Labour and Trade Union Relations Ministry Secretary Nimal Saranatissa, politicians in the area and others spoke.
