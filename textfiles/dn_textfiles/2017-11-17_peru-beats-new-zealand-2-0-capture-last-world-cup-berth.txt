Peru beats  New Zealand 2-0  to capture last World Cup berth

LIMA: Jefferson Farfan and Christian Ramos scored as Peru defeated New Zealand to reach the World Cup for the first time since 1982 on Wednesday, sealing the last ticket to Russia with a 2-0 win.
Farfan struck in the 27th minute and Ramos scored in the 65th to give “Los Incas” their fifth overall World Cup finals appearance and the first in 35 years.
The second-leg match at Lima’s Estadio Nacional was the decider after New Zealand and Peru played to a 0-0 draw in the first leg of their Oceania-South America playoff on Saturday at Wellington.
New Zealand, ranked 122nd in the world, was seeking a third World Cup finals berth after appearances in 1982 and 2010.
Peru attacked the “All-Whites” from the start, Incas defender Luis Advincula slamming a left-footed shot off the crossbar in the third minute to delight a full-throated crowd in the packed stadium.
The opening goal came after Christian Cueva raced down the left wing and flicked a pinpoint center pass with the outside of his right foot to Farfan.
The 33-year-old forward for Lokomotiv Moscow blasted a right-footed shot from the edge of the penalty area past New Zealand goalkeeper Stefan Marinovic and into the back of the net. AFP
