Exploring digital frontier of HNB’s innovative trade services

HNB has been deeply entwined with the island’s trade providing essential trade and advisory services to importers and exporters alike for over 130 years.
The nature of global trade and commerce is changing at an exponentially faster pace, facilitated by the rapid emergence of new technologies and business models, that are increasingly global in scale.
According to HNB, Assistant General Manager Trade and Financial Institutions, Janath Ilangantileke, these changes bring with them fresh opportunities to tap into global trade and strong economic development nationally.
“Trade in international markets can often seem like a daunting challenge for Sri Lankan enterprises as such transactions are usually accompanied with complicated International rules and extensive documentation. The most basic of transactions, would require a very good knowledge of International Chamber of Commerce rules such as UCP 600, URC 522 and International Commercial (INCO) terms to ensure that each transaction is completed without any difficulty,” he explained.
“Most of the other banks operating in this space tend to offer a similar range of services, but where HNB really stands ahead, is in terms of our strategy of adding meaningful value to our clients at every stage. We have easily the largest number of technically qualified staff and Certified Documentary Credit Specialists (CDCS) in the industry and we use this wealth of knowledge to provide advisory services that go above and beyond what is typically found in the trade business,” Ilangantileke stated.
In keeping with its mission to provide the most comprehensive support to trade business clients, HNB maintains a 24 hour response service with dedicated personnel, who will take calls from customers any time of the day and who possess the extensive knowledge required to resolve any issue quickly and conveniently.
Country’s International Trade Business is expected to grow, due to the increased economic activity from the many development projects and greater focus on Exports.
Catering to a wide variety of clients from large Corporates to businesses in the Mid-Market and SME sector, HNB’s next major priority is in facilitating the complete digitization of trade services with a view of promoting sharp efficiency gains, that will support the drastic up scaling of international trade coming to Sri Lanka over the medium to long term.
HNB has reinforced the partnership with Trade clients in their adaptation to digitalization by guiding them through every step of their first transaction, explaining each process and the safeguards in place along the way to ensure that every transaction is completed safely, quickly and with complete ease.
In order to further reassure customers of the service standards , HNB Trade Service operations were the first to secure ISO Certification in year 2004 and have since been upgraded to ISO 9001:2015 status, following stringent audits by M/s Bureau Veritas.
“HNB’s local relationships in the trade services sector is further complemented by extensive international partnerships with a global network of over 800 correspondent banks whom we regularly interact, in order to ensure that HNB and our clients can transact with the global partners with seamless ease”, Ilangantileke stated.
