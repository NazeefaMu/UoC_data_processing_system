The Colombo High Court rejected the bail application filed by National Freedom Front (NFF) Leader Wimal Weerawansa today.
The former Minister was arrested on January 10 for allegedly misusing 40 vehicles belonging to the State Engineering Corporation (SEC) while functioning as the Housing, Construction and Engineering Services Minister incurring a loss of Rs. 91 million to the government.
