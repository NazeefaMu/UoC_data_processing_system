Two Pakistan ships on goodwill visit

Pakistan Maritime Security Ships HINGOL and BASOL will arrive at Colombo Port for a four-day port call from January 5 to 8 in a display of brotherly relationship between Pakistan and Sri Lanka. These calls are aimed at strengthening the existing relationship between the two countries. Mission Commander Ashfaq Ali will pay courtesy call on Commanders of the Navy, Coast Guard and Western Naval Area. The two ships will take part in professional maritime drills with their Sri Lankan counterparts besides playing friendly basketball/volleyball matches.
