Water sports festival in Chilaw

A water sports festival will be held in Chilaw in November this year in which local and foreign competitors will take part in surfing, sailing, rafting, wind surfing, yachting and kayaking.
Participants from Britain, France, Germany, Netherlands, Italy, Sweden, United States, Canada, New Zealand and Japan are expected to compete at this festival which has been organised by the Asian German Sports Exchange Programme in collaboration with the Ministry of Tourism. The festival will help to promote Chilaw and the surrounding areas as a tourist destination. The organisers also hope to set up training centres for youths in the Puttalam District in servicing and maintaining sailing boats and yachts.
