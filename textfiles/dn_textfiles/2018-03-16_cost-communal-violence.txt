Cost of communal violence

The entire nation is weeping today due to the absurd communal riots that took place in Ampara and Kandy. It is human nature that having done the blunder worrying about the adverse effects of a bad deed. The violence cost a number of houses, business establishments, public properties and most importantly precious human lives. Neither the rioters nor the victims will benefit from these ugly incidents.
This communal disharmony has created many problems for the country and people. First, these incidents have tarnished the country’s reputation among the world nations and United Nations. Sri Lanka is just recovering from the three-decade civil war that has caused an incurable scar and a huge loss for the country and the people.
On the other hand, the government has to spend millions of rupees to compensate the victims. This is a heavy burden for the country especially as the government is seeking funds and assistance to invest in the development projects underway to boost the country’s economy.
Another blow to the government is the sudden drop in tourist arrivals. As far as tourism is concerned in Sri Lanka, it is one of the major sources of income. Countries like America, Britain and France have already requested their people to rethink about the journey to Sri Lanka due to the recent racist behaviour of the people.
This is a conflict among people. Why do we have to burn the business organisations and houses and religious places? There is no sound logic between the arson and misbehaviour of the rioters. The rioters must think about their act of setting fire to properties and killing people. That will never ever bring an effective and everlasting solution for our bitterness or conflicts. The country has already faced two communal riots: 1983 and 2014. In these three communal clashes, valuable properties and business establishments were destroyed.
Besides, it cost the life of innocent people. It paved the way for misunderstanding among communities and to further animosity and hatred. Hatred cannot bring peace. Nor can it set the way for peaceful co-existence in the country.
Instead of hatred, the religious leaders, politicians and peacemakers should sow the seeds of love in the minds of people who have grown hatred and misunderstanding of their fellow countrymen. Another giant obstruction for the amicable peaceful collective life is the social media.
Every modern invention is a good servant but a bad master. The social media has made the incident worst in the country. It was like adding fuel to the burning house.
We human beings have got an extra sense to think before acting. So whenever we receive messages via social media we must always think about the authenticity of the message or news because rumour has wings and will make huge destructions.
Hence, let us make a strenuous effort to bring back peace to the country for us to live as the children of Mother Lanka.
