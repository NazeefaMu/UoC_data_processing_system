Postal workers strike disrupts mail services in the Batticaloa district

 
All the post offices of Batticaloa district have been closed completely due to the strike launched by postal workers.
Postal workers launched a 48-hour token strike on June 12.
 The protest is against the Nuwara-Eliya, Kandy and Galle post offices to tourism offices, several work related issues at the Head Office in Colombo, not activating and reforming the service constitution and several other management issues.
The media spokesperson said that the strike would continue if necessary steps are not taken by June 26 midnight.
