I was able to change a corrupt electoral process: Faiszer

I was able to change a corrupt electoral process and give a rightful place to those deserving and reform the entire social system. With the blessings of President Maithripala Sirisena and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe, with great difficulty, I was able to change this corrupt electoral process, said Provincial Councils and Local Government Minister Faiszer Musthapha.
He said so addressing the media on the historical political achievement with the introduction for the 20th amendment to the constitution, yesterday.
According to political commentators, this act will become a reason for a great revolution in the field of politics.
With the introduction of 25 percent women’s representation, the voice of women in Parliament will be increased and we can expect a new political culture where morality and justice will prevail.
"I am thankful to the Secretary to the Ministry of Provincial Councils and Local Government, Cabinet ministers of the Government, Chairman of the Election Commission, delimitation committee who helped me to succeed in this endeavor and those who encouraged me by their criticisms," he added.
"I respectfully thank everyone who gave me the strength in this process. Everyone was a source of strength to me. I did all of these for the people of the country," he said.
Because of my actions today, I believe that in the future, we will have an intelligent political generation. Especially we have achieved a big victory in introducing 25 percent women’s representation. I believe that where there are women present, the opportunities for corruption will be reduced," the minister said.
