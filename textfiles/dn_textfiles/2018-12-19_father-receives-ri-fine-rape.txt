Father receives RI, fine for rape

A father who had been found guilty of raping his daughter, was sentenced to 30 years’ rigorous imprisonment(RI) and fined Rs. 30,000 by Kurunegala High Court Judge Menaka Wijesundara on Monday.
In addition to the rigorous imprisonment, the Judge ordered him to pay Rs. 75,000 as compensation to the victim. The accused, a resident of Kuliyapitiya was indicted for sexually abusing the 17-year-old daughter on January 23, 2009. State Counsel Charaka Dharmasiri told the Court that this kind of an offence needed to be followed under section 368 of the Ceylon Criminal Procedure code No. 22 of 1995. The Judge delivered the judgement in open court.
