CSL-CER opens at Ruhuna University

A new building for the China-Sri Lanka Joint Centre for Education and Research (CSL-CER) was inaugurated at the University of Ruhuna (UOR) with the aim of strengthening marine science and research in the country, the UOR said in a statement on Saturday.
The CSL-CER is handled by the UOR and the South China Sea Institute of Oceanology of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS)—an outcome of a national-level cooperation agreement signed in 2014.
It is also the CAS' first overseas research centre on marine sciences.
According to the statement, the CAS had granted opportunities to more than 20 Sri Lankan students to pursue their PhD/Master's degrees on marine sciences in CAS research institutes during the past three years. The CAS, along with the UOR and other Sri Lankan agencies, will push the centre to play a bigger role in international cooperation on marine sciences and education in the Indian Ocean region.
Chinese Academy of Sciences Vice President Hou Jianguo said the CAS would continue to promote comprehensive cooperation for science and education using the newly-launched ocean observation platform.
UOR Acting Vice Chancellor Nayana Alagiyawanna said the joint observation system of the tropical marine environment set up by the CAS and the UOR a few years ago had put the UOR on in important position in the field of marine research in Sri Lanka.
