JVP vehemently opposes Rideemaliyadda sugar factory
JVP Leader and Chief Opposition Whip Anura Kumara Dissanayake yesterday in Parliament, vehemently opposed the proposal to grant 65,000 acres in Rideemaliyadda to a foreign company to start a sugar factory.
Moving an Adjournment Motion in the House, the MP urged the Government not to proceed with the proposed Uva-Wellassa Sugar Industry project also highlighting its detrimental impact on the environment, archaeological heritage and the lives of the people of the area.
He said President Maithripala Sirisena has presented a Cabinet Paper on this project on.
Dissanayake pointed out the initial proposal in this regard was made in 2006 and the former Government had obtained environmental approval to it by force. “The proposed strip of land is located in between Nilgala and Maduruoya reserves.
About seven archaeological sites are located in that area.
The proposed project damages the entire eco-system and aggravates the human-elephant conflict.
We demand a comprehensive Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) covering the whole area of this project,” he said. He said the project was aimed at producing 80,000 metric tonnes of sugar, adding that it requires 2.8 million litres of water on the first day of its operation. “How are you going to get this water? Is it from Maduru Oya? This is a very large factory.
Even though we join Hingurana, Kanthale, Sevanagala and Pelawatte sugar factories together, the extent of land would be less than 40,000 acres, but this factory has an extent of 65,000 acres,” he said.
The MP said the Government was going to distribute 5 acres each for 7,500 farmers with the condition of cultivating only sugar cane, adding that this would in turn make them labourers of the factory.
He called on the Government to stop this project and follow an environmental friendly development approach when utilizing those lands.
Opposition envious of development taking place in Badulla district :Harin
An investment of US$ 152 million had never been made in the history of the Badulla district, said Telecommunication and Digital Infrastructure Minister Harin Fernando in Parliament yesterday.
He also said that the Opposition members envious of the massive development taking place in the district.
He added that not only the sugar factory, but a number of other factories and renewable energy plants would be set up in Rideemaliyadda.
The Minister made this observation joining the Adjournment Motion moved by Chief Opposition Whip and JVP Parliamentarian Anura Kumara Dissanayake, demanding to stop construction of the Sugar factory in Rideemaliyadda.
"Rideemaliyadda is the second poorest Divisional Secretariat in the country," the Minister said.
"The youth in Rideemaliyadda go to Colombo to work as labourers in construction sites and as security guards.
Those people do not stand against these projects, but those of the Opposition who are envy of the government's programmes to serve the people."
Govt has released 5,000 acres of land to people in N/E: Kiriella
The Unity Government has released 5,000 acre of land in the Northern and Eastern Provinces to the people, said Leader of the House and Highways and Higher Education Minister Lakshman Kiriella in Parliament yesterday.
He added that everything was ready to release another extent of another 3,000 acres to the people in the N/E.
He made these observations yesterday in response to a special statement made by EPDP Leader Douglas Devananda under Standing Order 23(2), requesting the government to grant deeds of 800 acres in Trincomalee to 2,200 families. Minister Kiriella said MP Devananda should acknowledge that the government had granted 5,000 acres to the people there.
"Do you acknowledge it?" Minister Kiriella queried from MP Devananda. "Yes I accept it," said MP Devananda. "But this is another issue." "
No information concerning gold belonging to Tamil people in refugee camps: Minister Karunathilake
The Prison Reforms, Rehabilitation, Resettlement and Hindu Religious Affairs Ministry yesterday, informed Parliament that it did not not possess any information on the gold belonging to Tamil people who were in refugee camps.
The Ministry made the above observation in response to a question by UPFA MP Vasudeva Nanayakkara. MEP Leader Dinesh Gunawardena asked the question as MP Nanayakkara was absent and the Chief Government Whip and Minister Gayantha Karunathilake tabled the answer on behalf of subject Minister D M Swaminathan.
MP Nanayakkara has asked “whether a large quantity of gold belonging to the Tamil people who were living in Refugee camps after the war, was deposited anywhere in a trust and whether these deposits were enumerated, whether there were complaints that their gold had not been returned to them so far and the steps taken by the government to settle these claims.” The Ministry in its reply said it does not have any such information.
UNP and UPFA had no discussions to set up unity rule at LG elections: Minister Amaraweera
The objective of the UPFA is to set up a government of its own in 2020, said UPFA General Secretary and Fisheries and Aquatic Resources Development Minister Mahinda Amaraweera in Parliament yesterday.
He said that several newspapers had carried a news report that the UPFA was attempting to establish a unity rule at Local Government Institutions as well which is not true. Minister Amaraweera made this observation speaking during the Adjournment Motion.
He said the people do not need to be misled.
"The UPFA and the UNP had not discussed to set up unity rule at local institutions level or at the next election in 2020," Minister Amaraweera said.
The Minister further said that the country had imported sugar to the value of US$ 343 million last year too. Sri Lanka is one of the countries which has a high sugar consumption. He said that due to this reason, the country had to produce the sugar it needed.
"Although the Opposition says 65,000 acres of land had been given, it is incorrect," the Minister said.
"Only 40,000 acres would be given. The required reports have been already taken to assure the protection of the environment."
He also said that there were two sugar factories in the country and there was a need of another. He added that the Sevanagala and Pelwatta towns were developed with the setting up of the factories. He added that the jobs created with the setting up of this factory would come to the Uva Province.
