Mahatma Gandhi scholarships awarded to 150 AL students

The Mahatma Gandhi Scholarships for 2016-17 were awarded to 150 Advanced Level school students from all 25 districts across Sri Lanka.
The Mahatma Gandhi Scholarship, a merit-cum-means based scholarship instituted in 2006-07 for Sri Lankan students, is awarded annually by the Indian High Commission in cooperation with the Education Ministry.
Recipients receive cash assistance during their two years of ‘A’ level studies. The High Commission has increased the scholarship amount from Rs 2,000 to 2,500 per month from 2015-16 onwards and accordingly; this year’s awardees will receive Rs. 30,000 annually during their two years of ‘A’ level studies.
The High Commissioner spoke of the transformation taking place in India in the fields of Science and Technology, Agriculture, Space Research, Education and Health. The students numbering 150 (six each from 25 districts) were selected in April 2017 by a joint selection committee comprising officials from the Indian High Commission and the Education Ministry based on the performance of students in the ‘O’ level examinations and an interview. Apart from this, India is providing opportunities to young Sri Lankans to study in reputed Indian Institutions of higher education through more than 270 scholarships per year, besides providing 370 short-term training slots every year to working professionals from Sri Lanka under ITEC programme.
