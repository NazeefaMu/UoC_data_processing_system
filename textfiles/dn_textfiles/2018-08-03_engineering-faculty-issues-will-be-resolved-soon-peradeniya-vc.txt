Engineering Faculty issues will be resolved soon: Peradeniya VC

Peradeniya University Vice Chancellor Prof. Upul Dissanayake yesterday said the issues of the Engineering faculty will be resolved within three days.
He said the University administration is discussing the issues with the student representatives.
“We will resolve four of five issues raised by the students soon,” he said. The university students boycotted lectures and conducted protests after the university administration decided not to allow the Engineering Faculty students who do not have 80 per cent attendance to sit for examinations.
