Buddha Sasana Karya Mandalaya on proposed new Constitution
It is reported, the Buddha Sasana Karya Mandalaya [BSKM] has objected to their placement words ‘The Republic of Sri Lanka’ with the word ‘Sri Lanka’. Let us critically analyse what is in the existing constitution which reads – ‘CHAPTER II -Buddhism-9 – The Republic of Sri Lanka shall give to Buddhism the foremost place and accordingly it shall be the duty of the State to protect and foster the Buddha Sasana while assuring to all religions the rights granted by Article 10 and 14[1][e]’.
If one critically analyse and understand the words Buddha Sasana it includes or encompasses the Buddhist clergy. Under the guise of protecting and fostering Buddhism, it is obvious the BSKSM takes it as the State should also protect and foster the Bikkhu Sasana, the Buddhist monks as well. What does this mean? The State is legally bound to grant whatever these monks want personal, in the way of employment in the government sector, luxury donations such as expensive comfortable cars, State recognition at State functions, diplomatic passports etc. and claim these as requirements to fostering Buddhism.
The State – the politicians readily grant these requests not to protect and foster Buddhism, but in return expect these monks to play active politics to come back to power.
This was amply demonstrated when some members of this same BSKSM distributed sil redi, conducted well-advertised Bodhi Poojas at the last Presidential and General Elections for a particular candidate and political party to come to power for personal favours granted.
Some have allowed their temple premises to be used as party offices, some organise Pindapatha to collect funds to pay a fine imposed by courts. That is the sad picture when the state takes the responsibility rather than allow the Buddhists, Buddhist organisations and genuine Buddhist monks to foster and propagate Buddhism and thereby gain merit.
In view of the above reasons not to politicise Buddhism it is best for, those who are drafting the New Constitution use the words Sri Lanka instead of the existing words ‘Republic of Sri Lanka’ and the word ‘State’ where it is not applicable. It is also advisable to include the setting up of an organisation to discipline those errant monks, in consultation with Maha Nayaka Theras and Heads of other Nikayas and keep them at temples to perform their legitimate religious functions. That is one way and an urgent need to save, protect and foster Buddhism.
Hope this will catch the eyes of those concerned in drafting the New Constitution and consider this as a submission to the Commission to save Buddhism from those unscrupulous monks who have a hidden agenda.
