Misuse of Rs. 3,000 m Divi Neguma Funds
Handunnetti wants govt explanation

JVP MP Sunil Handunnetti has asked the government to explain as to why the government has not taken action against the misuse of Rs. 3,000 million of the Divi Neguma Funds within seven days from November 2, 2014 to November 9, 2014 based on the presidential election.
The question of MP is pasted on the order paper scheduled to be taken up on November 3 in Parliament.
He has also questioned whether cases have been filed against those responsible and what is the progress of inquiry if cases have not filed.
Handunnetti further inquired about the actions to be taken by the minister in charge of the subject to prevent the recurrence of such misuses in the future since the profligacy of various funds of the government by the ministers in charge of subjects at their discretion without any cabinet approval could set a bad precedence. MP Handunnetti has also questioned about the measures taken by the government to expedite the judicial actions in respect of investigations regarding such financial crimes and if not he asked for the reasons.
The government is to respond to the query on next Tuesday.
