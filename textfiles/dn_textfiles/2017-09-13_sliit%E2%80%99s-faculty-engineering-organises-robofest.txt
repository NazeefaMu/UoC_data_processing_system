The Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Faculty of Engineering at SLIIT, organised another successful edition of its exciting annual robotic competition ‘ROBOFEST 2017’ recently.
Held for the 8th consecutive time, this year’s ROBOFEST was held from September 4-8, at the Main Auditorium of SLIIT, Malabe.
As in previous years the competition had three categories, school, undergraduate and open. Demonstrating an overwhelming response towards the competition, the event featured the participation of over 500 school students, 300 university students and 15 open participants.
“As a premier degree awarding institute we are elated that SLIIT has once again showcased its reputation of being in the forefront of organising this popular annual event. We witnessed brilliant young minds in action throughout ROBOFEST 2017 and are proud to inspire students with a competitive advantage who will lead tomorrow's workplaces,” said Professor Lalith Gamage, Vice Chancellor/CEO, SLIIT.
ROBOFEST provides an opportunity for school and university students to demonstrate their practical knowledge by designing a robot which has the ability to perform a given task. The teams whose robots perform the best are awarded cash prizes, valuable trophies and certificates. The ROBOFEST 2017, Gold winner of the school category was Kuliyapitiya Central College who received a trophy and cash prize of Rs 60,000. The Silver and Bronze awards were presented to two teams from Maliyadewa Adarsha Maha Vidyalaya who received valuable trophies and cash awards of Rs 35,000 and Rs 20,000 respectively.

The primary aim of the ROBOFEST competition is to enhance the talents of school and university students countrywide in robotic design, develop their teamwork abilities and interaction with participants, sharing knowledge and building strong bonds of friendship.
The competition also serves as an ideal platform to promote the application of problem solving skills and hone modules taught in undergraduate studies, such as Embedded Systems, Digital and Analog Electronics, Control Systems, Robotics and Software Engineering. Prior to the competition, workshops were held for school students at chosen locations countrywide helping them gain exposure in robotics and technology. The sponsors of ROBOFEST 2017 was Adelaide University Australia, Orel Corporation, DBG Company, scion electronics and SLT.
