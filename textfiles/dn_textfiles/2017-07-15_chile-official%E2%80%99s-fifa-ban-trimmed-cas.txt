Chile official’s FIFA ban trimmed by CAS

Lausanne, Friday: FIFA’s former World Cup evaluation chief Harold Mayne-Nicholls is free to return to football after his three-year ban was reduced to two years by the Court of Arbitration for Sport on Friday.
The Chilean was suspended from all football-related activities in July 2015 after being found guilty by FIFA’s ethics committee of “asking for personal favours”.
Mayne-Nicholls, a former Chilean football federation president, was in charge of evaluating the 2018 and 2022 World Cup bids. He wrote the report that gave Qatar the worst ranking of the candidates for the 2022 World Cup finals which the wealthy Gulf state went on to win.
Mayne-Nicholls notably asked for favours from Qatar for members of his family.
He was originally suspended for seven years but had his ban reduced to three years last April, with Friday’s CAS ruling meaning his suspension has now run its course. AFP
