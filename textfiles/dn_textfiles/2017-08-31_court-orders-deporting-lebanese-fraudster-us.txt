Court orders deporting of Lebanese fraudster to the US

The Colombo High Court yesterday ordered to deport a Lebanese national wanted by United States over several financial frauds he is alleged to have committed in the US. Colombo High Court Judge Vikum Kaluarachchi made this order pursuant to an application made by the Attorney General that the Lebanese national be deported to the US in accordance with the Extradition Law.
The US State Department had made a request from Sri Lankan authorities for extradition of Lebanese national Ahmed Fakhri, accused of committing several financial frauds in US.
The High Court Judge observed that the respondent Lebanese national is alleged to have committed extraditable offence and thereby he should be taken into custody in terms of Extradition Law.
It was reported that the Lebanese National had obstructed a photo journalist from carrying out his duties at the High Court premises when he was being taken into prison custody.
