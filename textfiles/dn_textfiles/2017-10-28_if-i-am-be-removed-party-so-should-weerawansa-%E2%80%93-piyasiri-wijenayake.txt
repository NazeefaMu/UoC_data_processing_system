If I am to be removed from party, so should Weerawansa – Piyasiri Wijenayake

National Freedom Front(NFF) National Organizer Piyasiri Wijenayake, who was criticized by fellow Party members for his criticism of Wimal Weerawansa over his statement on bombing the Parliament, said that if he was to be removed from his position or party, so should Wimal Weerawansa. A move, he said was seconded by the General Secretary of the Party.
“I don’t know if I was wrong to comment on what Wimal Weerawansa had said,” he told the Daily News. “I did not personally attack him or vilify him, but raised concerns over the salacious comments that Wimal had made, which I felt were detrimental.”
Wijenayake added if he was to be removed from his position or the party, then Wimal Weerawansa too should also be dealt with the same card. “I spoke to General Secretary Jayantha Samaraweera, who said that he had received a suggestion that I should be removed, but he had refused to sign it or address it with the media, adding that if I was to be dealt with in this manner, so should Wimal Weerawansa.”
Wijenayake maintained that his statements were not a matter which ought to have been discussed with the Party head or its members before pronouncing them. He added that if it was so, Wimal Weerawansa too should have done the same.
