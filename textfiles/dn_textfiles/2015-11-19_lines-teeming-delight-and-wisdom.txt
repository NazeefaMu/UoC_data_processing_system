Lines teeming with delight and wisdom

He came all the way from the village of Tawalantanna in Kotmale with his father mother and the sister. We knew him only as a poet but seeing him physically we found him seated in an electronic wheelchair smiling and charming. He was in Colombo to see how his contemporaries discuss his collection of poems titled ‘Viramayakata Pasuva Hamuvemu’ (Santhava publishers 2015) at the Friday communication discourse of Sri Lanka Press Council in Colombo.
The young poet is Gayan Indula Kodituvakku. He has presented 36 Sinhala poems. Some poems had appeared on facebook and a number of poetry pages of Sinhala periodicals.
“All I want is to listen. Just go ahead with what you have got to say about my poetry,” he said encouragingly and smilingly.
On reading, I came across a number of good poems worthy of discussion. One, a very brief one, enveloped a sparkling theme as addressed to a flame of fire lighted in a dark room.
“I want to ward off the wind entering,
into the abode allowing you to brighten the room, but may you see that you don’t create a flaming big fire that burns the eyes of the teeny weeny moths.”
Though Kodituvakku had only primary education, he had been diligent to have been a self-made scholar by reading a great deal of books. In his poems you will feel the classical charm of a Sinhala poem. Sometimes he attempts to blend the more spoken Sinhala words with those of the classical works. This could be discerned as a poetic identity of Kodituvakku. This too enables him perhaps to express his poetic experiences more intimately.
In ‘Ayale Giya Vasat Irtuva’ (The Season of Spring Gone Astray), for instance, he creates a poetic persona. That persona narrates in a tone of sensitive lamentation that a certain image which was a driving force during the season had disappeared with the dawn of a new season.
This is how it goes:
“I fail to see the pretty locks of hair of yours I saw once through the shady groves with fallen leaves now. But I feel that the emerged new season had darkened that image, of mine. But I try to uncover failingly to have a glimpse of that image Again and again I try my best to clean the rusty surface of the mirror held in my hand The more and more I do I see that the seasonal times had been a vagrant.”
It is accepted that poetry is untranslatable. One misses a certain degree of essence in the original in translation. I find the same about these poems as well. But may it be said in good honour of the poet that the quality of spiritual experiences and the need for a better living condition that he endeavours to embrace is very much alive in his poetry.
In a brilliant piece titled as Indrajalika Pedesaka (In a Magical Area). The poetic persona is more of a fantasy builder. He imagines of a wonderland of magic free from sorrows and agonies.
Then follows a necessity to stick in it. To get rid of that condition, he should immerse his mind and body in that wonderland of magic feeling aloof from the present climate of dismay.
The journey should not be one traversed so far by any other for it may mean a beaten track. As such it should be his own free will utilised as an experienced person journeying all by himself. The purpose is to see that there is a need to immerse the mind and the body in order to be alleviated from the agonies of the present moment.
I felt as if I am enjoying a creative exercise on existentialism, the wisdom on the being and nothingness as visualised by thinkers like Sartre. This poetic creation also visualises the broadening of the borders of poetic expression via new knowledge form and expression.
He too visualises some of the socio political nuances in a different manner with his identity. This, up to some degree, is observed in the poem titled Aragalaya (The Struggle):
“The struggle is over now and we smile as a group and singles Red flowers too were sold Time passed by We were perhaps looked down as tramps by some those days Some of us were killed by rivals The swords too were used and some of us lost all our limbs bodily There were barbed wire fences that encircled our dreams
Then came a time when alms too were given to obtain merits.”
This kind of poetry deserves much encouragement.
