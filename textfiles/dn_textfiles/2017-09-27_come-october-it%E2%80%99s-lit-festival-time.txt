Come October, it’s lit festival time

Everything will be literature on October 7 (Saturday). A and K is the name, abbreviation of Annasi and Kadalagotu, and the stage would be set at the historically renowned Mount Lavinia Hotel. The screen will rise at 9 am and the show will go on till sundown when the final curtain will close the event with instant open-mike poetry accompanied by ‘koththu roti’ and chilled beer, made available at nominal prices.
Tickets are 100 rupees per head for the whole day and all the events, a feast of tri-lingual literature in varying formats dished out by the well-known and the ‘yet to be known’ local literati.
The venue is undoubtedly flamboyant and filled with grandeur; the ticket price is very reasonable at one hundred rupees, to make it affordable to everyone. The catch phrase of A and K remains the same highlighting it’s meaning to one and all, ‘Simply literature, simply local.’
There will be events catering to one and all. Panel discussions will be held covering interesting subjects, the panelists being hand-picked for their varying experiences of literature, and they will be facilitated by competent moderators. There will also be “one-to-one” interviews with authors discussing their books and all these events will have audience participation with Q and A sessions. Many more surprising stage performances are in the menu card which will make the spectator strut from venue to venue crossing the magnificent Mount Lavinia Hotel corridors to enjoy the varying flavours of the event.
I make no picks to highlight who’s on stage as there are so many to mention. Best is for you to find your way to the sea-side resort and make your choices from the list of events.
As for the content on the programme, it sure is a buffet dishing out palatable literature in Sinhala, Tamil and English to satiate the varying taste buds of all literature lovers.
That is it friends, make a note, make a date and be at the Mount Lavinia Hotel on October 7. It is all about browsing books, listening to experts and having an enjoyable day; after all, it is simply literature, simply local.
