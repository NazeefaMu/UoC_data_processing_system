Fonseka appointment a blow to democracy: JVP

The proposal to set up a special force under Field Marshall Sarath Fonseka is an attempt to quell public protests and promote military rule, JVP MP Vijitha Herath said.
The MP was speaking at the adjournment debate in Parliament today. 
He questioned how President Maithripala Sirisena, who came to power on the pledge of abolishing the Executive Presidency and reviving democracy, could come up with such an idea.
“The Government is going to set up a special force to suppress public protests and thereby to subvert the true issues of the people. When the people are lining up against the move to sell the country’s assets, the Government is trying to control the public protests. The Government is trying to cover up its inability by suppression. This is a dangerous situation. The President and the Cabinet should take the responsibility of this move. People are not ready to go back to a military rule. They do not want another Gotabhaya Rajapaksa” he noted.
“The fall of this Government would not be far, if the Government continues to suppress the people’s democratic rights,” he added.
