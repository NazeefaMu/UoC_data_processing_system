SL listed Human Rights ‘Priority Country’ for second time

Sri Lanka for the second year, has been listed as a Human Rights Priority Country HRPC, by the Foreign and Commonwealth Office of the United Kingdom. In a report commissioned for the British Parliament, titled, “Human Rights and Democracy,” Sri Lanka has been commended for the progress it had made on human rights thus far, but still, the report concludes that
“much remained to be done.”
In the report, an HRPC is qualified by the present human rights situation in the country; the country’s human rights trajectory and UK’s ability to influence changes. In reference to Sri Lanka, the reports first reference was the way Sri Lanka has made progress against some of its commitments toward human rights. It applauded Sri Lanka for the establishment of its Office of Missing Persons.
“This was an important step towards reconciliation, although it is yet to come into operation,” the report stated.
The report also lauded the current Constitutional reforms process underway. The report says, “It is hoped that this will address issues of devolution and introduce a Bill of Rights.” It also commended the Sri Lankan Government for committing itself to repeal “the much criticised Prevention of Terrorism Act (PTA).” Yet, although it applauded the country’s efforts regarding Constitutional reforms, reconciliation and the establishment of the OMP, the report also criticized Sri Lanka too. The report singled out Sri Lanka for discrimination against LGBTQ people, specifically the transgender community, adding that inter communal tensions remained a point of concern.
“Tensions were fuelled by hate speech by members of extremist nationalist groups,” the report stated.
The report also claimed that while the government participated in UN’s visits to the country, there was concern about the “standard of detention centres and continued cases of torture.”
In addition to Sri Lanka, the other countries listed as HRPCs are: Afghanistan, Bahrain, People’s Republic of Bangladesh, Burma, Burundi, Central African Republic (CAR), China, Colombia, Democratic People’s Republic of Korea (North Korea), Democratic Republic of the Congo, Egypt, Eritrea, Iran, Iraq, the State of Israel and the Occupied Palestinian Territories (OPTs), Libya, Republic of Maldives, Pakistan, Russia, Saudi Arabia, Somalia, South Sudan, Sudan, Syria, Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan, Venezuela, Yemen, and Zimbabwe.
