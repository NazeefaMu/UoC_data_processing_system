‘Dengue vaccine in phase two of trial stage here’

A dengue vaccine is currently in phase two of the trial stage in 10 countries,including Sri Lanka, Health Services Acting Director General Dr.J. M.W.Jayasundara Bandara said.
Addressing a press conference at the Health Promotion Bureau in Colombo yesterday, he said that data is being collected for the trial at four centres in Sri Lanka at present.
“The prevalence of Dengue in Sri Lanka has been reduced by 90 percent in five weeks after the recent epidemic, because of the support provided by the media and the people,” he said.
Dr.Bandara pointed out that Sri Lanka is well ahead of many developed countries and neighbouring India when it comes to controlling HIV, eliminating Malaria etc, but unfortunately Sri Lanka still lags behind other countries when it comes to alcohol use and suicide rate.
Dr.Bandara pointed out the importance of introducing and promoting ‘Community Medicine’ in the private sector, especially in private hospitals.
“It should be promoted in certain other sectors such as in Armed Forces etc,” he said.
