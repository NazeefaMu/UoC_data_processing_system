Wildlife Department warns against setting fire to forests

The Wildlife Department has warned those who purposely set fire to government forest reserves, forests, jungles and thickets these days will be arrested and produced before Courts as both human beings and wild animals have severely become helpless due to the existing dry weather patterns in the country.
These days, fires would spread fast due to the environment being dry. Setting fire to forests and forest reserves would destroy wild animals as their habitats too would be ruined.
The nearest Forest Officer or Police station should be informed of such moves, as it is a national responsibility. About 150 wildlife assistants have been deployed countrywide to be on the alert to setting fire to forests purposely, said W. E. Jayathilake, Kurunegala District Divisional Secretary speaking to the Daily News.
