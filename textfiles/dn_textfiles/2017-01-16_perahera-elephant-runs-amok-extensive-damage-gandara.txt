Perahera elephant runs amok, extensive damage in Gandara

The elephant carrying the casket containing the sacred relics at the 72nd Duruthu Perahera of the Wijerathnaramaya Viharaya in Gandara on Poya day ran amok and caused extensive damage to private and public property.
The elephant was tranquilised after about five hours by wildlife officials.
The incident is said to have occurred when the casket bearing the sacred relics got entangled with an overhead telecommunication wire opposite the Gandara Fisheries Harbour at around 6.30 p.m.
The elephant smashed up a three wheeler, toppled five or six electricity and telephone posts, parapet walls, coconut palms and was said to even have flung bundles of fishing nets before it was sedated by a team of wildlife officials led by Dr. Nandana Perera.
Dr. Perera is attached to the Ridiyagama Safari Park. The area was in total darkness after the electricity posts were damaged.
No injuries were reporteded. The casket carrying the sacred relics was damaged. The elephant brought from Maharagama was transported back around 11.30 p.m. 
Damaged parapet walls
