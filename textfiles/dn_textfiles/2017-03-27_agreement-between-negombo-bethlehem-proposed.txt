Agreement between Negombo, Bethlehem proposed

A proposal was made to sign a twinning agreement between the cities of Negombo and Bethlehem recently.
Sri Lanka Representative in Palestine M. Fawzan Anverr had a meeting with Fr. Rami Asakrieh OFM (Order of Minor Friars) of the Nativity Church of Bethlehem and proposed to sign a twinning agreement between Negombo and Bethlehem.
The proposal is supported by Tourism Development and Christian Religious Affairs Minister John Amaratunga. Fr. Rami Asakrieh expressed his happiness to start the procedures to sign the agreement and send a request letter to Archbishop of Colombo Malcolm Cardinal Ranjith noting that this will be the first agreement to be signed between the two cities.
Fr. Rami Asakrieh handed over the letter to Fawzan Anver and praised the historical, long standing support of Sri Lanka to Palestine.
