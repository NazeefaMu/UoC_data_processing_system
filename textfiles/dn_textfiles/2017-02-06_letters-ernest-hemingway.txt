The letters of Ernest Hemingway

The publication of Ernest Hemingway’s complete correspondence is shaping up to be an astonishing scholarly achievement. We are already on the third of a projected seventeen volumes, minimum, which will include in their entirety every surviving letter, postcard and telegram sent by Hemingway. Meticulously edited, with shrewd introductory summaries and footnotes tracking down every reference, the series brings into sharp focus this contradictory, alternately smart and stupid, blustering, fragile man who was also a giant of modern literature.
The third volume, ably edited by Rena Sanderson, Sandra Spanier and Robert W. Trogdon, takes us through a particularly eventful and productive patch of Hemingway’s life, from 1926 to 1929. At the beginning he is just tackling the rewrites of The Sun Also Rises (1926) and seeing through publication his satiric novel The Torrents of Spring (1926) – his first, chronologically speaking, though it is seldom credited as such. He will switch publishers to land with the prestigious editor Maxwell Perkins at Scribner’s, will write some of his greatest short stories for the collection Men Without Women (1927), and go on to compose his second proper novel, the hugely successful A Farewell to Arms (1929). Having entered the four-year period aged twenty-seven as a promising if uncommercial newcomer backed by obscure experimental presses, he will exit it at thirty transformed into a literary lion and international celebrity. In the process he will leave his first wife Hadley, on whose slender trust fund he has been subsisting, for his second wife Pauline Pfeiffer, a much more wealthy heiress; he will abandon bohemian Paris and return to the United States, indulging a newfound passion for big game fishing; his father will have committed suicide and he himself will assume the role of paterfamilias and the responsibility of extended family provider.
Painfully reserved
Throughout these years, Hemingway will dash off letters to some ninety-nine recipients, varying the tone with each: to Maxwell Perkins, for instance, he is respectful, keeping up the salutation “Dear Mr. Perkins” until well into their collaboration; to F. Scott Fitzgerald he is jokey but also longing for the other man’s companionship; to his mother Grace, he is painfully reserved and hostile. He is most unbuttoned with chums and acolytes, who pose no threat. Ezra Pound brings out the nasty, name-calling side of Hemingway: anti-Semitic and homophobic terms like “kikes” and “fairies” abound (one is reluctant simply to blame the times), as well as vicious put-downs of his contemporaries. He is often threatening to sock someone on the nose. Letter-writing seems to have offered him a chance to be casual, rash and wilfully unfair.
Considering what a conscientious stylist Hemingway was in his serious prose, he brought little precision or care to his correspondence. Nor did he use letters as an opportunity for introspection or self-examination. Indeed, he confessed to having a hard time putting his private life into them. He apologized for being an irregular, undependable correspondent, begging off with the excuse that he needed to save the verbal energy for his books. He loved to receive mail and be connected to the literary world’s gossip, but one senses his own responses were the reluctant obligatory dues paid to stay in that sphere. An irony of this monumental project is that Hemingway was not one of literature’s great letter writers; his efforts are nevertheless steadfastly interesting to read, partly because he could never write poorly, and partly because they offer many insights into his character and milieu.
While Hemingway frequently expressed dissatisfaction with his writing, his comments about the actual problems involved in composing were sparse, in keeping with his conviction that “It’s a terrible mistake to talk about a book”. He would state the number of pages he’d written but little about their substance. As someone who never attended college, he was always playing catch-up, reading omnivorously, with an eye towards finding models for the rhetorically chaste style he tried to perfect. He had little patience for Whitman or Stendhal or Henry James. About James, his opposite, he wrote: “My impression is that he knew NOTHING about people . . . . He seems to need to bring in a drawing room whenever he is scared he will have to think what the characters do the rest of the time and the men all without exception talk and think like fairies except a couple of caricatures of brutal ‘outsiders’”. In the original draft of The Sun Also Rises he ridiculed James as impotent from a rumoured bicycling accident, but Maxwell Perkins made him change it.
Satirical takedown
Overall, Hemingway’s relationship to other writers, living or dead, was comparative and pugilistic: “Writing whether you want it or not is competitive”, he wrote to Perkins in Sept­ember 1928. This outlook led him to demean many of his contemporaries, even – perhaps especially – those who had helped him on the way up. One famous example was his satirical takedown of Sherwood Anderson in The Torrents of Spring. Anderson had been one of his staunchest supporters, and Hemingway had learned a lot from the older writer. As he wrote to Owen Wister in March 1929: “He wrote some stories that I thought were lovely – all the time he was working as an advertising writer but he wrote simply and to me, anyway, very beautifully – about people and the country and, it’s true, best of all about adolescence – he went to New York and a number of Jews – Stieglitz, W. Frank, Paul Rosenfeld got hold of him and turned his head with praise”. Leave it to the Jews and New York to corrupt a pure adman’s soul. Hemingway thought Anderson’s 1925 novel Dark Laughter was mediocre, so he took it into his head to dash off a parody in a week. It may not have been accidental that he was also trying to get out of his contract with Horace Liveright, who published his first story collection, In Our Time (1925), and who had an option on his next book, in order to switch to Maxwell Perkins at Scribner’s. As Anderson was one of Liveright’s star authors, the publisher would be expected to reject Hemingway’s manuscript on that ground alone, even if he hadn’t hated it.
Self-justifying letter
Almost nobody liked it, including Hemingway’s wife Hadley and his friend John Dos Passos, but Perkins agreed to publish it in order to sign up The Sun Also Rises and all his subsequent books. “About the Torrents – I never could figure out what happened to it – I was very fond of it – but nobody else seemed to like it . . .”, Hemingway wrote to an admirer, perplexedly.
He sent Anderson a self-justifying letter when it came out. “You see I feel that if among ourselves we have to pull our punches, if when a man like yourself who can write very great things writes something that seems to me (who have never written anything great but am anyway a fellow craftsman) rotten, I ought to tell you so . . . . Outside of personal feelings nothing that’s any good can be hurt by satire.” When they next met, the two men had a few drinks and Hemingway came away feeling that everything was “swell” between them. Quite the contrary. As we learn from Lesley M. M. Blume’s excellent book, Everybody Behaves Badly: The true story behind Hemingway’s masterpiece “The Sun Also Rises”, Anderson remained hurt for the rest of his life. He found Hemingway’s missive “probably the most completely patronizing letter ever written . . . . It was a kind of funeral oration delivered over my grave”.
It is instructive to read Everybody Behaves Badly in tandem with Volume 3 of Hemingway’s letters, which it precedes and overlaps with chronologically. Moreover, it fills in many gaps by reporting the reactions of those who suffered collateral damage from Hemingway’s exuberantly belligerent behaviour. “He unabashedly took what he needed and usually moved quickly on – repaying most of his patrons for their generosity in unexpected ways, to put it mildly”, Blume writes. Without sounding unduly disapproving or moralistic, Blume gives us a portrait of the artist as a young opportunist. We see him befriending, exploiting and ultimately turning on everyone who had ben­efited him: Anderson, Liveright, Fitzgerald, Gertrude Stein, Robert McAlmon, Ford Madox Ford, Gerald and Sarah Murphy, Dorothy Parker, Donald Ogden Stewart. Blume also furnishes sketches of the original group who would be pressed into service as the thinly disguised cast of characters in The Sun Also Rises, starting with Harold Loeb (the unfortunate model for Robert Cohn). “Hemingway had a little bit of poison for everyone during this time, and he was becoming quite adept at co-opting the lives and vulnerabilities of others as grist for his literary mill.”
Blume maintains this calm, witty tone, though when she comes to the break-up with Hadley, you can sense her itching to pounce: “Hemingway became irate when Hadley confronted him back in Paris.
Yes, he was having an affair, he admitted, but then he turned the tables on Hadley: she was the one doing irreparable damage to the marriage by bringing it up. Everything would have been just fine if she hadn’t dragged it into the open – or at least, that was Hadley’s interpretation of his position”. Meanwhile, he was hiding the news of his divorce from his parents, and when he finally came clean to his father, he insisted that he had never been unfaithful to Hadley. He also let it be known to everyone that he was nobly letting all the royalties for The Sun Also Rises go to Hadley and their son left behind. Years later, in A Moveable Feast (1964), he would blame the rich expatriate crowd, the Murphys et al., for persuading him to leave Hadley and go with the more fashionable Pauline. (By that time he had left Pauline as well and was nostalgic for the Hadley years.)
The few letters to Hadley and Pauline that survive from this period are suffused with an expressive torment and self-pity uncharacteristic of Hemingway. In love with both women and not knowing how to resolve the problem, he felt he was going to pieces and considered killing himself. - Times Literary Supplement
