‘Independence,’ no path to Opp. Leader post

Ports and Shipping Minister Mahinda Samarasinghe yesterday categorically stated that the Joint Opposition (JO) cannot acquire the Opposition Leader’s Post by becoming independent in Parliament. He was responding to a question by a journalist regarding the Joint Opposition’s decision to become independent in Parliament at a media conference held at the SLFP Headquarters.
The Minister said that the Speaker has clearly noted that only six political parties are recognised in Parliament. So he has not accepted any independent group. Though the JO claims that they will act independently in Parliament, the reason for this decision is not clear, he noted.
“Anybody can act independently in Parliament whenever they wish by making a statement.
Even I can. But soon after the announcement, my party can remove me from the party and also take a decision on the MP Post and a new member can be appointed instead,” said the Minister.
As the leaders of the SLFP we are always attempting to bring JO members back to the SLFP in order to strengthen the party and not to remove them from the party.
The Minister said that around 80 percent of the restructuring and reforms process has been completed and they hoped to complete the process before the anniversary celebrations.
