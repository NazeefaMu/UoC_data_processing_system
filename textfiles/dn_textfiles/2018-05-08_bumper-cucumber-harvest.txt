Bumper cucumber harvest

Eastern Province cultivators have reaped a bumper yield of cucumber, popular now because of the warm weather prevailing in the Province.
Cucumber grown in home gardens earns an extra income for householders.
The investment is little with good profit. Cultivators of cucumber in Kirankulam in the Batticaloa district and Thiraikeny in the Addalaichenai DS division obtained a bumper yield this season.
At present a kilo of cucumber is sold at Rs.150 upwards.
