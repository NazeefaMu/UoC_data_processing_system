Chrissy Teigen Shows Off Baby Bump In Cute Crop Top

Chrissy Teigen kept it casual while running errands in Los Angeles on Sunday.
The 29-year-old model and TV personality wore a cute gray crop top showing off her tiny baby bump and paired it with black leggings and black Nike trainers. Teigen announced that she was expecting a child with husband John Legend in early October.
Teigen recently had to defend her baby bump after Instagramming a picture of herself and her growing stomach. Commenters began speculating that Teigen was pregnant with twins and the model fought back against the comments on Twitter.
"I did IVF. One at a time. It isn't twins. I can see the damn thing. Get out of my uterus! - christine teigen (@chrissyteigen) October 18, 2015"
But it doesn't look like a little Internet controversy will stop Teigen from having more babies. The model told HuffPost Live in May 2014 that she wanted a big family, resembling an "Angelina-Brad-type brood."
"We want a lot of kids," said Teigen. "I would love to have three or four of my own, and then adopt a few. So basically I'll be pregnant the rest of my life."
