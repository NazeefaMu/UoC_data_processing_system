Drought – resistant Soya to be promoted in A’pura

The government will expand Soya bean cultivation in the country with priority given to the Anuradhapura district on the instructions of President Maithripala Sirisena.
The official in charge of Soya crop at the Agriculture Department and Assistant Director Buddhika Abesinghe told the Daily News that among other crops Soya was the one which could survive and thrive during severe drought.
According to him, Soya required comparably less fertilizer, less water and less care.
“Soya cultivation in the Yala season has been a success despite the drought. Also in the 2016/2017 Maha Season, farmers in the Mahaweli H Zone were able to produce 300,000 kilograms of Soya, adequate to fulfill the Soya seed requirement for the next seasons.
“Although we planned to cultivate Soya in 25,000 hectares in the country during the Yala season, the lack of rain confined it only to 4,300 hectares in the Mahaweli H Zone, Huruluwewa in the Anuradhapura district and to 2,200 hectares in the Ampara, Kurunegala, Polonnaruwa, Moneragala and Vavuniya districts, Abesinghe said.
He added that from the 2017 Yala season cultivation, a harvest of 12,500 MT is expected, which is sufficient to cover the local consumption. He said by 2020, the national Soya requirement could be produced in the country.
