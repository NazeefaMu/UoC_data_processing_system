Handicapped civilians receive artificial limbs

Sixteen artificial limbs for physically-handicapped civilians of low-income groups in Iyakachchi, Jaffna were distributed at the 12 (V) Vijayabahu Infantry Regiment Headquarters under the 55 Division of the Security Force Headquarters - Jaffna (SFHQ-J) recently.
The Kundasale Centre for Handicapped funded the cost of the limbs at the request of the SFHQ-J. The sponsors visited the area and picked up handicapped civilians for measurements. The limbs were distributed in the presence of donors and 552 Brigade Commander Colonel Dinesh Nanayakkara as the Chief Guest.
