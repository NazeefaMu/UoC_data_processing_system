Prices of 23 drugs drop

Health Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne said the government reduced the prices 23 pharmaceutical drugs including 10 expensive cancer drugs and some medical equipment, with effect from midnight on Saturday.
The gazette notification bringing the price reduction into effect was issued on midnight Friday, Minister Dr. Senaratne said, at the opening of the 39th Osu Sala of the State Pharmaceutical Corporation at the Peradeniya University premises on Saturday.
Accordingly, the tender prices of 10 expensive cancer drugs have been brought under control and the maximum retail prices of 13 selected drugs have been regulated. In addition, the maximum retail price of the blood glucose meter has also been regulated. The minister went onto say that the government spends around Rs. 4 billion annually for cancer drugs. However, the government has been able to save around Rs.2 billion by controlling tender prices.
While noting that some cancer drugs were very expensive, the minister said 95 per cent of cancer drug imports were undertaken by the government.
“Most cancer patients and their families don’t have the means to buy such expensive cancer drugs,” he said.
The minister also said that the price of insulin used to treat diabetic patients has been brought down to Rs.1,200 from Rs. 1,760.
“The blood glucose meter which was Rs. 5,260 is reduced to Rs. 2,750 and blood glucose test strips have been brought down from Rs. 90 to Rs. 60,” he said.
The minister said the 13 selected drugs subjected to price reduction include antibiotics, drugs for neurological diseases, asthma, and epilepsy, drugs for diabetes including insulin, and drugs to control cholesterol.
The minister said the government spends around Rs. 7 billion annually for drug imports.
He recalled that the present government in October 2016 took steps to regulate the prices of 48 essential pharmaceutical drugs and as a result the prices of about 400 drugs sold under various brand names were reduced significantly.
With the latest effort, the minister said prices of 74 pharmaceutical drugs have been regulated and this means the prices of around 1,000 drugs sold under various brand names have come down.
