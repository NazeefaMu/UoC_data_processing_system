Isipathana stands firm  and says no date changes: SLSRFA postpones rugby final to July 16 at Racecoursea

 
The Sri Lanka Schools Rugby Football Association (SLSRFA) has taken a shocking decision to postpone the Milo inter-schools President’s trophy knockout rugby final to July 16 and the venue will be Racecourse international stadium at Reid Avenue.
The SLSRFA’s latest decision to the ongoing crisis of staging the all-important final is another series of never ending changes which exposes them as an unprofessional unit unable to make a straight forward decision.
Denzil Darling the SLSRFA secretary told the ‘Daily News: “After meeting today with both the school officials we are glad to inform that we have come to a final decision with the approval of both schools to stage the final on July 16 at Racecourse grounds.”
However Rajive Rodrigo, the Isipathana OBA vice-president totally contradicted Darling’s statement.
“It’s not true that our Principal or anyone from our rugby committee agreed with Denzil Darling or anyone from SLSRFA for a date change for the final. We only wanted a venue change so that the final will be played on a neutral ground,” said Rodrigo.
“We have not and we will not agree to play the final on any other day other than original date of July 9 as most of our players will not be available as they will be participating in the Hong Kong Under 18 rugby tournament. They will be deprived of representing Isipathana in the final if it is played on July 16,” he said.
