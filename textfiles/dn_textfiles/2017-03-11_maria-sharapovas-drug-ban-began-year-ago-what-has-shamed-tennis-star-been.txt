Maria Sharapova's drug ban began an year ago  : What has the shamed tennis  star been up to?

It was a year ago that Maria Sharapova hired a conference room in a Los Angeles hotel and publicly pre-empted the announcement that she had failed a test for the newly banned drug meldonium during the 2016 Australian Open.
The countdown is now on to her comeback and she is not wasting any time. Despite her 15-month ban not ending until April 26, the Wednesday of the Porsche Grand Prix in Stuttgart, the promoters are arranging the schedule to accommodate her in the draw (although she is not allowed on site until that day).
When faced with a ban for doping, most athletes decide to fade into the background. However, with her own brand to protect and a host of others to promote, the former world No 1 has been no shrinking violet.
Some of the great and good in tennis and the corporate world have chosen to overlook the reason she has been absent. One can only wonder whether, say, a leading track-and-field athlete or cyclist would have been so accommodated under the same circumstances. In between training stints and regular commercial appearances, here are some of the highlights of the past year for tennis' highest profile doping offender yet÷
The early weeks of Maria's suspension are spent rehabbing existing injuries, but by the end of April she is back on the court and practising÷
May 2 Ò Looking stunning in a dress provided for her by designer Juan Carlos Obando, she attends the high society Met Gala in New York, which raises funds for the Metropolitan Museum. Lewis Hamilton is on hand for a joint selfie. May 24 Ò After a visit to Paris Maria has a new line of chocolates to launch as part of her Sugarpova candy line, and attends the Sweets and Snacks Expo in Chicago.
She is photographed in a Zara shirt emblazoned with the phrase 'Back in Five Minutes', which becomes a worldwide seller as they are snapped up by fans around the globe.

The month ends with promotion for another commercial partner, skincare brand Supergoop.
October 4 Ò The Court of Arbitration for Sport gives the result of the appeal hearing against her ITF suspension. As is usually the case with CAS in tennis cases, it looks favourably upon the player and the ban is reduced from two years to fifteen months. Sharapova refers to it as the 'striking down' of the ITF decision. More neutral observers point out that the ban remains, albeit shortened. A frantic round of sympathetic interviews and chat show appearances ensues.
October 10 Ò It's High Fives all round with the likes of John McEnroe and Martina Navratilova as Maria returns to the court for the World Team Tennis Smash Hits event in Las Vegas. There is a selfie with Sir Elton John, who is behind the event with Billie Jean King.
