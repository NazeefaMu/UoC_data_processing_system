Annual contracts to undergo changes

The Sri Lanka cricketers who are due to tour England starting next month will be bound by only a tour contract as their annual contracts are not yet ready.
Sri Lanka Cricket secretary Mohan de Silva said that the long term contracts cannot be given yet because they are planning to change the system.
“We are in the process of working out a formula that will be more on a performance based system,” said De Silva.
“We will give them a reasonable annual retainer then thereafter it will be on the basis of their performance,” he said.
The annual player contracts expired at the end of February but was extended till the end of April to accommodate the Asia Cup and World T20 tournaments.
De Silva said that a 25-member squad has been picked for training ahead of the England tour.
“The squad will start training from Monday after the return of head coach Graham Ford who has gone home on a vacation,” said De Silva.
The 25-member squad picked before the Sinhala and Tamil New Year has yet to be released to the media.
