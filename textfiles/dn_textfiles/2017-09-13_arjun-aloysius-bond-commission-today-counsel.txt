Arjun Aloysius before bond commission today - counsel

President’s Counsel Anuja Premaratne yesterday confirmed that his client Arjun Aloysius will arrive at the Treasury Bond Commission today (13) as summoned.
Premaratne PC also informed the tribunal that CID officers attached to the Treasury Bond Commission have visited Aloysius’s house demanding him to come to the commission along with certain bank statements required by the commission.
Acting Solicitor General de Livera said Aloysius was required to provide the commission with bank statements regarding all his bank account by Tuesday. Aloysius however has failed to provide these documents.
Explaining the delay, Premaratne PC said they would provide the commission with the requested bank statements as soon as the two banks which Aloysius transacts with will supply the specific documents. “My client was held at the commission until around 2.40 p.m. yesterday. By that time the banks were almost closed. We will submit the required bank statements by tomorrow.” Premaratne PC assured.
Meanwhile, Deputy Solicitor General Milinda Gunatilake informed the commission that W.M. Mendis & Company has not provided the commission with certain documents requested.
Premaratne PC informed the commission that the said documents will be handed over to the commission on Wednesday as well.
He also informed the commission that the telephone call recordings extracted from Aloysius’ mobile phone has not yet been given to him for perusal. He requested for the said data at least 24 hours before cross examining his client. Acting Solicitor General de Livera said he will inquire from Additional Solicitor General Yasantha Kodagoda if the extraction is over and let Premaratne PC know.
