Former Defence Ministry Monitoring MP Sajin Vass Gunawardena who pleaded guilty in a corruption case filed against him by Bribery Commission was ordered to pay a fine of Rs.1000 by the Colombo Chief Magistrate today. This is the third time in Sri Lanka a politician was convicted by a Court over an offence that comes under the Declaration of Assets and Liabilities Law. The Commission to Investigate Allegations of Bribery or Corruption filed a corruption case in Colombo Chief Magistrate’s Court against former parliamentarian Sajin Vass Gunawardena over the non-declaration of assets and liabilities while he was serving as a Parliamentarian between March 31, 2011 and March 31, 2012.  According to Assets and Liabilities Law, the Court has jurisdiction to impose a fine of Rs.1000 or one year jail term for a person who found guilty to the charges.
Colombo Additional Magistrate Aruni Artigala imposed a fine of Rs.1000 regarding the case and observed that the accused will have to serve one-month-jail term in default of payment of the fine.
