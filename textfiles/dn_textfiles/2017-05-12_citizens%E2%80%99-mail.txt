Citizens’ Mail

Fence the strikes
General Trade Union actions are a violation of the people's right of rule by an elected government.
A trade union should not have the right to strike on any demands other than matters that directly concern their vocation. The decision to strike itself should be made only after a secret ballot among the members and after a ruling by an independent Tribunal. The cause is genuinely related to a grievance of the particular Union members.
Such a clause should be included in the new constitution even if a public referendum is required. That will ensure public convenience at least to some extent. That will also keep business-minded people from manipulating the sacred professions such as the medical field.
