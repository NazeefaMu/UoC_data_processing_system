NFF leaves Constitutional Assembly

Five Parliamentarians of the National Freedom Front (NFF) yesterday, informed the Speaker in writing that they will be leaving the Constitutional Assembly.
The five NFF parliamentarians who were elected to Parliament after contesting under the United People’s Freedom Alliance (UPFA) yesterday, handed over their letter to Speaker Karu Jayasuriya informing that they will be leaving the Constitutional Assembly.
The parliamentarians leaving are NFF Leader MP Wimal Weearawansa and Weerakumara Dissanayake, Jayantha Samaraweera, Udayashantha Gunasekara and Niroshan Premaratne.
In their letter, the MPs have mentioned ten reasons as to why they decided to leave the Constitutional Assembly and they have also mentioned that all representatives of the party unanimously agreed with this decision.
They urged the Speaker to inform Parliament that their departure would challenge the validity of the Constitutional Assembly, since it has breached one condition of the proposal passed in Parliament that the Constitutional Assembly should consist of all the 225 Parliamentarians.
In their letter, NFF MPs have mentioned that the NFF accept the joint statement made by the Bhikkus of three Nikayas claiming that there was no need to bring in a new Constitution. They also informed that the people’s mandate has not been received by the 95 joint opposition members to bring amendments to the Constitution and Parliament has no special majority to do so.
