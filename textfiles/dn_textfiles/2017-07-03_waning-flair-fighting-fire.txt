Waning flair for fighting fire

With Colombo and its suburbs evolving into a burst of high-rise buildings, with many presently under construction and many more on the line, no adequate attention is given to safety measures in the event of a major fire.
United Kingdom's Sri Lanka branch of the Institute of Fire Engineers Secretary Nalaka Liyanapeli said, Sri Lanka’s fire safety measures cover only five percent of the international fire safety standards.
He highlighted the need to ensure safety of the occupants of the buildings during a crisis or calamity.
According to the statistics from the Colombo Municipal Council (CMC), the country has fewer than 40 fire stations. Meanwhile, the vehicles and equipment currently being used are more than 15 years old.
According to the Sri Lanka Fire Service Department Acting Divisional Officer of Operations K.D Wijesooriya, these vehicleS need to be replaced every five years, but it has not been happening as only a little attention is given to the Fire Service Department.
More than half of all civilian fire stations are in the Western Province. The Southern and Central Provinces, each, has three stations, according to the CMC. The fire stations in other areas function either under municipal councils or 'pradeshiya sabhas'. The Sri Lanka Air Force (SLAF) has units at all of its air bases and they immediately respond, particularly when there is a fire in the vicinity of a base. However, only a few fire stations have professional fire fighters and necessary equipment to fight in the event of a major fire.
Fire prevention measures—not up to the standard
The Construction industry Development Authority (CIDA) is the body tasked with devising fire safety regulations for buildings. These regulations, however, have not been devised since 2004. Even though fire safety measures is a necessary requirement with the increase in high-rise buildings coming up in many parts of the country, the committee appointed to bring revision is yet to introduce the regulations.
Chief Fire Officer P.N.R Fernando, meanwhile, said, the regulations are updated considering the increase in high-rise buildings in Colombo.
“Fire service departments come under the local government authorities. Now, the Urban Development Authority (UDA) looks into the quality and standards of the buildings. They request the fire department to submit a report before issuing the compliance certificate,” he said.
The owners of any building have to obtain a 'certificate of conformity' from the local government authority in the respective areas that it is situated. For commercial establishments, this also requires a fire safety assessment by the local fire brigade. Once the Fire Department gives the approval to the planning commission of the local authority, the certificate is awarded and people can move in. But, since this year, the Urban Development authority is responsible for issuing the compliance certificate.
According to Liyanepeli, the problems relevant to fire safety arises only after issuing the compliance certificate and added that the authorities should ensure that they comply with the fire prevention and safety standards.
He said, there are five main barriers which need to be considered during a fire risk assessment process and they are fire initiation, fire growth, smoke spread, facilitating occupant evacuation and facilitating fire department intervention. “In addition to that, it has been clearly mentioned in the same ordinance, that the occupier should inform and get approval from the factory-inspecting engineers on following matters: if, after the grant of a certificate, it is proposed to make material extension, material structural alternation of the factory premises, to increase materially the number of persons, to begin to store or use explosive or highly inflammable material in the factory, materially to increase the extent of such storage or use, the occupier shall give a written notice of the proposal to the factory-inspecting engineer,” he said.
Liyanapeli said, however, there is no law to conduct periodical fire risk assessment and to issue an annual certificate to ensure that the owners maintain proper standards.
“People give less importance to fire prevention system—at many instances, the builders tend to change the initial plan and when they change it, they give less attention for fire prevention system,” he said.
He highlighted the need to identify the hazards and urgent hazards in buildings and take necessary precautions and remedies.
Fire Service Department—totally ignored
“We have very effective fire service departments in high density areas like Colombo, Gampaha, Kandy. We do two inspections every week; if there are any issues or improvements that need to be made, we give them recommendation to improve,” said Fernando.
Acting divisional officer, Operation K.D. Wijesooriya, the Colombo fire brigade has three water bowsers, two ambulances, one rescue engine, two fire pumps, 4,000 – 8,000 litres of high-flow water, three hydraulic platforms, one foam counter and three support vehicles (jeeps).
However, these vehicles are more than 15 years old and the relevant authorities have failed to show considerable attention to replace these vehicles.
Wjisooriya said that they have informed the CMC on several occasions, pointing out the need to replace these vehicles, but even they are unable to do anything.
Fernando further said, with limited resources, they render a great service to the country in the wake of a crisis.
“In two to three minutes, we would dispatch the team. The time taken to reach the destination may differ during day and night,” he said.
Fire-Prevention Division Divisional Fire Officer Wimal Kularatne, meanwhile, emphasized that 60 percent of the buildings that are being constructed are super high-rise buildings and it is important to have a standard firefighting shaft in every building.
According to fire service department, up to 18m is a non-high-rise building, 18 – 30m is a medium-rise building, 30 – 60m is a high-rise building and Over 60m is a super-rise building.
Kulratne said that they do the outdoor firefighting up to 30m and above 30m, they need to do indoor firefighting and added that firefighting shafts include firefighting lobbies, temporary refugee areas, causality areas and life-saving equipment.
“All these need to be well-planned and maintained. Life-safety should be the priority,” he said.
He further said that there are many government institutions that are without proper fire-preventive measures and added that in government institutions, around 300 employees work in one floor and that it will not be very easy to manage if a fire breaks out.
“If we go for an inspection, we check the stability, integrity and insulation (stopping the spreading of fire). Smoke, heated air and thermal radiation are three main factors that people need to be protected in the event of a fire,” he said.
Despite a number of fires reported in Colombo, especially in old public buildings, the city’s fire brigade has no legal power to warn or take action against institutions not adopting fire safety measures. The Fire Brigade does not come under empowering legislation such as the Fire and Rescue Services Acts existing in other countries such as Britain, even though it has been in operation since 1890s.
Wijesooriya said the fire brigade has no legal power to make it compulsory for government and private institutions to conduct fire drills, maintain fire extinguishers and hose reels and follow safety procedures.
“Unfortunately, we only have powers to inspect and advise. It is a person’s choice whether to take necessary precautions and we inspect only when we are requested. Usually, the private sector ensures adequate maintenance, but the public sector often neglects its safety measures,” he said.
He further said neither the CMC nor the fire brigade can take the responsibility if any fire erupts in an authorized building.
Prank calls—a huge problem
The fire service department said that they receive a number of prank calls every day and added that it is one of the major issues before dispatching a group for rescue operations.
“We are sometimes fooled. They give us very correct details and a verification number as well. There were instances where we went to the destination, but there was no fire. People need to understand that we are doing a noble service, yet unfortunately, we are totally ignored,” said Wijesooriya.
He further said people do not directly contact their emergency call service that is 101.
“The public inform the police and the police inform us. Therefore, there is a delay in the communication process as well,” he said.
He noted that the Fire Department has a 24-hour fire emergency call unit and said the public can call 101 for help.
People can know the basics
Liyanapeli said, a study has also shown that inability to tackle small fires lead to huge disasters and therefore, we have opportunities to prevent huge fires by learning to combat small ones.
“If people knew the basics of how to combat fire at an initial stage, the spread of fire can be reduced. Small fires are very common in factories and failing to tackle it carefully would lead to a big fire. There is a mechanism for the factories and buildings,” he said.
Liyanapeli said, the Fire Brigade does not have power and they are just considered as a service-rending institution.
“They may not have enough resources to do that as well, according to the current system. They are currently used to extinguish fire, rescue people in case of emergency, to inspect the buildings and provide approval,” he said.
He stressed that relevant government authorities have not given adequate attention to the Fire Service Department. “The government and the relevant authorities need to pay more attention to impose law, regulations and standards, to ensure the safety of the people and most importantly, a mechanism to periodically check the standards of fire safety requirements,” he added.
