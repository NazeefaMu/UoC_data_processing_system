Dayasiri appointed third Co-Cabinet Spokesperson

Sports Minister Dayasiri Jaysekara was appointed as the third Co-Cabinet Spokesperson of the government.
His appointment comes in the wake of the SLFP making a request from the President earlier this month to appoint a Cabinet Spokesperson from their own party. The SLFP had also requested that Minister Rajitha Senaratne be removed from his current post as Co-Cabinet Spokesperson.
At present. Lands and Parliamentary Reforms Minister Gayantha Karunathilaka and Health, Nutrition and Indigenous Medicine Minister Rajitha Senaratne function as Co-Cabinet Spokespersons.
Mass Media and Parliamentary Affairs Deputy Minister Karunaratna Paranawithana said Minister Senaratne had not been relieved of his position but there would be three ministers to deliver the messages of the government, “This will be beneficial to the media. You will have more questions than answers now,” he said.
