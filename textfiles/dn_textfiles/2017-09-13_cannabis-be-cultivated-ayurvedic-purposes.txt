Cannabis to be cultivated for Ayurvedic purposes

There is a shortage of cannabis required to produce Ayurvedic medicine. Therefore, it is planned to cultivate cannabis in 100 acres with the assistance of the armed forces, Health Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne said.
He was addressing a ceremony held in Anuradhapura, recently. Minister Dr. Senaratne stated that the production of cannabis will be used to meet the requirement of doctors who produce Ayurvedic drugs and the additional cannabis production will be exported. There are issues in Sri Lanka because some are addicted to cannabis.
Minister Dr. Senaratne also said a new ward complex will be built for the Borella Ayurvedic Hospital at a cost of Rs. 1.8 billion. Around 600 books belonging to various Ayurvedic doctors will be translated into Sinhala under another project. The Health Ministry requests Ayurvedic doctors to provide their Ola leaf books to the Department of Ayurveda to translate them for the benefit of future generations. At the moment, some shops which sell Ayurvedic medicine look like hardware shops. Those shops need to be modernized similar to pharmacies, the Minister stated.
