Man found living in a cemetery for eight years

 
A 75-year-old man, who had lived in a cemetery for eight years, was discovered in Beliatta today.
The unmarried man identified himself as D.W. Ranaweera, a former resident of Pahala Hanwella.
Ranaweera was a Public Health Inspector (PHI) until he was convicted and jailed for bribery over 15 years ago.
He said he was released after filing a petition with the Prisons’ Department.
Ranaweera had thereafter taught English at a monastery in Anuradhapura and had held tuition classes in Kurunegala.
The 75-year old had finally settled down to live his last years at the cemetery in Beliatta.
The English-conversant Ranaweera sustains himself by feeding on whatever is received.
