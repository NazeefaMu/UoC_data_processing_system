Discrimination and violence
Symptoms of a greater disease

Leslee Udwin, film-maker and director of the controversial documentary India’s Daughter, which depicted the gang rape and murder of 23-year-old Jyoti Singh in 2012, now travels the world as an ‘education human rights activist.’
She was able to convince the Sri Lankan government to be the first in the world to implement her Think Equal programme in schools—to teach children at an early age about discrimination, and how to avoid it.
Excerpts follow:
Q : Would you like tell me about your childhood?
A: I was born in Israel, but when I was nine, my father took the family to South Africa. My father is a South African and my mother is an Israeli Palestinian (for seven generations). From South Africa, I decided to move to London for the sake of my career. Thereafter, I lived for eight years in Denmark and now I am back in London—it is my home now. The reason I mentioned these places specifically, was to emphasise that I am a global citizen. I have chosen my home and it is London. Particularly, what is significant about my background is, it comes from three places in the world where there is very serious discrimination. When I was in Israel, there was discrimination both ways between the Israelis and the Palestinians. Completely futile, unjustified, and destructive. Because we are like cousins, we think alike, look alike and act alike, and it is utterly ridiculous that there should be this divide between us.
Then, as a nine-year-old, I was taken to a place which was inhumane for the way they treated people on the basis of colour. What is important in my past is that I, as a child and as a young adult, was absolutely shocked. I was mystified by why these people were treated so badly and differently. I think that part of my background really informed and prepared me for the kind of work I did as an adult.
Q : You rebelled against a religious view at the age of 13. Could you share that story?
A: What I rebelled against was discrimination, not religious values. I went to a religious Jewish school as a child because my father was also a religious Jew. In a religious education class, one day I learnt that there is a morning prayer called the dawn prayer, that Jewish men say "I thank God who did not make me a woman," every morning. When I heard that, I was so hurt and angry. I ran in search of the Rabbi of the school to object to it, and they expelled me from school.
I respect people for having their religions, but they cannot and must not be discriminatory. They must be tolerant of other religions.
In Think Equal, we teach children that every single religion is beautiful and justifiable in the way of being grateful. We teach them that they are global citizens all over the world, though we have our own differences. So we teach them to celebrate these differences.
Q : What is the Think Equal project all about?
A: Think Equal is a global initiative that constructs and delivers an equality studies curriculum. We started a pilot project, and teachers have been trained for about a year now. We have reports from teachers and our hearts soar with joy. It is a transformational programmeme, it's really changing discrimination in children. There are four lessons a week and the children are looking forward to it. Think Equal was started two years ago and Sri Lanka is the first country in the world to commit to fully rolling this out, and we have other countries which have committed as well. We are really proud that Sri Lanka has taken this leading and exemplary start in the world.
Rosy Senanayake was the one who brought this project to Sri Lanka. She has given everything; her passion and commitment.
This programme was of a logical analysis; if it’s the mindset that is the cause of violence, then how do you change mindsets? It’s possible only through education. But if you could change mindsets through education, that would imply that very educated people do not do bad things, but they clearly do. Because, in the documentary I interviewed not just the rapists, but lawyers as well. The lawyers were much worse than the rapists. The deductive logic tells me then, that this is not about access to education, how many degrees you have or how long you have gone to school. If you are not taught the right things at school, you would go to school your whole life and still become a rapist or a murderer. Children have to be taught the right things, and therefore, Think Equal teaches them this during a time when we can change their attitudes and behaviour.
Q : You were an actress, then a film director and producer, and now an activist. Could you explain these changes in your life?
A: I was a filmmaker until two years ago, one of the films I made was called East to East, and it won the British Oscar. That was a film about tolerance. When I made a sequel to that movie called West is West, it did incredibly in many countries. In West is West, it depicted the world where there is discrimination on the basis of religion and on the basis of colour. It was a plea for all forms of tolerance. What I had been doing in my feature film also prepared me for this work. Then I made this one film called India's Daughter, which was my first documentary. In that film, I understood on a profound level, what the root cause of violence in our world was.
We as a world, treat violence as a disease. Where we are wrong is, the disease is not the violence, but violence is the symptom of the disease. The disease is the mindset of discrimination which causes violence—gender based violence, racial violence, religious violence, caste based violence, tribal violence. At the end of the day, it's discrimination that needs to be rooted out, if we are to stop violence in our world.
Through the 31 hours of interviewing rapists, I could clearly see that they were reportedly programmemed by their sincere cultural thinking to do what they did.
What are parents teaching their children? What do they see at home that makes them think that this is the way I should behave? If a girl is not obedient and does not do what I tell her to do, smack her because that's what I have seen. Because in our community, you can be violent with someone who is accorded a lesser or no value.
"Oh, that person is dark, do not play with him," or "That person is Christian, he is an infidel. Take his head off," or "That person is a Muslim, he might be a terrorist." These means of discrimination lead to violence and that's what we need to stamp out as a world.
Neuroscience is very clear about when the window of opportunity is to change human beings' attitudes and behaviour. It is a narrow window and it’s when kids are between the ages of 3 to 5 years. That is why we want to start the Think Equal programmeme in Sri Lanka during those years.
Q : Do you think movies make an impact in society?
A: They do, but the impact will not stay for long. It usually fades away and is soon forgotten.
It is like the Me Too campaign. How long do you think that thing will last? It comes and goes. Look at that amazing protests on the streets of Indian cities in response to that tragic and brutal gang rape.
All forgotten. Did they come out when the five-year-old girl suffered the same fate? They did not come out on street because they had done it already.
Films are very powerful tools for change, but they can only create awareness; they cannot actually lead to real change. And if they do, it's a very slow process. No amount of films are going to put certain things right. You need to start with the root cause of the problem, and you need to teach children, lay the foundation for a new generation who will become politicians, lawyers, and teachers. That is the only way to see change in the world.
Q : You were a victim of rape. How did that have an impact on your work?
A: It happened when I was 18, in South Africa. This was on a weekend when I went to a barbecue party and he told me that he had invited a number of people but when I got there, nobody was there.
It was only him. I remember thinking "This is strange. Why am I here?" I actually asked him and he said, "Come in. We are late." Because I stayed and trusted him, he then dragged me into the house and raped me.
I felt guilty, I felt that I should have known better—which is ridiculous. How do we blame ourselves for trusting another human being? It is tragic that I was so scared by what happened, and the forcefulness of it was so bad that I thought he was going to kill me. When he didn't kill me, I felt relieved that I got away with my life.
I basically didn't tell anybody about it for 20 years. I am very ashamed of that, for twenty years I kept it silent. My husband was the first person I told about it.
I understand more than anybody that in my culture, there is no shame associated with rape. I should have asked for help and reported him. But I was so frightened that people would blame me for believing in him.
I even shut up about it for 20 years. Therefore, nobody can tell that rape-reporting statistics are real; they are massively under-reported.
Even I, being strong and intelligent and not having to face the social stigma, didn't open my mouth. Therefore, rape reporting is likely three times than what they say it is.
Q : Did your past have an impact on the movie or the documentary you made?
A: No, genuinely, it didn't. The documentary was pure, incisive, and a careful analysis of the mindset of a rapist. It was a very loving and passionate portrait of the girl who was destroyed by this act. Because she could not have been named, what kind of a life was snatched from her? What were her thoughts? What did she wanted to be? What were her aspirations? In the media, she is just a fictional name.
One statistic on a mountain of statistics. I wanted her to be a real human being.
This was nothing to do with me and my past experience. In fact, my experience did not even surface for me, the only way it did was that I was terrified that when I sat facing rapists, I might hit one of them. I thought this anger that I suppressed for 20 years, might just wind me up. Therefore, I practiced. Before I interviewed these rapists, I interviewed others, and I never felt angry with anyone of them. Because these men were programmemed to behave and think, and they were encouraged to rape by society. I felt that we have to take responsibility for that.
Q : What would you like tell all young men and women out there?
A: Anyone can be me. Honestly, I am not a person who is trained to do what I am doing now. I have just been compelled to do it, because I believe with all my heart that this is how I am going to leave the world a better place.
I do not have any religion to rely on, so for me, it is not about going to heaven. For me, it's all about how I leave Earth.
