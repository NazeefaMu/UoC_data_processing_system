Passengers facing danger at Slave Island station

Passengers entering the Slave Island railway station are facing grave difficulties due to the unprotected construction work of the adjacent 45 storey building.
Planks, concrete and other construction materials had fallen into the station roof creating damage and threatening passenger lives.Passengers complain that the construction materials sometimes fall into the trains delaying the train schedule.
Passengers must also face breathing difficulties due to the bad odour emanating due to the welding work done beside the ticket counter.
Investigations were carried out by the authorities after the passengers alerted the station master and the police regarding this matter.
However, passengers said none of the measures proposed have not implemented yet, threatening the lives of passengers.
