‘Over 55,000 projects in three years sans propaganda’

Project Management, Youth Affairs and Southern Development Minister Sagala Ratnayaka said the government, over the past three years, has launched over 55,000 development projects in various parts of the country and spent over Rs. 1 million on each project.
"It's tragic that we have failed to communicate this effectively to the public. Development communication must be at the heart of government propaganda," he said yesterday, addressing a meeting on developing infrastructure in rural areas.
"There is a dire need of a comprehensive campaign on what we have done for the public. The people at grassroots level are unaware of the crucial decisions made at the top level. These issues need to be corrected. One would say it's too late now, but we must understand the importance of these corrective measures," he added.
"Development alone is not enough to stay on top of our game. Due value should be given to communication as well," the minister said, adding that immediate measures have to be adopted to fill this 'communication-gap'.
Home Affairs Minister Vajira Abeywardena, Prime Minister's Secretary Saman Ekanayake, Secretary to the Media and Finance Ministry Dr. R. H.S. Samaratunga, Secretary to the Project Management, Youth Affairs and Southern Development Ministry Gamini Seneviratne and Additional Secretary to the Prime Minister Saman Athaudahetti were also present.
