FCID quizzes Yoshitha on AG’s advice over land, house purchase

Son of former President, Yoshitha Rajapaksa arrived at the FCID yesterday morning, having been summoned for the second time.
Rajapaksa failed to answer their earlier summons on September 12 due to personal reasons.
The FCID had summoned him regarding an investigation into his personal assets; the purchase of a land and house on Mihindu Mawatha, Dehiwela and another land in Ratmalana. Sources revealed that he was questioned by the FCID, for over three hours.
Rajapaksa’s grant aunt, Daisy Forest too has been implicated in the case, the land in Dehiwela has been written to her name. The FCID on May 12 informed court that their investigations into the land were complete and the court at the time had referred the case to the Attorney General (AG) for further instructions. It was on the AG’s advice that Rajapaksa was questioned yesterday. The case on the land is to be taken up again on October 23.
