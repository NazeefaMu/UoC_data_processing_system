PPPs aligned with the SDGs

Unilever Sri Lanka, the United Nations Development Program (UNDP), and the United Nation Global Compact (UNGC) jointly announced the initiation of strategic Private-Public Partnerships around the country’s key Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) priorities, during a press conference on Thursday.
The partnerships are the result of the inaugural Unilever-UNGC forum held in August this year that brought together stakeholders from the public and private sector and civil society to discuss how Sri Lanka can best achieve the SDGS. Speaking at the conference, Unilever Sri Lanka Chairman Carlos Cruz said his company has taken the approach of doing well by doing good, generating projects that are aligned with the country’s agenda.
“Poverty alleviation, promoting green energy, and promoting sustainable agriculture practices have been brought up as country priorities. And to address all of this, we have come up with three projects: Project Grama Shakthi, Sunlight, and Sustainabilitea.”
Project Sunlight is an effort to promote the changeover to solar power for top-end retailers, and Project Sustainabilitea is an effort to ensure that the tea industry in Sri Lanka, which so many relies upon for their livelihood, is sustainable.
