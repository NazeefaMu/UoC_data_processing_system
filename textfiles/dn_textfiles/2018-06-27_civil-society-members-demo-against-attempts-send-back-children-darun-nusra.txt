Civil Society members demo against attempts to send back children to Darun Nusra

A silent demonstration was held opposite the Nugegoda Magistrate’s Court today, against the Probation Department and the National Child Protection Authority (NCPA), for attempting to send children back to Darun Nusra, a children’s home where these children had been sexually harassed.
The demonstration was organized by members of the Civil Society, condemning the response of the NCPA and Probation Department concerning this matter.
The Attorney Lakmali Hemachandra who represented the victims, said the children could not be returned to Darun Nusra, adding that the problem was that State Institutions had failed to find suitable government schools for the children affected to continue with their education.
Hemachandra said that during Police investigations, it was revealed that a male staffer of this home (Matron’s husband) was allegedly committing sexual offences, while both the Matron and Dr. Mareena Reffai , the founder of the Almuslimaath Foundation, which oversees the orphanage were aware of it, but had not taken any action.
The Civil Society members in a statement said that despite the ongoing investigations into the allegations of abuse, which not only include the alleged abuser but also the matron and the founder of Al- Muslimaath, the Probation officers had vehemently opposed the calls by activists for the children to be transferred out of Darun Nusra for their own safety.
They further stated that the Courts instructed the Probation Department and the NCPA to find suitable schools for the children, but for for the last three months, both institutions had taken no concrete action.
Instead, we were informed that a meeting called by the NCPA with the guardians and Probation officers in June 2018, the guardians had been either pressured to take the children back home or return them to Darun Nusra if they wished to continue with their education.
Hemachandra said that they had requested Court for the best interests of the children, to avoid sending them back, adding that the case would be taken up again on June 5.
