Smith returns home, Warner to captain

 
Cricket Australia announced yesterday that Steve Smith is leaving for Australia today to prepare for the next series after a short rest and that vice-captain David Warner would be taking over as captain for the remainder of the five-match ODI series against Sri Lanka.
“We had a discussion with myself, Darren (Lehmann, coach) and (chief selector Rod (Marsh) and we also consulted the selectors. It took a bit of convincing to get me over the line. In the long run but a little bit of break would do me a lot of good,” said Smith yesterday.
“It’s been a disappointing tour and for me as captain it’s been a learning experience. It’s been incredibly tough, we’ve been outplayed in the three test matches and it’s never easy coming to the subcontinent,” he said.
Australia’s next series in five ODIs in South Africa in September which will be followed by home Test series against South Africa and Pakistan before a tour to India. - ST
