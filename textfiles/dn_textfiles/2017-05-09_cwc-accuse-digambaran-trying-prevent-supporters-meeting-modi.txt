CWC accuse Digambaran of trying to prevent supporters from meeting Modi

The Ceylon Workers’ Congress (CWC) yesterday, said Minister Palani Digambaran was trying to prevent its supporters from attending the meeting attended by Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi in Norwood during his Sri Lanka visit.
CWC Central Provincial Council member Kanapathy Kanagaraj told the media that the CWC has been invited for a public meeting attended by the Indian Prime Minister at Norwood on Friday.
He said the CWC members visited the Norwood grounds on Sunday to inspect the arrangements as a large gathering of CWC supporters were slated to attend but added that Digambaran had prevented them from entering the ground. Kanagaraj said that in fact Digambaran had threatened the CWC members and told them they will not be allowed to attend Friday’s meeting.
Kanagaraj said a Police complaint was filed against the Minister.
