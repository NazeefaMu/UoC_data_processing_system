Croc numbers in Menik Ganga on the rise

Crocodile numbers have increased at an alarming rate in the Menik Ganga in Kataragama, and pose a threat to those who bathe and wash clothes in the river.
Devotees who come to Kataragama usually bathe in the Menik Ganga before they enter the Kataragama Maha Devalaya, but due the rising number of crocodiles, they now do not bathe there.
Residents urge the Wildlife Department to relocate the crocodiles.
