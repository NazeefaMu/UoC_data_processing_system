The Attorney General maintained that three accused, former Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Chairman Nalaka Godahewa, former SEC Deputy Director General Dhammika Manjira Perera and Tharunyata Hetak Organisation Sports Director Ronnie Ibrahim had conspired to misappropriate Rs. 5 million in funds which were granted as a sponsor to the Tharunyata Hetak Organisation (A tomorrow for youth) by the SEC and the money in question had been transferred to a bank account belonging to Ceylon Premium Sports Limited to promote rugby contrary to a decision of the SEC.
