Damaged hotel repaired within record time

A hotel owned by a Muslim businessman in Anamaduwa, which came under an arson attack on Saturday evening was repaired within 12 hours by the Traders Association, politicians, religious leaders and well-wishers in the area.
The hotel was opened within 12 hours after it was set on blaze. Around 300 people had volunteered to rebuild the hotel and Parliamentarians Palitha Range Bandara, Priyankara Jayaratne and politicians from all major political parties in the area and religious leaders of all faiths had joined both in restoring the hotel and in its opening. The hotel was opened with those involved in the rebuilding being treated to a dinner by its owner.
