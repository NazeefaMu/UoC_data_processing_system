‘Dr. Binod Chaudhary, a true friend of Sri Lanka’

Sri Lanka’s enterprises and companies are doing well and they don’t need any guidance, said Dr. Binod Chaudhary, the first and only billionaire from Nepal listed in the Forbes list.
He said some Sri Lankan companies have set up offices overseas and some are even listed in the London and New York Stock exchanges.
Speaking at the launch of his book ‘Making it big’ in Colombo, he said that today businesses have taken a different turn. “You find global taxi companies like UBER that don’t own a single cab, and hotel companies like B&B that own over 700,000 rooms in less than one year and also companies like Google, Facebook which are all over the world doing business without people not talking to its management.
Talking about himself he said that he is happy being a billionaire but sad that his country, Nepal was in poverty. He said that the 2015 earthquake not only shook the ground of Nepal but changed the lives of over 25% of the 25 million population.
“My aim is to see that the country elevates to the next level before I die and to achieve this objective I will do my part,” Chaudhary said.
He said that he may even take to politics once again if he could help in this crusade once again rather than being just one of the 600 members in the Nepal Parliament.
Commenting on the business he said that one reason for his success was he saw a potential of a project long before it even commenced and he believes that it’s instants and not the knowledge gained at business schools that helps to forgo business ventures. “What I am saying is that only business school knowledge is not enough.”
Dr. Chaudhary said that private sector is very important to a country’s growth and the living example was Korea where private brands like LG, Hyundai and Samsung helped to make the country a developed nation.
“It’s usual that businessmen help politicians during elections but then the politicians should not try to run the businesses when they are elected.” Commenting on Sri Lanka he said that the liaison was started when he met entrepreneur, Tilak De Zoysa at one of the international chamber forums.
“When I visited Sri Lanka there was a war going on and investors and tourists were rushing back. But I saw the potential in the country and invested in the leisure sector involving Tilak de Zoysa Jetwing and the Galle Face Hotels Group.”
He said that he loves Sri Lanka and when the country bleeds he is in pain. “My love for Sri Lanka and investments into the future don’t have bearing as to who or which government is in power.”
Meanwhile, former Foreign Affairs Minister and MP Prof. G. L. Peiris reviewing his book said that Dr. Chaudhary has been a true friend of Sri Lanka. “I can boldly say that he has done more service to Nepal in education, health and training sectors than the government of Nepal.
He also said that he is a good reader of the future since when he visited Sri Lanka for the first time several SriLankan aircraft were in flames at the Colombo airport after the LTTE attack. “Still he saw the silver lining in Sri Lanka and invested.”
He also said that Chaudhary is a good thinking businessman who met strong challenges with ease. “One he was framed for murder by a good friend but he proved his innocence. In another occasion when his loving father suffered a heart attack a close family circle member wanted 25% stake in the company. He successfully overcame these issues diplomatically.” He said that Chaudhary is a strong believer in brands and he would never ever forego one.
“He may drop a joint venture or even a partnership but never a brand.”
