Healing hands of Reiki

The origins of Reiki, an alternative medicine practice, are somewhat hazy, though most trace it back to Dr. Mikai Usui. Dr. Usui opened an energy healing clinic in 1921, in Japan, and coined the term. Though the tradition is not tied to any single religion, its origins are connected closely to Buddhist beliefs and practices. In Reiki, the healer is thought to transfer energy to a patient, treating a wide range of illnesses and diseases, both chronic and acute. This energy helps dispose of the toxins in the body that cause these conditions.
Reiki is now practiced all over the world, and around 50 hospitals in the United States reportedly offer treatment programmes.
Reiki Master Wijayasena Gangodage of Kiribathgoda came to the practice somewhat later on in life. A director of education who oversaw the administration of schools in Mahara, Biyagama, Kelaniya, and Wattala, Gangodage’s life changed when he temporarily migrated to America in 1989.
It was during this time that he became interested in Reiki and received instructions in the art of Reiki from his wife’s younger brother, who lived in Wisconsin. After moving back to Sri Lanka in 1990, he returned to his old job, but after retiring in 2000, he turned his attention to treating patients using the skills he had worked on for 10 years.
Here are the excerpts from
the interview with Wijayasena Gangodage:
Q: Can you explain the practice of Reiki?
A: Reiki is an old practice of healing through energy. There is a lot of energy in the universe, and this practice allows you to channel that energy into patients to heal them. We understand that “Rei” is the universal energy field, and “Ki” is the subtle energy that you give to a person for healing purposes. Normally, 90 percent of people can feel this energy. That energy is the main source of healing. In Sri Lanka, most people don’t know much about this, but all over the world, people practice Reiki.
Q: How do you treat people using Reiki?
A: First, I ask the patient about their illness. It can be anything, ranging from cancer, to infertility, to psychological disorders. Then I ask them to sit down on a chair, and I stand behind them and meditate while directing energy from my hands to the patient. I control the flow of energy. It goes all around the body. There are seven chakras in the human body: the root chakra at the base of the spine, the sacral chakra between the navel and the genitals, the solar plexus chakra, the heart chakra, the throat chakra, the third eye chakra at the centre of the forehead, and the crown chakra on top of the head. These form a straight line down the torso. The chakras are located near important glands, and they can control healing. The pineal gland, which is near the crown chakra, controls balance and brain function, and the third eye chakra is near the pituitary gland, which controls the endocrine glands. Next, the throat chakra is surrounded by the thyroid and parathyroid glands, where you get thyroxin. Chakras are places where energy comes and goes into your body. Energy comes from the universe, and I direct it through my hands to the patient’s body. But it’s also important to use your mental power with the energy stream. The results are better this way, because the mental power and the universal power get synchronized and react well with the patient’s body. I also use another way of healing, by getting rid of toxins. People get sick because the toxins that are absorbed into the body create blockages in various places. Depending on the location of the blockage, you get various infections or symptoms. A big issue is accumulation of toxins near the heart that block arteries. If you do Reiki, the blockages can vanish very quickly. There is almost no massage in Reiki, but sometimes you have to do some massage on the spine to elongate it and make it more flexible. Cases of scoliosis can be resolved through Reiki massage techniques.
Q: Is there any western medicine involved in the treatment at all?
A: No medications or drugs whatsoever.
Q: Can you explain the normal course of treatment? How many times do people come for treatment?
A: That depends on the illness. People who have diabetes must come for at least eight months, and sessions during that period of time. People with heart issues should come for 6 weeks. They should receive treatment for five consecutive days for the first week, and then three days per week for the other five weeks. Sometimes, people see results in as few as two or three days. Each treatment takes about an hour, so I see no more than seven patients per day.
Q: Are you the only person involved in Reiki treatments in Sri Lanka?
A: No, not at all. I have taught about 120 students. Out of them, about 10 to 15 are practicing in different parts of the country. I taught them right here at my home.
Q: How did you get involved with and learn Reiki?
A: In 1989, there was some confusion in Sri Lanka, and some people threatened me. So I went to America, because my wife’s brothers and sisters were there. I lived in Staten Island, New York. First, I went to California because her brother was there. He was attached to an American Airline. After staying there for two weeks, I came to New York. I stayed nearly two years in America. One of her younger brothers, who has a doctorate in food science, learned at Hawaii University. He then he came to Wisconsin and was attached to Madison University.
I went to Madison to learn because he was a master. This is the certificate I got from Ranga Premaratne, my brother-in-law. I got my first degree from him in Madison. After that, he went to Australia. My final degree, that is a Reiki mastership, I got from him in Australia. I got my first Reiki degree in 1990, and in 2000, I got the mastership.
Q: Why were you drawn to this practice? What about it interested you?
A: Well, my brother-in-law was talking about Reiki, and I found it very interesting. I knew I wanted to learn it. Also, my mother’s father was a navy doctor, and my eldest brother is a medical doctor. At that time, I thought of doing medicine, but it was a little too late because I had gone to the Arts Faculty and got a Bachelor’s degree in arts. But I wanted to do some kind of healing work, and I thought this would be good. Before 2000, I was a director of education, but after retiring, I started my practice here. I have treated more than 800 people.
Q: Have all of them made progress?
A: Most people who come for the entire course of treatment do better afterwards. Some people come for a couple sessions and stop, and they tend to have problems later on.
Q: Is Reiki related to Ayurveda, or other eastern medical practices?
A: No. Ayurveda also uses energy, but it comes through trees, plants, and nature. The energies are fundamentally different. Plants have specific energies. So practitioners of Ayurvedic medicine boil plants and make mixtures that have different energies. But here, with Reiki, we channel the energy through the palms of our hands.We make use of normal energy that is present in the universe. In Buddhism, there are four elements, matter, water, heat, and air, that are also the basic energies. Energy is everywhere, and it exists in our bodies, animals’ bodies, and plants.
Q: How has your life changed since you started Reiki?
A: I am 77 now. This is Reiki Jin Kei Do. Reiki you know, but “Jin” means compassion. “Kei” means wisdom, and “Do” is the pathway. You take the path with wisdom and compassion. As Buddhists, we must be compassionate. When you learn Reiki Jin Kei Do, you must become more compassionate so that you can heal people better. If you engage in Reiki, the energy that comes from the universe helps us to maintain healthy bodies. But I’ve also noticed that I have become healthier through doing Reiki, as the energy I transfer to the patients is good for both the patients and me. I think that’s one of the reasons why I look and feel young. In Buddhism, they say that you need compassion to help people. And then you need wisdom to see what is really happening.
