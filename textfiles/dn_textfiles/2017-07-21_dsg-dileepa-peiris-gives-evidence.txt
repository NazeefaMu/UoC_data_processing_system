DSG Dileepa Peiris gives evidence

Contempt of Court case against Gnanasara Thera:
Deputy Solicitor General (DSG) Dileepa Peiris yesterday identified Bodu Bala Sena (BBS) General Secretary Ven. Galagoda Atte Gnanasara Thera in the Court of Appeal as the person who involved in the alleged offensive behaviour at the Homagama Magistrate’s Court on January 25 last year.
DSG Dileepa Peiris gave evidence regarding the contempt of court action filed against Gnanasara Thera over his alleged offensive behaviour inside the Homagama Magistrate’s Court.
When the matter came up for inquiry before the Court of Appeal (CA) Justice L.T.B. Dehideniya and Justice Preethi Padman Surasena, DSG Peiris informed that in the evening of January 25, 2016, he got to know through a policemen at the court premises that Ven. Gnanasara Thera unexpectedly began to address the Court after the court hearing pertaining to the disappearance of journalist Prageeth Eknsligoda was just over.
Former Homage Magistrate Ranga Dissanayake, who is now serving as a Colombo Additional Magistrate, informed Court that he was to take legal action firmly against the monk since the offence took place in his presence. He further said he had never experienced such an offensive behaviour by a person in his 12-year judicial career. Magistrate Ranga Dissanayake made this remarks in response to a query made by President’s Counsel Manohara de Silva.
Magistrate Dissanayake yesterday concluded his evidence and DSG Peiris will be further testified on next inquiry date.
“Gnanasara Thera started addressing Court without obtaining permission thus obstructing court proceedings. He tended to challenge the judicial authority stating that he would not accept ‘White Man’s Law’ (suddage neethiya) and requested to release remanded suspects. I instructed him not to behave in a manner that obstruct Court proceedings, but he continued to do so,” the Magistrate said.
“Gnanasara Thera began to intimidate Deputy Solicitor General Dileepa Peiris, who appeared on behalf of the Attorney General branding him and members of Attorney General Department as ‘Napunsakayo,’ (impotent persons) he said.
The evidence was led by Senior Deputy Solicitor General Rohantha Abeysuriya. President’s Counsel Manohara de Silva appeared for Gnasara Thera.
The Court of Appeal proceeding has listed eight persons, including Homagama Magistrate Ranga Dissanayake, Deputy Solicitor General Dileepa Peiris and Counsel Upul Kumarapperuma as witnesses.
Further inquiry into the matter fixed for July 26.
At a previous occasion, the Court of Appeal decided to overrule the preliminary objections raised by Ven. Galagoda Atte Gnanasara Thera against the amended charge sheet.
Former Homagama Magistrate Ranga Dissanayake had referred the Contempt of Court action to the Court of Appeal since it is vested with powers to inquire such a complaint.
On a previous occasion, the Attorney General filed the amended charge sheet comprising four counts alleging that the accused had committed a punishable offence under Article 105 of the Constitution.
A charge sheet signed by Court of Appeal’s President Judge had been served on the accused on a previous occasion.
On January 25, Ven. Galagoda Atte Gnanasara Thera began to address Open Court after the court hearing pertaining to the disappearance of journalist Prageeth Eknaligoda was over. The Thera was arrested by police on the charges of contempt of courts, obstructing Court proceedings and intimidating a public servant.
The Homagama Magistrate has sought Appeal Court’s jurisdiction to consider whether the alleged offensive behaviour and utterance of Gnanasara Thera inside the Court amounts to Contempt of Court. He sought Court’s jurisdiction to take legal action against Gnanasara Thera if the charges levelled against him amounts to Contempt of Court.
