More than a child’s play

Drama is a unique tool to explore and express human feeling. Drama is an essential form of behaviour in all cultures, it is a fundamental human activity.
A high degree of thinking, feeling and moving is involved and subsequently aids in the development of skills for all other learning within and outside of schools (transfer of learning).
Drama is a discrete skill in itself (acting, theatre, refined skill), and therefore it is offered as a 'subject' in secondary school. However Drama is also a tool which is flexible, versatile and applicable among all areas of the curriculum. Through its application as a tool in the primary classroom, Drama can be experienced by all children.
The Awards Presentation Ceremony of the State Children’s Drama Festival was held at the Nelum Pokuna Mahinda Rajapaksa Theatre under the patronage of Internal Affairs, Wayamba Development and Cultural Affairs Minister S B Nawinna. The festival was held under limited and open categories in Sinhala, Tamil and English.
