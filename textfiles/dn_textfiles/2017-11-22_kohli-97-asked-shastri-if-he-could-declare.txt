Kohli on 97 asked Shastri if he could declare

India coach Ravi Shastri on Monday said “sky is the limit” for skipper Virat Kohli after his impressive 104-run knock against Sri Lanka in the first Test at the Eden Gardens.
“He is a fabulous player. The sky is the limit for him,” Shastri after the visitors held on for a draw in the series opener. Kohli’s ton in the 1st Test against Sri Lanka at Eden Gardens, Kolkata, which came on the back of a duck in the first innings, was his 50th in international cricket.
Interestingly, Kohli, batting on 97, looked at Shastri in the dressing room as it to ask “Should I declare?” However, Shastri asked him to bat for another over and complete his ton, reports TOI.
With not enough time for his bowlers to dismiss the opposition, the captain’s intention was to put the team’s interest before his personal milestone.
