Junior Davis Cup/Fed Cup Asia/Oceania Pre-qualifiers:
Sri Lanka battle in semi finals today

Sri Lanka entered semi finals of both Junior Davis Cup and Fed Cup Asia/Oceania Pre-qualifiers. Lankan lads booked their semi final berth when they beat Group 'B' leaders Syria 2-1 in the play-off tie worked off at the Sri Lanka Tennis Association (SLTA) courts yesterday. Chathurya Nilaweera won the fist singles rubber convincingly in straight sets beating his Syrian opponent Hassan Baroudi 6/1, 6/1 while Kavisha Ratnayaka followed him with a same fashion victory 6/3, 6/3 in the other singles rubber, grabbing an easy play-off tie win over Syria.
Singles winners Kavisha and Chathurya changed their attacking playing style in the doubles rubber and made a strategic retreat while allowing Syrians to make merry in a doubles match that would not affect the fate of the tie. Syrian pair Aous Abou Has Soun and Pierre Djaroueh were quick to bounce back with Lankan duo Chathurya and Kavisha playing casual tennis. Syrians won the first set 6/4 and Lankan duo conceded the doubles victory to Syria retiring 0/6 in the second set. Sri Lanka playing in the Group 'D' won two ties over Saudi Arabia (3-0) and Tajikistan (3-0) while savouring their only defeat at the hands of Vietnam opponents (1-2) before they rout Syria in yesterday's play-off tie. Sri Lanka will battle against Group 'C' unbeaten leaders Pakistan at SLTA clay courts in today's play-off tie, commencing from 8.30a.m. Hosts fared well at the group stage and ranked second behind undefeated Group 'D' leaders, Vietnam.
Yesterday's remaining Junior Davis Cup Asia/Oceania Pre-qualifying play-offs saw Group 'A' leaders Pacific Oceania beat Group 'C' number two Kuwait (3-0), Group 'D' leaders Vietnam beat Group 'B' number two Maldives (3-0), Group 'C' leaders Pakistan beat Group 'A' number two Bangladesh (3-0), Group 'A' number three Lebanon beat Group 'D' number four Tajikistan (3-0) and Group 'C' number four Bhutan beat Group 'B' number three Bahrain (2-1).
