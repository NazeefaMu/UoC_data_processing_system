Bellanwila Esala Perahera

The celebration of the Esala festival has begun, paving the way for both Buddhists and Hindus to recall the spiritual significance attached to multiple forms of veneration, such as pageants (peraheras) and poojas, in Sri Lanka.
For Buddhists, milestones in the Buddhist calendar necessitate the recollection of these sacred events with devotion and veneration. Some of them are the Great Renunciation of Prince Siddhartha in search of the eternal bliss of truth, conduct of the Buddha’s first discourse - Dhammachakka Pavatta Sutta, conception of Prince Siddhartha in Queen Mahamaya Devi’s womb, the performance of twin miracles (Yamaka Maha Prathiharaya), the preaching of Abhidhamma to the deities in Thavuthisa heaven, the Ordination of the first Sri Lankan into the Maha Sangha at Anuradhapura, the laying of the foundation stone and the enshrinement of relics at Ruwanweli Seya and the great revival of Theravada Buddhist Reformation at Malwathu Viharaya.
More significantly, the Esala Full Moon Poya assumes prominence since it heralds the onset of the rainy retreat of the Bhikkus, popularly called the Vas season, and is held across the country on a grand scale. It is owing to this combination of commemorative events that Buddhists fittingly observe this day ceremonially with the perahera, giving pride of place to the historic Sri Dalada Perahera in Kandy. In fact, legends also speak of how the Sacred Tooth Relic was placed for veneration in Kandy on an Esala Full Moon Day.
Parallel to the great spectacle in the hill country, many leading Buddhist places of worship across the island are in the practice of holding colourful peraheras with pomp and pageantry, including hundreds of dances and caparisoned tuskers and decorated floats. Of them, the Kataragama, Devinuwara, Aluth Nuwara, Bellanwila and Kotte pageants take pride of place as they are held on a grand scale and are crowd-pullers.
The Bellanwila Esala festival began in earnest in 1950 as a form of offering to the Buddha and the deities in response to an unfortunate cattle epidemic that pervaded Bellanwila and its suburbs, claiming the lives of hundreds of farming cattle and driving innocent farming communities and villagers into desperate straits. The late Ven. Bellanwila Sri Somarathana Nayake Thera, the Chief Incumbent of the Bellanwila Raja Maha Viharaya at that time, was much disturbed about what was going on in the area and summoned the people to the temple, where a sacred sapling of the Jaya Sri Maha Bodhiya remains planted for future generations to revere.
This far-sighted Thera conducted minor processions for three days round the temple and made special offerings to the Bodhiya pleading for an immediate end to this tragedy and urging God Vishnu to eradicate the epidemic. Surprisingly, his offerings worked well and the situation dramatically improved. That was the time when the Esala Perahara festival was initiated at Bellanwila, which has now grown to be one of the mammoth Esala spectacles in the country. The late Ven. Somarathana Nayake Thera developed the temple premises from its humble beginnings to what it is today and continued this Esala pageant up until his demise in 1984.
The Bellanwila Esala Perahera festival in 2018 is being organised by Ven. Dr Bellanwila Dhammarathana Nayake Thera, Chief Incumbent of the Bellanwila Raja Maha Viharaya and the Chief Sangha Nayake of Singapore, after the untimely demise of Ven. Prof. Bellanwila Wimalarathana Anu Nayake Thera in February this year.
The Bellanwila festival in keeping with age-old customs and traditions observed at the Sri Dalada Maligawa and elsewhere, prioritises the veneration of the Buddha with a week-long pirith chanting, through which the entire country and her people are blessed. The festival began after the planting of the symbolic kap on August 1 and the conducting of Dorakada Ashna Anushasana and the Deva Dutha Perahera, which again invoked the blessings of the Triple Gem on all Sri Lankans and people at large.
The four Mal Peraheras (pageants of flowers) that took place in the temple premises this year on four consecutive days symbolised the offerings to the Buddha before the remainder of pageants began. This year, the Pawada Perahera, which is regarded as one of the most sacred, will take place today amid a huge gathering of devotees, in which the relic casket of the Buddha and the replicas of deities will be carried on the head atop pawada (white carpets) spread along the way.
The Ransivili Perahera that takes place around the Bellanwila village, reminding the villagers of ancient practices, will be held tomorrow (10) with dancers and elephants. The finale of the festival, the Randoli Maha Perahera, the highlight with hundreds of dancers, drawn from many corners of the country, is scheduled to proceed along the Dehiwala - Mahargama road, Bellanthara - Pepiliyana road and Vihara Mawatha on Saturday (11), before it wends its way back to the temple premises.
The Chief Incumbent, Ven. Bellanwila Dhammarathana Nayake Thera, dedicated to upholding all traditions and conducting the Esala Perahera on a grand scale, has decided to add several new features to the perahera this year, as a tribute to both the late Ven. Somarathana Nayake Thera and late Ven. Prof. Bellanwila Wimalarathana Thera, the latter who did his best to conduct this mammoth festival uninterrupted, after the demise of his great teacher, Ven. Somarathana Nayake Thera.
The final Randoli Maha Perahera, will have many caparisoned elephants and dancing groups and is indeed one of the most spectacular and colourful annual pageants in the country. The whole of the arrangement is lavishly supported by resident Bhikkus - Ven. Boralesgamuwe Pemarathana Thera and Ven. Udugampola Hemarathana Thera and the Esala Perahera committee, the Dayaka Sabha, Kulangana Samithiya, Buddhist youth organisations, the Community Development Foundation, Tharuna Sansadaya, Buddhists across the island and many from the other faiths.
The Bellanwila Esala festival culminates on Sunday (12) with the ancient water-cutting ritual and the Deva Daana (alms) offered both at the Boralesgamuwa and Bellanwila temple premises, before the final Shanthikarma ritual invokes blessings on everyone.
