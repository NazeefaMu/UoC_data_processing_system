Dickoya Base hospital malfunctioning due to shortage of nurses:Hospital Director

The ICU and the Accident Service Unit at the Dickoya Base hospital could not start functioning due to a severe shortage of nursing staff, said Hospital Director Dr. Thilina Wijetunge. He said the new Unit at the hospital built with Indian aid was officially opened by Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi during his recent official visit to Sri Lanka.
Addressing a meeting of the Ambagamuwa Regional Development Committee held on August 29, Dr Wijetunge said the hospital which is an A Grade hospital, needed a cadre of 120 nurses for its proper functioning. But today, it had only a cadre of 60 nurses which was grossly inadequate.
There has been a reluctance on the part of the nurses to come on transfer to Dickoya due to a severe dearth of residential quarters.
The meeting held at the Ambagamuwa Divisional Secretariat was attended by Education State Minister V. Radhakrishnan, Parliamentarian K. K. Piyadasa and Nuwara Eliya District SLFP Organization Chairman W. G. Ranasinghe.
