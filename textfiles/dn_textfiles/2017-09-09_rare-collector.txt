Rare collector

Proud owner of 100-year-old lozenges:
A 70-year-old trader in Matuwagala along Eheliyagod - Idangoda Road nearly 10 kilometres off Eheliyagoda town, has a rare collection of 100-year-old colourful imported lozenges.
According to M. G. S. K. Melegoda, who is a former ANCL newspaper agent in Matuwagala, says his precious collection of lozenges contained in 72 small-sized bottles, was presented to him by his father prior to his death.
“My father was a grocer and these lozenges were presented to him by a friend who was a lozenges dealer prior to World War II,” Melegoda said.
He added that several lozenges and toffee manufacturers had offered him large sums of money for his precious collection, but he had refused to sell them.
“My father preserved this collection for us. So, it is my duty to protect this for our future generations," he said.
