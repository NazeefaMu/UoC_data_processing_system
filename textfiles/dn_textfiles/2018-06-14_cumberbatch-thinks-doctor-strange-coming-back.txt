Cumberbatch thinks Doctor Strange is coming back

We’ve been on tenterhooks since ‘Avengers: Infinity War’s cataclysmic ending, so we’ll take any comfort where we can get it.
It comes as a relief to hear that Benedict Cumberbatch thinks he’ll be back for ‘Avengers 4’ and ‘Doctor Strange 2’. Probably.
As you’ll no doubt recall, Strange was one of the heroes who was erased by the Infinity Gauntlet at the end of ‘Infinity War’ – but not before hinting that it was all part of his plan.
When asked about his future in the role, Cumberbatch said, “Oh, Strange? Just try to stop me. That’s all kind of lined up as far as I’m aware, but who knows? I mean, you know, the problem is, how does he get out of where he’s at. But that’s the only thing. I’m bits of dust at the moment as far as I understand. So you really have to ask [Marvel Studios president] Kevin Feige. But as far as wanting to do it, yeah, I would love to go back into that role.”
To be honest, we’re pretty certain that the ‘Infinity War’ deaths won’t stick, but we’re still happy to hear Cumberbatch agrees with that. Even if he can’t give an unequivocal ‘yes’.
‘Avengers 4’ will be releasing on April 26, 2019. ‘Doctor Strange 2’ hasn’t been officially confirmed, but we find it hard to believe it isn’t coming in Marvel’s Phase Four. Deadline
