Browns Agriculture gets longstanding award from Massey Ferguson

Browns Agriculture Division won an award from their principal partner Massey Ferguson, for being the oldest distributor , 65 years in South East Asia.
The Long-standing Relationship Award was presented to them at a gala event held in Bangkok recently.
Browns Agriculture is the first entity to have introduced innovative farming methods and revolutionised the Farming Industry by mechanising farming labour conditions; introducing Massey Ferguson tractors in 1952.
Starting off with the Grey Fergie specialising in paddy operations, the tractors evolved in to more innovative and efficient solutions such as the MF T20, MF135, MF35, MF 240, and MF 240 Super.
The organisation has, for the past 10 years been market leaders in the Tractor Industry, holding over 58% market share and has been constantly ranked as the best service provider in the Agri Machinery Industry. TAFE Tractors have been customised and enhanced both technically and practically and constantly adding value, with the customers’ needs in mind.
Massey Ferguson is part of AGCO Corporation and is one of the biggest names in farm equipment throughout the world with a 150 year history.
Browns Agriculture recently introduced its newest innovation, Massey Ferguson MF-1540, to the farmers in the Anuradhapura and Polonnaruwa districts.
This new tractor’s distribution has been more focused to the farming community in the wet zone area and those farming on muddy terrain.
Built with trusted Japanese technology, the MF-1540, is a tractor specifically customised for wet application (to be used in muddy terrain).
The unique features of the tractor are it’s a compact, lightweight machine, equipped with 4 wheel drive and synchro shuttle shift (easy back and forth loader work) mechanism. In addition, this machine has the lowest turning radius among all tractors. This is therefore ideal for working in small harvesting areas.
“It is both an honour and a privilege to be recognized by Massey Ferguson in this regard and humbled to acknowledge that this relationship will only grow in strength and trust in the years to come,” Browns Agriculture Deputy General Manager Sanjaya Nissanka said.
