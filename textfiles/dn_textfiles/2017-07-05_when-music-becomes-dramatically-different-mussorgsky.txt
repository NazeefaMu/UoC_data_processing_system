When music becomes dramatically different with Mussorgsky

Some time back when I went to the Queen Elizabeth Hall at South Bank Centre, London to hear and watch the International Piano Series directed by Krystian Zimmerman and Maurizo Pollini to celebrate the bicentenary of Fryderyk Chopin, I was in for a pleasant surprise. Though somewhat annoyed, I sat down with my friend to watch a drama unfold before my eyes that was simply spectacular. Instead of Chopin's Romantic scores for the evening, there arose Leif Ove Andshnes performing Mussorgsky's PICTURES at an EXHIBITION with stage design and visual accompaniment by the vibrant young South African artist Robin Rhode.
It was something I could not comprehend. I was not dreaming, for sure. Together, they redined the piano recital, presenting the aesthetics of a contemporary art gallery to the concert hall and created a new version of Mussorgsky's PICTURES at an EXHIBITION that was originally written to accompany paintings by Victor Hartmann where this new version created images for a 21st century performance. That version included a new work by Thomas Larcher and written to accompany visuals along with a performance of Schumann's KINDERSZENEN.
WHO IS HE? I had never seen or heard this Norwegian pianist called Leif Ova Andshes and believe me, he simply swept me off my feet. Potentially one of the great rising stars, Chopin had been at the centre of his playing. His fine musical grace and individuality has been already lauded especially in the glittering context with transcriptions and tributes to Chopin. He demonstrated a poetic sensibility rare in a youthful pianist that made the young South African artist Robin Rhode to rise to the occasion.
MODEST PETROVICH MUSSORGSKY Was born into a wealthy rural, landowning family. He began by picking out on the piano the tunes he heard from the serfs on his family's estate. At the age of six, he began to study piano with his mother. His parents initially set him out on the career of military officer.
He became a cadet and finally commissioned in an elite imperial regiment. Two years later, in 1858, he resigned his commission. During this time, he met a musically-inclined army doctor: Alexander Borodin. The two became friends. In 1861, with Russia's emancipation of the serfs, his family lost significant income, and he was forced to earn a living. In 1863, he began a spotty career in the civil service, which dismissed him at least twice.
In 1867, Mussorgsky also composed ST. JOHN'S NIGHT ON BALD MOUNTAIN (usually called NIGHT ON BALD MOUNTAIN), depicting a gathering of witches and demons for a black sabbath. While one can cite predecessors like Berlioz and Liszt for such an idea, nobody had come up with such crazy sounds before – shattering dissonance and wild cries as savage as anything in Igor Stravinsky's Rite of Spring, more than four decades in the future. Mussorgsky revised it at least twice to fit it into later, unrealized projects – Mlada (1872, a group opera by the Kuchka never completed) and the composer's own unfinished opera Sorochintsï Fair.
After his abandonment of The Marriage, Mussorgsky began working on a Stasov suggestion, the opera Boris Godunov. The composer completed a version in 1869 and submitted it to the Mariinsky Theater, who rejected it, mainly due to the fact that Mussorgsky had provided no role for a prima donna. Mussorgsky took back the score and at once began to revise it, altering the work far beyond what the theater had asked for. In general, he moved from the musical realism of the first version to a folk-based arioso, extremely subtle and flexible dramatically. He resubmitted his new version in 1872. The theater accepted it, and after some wrangling with the censor, Boris premiered in 1874. This was to provide Mussorgsky his greatest public triumph. He was considered theyoung man to watch.
Because he began late and died young, almost all of Mussorgsky's music can be considered early work. Yet he progressed at a frankly incredible rate, went through at least three major changes of style, and even conducted successful "one-off" experiments. His songs lie at the center of his achievement and form the basis of much of his dramatic work. There's an astonishing variety, from "realistic" portraits, to evocation of peasant song, dramatic monologues (from a child) in The Nursery (1870), psychological expressionism and a non-Wagnerian chromaticism in Sunless(1874), and a new pre-Mahler poetry in Songs and Dances of Death(1877). Instrumental works play less of a role, although even here he wrote masterpieces: the aforementioned NIGHT ON BALD MOUNTAIN and the piano cycle PICTURES AT AN EXHIBITION (1874). If he had composed only the last, he would be considered an eminence in Russian music. The piece is new not only in its details (bar-by-bar meter changes, startlingly original chord progressions and piano textures) but in its form – Romantic character-pieces linked by interludes varying a basic theme, with the final variation absorbed into the last character-piece.
Mussorgsky's music challenged the hegemony of German and Italian music in the nineteenth century and lay outside the standard Brahms-vs.-Wagner fight. He opened up a new musical path and a new aesthetic attitude. However, it's not his innovations alone that make him so important. Boris Godunov is arguably one of the three greatest operas of its time, the work of a musical dramatist of genius. Mussorgsky's songs, so little known in the West mainly due to language difficulties, put the composer in the exalted company of Schubert, Brahms, and Mahler, and show a greater variety of expression than all three. Patronized by the nineteenth century, the composer became a hero to the Twentieth.
