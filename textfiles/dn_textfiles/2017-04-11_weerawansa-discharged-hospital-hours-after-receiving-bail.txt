Weerawansa discharged from hospital hours after receiving bail

 
National Freedom Front (NFF) leader Wimal Weerawansa who was granted bail by the Colombo Fort Magistrate this morning, was discharged from hospital a short while ago.
The former Housing and Construction Minister was transferred from the Prison Hospital to the National Hospital following a hunger strike, in protest of the Colombo High Court refusal to grant him bail on March 29.
He was released on bail earlier today by the Colombo Magistrate Courts.
