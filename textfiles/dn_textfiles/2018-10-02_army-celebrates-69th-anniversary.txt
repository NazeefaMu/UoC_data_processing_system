Army celebrates 69th anniversary

The army's 69th anniversary celebrations were held last Friday morning, at the Temple of the Sacred Tooth Relic in Kandy.
Army Commander Lieutenant General Mahesh Senanayake was the chief guest at the event, and offered gilanpasa and muruthen, along with jasmine flowers during religious observances.
Following tevava rituals, the army commander made a donation to the temple at the Diyawadana Nilame’s office.
Lieutenant General Senanayake was also present at a sanghika dana in which 69 Maha Sangha members participated. The ceremony was led by Most Ven. Thibbotuwawe Sri Siddhartha Sumangala Mahanayake Thera of the Malwatte Chapter and Most Ven. Warakagoda Sri Gnanarathana Mahanayake Thera of the Asgiriya Chapter.
Buddhist monks later performed anusasana for the army, as well as penwedima rituals for fallen war heroes. The army also made pirikara and atapirikara offerings for the Maha Sangha.
In the evening, soldiers gathered with army flags at the temple gates before a flag-blessing ceremony was conducted along with the chanting of seth pirith. Ven. Gomagodaya Rathanasara Nayaka Thera of the Asgiri Chapter led the religious observances.
