Sports sector has collapsed: MP

Matata District UPFA Parliamentarian Niroshan Premaratne yesterday said the country’s sports sector has completely collapsed without a proper management.
Addressing the media at the National Freedom Front office, MP Premaratne said Cricket which made Sri Lanka popular internationally has collapsed.
He said Lasith Malinga, the only person with a backbone in the cricket team, has been subjected to a suspended ban of six months along with deciplinery action for raising his voice against the injustice. “Having a Sports Minister to handle the sports sector like this does not make any sense. Even a thug can do the same,” he said.
