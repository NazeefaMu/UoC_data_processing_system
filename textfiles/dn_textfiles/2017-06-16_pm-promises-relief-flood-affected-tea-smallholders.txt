PM promises relief to flood affected tea smallholders

Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe yesterday stressed the importance of renovating the roads damaged by the floods to enable the tea smallholders transport their produce to the factories.
The Prime Minister expressed these views at a meeting held at the Palindanuwara Divisional Secretariat after inspecting a number of areas devastated by the flood.
The Prime Minister was of the view that a collapse of the economy at grass roots level would have an adverse impact on the national economy.
“Speedy action is to be taken to revive the rural economy by rehabilitating the roads and tea estates of tea small holders which were damaged by the disaster,”the Premier said.
The Prime Minister also emphasised a comprehensive plan to provide relief to the people affected by the disaster in eight districts.
He gave instructions to the officials concerned to rehabilitate properties, hospitals and schools devastated by the flood.
Ministers Sagala Ratnayaka, Thalatha Athukorala, Wajira Abeywardena and Parliamentarian Lakshman Wijemanna were present on the occasion.
