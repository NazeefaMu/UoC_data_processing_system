Domestic cricket pushed further into the brink

Domestic cricket in Sri Lanka was pushed further towards calamity when the Colombo District Court on Monday decided to extend the enjoining order till March 20 to allow Sri Lanka Cricket to file proper objections against it.
The enjoining order was given on February 17 restricting SLC not to proceed with the Major limited overs tournament without including Negombo Cricket Club who alleged that they have been unfairly kept out.
Following Monday’s court order Sri Lanka Cricket summoned the 24 clubs that was to play in the Major limited overs tournament for an emergency meeting.
“We apprised the clubs of the court order and told them to come up with suggestions how best we could go ahead with this tournament without challenging the court order,” said K Mathivanan SLC vice-president and head of domestic cricket. “The clubs said that they would get back to us by Friday.”
In the mean time it is learnt that the SLC have proposed a district tournament since the club tournament is now on hold.
