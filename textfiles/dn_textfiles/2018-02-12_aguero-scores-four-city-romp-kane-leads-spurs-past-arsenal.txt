Aguero scores four in City romp, Kane leads Spurs past Arsenal

LONDON, Saturday - Sergio Aguero scored four goals as Manchester City extended their Premier League lead to 16 points and Harry Kane netted again as Tottenham Hotspur beat arch-rivals Arsenal 1-0 on Saturday.
After a sluggish first half in the early kickoff at Wembley, Kane jumped highest to head home his seventh derby goal in seven games and 23rd in the league this season.
Spurs, who would have won by a greater margin but for an inspired performance from goalkeeper Petr Cech, climbed two places to third while Arsenal sit six points adrift of Liverpool in fourth and Juergen Klopp’s side have a game in hand. At the Etihad Stadium Aguero and the brilliant Kevin De Bruyne, who added three assists, were in inspired form as City blew away Leicester in the second half to seal a 23rd league victory from 27 games this season.
“I think we played brilliantly today, the boys did really well and of course Sergio Aguero was a different class today,” Raheem Sterling, scorer of City’s opener, told the BBC.
