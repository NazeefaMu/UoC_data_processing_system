CTSU accuses Education Minister over 'politically-driven' appointments

Politically-driven recruitment made by the Education Minister in the education sector has resulted in a major crisis within schools, the Ceylon Teachers Service Union (CTSU) General Secretary Mahinda Jayasinghe said.
Addressing a media briefing held in Colombo yesterday, he said the Education Minister has given 2,000 non-academic appointments at national schools across the country based on political influence without following a proper and transparent recruitment process.
Most of these recruitments are from the Kurunegala district, especially from Kuliyapitiya.
These employees do not even obey the Principals and work on their own agendas in schools. This has created a lot of administrative problems at schools. There are over 3,886 vacancies for sports teachers island-wide. However, attempts are being made to recruit non-academic individuals as Sports Instructors who have not even passed G.C.E.O/L. Since these people come to work on school grounds after 1.30 pm, who will be held responsible for what happens during that time, Jayasinghe questioned. He said CTSU vehemently condemns the use of schoolchildren to hold a 2.5 mile long bridal veil in an attempt to set a Guinness World Record. “We urge authorities to conduct a transparent and impartial investigation, and reveal the responsible parties of this incident,” he added.
