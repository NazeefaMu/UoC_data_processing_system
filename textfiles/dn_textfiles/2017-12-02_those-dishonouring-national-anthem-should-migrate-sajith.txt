Those dishonouring national anthem should migrate: Sajith

“Those do not honour the national anthem should migrate to another country,” Housing and Constructions Minister Sajith Premadasa said
The Minister was addressing a meeting that followed the distribution of Visiri Housing Loans and cement bags to lower income people at Walasmulla recently. Minister Premadasa said 8,000 families in the Hambantota district were under poverty line since they lack proper housing facilities.
“I will resolve this burning problem before the next general election,” he said. He said he would provide 20,000 employments via his ministry alone.
“A large number of educated youth come from lower income group families.They will be given their due place before the next general election,” he said.
The Minster said a gramasakthi official would be appointed to each GN division to decentralise housing projects launched by the ministry.
“During the past regime, malpractices, corruption and robberies reigned the country. Under the yahapalanaya regime, the country is free of such activities,” the Minister said.
He said extremists in the north and east were trying their best to destroy the people and the country by igniting racism.
