Minister calls for transparent Grade One admission process

Education Minister Akila Viraj Kariyawasam has instructed education officials to publish detail of the Grade One admission process to safeguard the transparency of the 2019 admission process.
The officials were instructed to carry out impartial and transparent Grade One admission process to minimise injustices.
With this move, marking scheme and criteria, and addresses of the selected students among others will be published except the details that harm the privacy of students.
The Education Ministry believes that the Grade One Admission process can be streamlined with the move and it will be helpful to do away with all forms of misconducts in the process.
Parents tend to produce fraudulent documents to gain Grade One admission and that procedure prevents the children closed to popular schools from admission to them.
Attention was drawn to amend the Grade One admission circular regarding a few Acts and rules such as the Vihara and Dewalagam Act to prevent unfair procedures in the process.
