Government takes over Neville Fernando Hospital

 
The Health Ministry will initiate proceedings to bring the Neville Fernando Teaching Hospital under the Ministry of Health, the Ministry of Higher Education and Highways said today.
In a statement the Higher Education Ministry said the Neville Fernando Hospital would continue to operate as a teaching hospital under the Health Ministry.
Additionally, the Ministry said South Asian Institute of Technology and Medicine (SAITM) students who have passed their final MBBS examination would be given further clinical training – extending a month each – in the areas of surgery, medicine, gynecology and obstetrics, psychiatry and pediatrics, at the Homagama and Avissawella Hospitals. 
Subsequent to this training, candidates will undergo a mandatory examination under the joint supervision of the Sri Lanka Medical Council (SLMC) and the University Grants Commission (UGC) for provisional registration, the Higher Education and Highways Ministry said.
It added that the Health Ministry would also gazette the minimum standards for medical education in Sri Lanka, as submitted by the SLMC, with the approval of the Attorney General’s Department.
