‘Writing is a Necessity’


The first book I read of Anita Desai was ‘Fire on the Mountain’, borrowed from the university library during my undergrad days. It was not the kind of book I usually read, back then. Nanda Kaul, the protagonist was old. She had retreated to the high mountains to spend her last years in isolation with the fond hope of finding spiritual peace. Sure, the book was a slow-drip tale, slower than the 154 bus I took to uni and back every day. Yet, I read it in one breath. It was not the plot that captivated me, but the prose – prose that so courageously broke all of George Orwell’s celebrated rules for writers.
Now that I have read several other books by Desai I know for a fact that she uses a large number of words to make a scene more vivid, more alive. When you turn randomly to a page in a book like ‘Clear Light of Day’, you come across a description like the following – that of a cat descending a tree. “She came slithering down the satiny bark, growling and grumbling with petulance and complaint at her undignified descent. Then she was in Bim’s arms cuddled and cushioned and petted...” Later on the same page, we have a middle-aged character named Bakul sitting “flaccidly, flabbily” on a chair. A critic making a case for lucidity might argue that just one of those words could serve the purpose, but in Desai’s work adjectives and adverbs (carefully chosen ones, of course) accumulate to make a picture even more immediate. As critic Jai Arjun Singh says, Desai’s style shows us that good writing doesn’t necessarily have to be spare and direct. Also, her overdose of words sometimes conveys the perspective of a particular character – a thoughtful character who is not a writer by profession and who doesn’t have to feel conscious about using too many words. Seen out of context, “...growling and grumbling with petulance and complaint at her undignified descent” may seem like over-writing, but consider how this word arrangement reflects Bim’s perspective of her beloved pet, apart from adding humour and affection to the scene.

Desai is also interesting because of the way she looks at translators. In her latest work, ‘The Artist of Disappearance’ she writes of a professor named Perma Joshi who translates a novel from an Indian language — and finds that she loves how powerful it makes her feel. (This leads her to change the original text in the belief she is doing a favor to the writer whose work she is translating.) Desai says she based the story on translators that she has known over the years. “I realized that all translators, they all long to be writers themselves,” she explains. “If they didn’t have that longing, they probably wouldn’t be very good translators, but a lot of them do have that creative urge — and my character Perma Joshi simply gets carried away with that.” She says she has never felt that her own work was translated unfaithfully, but her daughter, Kiran Desai, once wrote a very funny book that, when translated into Scandinavian languages, didn’t make anyone laugh. “There was no humor left in it whatsoever.”
As one of India’s most celebrated writers, Anita Desai has been publishing for almost 50 years and came close to winning the Booker Prize three times. (Ironically, her daughter, Kiran beat her to it in 2006 for “The Inheritance of Loss.”) Desai’s novels include “Clear Light of Day” (1980); “In Custody,” which was shortlisted for the Booker Prize in 1984 and made into a film; “Baumgartner’s Bombay” (1987); “Fasting, Feasting” (1999); and “The Zigzag Way” (2004).
Talking about her childhood in an interview on CNN Desai said that from a young age she had wanted to be a writer. “My family would see me sitting in a corner, scribbling all the time, so they used to address me as “The Writer.” I just wanted my books to be on the bookshelf too.”
She recalls her mother who was German, was a wonderful storyteller. “She could tell us the familiar Grimm’s fairy tales, but as no one else has ever told them to me. I’ve never heard them so wonderfully embroidered. In the same way, she could tell us about things like Christmas in Germany, or Easter, or skating on frozen lakes and eating strawberries in summer. It was all like fairy tales to us — it didn’t resemble anything in our own world. We thought of them as these marvelous stories she spun, not realizing until we were grown up how much deep homesickness and nostalgia this must have come out of. She never spoke about that to us. I visited Berlin [years later]. At that time there was still a wall across the city, so it didn’t resemble at all what my mother had evoked in her stories. Besides, so much of it had been flattened during the war, and what had come up was a mostly modern city. It was very painful for me to go back and tell her that actually I couldn’t find any of the things that she had told me to go and look for.”
Desai wrote most of her novels while bringing up four children. When asked how she managed to be a mother as well as a writer in India she says, “As a woman, you’re expected to lead a certain kind of life. To do anything other than that is not looked upon as normal and one has to find a way to justify it. For instance, it wasn’t expected of me to have a career and this is something I fought against...I wanted to open a door and step out into the world which lay right outside. Step into it and see what was happening there, and write about that.”
She did not expect her children to follow in her footsteps and was pleasantly surprised when her daughter became a writer. “All my children told me they never wanted to become writers,” Desai recalls. “They said, ‘You lead such a boring life. We don’t want to live like you do.’ “
Nevertheless she had always told her daughter Kiran that she wrote wonderful letters, but it wasn’t until Kiran’s college professors encouraged her to write that she really took it seriously. Now the mother and daughter write together, in the same house. “It’s wonderful to be able to talk about our work, about each other’s work, about the books we are reading,” says Desai.
As with most writers, Desai too is never satisfied with what she writes. Usually, a feeling of disappointment follows the book,” she confesses. “Because what I hoped to write is not what I actually accomplished. However, it becomes a motivation to write the next book.”
