Reduce whale-watching prices: Fisheries Minister

 
Fisheries and Aquatic Resources Minister Mahinda Amaraweera urged boat owners touring whale watches, to stop charging high fees from tourists.
Foreign tourists are not entitled to special privileges the Minister said.
Minister Amaraweera said that foreign tourists should not be swindled since it will harm the reputation of the country and tourism industry.
The Minister requested to reduce the boat fee to at least Rs 4,000.
The Mirissa and Kapparatota coastline and the Fishery harbour are densely inhabited by Whales and these areas are visited by many foreign tourists.
These foreigners are transported by fishing vessels to a fee of Rs. 6,000 per person for a trip Minister Amaraweera said.
The Fisheries Minister said that he has received many complaints against this unreasonable charge.
Minister Amaraweera added that he is hoping to initiate a Green Harbour center in Mirissa and Kapparatota harbours.
The Minister also hopes to establish an attractive multi-storey tourist center  with a sea food center operated by CFHC, to  ensure foreign tourist’s comfort for an estimated cost of Rs 500 million.
