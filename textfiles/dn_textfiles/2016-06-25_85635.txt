Rushan Jaleel Trinity's new Cricket Head Coach

Up and coming coach Rushan Jaleel, a former captain, who played a key role for Trinity College has taken over as the overall head coach for strategic planning, development and implementation of cricket for his alma mater. Last season's coach Kavinda Jayasuriya will continue as the head coach of the senior side, and the two senior players eyeing for the captaincy are Hasitha Boyagoda and Shanmuganathan Shanogeeth.
Rushan born October 7, 1990 was a right-arm off-spinner and right-handed bat. He played for Sri Lanka under 19 and for Ragama CC. He represented his school for five years and enjoyed his cricket. His worthy contribution towards his school was capturing over 125 wickets and also wielding the willow with great success. The turning point in his career was when he changed his bowling style, from fast bowler to spin on the advice of his junior coach Julian Arnolda, a product of St. Sylvester’s College and Sampath Perera who polished his cricket and within a very short period transformed him into an impressive cricketer. He won colours and Lion for cricket.
Sevens rugby on July 30-31
The Sri Lanka Rugby Football Union will organize a National Rugby 7's tournament in Kandy on July 30 and 31 at the Nittawela rugby stadium, where t date eight teams have confirmed their willingness to play.
Some the clubs who are expected to take the field are Kandy SC, CR and FC, CH and FC, Havelock SC, Police SC, Army SC, Navy SC and Air Force Sb. These teams are expected to field a few overseas players.
Why aren’t ruggerites taking to refereeing?
In Kandy, according to statistics there are top rugby players retiring from the game but shying away from contributing towards the upliftment of it by becoming rugby referees with their knowledge and experience. In the good old days it was top players who after retirement took to the whistle and kept the game going. This season at most of the school matches there have been unwanted incidents probably because there are no properly qualified people to handle the whistle. In most instances players and spectators have abused and threatened to assault referees or the linesmen, due to poor refereeing. Some of the great players who after giving up the game took to refereeing that come to mind are Col. Bertie Dias, Ashey Cader, Miles Christofelsz, Malcolm Wright, John Banks, Mohamed Azain, C.H. Seneviratne, Mohan Sahayam, Harry Gunatilake, Gamini Fernando, Col. C.S. Fernando, Lt.Gen. Denzil Kobekkaduwa, Anton Benedict, Ana Saranapala, Nimal Lewke, Tony Amith, Daya Jayasundera, Frank Hubert, S.W. Chang, A.R,M.A. Moosa and Bently Barsenbach. There was also a top referee who never played the game in Darley Ingleton who blew in 1960’s and mid 1970’s. Later we had Dilroy Fernando one of the most qualified of the present era, Anura Jayasekara, Nizam Jamaldeen, Anil Jayasinghe, Orville Fernando, Wimal Senanayake, Roshan Deen, Asela de Silva, Metha Abeygunawardene, Shamlath Fernando and Sanjeewa Saranapala who were much sought after.
Cricket: Sydney Masters vs Kandy Veterans
A 30-over cricket match will be played at the Pallekelle Stadium on August 11 with players above 50 years between Sydney Masters and Kandy Veterans. The Sydney Master team will comprise mostly of Sri Lankans. Kandy Veterans ream will comprise of cricketers from Kandy who are not involved in coaching and umpiring.
Havies center scrums up the hills
Last season's Havelock Sports Club center Dhanushka Ranjan has crossed over to the Kandy Sports Club and if he performs well at practices may get the chance to play for the defending champion club when the inter-club season kicks off at the end of October. Kandy SC are blessed with some top class ruggerites in the country.
Shame on Kandy schools
Though it was another exciting and history-making season for schools rugby, it was a shame for schools in Kandy that none of them were able to hit the top and win a trophy. Trinity and St. Anthony’s played in the “Cup”, St. Sylvester’s and Vidyartha played in the “Bowl”, Kingswood and Dharmaraja in the “Plate”. All schools, old boys and their rugby wings gave their best support for the game and all schools had sponsors. Every school had coaches for every department, forwards, scrum halves, backs, goal kicking and fitness training. Is it the coaches who failed to deliver and get the best of the teams? Most of the schools were not happy with the manner in which matches were officiated. Match officials are responsible for enforcing the laws of the game during a match and imposing sanctions on individuals who do not follow the rules. Every match is under the control of match officials who consist of the referee and two touch judges or assistant referees. Sad to say Trinity College is not taking part in the inter-school knockouts, and in their place St Anthony’s College will come in. Another sad affair is that the Rajans ended their season on a bad note.
Kandy’s Ransilu does well at Asian power lifting
The Asian power lifting championships was held in Udaipur India, where 16 countries took part with 250 participants. Former Kingswoodian Ransilu Jayathilake won the first ever medal in the event, and managed to set three records in the 120 kg category, squat 270 kg, bench press 150 kg, dead lifts 305kg, with an overall total of 735 kg. He has qualified to represent the country at the world championships in USA in November.
Two Kandy school products excel
Two Kandy school products Sachith Pathirana and Niroshan Dickwella, who both learnt their cricket at Trinity College, left for England with the Sri Lanka “A” cricket team on a month long tour. Sachith is a good all-rounder and Niroshan a wicket keeper/batsman.
Trinity U-15 A team enters second round
Trinity College under 15 “A” side with one outright win, two first innings wins and three no decisions have entered the second round. Thanks to the efforts of skipper Jeff Wijesinghe who has two half centuries and Nagitha Wijesundara with 21 wickets. Others who did well are Umair Rains, Kevin Perera, in batting, Nakitha Wijesundara, Deemantha Bandara, Kavidu Dias, Gagana Udakotuwage in bowling and all-rounders Abishek Anandakumara, Agbo Amarasinghe, Pamith Balasooriya and Shane Gunathilake.
