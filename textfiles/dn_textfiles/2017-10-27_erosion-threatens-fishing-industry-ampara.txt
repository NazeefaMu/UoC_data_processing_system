Erosion threatens fishing industry in Ampara

The Thirukkovil coast is badly affected by sea erosion. Due to erosion the beach area has been completely disappeared.
The Thirukkovil Divisional Secretariat Division in the Ampara district supports the fishing industry.
The land from Thambaddai to Sangamankandy are being swallowed by the sea due to erosion over the past few weeks.
The fishing camps of the fisherman, fishing boats and other equipment have been damaged due to erosion and the fishing industry in the area is paralysed.
The fisherman have no place to park their fishing boats due to erosion of the beach. Further, more than hundred acres of coconut estates on the sea shore have also been damaged.
Sea erosion is common to the coastal area, but after the Oluvil Port construction, erosion has increased at an alarming rate . Due to this, villagers are fearful of their properties being engulfed by the sea.
There are many fishermen in the Ampara district coastal area who are engaged in shallow water fishing and deep sea fishing industry.
