Sri Lanka makes three changes

Sri Lanka made three changes to their squad for the upcoming third and final leg of the Asian Sevens Series Men’s rugby tournament which will get underway on October 15 and 16 at the Racecourse international stadium in Reid Avenue.
Winger Saliya Handapangoda has been ruled out due to a hamstring injury while centres Sashan Mohamed together with Hirantha Perera have been left out for reasons best known to the selectors.
Hadapangoda and Mohamed have been replaced by Havelock SC players scrum half Kevin Dixon and forward Sudarshana Muthuthanthri while Kandy SC forward Jason Dissanayaka gets the nod as replacement for Hirantha Perera.
“We are definitely looking at winning the Cup championship in Colombo while we are also keeping our hands crossed to see whether if there’s any possibility that we could get our self-selected for the upcoming world series rugby sevens,” chairman of selectors Michael Jayasekara said.
Sri Lanka Sevens team played a brilliant tournament under Danushka Ranjan where they were deprived of a certain Cup championship due to referee awarding a knocked-on match wining try to winners Hong Kong thus losing 22-17 and finishing second in the first leg in Hong Kong. They remained runners up to the same opponents once again losing 36-nil two weeks ago in the second leg played in Korea.
For the third leg Sri Lanka has been drawn in Pool B, alongside China, Chinese Taipei and Singapore. Pool A will feature first leg winners Hong Kong, South Korea, Japan and Malaysia.
The Tuskers will play their first game against Chinese Taipei on October 15 at 13.12pm, against Simgapore at 16:08pm and against China at 19:04pm on the opening day.
