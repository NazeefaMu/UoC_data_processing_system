The Sabaragamuwa Public Service Commission (SPSC) won the merit award of the ‘National Quality Award 2016’ for their continuous dedication towards maintaining overall quality and productivity standards in management. Sabaragamuwa Public Service Commission Secretary Sunethra Gunawardena received the merit award at the National Quality Award 2016 ceremony in Colombo recently under the patronage of Science and Technology Minister Susil Premajayantha.

In line with the annual National Quality Award ceremony, the SLSI offers ISO certificates to public and private institutions. An ISO certification certifies that a management system, manufacturing process, service or documentation procedure has all the requirements for standardization and quality assurance of public and private institutions.
According to Sabaragamuwa Provincial Public Service Commission Secretary, the commission won several quality awards including the island’s first quality award in the public sector category of the National Quality Award 2007. The Commission also received ISO 9001:2008 and ISO 9001:2015 certificates of the SLSI. Sabaragamuwa Province Governor Marshal Perera, Chief Secretary Herath P.
