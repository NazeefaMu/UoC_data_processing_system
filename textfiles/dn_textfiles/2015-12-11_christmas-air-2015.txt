Christmas in the Air 2015

The Thomian Society, which has been renowned for producing the most colourful events in the calendar, are now all set and ready to provide a glittering evening of music, song and dance on Saturday December 11 at the Lotus Room of the Grand Oriental Hotel, Colombo 1 from 8pm.
Nalin and the Star Combination will be entertaining the crowd while the compere for the evening will be the incomparable and inimitable Master of Ceremonies Vijaya Corea. This colourful evening will move on from Christmas Carols to singing the Golden Oldies and then on to dancing. A sumptuous buffet dinner in addition to many prizes and surprises will make purchasing the ticket an opportunity not to be missed.
It will be wise to pick up the tickets from the reception at the Grand Oriental Hotel before they are sold out. It would be equally enjoyable to form tables of ten and have a great time of fun and fellowship with friends and loved ones, especially with “Christmas in the Air”.
For more information please call Major General Lohan Goonewardene on 0777718694.
