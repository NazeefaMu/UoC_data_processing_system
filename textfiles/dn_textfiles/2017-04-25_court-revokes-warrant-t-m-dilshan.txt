Court revokes warrant on T. M. Dilshan

 
The Colombo Fort Magistrate Court revoked the arrest warrant issued on former Sri Lankan Cricket team captain Tillekaratne Dilshan, after he surrendered to court today.
The Colombo Fort Magistrate Court issued the arrest warrant against Tillekaratne Dilshan yesterday for failing to pay his monthly maintenance fee and insurance for his child from a previous marriage.
The warrant was issued due to the absence of the former captain during the hearing of the maintenance case filed by his former wife Nilanka Withanage.
The Magistrate ordered that the case be heard again on May 24.
