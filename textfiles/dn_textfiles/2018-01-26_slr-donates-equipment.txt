SLR donates  equipment

 Sri Lankan-born Nazoomi Azhar who was born and educated in Sri Lanka (Trinity College Kandy) and currently based in the UK has come forward to work with Sri Lanka Rugby to help less privileged children.
This is the second instance that Nazoomi has been able to supply Sri Lanka Rugby with rugby equipment, clothing, boots etc. Everything was sent to Sri Lanka free of charge with the help of Vdoc, SriLankan Airlines and SOS Kit Aid.
Priyantha Ekanayake, CEO of Sri Lanka Rugby stated that he was delighted with the offer and added that they have promised to keep supplying equipment and clothing to less privileged children and to promote the game in the rural areas.
Currently Sri Lanka Rugby is on a very aggressive plan to take the sport to rural areas and they had a Rugby Awareness Program in the Kuliyapitiya district with over 900 girls and boys attending the event. Some of the clothing was given to these children.
They also donated equipment and rugby boots to Science College Mount Lavinia and also to C.W.W. Kannangara Maha Vidyalaya Colombo and to some of the schools that have been struggling to get sponsors but doing a yeoman service.
Sri Lanka Schools rugby is probably the most popular event in the sports calendar behind international cricket where you attract 3000 to 5000 spectators for a match.
The success of Sri Lanka Cricket was that they are able to take the game to the rural areas and Sri Lanka Rugby are also trying to do something similar on those lines.
Ekanayake also stated that he would like to thank the Sports Ministry, the Minister of Sports and the Director General of Sports for their support and also wanted to personally thank Nazoomi Azhar, SOS Kit Aid, Vdoc and SriLankan Airlines for their magnanimous gesture.
