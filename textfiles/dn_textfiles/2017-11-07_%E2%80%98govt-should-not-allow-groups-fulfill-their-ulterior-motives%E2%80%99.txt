SAITM issue
‘Govt. should not allow groups to fulfill their ulterior motives’

Megapolis and Western Development Minister Patali Champaka Ranawaka urged the government not to allow certain groups to fulfill their ulterior political motives by exploiting the issue relating to the South Asian Institute of Technology and Medicine (SAITM).
Minister Ranawaka pointed out that the same groups creating politically motivated resistance towards the SAITM are the same who introduced the issue to the country in the first place. Reflecting back to the tense situations risen with regard to the North Colombo Medical College two decades ago, Minister Ranawaka pointed out that the present generation must never go through a situation like that again due to the SAITM issue.
“At the previous regime, we advised then President Rajapaksa about this SAITM issue. But he continued with it anyway, because he wanted to start a similar medical college in Sooriya Wewa. Basil Rajapaksa wanted to start another such medical college in Diwulapitiya. Gotabaya Rajapaksa wanted to establish a similar medical college in Deniyaya. He wanted to open the Kothalawala Defense University to the outsiders as well, apart from the military,” Minister Ranawaka said.
“All these people with all of these ulterior motives wanted SAITM to be their stalking horse. They wanted to make way for their intentions through SAITM. We may have people with similar thinking among us as well,” he added.
Minister Ranawaka requested President Maithripala Sirisena and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe to finalize a solution to the SAITM issue with no more delays.
Minister Ranawaka also pointed out that the SAITM issue has caused series of protests, delayed 7,000 government medical students from completing their education, 3,000 interns awaiting their internships, 2,000 waiting to sit for the Act 16 examination, 1,500 students waiting for enrollment in medical faculties and 1,000 SATIM students who are at a dilemma of their education.
Considering such delays entangled with the SAITM issue, Minister Ranawaka said it is high time that the government comes up with a lasting solution to the matter. He pointed out that the proposals presented by the deans of State medical faculties and the Federation of Faculty of Medicine Teachers’ Association are simple, straightforward solutions with which the government should go with.
He observed that these proposals have considered all dimensions of the issue, including as to what happened to the students already enrolled at SAITM and believed that they were not suggestions tampered with political motives. Minister Ranawaka also said that complementing to these proposals, the Sri Lanka Medical Council has also put forward their standpoint on the minimum standards for medical education. The minimum standard of medical education should be gazetted soon, he said. Minister Ranawaka further said that private education policies should not be mixed up with the SAITM issue.
“No one should attempt finding a framework for promoting private education using the SAITM issue as a way out. The SAITM issue is an isolated problem which needs to be addressed sooner than later,” Minister Ranawaka added.
Minister Ranawaka said that SAITM, if it is to be amalgamated, it should be done with a government institution. He also said if more students are to be enrolled in this institution, it should be done on the basis of Z-score and fair charges.
