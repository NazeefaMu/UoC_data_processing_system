School Monitoring Board to improve quality of education

The Education Ministry has planned to set up a School Monitoring Board aimed at improving the quality of school education in the country, said Education Minister Akila Viraj Kariyawasam.
‘This board will be entrusted with the task of monitoring not only education, but also the material resources available in schools, Minister Kariyawasam said.
The Minister was speaking as the Chief Guest at the annual Prize Day of Viharamadevi Balika Vidyalaya, Kandy on November 18.
The Minister said government, as well as private and International schools, would come under the scrutiny of this Board which would come into operation in January next year.
Minister Kariyawasam said school inspectors performed an excellent job in the past. But, their services deteriorated later as school inspection was done after giving prior notice to the respective principals, resulting in the deterioration of the standard of education.
“This shortcoming would be addressed, with the setting up of the School Inspection Board,” he said. The Minister said his ministry had now taken measures to restructure the Department of Examinations too.
