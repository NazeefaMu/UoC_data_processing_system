Dengue tops 24,000, 23 confirmed deaths

A total of 24,518 dengue cases and 23 confirmed dengue deaths had been reported up to
June 28 from all parts of the country, the Epidemiology Unit said.
According to the epidemiologists, the highest number of dengue cases, 4,176 had been reported from the Colombo district while the second highest number, 3,539 had been reported from the Baticaloa district.The third highest number of dengue cases, 2,085 had been reported from the Gampaha district.
The Colombo Municipal Council (CMC) reported a total of 1,111 dengue cases during the same period. The other parts of the Colombo district recorded a total of 3,065 dengue cases. The total number of dengue cases reported from the Western Province is 7,752, the epidemiologists said.
Meanwhile medical experts and consultants advise the public to seek medical treatment without delay for any type of fever without applying home remedies. All fever patients need rest and they should not attend work or school.
All fever patients should take Paracetamol only. All the other medications, especially Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) such as Ibuprofen cause Dengue Hemorrhagic Fever (DHF) which can become fatal, they said.
People should keep their premises free of dengue mosquito breeding sites (water harbouring places) during this rainy season in order to prevent dengue.Even water retained in a pen clip or a bottle top is adequate for the dengue mosquitoe to breed, they added.
