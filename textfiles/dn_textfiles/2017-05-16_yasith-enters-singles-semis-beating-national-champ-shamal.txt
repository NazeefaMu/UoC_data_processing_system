Second seed Yasith De Silva toppled the more fancied reigning national singles champion and fifth seed Shamal Dissanayaka in straight sets (7-5, 6-2) during a men’s singles quarter final battle of the ongoing SSC Open Tennis Championship continued at the SSC clay courts yesterday. Shamal has already booked his berth in Sri Lankan Davis Cup team and was in fine form until yesterday’s shock defeat.
Unseeded Mufazal Hossain came from behind to create an upset as he recovered from a first set defeat to beat eighth seed Avindra Perera in a hard fought men’s singles pre-quarter final battle (6/7(11), 6/3, 6/2). Mufazal will meet Yasith in semis.
Top seeded Heera Ashiq had no problem in continuing his winning streak when he edged out Nishangan Nadarajah in a straight set pre-quarter final (5/5, 6/3) of the men’s singles event. The other men’s singles pre-quarter battle saw third seed Sankha Athukorala beating Dumindu Dilum (6/4, 6/2). Sankha will take on Heera Ashiq in the other semi final.
Meanwhile in the women’s singles event, another major upset was created by unseeded Rukshika Wijesooriya who beat the top seed Janali Manamperi in easy straight sets (6/1, 6/3). She will meet Senuri Alexander in semi finals who received a walkover from third seed Prabuddhi Perera in quarters. Nimna Fernando had the better of Tarah Greig (7/5, 6/2) while Roshenka Fernando beat Savini Jayasuriya (7/6(4), 6/3) in the remaining two women’s singles quarters and will be seen in action at the semis.
