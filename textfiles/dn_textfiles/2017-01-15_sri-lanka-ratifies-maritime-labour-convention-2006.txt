Sri Lanka ratifies Maritime Labour Convention 2006

 
The government of Sri Lanka deposited the instrument of ratification of the Maritime Labour Convention, 2006 (MLC, 2006) with the International Labour Office last week, becoming the 81st ILO member state and the 16th Asian State to have ratified the Convention.
Sri Lanka’s Permanent Representative to the United Nations Ambassador Ravinatha Aryasinha who deposited the instrument of ratification said Sri Lanka looked forward to working closely with the ILO, for capacity building and training in labour standards and labour inspection.
ILO Director-General Guy Ryder said, “The ratification of Sri Lanka, located in a key position within the global liner shipping network, brings one more important player in the Asia Pacific region within the scope of the MLC, 2006.”
“Such ratification proves once more that the Convention has sparked a new dynamic, as countries now realize that the MLC 2006 unavoidably impacts on the manner in which they carry out maritime trade and that they have to align their laws and practice with the provisions of the Convention.”
“This ratification is all the more timely as it will allow Sri Lanka to improve labour conditions for its more than 22,000 seafarers and ensure that ships calling at its ports are inspected in compliance with the requirements of the Convention thereby promoting quality shipping and providing additional protection for seafarers transiting within its waters”.
The MLC 2006 entered into force on August 20, 2013 for the first 30 member States. The MLC 2006 will enter into force for Sri Lanka on January 12, 2018.
