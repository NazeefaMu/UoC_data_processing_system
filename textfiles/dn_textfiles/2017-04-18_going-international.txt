Going international

He has been there and done that in the glam and fashion industry for a long span. A well known face on the ramp Thilina Abishek boasts of six years in the modeling industry and a handful of accolades. A top ten finalist at Best Model of the World 2014, Sri Lanka, Thilina has also won the Mr Photogenic mini title at the event. He was among the top six finalists at Sirasa Manhunt 2015. This year he had two significant titles to his name: the mini title for Best Model at Ceylon Majestic Pageant and Mr Sri Lanka for Mister Top International Model of the World.
Tell us a bit about your family and background
I am a model by passion and a businessman by profession. I was born and raised in Kelaniya. I completed my higher studies at Sri Dharmaloka College, Kelaniya. My family includes my parents and my elder sister.
Why did you choose to get into the model and fashion industry?
I entered modeling because of my passion for the field. It makes me happy and feel good. People close to me said that I have the qualities such as good looks, facial projection, style etc that takes it to be a model. So I gave it my best shot and here I am today!
What does it take to win the Mister Sri Lanka for Top International Model of the World title?
It requires a well-balanced participant who is worthy of the title to win such a title. A top International model needs to have looks, discipline, personality, confidence, values, knowledge and experience. The top ranked models having reached the pinnacle of the industry has the ability to win such a title and represent the country on an international platform.
What are you looking forward to most when you fly to Bulgaria to take part in the Top International Model of the World competition?
A: I am looking forward for my experience in Bulgaria as a contestant on the pageant, as a representative from Sri Lanka and traveler in the new country. Exposure from an international pageant and experience at a global competition always brings self-development.
Compared with female models, male models do not have many opportunities in the field.
A: I disagree. Especially in the recent times, I believe industry veterans are giving equal opportunities to male and female models. But of course we need to understand that the need has to raise for any model to take on the opportunity, be it a female or a male model who is suitable for a fashion show, commercial etc.
Are you an outdoor person or an indoor person?
I am definitely more of an extrovert and outdoor person. I enjoy travelling, adventure activities and outdoor recreation such as camping, hiking and other such activities. Even in my everyday life, I enjoy the outdoors.
Besides modeling what are your other passions/talents?
In addition to modeling, I am passionate about fashion. I think both goes hand in glove. I watch out for new trends. Further its useful for my business which deals with female clothing and it is even useful for myself to make my mark as a fashionista.
What was your worst experience on the ramp?
I am fortunate to say my experience on the ramp has gone smooth and there hasn’t been such a worst experience during the past six years. (Smiles) I may have taken a wrong turn or something like that but nothing major or drastic! I haven’t had any bad experiences especially not during the recent times.
What kind of food do you like?
I like food that’s high in protein from almonds, smoked salmon, broccoli to protein chips. But sometimes my sweet tooth strikes and I end up eating chocolates, desserts, cheese cake, pol pani waffles and others. (Looks sheepish)
Three things you cannot do without.
(Laughing) My girlfriend/manager! Well, she’s not a thing though. (More laughter) The other two are my mobile and a mirror! (LOL)
What irritates you most?
The really warm weather irritates me. It also gets to me when people are dishonest.
What is the best modeling tip you have gotten and who gave it?
I have completed a modeling course at Zsaid Image’s Modeling Academy which was headed by Rozanne Dias and I have walked the runaway for top designers such as Michael Wijesuriya and choreographers like Lou Chin. So the tips, advice and guidance I have received during my journey as a model are numerous. One expert tip from Lou Chin for the runaway was ‘Your shoulders should stay still as you walk and they shouldn’t move much at all.’
What is your greatest contribution to the community?
Being generous and giving dana. I will contribute to the needy, animals and donate to religious places in anyway that’s possible for me on a regular basis.
If you become the winner of Top International Model of the World, what would you do?
Top International Model of the World is an international organization specialized in model pageants and the goal is to recognize the top/super model among its contestants participating from all around the world.
If I win a title from the pageant this year in Bulgaria, I would excel in my modeling journey, support young models in going forward, participate in events contributing to the country and try for the next best title.
How do you see your future from now?
In 5 to 10 years I will be happily married with children, a successful businessman with my own brand, a super model with international recognition and representing Sri Lanka whenever I am given opportunities.
What are you currently involved in and what is coming up?
My recent work was a few runaway fashion/bridal shows for industry veterans such as DhanajayaBandara, PremasiriHewawasam and Ramani Fernando. I also won the title of Mister Sri Lanka 2017. So currently I am taking some time off to prepare myself for the international pageant – Top International Model of the World in Bulgaria. However I accommodate modeling work as it comes and I will be shooting for a press campaign shortly.
