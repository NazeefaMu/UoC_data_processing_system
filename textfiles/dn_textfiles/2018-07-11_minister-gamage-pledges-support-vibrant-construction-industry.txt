Minister Gamage pledges support for vibrant construction industry

The government will keep on supporting the private sector to create a vibrant construction industry, said Minister of Social Welfare and Primary Industries Daya Gamage said.
Speaking further, Minister Gamage said plans have been made to obtain the services of retired engineers, local and from the Netherlands, to develop the island’s engineering field.
The Minister was speaking at the three-day INCO engineering exhibition at the BMICH in Colombo which was organized by Social Welfare and Primary Industries Ministry. The print media sponsor for the event was Lake House. Referring to urban development, he said Colombo would be modeled along the ‘global city’ concept and would act as South Asia’s hub for commerce and shipping.
He commended participants of the exhibition for having recognized the government thinking and designed the event to present a unique opportunity to local and foreign investors to identify the best manufacturers, suppliers and professionals in their respective industry segments. He said businesses would be given six per cent low interest loans under the Enterprise Sri Lanka programme.
He added that the World Bank assisted programme of his ministry has already started 85 enterprises, which would be increased to 500 before the year end. Deputy Minister Muthu Sivalingam and MP Dr. Thusitha Wijemanne also participated.
