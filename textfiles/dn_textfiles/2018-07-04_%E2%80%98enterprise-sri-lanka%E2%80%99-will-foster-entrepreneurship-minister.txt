‘Enterprise Sri Lanka’ will foster entrepreneurship: Minister

Entrepreneurship should be made the Engine of Growth in Sri Lanka and the Enterprise Sri Lanka programme will foster entrepreneurship found in the genes of Sri Lankans, Finance and Media Minister Mangala Samaraweera said.
The Minister addressing the gathering at the 175th anniversary celebrations at the Matara St. Thomas’ Boys School said the world was achieving such rapid progress today that technology might make accountants and drivers many become superfluous in the future. But today we were languishing with an examination pattern centred on the examination system.
Out of nearly 250,000 students sitting the Advanced Level examination only about 25,000 qualified to enter universities. Some others seek education abroad depending on their parents’ financial abilities.
The tradition today was to consider the rest of the students as incompetent. But the truth was otherwise. They could never be described as incompetent.
“We should confirm that this segment comprised competent people.Through the ‘Enterprise Sri Lanka’ programme, the government was trying to support the entrepreneurship of this segment. The government was granting loans for this purpose and the entire interest or part of it was borne by the government.
History proved that Sri Lankans had displayed skills and talents as efficient entrepreneurs rather than the agriculture industry. Archaeological excavations conducted in areas such as Anuradhapura and Polonnaruwa have unearthed coins belonging to foreign countries “Therefore our duty was to provide strength on behalf of the youth generation to develop entrepreneurship skills embedded in our genes.
“Our prime objective is to create 100,000 new entrepreneurs by 2020. The government has already taken steps to strengthen democracy and harmony needed for it”.
Samaraweera said what was required was to create development upon those strong pillars to make entrepreneurship the engine of growth.
