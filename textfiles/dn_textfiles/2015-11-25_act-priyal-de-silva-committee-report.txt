CAC urges Transport Minister
Act on Priyal de Silva Committee Report

The Coalition Against Corruption (CAC) urges Transport Minister Nimal Siripala de Silva to take prompt action against mega scale corruption revealed in the Priyal de Silva Committee Report. The Committee was appointed to inquire into financial misconduct of the Railways Department.
According to the Priyal De Silva Committee Report, a mega scale corruption running into millions of dollars had taken place in connection with the construction and renovation of rail tracks during the past regime, CVC convener Saman Rathnapriya said.
He was addressing the media yesterday in Colombo regarding the revelations in the Priyal de Silva Committee Report.
A committee under the chairmanship of Priyal de Silva was appointed by the government with to look into malpractices of rail track construction carried out by the Hycom Engineering Company, India. The tender to construct mainly three rail tracks - Colombo to Matara, Vavuniya to KKS and Medawachchiya to Talaimannar was granted to Hycom Engineering Company without following proper tender procedure. Accordingly, Hycom has constructed 256 kilometres of rail tracks at a cost of US $ 580.6 million.
The committee report revealed that the Hycom has charged US $ 2.2 million for constructing one kilometer of rail track. It is significant that Railways Department could construct the same rail track at a cost of US $ 0.4 million per kilometre, Rathnapriya said.
Even though such a huge amount has been spent for the construction, the Central Engineering Consultancy Bureau of Sri Lanka (CECB) has identified serious issues with the rail track constructions especially with the railway bridges. Therefore, the CECB has refused to certify those railway bridges due to several issues relating to quality, he added.
Rathnapriya said that more than 10,000 sleepers imported from India by Hycom were damaged within the first year of the construction. Moreover, another contract amounting to US $ 86 million was granted to the same company to establish the signalling system for 26 railway stations. After obtaining the tender, the Hycom has granted the construction to sub-contractors. Under this scheme another Indian company was sub contracted by Hycom to install signalling system for six stations at a cost of US$ 1.5 million.
“The alarming revelation by the Priyal de Silva Commission is, the entire signalling system is not brand new. It has been used,” he said. At this juncture, the Transport Ministry is seeking the cabinet approval to grant another approval to Hycom to import six Power Sets, 10 engines and renovate more rail tracks, he said.
