For your eyes only

I am driving along the Colombo-Hatton road, under a gray, April sky, in the company of a falsely exuberant radio announcer who breathlessly unfolds a long list of names of listeners, eagerly waiting for a certain song. The loving messages sent by, loving husbands and loving wives, loving aunts and loving uncles to each other through the announcer (why isn't it a better idea to whisper their message of love straight into the loved ones ear instead of broadcasting it into the ears of thousands of unwilling listeners) refuses to warm my heart, till finally the tunes of a familiar song drifts towards me...George Michael singing Careless Whispers. The music takes me back to my teenage-self, to the pages of my diary in which I had so zealously recorded how, one day I hoped to meet the idol of my dreams to help him put his broken heart back together again...Soon I am so wrapped up in my thoughts, the long forgotten past become more real than the gray present under a gray sky...
I remember my teenage daydreams so clearly because recently I have been reading my diaries of ten, twenty thirty years ago. From worries about the O/level Art paper to the first session of ragging I endured at Uni to that fateful day when I met a cousin of a friend who, to my horror had never read a book in his life, all I have to do is open an old diary to rewind my life... School. Uni. Loves. Devastations. Doubts. Adventures..they are all there, packed into a sheaf of handwritten pages.
Positive impacts
I didn't know it then, but it appears I have been doing the right thing. There is increasing evidence to support the notion that keeping a diary has a positive impact on physical well-being. University of Texas at Austin psychologist and researcher James Pennebaker contends that regular journaling strengthens immune cells, called T-lymphocytes. Other research indicates that journaling decreases the symptoms of asthma and rheumatoid arthritis.
Not surprisingly, journaling (or keeping letters or diaries) is an ancient tradition, one that dates back to at least the 10th century. Successful people throughout history have kept journals. Presidents have maintained them for posterity; writers for inspiration. For some like Oscar Wilde it was a source of entertainment.
"I never travel without my diary. One should always have something sensational to read on the train," said Wilde. True, neither Winston Churchill nor Barack Obama would have recorded their brushes with love or musings on listener's request pro grammes on the radio, but if they did, it would have been okay.
After all, that's the beauty of keeping a journal: there is no wrong way to do it. And you are the only one who is going to read it, anyway. Perhaps over and over some day in the future, perhaps, never.
Empty chair technique
Just ask Freud - bottling up emotions and feelings is bad for you, and one of the best ways to treat numerous psychological conditions is to just let them out so that you can deal with them and move on. Techniques recommended by psychologists often include things like the 'empty chair' technique where you imagine a chair has someone on it and then tell them your problems/how you feel about them.
By using a diary or a journal you will be able to do this yourself on a regular basis and thus ensure that you are not bottling things up which might ultimately come out in damaging ways. This allows you to start each day feeling refreshed and energetic with no psychic garbage left over from the day before
I know what you are thinking: "So writing a few sentences a day may keep me healthier longer, but so will eating red rice and spinach! Why should I bother journaling when I have already got too much on my plate?" Hold it. Don't abandon hope all ye. Here's why:
Scientific evidence supports that journaling provides many unexpected benefits. The act of writing accesses your left brain, which is analytical and rational.
While your left brain is occupied, your right brain is free to create, intuit and feel. In sum, writing removes mental blocks and allows you to use all of your brainpower to better understand yourself, others and the world around you.
If you have always thought, journals are places for wired people to record their deepest, darkest confessions or reveal the most vulnerable parts of their inner selves, think again.
In reality, journals are simply receptacles for to-do-lists, future goals, spur-of-the-moment ideas, and random insights that you want to remember later. By writing down this kind of information, you will be able to better order your life and hold yourself accountable even when you are at your busiest.
Pacifying the monkey mind
Journals can also be vessels for celebratory accounts, as they can remind you of past achievements and milestones. If you are feeling low, you can easily boost your self-esteem and paint a picture of your own awesomeness by paging through your accomplishments and moments of greatness.
Keeping a diary will make your mind, quieter, too, because offloading your racing thoughts onto a nonjudgmental medium that isn't attached to punishment will allow you to get off the rat-race and onto a more mentally healthy track. Countless medical professionals and institutions have endorsed journaling as a method to pacify the monkey mind. That is, as a way of managing overwhelming emotions and reduce anxiety and stress.
And, as you do so, you will end up getting to know yourself more. This is because journals can also act as profound pools of personal reflection. Taking time to shut out the loudness of the outside world and reconnect with your thoughts can lead to incredible self-discovery. The process of pouring out your unadulterated ideas onto a blank page may very well reveal some diamonds in the rough that would otherwise have been swept out the door with the ordinary dust of the filtered mind. Finally, by continually journaling, you give yourself the privilege of tracking your own evolution and the power to acknowledge how you have changed and grown.
More conquerable
Moreover, while journaling may inadvertently help you find solutions to troubling problems, one of the more important functions it serves is granting you the ability to gain perspective on your thoughts and feelings. So rather than fixing emotional challenges straightaway, writing about them simply changes your relationship with these life hurdles, which can make them more conquerable in the long run.
Plus, you will also lose weight. Not literally (sorry if I got your hopes up), but you will feel lighter. Journals have long been touted as platforms of cathartic release, and as social psychologist James Pennebaker has proven, writing expressively about traumatic events or situations can uplift both your mind and body.
So, if you want to have any idea about the life you are living right now, keep a diary. If not, when the days of your life are gone from you, who will give them back? Who will tell you your own stories? Who will add colour back into your life when all you are left with is black and gray?
If you are not doing it already, start journaling right now. And, if at first, you can't think of what to write, do what Ernest Hemingway did. "I would stand and look out over the roofs of Paris and think, 'Do not worry.
You have always written before and you will write now. All you have to do is write one true sentence that you know.' So finally I would write one true sentence, and then go on from there. It was easy then because there was always one true sentence that I knew or had seen or had heard someone say."
Here are five reasons why you should keep a journal:
1. Your journal has the potential to be both therapist and a dear friend who listens without judging or interrupting and is open 24 hours a day. You can tell your journal things you wouldn't dare verbalise to someone else. Writing it down takes the edge off more toxic feelings and emotions and helps you better understand what you are feeling, freeing up thinking space to gain clarity on what to do next.
2. By getting into the habit of consciously and attentively looking back over your journals, you are able to track your personal patterns of behaviour that help you achieve goals and respond effectively to challenges. You are also able to see the patterns that get in the way of personal and professional growth, and healthy relationships with self and others. By becoming mindful with what you are discovering, you can move yourself from knowing into a doing state.
3. Journaling is inexpensive, accessible and is easily self-managed. It carries very few side effects and can be applied almost anywhere.
4. Journals are creative portals. Because you are in dialogue with your inner life when you write in a journal, you solve problems and get creative. Keeping a journal can be both a clearing-house and become an incubator where you tap into your imagination and unleash your creativity and ideas. Writers like Virginia Woolf, Maya Angelou, Ralph Waldo Emerson, Henry David Thoreau, Sylvia Path and Alice Walker along with hundreds of writers across time who all kept diaries and journals which has informed their writing and creative productivity.
5. You give yourself permission to write yourself into history
Journals give voice to your dreams and aspirations but are also safe spaces to release negative feelings, hurts and disappointments that could get in the way of those dreams and aspirations being realised.
