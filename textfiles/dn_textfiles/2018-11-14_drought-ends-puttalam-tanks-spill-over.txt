Drought ends in Puttalam, tanks spill over....

The Moonamalgaswewa Tank has begun to spill with the heavy rains after over two and half years of drought experienced in the Karuwalagaswewa Divisional Secretariat division. Over 260 acres of paddy lands which could not be cultivated during previous seasons are ready to be cultivated due to the rains. Children taking a dip at the tank spill after a long time.
