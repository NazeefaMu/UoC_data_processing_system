Corruption case against Abeygunawardena: Trial fixed for May 28

Colombo High Court Judge Sampath Wijeratne yesterday, fixed for May 28, recording further evidence in a corruption case filed against former Minister and Kalutara District Parliamentarian Rohitha Abeygunawardena for the alleged unlawful acquisition of assets estimated at Rs. 41.1 million.
When the case came up before High Court Judge Sampath Wijeratne, an officer attached to the Ratmalana electric engineering office gave evidence and a further trial was fixed for May 28.
On an earlier occasion, the High Court overruled preliminary objections raised by the former Minister against the Bribery Commission's decision to amend the charges and decided to proceed with the trial.
The Director General of the Commission to Investigate Allegations of Bribery or Corruption had filed an indictment in the Colombo High Court on two counts against former Minister Rohitha Abeygunawardena for the unlawful acquisition of assets estimated at Rs. 41.1 million.
In his indictment, the Director General of the Bribery Commission alleged that the former Minister had committed this offence by way of undeclared assets between 2004 to 2006. The Director General alleged that the former Minister had unlawfully made 66 monitory transactions, constructed a house and purchased a jeep in contravention of Section 23(a) of the Bribery Act.
The Director General further alleged that former Minister Abeygunawardena had owned these properties-deems under the provision of the Act to be property acquired through bribery.
