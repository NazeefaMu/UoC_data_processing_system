Marshall Investments launches hardware range

Marshall Investments (Pvt) Ltd., a joint venture company with a knowledge of the construction sector, recently launched a range of high quality, high strength CRC steel based hardware to cater to the requirements of the upper middle-class market in the construction sector in Sri Lanka.
The new Marshall range was introduced following research into world trends in the builders sector where in most developed countries the usage of brass hinges and latches is fading out and is being replaced by aluminium, high quality steel and stainless steel products.
The key figures promoting this joint venture are J.D. Peiris of Lanka Aluminium Industries PLC Group and S. Madanayake of ACL Cables PLC who have a wealth of knowledge and experience in the builder’s market and construction sector.
Prior to the introduction of this range to the mass and upper middle class construction sector, the affordable builder’s market segment in Sri Lanka had very little choice in terms of selecting suitable products for their requirements. Their very few choices included low quality brass products, steel items prone to rust especially in coastal areas.
