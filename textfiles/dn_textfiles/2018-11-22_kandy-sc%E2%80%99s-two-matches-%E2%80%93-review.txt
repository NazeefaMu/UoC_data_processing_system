Kandy SC’s two matches – a review

Kandy, the defending champions extended their winning performance in their first two games of the new Dialog rugby league against Air Force SC and Police SC to keep their unbeaten record intact carried forward from the previous year.
Kandy SC has a well-balanced side and coached by Sean Wijesinghe and Fazil Marija past captains of the club. However the rugby that was put on show in the last two games was not all that convincing even though they won. If they continue to play in this fashion, it is going to be hard for them to retain the cup this season. They are expected to give a better display in their third game against Army SC on Saturday at Ratmalana.
Kandy SC forwards are knowledgeable and good thinkers of the game when compared to the other teams, they are fast on their feet and good in both defence and attack. The halves combination should make use of the good possession their forwards win for them and run and feed their fast three-quarters to score tries as they did last season. They have a huge potential and capable of giving their best, but some “hoodoo” seems to be prevailing on their good run and pass rugby. It is time they settled down to play some solid rugby to recapture the past glory.
In the first game, against Air Force SC at Ratmalana, though they won 28 points to 19 , the rugby on display that afternoon was very disappointing as they provided some mediocre rugby. Kandy didn’t have to wait too long for points, in the 30th second they scored their first points. From here the opponents were very impressive and gave the Kandy SC a good fight, the Airmen indulged in some good rugby and were running the ball at random to the viewing pleasure of their supporters. Kandy S.C. players shone well in patches and earned the points through tries from Vishvamithra Jayasinghe, Roshan Weeraratna and Richard Dharmapala who scored twice and four conversions by Thilina Wijesinghe
In the second game against Police SC last Saturday at Nittawela Kandy had to produce a hard fought performance to outwit their opponents by 32 points to 23. It was a superb performance by the cops who offered some exciting moments of overturning Kandy. It became a tough game from the first whistle. The Police forwards defence was excellent , that helped them to dominate forward play on and off.
In this game at their home den, much was expected from Kandy but they failed to deliver, they got some good possessions, but due to unforeseen errors it turned out to be a grim day for them. They seemed to be little frustrated as they couldn’t penetrate their opponents territory, but at the same time they were really proud of the way they hung in and won the game.
The points scorers for Kandy were , three from Danushka Ranjan and one from Yakoob Ali and the goal kicking part was off he boot of Thilina Wijesinghe and Arshad Jamaldeen.
The present table standing 1) Kandy SC 12 points, (2) Havelock SC 11 points, (3) CR & FC 10 points , (4) Army SC 6 points, (5), Navy SC 6 points (6) CH & FC 2 points, (7) Police SC 1 point.
