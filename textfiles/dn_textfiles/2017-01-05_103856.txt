Guidelines to run hospital canteens

The Health Ministry issued instructions to Provincial Health Directors, Regional Health Directors and the other authorities to run hospital canteens in a healthy manner, Health Ministry sources said.
According to the sources, hospital canteens should provide drinking water to customers free of charge and ensure food safety in keeping with the provisions of the food Act Number 26 of 1980. They should promote healthy food and restrict selling junk food.
The food stored in refrigerators should be kept under required temperature.
According to the instructions, hygiene of food, the instruments used, the staff serving food and the clean environment of the canteen should be ensured.
Special attention should be paid not to sell food with excessive sugar, salt and fat, the sources said. The responsibility of running a healthy canteen at hospitals is with the hospital authorities.
They should submit an annual technical report to the Head of the Non Communicable Disease Unit of the Health Ministry on observations and remedies, the sources added.
