Trial commences against former DLB Chairman

The Colombo Chief Magistrate yesterday commenced the trial against former Development Lottery Board (DLB) Chairman Dr. Chandrawansa Pathiraja for allegedly causing a sum of Rs.23 million unlawful loss to the DLB when awarding promotional activities pertaining to several lottery tickets to three private companies contrary to the accepted tender procedure.
When the cases came up before Chief Magistrate Lal Ranasinghe Bandara, defence counsel Kalinga Indatissa PC appearing for the accused raised objections regarding the prosecution’s attempt to amend the charge sheets during the trial. The Chief Magistrate directed both parties to file their written submissions regarding defence objections on August 3.
The Commission to Investigate Allegations of Bribery or Corruption had filed this case against former DLB chairman under Section 70 of the Bribery Act.
The Commission further alleged that the former Chairman had awarded promotional activities to the private companies between November 2014 and December 2014 in violation of the law.
