Edible gold pizza

Pizza has long been regarded as the food of the people; It’s cheap, easy to make and tastes amazing. But that doesn’t apply to all pizzas. For example, a restaurant in New York City serves a pizza that only the 1 percent can afford. It’s priced at $2,000 and comes covered in strips of edible 24K gold.
The Industry Kitchen restaurant in New York’s South Street Seaport was inspired by the nearby Financial District, which attracts the wealthy from all over the world, to create the “epitome of decadence” pizza. It’s officially called ‘the fance’za’, but epitome of decadence sounds much more appropriate. This outrageously expensive treat consists of a black pie made with squid ink, Stilton cheese imported from England, Foie Gras and truffles from France, Ossetra caviar harvested from the Caspian Sea, edible flowers, and lost of edible 24K gold strips and flakes from Ecuador.
“The pizza is extremely rich—if you’re in the mood for a lavish meal, this is the pizza for you,” Executive Chef Braulio Bunay says. It’s also one of the most expensive foods money can buy, but apparently preparing it in the “form of a pizza makes it more approachable.”
“The people get in shock because they never see in one dish all these special ingredients” Braulio told Insider. “It’s very expensive and it’s delicious” At $2,000 a pie – that’s $250 a slice and around $50 a bite – it damn well better be delicious.
If you can actually afford to spend this much dough (pun intended) on a pizza, you should know that Industry Kitchen requires patrons to order it 48 hours in advance.
