Step-motherly treatment to injured STF men from govt. doctors

Special Task Force Commandant DIG M.R.Latheef yesterday told the Daily News that the STF personnel who were injured during the clash with university students at the Health Ministry premises were diverted to the Police hospital as doctors at the National Hospital did not offer them proper treatment.
He said that five STF personnel were transferred to the Police Hospital on Wednesday night after they received reports that these injured STF personnel did not receive proper treatment.
When Latheef was asked whether doctors at the Police Hospital too had joined the token strike launched by the Government Medical Officers Association, he said that doctors at the Police hospital abide by the regulations of the Police Department.
“They won’t joint the strike action launched by the GMOA”, he said
Nearly 70 students injured in clashes with the Police on Wednesday’s anti SAITM demonstration are reported to be still receiving treatment at the Colombo National Hospital.
However, Director of National Hospital Dr Anil Jasinghe said such an incident had not been reported to him.
Meanwhile police have launched a full scale investigations under the direct supervision of Colombo DIG Lalith Pathinayake regarding the forcible entry made into the Health Ministry premises and causing damage to state property including vehicles during the protest campaign against SAITM on Wednesday , Police headquarters said in a press release.
“Investigators have already made arrangements to obtain a valuation report on the property damage and take legal action against those responsible for causing the damage, by utilizing video clips from CCTV cameras and other evidence, the release added.
