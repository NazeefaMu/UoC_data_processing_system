The surgical dressings are very essential in the health care sector. Sri Lanka can save vast amounts of foreign exchange yearly by developing this industry. The heavy import duties on these products , is a protection given by the government for this industry.

But unfortunately low quality products are coming to the market. We believe that it is the duty of implementing authorities to be responsible for same,” Pelpola said.
