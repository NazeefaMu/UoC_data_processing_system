Dengue threatens Ampara

Coastal residents in the Ampara district said monsoon rains resulted in increasing mosquito breeding grounds in the area.
Several dengue patients were identified in the coastal areas and if preventive measures are not taken on time, another outbreak of dengue is imminent, they warned.
Health officials warned residents against dengue and asked them to eradicate dengue mosquito breeding grounds by maintaining their gardens, workplaces, and residents clean and tidy.
Garbage dumps in the areas worsens the situation. Those who dump wastage recklessly will be dealt with legally in order to control the disease, authorities said.
Low lying coastal areas were inundated turning them to ideal breading grounds for dengue mosquitoes, residents said.
The drainage system in the areas were blocked, they complained. Many dengue eradication programmes were in progress in the district, health officials said.
