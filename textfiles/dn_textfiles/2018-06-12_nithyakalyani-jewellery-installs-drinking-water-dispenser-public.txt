Nithyakalyani Jewellery installs drinking water dispenser for public

Wellawatte Nithyakalyani Jewellery, a pioneer in the gem and jewellery trade in Sri Lanka, celebrated its 40th anniversary recently.
The company which began its journey in 1978 has been in the forefront over the last 40 years and is a leading exporter of jewellery in Sri Lanka. Nithyakalyani Jewellery which launched a series of social service programs this year to mark its 40-year celebrations installed a drinking water dispenser for the general public in close proximity to their showroom in Wellawatte. The aim of installing the dispenser along Galle road was to assist the general public who travel daily to quench their thirst. This brings back memories of the ‘Pin Thaliya’ which exists in villages.
The ‘Pin Thaliya’ was a large bowl or cauldron of water, kept along the road to help villagers quench their thirst.

As it has embarked on its journey beyond 40 years, Wellawatte Nithyakalyani Jewellery remains synonymous with trusted service.
