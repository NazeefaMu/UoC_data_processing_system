Face confident Pakistan in second ODI today : Sri Lanka has worst ODI record with unsettled batting order

ABU DHABI, Sunday: Sri Lanka already with the worst win-loss ratio record for a Test nation in a calendar year has a tough task ahead of them to break the winless run of eight consecutive defeats when they take on Champions Trophy champions Pakistan in the second ODI at the Sheikh Zayed Stadium here on Monday.
Sri Lanka’s defeat at the hands of Pakistan in the first ODI played at Dubai on Friday has stretched their losses for the calendar year to 17 out of 22 matches and given them a win-loss ratio of 0.235 which according to Cricinfo stats is the worst by any Test team.
None of the top Test nations have had such a poor record, in terms of win-loss ratio in any calendar year in which they have played 20 or more ODIs, the previous worst was West Indies with 0.266 (won 4, lost 15) in 2009.
Sri Lanka’s worst year before this was in 1999, when they won 12 and lost 20.
Amongst Sri Lanka’s worst defeats this year are a shocking 3-2 series loss to Zimbabwe and a drawn series against Bangladesh both at home and 5-0 drubbings at the hands of South Africa and India.
Sri Lanka’s troubles as pointed out by head coach Nic Pothas is in their top order batting which has not delivered the required runs as expected with the top six batters contributing just 96 runs with one of them going onto score 53 in the first ODI at Dubai which they lost by 83 runs.
“The last few seasons this has happened. We need big knocks and if you need big totals someone has to go onto post a big total. Babar Azam got a hundred for Pakistan and they got close to 300. In ODIs, one batsman needs to score big and that is the only way forward to post decent totals,” said Sri Lanka skipper Upul Tharanga.
“Since 2016 we have not played well. We have not been consistent. A lot of things changed. Players were changed and we had injuries. But still I don’t think we played to our potential. We play one game well and then we fail to live upto expectations. We beat India in England in June but since then we have struggled due to lack of consistency,” he said.
Various issues have prevented Sri Lanka from having a set batting order since the departure of their two batting legends Kumar Sangakkara and Mahela Jayawardene (who held onto the no. 3 and 4 positions for years). For instance when Niroshan Dickwella and Danushka Gunathilaka were beginning to pair off well together as openers from the Champions Trophy the latter got hauled up on disciplinary grounds and was banned for six one-day games, thus breaking the opening partnership that was beginning to build. That forced the team management and selectors to opt for skipper Upul Tharanga who had been batting in the middle order to promote himself as Dickwella’s partner.
Also the no. 3 and 4 positions are not settled yet with various players being tried out at different times.
Mendis has occupied the no. 3 slot since the South African series from the beginning of the year until he was rested for the final match of the Indian series and Dilshan Munaweera given that slot. On Friday Mendis on his return was pushed to bat at no. 5 against Pakistan - a position regularly occupied by Dinesh Chandimal who was surprisingly sent ahead of Mendis at no. 3.
Tharanga has occupied the no. 4 spot since the Zimbabwe series and moved as opener in Sri Lanka’s last two ODIs against India and Pakistan. These few examples of players being moved around as if in a game of musical chairs has certainly not helped Sri Lanka’s batting woes. In their last seven ODIs their highest total has been 238 which is hardly a total to be in today’s context when teams are running up scores in excess of 300.
Defending the move to send Chandimal ahead of Mendis, Tharanga said, “Chandimal came to bat at three. He had a very good Test series. Mendis was not amongst the runs. What we wanted was since Chandi was in good nick to give him a go. We wanted Kusal to go at five and gain some confidence. That didn’t work for us. Apart from two or three players others are in their right positions. We need to give one player a long run in one position.”
“This series when it started we spoke about batting because it has let us down over the last few series. We tried to tell the players what their role is. All the players are aware of their roles. I hope from tomorrow onwards we will come up with good batting efforts,” he said. Pakistan with no such issues in their camp are a confident lot and looking forward to winning the series if the way they played in the first ODI is to be used as a paradigm to the form they are in.
“There are a few things to address. We missed a few things. The first ten overs we didn’t take singles so it’s important to address that but otherwise the team’s overall performance was good,” said Pakistan captain Sarfraz Ahmed.
“Thanks to God we did well in the first ODI. We played well and the team gave an overall performance, so the expectations are high for an important second game. We have done good preparations so it’s an important match. We will do our best to take it one by one and win the next. Our team will be the same,” he said.
