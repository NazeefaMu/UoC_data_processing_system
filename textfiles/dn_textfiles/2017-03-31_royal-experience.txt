A Royal experience!

The Royal College English Drama Society is a fine blend of past pupils and present day Royalists. It is mix of knowledge, experience, wisdom and talent. Dramatic Moves features the Royal College English Drama society where past and present join hands.
Teacher in Charge, Mrs. Lanka Ranatunga pointed out that one of their strengths definitely is the fact that the old boys are very much involved.
“This is one of our strengths. They assist us with the funding, so there is no burden for the school. It is a vast collaboration with the old boys, present day thespians and prefects. So many people are involved in this,” said Ranatunga.
Ranatunga also added that the school has received a lot of acclaim. “When it comes to drama we have a very high rating. These students are a very dedicated set. Once they start practicing they are very committed to it. We normally have practices during the late evenings. There is the parental support and the support of the old boys,” pointed out Ranatunga.
Ranatunga also stressed that Drama builds up team work and inculcates leadership qualities in the student. “It helps immensely for studies as well. The students also receive training how to work with the team and address an audience. It develops their personalities and creates an all -round personality,” she explained.
Capable!
President and Chairman Vinsara Jayalath also agreed that one of their main strengths is that the old boys help them.
“They understand our capabilities as a school and they know this through experience having done drama themselves. The whole cast has one objective and one understanding and we all strive towards that, so we excel when it comes to team work,” said Jayalath.
When it comes to drama the school has a good foundation in their inter-house drama competitions. Also they are a very resilient group of thespians.
“Last year one of the main achievements was bringing the inter-house drama competition on a grand scale. The children themselves made and wrote their plays and took part. ‘Around the World in 80 days’, really was a mass production. And it was really funny and from that we did a tragedy like Julius Caesar at the Shakespeare Drama Competition and came up runners up that year,” explained Jayalath.
Positive atmosphere!
Cast leader Suran Weerasekara felt that one of their strengths is that they have a lot of diversity.
“Even off the stage they have very differently personalities and different qualities. So when it comes to acting it translates pretty well. The diversity of the people helps portray different roles. So you learn a lot from each other and as an experience for the actors themselves, it is something really great. That is something special I see in the Royal Cast,” said Weerasekara.
The Old Royalists Association of Dramatists are aiding these thespians in terms of finances and organizing workshops. “With that kind of background, there is a very positive atmosphere in the school itself and it will help us reach great heights,” stated Weerasekara
The Shakepeare drama competition is very competitive and it is a great honor to emerge winners.
“However this in a way has detracted from Drama itself. So many schools focus so much of their attention on the Shakespeare Drama competition alone, which is important and a great achievement. But something that we have been trying over the last few years, is not to let that competition take away from every other aspect of drama. Shakespeare is one style of drama. There are so many other varieties. It would be a bad move to isolate drama into Shakespeare alone. You can do public production workshops and collaborations with other schools. While the Shakespeare competition is important and while that competition brings out a different set of qualities, we should not forget these other aspects,” explained Weerasekara.
Weerasekara pointed out that when it comes to drama, the handling of the logistics can be very demanding.
“Our practices start at 4pm – 5pm. It often goes on until 1.30am, the next morning. Sustaining that kind of practice on a daily basis for a couple of months is really exhausting. Throughout the period of a year doing two or three productions is extremely draining. And sometimes with all the studies, it is not fair to expect so much of the students,” added Weerasekara
Weerasekera reasoned that maybe schools can reach out to a more diverse and larger set of people to take part in drama with the added benefit being that it will develop more people and it will make it easier for the others who have to apply themselves to such a strenuous routine.
“Perhaps a good way to start this, is to promote drama at a very young age. Communication skills, language skills and dramatic skills can be acquired at a very young age. At that age it is so much easier to grasp this,” informed Weerasekara.
The boys as a whole maintained that one unique feature of their cast is, that as opposed to having certain spectacular individuals who would carry the entire play and steal the show, their main strength is that the entire cast works together and each person contributes to making the entire performance something amazing. In 2013, when they did ‘Tempest’ at Shakespeare, there was no stand out character. When they did Julius Caesar last year and came runners up, it was a similar performance.
Winning the Shakespeare is a great motivational factor
Secretary Madara Thalduwa, maintained that the parents’ consent goes along way.
“Drama at college really matters a lot to us. So our parents have been a great help and that is another strength. Winning the Shakespeare is a great motivational factor for us. For me doing drama is a life changing experience. It improves all the aesthetic aspects of your life. It may be script writing and even directing skills.
Not so easy!
Treasurer Haathim Munas believes that where there is a will there is a way.
“Balancing school work and practices can be a challenge. But when you want to do something for the school and you want to get the cup, you will do anything. You will do your studies in the morning and practise in the evening. And then next morning you go for classes. It is not easy and during those two or three months you do your best with or without sleep because you know it is important,” said Munas
Lifetime bonds!
Nipun Kannangara felt that one of the great benefits is getting to know people. And that is a great experience. “It is something you miss out on, if you don’t do it. It is something you will regret not doing.”
Yashanka De Soyza and Kalinda Abeyanayake shared the same opinion that the best experiences are the bonds you form and that is a really a great experience.
