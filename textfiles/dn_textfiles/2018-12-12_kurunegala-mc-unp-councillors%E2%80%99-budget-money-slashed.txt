Kurunegala MC UNP councillors’ budget money slashed

Kurunegala MC Opposition Leader Wijayananda Wedisinghe (UNP) told the media recently that the UNP authorities prevented UNP MC members from participating in the 2019 budget debate. He said the UNP councilors, therefore, boycotted the debate and as a result, the mayor has cut off their budget allocations.
“This is a very serious loss. Each UNP councilor was to receive Rs. 1 million for the next year,” he said. Kurunegala Former Mayor Gamini Peramune said this is the first time that the opposition councilors boycotted a budget debate. “We all should work for the people of Kurunegala and the councillors must understand their duty towards the public,” he said. – SMW
