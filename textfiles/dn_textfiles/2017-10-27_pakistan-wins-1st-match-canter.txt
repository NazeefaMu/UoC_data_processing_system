Lanka’s wretched batting form continues into the T20s
Pakistan wins 1st match in a canter

Thursday: Sri Lanka’s wretched run in one-day cricket continued when they were outplayed by Pakistan by seven wickets in the first T20 International played at the Sheikh Zayed Stadium here on Thursday.
Invited to bat first Sri Lanka came up against a varied Pakistan bowling attack and were put out for a disappointing 102 in 18.3 overs once again failing to go the distance as they had in the fifty-over one-dayers.
Pakistan knocked the runs in 17.2 overs losing three wickets to canter home with 16 balls to spare.
Ahmed Shehzad (22) and Shoaib Malik (42 not out off 31 balls) put together the highest partnership of the match 46 for the third wicket to see Pakistan home after Sri Lanka had captured two early wickets for 18. Mohammad Hafeez made 25 not out.
A lot was expected of this Sri Lanka side under a new captain Thisara Perera after several players pulled out of the team not wanting to go to Lahore, but the same problems seemed to persist despite the changes.
The rate at which the Sri Lankan batsmen got out was even too rapid for the electronic scoreboard to keep pace with. Before the board could complete putting up the new batsman’s name he was already making his way back to the pavilion. Such was the dismal display of batting that the Lankans put up.
One has to give credit to Pakistan’s bowling line up which had enough variations up its sleeve to cause discomfort to the batsmen. Mohammad Hafeez in his first over broke the back of the batting with a double strike sending back Mahela Udawatte and Dasun Shanaka in one over that was also a maiden.
Hasan Ali was once more the tormentor of the Lankan batting with three wickets for 23, but one has to give credit to the rest of the bowling for their ruthlessness and unrelenting approach, something which we have not seen from past Pakistan sides.
Sri Lanka needed a good launch pad if they were to be competitive, but they lost Dilshan Munaweera off the third ball of the innings for a duck and although Danushka Gunathilaka and Sadeera Samarawickrama raised the total to 29 and Sri Lanka reached 51-2 in the ninth over, the batting failed to gain momentum and they lost the remaining eight wickets while the score was doubled.
Samarawickrama and Seekkuge Prasanna who hit a couple of lusty blows for sixes towards the end top scored with 23 apiece, but the rest of the batting was disappointing.
Sri Lanka will have to seriously think about their batting order because such big hitters like Perera, Shanaka and Prasanna should be sent up the order instead of adopting a conventional approach that proved rather detrimental to the batting in its overall context.
The second match of the three-match series will be played at the same venue today.
