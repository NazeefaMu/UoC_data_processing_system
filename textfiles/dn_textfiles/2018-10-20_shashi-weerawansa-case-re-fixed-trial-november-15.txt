Shashi Weerawansa case  re-fixed for trial on November 15

Two cases filed against Shashi Weerawansa, wife of National Freedom Front (NFF) Leader Wimal Weerawansa over an incident where Shashi Weerawansa had fraudulently obtained two passports including a diplomatic passport by submitting forged documents to the Department of Immigration and Emigration, were yesterday re-fixed for trial on November 15, by Colombo Chief Magistrate Ranga Dissanayake.
Attorney-at-Law Buddhika Mallawaarachchi appearing on behalf of Shashi Weerawansa, sought another date for trial since Senior Defence Counsel Anil Silva PC, was not present in Court.
The Defence Counsel informed Court that his client would not be able to appear before the Court Registrar next Friday (26), owing to an alms giving ceremony at her residence.
Deputy Solicitor General Dileepa Peiris stated that it is inappropriate for an accused being appearing before the Court’s Registrar. At a previous occasion too, the preceding Magistrate had ordered the accused to appear before the CID every last Sunday of each month. Later on, this order had been changed, enabling the accused to appear before the Court’s Registrar, DSG Peiris added.
Shashi Weerawansa was arrested on February 2015, over the charge of obtaining diplomatic and general passports illegally. She had allegedly submitted a birth certificate with forged names and dates of birth in obtaining the passports. She is currently out on bail.
