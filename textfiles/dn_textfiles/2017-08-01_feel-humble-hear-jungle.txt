Feel humble, hear the jungle

As the beam of autumn strikes China, this garden will attract a magnificent influx of tourists both Chinese and foreign.
For Sri Lankans, this garden with its interesting as well as the questionable name, it will hark them back to Brief Garden
(which belonged to Bevis Bawa, brother of Geoffrey Bawa).
What is the destiny of politicians and administrators when they are caught red-handed for corruption and administrative failure? They would carefully close the door behind them, and let the public forget that much clichéd phrase. In this land, politicians have never been heard of being humbled nor forced to eating the idiomatic pie. And so it is that both ‘humble’ and ‘administrator’ run only parallel tracks never to converge into one path.
In Wang Xiancheng, however, we hear a different tale.
Following his appointment as an Imperial Envoy, Xiancheng had to tread a rough terrain. His career, though illustrious, was full of demotions as well as promotions. In the end, he had to call it a day as a result of being accused of corruption. Luckily he planned his retirement while still being an administrator. He chose a marshy land with a Taoist temple on it to create his garden in 1513. He left the door open to his painter friend, Zhengming to syringe an artistic touch to the garden.
Xiancheng’s classical reading inspired him to name the garden accordingly. He was enamoured by Pan Yue’s lines in ‘An Idle Life’: I enjoy a carefree life by planting trees and building my own house...I irrigate my garden and grow vegetables for me to eat...such a life suits a retired official like me well.
That points us to the inner creature in Wang Xiancheng and his passion for living a humbled life without caring much about the bureaucratic lifestyle. And the name of the garden arrived at Xiancheng’s doorstep: The Humble Administrator’s Garden.
For those familiar with Vikram Seth, this is no poetry collection. Yet, as you step into this landscape, you will hear the poetry of jungle from all corners. It is simply a miracle to witness the work of one man who lived only a few centuries ago. And that offers us a sweet reminder: administrators can ‘afford’ to be humble too.
As the beam of autumn strikes China, this garden will attract a magnificent influx of tourists both Chinese and foreign.

The garden’s name is interesting because of the over-pervading peacefulness. And the name is open to question with its acreage of 13, and being the largest garden in Suzhou. The 13-acre garden should be more than a humble man’s work. But it can essentially be a work of an administrator.
Despite huge crowds thronging on a Saturday, peacefulness exists quite much in the garden. The Chinese guide, John, enlightened a South Asian delegation how everything in this garden is designed according to the feng shui.
The beauty of the season is very much present in this area. Although windy and chilly, you will really enjoy being here. After 4 pm, the atmosphere gets a bit cooler.
The walkers in the garden have three parts to explore. First, it is the central part known as Zhuozheng Yuan. Second, the eastern part once called Guitianyuanju (Dwelling Upon Return to the Countryside). And third, a western part formally is known as the Supplementary Garden. The structures are grouped around a labyrinthine lake, rather like a Chinese water village. The Hall of Distant Fragrance is on the south shore of the lake and looks to an island with the Pavilion of Fragrant Snow.
Although the garden was much simpler in the past, today, it is home to a variety of pavilions and trees.
Like in any generation, Wang’s next generation lost the control of this lovely estate. Drowned in gambling debts, his son had to disown the garden which was to be followed by many owners afterwards.
The Humble Administrator’s Garden continues to charm a huge gathering with its exclusive designs, delicate beauty and the serene atmosphere. That could probably be one of the foremost reasons why the UNESCO has declared the garden as a World Heritage Site.
The visitors enter a lost estate with its numerous pavilions, bridges, pathways, ponds and small forest areas. The pavilions await the romance with many couples – whether they are long-time married, newly-married, about-to-get married or budding relationships – occupying for a short while. The bridges are the raised platform upon which you can see afar and capture yourself on a selfie against the iridescent skies. The pathways are ready to welcome you to feel calmer with a soft meditative walk. Take a little break by the ponds and listen to the consistent hiss of mini waterfalls. And breathe in the silence reigning on the small forest areas.
Once you enter this garden, everything seems to move as though in a dream. Walk on, without a hurry, and fill your soul with this song of the jungle.
