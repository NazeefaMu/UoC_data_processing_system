Cinema veterans get together

A get together to discuss about the prevailing situation of the film industry was held recently. The event was organized by the Sri Lanka Cinema Directors Society led by its president Bennett Ratnayake, secretary Udayakantha Warnasooriya and treasurer Saman Weeraman. The main focus of the meeting was the issues which are related to distributing a film after production. The group was able to find answers to some of the problems which were brought up during the discussions.
