Lalith Priyankara pays homage to fathers

Veteran lyricist and media personality Lalith Priyankara’s latest research work titled as Piyek Pudanu Siyak Geetha will be launched at Sahitha Poth Piyasa (717/1, Maradana Road, Colombo 10) near Ananda College on January 27 at 10 am.
“We have heard enough songs written in praise of mothers. But the same cannot be said on the fathers. There is one particular song that addresses this issue. The song indicates that no adequate number of songs has been written in praise of fathers. But when you study deeper, you will find enough literature in appreciation of paternity,” Priyankara elaborated his mission.
The research contains 100 songs written in appreciation of fathers.
