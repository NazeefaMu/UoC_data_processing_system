Sri Lanka assured of continued Commonwealth trade, commercial support

Sri Lanka has clinched continued support for its international trade work from the Commonwealth at the inaugural Commonwealth Trade Ministers Meeting that opened in London on March 9.
Industry and Commerce Minister Rishad Bathiudeen and Development  Strategies and International Trade Minister Malik Samarawickrama with Commonwealth Secretary-General Patricia Scotland at the inaugural Commonwealth Trade Minister’s Meeting in London.
Industry and Commerce Minister Rishad Bathiudeen representing Sri Lanka has been extended commonwealth support to develop Sri Lanka’s international trade in many ways.
“I am pleased that talks with Commonwealth Secretary-General Patricia Scotland on March 9 in London were successful and we are set to receive continued positive support from the Commonwealth to our international trade work as a result.” Bathiudeen said.
“Sri Lanka’s historic relations with the Commonwealth stands further enhanced with this pioneering London event. Especially the “Agenda for Growth” idea to promote trade, investment and job creation in member countries such as Sri Lanka shall help our unity government’s reform vision of industry and commerce.”
Secretary-General Scotland thanked Sri Lanka for their contribution to the Commonwealth Trade Finance Facility and discussed ongoing projects where the Secretariat is providing technical assistance to Sri Lanka. These include support with free trade agreement negotiations, designing an export diversification strategy and helping to set up an export/import bank.
The inaugural Commonwealth Trade Ministers Meeting (CTMM) took place at Lancaster House in London on 9 and 10 March in advance of the 2018 Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting (CHOGM) in the UK, with many trade ministers of the Commonwealth joining the event. The objective of CTMM is to reaffirm the commitment of Commonwealth member countries to a “transparent free and fair multilateral trading system,” and to define an ambitious Commonwealth led “Agenda for Growth” to promote trade, investment and job creation in member countries. This will support the target of increasing intra-Commonwealth trade to US$1 trillion by 2020.
The recommendation to hold the March 9-10 meeting was an outcome of the Commonwealth Business Forum in Malta in November 2015.
