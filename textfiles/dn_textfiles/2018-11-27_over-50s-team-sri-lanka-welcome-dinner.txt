With its lobby bar featuring several cricket memorabilia at the Blue Elephant Restaurant in West Pennant Hills was the perfect setting to host the Over 50s Sri Lankan team “Meet and Greet” function which held recently.
The framed cricket items on the the walls provided much discussion and reflection on past players and of that epic 1996 World Cup win! Perhaps this year these veteran players will bring honour and glory at a time when both country and cricket need something to cheer about.
Emcee Duke Ramachandran got proceedings underway with the traditional lighting of the lamp by some of the distinguished guests and this was followed by a heart warming welcome address by Richie De Silva (convener and player) instrumental in forming the Sri Lankan contingent for these games. He was lavish in thanking all those who supported this venture and was hopeful that a tournament of this calibre would continue in the future. His Excellency S. Skandakumar’s bowling deliveries as a dashing cricketer is only surpassed by his effortless delivery of speeches and he regaled the invitees with humour and inspiration.
Consul General Lal Wickrematunge also a cricketer of repute welcomed this initiate for senior players and commended the players on their voluntary contributions in coming forward to represent Team Sri Lanka.
Captain Marlon Von Hagt was magnanimous in thanking all the sponsors and stressed the importance of “listening to our bodies and staying injury free”. Stirling Hamman of Veterans Cricket Australia spoke of the “hidden and un-trodden” journey towards organizing this inaugural extravaganza and spoke of the friendships and memories these games would last into the future.
No stranger to the cricket circle . Harry Solomons of Kingsgrove Sports and former Sri Lankan cricketer B. N. Mahamed shared the honoured tradition of presenting the player caps.
