Aranayake landslides – 2016
Resettlement zones to be renamed

Plantations where displaced people were resettled following the 2016 landslides in Aranayake and its adjoining areas, are to be renamed soon. The decision was taken by the Aranayake Co-ordinating Committee at a meeting held yesterday, in response to a proposal made by Aranayake Divisional Secretary Z. A. M. Faisal.
Giving the new list of names, Faizal said the Ruwandeniya land, renamed as ‘Lanka-China Friendship Village’ would not be changed. But other names would be changed as follows: the Naramgammana Ambadeniya estate Gavilipita division as ‘Siyapth Uyana,’ Kalugala Debathgama estate as ‘Mihidum Uyana’, Thalgamuwa estate as ‘Arunodagama,’ Thalgaspitiya Muslim Gama Watta as ‘Salmal Uyana’ Dooldeniya estate as ‘Rukmal Uyana,’ Hambalakkawa Watta as ‘Thidesaruna’ and Kirihamy Watta as ‘Thuruliya Sevana.’
Faisal said that since the co-ordinating committee decided on the names unanimously, they would be submitted to the District Development Committee for approval and thereafter, would be gazetted.
