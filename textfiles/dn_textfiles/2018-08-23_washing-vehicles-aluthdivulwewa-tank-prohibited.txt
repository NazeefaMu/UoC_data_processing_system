Washing vehicles at Aluthdivulwewa tank prohibited

The Working Committee of the Aluthdivulwewa Agrarian Association had decided not to permit buses and other vehicles to be washed in the Aluthdivulwewa tank in Galenbindunuwewa with effect from August 21.
Aluthdivulwewa Agrarian Association Chairman Premasiri Karunathilake said the association would take action against those who wash vehicles in the tank after this date.
He said that due to the washing of vehicles, the tank water is being polluted. Aquatic creatures such as fish and fresh water prawn are at risk due to pollution.
Karunathilake added that there was a thin film of oil on the surface of the water, causing a threat to the existence of aquatic creatures.
He said since most of the small tanks in the area have dried up due to the drought, people come to the Aluthdivulwewa tank for their water requirements.
“Some people wash tractors, vans, three wheelers, lorries, cars and motorcycles in the tank. None of these vehicles would be permitted to be washed from August 21,” he added.
