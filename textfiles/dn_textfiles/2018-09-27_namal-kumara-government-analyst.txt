Namal Kumara at Government Analyst

Namal Kumara arrived at the CID at around 9.00 am yesterday to hand over more evidence on DIG Nalaka Silva and to give a voice sample to the Government Analyst.
The CID had notified him yesterday that he had to report to the Government Analist’s Department to provide a sample of his voice.
Addressing the media, Namal Kumara said that he had brought with him another recorded conversation between him and DIG Nalaka Silva to be handed over to the CID. “I will not hand over this CD to the media as Nalaka Silva is a trained expert and he knows how to escape from the law. Hence, there is a lot of evidence in this CD and lets see what happens. If the law was a strong wave, Nalaka Silva is well aware of how to escape without getting wet,” he added.
Subsequently, Namal Kumara was escorted by CID officers to the Government Analysts Department in Battaramulla yesterday. Meanwhile, the Police Spokesman SP Ruwan Gunasekara told media that the arrested Indian national Mercil Thomas who was arrested on September 21 based on a complaint made by Namal Kumara that this Indian man had visited his home on several occasions raising suspicion. This Indian national had arrived in the country in January 2017 and lived in several areas in the country. The CID had not got a clear answer from him during investigations on how he receives money for his survival here.
Therefore, the CID is conducting further investigations as to how he received money. However, the Police Media Spokesman stressed that this Indian national had not at any point disclosed any information regarding an assassination plot. “Having seen the news regarding the press briefing held by Namal Kumara and the subsequent news reports, he said he had felt that several people were under threat. It was this reason that he had gone to Namal’s home to find up more information. The CID had also filed a B report at the Fort Magistrate’s Court regarding the further details of this incident. But even in this B report there was no mention of this Indian revealing anything about an assassination plot,” he said.
The Indian national is held in the custody of the CID for further interrogation and investigations,
the Police Spokesman said.
