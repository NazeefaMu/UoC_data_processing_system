Self-regulation for social media

When we talk about social media self-regulation, a number of questions will crop up. Who will create a code of ethics to be adapted to the online environment? What kind of challenges does convergence bring to social media self-regulation? What is the impact of the self-regulatory process on Press Complaints Commissions? Who should follow whether the editors and administrators are maintaining the specified ethical standards? Here again, public debate and discussions are needed to find acceptable answers
Addressing the 28th Law Asia Conference in Colombo, the Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe commented that time had come for the legal sector and the Government to think whether it was possible to regulate social media. “On the other hand,” he questioned, “If you regulate social media, is it a violation of Fundamental Rights?”
Prime Minister’s concern is quite justifiable. Social media are truly becoming absolute hits among today’s population regardless of age, sex or location. There is no doubt that social networking sites have become an essential element and support for current modern lifestyle and communities. Thus, the conclusion is clear: social media is here to stay.
Defining “social media” is difficult because of the wide variety of stand-alone and built-in services available, but for our purpose we will settle for a simple definition. “Social media is an umbrella term used to describe social interaction through a suite of technology based tools, most of which are internet based. This includes, but is not limited to, internet forums, networking sites such as Facebook, Twitter, and LinkedIn, webcasts, and blogs.”
This emergence and staggering growth had brought along with it a wide range of ethical issues worth giving our attention.
What are they? To quote few:
(1) Privacy/Anonymity - When social networking, no one can ever guarantee that they are contacting the real person. The majority of users are unaware that when they register, upload content, post comments etc. they are allowing huge organisations to “stalk” their private information
(2) Free speech - In democratic ideology, free speech is always supported. But it is a dangerous weapon for specific groups of people to manipulate this right to spark unethical sentiments such as racial or religious hatred through social media.
(3) Data Leakage - Many new technologies related to data security and protection have been introduced to the market in the recent years. Yet, data leakage still remains as a big issue. It has been proven that social networking is one prime culprit.
(4) Identity Theft - This is a form of technique used by criminals to impersonate someone’s identity with intention to pursue or commit for crime. Identity theft is prominently found in social media sites.
No social media site is a safe space. There are so many hidden dangers and ethical concerns in every site. Social media blurs private/public boundaries when individuals’ personal information and opinions enter the public domain. The boundaries between personal and work life also become blurred as companies make use of social media for business purposes.
These unique characteristics of social media pose serious ethical challenges for both personal and business users.
Social media abuse
Every other day we do come across an abundance of incidents of abuse of social media platforms by mischievous elements with malicious intentions. Of late, there has been a surge in such abuse on social networking websites through propagation of falsehood, defamation, character assassination and even extremist religious and racial views.
Angry and abusive comments routinely continue to feed the trolls. False perception and mistaken belief of unlimited freedom of expression and the thrill and excitement of instant transmission of message, mostly among younger generation, make the matter worse. We find many social media sites publish posts and stories, which are technically defamatory, without carrying out even minimum due-diligence in regard to the veracity and authenticity of the information.
With no visible censorship, regulation, control and monitoring, there is very often a tendency among social media users to go berserk, even at the slightest of provocation. Bogus / fake accounts abound in the social media and somehow escape the eagle eye of cyber sleuths and cyber-crime control agencies.
Public discussions
This brings us to a number of serious questions: Should we allow to continue unhindered and unpunished the prevailing “free for all” scenario? Or should we put in place some kind of regulatory mechanism? Or, as our Prime Minister has queried, whether too much of cyber-policing not lead to encroachment on individual freedom of expression? Won’t such a move be perceived as an attack on fundamental rights and democratic principles?
Public discussions are needed to come to a solution or compromise.
At the same time, the uniqueness of social media has changed the rules of the game. Now anyone can have a broadcast channel. In fact, everyone now is a channel itself. Each person on the social networking site is a content developer, a script writer, an author and an editor. Millions of such “self-styled professionals” have been thrown into the massive ocean of cyberspace to share their pearls of wisdom with the rest of the world.
The result is the phenomenon of having 24x7 news without newspapers, round-the-clock online journalism without journalists. This makes the task of regulation and keeping vigil on the activities much more difficult or maybe, impossible.
Self-regulation
The widespread availability of content deemed harmful has inspired concern among right thinking people. At the moment, there is no common understanding of the rules that should internationally govern the Internet. Hence self-regulation appears to be the best solution to increase online accountability while offering more flexibility than state regulation. And it is the only mechanism which wouldn’t hurt the right of free-speech.
Digitalization not only has changed the way people communicate, it has transformed profoundly and irreversibly the nature of journalism and ethics. While social media encourages people to speak their minds, democracy still demands editors and administrators of those sites to provide reliable and impartial news and analysis. A crucial task of self-regulatory mechanisms is to foster public trust in the social media.
Social media self-regulation cannot succeed in a repressive environment. However, when social media freedom is guaranteed, self-regulation can help preserve the independence of social media and protect it from government interference.
When we talk about social media self-regulation, again a number of questions will crop up. Who will create a code of ethics to be adapted to the online environment? What kind of challenges does convergence bring to social media self-regulation? What is the impact of the self-regulatory process on Press Complaints Commissions? Who should follow whether the editors and administrators are maintaining the specified ethical standards?
Here again, public debate and discussions are needed to find acceptable answers.
Corrections
Social media is not meant to be a tool to carry out any malicious and vicious campaign against any individual, religion, belief, community or any group. Nor is it meant to settle personal scores. Strongest of criticisms and disagreements are supposed to be expressed in polite manner.
But, all said and done, the behaviour in the social media cannot be viewed in isolation. It is only a reflection of the general behavioural pattern of the country. That is why a self-imposed code of conduct, norm and social media ethic is the best way to tackle this menace
Until the time adequate self-regulatory systems, processes and mechanisms are built into social media networks to inspire the confidence of public and government to allow things to run in auto-pilot-mode, it is only natural that agencies of the government will need to step in to bring some semblance of order or discipline.
Most Press Complaints Commissions still rely on moral sanctions, particularly “critical adjudications” and a right of reply which the offending media should publish. However, the publication of a critical adjudication or of any other sanction such as correction or an apology can be less prominent on the Internet than in a print edition.
For this reason, Press Complaints Commission (PCC) of UK has issued new guidance on prominence for corrections, clarifications and apologies published online. It said, “The correction or adjudication should appear in the relevant section of the site where the original article appeared and should link back to the original article, assuming it is still online. It is also important that online corrections and apologies were searchable in the same way as any other article”
One of the key functions of the PCC of UK is the negotiation of published remedies to complaints, in the form of letters, corrections and apologies. Clause1 (Accuracy) of the Code requires that corrections and apologies be published with “due prominence.”
On the subject of self-regulation of social media, including how to implement it successfully, we can learn a lot from the PCC of UK and Finland’s Council for Mass Media.
