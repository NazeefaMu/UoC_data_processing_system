President urges public not to vote for addicts

President Maithripala Sirisena urged the public not to vote for any candidate addicted to drugs and or alcohol, at the forthcoming local government elections, on Saturday .
The President said that candidates addicted to drugs or alcohol will not be able to develop the country or work for the people’s benefit.
He made these remarks at an election meeting held at Polonnaruwa in support of the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) candidates contesting from the district. The President went on to say that drugs were causing immense harm to schoolchildren and stressed his commitment to obtain the support from all stakeholders to liberate the country form this menace.
While noting that drug and alcohol abusers were more prevalent among low-income earners, the President said that the menace has played a direct hand in enhancing poverty.
The President said he would launch a national action plan to rid the country from drug and alcohol abuse, with the support of the people’s political representatives from grassroots level upwards, after the election.
