Batticaloa airport opens to civilian traffic on Sunday

The Batticaloa airport will be opened to civilian air traffic from Sunday, March 25, making direct air connectivity for passengers between Sri Lanka’s east and other parts of the country, a reality.
The government has spent nearly Rs. 1,400 million for the renovation of the airport after its operations and maintenance were vested with the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) from May 31, 2016. The airport was used for military operations for the past 25 years, during the war.
The airport has been renovated with an extended 1,066-metre re-built runway and passenger terminal.
Several private airlines have already expressed their willingness to operate domestic flights between Ratmalana and Batticaloa.
