Kaliyodai River in jeopardy

The Kaliyodai River in Oluvil has been polluted by putting in it building blocks and other materials by certain parties.
Farmers in the area have lodged complaints about the pollution to relevant authorities but no action has been taken so far to stop it.
During the rainy season, they have to undergo untold hardships due to the building blocks.
