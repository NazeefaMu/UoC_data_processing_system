Discipline, keyword to accomplishment

Fiercely upholding one’s integrity in the face of challenges and performing one’s duty to country and society are values instilled in Head Boy Mustafa Qaidjohar and Head Girl Zenab Zoeb of Burhani Serendib School, Bambalapitiya. Perfect Prefects features these two leaders who are being moulded to achieve that very purpose.
Head Girl Zenab Zoeb feels that the troubles and distress in society are mostly of our own making, stating that a lot of our problems stem from our mindset.
“Issues like racism, terrorism, intolerance towards those who are different can be attributed to this. Even Global warming and War can be solved if we just change our mindset. We need to work for the betterment and good of mankind. At my age, I do not have abundant resources to do much about this. The goal right now is to focus on what I am doing right now so that when I grow up I can turn into a responsible citizen. When we are well informed and well moulded, when we grow up, we can take up these issues and solve them. Today’s issues may not be tomorrow’s issues because we live in fast-changing times with technology changing so fast,” explained Zoeb.
Vital strength
Zoeb stated that achieving certain goals is no easy matter and knowing what you want at the very beginning before you start something definitely helps. She says that while you are working towards what you want, you need to keep in mind that you should not give up. Knowing your strengths is vital. Often there are multiple ways of achieving your goals, but if you want to succeed, your chances are better if you play to your strengths which will help in achieving your goals.
“Right now I am still not 100 per cent sure about my ambition, because I am interested in the science field as well as the commerce field. So right now I am keeping my options open. So my end goal is to do what I enjoy doing. And I think when you have control over what is going on in your life, then that is when you enjoy life the most. I envision a future where I will be working for myself like an entrepreneur in whatever field I choose, and hopefully doing something that will be something new. I may go abroad or stay in Sri Lanka. So right now I am trying to gain an all-round education which will prepare me and equip me to face the future,” said Zenab.
Zoeb enthusiastically says that her school, Burhani Serendib has given her ample opportunities to showcase her talents and hone her skills. She proudly says that her school has always placed a lot of trust in her and she is truly grateful for that. For this she thanks the Principal, the academic staff and the non-academic staff.
“I am very much into community service projects. I was the President of the Interact Club and now am a member of the Interact District Council. I love putting a smile on someone else’s face and actually making a difference. I enjoy socializing and public speaking. I took part in Sri Lanka Model United Nations which I have been taking part consecutively from 2015- 2018. MUN has been an awesome experience. The most important thing you learn is diplomacy which is very important when you enter the outside world. You learn problem-solving and how to deal with people. People may disagree with you but you learn how to reach a common consensus which works out for the greater good,” pointed out Zoeb.
Moral responsibility
Zenab states that being honest and true to yourself is as important as being a responsible citizen. She again stressed on the keywords – ‘moral sense of responsibility’, ‘humility’ and ‘sense of duty’.
“For the betterment of the country we need to be responsible citizens and look inwards and then outwards so that the change we aspire to create, starts within us. For example, as a student in school or even as a citizen in the country, you need to make sure you are honest and true to yourself while preserving our roots and traditions. You need to have a sense of integrity. As human beings, we should have this moral sense of responsibility within ourselves. Everything we do should be channelled towards the betterment of humankind. We should be able to give back to country, society and school through what we are doing and stay humble,” added Zoeb.
She placed much emphasis on remaining true to your roots and origins while expanding your horizons at the same time, saying that it is all about finding that balance.
“If you want to bring some change to the world, in order for it to be accepted you need to follow the accepted social norms to get to where you want to be in the end. So you need to strike that balance between tradition and progress. I find solace in the things that are close to heart like family and religion,” said Zoeb.
Happy performance
Head Boy Mustafa Qaidjohar asserted that you need not follow Stereotypes. At the end of the day, you need to be happy while performing your duty to society. Ultimately you are not running a race against others.
“I think to succeed one thing you need is self- awareness. One place where I feel we go wrong is when we try to be overly ambitious where we feel we have to excel in everything. For some people, it works, but for me what is important is that you are more aware of yourself and focus on what you are good at. Also, the work you put in makes all the difference because the more work you put in the better the results are,” said Qaidjohar.
He says that right now he has not decided on what to do in the future but wants to pursue a path that will give him mental satisfaction and happiness. Entrepreneurship is an area that he finds enticing but repeats that it boils down to what makes him happy. Satisfaction, financial stability and being good at what he is doing will all fall in place when he figures out what he likes.
“Studying in the Commerce field right now, what I do will be related to that stream. I too enjoy Social Service a lot, because I find genuine happiness in helping others. Anything that exposes me to the world like even public speaking is something that I value because I love networking with people. I have been part of Interact and I am in the district council now.
I am the Assistant DIR (District Interact Representative). I am the President of my Leo Club and I have been doing MUN for the past four years consecutively,” explained Qaidjohar.
MUN transformed his life. He states that you get to know about global issues that you didn’t even know existed. The solutions can be amazingly complex he says. He points out that during the first year you sit on the bench and learn the procedures of the UN and you learn about global issues. Then during the second and third years, you do some research and focus on finding solutions. He enthusiastically says that MUN has really improved his general knowledge. He points out that at the end of the day after all the debates and arguments when it comes to changing mindsets there is so much to learn. On one hand, you have ideas but then you have to implement those solutions in the real world. So it is a totally different challenge.
Easy competitions
“The opportunities our school gives our students are endless. It can be from speech competitions, essay competitions, MUN and Interact. Our school has always placed trust in us. Our school always puts our interests first in every aspect. At our school you are always free to talk with the principal or anyone because the door is always open,” pointed out Qaidjohar.
Like Zoeb he mentioned some keywords when it comes to the role we play in society. Those keywords are ‘discipline’, ‘responsibility’ and ‘attitude’.
“You need to think Global and act Local. As the youth, we need to have that sense of integrity. It can be the smallest thing. For example being mindful about keeping your water running in the bathroom. If everyone does this it can make a huge difference. The attitude is the important thing. So if every individual does their part there can be a huge difference. It boils down to integrity. You need to have the discipline to follow the rules. As a citizen can you keep yourself from breaking the traffic rule? If everyone does that think how it could radically cut down on accidents.
Even though there is no one watching, can you keep yourself from littering the road?” added Qaidjohar.
Mental Health is a subject that makes him passionate and he points out that with all the chaos in society a lot of love needs to go around.
“I am very passionate about mental health. Again it all boils down to mindset. I feel there is a lot of chaos in society today because people are so worried about what others think of them and they are so worried about other people’s judgements. Everyone is caught up in a rat race to prove themselves.
You need to be satisfied with yourself and what you are doing. I want to be stable on my own so I can help others,” said Qaidjohar.
