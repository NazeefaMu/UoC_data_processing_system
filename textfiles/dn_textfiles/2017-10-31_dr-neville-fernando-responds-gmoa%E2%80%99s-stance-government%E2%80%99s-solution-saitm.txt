Dr. Neville Fernando responds to the GMOA’s stance on Government’s solution to SAITM

 
In an official statement, Dr. Neville Fernando, Chairman of the South Asian Institute of Technology and Medicine (SAITM) responded to the GMOA’s stance on the Government’s solution to SAITM.
Dr. Neville Fernando said he was pleased to note that the GMOA has accepted the government’s solution regarding the issue - even if with some reservations.
Therefore, he said, he urged the GMOA to get students of state medical faculties to continue their lectures and clinical training enabling them to qualify, obtain postgraduate training and become consultants.
He also said he had put the past years behind him and hoped the GMOA will reciprocate – “I will remain content on achieving and establishing the right to freedom of education in Sri Lanka,” he said.
