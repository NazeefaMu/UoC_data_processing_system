Maha Sangha showing the way

The picture on the front page of several newspapers yesterday showing a group of Buddhist monks walking in single file to the premises of the Jaffna Hospital to donate blood is indeed a refreshing sight from the many pictures carried in the same newspapers in recent times depicting members of the Sangha participating in violent demonstrations and being manhandled by the police. According to the report accompanying the picture, a group of 100 Bikkhus donated blood at the Jaffna Hospital in response to an SOS for urgent need of blood due to depleted stocks at the hospital. The Maha Sangha who donated blood was led by Pepiliyana Sunethra Devi Pirivenadhipathy and Sri Jayawardenapura University Professor the Ven. Medagoda Abhayatissa. It was only last week that a group of soldiers donated blood to the Jaffna Hospital. This was perhaps the first time that members of the Sangha, as a body, had donated blood to the Jaffna Hospital, or anywhere, for that matter. Hence it should be taken as a sign of willingness on the part of the majority community to integrate with their brethren in the north, dismantling all barriers that had hitherto stood in the way of both sides, with the Maha Sangha, who carries the voice of the majority community, showing the way.
Both, members of the Sangha and those of the security forces have long been seen as being hostile towards the minority communities. There has been some justification in this respect given the recent utterances of certain militant monks and also the conduct and antics of certain members of the Bikkhu community. But, by and large, our Maha Sangha in general have time and again shown by their deeds that they bore no ill will towards the Tamil community. The blood donated by the members of the Sangha at the Jaffna Hospital, no doubt, will be transfused to the Tamil patients in the north. This, while being an act of merit, is a sign of the brotherhood displayed by the majority community towards their Tamil brethren as exemplified by the act of the Bikkhus, giving meaning to the core teaching of the Buddha that hatred ceaseth not by hatred but by love and compassion. It is important that this noble gesture on the part of the members of the Maha Sangha and the security forces be made a catalyst to cement bonds with a once estranged community, moving further closer to the goal of reconciliation.
More and more missions of this nature should be promoted by the authorities to bring the two communities closer. The media too can play an important role in this exercise. Unfortunately certain media today tend to bring out the differences between the two communities, more, than working towards uniting the two sides. Certain events in the north are reported out of context to give it a communal twist that could exacerbate ingrained prejudices. Sometimes, violent incidents in the north are being portrayed as signs of a revival of the LTTE while similar or identical incidents take place in the south which are all part of the criminal world. Such portrayal of incidents invariable influence the minds of the majority community to view all Tamils with hostility which is a step back on the road to reconciliation. Hence it is the bounden duty of the media to act with responsibility whereby it should strive to bring out the positives rather than the negatives aspects of communal relations.
Now that the members of the Maha Sangha and the Military, no less, have shown the way, it is hoped that the rancour and bitterness engendered by long years of estrangement would be banished once and for all and the two communities join together in peaceful co-existence as sons and daughters of one nation.
Be that as it may, Tamil politicians too should make their contribution towards fostering good relations between the two communities. Like the Bikkhus have done, they too should undertake missions to the south that will send a message to the majority community that they are serious in working towards reconciliation. They have a good opportunity for doing this now, with a senior and respected Tamil politician functioning as the Leader of the Opposition. The recent act by Opposition Leader R. Sampanthan and a group of Tamil politicians from the north, distributing flood relief in Ratnapura was viewed positively by many. More and more gestures of this nature from Sampathan and his colleagues would help alley suspicion by the majority Sinhalese. As Leader of the Opposition he now has the scope and opportunity to work for the nation at large rather than confining himself to represent his people in the north alone. Regrettably, some of the politicians in the north continue to make statements that echo the past which certainly make things difficult for moderate politicians like Sampanthan. They are not only antagonising the majority community by their utterances but also negate the gestures of the like made by the group of Bikkhus who donated blood at the Jaffna Hospital.
