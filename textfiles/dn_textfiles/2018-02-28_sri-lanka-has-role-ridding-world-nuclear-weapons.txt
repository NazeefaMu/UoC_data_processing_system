Sri Lanka has role in ridding world of nuclear weapons

Sri Lanka does not have nuclear weapons. And like many small countries around the world, it probably never will. But as the threat of nuclear warfare reaches Cold War levels, Sri Lanka could play a role in getting rid of the world’s stockpile of nuclear weapons.
Sri Lanka, along with 121 other countries, adopted the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons, at the United Nations in July 2017.
The historic treaty, which was opposed by the world’s major nuclear powers, bans the possession, testing, stationing, use, and threat of use of nuclear weapons.
The intended effect of the ban is to “increase the moral pressure” for all countries to get rid of their nuclear arms, said Professor Ramesh Thakur of the Australian National University’s disarmament programme and Asia-Pacific Leadership Network, at a lecture in Colombo earlier this month.
“What the non-possessor states can do is to stigmatize the very possession of nuclear weapons and to delegitimize the possession and threat of use of nuclear weapons,” he said. So far, only five of the 122 countries that adopted the treaty at the UN have ratified it. Sri Lanka has neither signed nor ratified the treaty since adopting it last year. “We are at a particularly critical juncture in world affairs,” Professor Thakur said. “I think we are in danger of sleepwalking our way into a nuclear disaster.”
Nuclear tipping point
The threat of nuclear war appears to be growing, not shrinking.
The famous “Doomsday Clock” now stands at two minutes to midnight. The clock, which has been maintained since 1947 by the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists, tracks how close the world may be to nuclear catastrophe, or “midnight.”
The last time the clock stood at two minutes – the closest the minute hand has ever been to midnight – was in 1953.
The bulletin said it moved the clock up this year because of the progress of North Korea’s nuclear programme, the increasingly heated rhetoric from the United States, and tension between major nuclear powers like the US and Russia, China and the US, and India and Pakistan.
In the South Asian context, both India and Pakistan are actively testing missile technology, and disarmament talks are at a near halt, according to Professor Sadia Tasleem, of the Department of Defence and Strategic Studies at Quaid-i-Azam University in Pakistan.
“The space for disarmament debate is also shrinking,” she said at a recent public forum in Colombo.
“The risk that nuclear weapons may be used - intentionally or because of miscalculation - grew last year around the globe,” the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists said in its annual report. “This is a dangerous time, but the danger is of our own making.”
Nine countries now possess around 15,000 nuclear weapons. The United States and Russia have the largest arsenals by far, with 6,800 and 7,000 warheads, respectively.
According to the International Campaign to Abolish Nuclear Weapons, which won the 2017 Nobel Peace Prize, the US and Russia maintain about 1,800 nuclear weapons on high-alert status, meaning they are ready to be launched within minutes.
The rest of the world’s nuclear warheads are held by France, the United Kingdom, China, India, Pakistan, Israel, and North Korea.
If any of these countries used their weapons against each other, there would be deadly effects felt around the world.
“A single nuclear bomb detonated over a large city could kill millions of people,” according to the campaign.“The use of tens or hundreds of nuclear bombs would disrupt the global climate, causing widespread famine.”
Professor Thakur, who served as an advisor to the Australian and New Zealand governments on arms control and disarmament, said the old model for maintaining peace, known as “deterrence,” has proven ineffective.
The deterrence theory rests on the assumption that world powers that hold nuclear weapons will not attack each other, or each other’s allies, based on mutually-assured destruction. A nuclear attack on an enemy would basically guarantee destruction at home from retaliatory attacks.
But “the historical record is actually quite sceptical of the utility of nuclear deterrence,” Thakur said. He argued that the ownership of nuclear weapons has not reduced aggression in geopolitical conflicts: the Soviet Union, for example, expanded its control into Eastern Europe when the United States had a monopoly of nuclear weapons in the 1940s.
“Non-possession by the Soviet Union did not deter them from expanding,” he said.
He said military defeats of the Soviet Union in Afghanistan, and the United States in Vietnam, showed that nuclear powers were “unable to convert that nuclear monopoly…into any battlefield utility.”
“A bit like the emperor with no clothes, maybe it’s time to call out the nuclear emperor for being naked,” he said.
He also argued that deterrence theory doesn’t account for accidents, such as an accidental launch or seizure by terror groups.
And those threats may be less abstract than we think. The American investigative reporter Steve Coll, for a recent book, obtained documents from India’s external intelligence service showing that they believe the Pakistani naval frigate Zulfiqar contained a nuclear warhead at the time it was attacked by Al Qaeda in 2014.
The attack was successfully thwarted, but the proximity of a non-state terror group to obtaining a nuclear weapon is frightening.
“The solution instead lies in nuclear disarmament,” Thakur said.
Disarmament attempts
The major nuclear powers took a first step towards disarmament in 1968, with the signing of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT).
The basis of the non-proliferation treaty was that non-nuclear weapons states would never acquire nuclear weapons, while nuclear states would agree to share information on peaceful nuclear technology, while pursuing disarmament.
But critics think the usefulness of the treaty has run out.
“Since the NPT’s entry into force, another four countries have acquired nuclear weapons,” Thakur said. “Israel, India, Pakistan, and North Korea.”
And although the sheer amount of nuclear weapons has been reduced through bilateral agreements, the threat of nuclear war is higher than it has been in years. “The net conclusion is that perhaps the NPT is perhaps no longer fit for purpose,” Thakur said.
For this reason, many activists hope the newly adopted nuclear ban treaty will achieve the unfulfilled goals of the old treaty.
The world’s major nuclear powers, the United States and Russia, explicitly opposed the nuclear ban treaty.
After it was adopted, the US, the UK, and France issued a joint statement saying the ban disregarded the realities of the international security environment, and that they did “not intend to sign, ratify or ever become party to it.”
Professor Thakur argued that the adoption of the ban itself shows the increasing power of non-nuclear states given voice in the UN General Assembly, and that increased pressure on the international platform can have tangible effects.
Although 56 countries have signed the nuclear weapon ban treaty, only five have ratified it. It needs 50 ratifications to come into force.
“I’m confident they’ll come,” Thakur said.
“That said, I think the normative impact will be much stronger once that number climbs to approximately 100,” he added. A majority of states in the international community taking a firm position against nuclear weapons would break a “psychological threshold,” he argued.
Asked why Sri Lanka has neither signed nor ratified the ban, Foreign Ministry spokesperson Mahishini Colonne said that “the matter is under active consideration by the relevant authorities, and Sri Lanka supports the Treaty in principle.”
South Asian perspectives
Experts from around the world agree that non-proliferation and disarmament need a new strategy. “The non-proliferation treaty has reached the end of its success,” said Rakesh Sood, India’s former Ambassador to the Conference on Disarmament in Geneva. He was speaking at a forum at the Lakshman Kadirgamar Institute.
The only “certain way” to achieve peace, he said, “is through nuclear disarmament.” Sri Lanka’s former Foreign Secretary and former Permanent Representative to the United Nations, H.M.G.S. Palihakkara said the old non-proliferation treaty had allowed nuclear countries to maintain their status without consequence.
“The existing nuclear countries want to lock in their status and de-legitimize everybody else’s,” he said.
Even though Sri Lanka is a small island, it has a role to play in the geopolitical arena, said University of Colombo Dean Nayani Melegoda.
“As a small non-nuclear state, we cannot afford the prospect of nuclear conflict in the Indian Ocean region,” she said.
Sri Lanka should use its “historical links between its broader non-aligned foreign policy and nuclear non-proliferation and disarmament,” she said.
If Sri Lanka signed and ratified the nuclear ban treaty, it would bring the number of states that have, up to six. It’s not many, but the anti-nuclear activists argue that for every state like Sri Lanka that ratifies, the pressure increases.
