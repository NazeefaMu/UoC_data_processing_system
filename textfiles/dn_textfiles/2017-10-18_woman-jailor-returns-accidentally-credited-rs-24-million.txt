Woman jailor returns accidentally credited  Rs. 2.4 million

S. A. Premalatha, a woman jailor attached to the Prisons Department with 40 years service, has returned a sum of Rs 2.4 million accidentally credited to her savings account at the Bank of Ceylon Borella branch and earned plaudits from the bank staff for her sincerity and honesty.
Two months ago, she had received a short message on her mobile phone saying a sum of Rs 1.2 million had been credited to her savings account. As she got ready to visit the bank to ascertain the source from which she had received the money, she had received another text saying a sum of Rs 1.2 million had been credited once more to her account.
Thereafter, she had paid a random visit to the bank and met the Bank Manager to check the outstanding balance in her passbook. To her bewilderment, the Manager had informed that a total sum of Rs 2.4 million had been credited to her account and asked whether she wanted to withdraw the money. Premalatha had said the money did not belong to her and that she had come to see how such a large sum of money had been credited to her account.
When the Bank Manager summoned a lady officer attached to the cash department, it transpired that the money belonging to another customer had been mistakenly credited to her account. Bank staff had been unaware of the mistake until Premalatha made inquiries about it.
S. A. Premalatha, a resident of Mulleriyawa, Angoda is a mother of three, married to a fellow jailor. She said she had not received a promotion despite her 40 years' service. She was promoted sergeant at last on the day of her retirement.
