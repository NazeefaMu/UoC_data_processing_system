‘Indo-Sri Lanka relations span across multitude of areas’

Sri Lanka's High Commissioner in India Chitranganee Wagiswara said India is the closest neighbour and Indo-Sri Lanka relations span across a multitude of areas. Sri Lanka has resources and capacity to move towards further progress and economic prosperity, she said.
She was speaking at the ceremony at the High Commission of Sri Lanka in New Delhi organised to commemorate Sri Lanka's 70th Independence Day.
Two events were organised to celebrate the 70th anniversary of independence.
The official ceremony in the morning of February 4 commenced with the hoisting of the National Flag amidst the sound of the ceremonial drums Magul Bera. Following the rendering of the National Anthem in Sinhala and Tamil, religious dignitaries representing all four religions in Sri Lanka – Buddhism, Hinduism, Islam and Christianity – blessed the country, the leaders and its people.
The rest of the programme included two minute silence observed in honour of the national heroes of Sri Lanka, followed by the reading of Independence Day messages of President Maithripala Sirisena, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe and Foreign Minister Tilak Marapana. The High Commissioner lit the traditional oil lamp together with members representing all three communities and several prominent members of the Sri Lankan community in New Delhi.
At the end of the formal event two brief Sri Lankan dance items were performed by the “Olaboduwa Dance Troupe” from Sri Lanka adding colour to the event. The invitees numbering around 120 Sri Lankan expatriates and students who are in New Delhi were hosted to a traditional Sri Lankan breakfast. An alms giving was held prior to the official ceremony at the official residence of the High commissioner for the Buddhist clergy, representing the major Sri Lankan Buddhist temples and Institutes in India.
On February 6, a Reception was hosted for political dignitaries, Senior Government Officials of India, members of the diplomatic corps, eminent business leaders, other special invitees and members of the Sri Lankan community at the residence of the High Commissioner. Around 800 guests attended the reception. The Chief Guest of the event was Ravi Shankar Prasad, Minister of Law and Justice and Electronics and Information Technology of India.
Welcoming the Chief Guest, the High Commissioner said that the leaders of the two countries have exchanged several visits and that such interactions have brought about a “new momentum” to the “special relationship” between the two countries.
The Olaboduwa Dance Troupe from Sri Lanka presented a human lamp formation which was lit by the Chief Guest and the High Commissioner symbolizing the human ability to light the world to bring peace and prosperity.
The High Commission arranged for the guests to savour Indian as well as Sri Lankan cuisine. A special tea kiosk was set up for the visitors to taste Sri Lanka tea.
