Mr and Mrs Public Servant are you awake?

Population projections indicate that by 2031, 21.9% of the population of Sri Lanka will be over the age of 60. Sri Lanka is thus expected to be the first low per-capita income country to enter into this global phenomenon. With the aged dependency set to rise from 13.5 in1991 to 36.0 in 2031, the financial burden will fall on the working age population. In other words, 6 workers supported one aged person in 2001, but 3 will have to support one elder in 2031.
Moreover, the elderly population in rural areas is five times the elderly population in urban areas. Therefore, with low household incomes associated with rural households, their burden will be felt more.
Seniors are susceptible to –(i) Functional Decline that reduces our mobility, strength, balance, agility, leading toward increasingly levels of frailty, (ii) Age-related Disease including dementia, cardiovascular disease, osteoarthritis, osteoporosis, diabetes, cancer, strokes, age-related macular degeneration (AMD or ARMD), and glaucoma and (iii) Nonphysical challenges -Vulnerability- from home and society, Mental breakdown. It requires – (i) Age-related Adaptation: As the body becomes increasingly frail, our primary task is to successfully adapt to more profound levels of functional decline, frailty, and dependence and (ii) Age-related Health Care for Psychological Challenges of Aging. Dementia, Grief, Depression, Isolation, Reconciliation.
Potential solutions
1. Encourage and teach the ageing population about lifestyle choices that are healthier, such as how to eat right, the long-term effects of alcohol and tobacco consumption and consistent exercise. Health promotion and disease prevention need to be widely adopted. This is necessary for preventing chronic diseases such as cardiovascular disease, obesity, diabetes, high blood pressure, arthritis, etc.
2. Provision of adequate long-term care by members of family or caregivers which can be either formal or informal. While through partnerships and sponsorships it is possible to provide formal long-term care facilities, this without a lot of money can only be provided to a select few, thus where possible it is necessary to encourage informal long-term care, as this is a lot easier to obtain than formal care. Family members need to be appropriately educated in order to provide care and identify any problems that require specific attention. By collaborating with hospitals, we can enlist nurses to provide families with the training they need to take care of their dependents.
3. Providing opportunities for engaging in a personally meaningful activity, allowing individuals who have self-esteem while respecting one’s self, others, and the environment.
4. A deterrent to the ageing population participating in society could be their physical environment. Access to transport and improvement in disability access in public places is necessary so that they can access not just services but be able to participate in social environments and enjoy a better quality of life.
5. It is also important that there is sufficient access to address mental health problems. A culture of prioritizing just physical ailments has led to an increased rate of depression, suicidal thoughts, anxiety and other mental health disorders amongst an ageing population, thus it is necessary to provide information on where access to appropriate healthcare can be obtained. Furthermore, drop-in sessions can be facilitated which provide advice to those in need.
6. Enhance the interaction with the person with Dementia, it is important to apply the Montessori principles Relate, Motivate, Appreciate.
7. Another aspect that needs to be addressed is an improvement of social needs for the ageing unemployed population. A significant portion of the ageing population is physically able to participate in society, thus it is possible to enrol them in volunteering activities. It enables them to be a productive member of society while being in a social environment where they can meet and interact with people from all walks of life.
8. The issue of ageism needs to be tackled by working with groups representing and working for the ageing population, by portraying realistic and positive images of the ageing population through media. This is necessary to tear down discriminatory practices and rebrand attitudes towards the older generation in Sri Lanka.
9. Cluster homes for senior citizens- The proposal is for a PPP to build low-cost homes built to ICTAD standards in clusters with central service facilities with each room and toilet costing less than SLR 500,000. The homes should be culturally and environmentally friendly with rooms (5-8 rooms around an inner courtyard with therapeutic gardening options). Philanthropists could lease land. The State may subsidies outright or in part the cost of building with options for the leasing of units by beneficiaries from Government and /or selling back units. Units could also be auctioned to beneficiaries with a ceiling on bidding. A percentage could be set aside to be given free to homeless poor, abandoned seniors due to past conflict. Beneficiaries /families could collectively determine service providers. The clusters could potentially be administered by cooperative societies for Government.
It would provide for home based rehab services to improve their functional status and/or minimize further deterioration, receive home palliative care in accordance to their wishes to achieve maximal quality of life during their last days at home, cared for through a person centred care approach, receive appropriate continence and bowel care that strives to promote independence where appropriate, receive routine assessment for pain and appropriate management to relieve suffering from pain, in a safe physical environment that minimises the risk of falls and injuries, and have access to equipment that enhances their safety depending on identified needs and risks.
10. Supporting active ageing of retir Senior Citizens from armed forces.
* Providing access to full time, part time and volunteer opportunities to deploy, skills, knowledge and experience through “Employment for Elders”) through a dedicated website.
* A Senior centre for self-help groups for fellowship (music, dance, yoga), options to order healthy food; use a library, psychological and mental support.
* Providing access to information on Physical Challenges of Aging including but not limited to -Functional Decline, Age-related Disease, Age-related.
Defence Secretary Kapila Waidyaratne through State Secretary Sunil Samaraweera a veteran on Social care has acted and moved on many fronts on this subject.
Extending the occupational life of Senior Citizens in Sri Lanka- letter DG Pensions
“We write with reference to our letter of December 21, 2016 addressed to S/PM and response of January 3, 2017 copies of which are appended for ease of reference in which we are for the expansion of the labour market to individuals from ages 55 to 70. We are currently developing a platform named Employment for Seniors (EFS) which primarily aims to connect mature job-seekers with potential job-providers, and mature volunteers with areas of need. Employers who wish to hire mature workers would post vacant positions within their organisations on the EFS system.
Individuals aged 50 years or older, and interested in employment, may register as a client at EFS by requesting an appointment. Clients would be scheduled to meet with qualified volunteer counsellors and receive referrals to the posted companies based on preference, ability and training experienced. Then, clients may contact an employer of their choice directly to apply for the position available.
Mature job-seekers would benefit through attaining guidance and support from a volunteer job counsellor; job referrals and advocacy of their skills to employers; an annual senior job fair featuring extensive career educational programmes and networking opportunities; workshops and resources which will aid in gaining employment, leading to financial stability.
We thus seek your support to:
• Jointly develop a flyer to share with all pensioners;
• Seek a mature group of Lead Volunteers to locate in 24 Districts to guide seniors.
• Enable pensioners who wish to register for the services offered through the platform.
• Seek your nominee to support guide this initiative.”
Would you like to respond DG pensions?
We have laboured long and hard to ensure our seniors remain in good physical and mental shape. We have knocked ceaselessly on many doors.
This article should show the length and breadth of detail and opportunities lay on the table. An MoU to ensure every single pensioner benefits and is able to access to options lies dormant at the Dept. of Pensions for months with no interest in moving it forward. It’s not good enough to send the monthly pension and stop doing so when the pensioner dies and is buried or cremated.
There is a duty to care beyond Mr DG Pensions. This applies equally to those at the Ministry of Health and Ministry of Social services whose delegated tasks for which they draw a month salary is the well-being of seniors. It might be useful to know the Government of Singapore has identified the number of seniors who will live single and those who need home visits along with the required human resources to services needs. Mr and Mrs Sri Lankan public servant, would you care to do likewise?
