The Committee on Public Enterprises (COPE) has begun an investigations into the bonds transaction from 2008-2015, based on the report submitted by the Auditor General.
COPE Chairman and JVP MP Sunil Handunnetti who met Speaker Karu Jayasuriya yesterday morning, had informed him that the Committee has begun investigations on previous instances of the bonds issued by the Central Bank for the last eight years from 2008. The Auditor General submitted a report consisting of an analysis on direct placement of government securities in the past eight years to the COPE Secretariat on January 17. The report was compiled following a request from Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayake.
MP Handunnetti, making a clarification on the accusation of Finance Minister Karunanayake that MP Bimal Rathnayake tabled the Auditor General’s report which should have been originally received by the minister, said the Auditor General had first submitted the report to the Finance Ministry on January 16. “A private secretary to the Minister had signed and received it on January 17. The AG has sent copies of the same report to the COPE and the CB Governor. I asked MP Bimal Rathnayake to get that report as I was out of the country,” Handunnetti said.
There is no govt. called TGTE in existence: Foreign Minister
 
The Government yesterday, insisted that there was no government in existence called the Transnational Government of Tamil Eelam(TGTE), but added that it was aware of a self-styled group of persons calling themselves TGTE.
This was stated by Foreign Affairs Minister Mangala Samaraweera to a question raised by Pivithuru Hela Urumaya Leader Udaya Gammanpila in Parliament yesterday. The minister stressed that no country, no government, no member state of the UN, no international organization or legal entity has recognized this self-styled group as a government or a government in exile.
Replying to a question by Gammanpila as to whether he admits that Australian and Denmark Governments have displayed the name of Tamil Eelam in their websites as a legitimate state, the minister said both countries took immediate action to rectify the error after it was brought to the attention of the relevant authorities.
“The Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS had listed ‘Tamil Eelam’ as a country classification on its website, which could be selected as the ‘country of birth’ for the Australian census of 2016. The High Commission of Sri Lanka in Australia, brought this to the attention of the Australian Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade on August 8, 2016. Following which, they took steps to remove ‘Tamil Eelam’ the very next day. The Chief of the ABS had written to Sri Lanka High Commission informing that ABS had never recognized Tamil Eelam as a country and assuring that the term will not appear in any data published from the census,” Samaraweera said.
He added the Australian Government in November 2016, extended the ban on the LTTE for a further period of three years.
“Tamil Eelam has been listed as a country eligible for Danish visas on Danish Immigration Service website in September 2016. The Danish Ministry of Foreign Affairs took immediate ‘high priority’ action to probe this and rectified what they termed as an ‘inadvertent error’ and ‘mistake made by the Danish Immigration’ on its website. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Denmark has also apologized on behalf of the Danish Government,” he explained.
The minister who was replying to supplementary questions of Gammanpila, said the TGTE is a self-styled group with no recognition similar to ‘Joint Opposition’ in Parliament. “The JO too is not legitimately recognized by Parliament. However, you are free to live in your own fantasies. This applies to both the TGTE and the JO,” he said.
New Bill to determine subjects coming under ministries: Ranil Wickremesinghe
Parliament should decide as to what the Committee of the House should receive reports from the Auditor General on the Treasury Bond issue during the past since 2008 and act accordingly, said Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe yesterday.
He made this observation in Parliament when the Finance Minister inquired as to how COPE received reports from the Auditor General direct and not those tabled in Parliament. He also said that the Auditor General has acted unprofessionally by failing to submit a report on past bond issues which was requested by him.
Premier Wickremesinghe further said that there were several committees in Parliament which dealt with financial matters. He added that there were several oversight committees in function that could deal with such matters. He suggested that Parliament decide as to which committee should deal with finances.The Premier also said that a new Bill would be presented in the House to determine the subjects that come under the ministries.
Possibility of holding O/L and A/L examinations in December to be looked into: PM
The possibility to hold both the Ordinary Level and the Advanced Level Examinations in December is being looked into, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said in Parliament yesterday.
He said the aim is to minimize the time the students have to idle after sitting the AL exam until university admission. The Prime Minister said if school holidays in December could be extended for a few more days and if the number of schools taken as examination centers are increased, this plan could be implemented.
He made this observation in response to a question raised by Chief Opposition Whip and JVP leader Anura Dissanayake under Standing Order 23 (2). The MP pointed out that students who sit for the AL exam, have to wait for about 18 - 20 months for university admission. He pointed out this long delay had caused many difficulties in filling the existing vacancies at State Universities.
The MP revealed that 698 vacancies exist at State universities with regard to the student enrollment in 2015. “Many students are waiting for university admission, but the UGC has failed to admit students to fill in the existing vacancies at the Universities. I request the Higher Education Minister to hold a meeting with all relevant parties including the UGC, Examinations Department and the Deans of Science Faculties to discuss a practical solution to minimize the delay in recruitment to State Universities. We too will attend discussions,” Dissanayake said.
Minister Kiriella admitting that there was a delay in the process, agreed to hold a discussion in this regard. The Prime Minister intervening at this point, said a mechanism to minimize the delay in university admissions was being looked at.
‘AG has never informed anybody he was forced by UNP members’
Speaker Karu Jayasuriya or the UNP leadership or the Chairman of COPE Committee had not been informed by the Auditor General that he had been forced by UNP Parliamentarians, said Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe in Parliament yesterday.
The Premier made this observation yesterday when JVP Parliamentarian Bimal Rathnayake stated that UNP Parliamentarians continued to threaten the Auditor General at the COPE Committee during his speech.
The Premier stated that the Speaker, himself as the leader of the UNP or the Parliament have not been informed by the Auditor General that he was threatened by UNP Parliamentarians. He added that Deputy Minister Harsha de Silva spoke on few f his foot notes in Parliament and it was a right of his.
The Premier further said that the Acts had been amended to finalize functions and the duties of the ministers. He added that a policy decision was taken to keep the Foreign Reserves Department, Central Bank and the Ministry that formulates the budget. He added that the same decision was taken since the previous government had taken loans from foreign reserves and the Central Bank and placed the country in jeopardy. He also said that according to the policy changes, the Finance Minister has powers to instruct the Central Bank on specified matters.
The Premier made this observation when Joint Opposition Parliamentarian Bandula Gunawardena said that according to the changes made under this government, the Finance Act and the Central Bank came under the purview of the Prime Minister not under the Finance Minister.
Responding to Bandula Gunawardena, Minister Karunanayake said that it was the Finance Minister who had been vested with the powers of implementing under the relevant Act.
JVP MP Anura Kumara Dissanayake said that Central Bank was under the Prime Minister and the Finance Act was under the Finance Minister and this has been the cause of issues. He added that there was unrest in the country over the Treasury Bond issue. "Therefore the need arose to inspect all Treasury bonds issuance in the past not only the recent one," MP Dissanayake said. "Accordingly, the Finance Minister sent for certain information with regard to bond sales. The Auditor General sent thee information to the COPE".
At this stage, the Premier said that there were provisions in the law enabling the Finance Minister to instruct the Central Bank on certain issues. "There is nothing wrong in investigating Treasury Bond sales from 2008," the Premier said. " What I said was that to investigate the Treasury Bond sales of 2015 first. If the rest was investigated first, the others would say that we did so to delay investigations on the recent issue. We needed to maintain transparency."
‘Audit Bill still being drafted’
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe observed that the Audit Bill was being drafted, adding that the Auditor General and the Finance Minister should sit together and make decisions with regard to the contents of the bill and then be presented to the Cabinet.The Premier made these observations in Parliament yesterday, in response to Opposition Member Dinesh Gunawardena's queries as to when the government would give powers to the Independent Audit Commission?
‘No reason to reveal sensitive details of Treasure Bond issuances’
There had not been any reason for the Auditor General to reveal the sensitive details of the Treasury Bond issuances to anybody else other than those who were entitled to, said Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe in Parliament yesterday.
He made these observations adding to what Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayake said that the Attorney General had instructed the Auditor General in writing on February 12, 2004, not to reveal sensitive matters of the Central Bank to anybody other than the Governor.
"There had been no need to reveal sensitive matters due to two reasons," said Premier Wickremesinghe. "First being that he had to report on the process and second being that he had said that he had no expert knowledge to access the loss incurred from the Treasury Bond issue."
At this stage JVP MP Bimal Rathnayake said that it was the same letter used to conceal the details of the Central Bank from Parliament.
