Common day to remember all war dead: Douglas

UPFA MP Douglas Devananda has proposed declaring a common day to commemorate the people who lost their lives due to the war and also to build a memorial to honour them. The MP has presented a private member’s motion in Parliament in this regard. He has proposed to declare an appropriate day to commemorate the people of all religions and nationalities that speak all languages who lost their lives due to the war and take measures to celebrate that day annually. The motion has further proposed to build a memorial in Omanthei in the Northern Province to honour their dedication, in the name of the motherland.
The memorial is intended to commemorate people of all religions, social levels and all nationalities that speak all languages who were killed due to the war and due to the anomalous conditions that prevailed during the recent past. The motion has been included in the Order Book through an Addendum published last Friday.
