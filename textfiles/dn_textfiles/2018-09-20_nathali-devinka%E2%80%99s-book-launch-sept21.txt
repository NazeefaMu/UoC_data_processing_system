Nathali Devinka’s book launch on Sept.21

Naked and Exposed is a journal of young Nathali Devinka’s personal experience on fighting mental illness and her battle of overcoming her condition.
Devinka is an aspiring film maker who has been in the constant struggle of fighting mental illness and has finally come forth with the hope of breaking the barrier of speaking on the open on mental health and to change the perception on those who suffer from mental health conditions.
She will be present at the Colombo International Book Fair 2018 and her book will be launched on the same day at the Bandaranaike Memorial International Conference Hall on September 21.
Naked and Exposed will be available for purchase at the Colombo International Book Fair and she is excited to continue her journey as a young author and a voice to those who are burdened with such stigma’s in the society across the world.
