Spinners Lakshan, Hasaranga bamboozle Zimbabwe to defeat

Zimbabwe who treated the Sri Lankan spinners with disdain to pull off a shock win in the first ODI on Friday were suddenly all at sea against two spinners whom they had never come up against Lakshan Sandakan who bowls left-arm chinaman and debutant Wanindu Hasaranga, right-arm leg break and googly prior to yesterday’s second ODI at the Galle International Stadium.

The result was more or less a foregone conclusion when Zimbabwe succumbed to 155 all out in 33.4 overs and Sri Lanka despite losing two early wickets cantered home to win by seven wickets with nearly 20 overs to spare and level the five-match series one-all.
It was a remarkable turnaround by Sri Lanka after being swept away two days ago by a team ranked lower than them. It was a test of their character and they came back fighting with flying colours.
Upul Tharanga followed his unbeaten knock of 79 on Friday with another sensible innings of 75 not out to add stability to the middle order after Danuskha Gunathilaka and Kusal Mendis had thrown their wickets away off successive balls playing indiscreet shots to Tendai Chatara making Sri Lanka 10-2.
Tharanga was involved in two half century stands with Niroshan Dickwella (35) and Angelo Mathews (28 not out) to completely seal the match in Sri Lanka’s favour.
Sandakan finished with career best figures of four for 52 off 10 overs and 19-year-old Hasaranga marked a memorable ODI debut by performing the hat-trick – only the third to achieve the feat after Taijul Islam of Bangladesh (v Zimbabwe 2014) and Kagiso Rabada of South Africa (v Bangladesh 2015) to end up taking three wickets for 15. He became Sri Lanka’s 180th ODI cricketer when he was presented his cap prior to the commencement of play by chief selector Sanath Jayasuriya.
Hasaranga who was brought onto bowl in the 26th over cleaned up the Zimbabwe tail by capturing the wickets of Malcolm Waller (bowled), Donald Tiripano (lbw) and Tendai Chatara (bowled) off successive deliveries.
The difference in Sri Lanka’s approach to yesterday’s game and the one played on Friday was that there was more intensity and purpose on the field by the players and they brought in Sandakan and Hasaranga to replace Akila Dananjaya and Amila Aponso who together had leaked 138 runs off 18 overs.
Sandakan especially presented a different threat to the Zimbabwean batsmen. The sweep and reverse sweep that Zimbabwe employed so successfully in the first ODI on Friday didn’t quite work out to plan as three of their top six in the order perished attempting to play it.
Sandakan who took the Man of the Match award was playing his first match after sitting out the entire Champions Trophy without a game and being forced to miss the first ODI due to ’flu. He made it a memorable one for him taking important wickets in the middle period to help Sri Lanka to level the series.
The Zimbabweans already baffled by Sandakan’s dexterity were further confounded by Hasaranga’s leg-spin and googlies as their batting crumbled under pressure.
Asela Gunaratne who has the knack of picking up wickets whenever he is brought on held a brilliant one handed return catch to send back the dangerous Hamilton Masakadza. That catch alone compensated for the three that were put down during the Zimbabwe innings. Masakadza was missed before he had scored by Kusal Mendis at slip off Lasith Malinga off the third ball of the match. Thankfully unlike in the first ODI it didn’t prove to be too costly.
Sri Lanka was lucky they finished the match as early as half past three because an hour later the heavens opened out and the rains came down heavily.
Both teams now travel to Hambantota for the remaining three ODIs commencing July 6.
