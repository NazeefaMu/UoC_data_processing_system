Two award winning sellout shows at Fairway GLF 2017

Two of the most electrifying events at the Fairway Galle Literary Festival this year are Luke Wright’s What I Learned from Johnny Bevan and Alison Wearing’s Confessions of a Fairy’s Daughter. Both shows represent a rare opportunity for Sri Lankan audiences to see truly world class theatre at a very reasonable prices, without having to go abroad to do so at exorbitant rates. Wright’s marvelous solo show had a sellout 3 week run in London’s West End. In it he delivers a multi award winning hurricane of a performance filled with humour and humanity that tells the story of a friendship between two men against the background of British politics.
Wearing’s play Confessions of a Fairy’s Daughter is based on her own life and brings to life the story of how she came to understand her father was gay and how she struggled to come to terms with this momentous discovery. This show that won numerous awards, including the CBC’s Outstanding Solo Show award and Best Dramatic Script at NYC’s United Solo, the largest festival of solo theatre in the world- is no polemic on LGBTQ issues. Rather, it is a comically touching coming- of -age story, and is visually and theatrically stunning because it weaves music and imagery into the story. Alison has done more than 100 performances of the show since its premiere in 2011 and she continues to tour the show to theatres and festivals across North America and around the world.
