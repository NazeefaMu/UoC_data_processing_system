Don’t act like hooligans, Speaker warns MPs Weerawansa, Ranaweera
Speaker Karu Jayasuriya strongly reprimanded Joint Opposition MPs Wimal Weerawansa and Prasanna Ranaweera in Parliament yesterday, over their unruly behaviour.
MP Weerawansa was seen leading the JO group in the Well of the House shouting slogans and hurling abuse at the Chair. Both Weerawansa and Ranaweera repeatedly defied the orders of the Speaker and behaved in an aggressive manner, pointing their fingers at the Speaker.
“You cannot threaten the Chair. I assure you that I will take appropriate action. Let me do that following the due procedure. I would like to remind MP Weerawansa that statements such as bombing or setting fire to Parliament had also been uttered in the past. We have to continue the day’s business as there is important legislation before the House. Weerawansa tried to play games. There has to be discipline in the House. If you continue to disturb the proceedings, I will have to name you. You spoke in filthy language and behaved in a very demeaning manner. This behaviour is a disgrace to the House,” the Speaker warned MP Weerawansa.
Miffed by repeated abuses hurled at him, the Speaker thoroughly warned MP Ranaweera, stating, “Be careful. You cannot act here as you did in at the Kelaniya PS. This is Parliament. Your behavior is like that of a hooligan, ” he said.
The Speaker came to a head when MP Ranaweera, who was repeatedly hurling abuse at the Speaker, tried to grab the Mace and run. The Serjeant-at-Arms Anil Parakrama Samarasekara, his Deputy and Assistant, prevented the MP from running away with the Mace. UNP members Thushara Indunil, Lucky Jayawardena and Nalin Bandara also rushed to the Well of the House and blocked MP Ranaweera. The Speaker at this point named MP Ranaweera and ordered him out of the House. As MP Ranaweera remained in the House, he ordered the Serjeant-at-Arms to remove him, but Parliament was adjourned before the order was executed.
MP Ven Rathana Thera also objecting to Vijayakala Maheshwaran’s statement, called on the Speaker to take serious action. He was seen approaching the Speaker’s chair and demanding for disciplinary action, to which the Speaker replied that he had already assured the House that he would hold an inquiry.
UGC suffered losses by investing in Treasury bonds - Grero
State Minister of Higher Education Mohan Lal Grero yesterday, confirmed that the University Grants Commission had suffered losses from investing the University Provident Fund in the questioned Treasury bond issuance on February 27, 2015.
Grero said that the losses were approximately Rs. 100 Million and further said that whoever was responsible in the matter must be brought to task.
He made these observations in answer to an oral question raised by JVP MP Dr. Nalinda Jayatissa, with regard to investments done by the University Grants Commission in the Central Bank Treasury bonds.
JVP MP Jayatissa also urged Parliament that a special investigation be carried out on investing University Provident Funds and the Mahapola Fund in Treasury bonds. He proposed that the Committee on Public Enterprises be permitted to carry out investigations. Jayatissa went on to say that the UGC had failed its academic and non-academic staff due to these losses incurred from investing in the questioned Treasury bonds. He also quoted a recent statement by Dr. Nirmal Ranjith Devasiri who had said that he had lost Rs. 1 Million due to these losses.
In answer to MP Jayatissa’s request, Grero said that he was in full agreement of such an investigation. “This matter is directly relevant to the Treasury bond scam investigation. So, an investigation on the misappropriation of these funds could also be linked to the main investigation,” Grero said.
Further, speaking on the matter, Grero pointed out that the matter was related to the Treasury bond issue which happened in 2015. The UGC investment was Rs. 1 Billion. With such irregularities that took place in the relevant bond issuance, the UGC had incurred losses around Rs. 100 Million. It is a gigantic loss. There is no argument that whoever was responsible for the losses, should be brought to task. There is always a risk in investment. We invest looking for profit, but sometimes we have to endure losses as well.
Following Grero’s answer, MP Wimal Weerawansa alleged that the former Higher Education Minister should be held responsible for the investment. According to Weerawansa, tha Higher Education Minister at that time was Minister Lakshman Kiriella. However, JVP MP Bimal Ratnayake rose to point out that in fact it was Minister Kabir Hashim who held the said portfolio.
Minister Kiriella in answer to Weerawansa’s allegation, said that the UGC had its funds in an NSB account, while that money was invested in Treasury bonds.
Meanwhile, in answer to JVP MP Dr. Nalinda Jayatissa’s initial question on the number of vacancies for lecturers serving in government medical faculties as at June 30, 2017, Grero said that there are 350 vacancies in the permanent cardre and 272 in temporary the cardre.
Grero also said that the Medical Faculty of the Moratuwa University would be opened in 2019. He also said that the government in a historic move was taking 160 medical students in to government universities in the years 2017/2018. Accordingly, 75 medical students would be taken into the new medical faculty in the Wayamba University and another 75 to the Sabaragamuwa University.
In relation to vacancies for lecturers, Grero pointed out that most lecturers only wished to work in universities closer to urban areas. He requested the lecturers to work in universities located in rural areas at least for one year. He also pointed out that lecturers are granted an extremely beneficial package including a 135% -140% academic allowance and vehicle permits for every five year.
Bill to amend Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters Act inconsistent with Constitution -SC
The Supreme Court (SC) has determined that two clauses of the Bill to amend Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters Act are inconsistent with the Constitution, Speaker Karu Jayasuriya told Parliament yesterday.
The Speaker, making an announcement at the commencement of sittings, said the SC in its determination sent to Parliament after concluding the hearing of petitions challenging the Bill, has stated that Clause 5(3) and 5A are inconsistent with the Constitution.
The SC had ruled that the Bill either had to be passed with a two thirds majority in Parliament, or be amended as per SC’s recommendations to make it consistent with the Constitution.
The Bill was presented for First Reading in Parliament on June 5. The Bill broadens the scope of the Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters Act to include tracing of crimes committed via internet, information communications technology, cloud computing, blockchain technology and the trading in of any digital currencies.
The Act provides for combating transnational crimes and strengthening the prevention of crimes. The amendment had included new sections to provide for the facilitation of video conferencing technology and joint investigations for the above purposes.
The Bill had expanded the grounds of refusing assistance by including instances where the criminal investigations or proceedings have commenced in Sri Lanka. It has provided provisions to expedite the process of taking evidence or receiving documents or articles for investigations.
A new part had been added the Act, to provide for the assistance in relation to findings of bribery of foreign public officials or officials of public international organizations.
NIE higher education qualifications to teachers from training colleges
The National Institute of Education (NIE) will take necessary steps to grant higher education qualifications to teachers who pass out from teacher training colleges, Education Minister Akila Viraj Kariyawasam said.
“They will not only able to receive a degree level qualification, but also they can study until post graduate level,” Minister Kariyawasam said.
Minister Kariyawasam also said that 2100 applicants have been interviewed for schools in the estate sector.
He agreed that there is a shortage of Science and Maths teachers in government schools.
“We have called for vacancies but the number of applicants is a minimum. We may have to find other options to solve this issue,” he said.
Former Minister Dayasiri Jayasekara questioned Minister Kariyawasam on the cancellation of an allowance granted for Acting Principals.
Minister Kariyawasam pointed out there are many political appointments in the Acting Principals category.
“Because of them we are not able to appoint the officers in the Sri Lankan Principal Service who were selected through a government examination. We were able to appoint only 500 of the selected 4000 Principals. If we give the Acting Principals another allowance, they will never leave their posts.” Minister Kariyawasam pointed out.
Minister Kariyawasam also said that the government has instructed to give the Acting Principals, Deputy Principal post when they leave their present post.
