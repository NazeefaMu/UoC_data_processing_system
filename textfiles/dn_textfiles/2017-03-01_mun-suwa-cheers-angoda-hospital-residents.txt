Mun Suwa cheers the Angoda hospital residents

Moving away from their usual public entertainment presentations, the Moratuwa Arts Forum inaugurated ‘Mun Suwa’ the Corporate Social Responsibility Arm and as the first Project they chose to entertain the patients and the Staff to a repertoire of quality soothing and entertaining music at the Mental Hospital Angoda. Nalaka de Soysa and Ranjith Peiris of Magic Seeya fame formed the ensemble supported by a few veteran Musicians to provide the music. The best of yesteryear’s old favourite songs were used for the entertainment.
Mun Suwa is a novel concept of the incumbent President of ‘Moratuwa Arts Forum to promote Body Mind and Soul of individuals through meaningful entertainment to Charitable Organizations by making use of the skills and talents of members of Moratuwa Arts Forum.
They are contemplating in amending the constitution to accommodate well wishers to join hands in such Social Responsibility projects Lakdas Fernando a dynamic social worker is due to function as Secretary while Laksiri Fernando and Suranga Fernando will attend to finances. Moratuwa Kala Rangahala, a hall for the Moratuwa community, will also be built to hold musical and variety shows. Therefore they are looking out for a generous donor philanthropist to take it up as a service for the people of Moratuwa and Moratuwa Arts Forum would take the burden of taking care and maintaining the Kala Rangahala once built.
