Violation of labour laws: ILO and UN will act

The International Labour Organisation (ILO) and the United Nations (UN) will take action against the government if it has violated labour laws in connection with trade unions, Labour and Trade Union Relations Minister W.D.J.Seneviratne said.
Minister Seneviratne made this observation when he met the officials of the Government Medical Officers' Association (GMOA) recently.
The minister said registered trade unions can complain to the ILO and UN if they are not satisfied with the measures taken by the Labour and Trade Union Relations Ministry. The ministry is ready to discuss any issue with any trade union and bring the issue to the government's attention. The ministry will study the case and inform court about possible violation of trade union rights. The government is liable to protect the rights of the trade unions according to International Conventions/ treaties, he said.
The GMOA complained to the Labour and Trade Union Relations Ministry in connection with the Health Minister's May Day Rally speech which allegedly included threats to trade unions and legal action against GMOA President in connection with a speech he made during a trade union rally.
