Ayurveda Corporation management should heed to employees demands: Rajitha

The profit earned by the Ayurveda Corporation has increased by 66 percent. The salaries of the employees should be increased as the corporation registered a profit of Rs. 1.2 billion last year, Health Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne said.
Minister Senaratne made these observations during a recent inspection tour of the Ayurveda Corporation.
The minister said the profit will go up by another 15 percent this year. The corporation had paid Rs. 100 million to the Treasury as tax.
He said the profit of the corporation has increased significantly after reducing the prices of 48 drugs. More people visit the corporation and its outlets to buy drugs, he said.
Minister Senaratne said the management of the corporation should accept the demands of the employees. The Minister handed over appointment letters to 76 new recruits during the inspection tour.
