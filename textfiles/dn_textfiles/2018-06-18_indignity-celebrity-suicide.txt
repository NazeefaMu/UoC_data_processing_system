The Indignity of Celebrity Suicide

The day we learn Kate Spade took her life we are in Rivella, Italy, a small town on the Amalfi Coast—it finds us even in this small corner of the world, stamped on the front page of the International Times and in international papers that line the table where we breakfast.
The reporting is invasive and crude. Lines from Kate Spade’s suicide note, the last words to her daughter are printed worldwide. Speculation and implication of marital troubles at the bottom of it. Next news cycle. Kate Spade’s sister speaks out, saying that she was not surprised; Kate had suffered from bipolar depression but was afraid to get treatment lest the news break out. A life comes to a tragic end reduced by simplistic statements.
Naval use
After breakfast, our plan is to tour the Villa Cimbrone. In Roman times, the brochure of the walking tour tells us, Villa Cimbrone was an agricultural estate that produced timber for naval use. At the end of the nineteenth century it was abandoned and later rediscovered by an English traveler, Ernest William Beckett, Lord Grimthorpe. He was a member of the group of intellectuals who made the grand tour to Ravello. His personal mission was to recuperate from a deep depression after the death of his beloved wife. The beauty of the estate, the joy it brought, led him to buy it in 1904, to restore it and transform it into his own artful creation. The estate became an elegy to his lost wife; a place where he could honor his grief and preserve her memory with its austere beauty. Carved into the wall of a stone bench are these words:
LOST TO A WORLD IN WHICH I CRAVE NO PART
I SIT ALONE AND COMMUNE WITH MY HEART
PLEASED WITH MY LITTLE CORNER OF THE EARTH
GLAD THAT I CAME NOT SORRY TO DEPART.
I’m drunk by the overpowering scent of flowers in the many gardens, along trellises and walls, by the views of the lemon groves and the Mediterranean, dust from the antiquated stones and walkways, by the history of this place embedded in every stone and wall and the ghosts of suicides that in this particular moment are unleashed.
Marble busts
We walk along a path called the Avenue of Immensity. In different parts of the estate are statues of the Greek and Roman gods, Cere, Mercury, Diana, and the Temple of Bacchus, where Lord Grimthorpe requested his own ashes be buried. We follow the map to the the Terrace of Infinity that overlooks the expansive sea. It is lined with eighteenth-century marble busts and from here you can see the coast of Amalfi, the past and the present colliding in its majesty. This is where the sea and the sky feel all of one, where heaven and hell might meet. No better place to honor the dead.
Two days later, we are in Rome, having awoken to the news of Anthony Bourdain’s suicide. Because I am a writer and an editor, my newsfeed is filled with remembrances from chefs, journalists, editors and writers; the owner of the deli counter Bourdain frequented has left a seat empty for him with his usual breakfast order of scrambled eggs and Nova Scotia lox, Anderson Cooper is reduced to tears on CNN. Universal mourning for a man who brought the world to his viewers through his television show about his travels to remote places, Parts Unknown, a title that takes on a deeper resonance after the news of his death. And still, the airways reverberate with one thought: Why?
Spanish steps
We are only in Rome for a day. Our mission is to go to the Trevi Fountain, the Pantheon and then the Spanish Steps. As we enter the square of the Spanish Steps my eye catches on a plaque, THE KEATS-SHELLEY MEMORIAL HOUSE. I knew that the house was in Rome, but I hadn’t thought about it on this trip. We ditch the massive crowd at the Spanish Steps and walk up the stairs to the second floor of the house. It’s in the foreigner’s quarter of Piazza di Spagna. This is the house where Keats and his friend and painter Joseph Severn found rooms in November 1820, Keats at the last stages of tuberculosis. When he grew too ill to leave his room, the view from his window was, according to The Keats-Shelley House: A Guide, a “constant distraction and delight.”
We enter Keats’s room, where this great poet spent the remaining days of his life at the age of twenty-five. He died on February 23, 1821. Narrow and long, its walls are painted the beautiful blue of the shutters that line many of the windows along the streets of Rome.
Against one wall is a narrow boat bed, once called a fainting couch, and a bureau and a chair where Severn sat to nurse Keats as he passed. These were his last words to Severn: “Lift me up for I am dying—I shall die easy—don’t be frightened—thank God it has come.”
We look at the letters and snippets of poems preserved under glass at the museum, the living mask and the death mask taken of Keats after his death. In one of the letters are these words from Severn to Charles Brown, another close mutual friend of his and Keats’s, dated December 17, 1820.
