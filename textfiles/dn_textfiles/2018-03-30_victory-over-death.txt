Victory  over death

‘It is finished’; and he bowed his head and handed over his spirit.”
Those of you who sat in theaters or rented the movie and watched from home `The Passion of the Christ’ surely would have been horrified by the beatings, the blood and the hanging on the cross, but the Mel Gibson film was still a softer version of the actual torture and torment that Jesus endured on Good Friday.
According to research the weapons used in the beatings, the number of lashes on the body of Jesus, and other methods of torture used by his assailants, the face of Jesus would have been unrecognizable and by the time Jesus was nailed to the cross his wounds revealed bone.
Few would have survived the original beatings but Jesus was set on doing the will of his heavenly Father. There was nothing, and no one, who could have stopped him from becoming the sinless sacrifice, and performing the greatest act of love on behalf of the entire human race.
It’s difficult to visualize Christ, the Son of God, the Lord and Saviour of the world, bleeding profusely and being mocked by the crowd as he walked toward Calvary on Good Friday. Jesus took on the sins of thieves, of molesters and schemers, every sin of every man, woman and child on earth which was a load no mortal man could ever carry.
This yearly celebration of the passion, death and resurrection of Christ has been kept in the church since earliest times. Originally the celebration lasted only three days, which now correspond to Good Friday, Holy Saturday and Easter Sunday. Soon it was extended to a whole week which we call Holy week. Later the church established a time of preparation for Easter, the time we call Lent. The time of Lent was intended to be a period of preparation for baptism and for Easter celebration while for those who are already baptized had to repent for the sins. Praying more assiduously, doing penance and helping our neighbours in need, have been considered the best ways of sharing in the passion and death of Jesus Christ. For a long time abstinence was considered the best way of doing penance but as the circumstances in the world changed, the Church does not impose it any longer as a command except on Ash Wednesday and Good Friday.
On Good Friday, the entire Church fixes her gaze on the Cross at Calvary as we try to understand how Christ has won our redemption. In the solemn ceremonies of Good Friday, in the Adoration of the Cross, in the reading of the Passion, and in receiving the pre-consecrated Host, we unite ourselves to our Saviour.
The Church will strip of its ornaments, the altar bare, and with the door of the empty tabernacle standing open. No Mass is celebrated on this day, but the service of Good Friday is called the Mass of the pre-sanctified because Communion which had already been consecrated on Holy Thursday is given to the people. Traditionally, the organ is silent from Holy Thursday until the Alleluia at the Easter Vigil, as are all bells or other instruments, the only music during this period being unaccompanied chant. The desolate quality of the rites of this day reminds us of Christ’s humiliation and suffering during his Passion.
However the bleakness of Good Friday does not remain as Christians move on to the resurrection of Jesus. After travelling with the Christ through this Lent and His passion and death, we arrive at new life. Death is not an ending but is a new beginning. Because of Christ’s victory over death, the grave is not final. We naturally will feel sorrow and grief when those we love die and we are separated from them in this life. But the believer will know one day all will be taken from their graves to be clothed with glorified resurrected bodies.
The resurrection is celebrated on the most famous vigil in the year Easter –called the Paschal Vigil. Christians took the name and even the date of this feast from `Passover’ feast of the Jews. For Christians it has a deeper meaning than it does for Jews. For Jews the passing over meant passing along of the angel of Yahweh in Egypt, who by passing the houses of Israelites killed the first born of the Egyptian families thus setting free the people of Israel from the slavery of Pharaoh.
For Christians it is about passing from Christ’s death to life through His resurrection. It is the passing of each Christian from the death of sin to a new life in Christ. For many years Easter was the only feast for the early Christians. Easter continues to be the centre of the year of worship, just as the resurrection of Jesus will always be the pillar on which the Christian faith rests.
As birds chirp, flowers start to pop up from the ground and trees get green, the world comes alive again after a long and cold winter and this is the perfect time to celebrate the new life we received through Christ.
