[APPRECIATIONS - (18-12-2017)]

Francis Amerasinghe
Cordial personality
It has been fifty years since the demise of Francis Amerasinghe. His parents, late Mudaliyar Arthur Amerasinghe and late Harriet Sirimanne, hailed from Unawatuna, Galle.
Since his parents wished to give their son a good education, they moved to Colombo and lived in de Alwis Place, Dehiwala, and Francis was admitted to St. Thomas’ College, Mt. Lavinia. Francis Amerasinghe completed his education, excelling in academic studies, as well as sports.
He was the Senior Head Prefect in 1933. At cricket, he had an unbeaten record for the 2nd wicket partnership with the late N. A. D. S. Wijesekera at a first eleven Royal-Thomian encounter and was considered a stylish batsman. He was the captain of cricket, football, and athletics and represented the college in every branch of sports. A keen tennis player, he continued playing tennis even when he was working at the Bank of Ceylon, and would travel to England to see tennis matches in Wimbledon.
He joined the Bank of Ceylon from its inception on August 1, 1939 and became the chief accountant in 1949. When the Galle Branch of the Bank of Ceylon was declared opened on December 14, 1942, he was appointed as the first manager of the branch. During that period, the general manager of the Bank of Ceylon was the late J. H. Mortlock. He was the first Manager of the Bank of Ceylon Trincomalee from its inception and later the Manager Bank of Ceylon Kandy. From the time the Bank of Ceylon Sports Club was formed, he was an active member where many tournaments were conducted.
He was instrumental in introducing the Widows' and Orphans' Pension Scheme to the Bank of Ceylon, and his wife, Malini Amarasinghe, was its first member in the number one position.
His sports background and cordial personality helped him in his professional work and social service, when he was involved with community work in Dehiwala. The Dehiwala-Mt.Lavinia Cosmopolitan Sports Club was his brainchild. It was started in a cadjan shed, and he was the first president of the club from 1959 to 1967. During that period, the honourary committee members were late Sir John Kotalawala, then Police Inspector General late Aleric Abeygunawardena, then Deputy Mayor late G. D. Perera, to name a few. At present, the Dehiwala-Mt.Lavinia Sports Club has been taken over by the Municipality.
He passed away on October 15, 1967, after a brief illness, whilst in service as the Bank of Ceylon Head Office deputy general manager. May he attain the supreme bliss of Nirvana.

Joy Gnanadurai
Teacher par excellence
Joy Gnanadurai answered her call, when her roll was called up yonder on November 30, 2017. She was born on July 16, 1946, to James Ratnam Williams Jayaratnam and Joyce Jeyamani Chelliah.
Joy was a student of Chundikuli Girls’ College, Jaffna. Her passion for music started early during her school days. She was quick to get through all the music exams of Trinity College of Music, which was the only foreign exam for western music at that time in Jaffna.
Soon, she joined her school and church choirs. Due to her ability and experience in this field, she became the choir leader and started conducting choral festivals in Jaffna.
Her family were all musicians and it was a treat to watch them ‘harmonize’ in singing during family functions.
Joy married Richard Gnanadurai on September 20, 1975. They were blessed with a son, Dhilan, who carried the batton from his mother and is now a musician in the UK, training opera singers, church choirs, and also conducting music classes.
After the war in 1990, their family moved to Colombo. Joy continued her career in music, teaching music, conducting choirs, as well as being a church organist for Holy Trinity Church, Wellawatte; St Paul’s Church, Milagriya, and a few other churches in Colombo.
Whenever she was requested to play for special functions, she always readily obliged and said “It was for the Glory of God.” My children were sent to Joy for their music lessons.
I can proudly say that one of my children won the All-Island Prize at the Trinity College of Music examination, all due to Joy’s untiring efforts.
This proved beyond any doubt that she was a professional. She took pride in her profession and was a teacher par excellence.
I had no choice but to send my grandchild to Joy for piano lessons as well.
Some of her brothers have already gone beyond the veil, namely Dr. Joe, Fredrick, and Festus. She leaves behind her husband, Richie; son Dilan; daughter-in-law, Sabeenaand, and siblings Gerald, Anton, Dharman, Grace, Yoges, and Ruby.
Now, Joy must be singing It is well with my soul with the Lord. May she Rest in Peace and Rise in Glory.

M. A. Hemachandra
An exemplary character
The harsh sun rays were fading on the eve of November 1, 2017, at the Dadalla crematorium grounds. The cremation of M. A.Hemachandra took place there amidst a distinguished large gathering, in a melancholic atmosphere.
Born to a respectable family in the village of Mampitiya in the close vicinity of Galle town, he was born in 1945 as the eldest son of a family of the five brothers and one sister.
He studied at the Karandeniya central college and excelled in his studies, passing the Ordinary Level exam with distinctions.
Even though he was studious, circumstances prevented him from higher studies. He then decided to go for an employment of his own wish.
In the year 1963, Hemachandra joined the People's Bank, and within a short spell of time, rose to many higher positions.
He excelled in all the competitive examinations conducted by the bank and topped all exams. He had no intention of aspiring for higher positions in the bank due to personal reasons.
All his younger brothers are well-educated and holding responsible posts in the sphere of education and other essential services.
His paternal affection to all his siblings was regarded with high-esteem and appreciation by his family.
He was a devout Buddhist, exemplary character, honest and dedicated banker, and a sincere and true friend. May he attain the Supreme Bliss of Nibbana.
May these few lines be a floral tribute to our long and sincere friendship.
Though you are no longer with us
We will always remember you forever
Sweet memories are treasured within our hearts
So precious and special to us, you are
We will remember you with love
Unforgettable and irreplaceable
Ivan Gunawardana,
Galle
Kalyani de Zoysa
A courageous woman
Kalyani de Zoysa, the second principal of Devi Balika Vidyalaya departed recently at the age of 93 years, leaving a vacuum in the hearts of all those associated with the school. She was one of the first five teachers at its inception.
The young students found in her not only a dedicated teacher, but also a friend who could give a solution to any of their problems.
When young mischief makers had their way once in a while, their teacher, Abeysiriwardhana, was moved to tears instead of resorting to punishment.
Perhaps she was not aware that her tears were far more effective than any imaginable punishment in disciplining girls.
Later, as a Principal, the trust and confidence she had placed in the teaching staff and the non-academic team, worked wonders. Teachers willingly undertook any additional work allocated, in order to relieve their warm-hearted principal of her burden.
From the start, in 1953, the school was on a forward march to reach its ideals, and Kalyani de Zoysa contributed her might in reaching it faster. When Devi became one of the most sought-after schools in the city, it gladdened everybody except the principal. She stood firm on the rules of admission, as instructed by the Education Ministry, in spite of the stress on her, when the then President himself requested her to overlook the rules with regard to a particular student.
In the face of questionings at a meeting with the President, she stood her ground, unmoved. Ultimately, the political powers had to give in.
On some occasions, the printed media, with all its high light tactics and humiliation, could not set sweep the principal off her feet.
Perhaps she dedicated her life for the welfare of thousands of young girls at Devi, more than for her own three children. Even after retirement, she was always present at school functions.
Past Devians and Devi teachers were always welcome at her residence.
She befriended and gave inspiration to all the subsequent Devi principals, who were also bent on reaching the top and maintaining it.
She was an exemplary character, simple in dress, kind in temperament, soft-spoken and ready to help everybody, in whatever way possible. She organised a scholarship programme for orphaned children of the Forces. She also lent a hand to assist the deserving Devians who went up for higher studies.
She displayed courage at the bereavement of her son because, as she explained to others, “change is the unchangeable reality in life. You have to face it unmoved.”
Devi Balika Vidyalaya is ever grateful to de Zoysa for her dedication in moulding the lives of thousands of young girls and proud to be associated with a woman of such calibre.

Gerard Gunasekera
He had a pure heart
Gerard Palitha Gunasekera was born on the December 13, 1961, being the eighth out of nine siblings. His father was a Major in the Sri Lanka Army whilst his mother was a housewife. Palitha was enrolled at St. Benedict's College, Kotahena, since the school was in close proximity to their home. His entire school career was spent at St. Benedict's, where he made numerous friends with a majority of them remaining as lifelong buddies.
By nature, Palitha was an easygoing, fun-loving individual with an infectious smile. But his greatest asset was the pure, genuine heart he possessed. Also, his leadership qualities, along with his honesty and integrity, were formidable strengths he possessed. He was always looking to lend a helping hand to others—including people who he met for the very first time.
Palitha owned a unique personality that attracted people whenever and wherever he met them. He also had the rare ability to win over even strangers of all ages and walks of life with his charming smile, as well as his pleasant and kind words. People who met this charismatic person for the first time became friends overnight with him.
While still at school, Palitha decided to join the Colombo YMCA—one of the most important decisions he made in his life. His leadership qualities blossomed at the YMCA Youth Department. He persuaded some of his schoolmates to join as well, and along with their membership, Palitha started a host of new programmes and activities that attracted more youth to the YMCA. He rapidly climbed the ladder and was promoted as the youth work secretary. It was an early testament to his people-handling skills.
In the year 1986, Palitha formed Friends—an organisation to support the underprivileged youth in Sri Lanka, to overcome their many social barriers. It targeted the financially-insecure school-going children deprived of parental love and care, and living in centres run by the government and private sectors. Even today, more than 30 years after the inauguration, Friends continues to positively impact the lives of the disadvantaged youth of Sri Lanka, due largely to the vision of this remarkable individual called Palitha Gunasekera.
Palitha took another important decision—this time to settle down in Australia. Based in Sydney, he initially worked in the banking sector and later ended up employed in the government Railway. Although he became an Australia citizen, Palitha was also the proud holder of dual citizenship of Sri Lanka. With the backing of his Sri Lankan colleagues, Palitha formed the first ever overseas branch of Friends in Sydney, in the year 2000.
From time to time, he used to visit his motherland and renew old friendships. But he never forgot Friends and its beneficiaries—the disadvantaged kids. With the loyal support of his most trusted friends and colleagues back in Sri Lanka, he revived Friends in the year 2008 by holding a three-day residential camp for over a 100 children. The success of this venture made him change his mind and return to Sri Lanka for longer stays thereafter.
In the ensuing years, many new members joined Friends, and in the year 2014, Palitha was instrumental in organising a memorable charity dinner dance in Sydney to raise funds. The record turnout and financial profits at this event made Palitha the happiest individual that night.
Palitha's love and affection for disadvantaged kids was limitless. He aspired to be a father figure and a friend to every child he came across, and his generous heart, smiling eyes, and encouraging words made them happy.
We can learn many things by looking at his life. One of them is punctuality, and the other is always to honour a promise. His commitment towards achieving a goal, loyalty to friends, and generosity and willingness to help the needy, were sterling qualities very rare in an individual.
Although Palitha was a devout Catholic, he enjoyed learning and respecting other religions and cultural traditions as well.
During the last few years of his life, he travelled to most parts of Sri Lanka and experienced conditions and situations as never before. He became an avid nature lover and enjoyed outdoor life and visits to wild life and nature parks. He gradually got accustomed to the ground realities and challenges of day-to-day living.
Palitha's love and affection for his mother was unlimited. During the final few years, it was the main, as well as the only reason he went back to Australia at least once a year. And during winter, a few years back, he took care of her for six months at his home in Sri Lanka. He had a lot of plans for her future well-being, but most unfortunately, they could not be fulfilled.
It is very rarely in one's life that they come across a human being of exceptional and rare qualities. Those who were fortunate enough to associate closely with Palitha can count themselves lucky. He was a man of vision and a provider to those in need. He was also a great planner and a perfectionist. The one thing he enjoyed most was making others happy. An utterly unselfish and a generous individual, Palitha loved good company, and his friends were always welcome at his home. He was blessed with a beautiful heart that attracted people of all ages and walks of life wherever he happened to be.
The greatest respect we can pay Palitha is continuing to engage in the good deeds he did. His legacy has to be carried forward. It is the least we, as a grateful public, including friends and colleagues, could do.
Gerard Palitha Gunasekera left this world for good on the September 4, 2016, in Sydney.
Friends will be dedicating the 13th Senehasa Youth Leadership Camp for disadvantaged youth from December 15 to 17, 2017 at Lama Sevana Childrens Home, Halpathota, Baddegama, to the late founder.
