One-day games produced good cricket

The three one-day school games played between traditional rivals last weekend all produced good cricket.
Sylvestrians pocket the Mediwake trophy
Much was expected from Vidyartha College like in the big match but they failed at Asgiriya. Batting first they were bundled out for 130 runs in 42.2 overs. Chathuranga Dilsha did well to score 30 runs and Dunidu Imasha 20, Pasan Hettiarachchi bowled to a good line and length to take 3 for 25¸and there was two wickets each from Nimsara Attanagalla and Nadeera Balasuriya.
Sylvestrians, too started badly but managed to reach their target scoring 131 for 5 in 25 overs to win the match and the Nilagoda/Mediwake trophy.
Nirmalan Pavithran who scored a century in the big match scored an unbeaten 50 in 49 balls Nimsara Attangalla too did well with an unbeaten 35, Sanjaya Seneviratne took 2 for 18.
Trinity win Richard Aluwihare trophy
Hasitha’s Boyagoda’s spectacular hundred and superb all-round performance helped Trinity to a five-wicket victory over St Anthony’s at Katugastota. The Antonians suffered one of their worst one day slumps since this one day was introduced being dismissed for 156 to hand to Trinity a 149-run win. Most of the cricket loving Antonians indicated that players needed to take responsibility for their poor performance. The cricket presented by the Antonians was not in the correct format. They did not play well, they failed to put it all together on the one day and there has been something lacking. In the two day games they did extremely well to win six games.
In this 38th one dayer much was expected from the Antonians at their home venue but they were rattled by Boyagoda’s brilliance. Trinity raced to 305-7 in 50 overs with Boyagoda contributing 109 off 111 balls with 12 fours and four sixes. Thisaru Dilshan too did well with the bat to score an unbeaten 47, Hasintha Jayasooriya scored 41, Ashok Kumara 46 and Pubudu Bandara 29. Off-spinner Kalhara Senaratne was the only bowler to do well to take 4 for 47.
St. Anthony's in their turn failed to do well, at their own den and were bowled out for 156 in 41 overs. Navodya Vijekuma made 37 and Kalhara Senaratne 31. Ruvin Peris, Hasith Boyagoda and Kavinshka Senadheera took two wickets apiece. It was Trinity’s 18th win of the series out of 38 games.
At the end Trinity’s match winning captain was presented with the man of the match and best batsman’s award, Antonian Kalhara Seneviratne won the best bowler’s award and Thisaru Dilshan the best fielder.
Rajans win Winston Hoole trophy by 5 runs
Dharmaraja College who won the toss and batted first in the annual one-day game against Kingwood College piled up 214-7 in 50 overs with Dulaj Bandara contributing 67 and Mathjila Gayeshan 31. Placeman Utpala Jayalath took 3 for 40 and off-spinner Saumaya Piyasena 2 for 48.
Kingswood College were never really in touch and were dismissed for 209 runs in 48.1 overs. Ganidu Kaushalya made 33, Hashika Gamage 29 and Deegaye Bandara was not out on 25. Navindu Dilshan, Yasitha Samararatne and Upendera Warnakulasuriya took two wickets each.
60th Battle of the Babes a draw again

Sylvestrians who won the toss and invited Vidyartha to bat dismissed them for 229 runs in 74 overs. Pulina Gunathilake scored a century. Kasun Karunathilake and Gihan Jayasekara were able to score 28 runs each. In bowling Nadeera Balasuriya and Husindu Nissanka took 3 wickets each.
Sylvestrians in their turn went on to score 300 for 6 in 84.5 overs. Manoharan Pavithran scored a superb century and Pasan Hettiarachchi 88. Nimsara Atharagalla was the most successful bowler to take 3 wickets for 53 runs.
