Clifford Cup Quarter-finals: Sashan Mohamed’s superb try for CR stuns Airmen 36-33

A breathtaking try scored by full back Sashan Mohamed just before the final whistle enabled CR & FC to book a semi-final berth with Kandy SC by beating a fighting Air Force outfit by 36 points (5 tries, 4 conversions, 1 penalty) to 33 (5 tries, 4 conversions) in their inter-club Dialog ‘A’ Division Clifford Cup knock-out rugby quarterfinal match played at Race Course grounds, Reid Avenue yesterday. The winners led 17-12 at half time.
CR once again dished out a superb brand of running rugby and gave a hectic time to Air Force with their three quarters through their reinstated coach M.J.M. Mushtaq. They dominated right throughout the entire match and this really made the difference for the Red shirts to win. Their entire three quarters showed their superiority by scoring four out of the five tries scored in the match.
CR & FC’s tries were scored by Kavindu Perera, Panduka Angammana, Nalin Kumara, Anuradha Herath and Sasahan Mohamed. Nalin Kumara (three) and Kavindu de Costa (one) made the conversions with Nalin Kumara putting over the solitary penalty.
Skipper Gayantha Iddamalgoda (three), Supun Madushan (one) and Vinod Anjana (one) scored the tries for the Airmen. Iddamalgoda also made four conversions.
Referee: Priyantha Gunaratne
