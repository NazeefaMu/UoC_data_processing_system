Joint Oppn. on a journey of hypocrisy: Kiriella

 
A party should be formed with certain principles and a clear vision, if not there is no survival, Higher Education and Highways Minister Lakshman Kiriella said. He said the Joint Opposition had no such vision and were embarking instead on a political journey of hypocrisy.
He was speaking during the inauguration of the First Stage of the Rural Road Development Project in the Galagedara Electorate of the Kandy District on Sunday, which intends to develop the Alagalla-Pattapola, Weligodapola-Dedunuptiya, Alotuwa-Ihalagama and Aludeniya-Paragoda roads, at an estimated cost of Rs. 480 million.
The minister said the Joint Opposition led by former President Mahinda Rajapaksa is not the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) that it was once known to be, and had instead become extremist.
"Back in the day, the Sri Lanka Freedom Party had three Secretaries-General; a Sinhalese, a Tamil and a Muslim. It was a Party based on central principles and policies. Today there is no Opposition," he said.
He said the former President had handed out limitless ministerial and deputy ministerial portfolios during the previous regime, but the19th Amendment had limited this practice.
"Although the Opposition MPs shout at us in Parliament, during the lunch break they ask us if they could join the Government. If we were able to give ministerial portfolios to the remaining 45 MPs in the Opposition, there would only be about 10 remaining in the Opposition," he said.
“The latest charade carried out by the Joint Opposition is breaking coconuts for the Gods to fulfill their wishes. These acts should be carried out by virtuous people, not the people who put General Sarath Fonseka behind bars, deposed the Chief Justice Shirani Bandaranayaka and introduced the white van culture. Even the gods were angered by this deed, which is why the wallet of a MP was lost during the ceremony," he said.
