Atalugama murder case: Death sentence on three accused

Panadura Provincial High Court Judge Padmini Ranawaka Gunathileke imposed death sentence on first, second and third accused of the Bandaragama Atalugama murder case yesterday.
The accused were found guilty of committing the murder of Mohammed Maharoof Mohammed Isadean of Atalugama Bandaragama on November 17, 2005.
The Attorney General had indicted seven accused for killing the man by attacking him with swords following an argument.
The 4th, 5th, 6th and 7th accused were acquitted as the prosecution had not proved the indictments against them without reasonable doubt.
The death sentence was passed on Mohammed Lebbe Mohammed Sakariya alias Sakriya Mudalalee Mohammed Jamaldean, Mohammed Nasim Mohommed Zarook and Mohammed Iqbal of Atalugama.
