National Eye Hospital patients in jeopardy

The patients who visit Colombo National Eye Hospital for cataract surgeries and lens transplant surgeries, face difficulties due to non-availability of free lenses and machines used to do cataract surgeries. Doctors do not give prescriptions to buy spectacles from the private sector, patients said.
According to patients, the hospital authorities send them back when they turned up for surgeries.
Only six eye lenses were available for hundreds of patients last Friday. Lens transplant surgeries are conducted at the hospital only for the patients who receive free lenses through the Health Ministry's Vision 2020 Programme.
According to hospital sources, doctors halted surgeries after the statement by Health Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne in connection with issuing lenses free of charge and taking legal action against doctors and the Hospital Director if surgeries are performed with lenses from the private sector.
