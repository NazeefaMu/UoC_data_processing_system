Turkish Airlines adds Phuket to its network

Turkish Airlines is now 300 destination strong. The global carrier has inaugurated its direct flights to Phuket, one of the most prominent tourist destinations in the world, as beginning from last week.
Flying to more countries and also international destinations than any other airline in the world, Turkish Airlines has started to operate four weekly flights to Phuket from July 17.
The inaugural flight from Istanbul landed at 8.55am in the Phuket International Airport (HKT) and was welcomed by the customary water cannon salutes in a formal ceremony.
Deputy Chairman and CEO of Turkish Airlines Mr. Bilal Eksi, commented at the launch ceremony: “Turkish Airlines is excited to be bringing more value and connectivity to its passengers through its ever expanding network. As an award-winning airline that invites people to explore the beauties of our world, it was a natural choice for us to decide on Phuket as our next destination.”
Introductory round trip fares are available from Istanbul to Phuket which is the biggest islands and exotic destination of Thailand. Direct flights from Istanbul to Phuket will be operated four times per week on Mondays, Thursdays, Saturdays and Sundays.
