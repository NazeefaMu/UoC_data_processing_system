Cop rejects to accept temporary revenue licence

A Police officer attached to the traffic branch of the Narahenpita Police station, refused to accept a temporary revenue licence obtained by a driver on line and issued a bill of penalty fine to him after keeping his driving licence under the police custody. The vehicle driver complained the incident to the emergency number of Police, 119 and to the Motor Traffic Department. The authorities said the temporary revenue licence which was obtained by him on line is valid.
