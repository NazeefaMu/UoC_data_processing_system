EDULINK’s partner University gains silver status

EDULINK International Campus, representing the University of Greenwich in Sri Lanka, recently celebrated an outstanding achievement by their partner University.
Greenwich emerged as a ‘silver’ university in the new Teaching Excellence Framework (TEF), which is a new system of assessment based on teaching. The TEF silver ranking is awarded to a university “that consistently facilitates, recognises and rewards excellent teaching and learning”.
The government's panel of assessors found that Greenwich students “achieve excellent outcomes” and enjoy “high levels of student satisfaction” with the teaching they receive on degree programs.
In order to achieve its silver status, Greenwich had to demonstrate core excellence in a number of areas. These included ‘personalised’ teaching, a strong commitment to learning from its students, and a high-quality learning environment, including investment in facilities and digital resources. The university also had to demonstrate that its students were gaining skills and knowledge highly valued by employers.
Devised by the Department for Education UK, the TEF rankings give students clear information about where excellent teaching is on offer, and enable them to take their pick from top rated universities to apply.Ultimately the TEF aims to ensure that all students ultimately receive an excellent teaching experience, one that encourages original thinking and prepares them for the world of work.
EDULINK whilst proud of the achievement of their partner University is also ready to utilise the value that their students can derive from this achievement through giving them access to a range of tools that will deliver world-class teaching, set high standards and equip their students with the knowledge, confidence and skills to succeed in their careers.
