Actor Sean Penn's meeting with Mexico kingpin led to capture

MEXICO : US actor Sean Penn interviewed Joaquin "El Chapo" Guzman three months before the Mexican drug lord's capture this week, Rolling Stone magazine revealed Saturday, a meeting that helped authorities track down the kingpin.
The US rock magazine published a picture showing Penn in a black shirt shaking hands with the mustachioed Sinaloa drug cartel leader, who is in a blue shirt, on October 2.
Penn writes that the 58-year-old Guzman gave him a big hug when they met at a Mexican jungle clearing and had a seven-hour sitdown followed by phone and video interviews. "I supply more heroin, methamphetamine, cocaine and marijuana than anybody else in the world," Guzman told Penn in a stunning admission of his criminal enterprise over sips of tequila.
"I have a fleet of submarines, airplanes, trucks and boats," Guzman said in the meeting, which Mexican actress Kate del Castillo helped to arrange.
A Mexican federal official told AFP that authorities "had knowledge of this meeting" and that it helped lead to Friday's recapture of the world's most wanted man in his northwestern home state of Sinaloa. Mexican Attorney General Arely Gomez said on Friday that Guzman had met with unnamed actors and producers in the hope of making a biopic about himself.
Rolling Stone also published a video showing Guzman without a mustache, talking about why he decided to go into drug trafficking after the age of 15 because there were "no job opportunities."
"Unfortunately, where I grew up, there was and there is no other way to survive," Guzman said.
Asked if he feels responsible for the high level of addictions in the world, he said: "It's false. The day that I don't exist, it won't reduce drug trafficking."
The Rolling Stone interview emerged after Mexican prosecutors announced that they would seek Guzman's extradition to the United States, a reversal from President Enrique Pena Nieto's refusal to send him across the border.
The Attorney General's office said it received two US extradition requests last year on a slew of charges, including drug trafficking and murder, and that it later obtained arrest warrants to ship him across the border.
"With Guzman Loera's recapture, the respective extradition proceedings will have to start," the office said in a statement.
It did not indicate when the hearings would start and noted that Guzman's lawyers could seek appeals.
One of Guzman's attorneys, Juan Pablo Badillo, vowed to take the case up to the Supreme Court if necessary.
"He shouldn't be extradited because Mexico has a fair Constitution," Badillo told reporters outside the Altiplano prison near Mexico City, where Guzman was sent following his arrest. - AFP
