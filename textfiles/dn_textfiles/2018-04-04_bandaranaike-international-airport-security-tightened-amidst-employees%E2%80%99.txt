Bandaranaike International Airport security tightened amidst employees’ protest

Security in and around the Bandaranaike International Airport (BIA) was tightened yesterday as several trade unions staged a protest demanding salary increase.
Trade unions representatives said the airport employees’ salaries were increased once in every three years since 1994. They said the airport employees have not received their due increment.
A spokesman of the SLFP trade union told the Daily News that all trade unions at the Airport will join a trade union action from today (3) if authorities do not give an ear to their demands. Transport and Civil Aviation Ministry sources when contacted by the Daily News said a Committee was appointed to look into the salary issues of the employees and the committee would meet the trade union representatives today (3)
