Colombo’s solid waste to be moved to Aruwakkalu

Cabinet approves proposal:
Cabinet approved the Ministry of Megapolis and Western Development’s plan to move solid waste in Colombo to a final disposal facility in Aruwakkalu, Puttlam, this week.
The project, known as the ‘Metro Colombo Solid Waste Management Project,’ has; working together with the Department of Wildlife, identified 85 acres near the Quarry site Railway station and the Operational Block of Siam City Cement (Lankan) Ltd in Aruwakkalu. This, the proposal stated, was more than 3km away from the Buffer Zone of the Wilpattu National Park.
The venture is estimated to cost Rs. 17.705 billion in total.
In addition, the Ministry has also chosen 25 acres of land belonging to the Sri Lanka Land Reclamation and Development Corporation (SLLRDC) to build a waste transfer station for the loading of municipal waste.
The South Korean company Dohwa Engineering, who was previously engaged in a feasibility study, has been asked to carry out a fresh consultancy for the project. The Ministry will also conduct a fresh EIA with the participation of all stakeholders concerned.
The project, initially planned for three years, has now been fast-tracked to 18 months given the current garbage crisis. Keeping in line with the motivate to clear up the garbage issue in the Capital, Minister of Megapolis and Western Development Champika Ranawaka also received Cabinet approval to spend to Rs. 1,848 million to rehabilitate Meethotamulla and Rs. 924 million to support the composting equipment on SLLRDC land in Kerawalapitiya.
