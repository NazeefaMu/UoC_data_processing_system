The Spinners Web

The number 1 Test Team in the World the Australians got entangled in our Spinners Web spearheaded by Rangana Herath and got trounced 3-0 in the recently concluded Test Series.
If this same Australian Team had to face the Indian spin quartet of Bishen Singh Bedi, Erapalli Prasanna, Bhagwat Chandrasekhar and Sriniwas Venkatraghavan the whole Australian team would have been “Signed Sealed and Delivered” to the pavilion in no time.
They were known as the “fab four’ in the sixties just like The Beatles in the sixties in England. In their own way they terrorized batsmen in much the same manner as Andy Roberts and Michael Holding, Jeff Thomson and Dennis Lillee.
Ian Chappell for one reckoned that the tour of India in 1969-70 was the last word in his cricketing education as he had to take on the spin bowlers at their peak on helpful tracks.
One of the best players of spin, Chappell said in an interview if the body had to show tremendous reflexes in trying to negotiate a fast bowler, the brain was working overtime in trying to tackle this four Indian spinners. They had so many ideas so many variations and all this with hardly any change in the action, that the batsman was at his wits’ end in just trying to see off an over successfully.
Erapalli Prasanna was a 21year Engineering student from Bangalore when he made his debut which was not impressive. He had to give priority to his studies and then get employment so that he could support his family since his father had died. As a result there was a gap in his Test carrer, however he kept on playing first class cricket.
Chandrasekhar also debut at the same time, he delivered the ball with sudden quick and jerky action, there was something puzzling about his bowling arm too. Then it came out that it had been withered by infantile paralysis when Chandra was young. The deformity in his arm gave him a flexibility that enabled him to deliver the ball with a quick and whippy action. He was not a leg spinner, most of them were either googlies or top spinners bowled at medium pace, and they reared up at the batsmen as if a cobra was striking a victim. The batsmen would not know till the last minute where the ball would pitch, how much it would bounce and turn. He bowled with his shirt sleeves buttoned down to heighten the mystery.
A super fast delivery from Chandra baffled and beat the outstretched bat of Vivian Richards in a Test in the West Indies in 1976.So stunned was Richards, (then in the midst of his greatest period ever, by the speed of the delivery), that once he had recovered his composure, he explained to Syed Kirmani behind the stumps:”Maan, that was as fast as Thommo(Jeff Thomson).”
In the 1966-67 Series the rise of Srinivas Venkatraghavan was almost as meteoric as Chandra and Prasanna. Although Prasanna had clever variations of flight, speed and spin, Venkat was the bigger spinner of the two, with his accuracy he could block one end up.
Bishen Singh Bedi was the fourth member of the spin quartet. He was a left arm orthodox bowler. He used to flight the ball and let it hang in the air so that the batsmen were baffled as to where it would pitch. His clever variations, subtlety, teasing curve and vicious turn and unpredictable bounce had the batsmen in all sorts of trouble.
Bedi was hailed as one of the best slow left arm bowlers, whose action never failed to have the connoisseurs drooling. He was also India’s most outspoken captains.
