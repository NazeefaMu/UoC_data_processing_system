A special memento commemorating the 40 year anniversary was presented by Sarath Ganegoda, Executive Director Hayleys to David Ooi, Vice President NEC Asia Pacific.
Fentons is the oldest distributor for NEC in South Asia and was one of only two companies from the Asian region who were invited to participate in NEC’s APAC 25th anniversary celebrations, owing to the unique long-standing relationship between the two companies.
Back in the late 1970’s, commencing with an agreement to act as distributors for NEC Key Telephone Systems, Fentons together with NEC introduced Sri Lanka’s very first PABX systems into the Sri Lankan market.
Comprising the communications backbone of most corporate offices, a PABX system is a telephone system within an enterprise that switches calls between internal users and the PSTN on local lines, while allowing all users to share intercommunication facilities within the office environment.
Today, Fentons is the only distributor company in South East Asia that exclusively deals with NEC PABX for their terminal products and systems and maintains a large network of customers island-wide.
The company is a pioneering systems integrator in the category of “Specialist Contractor” under the EM-1 categorization by the Construction Industry Development Authority (CIDA formerly known as ICTAD) Sri Lanka. The company has strong MEP engineering expertise executed through the efforts of a highly dedicated and well trained team to provide 24/7 service and support.
