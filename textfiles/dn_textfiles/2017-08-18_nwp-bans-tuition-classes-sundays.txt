NWP bans tuition classes on Sundays

The Ministry of Education of the NWP - PC has issued a circular banning the conducting of tuition classes on Sundays in and around the Kurunegala and Puttalam Districts of the NWP. Kumari Weerasekara, Secretary to the Provincial Ministry of Education – NWP, had signed and issued the circular instructing all school heads and Pirivena heads, school teachers and parents in the NWP not to permit school children to attend private classes on Sundays from 6.00 a.m to 1.30 p.m each day, as students have to study Dhamma at Sunday Dhamma schools. The students who study from Grade one to eleven ( up to G.C.E.(O.L) are thus prohibited from attending private tuition classes on Sundays.
NWP-PC Chief Minister and Education Minister of NWP Sandya Kumara Rajapakse had instructed the Secretary to the Provincial Education Ministry to issue this circular to induce students and parents to attend Dhamma schools on Sundays as religious education seems to have been neglected by the students over the undue competition among them towards public examinations, said Kurunegala District Divisional Secretary W. E. Jayathilake, today (17) in Kurunegala.
