JO ready to field spouses of government servants as candidates for upcoming LG polls: Vasu

The Joint Opposition will field spouses of government servants as candidates for the upcoming Local Government elections, as the government had deprived the rights of government servants to contest LG election, Parliamentarian Vasudeva Nanayakkara, said.
Addressing a press conference at the Dr. N. M. Perera Memorial Centre in Borella yesterday, he said spouses of Government officers would vie for LG Elections as the Government had deprived the rights of Government officers by prohibiting them from contesting LG Elections.
"We will take every possible effort to ensure that government servants are eligible to contest any upcoming election," he said.
Nanayakkara added that all political parties in Parliament except the Joint Opposition, agreed to deprive the rights of youths in the country by prohibiting government servants to contest LG elections. He said the government brought this amendment targetting the hundreds of dynamic youths who are expected to contest the upcoming Local Government election. "We call upon all those who would not be able to contest the upcoming Local Government elections because of this piece of law, should join us to ensure their right," he said.
