I am with Govt: Ven Rathana Thera

Jathika Hela Urumaya MP Ven. Athuraliye Rathana Thera, yesterday said the government’s ongoing constitutional reform process is the least of his worries.
“I am not worried about it because it will not objectify,” the Thera said.
He said so on being questioned by the Daily News if he meant to signal his opposition to the government that he is against its ongoing constitutional reform process as with his position taken recently to function as an independent MP.
The Thera replied: “I hold fast with the government. But I will function as an independent MP outside Parliament.”
“I am with the government, but no one in the government is responsible for what I do or say,” he said. Questioned as to why he took such a stance to go independent outside of Parliament, Ven. Rathana thera said, “I felt the need to form a broader national movement to influence the government as to how it should deliver economic growth.”
“We need intellectuals and experts to play their role in tracking the country’s economic development process, so that they would create their impact on the policies of the government for faster progress,” he pointed out.
