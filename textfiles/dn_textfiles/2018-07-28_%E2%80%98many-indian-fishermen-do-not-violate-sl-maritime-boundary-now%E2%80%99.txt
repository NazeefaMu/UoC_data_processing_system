Bilateral discussions flourish
‘Many Indian fishermen do not  violate SL maritime boundary now’

The number of Indian fishermen entering the northern territorial waters reduced by 75 per cent now as a result of the diplomatic discussions between the two countries, Fisheries and Aquatic Resources Development State Minister Dilip Wedaarachchi said.
Fisheries and Aquatic Resources Development Minister Vijith Vijithamuni Soysa and State Minister Wedaarachchi met the Northern fishermen and discussed the issues they face during a recent visit.
The fishermen urged the government to take measures to prevent the illegal entries. They said they observed a gradual reduction in the number. Indian fishermen are still violating the Sri Lankan maritime boundary and stealing its aquatic resources, they said. The two ministers told them that further discussions will be held with the Indian Government to find a permanent solution for the issue.
