‘Yahapalana Government has fulfilled people’s expectations’

People in Nawalapitiya made the UNP victorious at the last general elections with the fervent hope of ensuring development and progress in their electorate.
After laying the necessary groundwork during the last two years, the Yahapalana government has fulfilled their expectations by launching development work along with the food production drive and the results of this endeavour will be seen during the next three years, Kandy District UNP Parliamentarian Ananda Aluthgamage said.
He was addressing a meeting after laying the foundation stone for a proposed development project at Kurunduwatta, recently.
He said he laid foundation stones for five projects to be undertaken at a cost of Rs. 20 million provided by the Home Affairs Ministry on the initiative of Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe.
It would include the development of the Telihunne-Kadegedara and Raja Ela roads development of the Malwattagama Nila Piyasa and the Malwatte water supply project.
He said the roads he built earlier in his capacity as Pradesheeya Sabha Chairman from 1994 had gone to utter neglect causing inconvenience to people in the area. Since his crossover from the SLFP to the UNP, the party had won two elections held subsequently.
He said a project costing Rs 1.5 million would be launched to provide pipe-borne water supplies to Galpaya Grama Niladhari division.
He said steps would also be taken to provide pipe-borne water to all needy areas in Ganga Ihala division in the near future.
A UNP victory at the forthcoming Nawalapitiya Pradesheeya Sabha election would facilitate the speedy execution of these projects, he added.
