Wars, warriors and war crimes

It has been observed that never a day passes in the global context without hearing the terms linked to war. War is defined and understood in many ways from times immemorial. As social scientists and philosophers point out, the wars have begun as a result of tribal conflicts that existed in the most ancient societies. The origins of which are unfathomable.
Wars in the modern world are said to be planned and adopted as a measure of winning one sector over and above another. The entire ‘war culture’ has given way to quite a number of studies linked to the terms such as war strategies, war crimes, war zones, war stories, war victims and war heroes.
Whatever said and done, the concept of war is not taken as a virtuous measure for the well being of human existence.
Leo Tolstoy wrote a wonderful narrative named as ‘War and Peace’ (1862-69) where he visualises the picture of Russia set against a background of Napoleon’s invasion. The work is great as a result of placing the human context of peaceful living as against the cruelties caused by war. Tolstoy is sensitive and brings in a large number of victimizations caused by war.
He peeps into various issues connected sociologically, psychologically, politically and historically into the lives of people torn between the normal and the tragic situations. Tolstoy never approved of human victimization in bloodshed and cruelties caused by venomous warfare. The novel was written at a time when the term ‘war crimes’ was never heard of. But the average masses knew its meaning intimately.
Perhaps the term came to be used widely since the Second World War. The crimes caused as a result of warfare cannot be visualized as mere happenings. Attorney at Law and Chairman of the Sri Lanka Press Council, Koggala Wellala Bandula, points out in his latest book, Yuda Aparadha (War Crimes Godage 2015), wars cannot be won without creating crimes which are numerous and unpardonable.
In his resourceful and stimulating study he states that quite a number of disasters take place as war crimes. Initially as he points out the innocent civilians are faced with death and dispossession. Then the children and women are victimized and die regardless of their birthright as humans. They are innocent and normal human beings who are also physically and mentally deranged and victimized.
An industry springs up with the manufacture of war weapons. They bring unforeseen disasters. As he says initially, it is just one rifle shot or gun power that brings about this disaster. The soldiers are trained and their minds are made to suit the use of weapons for destruction of the enemy front.
Koggala Wellala Bandula in his eye-opening contribution points out those war crimes could be classified into various groups. Accordingly he shows how this has been formulated by various peace seeking human agencies down the years. The bringing about harm to the living creatures and the living environments is basically a matter to be taken seriously. In the name of war humans are seen reduced to the utmost evil state of living. Most crimes without much awareness could be caused in the name of war.
It is possible to create a crime undermining the ethics of the civil society which yearns for a peaceful existence. But with the declaration of a war it is nevertheless disturbed. It too hampers the medical services, religious movements, educational climates, food production and lawful living conditions and brings about calamities to human properties both personal and public.
It is also visualized as Bandula in his research shows that the plunder of wealth too takes place hand in glove with the killing of humans. War continues in various types of racial and ethnic mini battles. With copious examples, the author shows how this happens. He selects a global standpoint in his drawing of examples and gradually pinpoints some of the local situations.
Bandula shows that with war, the human understandings are reduced to the basic levels of degeneration causing the most number of disasters eroding the humane aspects. He shows as one solid example of how the schools were bombarded in Vietnam on the part of the enemy forces allowing children and teachers to die in pain.
On reading this work I detected that this document running to 152 pages is just not an essay on the war crimes. It is a sensitive research project where the reader will share the war crimes drawn from various countries such as Israel, Gautamala, South Africa, Vietnam El Salvador, Ireland, Lebanon Cambodia and needless to say Sri Lanka. All these are drawn from genuine sources culled and inserted with care impartially and painstakingly. With facts and figures thus obtained from sources, he also tries to underline the types of weapons and other chemicals utilised in warfare in the name of technological advancement.
As a measure to win a battle he sees that the tragedy of employing children in warfare as child soldiers where the humane quality of living had reduced to the cruelest level detestable. He also sees the tragedy of making use of human body parts in the field of medicine and medical research as a war crime. The experiments laid on the victims become a war crime as a result of the inhuman non sensitivity of the victors. Another war crime is the allowance of people to be in hunger as a result of the plunder of food material. Many more are laid down for the scrutiny of those interested in not only war crimes but also in humanism.
All these impediments and violations on the quality of living and the basic right to exist on the earth planet as a result of war are regarded as war crimes. Great treaties and conferences have been held over the years to eradicate and bring about a total stop to war crimes. But has it been implemented properly?
The writer cum researcher Wellala Bandula uses a simple readable style of writing in the pronouncement of his thesis which makes the reader feel that creative communicators who utilize mass media channels such as print sound and visual have a vital role to play in depicting the terrible horrendous situations that are created via war crimes. The writer researcher opens our eyes on the Geneva protocol as well as other human rights movements of the United Nations pinpointing the needs of the day as aftermath of two world wars and numerous other communal racial and ethnic wars around the globe.
