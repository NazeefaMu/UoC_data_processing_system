Bocuse d’Or Sri Lanka contest for world live culinary competition

In January 1987, Paul Bocuse, an icon in the culinary world, created the Bocuse d’Or, a revolutionary gastronomy contest, giving young chefs a unique opportunity to demonstrate their skills, offering them a tremendous springboard for their careers.
From one competition to the next, its international influence has grown constantly.
The competition brings together 24 young chefs from all over the world, among the most promising talents of their generation, and sees them prepare amazing dishes within an allotted time period, live in front of an enthusiastic audience.
The jury comprises some of the world's best chefs. Beyond a mere cooking contest, Bocuse d'Or is a show that draws extraordinary media coverage.
Many talented chefs have made a name for themselves thanks to the contest. Along with the successive creation of contests in Latin America, Asia and Europe, Bocuse d’Or has become a showcase revealing outstanding talents and gastronomic trends from all over the world. Beyond the competition itself, the Bocuse d’Or has created its own family: a global network of chefs, future celebrities and famous cooks, and partner companies.
They all share the same values of creativity, rigour and innovation, are committed to passing on their skills and have a passion for fine food. The competition to select the Asian finalists will take place in the Asia Pacific Region where 12 countries will participate and the top five countries will be invited to the global final in Lyon, France, in January 2018.
This is the fourth time in the history of the event that Sri Lanka has been invited to participate. Spearheading the Bocuse d’ Or Sri Lankan chapter is culinary guru Rohan Fernandopulle together with an executive committee comprising some of the most renowned chefs in Sri Lanka
Commitee members, chefs from 23 hotels and guest speakers
Team Sri Lanka was short of a few marks, to be selected to participate in Lyon 2017. At the competition held in 2013, Team Sri Lanka was selected to participate at the World Finals in Lyon, France, after being placed among the top four at the Asia Pacific competition. This year’s competition will be conducted by Bocuse d’ Or Sri Lanka together with Sri Lanka Tourism and CHSGA.
In order to provide our chefs with appropriate training triple Bocuse d’ Or Winner Chef Eng Tong was flown in from Singapore for the pre-training programme held in May at the SLITHM premises. Along with him, a Bocuse d’ Or approved international and local jury will be selected to ensure the high standards of the competition.
"Currently the hospitality industry is facing a vacuum of experienced talent with international exposure and competitions create the perfect platform for our young chefs to garner exposure of this nature," said Rohan Fernandopulle. "With the high culinary standards it is important for Sri Lankans to benchmark the best of the best and step up to extraordinary culinary standards.
Our local chefs have an innate ability create spectacular dishes and I believe with the correct training and guidance we have been able to provide them, Sri Lanka will soon be rubbing shoulders with the culinary giants of the world. Fernandopulle followed."
“Rallying behind us we have some great sponsors and partners who believe in our vision of culinary excellence and this wouldn’t have been possible without them,” Fernandopulle said. The main sponsor is Dilmah and the partners are CHGSA and SLITHM and Sri Lanka Tourism. Other sponsors are USMEF, Edinborough, Round Island, Pragmatic, Euro-Kitchen, Eoas, Nestle, Fonterra, CDC Events, Unilever Food Solutions, East West, SriLankan Airlines, Connaissance, Queens Workwear, Galle Face Hotel, Movenpick Hotel, Waters Edge, Captcha Eye, MAS, TNl, Litro and Beko.
The national selection for Bocuse d’ Or Sri Lanka will be held on June 30 at the BMICH premises followed by a gala dinner and awards ceremony at Waters Edge where Team Sri Lanka will be awarded the opportunity to represent Sri Lanka in Bocuse d’ Or Asia 2018.
