31 affiliated members decide today:
Election for Sri Lanka’s highest post in sport

The much debated National Olympic Committee (NOCSL) election will be held today at the NOCSL headquarters, commencing 6pm to appoint office bearers who will govern the apex sports body for a four-year term. The two main parties headed by presidential candidates Rohan Anthony Fernando and Suresh Subramaniam seek a majority vote to appoint 12 top officials in the NOCSL. It has been a controversial election campaign from the beginning with both parties pointing fingers at each other.
The three-member NOCSL Election Committee headed by Dr. R.M.K. Ratnayaka yesterday put an end to a lot of confusion and controversy involved with the election by deciding that only 31 affiliated members will be eligible to vote at the election. The election committee was appointed by the immediate past president Hemasiri Fernando and included S. Virithamulla and S. Liyanagama as the other members.
The number of eligible votes has been a controversy from the beginning as presidential candidate Rohan's alliance lodged protests against voting eligibility of some federations. They pointed out that Hockey and Badminton federations have been dissolved and functioning under the Director General of Sports, so they should not be allowed to vote. The main controversy was about the eligibility of two votes by the Athletes' Commission. The Athletes’ Commission was established in 2016 on an International Olympic Committee (IOC) recommendation. Even though the NOCSL constitution allows two votes by the Athletes' Commission, Rohan's alliance protested that the Athletes' Commission has not yet obtained approval from the General Assembly of IOC and ratification from the IOC, which is the legitimate procedure for voting rights.
Considering the protests, the NOCSL Election Committee yesterday cleared the doubts, by allowing the two votes by the Hockey and Badminton federations while not approving the Athletes' Commission's votes. The NOCSL Election Committee further said that only after the IOC ratification and its general Assembly approval, the Athletes' Commission will be allowed to vote at future elections.
As both parties had no objections on the Election Committee's verdict, the IOC representative who will be arriving today will most likely play the role of an IOC supervisor at the election.
Presidential candidate Suresh Subramaniam said that he is very confident of winning the race from the beginning. “I have over 25 years of experience in local and international sports administration. I have a good plan to develop sports and I know how to do that properly. I have never tried to influence anyone and never did anything below the belt," he said.
Former NOCSL secretary and secretary candidate from Suresh's alliance Maxwell de Silva emphasized preserving the spirit of sports and serving Sri Lankan sport are his top priorities regardless of winning or losing at the election.
"We never wanted to create problems and not a single objection or protest has been lodged by us. So we hope that we will get the majority," he said. Senaka Clement Ranasinghe is the candidate for the treasurer’s post from Suresh's side.
The other presidential candidate Rohan Anthony Fernando claims that he will get a clear majority if the member federations want to rescue NOCSL from corruption. "People who are against corruption will vote for my alliance. We are very confident that even under a lot of influence by the other party, the rightful people will support us to take Sri Lankan sports to the next level," he commented.
The secretary candidate from Rohan's side, Rohan Prithiviraj Perera said that he wishes the Election Committee will act neutrally, despite influence attempts by the strong rivals.
"We were subjected to lot of ill treatment and one of our Ex-Co candidates had to withdraw at the last moment due to a trap set by the other party. So we have only 11 candidates in our list. But we hope the sports loving people will give us the mandate today," he said. Shirantha Peries is the treasurer candidate from Rohan's side.
