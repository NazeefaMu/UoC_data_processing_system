PAFFREL says action will be taken against minister

Action will be taken if the Minister in charge was continuously rejecting the Delimitation Committee report, the People’s Action For Free and Fair Elections (PAFFREL) Organization said.
The Organization said that a request would be made to the Chairman of the Elections Commission to hold elections even though the minister would be delaying the election process by providing justifications.
Chairman of the Elections Commission will be informed to plan the necessary activities with the consultation of the Attorney General and Executive Director of PAFFREL Organization, Rohana Hettiarachchi said.
