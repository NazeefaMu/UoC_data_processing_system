Prof. Chandana Jayaratne to probe Polonnaruwa UFO story

Astronomer and Head of the Colombo University Physical Science Department Prof. Chandana Jayaratne has decided to conduct investigations regarding the unidentified flying object observed in the sky over the Polonnaruwa Sacred City recently.
The object which appeared from the direction of the Dimbulagala Mountain around 9 and 10 pm passed through the sky like a star emitting green, blue and orange rays, with the reflection caused by the moonlight. Such UFOs were observed in the Polonnaruwa sky during the months of August, September and October last year too.
