Of pain and pleasure

Originality, uniqueness and confidence are the pillars on which Umaria Sinhawansa Perera has built her career on. She is a woman who does not allow anyone to hold her back. TnC Melodies features Umaria, a performer whose winning attitude along with talent has enabled her to conquer the music scene in Sri Lanka.
Umaria’s genres include R&B, jazz, pop, Funk. It is basically a cocktail of everything combined together. She has managed to combine these genres into her Sinhalese music as well, especially when performing live. No doubt her talent has played a big part in her musical development. To be able to combine genres into Sinhala really does take some flair.
Interestingly enough Umaria’s inspiration comes from real life. In other words what she sings about is what you are I are going through. Our pain and pleasure. If it makes sense to Umaria then it becomes part of a song that connects with us on a very deep level. It is also important to Umaria, that the producer is on the same page as her. Along with the melody comes the lyrics. Lyrics that form this bond with us and Umaria.

“We live in a world where many issues need to be pointed out. And music is the best way to convey these concerns. I'm particularly an advocate for women and children's rights. So as long as my songs make an impact on certain issues, that is the end goal. And fortunately people have embraced every project and I couldn't be happier,” explained Umaria.
Umaria says she has always been a goal oriented person. One would suppose that setting goals is Umaria’s way of attaining her ambitions. For someone like Umaria, ambition is a natural consequence of her talent and her personality. She is very determined and focused. She is someone who sets targets and someone who dreams. Achieving those dreams, goals and ambitions is only a matter of time because of her potential.
“I've always been a very goal oriented person. I set goals for myself that are challenging. And I somehow manage to achieve them before the deadline. For the future I have plans and ambitions that are more challenging but somehow I will achieve them. And only time will tell,” says Umaria.
At the age of 14, Umaria started her music career. Regents and leaders in history have often started their careers at a young age. To enter the highly competitive music industry at the age of 14 takes courage. It takes courage and talent. Umaria is content with her career. She has worked hard and now she is enjoying her success. It has really paid off. She has achieved the stuff of dreams, singing with the late great maestro Amaradeva, and creating a song that will live forever. But it does not slow down. Umaria will continue to work incredibly hard because there are so many worlds to conquer.
Umaria is who she is today because of the artistes that have inspired her. But indeed Sri Lanka is too small for Umaria.
She needs a bigger kingdom. To date she has released around 40 - 50 singles. They are in the form of movie songs, Tele-drama and collaborations. Her English material will be out in a short while. Umaria grew up with music. Her parents are also musicians and no doubt their influence has played an important role in her success. Possibly they saw the potential for success in Umaria. They have become an inspiration and role model to her. The young Umaria also blossomed because of her husband and also because of two other musical giants – Bathiya and Santhush.
The Industry has evolved. There are the positive and negatives. We can do amazing things if we respect each other. If talent and decency are put together then society benefits. Music can do amazing things. But along with a great voice you need a great heart. Your voice will fade. You music will fade. You need to put a soul into your music. Then it will live forever.
“My advice to anyone who wants to become a musician is to work hard, cultivate a proper work ethic. Have discipline and always have goals, without a goal it's like a ship without navigation. Know what you want and just go for it. And ALWAYS have a positive and humble mind set,” said Umariya.
