Crescent Global to support  insurance awards

When the crème de la crème of the local insurance industry come together to meet students who have won awards and obtained exam certificates from the Sri Lanka Insurance Institute, it creates a day to remember.
This signature event was held at the Bishop’s College auditorium earlier this month, and was exclusively sponsored by Crescent Global South Asia, part of Crescent Global Group, a Lloyd’s accredited insurance broker.
Understanding the need for more qualified and recognized personnel in the insurance industry, the Crescent Global Director, Indrajith Fernando said, his organization takes a personal interest in the graduates of the Sri Lanka Insurance Institute.
It is the only institution that produces the quality of individuals that the insurance industry in Sri Lanka so desperately needs, he says.
Dr. Jagath Alwis, Chief Guest said that this approach “requires a particular precision training, and Insurance industry captains have come to respect the Sri Lanka Insurance Institute, as it produces candidates who have the right attitudes, and of course the right level of industry based knowledge to drive the industry. We are committed to developing the Insurance Institute and to support in any way to further this cause.”
Crescent Global South Asia operates in many countries across the region and understands the issues of both the local and global Insurance industry like no other. At this moment where the Sri Lanka Insurance Institute, the industry educational body is awarding their successful students, Cresent Global is delighted to partner the worthy cause said director Fernando
The Insurance business is expanding to such an extent that Fernando sees that there should be a new approach to training new recruits for the insurance business.
He hopes that Crescent Global South Asia’s alliance with the Sri Lanka Insurance Institute will help the industry evolve and provide the highly skilled and knowledgeable individuals that the industry needs. We are discussing and hoping to advance education further with Crescent by using the Web-educate portal, which is owned by the Crescent
He believes that the Institute works with the signal desire to produce the future leaders of the insurance industry. The Institute also facilitates the special kind of learning that peers appreciate and the Insurance industry elites desire, which is why when a cohort of Insurance industry practitioners graduate from the institute, the mentors of the industry have great expectations for their future and as such they feel it is so important for them to be present at this event, for which Crescent Global is the sole principal sponsor. “This is a prestigious unique event of the Sri Lanka Insurance Institute (SLII), and we wish to thank Crescent Global South Asia for their commitment to support.
SLII is the pioneer educational body in Insurance education and we look forward to the support of all stakeholders to enhance the necessary talent for the industry,” Thusitha Nandasiri President SLII said.
