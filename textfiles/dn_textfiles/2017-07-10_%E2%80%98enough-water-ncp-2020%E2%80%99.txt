‘Enough water for NCP by 2020’

The North Central Province would be armed to face any drought by 2020. The Moragahakanda reservoir, the Yanoya reservoir under constructions, the proposed lower Malwathu Oya reservoir and the NCP canal will be able to provide adequate irrigating and drinking water facilities to the people in the province, especially for those in the Anuradhapura district, NCP Chief Minister Peshala Jayarathna Bandara said.
He was engaging in an official tour in the Polonnaruwa Elahera Division to distribute maize seeds among farmers. Rs.15 million worth of seeds were distributed among 1,500 farmer families during the visit.
The Chief Minister said the farmers could cultivate maize and Soya since those required less water and offer a high income.
He said a 1/4 acre of ginger plants cultivated scientifically by several farmers in Walikanda have earned Rs.1.2 million for them last year.
