Piling and diaphragm wall construction for Havelock City awarded to Access Engineering

Access Engineering PLC, one of Sri Lanka’s leading engineering companies renowned for high standard of workmanship in the area of piling and diaphragm wall construction and soil retention works, was recently awarded with the contract for the installation of bored, cast in-situ reinforced concrete piles and a diaphragm wall for Havelock City, the premier integrated mixed-use development coming up in Colombo.
Havelock City, the brainchild of S.P. Tao, is developed by Mireka Capital Land, a fully owned subsidiary of Overseas Realty (Ceylon) PLC, the owner, developer and manager of the iconic World Trade Centre, Colombo.
The Havelock City Commercial Development is a 50-storeyed complex which houses a 600,000 sqft Grade ‘A’ premium office tower designed to be a LEED GOLD certified building and a 200,000 sqft shopping mall.
The office space will comprise smart functioning infrastructure with computerized car park, elevator, building management systems while the shopping mall comprises six floors of international branded retail stores, dining and entertainment facilities amidst a state-of-the-art multiplex cinema.
The work awarded to Access Engineering PLC includes the erection of a diaphragm wall, which is 557m long and 18m to 22m deep from the ground level and the installation of 436 No. bored piles.
As the project is scheduled to be completed within seven months, considerable effort is assigned by the engineering team to ensure the project is completed on time while meeting the strict noise and vibration limits, work time restrictions and the sensitivity of the earth.
“At Access Engineering, we constantly look at ways of improving on what has been achieved before, such as in this project, we erect a diaphragm wall - a technique which was introduced to Sri Lanka for the first time by Access Engineering PLC,” said Saman Kumara, project manager of the installation of bored, in-situ reinforced concrete piles and a diaphragm wall project.
