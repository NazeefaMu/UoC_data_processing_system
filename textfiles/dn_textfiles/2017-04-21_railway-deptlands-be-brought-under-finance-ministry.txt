Railway Dept.lands to be brought under Finance Ministry

The government has decided to bring land belonging to the Department of Railways under a separate institution coming under the Finance Ministry.
The President said, the robbed railway land would be redeemed and brought under a separate institution in the Finance Ministry.
He also said that he will soon conduct a government audit.
“No President has done this before. Even this government has failed to do it for the past two years. I have now decided to sit with the officials from the Auditor General’s Department for this purpose. It will start in May.
One of the former Auditor Generals has pointed out that it was the responsibility of the President to conduct a national government audit”, said President Sirisena.
