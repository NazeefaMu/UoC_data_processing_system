Harmony of religions

I did not think that my recent ‘pola day’ encounter with Kenyan-born nun Sister Estelle would be a sort of precursor to culminate in an awareness never to have been experienced before. It was out of the blues that she emerged from that motley crowd having sighted me from a distance and even before the usual Sri Lankan pleasantries could be exchanged asked, “what are you doing tomorrow evening?” I said,”Sister, what the next minute has in store, one never knows.”
“Well if you find time why don’t you come to church for our Christmas party? “she said.
For one to whom all religious places of worship and chantings disturb my inner peace for my belief in God being a non-traditional acceptance of doing the right thing with no conflict of interest, this caring invitation led me to a kind of reluctance and trepidation that I dare not disclose to her with the ultimate thought that there could be some message in this whole exercise as Sister Estelle herself proclaimed the following day, “nothing happens by accident.”
My ignorance of procedural formalities at such functions compelled me to inquire friends of the Christian fraternity about the do’s and don’ts that entail such a function and was informed that not being a part of the congregation licensed me to the non- adherence of whatever religious protocol the gathering warrants. I stand to disagree with their belief as my not being a part of the congregation - for had they specifically mentioned visible congregation I would not have minded for who or what is to decide on my congregational membership?
And so, come 4 o’clock the following day on January 1st, I was there at the church only to be welcomed by Mother Theresa whose life-size picture celebrated the sprawling church entrance. As I walked down the silent corridor, I was soon to be in the company of the affable resident Priest Father Antony Christy whose first question to me was whether I was a Roman Catholic. Unbound by the fetters of formal religion, my soul wriggled in trying to reach out for an answer. Addressing him I said, “Father, when the Buddha sat under the Bo tree and reached enlightenment he did not call it Buddhism for the Nirvanic state cannot be labelled. The whole exercise of labelling is worldly and relative. Nirvana being an unrelated state of absolute bliss and peace has nothing to do with whatever is relative. Likewise, when Jesus reached Mt. Olives and fell down in a spiritual swoon, he did not label it as Christianity. So did Prophet Muhammed when in the cave atop Mt. Hira he was confronted with the highest spiritual bliss he would not label it as Islam. The purity of perfection or truth cannot be labelled. The segregation of congregational divisions was not their creation and aim but arose from social constructs to keep the system alive.”
With raised eyebrows and dropped jaws Father Christy listened to me very attentively and we parted our ways on entering a beautiful summer house where the party per se was to take place. A band played and the hands behind each instrument were all ‘special youth”. The timing was perfect. The beat very vigorous. The vocals resonant. Followed by all this was the elders’ drama highlighting a moral ending of poetic justice. Then came the girls that lined up for a dance item. After their traditional greeting before the audience, they put on a splendid performance - the youngest - a 4-year-old stole everyone’s heart as she daintily stepped to rhythm and song. Their shortfall was a few donations of musical instruments to come their way not to forget a piano, even a used one some kind soul is willing to part with, which for these children will illumine their lives. They are all residents of the home run by the sisters of Mother Theresa’s church at Wellawa in Kurunegala. Going by their performance, it was indicative of the reservoir of talent these inmates are gifted with and such donations would surely facilitate their recovery as well.
This dedicated team of nuns is from Nigeria, Kenya, India, the Philipines and Bangladesh - the youngest at 22 sister Sabina, the only Sri Lankan over here. Caring for 60 elders and 15 ‘special youth ‘ with absolutely no foreign funding is ‘no piano ‘ yet their ‘heart is in the matter ‘ as they face Jim Reeves’ hymn dedicated to Christ, ‘one day at a time.’ To the numerous other religious establishments and ironically some within the Christian denomination itself that prioritize money over all else, these nuns indeed are emulation worthy as they live up to Mother Theresa’s cherished ideals needless to mention those of Jesus Christ himself.
Besides, it was the grandest Christmas party ever for this writer - the grandeur of which came off in its high degree simplicity. Devoid of the vanity, pomposity, cock of the walk arrogance, conceit and sophistication that hallmark Colombo’s elite gatherings come Christmas or otherwise, the simplicity of this small and humble gathering was a memory enhancer ever to remain there even in the years to follow. Artificiality was not within their realms. Recalling from scripts were not their bane. Everything was so very spontaneous and natural as the inmates took the evening by storm till the sun went down casting its last rays on the tiny but well kept lawn that bordered the beautiful summer house.
