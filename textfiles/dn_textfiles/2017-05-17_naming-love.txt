On naming love

The term ‘reading’, I feel, has much more to it than it really implies when one says that he or she had read a book. Visuals such as films could also be read if the mere superficial meaning is altered or shifted. When I watched the Sinhala film ‘Premaya Nam’ (Naming Love), I felt as if I am reading a page-moving psychological narrative with quite a lot of meaningful layers.
On surface level, it is a film of suspense mood. The narrative is woven about Vishva (Shyam Fernando) a married man who suffers from a mental disorder. It is something the common spectator is not aware about.
Vishva’s doctor familiarises the spectator with the sickness as OCD or Obsessive Compulsive Disorder. It may not sound as a serious sickness. But in the light of the happenings, frame by frame, the spectator gets the feeling that it brings in painful and embarrassing moments in day to day activities.
Chaotic disorder
The person who suffers most in the narrative is shown as Samadhi, wife of Vishva. She looks desperate as a marital partner. The spectator, or the reader of the visual narrative, gets to witness how everything goes well on surface layer. There are, however, occasional moments of disarray leading to a complex chaotic disorder in the relationship between the young couple.
Their problem comes to be discussed at a very serious level by parents of both parties. They too look desperate and agonised. The medical treatment continues to the point that there is not a single moment of dullness in any visual frame. Serious psychological matters are intimately discussed. They are presented sensitively and quite touchingly. No unwanted scene is inserted to make the spectator to feel the pulse of the pseudo pop cultural traits. Instead, the characters become mentors who matter in their lives, paving the way to one’s own classical examination of behaviour pattern.
The spectator does not get the feeling that he is being advocated on medical science. On seeing the series of visuals shot in the mental hospital with a group of other patients, I went down my memory lane reminiscent of films such as ‘Viridiana’ and ‘One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest’. But I am pretty certain that not an iota of a scene is cribbed by way of piracy. Kalpana and Vindana ought to be commended on their elevated level of creative imagination that surpasses the mere barriers of persuasive vulgarity. The hallmark of the film from a synoptic view is the sense of hum, a sympathy at the introspection that embraces.
The moments of bliss suddenly fade into moments of pain and pity, creating an inner layer of silence within the mind of the spectator. This too is blended in a tinge of religiosity that needs to be perceived in silence. Music has been used to enhance this feeling.
Private experience
The mental disorder of the protagonist of the narrative, Vishwa, drives himself and his fellow mates into a sense of strange unhappiness. This is depicted in a series of visuals: the inner agony not only of an individual, but a whole group of human beings. The vision that emanates is of human interest, and transcends a mere private experience.
The lack of human understanding could drive humans themselves into a so called crazy world where an imbalance could bring about the creation of an outsider.
This was actually the central theme of Albert Camus’ novel ‘Outsider’. The English writer Colin Wilson too tried to interpret who an outsider is in his popular research in the early sixties. All in all, the Sinhala film ‘Premaya Nam’ could be assigned as one of the trendsetting imaginative visual creations to emerge.
The narrative rises to a recovery of the imbalance. It was flashed that the story was based on a true story. True enough, truth is stranger than fiction and the truth is blissful. May it be stated with honesty that this is the type of screenplay that should be available in the printed form, enabling the young cinematographers to graph the essence of creativity and social conscience.
