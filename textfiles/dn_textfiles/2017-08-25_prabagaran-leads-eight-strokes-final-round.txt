K. Prabagaran fired an Eagle on the 18th to finish the 3rd Round 2 under, for an eight under par total going in to the final round of the ongoing Sri Lanka Open Golf Championship at the Nuwara Eliya Golf Club yesterday. Mithun Perera hung-in there with a dogged 2 under par to take 2nd place on Even Par for the Open Championship eight shots behind the leader.
Anura Rohana is in 3rd place, a further stroke behind. However, the sensation for the day was B G Lalith Kumara who had a scintillating run of six Birdies on the 2nd, 4th, 5th, 7th, 10th, 11th and an Eagle on the 8th to be 8 under par playing the 12th hole, at which stage Lalith Kumara was in 2nd place, 4 strokes behind leader Prabagaran. Nonetheless, Lalith Kumara blundered in Switzerland and dropped seven strokes 2 double Bogeys and 3 Bogeys on 12th, 13th, 14th, 15th, 17th respectively to be just 1 under playing the 18th and birdied the last hole to finish on 2 under par, overall 4th place, 11 strokes behind the leader. Nuwara Eliya home hero was set to win comfortably having won the Sri Lanka Open twice before at the RCGC in 2014 and 2015.
