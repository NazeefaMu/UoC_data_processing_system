Vidanagamage, and old boy of St. Thomas' College Guruthalawa and an avid sportsman said he intends on working towards the good of the people of Moneragala.
"I was a former Provincial Minister and was deprived of my position due to a political tug-o-war. I have dedicated my life to the people and I thank President Maithripala Sirisena for giving me the oppurtunity to serve the people of Moneragala again" he said.
Vidanagamage who assumed duties in Badulla last morning was taken in procession to Moneragala where he addressed a large gathering attended by local political leaders.
"We must work together to develop Moneragala.That is my primary aim.We have to bring the glory back to our village and city, and for that we must let go of all our differences. Be it UNP, SLFP, JVP or any other party, we must shed all of those differences and come together as one people to serve this great city and village" he said.
Vidanagamage is the eldest son of veteran Sri Lanka Freedom Party stalwart Gunapala Vidanagamage.
