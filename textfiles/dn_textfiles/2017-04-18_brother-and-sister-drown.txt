Brother and sister drown

Two persons belonging to the same family drowned while they were bathing in the Sindrathriya estuary in Wennappuwa on April 16 evening.
They were identified as Nishani Fernando, 17, of Sindrathriya, Wennappuwa and her younger brother Randima Fernando. Wennappuwa Police said even though neighbours rushed to save them, they died by the time they were pulled out of the water.
The two bodies are lying at the Marawila hospital morgue. The inquests were due to be held yesterday.
