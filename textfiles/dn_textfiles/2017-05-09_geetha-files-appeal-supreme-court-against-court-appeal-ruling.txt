Geetha files appeal before Supreme Court against Court of Appeal ruling

 
Geetha Kumarasinghe has filed an appeal before the Supreme Court today against the Court of Appeal ruling disqualifying her as MP.
Earlier today, Parliament General Secretary Dhammika Dassanayake informed the Election Commissioner Mahinda Deshapriya that UPFA Galle District Parliamentarian Geetha Kumarasinghe’s post as MP is officially terminated.
On May 3, the Appeal Court ruled that MP Geetha Kumarasinghe could no longer function as a MP as she had contested the election while bearing dual citizenship.
Kumarasinghe holds dual citizenship in Sri Lanka and Switzerland.
