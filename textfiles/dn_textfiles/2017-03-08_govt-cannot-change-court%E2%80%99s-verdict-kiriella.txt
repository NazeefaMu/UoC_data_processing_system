Govt cannot change court’s verdict: Kiriella

During the previous regime, protest marches were held to accept the verdict of the Court, but today, protest marches are being held to reject the the Court's verdict. The Court has given a verdict to accept SAITM, and the government cannot change a Court’s verdict, Higher Education and Highways Minister Lakshman Kiriella said.
SAITM was not commenced by our government, but by the previous government. It is during our government’s term that the first batch of students graduated, he said. Former President Mahinda Rajapaksa granted Rs.600 million to commence SAITM, but no one spoke against SAITM back in the day because they were afraid of being taken away in white vans.
The minister stated these views during an observation tour at a branch of the Institute of Technology, University of Moratuwa, (ITUM) in Diyagama, Homagama, to inspect the final phase of the construction of a new building complex on March 6. Under the direction of the Ministry of Higher Education and Highways, the building complex is being constructed at a cost of Rs. 10.2 billion and is inclusive of a student and teacher hostel, fully facilitated auditoriums, laboratories, and a 1,400-seat lecture hall. Constructed in accordance to international standards, the building complex is expected to be completed within this year.
He said, "It was the United National Party (UNP) that first introduced free education to the country. Therefore, we will preserve the free education system. It was also the UNP who first began distributing free textbooks and uniform materials to students."
"Our government has planned to commence two new medical universities in the Wayamba and Ratnapura areas. These will be state universities, not private ones," he said.
The minister said, "I request the university students to end their class strike and re-engage in their studies. Many external forces are manipulating university students to accomplish their political needs. A house used for ragging by students of the University of Peradeniya was found a few weeks ago. It is people like this who maintain such torture chambers that participate in protest marches against the government."
"Our government is ready to listen to the people of this country, but not people who engage in such vile acts. No beneficial developments towards the medical profession will outcome by these protests being held. All these protests and rallies are being held with a political motive. So, don’t fall prey to these sly schemes. People maintaining torture chambers cannot make decisions regarding the country’s educational and health policies," the minister said.
