Court recalls warrants against Wimal, Jayantha

The Colombo Chief Magistrate yesterday ordered to recall warrants issued against National Freedom Front (NFF) leader Wimal Weerawansa and MP Jayantha Samaraweera for not appearing in Court in connection with a case filed against them by the Cinnamon Garden Police.
However, they surrendered in Court through lawyers and made a request to recall the warrant issued against them. The Defence Counsel informed Court that their clients were unable to be present in Court due to the extreme traffic congestion in the Colombo city. They were advised to be present in Court in due course.
Last Monday, the two suspects were not present before Chief Magistrate Lal Ranasinghe Bandara over an allegation that the NFF leader and five others provided leadership to a protest which blocked the main roads at Bauddhaloka Mawatha, causing a disturbance to the people and the normal flow of traffic. Further magisterial inquiry is fixed for June 12. On February 6, 2016, the NFF staged a protest march against the visit of United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights Zeid Ra'ad Al Hussein.
Six suspects including the NFF leader and Colombo District MP Wimal Weerawansa, Jayantha Samaraweera, Weerakumara Dissanayake, Piyasiri Wijenayake, Roger Seneviratne, Mohammed Muzammil and Don Lusian are currently out on bail.
