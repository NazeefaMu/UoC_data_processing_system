A record number of pancakes

A flour company in Russia broke a world record by preparing nearly 13,000 pancakes to celebrate the week before Lent.
Russian flour exporter JSC MAKFA honored three, which celebrates the beginning of Spring, by preparing 12,716 pancakes to claim the Guinness World Record for ‘Largest serving of pancakes’.
A total of 16 professional chefs gathered to cook the pancakes in a tent outside a public art gallery in Moscow.
The chefs cooked for nearly eight hours to produce the record-breaking heap of pancakes, which were then dished up for the public.
MAKFA Director Natalia Yurevich expressed her gratitude to the chefs and everyone else involved after Guinness World Records adjudicators Lucia Sinigagliesi and Glenn Pollard certified the official tally.
“Thank you, we are very happy to have this record,” Yurevich said. UPI
