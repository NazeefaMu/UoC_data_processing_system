Make room for Meghan Markle

Meghan Markle is about to join more than one select group. Through her May 19 wedding to Prince Harry, she will not only become a member of the British royal family—she will also make history as one of just a handful of Americans to become a senior royal around the globe.
Her predecessors include Wallis Simpson, who became the Duchess of Windsor when she married the recently-abdicated King Edward VIII; Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis' younger sister Caroline Lee Bouvier, who tied the knot with Polish Prince Stanislaw Albrecht Radziwill; and Rita Hayworth, who in 1949 married Italian-born Prince Ali Salman Aga Khan.
Markle is also walking in the footsteps of Grace Kelly who, just like the Suits star, was a screen star before she became royalty.
Kelly stopped her acting career to marry Prince Rainier III of Monaco in 1956, a move echoed six decades later by Meghan, who left Suits shortly after her engagement to Prince Harry was announced.
