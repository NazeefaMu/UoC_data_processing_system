Shakespeare’s dramas: Heart in flowers and soul in their Brilliance

So colossal were their impact on all his plays, poetry and prose that made other poets appear dull and listless when nature in her glory offered the best of all four seasons so much so that even winter had little flowers peering through crevices in search of daylight only to die upon winter blast but not before Shakespeare caught a glimpse of them. He was able to appreciate their contribution in some small way.
Over twenty-nine scenes containing flowers and foliage are found in his writing adding so much beauty and character upon his wondrous writings.
He was such an accurate observer never missing any detail as to their individuality that made him a natural botanist. Botany, pollination, horticulture and plant maintenance were never heard of during his lifetime nor were the study of plants that made him the starter to give impetus to people about planting and caring for them that made it a huge international industry, employing thousands of workers worldwide for research and commercial purposes and countries like England and Japan leading the way with flowers for occasions, churches, wedding etc., Today it is a booming industry.
He was by birth and instinct a countryman and raised in the native Warwickshire among the rising cliffs and valleys and pastoral scenes, watching the wonders of the changing seasons along with the environment that made early impressions in his young mind he carried through to his writings. His parents from both sides belonged to farming families and not far from his birthplace, Stratford - upon - Avon which at that time was a little market town.
It linked the River Avon the poet cherished, holding back memories with snow-white gliding swans beside the open fields and pastures. As he grew up in the freshness of the rural and left behind Stratford when London beckoned him where he made his fortune and name as a poet, Shakespeare remained the man from the native village that divided the Arden woodlands and forests. Very often he wandered in the land at Welcomed on her rising ground looking beyond the river valley and perhaps made his fortune as playwright and part owner of the Globe Theatre.
He excelled his exquisite expressions of varied emotions linking many a character to each other that became his powerful signature we were to study two centuries later in our classrooms. Look at the romantic settings he used in AS YOU LIKE IT with the lush freshness of the Avon Meadows and the wooded landscape of the Arden forest clearly display Shakespeare’s inspiration from nature as no other would have.
The drowning Ophelia has left an indelible impression in our minds clinging to flowers, garlanding herself and her hair which later became the subject for iconic painters to put her on canvas, paintings fetching millions of pounds for originals.
PANSIES: No one knows why the Bard loved this small wildflower so much as to christen it with more names such as ‘Heartsease’ and ‘Love-in-idleness’ and feature it in Hamlet, The Taming of the Shrew as well as in ‘A Midsummer Night’s Dream. One reason can be that they came in abundance in the fields of Warwickshire dressed in purple, yellow and white throughout Spring and Summer. Many of the modern varieties of the pansy is derived from the wild pansies of Shakespeare’s time. In Hamlet, he says;-
‘And there is Pansies, that’s for thoughts’
DAFFODILS: Symbolises the joy of youth as spoken by Autolycus and Perdita. They convey the freshness of Spring and the glory of March, found in woodlands and meadows as Shakespeare describe them in Winter’s Tale,:
‘When daffodils begin to peer,
With hey, the doxy over the dale,
Why then comes in the sweets o’ the year
For the red blood reigns in the winter’ pale:
LILIES: For the most part of his works where the Bard had to use flowers for description, lilies and roses took priority, the former being very close to his heart as he put life into many of the characters. Shakespeare many have influenced the rose to become the national flower of England.
‘To gild refined gold, to paint the lily,
To throw a perfume on the violet……..
Is wasteful and ridiculous’.
OXLIPS: When poet wanted to suggest the tall confident character of a player, he opted to use the brilliance found in Oxlips which closely resemble Cowslip that is found in Warwickshire during Spring. He best describes them IN A MIDSUMMER NIGHT’S DREAM:
‘I know a bank where the wild thyme blows,
Where Oxlips and the nodding violet grows,
Quiet over-canopied with luscious woodbine,
With sweet musk-rose, and with eglantine.
There sleeps Titania sometime of night,
Lulled in these flowers with dance and delight’
The cowslip blooms in early spring particularly on wayside verge that the poet would have seen in every spring of his life. The song Ariel sings would have merged from the old pastures, now set to nursery rhyme which I still remember clearly and hum without missing a word:
‘Where the bee sucks, there suck I
In a cowslip’s bell I lie.
There I couch when owls do cry.
On the bat’s back I do fly
After summer merrily….’
Beautiful and simple and are these not wonders of a child’s world of imagination that Shakespeare wrote for them with flying bats, sleeping fairies, crying owls surrounded by nature and her flowers of spring. I can count up to twenty-five flowers named by the poet across his plays and they are all found in the woodlands of Warwickshire during the four seasons and belong to the Bard, I suppose. The ones used in the article are Pansies, Daffodils, Lilies and Oxlips and their photographs original.
For children, he was a favourite in the only play written from them. In TEMPEST, he uses the cowslip where Ariel would curl and lie, denoting their Size.
