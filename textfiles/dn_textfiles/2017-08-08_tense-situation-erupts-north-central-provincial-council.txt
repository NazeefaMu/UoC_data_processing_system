Tense situation erupts at North Central Provincial Council

 
A tense situation erupted at the North Central Provincial Council this morning when members of the Joint Opposition (JO) set fire to a copy of the session’s agenda.
This action was against the newly-appointed Provincial Council Chairman.
United National Party (UNP) Councilor D.M. Amaratunge was elected as the NCPC Chairman on July 18 after former NCPC Chairman T.M.R. Siripala was forced to step down from the post following a no confidence motion presented by 11 UNP provincial council members on the same day.
