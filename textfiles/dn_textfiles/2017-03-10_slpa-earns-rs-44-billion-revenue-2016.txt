SLPA earns Rs. 44 billion revenue in 2016

Net profit Rs. 11 billion
 The Sri Lanka Ports Authority (SLPA) has earned a revenue of Rs. 44 billion and of it a net profit of Rs. 11 billion during the last financial year (2016), Ports and Shipping Minister Arjuna Ranatunga said.
However, of the Rs. 44 billion revenue, the expenditure was Rs. 20.2 billion during the period.
The Minister was addressing the media yesterday at the Port Ministry.
Moreover, the SLPA has paid an amount of Rs. 7.1 billion (Rs. 7,100 million) as installments and the interest for the loan obtained for Hambantota Mahinda Rajapaksa Port during the last financial year.
Minister Ranatunga said Rs. 17,000 million had been paid by the SLFP during the last financial year for loans obtained and for other liabilities. He added that there is a gradual increase in the net profit and the total revenue when compared to previous years.
“The SLPA increased the revenue as a result of a collective measure to increase the productivity and measures taken to minimize fraud and monetary misconducts,” he said.
When the Minister was asked about plans for the Hambantota Port, he said the SLPA is looking forward to carry through with the best option. Accordingly, the SLFP will compromise for the best option.
“We have achieved a fruitful outcome by now in connection with the Hambantota Port. We are still engaged with it to get the best plan running. We have done well so far,” he said.
However, within the next 10 days, the SLPA will finalize the project, he added.
The Minister noted that the Galle and Trincomalee Ports are making a profit now after a lapse of several years as a result of mitigating fraud and financial misconduct.
Speaking on the Eastern Terminal of the Colombo Port, the Minister said the SLPA is looking forward for an investor aiming to develop it further. He said machinery will be ordered for the Eastern Terminal. The Eastern Terminal can be extended to 1,200 metres with the assistance of the private sector investors. It is hoped to run the terminal as a public-private entity.
Speaking on the present situation of the Jaya Container Terminal (JCT), Minister Ranatunga said that the depth of the jetty is not sufficient for most modern large vessels. The cranes of the JCT are not modern.
 
“We have to install modern machinery especially modern cranes in place of old cranes. The SLPA will place an order for new cranes this year and the SLPA will receive the new cranes by next year,” he said.
