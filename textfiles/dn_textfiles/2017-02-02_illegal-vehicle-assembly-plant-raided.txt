A team of officials from the Walana Central Anti Frauds Bureau in a joint operation with Sri Lanka Customs Central Investigation Bureau raided a vehicle assembly plant in the Minuwangoda Industrial Park and seized 54 vehicles assembled with parts imported illegally on January 31.
The vehicles were handed over to the Assistant Director of Customs who accompanied the Customs team as they identified the vehicles as illegal vehicles.
This follows a petition received by Police alleging that a company in the Minuwangoda Industrial zone known as ‘Vehicle Lanka Private Ltd’ had deprived the government of nearly Rs 325 million in Customs duties by importing vehicle parts illegally to locally assemble vehicles. Acting on this petition DIG Ranmal Kodituwakku directed the Walana anti-frauds unit to investigate the matter said a press release by Police headquarters yesterday.
The release said investigations revealed that there were fully assembled vehicles kept for sale at this plant as well as vehicles awaiting the fixing of engines and vehicles returned after sale at this yard belonging to the plant. According to information provided by Customs the Vehicle Lanka Private Ltd Plant had assembled vehicles before the imported parts were released by Customs.
The illegal import of these vehicle parts had deprived the Government of nearly Rs 325 million in Customs duty.
The raid was successfully conducted by the Police and Customs on the directions of IGP Ranjith Jayasundera and the supervision of Walana Anti Frauds Unit Acting Director ASP D.G.H. Prashantha.
Police said if any persons had fallen victim to this fraud by purchasing vehicles from this company they should contact the Walana anti frauds unit personally or on telephone 038-2234314 or 039-2234315.
