BMS emerge Red Bull Campus Cricket Champs

Business Management School of Sri Lanka became the Champions of fifth World-Final of Red Bull Campus Cricket, when they beat University of Liberal Arts Bangladesh by 24 runs in the finals concluded on Sunday the 11th September at Galle International Stadium.
University of Liberal Arts Bangladesh winning the toss put BMS in, allowing their pace-attack to snatch the initiative. BMS were badly hit as far as their batting was concerned since they did not have the services of their top three key-players, Shehan Jayasuriya, Niroshan Dickwella and Bhanuka Rajapaksha in this all important final, but the advent of Dhananjaya de Silva and Dasun Shanaka into the side fresh from their national duties with the Sri Lanka team filled the void created to certain extent.
Though BMS lost their skipper, Geshan Wimaladharma after a short cameo at the top, Dhananjaya pushed BMS past fifty reaching a reasonable power-play score before BMS lost two more wickets in short intervals including the price-wicket of Janith Liyanage, a good-finisher who was unfortunately run-out after scoring just two runs. At a time Dhananjaya was losing his partners he found a partner in Dasun Shanaka to rebuild their innings carrying BMS to 91 for three halfway through their innings. Shanaka chipped in with a 15-ball 19 before both Shanaka and Dhananjaya lost their wickets when BMS’s total was 92 handing the second half of their lineup the responsibility of making a sizable total for their bowlers to bowl at. Dhananjaya anchored the innings with a brisk 32 in 24 balls with three sixes, but his dismissal cost Sri Lankan team the momentum required for a match-winning total.
Business Management School : 191/9 in 20 overs (Ranitha Liyanarachchi 52, Dhananjaya de Silva 32, Dasun Shanaka 19, Geshan Wimaladharma 17, Arifur Rahman 3/20, Mohammed Islam 2/22)
University of Liberal Arts Bangladesh : 167/8 in 20 overs (MD Hasanuzzaman 39, Avishek Mitra 28, Maraj Niloy 20, Koshan Jayawickrama 4/27, Chamika Karunarathne 2/17)
