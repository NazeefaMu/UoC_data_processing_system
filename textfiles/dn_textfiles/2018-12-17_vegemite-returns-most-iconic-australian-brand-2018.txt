Vegemite returns  as the Most Iconic  Australian Brand 2018

Vegemite returned as the Most Iconic Australian Brand 2018 according to the 19th Reader’s Digest annual list of Most Trusted Brands.
The results come from the independently conducted Trusted Brands Survey by Catalyst- a search and social marketing agency of GroupM in North America. Each year the results appear exclusively in the Australian Reader’s Digest and more than 2,400 Australians took part in the poll. Vegemite has a history spanning over 90 years. Back in 1922, cheese maker & food manufacturer Fred Walker joined forces with a young chemist and food technologist Cyril Percy Callister to produce a yeast-based savory spread. Originally this product was called ‘Pure Vegetable Extract’, and after a nation-wide naming competition, Walker’s daughter selected the winning name “Vegemite”. Fast forward to today and Vegemite is 94 years old, and it’s become one of the country’s most ‘Australian’ foods. Over 22 million jars are sold and 6,800 tones are produced each year.
As one of Sri Lanka’s leading suppliers of Fast-Moving Consumer Goods (FMCG) and bakery ingredient products, East West Marketing proudly present this world-renowned brand Vegemite to domestic market with the objective of giving truly world class and high-quality food ingredients to Sri Lankan consumers which makes supports in their busy life styles. The spread has also been prescribed by doctors as a vitamin B supplement. One serving provides 25-50% recommended daily intake of folate, vitamin B1, B2, and B3 (also known as thiamin, riboflavin, and niacin). B vitamins are water soluble and important components in metabolic processes to create energy for the entire body. Responding to the preferences of consumers, Vegemite is ideally suited for vegetarians as it does not contain any animal derived ingredients.
