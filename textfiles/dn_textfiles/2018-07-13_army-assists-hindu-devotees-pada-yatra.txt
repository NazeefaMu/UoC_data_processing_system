Army assists Hindu devotees on pada yatra

Fostering religious harmony is a must for the development of the country without allowing it to revert to war again, Army Commander Lt. Gen. Mahesh Senanayake said.
The Army Commander expressed these sentiments when he visited Yala No 2 zone to look into the welfare of Hindu devotees from the North who were on a pada yatra to Kataragama on July 11.
The Army Commander who said it was the duty of the Army to act as trustees of the pada yatra pilgrims enroute to Kataragama, added that the people should understand the value of the humanitarian services undertaken by the Army towards their well-being.
The ancient tradition of bringing the produce of land dedicated to God Kataragama in caravans for offering at the Kataragama Maha Devalaya is being still continued by a minority of Hindu devotees.
