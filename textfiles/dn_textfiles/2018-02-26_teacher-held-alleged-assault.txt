Teacher held for alleged assault

A sports teacher of Nayapana Vidyalaya in Nugawela, who allegedly assaulted a school girl causing her injury, was arrested last Saturday.
The alleged incident occurred when the student attempted to return home without staying for after-school netball practices.
The student was admitted to the Gampola Hospital. She was then transferred to the Kandy Hospital for further examination and later sent to the Gampola Hospital.
The arrest was made consequent to a complaint lodged at the Pussallawa Police Station by a school teacher and the guardians of the girl.
It was also reported that there is a case currently in court against this teacher in connection with the abuse of a school boy on a previous occasion.
