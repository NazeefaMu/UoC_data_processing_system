Review of Sri Lanka-England ODI series: Two wins in two months

 
In 2014 when Sri Lanka won the five-match ODI series in England (3-2) their bowling unit comprised the incomparable Lasith Malinga, Nuwan Kulasekara, Sachitra Senanayake and Ajantha Mendis and their batting line up had the experience of Tillakaratne Dilshan, Kumar Sangakkara and Mahela Jayawardene.
None of these players figured in the recently concluded five-match ODI series against England which Sri Lanka lost (0-3). Some had retired, while others had lost their form or were injured or unavailable.
In the circumstances Angelo Mathews who savoured victory in all three formats as captain in 2014 had to taste the bitter pill on this occasion as his young team were beaten not only in the ODI series but also lost the three-Test series 0-2 and the one-off T20 international. Thus on the current tour that lasted for two months what Mathews and his boys had to show was a mere two wins against associate member Ireland.
In other words Mathews as captain has tasted victory as well as defeat in two successive tours to England which is what this game of cricket is all about. One hopes the lessons learnt from them would make him a better captain for the future with steely determination.
Michael Vaughan the former England captain described the present English ODI team as “the best in a generation”.
“This is the best England ODI side I have seen us have by a country mile,” Vaughan said, “This side are fantastic to watch - they have options, combinations, power, mystery, a great attitude and genuine world-class players.” So to lose to an England side of that caliber is of no disgrace, but what is important from Sri Lanka’s point of view is whether they have learnt their lessons from the defeat so that the mistakes they made during the series are not repeated in the future.
Since a miserable World Cup in 2015 England’s limited-overs teams have been transformed under coach Trevor Bayliss and his assistant Paul Farbrace – both of whom at different times been head coach of the Sri Lanka team.
Since being eliminated at the group stage of the last 50-over World Cup, England have consistently posted scores in excess of 300 - even topping 400 against New Zealand last summer and won three of their five ODI series, losing only to world champions Australia and South Africa, both 3-2 and reaching the final of the World T20 this year.
Against Sri Lanka, five English batsmen finished the series scoring at more than a run a ball, with only one - Jonny Bairstow (89) - having a strike-rate below 90.
Sri Lanka had three batsmen with a strike rate of over a run a ball, but one of their top batters vice-captain Dinesh Chandimal did not do his team any justice scoring at a rate of 79.46. Even Mathews (84.61) and Kusal Perera (70.64) had very poor strike rates when compared to England’s. Perera returning to international cricket after a six-month doping suspension failed to find his touch although he had come into the series on the back of an aggressive 135 against Ireland.
His highest score was 37 and his early dismissals exposed the youngest member of the team 21-year-old Kusal Mendis to England firing line early in the innings. To the credit of Mendis he batted with fortitude and was never afraid to take the fight to the England bowlers finishing the series with two half-centuries.
The other youngster to impress was opener Danushka Gunathilaka who in the absence of Tillakaratne Dilshan (unavailable for the series) showed that he was developing nicely into filling that opening slot when Dilshan retires. He showed positive intent in his approach to score at a run a ball and he also proved a useful off-spinner capturing wickets at crucial stages. On flat pitches the Lankan bowlers were badly exposed. They lacked variety and penetration whereas England had a mixed bag which they were able to throw against Sri Lanka and strangle their free scoring batsmen.
Mathews would always say that winning the first match of any series was important. Sri Lanka nearly did that at Trent Bridge. They had England on their knees at 82-6 chasing a target of 287 but allowed them get out of jail and earn a sensational tie.
That sort of fightback to come back from the dead so to say when all seemed lost boosted the morale and confidence of the England camp skyhigh and they never looked back from there onwards. England went from strength to strength and Sri Lanka was always trailing behind trying to play catch-up cricket.
Had Sri Lanka won that first ODI who knows their world would have been a whole lot different.
