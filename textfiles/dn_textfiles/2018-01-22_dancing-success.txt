Dancing to success

Dance World Studio recently made a journey of epic proportions when they made the trip to Dance Excellence 2017 in Los Angeles. It is an award winning studio in Sri Lanka. These outstanding individuals have certainly made their country proud.
An event was held last week to honor these students and appreciate their commitment and dedication to this studio that they love. It was attended by Sports Minister Dayasiri Jayasekara. “DANCEWORLD was also invited to showcase their talents on the legendary Fantasyland Stage at Disneyland, Los Angeles. A first for Sri Lanka, DANCEWORLD dancers gave a unique performance that left the international audience mesmerized and placed Sri Lanka, quite literally on the world stage of entertainment," said Creative Director of Dance World Shaan Deen.
It was an incredible journey made possible by the concentrated efforts of the entire DANCEWORLD Management Team – DanceWorld Founding partner and Artistic Director Sureka Gunawardena Buell, Partner/ Business Director Shaanee Deen Olegard and Creative Consultant to the studio Shaan Deen “In recognition of the studio’s outstanding work in dance and performance, Dance Excellence invited DANCEWORLD from a select number of Studios from around the world to take part in a festival of expression and movement. Dance Excellence also coordinates with leaders in the entertainment industry of Hollywood and DANCEWORLD was privileged to have attended workshops headed by Choreographers, Producers and Directors who have worked with some A-list Celebrities as Beyoncé, Lady Gaga and Rihanna to name a few,” explained Shaan Deen. These particular dancers of Dance World have pushed the limits of physical endurance, inspired hard work and determination amongst their fellow students and continue to give their most passionate performances, every step of the way.
“One of the main highlights of DANCEWORLD’S trip to Los Angeles was a surprising sweep at the Dance Excellence Awards Gala where the Studio received a total of 5 Awards for outstanding performances - in various Categories at the International Performance Boards. We want to pay special tribute to DANCEWORLD’s Long-Term Students some of whom have been with the studio for more than 5 and up to 12 years. Giving nothing short of their very best throughout the years,” said DanceWorld Founding partner and Artistic Director Sureka Gunawardena Buell.
