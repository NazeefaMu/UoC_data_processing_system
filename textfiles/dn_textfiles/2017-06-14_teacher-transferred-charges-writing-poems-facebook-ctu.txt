Teacher transferred on charges of writing poems to Facebook: CTU

Ceylon Teachers’ Union (CTU) Chairman Joseph Starling said a male teacher of the Kuliyapitiya Central College has been transferred to Narammala Central College on charges of writing poems to Facebook.
Starling said the teacher, who taught technology at the Kuliyapitiya Central College, has been writing poems to his Facebook page as a habit.
The teacher has been transferred as poems written on the education sector have hurt some education and political leaders,” he said. National School Director Jayantha Wickremanayake said the teacher has been transferred not in connection with his Facebook post, but as part of a disciplinary action.
An inquiry is being carried out into a misconduct of the teacher by the Education Ministry. The transfer is part of that inquiry,” he said.
Wickremanayake said: “The Teacher Transfer Board’s approval is needed for a normal teacher transfer, but this is a special case as the teacher has been transferred to make room for the smooth conduct of the inquiry.”
