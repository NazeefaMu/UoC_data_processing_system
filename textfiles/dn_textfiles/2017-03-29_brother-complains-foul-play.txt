Paramasivam said his sister, a mother of three separated from her husband, left the country on October 12, 2015 for employment in Saudi Arabia through an agency. Although they communicated with her for about six months, since then they had lost contact.
On November 1, 2016, they got a WhatsApp message from a Sri Lankan woman in Saudi Arabia saying that his sister died after languishing in the Oleya Baba Detention Camp in Riyadh in a serious conditions.
On November 8, 2016, the Sri Lanka Embassy in Riyad confirmed his sister’s death.
