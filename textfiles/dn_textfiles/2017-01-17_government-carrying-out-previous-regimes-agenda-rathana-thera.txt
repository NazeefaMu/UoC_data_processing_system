Government carrying out previous regimes agenda: Rathana Thera

The previous government made plans to give lands to China but could not implement it. It is regrettable however, to see that this government is implementing it and doing what the previous government was planning to do, Senior Consultant to the President and MP Ven. Athuraliye Rathana Thera said.
Addressing a media briefing at the Sri Lanka Foundation Institute in Colombo yesterday he said the former President cannot contest for the presidency again and cannot win an election.
The government should not over engage with China. According to Ven. Rathana Thera, now the past is behind us and terrorism is defeated, no matter who likes or hates it. “It is not worth to imprison war heroes in order to obtain the GSP Plus. The UNP said it will implement a social market economy but now they are engaged in selling state assets without consulting anyone. Handing over Hambantota harbour to China on a 99 year lease is a serious crime. A National Policy Council should take the decision on what should be given to whom. Parts of the country cannot be handed over to foreign countries,” he said.
“The UNP should be focused on the colour of their party when taking decisions in connection with the development of the country. It is a huge mistake If we lose our environment in the name of development. We do not need to make another Singapore in Sri Lanka because Singapore is similar to the CMC in size and do not have water to drink. Instead of making Sri Lanka another Singapore, the Prime Minister should be focused on protecting the environment and promoting eco-tourism,” said Rathana Thera.
