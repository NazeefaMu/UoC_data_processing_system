Good morning on this great Monday. Strap on some binoculars and slip on a pair of walking shoes. (And bring an umbrella, just in case.)Come, let's go watch some Unidentified Flying Organisms.
If you are lucky you would not need to walk far. Stand still in a corner of your garden, watch, listen, and observe. Chances are you will detect at least five or six feathered visitors moving gracefully among the shrubs, trees, and flowers, breaking into magical songs every now and then, staying still in silent meditation or coming together for an early morning board meeting on a telephone wire.
Apart from the occasional crow who might have wanted to share your lunch with you, if you had not had much exposure to these dinosaur descendants, high time you looked out the window and spotted one right this minute.
Here's why: according to a research paper in the Bioscience journal, lower levels of depression, anxiety and stress are associated with the number of birds people could see on any given day, especially during the afternoons, (regardless of what species of birds they were looking at). Previous studies have also put the change in well-being down to the fact that people feel relaxed and connected to nature when looking at birds and trees.
In other words, what better way to relax and unwind than watching beautiful, peaceful birds – and, of course, the squirrels and other wildlife that frequent your garden. You don't need to be a sage to realize it’s nearly impossible to worry about deadlines, rude drivers, family concerns, or even the ISIS crisis when you lose yourself in a world of colorful feathers and beautiful sounds.
Sight and sound
So, among the multitude of reasons you might like to see birds in your garden, the principle—and most rewarding one—is that you enjoy the sight and sound of them. All other reasons largely pale in comparison to the amount of enjoyment you will get from simply having interesting bird species visiting your yard.
Then again, birds are voracious pest eaters too. While some are happy to alight on a feeder you have placed out for them and have a feast, others are just as happy to hop about your yard picking off slugs, bugs, and other crawlies while they are waiting in line. Even better, species of birds that may not be attracted to the type of food you have laid out for them, will nevertheless stop by because the presence of other birds gives them a sense of safety.
On top of enjoying their song and the fruits of their bug-snatching labors, you also get a chance to participate in the ecosystem of the birds. Most of the birds you will feed and see will be fairly common to your locale, but every so often you get the reward of seeing something unusual—like an Indian Pitta —stop in your yard to fuel up on its incredible journey away from the cold Himalayan forests in winter.
So where should you get started? If you'd like to see more wildlife of the feathered kind in your backyard but had written off attracting birds as too time-consuming, expensive, or complicated, think again. Birds have really basic needs, and providing for them is not costly at all.
Needs of birds
As Jason Fitzpatrick writes in his article 'How to Turn your Backyard into a Bird Refuge', birds need food, water, shelter, and nesting materials. These things can be provided in as simple a fashion as a banana on a parapet wall, a pan of water, a bush to hop into, and an old clay pot with a hole in the middle hung on the wall. Of course, if your tastes or your budget are so inclined, you can go wild buying all manner of fancy feeders, nesting boxes, baths, too, but this is not strictly necessary.
Mainly because a bird can hardly tell the difference between a costly bird's house and a discarded clay pot. Experts suggest you should get started quickly and inexpensively, and that you can decide later if you want to open a five-star bird hotel with fountain-baths and a rotating buffet of handmade treats.
“Birds love water”, says Fitzpatrik. “Once they figure out you have got some sort of water source in your yard, they will be there every day drinking, splashing, and preening in it. You don't need a backyard pond or a massive water fountain to attract birds to your yard. Even a modest source of water will do just fine as long as you do the right things to grab their attention.” Nearly anything can serve as a birdbath as long as you keep a few design elements in mind. Your bird bath should be shallow. It can have a "deep end" but most of the bath should be shallow enough for small birds like sparrows to stand comfortably. The bath should be located with plenty of escape routes nearby. Bathing makes it harder for a bird to make a speedy escape and increase the chance a predator will snatch them. Make sure to put the birdbath in a location that is either safe from most predators—as it would be high up on an apartment balcony—or provides plenty of low hanging branches or other easy to reach roosts in case the birds need to bolt.
Compared to providing food and water, providing any sort of elaborate shelter is significantly less important. You can attract plenty of birds to your yard with some inexpensive feed, and a source of water. That said there are two kinds of shelter you should keep in mind when planning on drawing birds into your yard.
If you are looking to help birds become not just diners but permanent residents of your budding bird sanctuary, some sort of shelter beyond just bushes and accessible overhangs is in order. You can buy bird houses or make them yourself. The key thing to keep in mind regarding bird houses is that birds really don't care what the bird house looks like. “All a bird needs is a hole just the right size for it to wiggle in and a decent sized inner cavity once it gets inside. Whether that cavity is inside an old tree or a gaudy birdhouse shaped like a pink Cadillac isn't of any interest to the bird,” advises Fitzpatrick.
Benefits
Finally, when everything is in order, you will realize making lifew easier for birds is a win-win. As said before, bird-watching can boost your mental outlook, decrease stress, improve work performance, and even help improve kids' attention spans.
On the flip side, turning your yard into a five-star dining experience for our feathered friends helps alleviate some of the hardships they are enduring—things largely caused by people in the first place—such as habitat loss and climate change. As bird-watcher Sher Jay says, “The thing about birding is that nothing can prepare you for it, but it profoundly changes the way you look at the world.
You will never realize how much beauty, diversity and wonder you have been missing right before your eyes, daily, until you begin birding. It makes you pay attention and focus swiftly on minutiae, it anchors you in the present tense, amplifies all your senses, and it helps you perceive everything as important, particularly because every encounter is so fleeting. You grow tolerant of changing externalities that you have no control over, and if you are anything like me, you finally learn to tweet outside the realm of Twitter. The best part of being a new birder is that every bird is an unidentified flying organism to you; it’s a brave new world, inhabited by curious, alien, aerodynamic works of art that are well worth exploring!”
So what are you waiting for? Get birding!
