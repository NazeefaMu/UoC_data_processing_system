Geotech Testing Services awarded ISO 9001:2008 certification

Geotech Testing Services which has introduced state of the art electronic pile testing techniques to Sri Lanka from 1996 was awarded the ISO 9001:2008 certification from the Sri Lanka Standards Institution.
This is the first company involved in electronic pile testing in Sri Lanka to be so recognised.
A pile is a post like foundation member of timber, steel or concrete driven into the ground to support a structure. It is an indispensable building support on unstable soils and is also used on stable ground to support large structural loads.
They are driven to the ground by machines which drop heavy weights on the pile. However, due to this procedure and other factors some piles do become faulty.
Traditional methods to check the condition of a driven pile were expensive and not very effective. Electronic pile testing has been responsible for upgrading the quality of piling works undertaken in Sri Lanka by providing an economical and convenient quality assurance tool.
Geotech Testing Services introduced the increasingly complex and useful electronic pile testing systems from the developers and manufacturers of the equipment as well as the analytical software, Messrs Pile Dynamics Inc. of Ohio USA.
Commencing from the basic Pile Integrity Tester to the Pile Dynamic Analyzer were introduced over the years. The different testing systems provide a wealth of reliable data hitherto unavailable through traditional pile testing methods. Their value as a quality assurance tool and a means of optimizing the foundation designs have been proven without doubt.
Thus, the electronic pile testing technology is now well accepted and adopted in the construction Industry in Sri Lanka.
It is essential that the reliability of the data and results generated by the testing techniques be accurate and reliable in order to maintain the trust and confidence of the stake holders of the construction industry.
The successful certification of the Company and its operations by the ISO 9001:2008 quality assurance system is an assurance to all of the reliability of Geotech Testing Services as a competent and dependable service provider for state of the art electronic pile testing services.
Geotech Testing Services is a member of the Geotech Group with Geotech and Group Engineering Laboratories, laboratory service providers for the geotechnical and construction industry.
