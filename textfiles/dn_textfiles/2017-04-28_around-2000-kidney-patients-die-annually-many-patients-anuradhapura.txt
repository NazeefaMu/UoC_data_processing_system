Around 2,000 kidney patients die annually Many patients from Anuradhapura, Polonnaruwa:

About 20,000 Sri Lankans are hospitalised annually due to kidney diseases. Around 2,000 of them die, Health Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne said.
Minister Dr. Senaratne expressed these views during a recent ceremony in Colombo.
According to Minister Dr. Senaratne, the number of patients who suffer from Chronic Kidney Disease of Unknown Origin (CKDU) is around 38,000. Around 4,000 CKDU patients were reported from the Anuradhapura and Polonnaruwa districts during the past four years.
Minister Dr. Senaratne said research on CKDU commenced in 2008. A Presidential Task Force on the issue was set up in 2014.
Malnutrition and Anaemia are two common health issues among kidney patients. The lives of kidney patients can be uplifted through proper nutrition, he said.
Plans are being made to recruit 300 nutritionists to the Health Ministry. The country needs more nutritionists to look after the health of kidney patients and the food habits of the patients who suffer from Non Communicable Diseases (NCDs), Dr. Senaratne said.
