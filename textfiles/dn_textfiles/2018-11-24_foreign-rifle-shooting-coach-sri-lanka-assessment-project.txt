Foreign Rifle shooting coach in Sri Lanka on assessment project

The National Shooting Sports Federation of Sri Lanka (NSSF) has brought down Elham Hashemi Masoumi, an ‘A’ Grade ISSF License coach, to conduct an assessment and training programme for the Sri Lankan Rifle shooters.
The two-day project, conducted at the Scorpion Rifle Shooting Club range in Malabe, was held on Friday and Saturday, and depending on the report provided by Elham, the NSSF will move forward in obtaining the expertise of Elham as a foreign coach.
“This is a timely effort made by the NSSF, to bring down an international coach. The two-day programme is a very good move in terms of exploring where local shooters stand in the international arena, through a pair of eyes of an international expert. We have 18 shooters, who have represented Sri Lanka and top performers at national events and five coaches, who will attend the practical and boardroom sessions conducted by Ms. Elham,” stated Retired Major General Kenneth Edema, a shooting stalwart in Sri Lanka.
The highly qualified Iranian coach will assess the local shooters for two days and also conduct lectures at the Malabe property, before her final assessment report is presented to Shirantha Peries, the President of NSSF.
“I’m supposed to see the facilities and the performances of the shooters, to see if I can help or not. Of course some of the equipments are weak and I’m writing down the notes on what should be done. Of course, as I see improvement is possible,” Elham, a former Iran national shooter, stated.
In the assessment report Ms. Elham will also mention that if she finds it suitable to provide her expertise as an ISSF (International Shooting Sports Federation ) ‘A’ License coach, which looks positive after the first session on the first day. Elham, a penchant in accepting challenges, has coached her native country Iran for years since 2010 and helped Singapore reach international standards as national coach from 2015 to 2018. Elham’s visit and assessment programme is sponsored by the Clay Target Shooting Club of Colombo.
