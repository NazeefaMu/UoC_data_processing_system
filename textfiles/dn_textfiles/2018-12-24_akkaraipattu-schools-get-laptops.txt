Akkaraipattu schools get laptops

The Akkaraipattu Zonal Education Office distributed laptops to 22 selected schools in the Akkaraipattu Educational Zone, recently.
Schools in Akkaraipattu, Addalaichenai and Pottuvil under the Akkaraipattu Educational Zone benefitted from this programme.
The function was held at the Akkaraipattu Zonal Education Office auditorium.
In schools which had no laptops, the Education Ministry distributed laptops, dongles, laptop bags, mouses and mouse pads. The equipment was presented to school principals by Akkaraipattu Zonal Education Director A.M. Rahmathullah, Deputy Education Directors A.H. Fous (Development), A.G. Fasmil (Planning) and Accountant K. Lingeswaran. Rahmathullah requested principals to ensure students get the benefit of computer practicals.
He said the results achieved by students of this educational zone in the GCE O/L, A/L and Grade 5 examinations were commendable.
