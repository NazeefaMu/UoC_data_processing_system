Aloysius’s revision petition fixed for further argument on July 4

A revision application filed by Perpetual Treasuries Limited (PTL) beneficiary owner Arjun Aloysius and its Chief Executive Officer Kasun Palisena seeking an Interim Order to release them on bail was yesterday fixed for further argument on July 4 by the Court of Appeal.
Senior Additional Solicitor General Yasantha Kodagoda PC appearing for the Attorney General informed Court that there is no illegality in the order made by the Colombo Fort Magistrate regarding suspects’ bail. He further submitted to court that the petitioners have no legal rights to invoke Court Appeal’s jurisdiction through a revision petition.
President’s Counsel Gamini Marapana had informed Court that the prosecutors have followed an illegal procedure by presenting the Presidential Commission into the Central Bank Bond issue before the Magistrate in order to contaminate the Magistrate’s mind. He argued that bail has been refused after perusing the recommendations made by the Presidential Commission without having a proper magisterial inquiry into the issue.
When the matter came up before Court of Appeal (President) Preethi Padman Surasena and Justice Shiran Goonaratne, the matter was fixed for further argument on July 4.
The suspects were remanded in connection with the controversial Central Bank Bond issuance.
Arjun Aloysius states that by his application he was seeking Court’s Jurisdiction to set aside the order dated March 9, 2018 of the Colombo High Court in Revision Application No. HCRA 22/2018.
The High Court refused notice in the Revision Application for affirming order dated 16-02-2018 made by the Magistrate’s Court of Fort in proceedings bearing No.B/8266/18, refusing the grant of Bail and committing the Petitioner to remand custody.
Aloysius states that he was arrested and produced before the Magistrate’s Court of Fort on February 4, 2018 and committed to remand custody by the Magistrate’s Court of Fort on February 4 and February 16 and thereafter, at the behest of and on the strength of further reports filed by the Criminal Investigation Department, in connection with an investigation commenced upon a complaint dated 25-11-2016, made by the Governor of the Central Bank of Sri Lanka.
