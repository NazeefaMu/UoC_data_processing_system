They want to break free

Painters are bestowed with the talent of treading beyond norms demarcated by the society. They, being a rare breed, thus stimulate philosophical thinking within people with their vivid creations.
Yet, how does an ‘Abstract expressionistic style’ of painting sans human figures appeal to people in this three-dimensional lonely planet? People here are so accustomed to three dimensional and tangible objects and life forms.
“The universe is enormous. According to Buddhist teachings, many galaxies and unseen worlds and beings with different dimensions prevail in this universe. If so how can we draw three-dimensional human figures and pronounce that they have universal appeal?” opines Sarath Gunasiri Perera, who is the Head of the department of painting, faculty of visual arts at the University of Visual and Performing Arts in Sri Lanka.
Must see
An exhibition of paintings named ‘Trilogy’ consisting abstract expressionistic style of paintings done by the threesome, Sarath Gunasiri Perera, Dr R M Dharmasena and Honduras based Santos Arzu Quioto is now being held at the J D A Perera Gallery, Horton Place, Colombo 7.
The exhibition will remain open till October 13.
Trilogy could be endorsed as a ‘must see’ exhibition of paintings for philosophical thinkers and truth seekers. The composition of the works of these three artists is food for thought for budding artists and students.
“Our teaming up to hold this exhibition happened unexpectedly. Dr R M Dharmasena was my mentor at the faculty of visual arts. He guided me to move away from representing solid figures to indulge in this type of paintings.
I met Santos Arzu Quioto who is from Central America at an art symposium held in South Korea in 2014. On discovering our pursuit towards finding solace and happiness is so similar, we teamed up to unleash our inner feelings and philosophies via Trilogy exhibition”, says Sarath Gunasiri Perera.
Mystical ability
Every brush stroke, every incident in a drawing isn’t a coincidence for these three artists. They have the mystical ability to create matching dimensions with their original thoughts and philosophies.
By awakening to the path of innovation, Sarath has held his solo exhibition, ‘In Search of Freedom’ in 2014.
Santos Arzu is a painter who has held solo exhibitions in many countries deriving enormous exposure. His academic background in sociology has contributed immensely towards his artistic creations.
Santos has more than 25 solo art exhibitions to his credit held in countries, Honduras, Estados Unidos, República Dominicana, Argentina, Perú, Colombia, Italy and China. He has had over 40 group exhibitions in Central America, México, Cuba, South Africa, France, Spain, Argentina, Brazil and South Korea.
Dimensional universe
“Geometric shapes and designs become a hoax when we think beyond a three-dimensional universe”, says Santos.
Though there are various similarities between the works of these three artists, Sarath makes his works unique by selecting soothing colours while maintaining the composition in each of his paintings. Santos uses vivid colours and gigantic creations to express his feelings.
Dr R M Dharmasena, former lecturer and the Head of the department of painting, faculty of visual arts, at the University being the third member in the team says, “I am very much concerned with the equilibrium of my paintings with the colour scheme so as to evaluate it in spite of not being titled”.
“Colour harmony and space can penetrate the human soul. A viewer should have an open mind to see the whole of a painting. He could also add his inner thoughts and expand the horizons of a painting which is not confined by lines”, he adds.
These three artists are on a quest to find the hidden truth behind the nonfigurative in the language of painting. Their paintings are untitled and the viewers have the freedom to title them according to their whims and fancies by proceeding to new vistas of freedom.
Their paintings also are not price-tagged but collectors with a passion for real paintings could value them.
