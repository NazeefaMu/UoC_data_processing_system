Railway accumulates record income through fines on errant commuters

The Department of Railways has earned a record income (Rs. 8,705,242) as fines from errant commuters through inspections and raids on trains during the past six months.
The Superintendent of the Department said 6,129 fraudulent commuters were fined and they were caught through raids on trains travelled in three regional railway zones of Colombo, Nawalapitiya and Anuradhapura.
Travelling in class 1 and 2 compartments with class 3 tickets, travelling without tickets and passing destinations specified in tickets were offences they have committed.
The fine was increased to Rs. 2,500 to mitigate the number of offenders, the sources said. Railway authorities have intensified their inspections and raids to curtail the number of fraudulent commuters.
