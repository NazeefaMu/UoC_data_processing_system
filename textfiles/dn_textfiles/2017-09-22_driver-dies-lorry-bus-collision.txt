Driver dies in lorry-bus collision

A driver of a batta lorry died on the spot when his vehicle collided with a bus at Millawa on the Kurunegala-Kandy road yesterday.
He was identified as Supun Bandara, 30, a vegetable trader in Kotmale. His father who was seated in the front seat had escaped with minor injuries.
The lorry was transporting a stock of avocado fruits from Kotmale to Chilaw when the accident occurred. Neighbours had to make a great struggle to take out the lorry driver’s body from the crumpled lorry. The bus was transporting a group of over 25 people to Matale who had attended a wedding in Colombo.
A few passengers in the bus suffered minor injuries.
Kurunegala Police are investigating.
