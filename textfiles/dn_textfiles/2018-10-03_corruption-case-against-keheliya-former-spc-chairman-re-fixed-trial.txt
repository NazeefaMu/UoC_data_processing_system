Corruption case against Keheliya, former SPC Chairman re-fixed for trial

The corruption case filed against former Minister Keheliya Rambukwella and former State Printing Corporation (SPC) Chairman Bandara Heenkenda was yesterday re-fixed for trial by the Colombo Chief Magistrate’s Court.
This is for allegedly causing an unlawful loss of Rs.230,984 to the government after paying the former Minister’s mobile phone bill by using SPC funds, while functioning as the Mass Media Minister in 2012.
The Bribery Commission alleged that the former Minister had induced the SPC Chairman to pay his mobile phone bill from March 15, 2012, to April 14, 2012, causing an unlawful loss to the government.
The Bribery Commission had named former SPC Chairman Jayampathi Bandara Heenkenda as an accused for aiding and abetting to commit the offence.
The Commission to Investigate Allegations of Bribery or Corruption Director General filed the case against the former Minister and former SPC Chairman under Section 70 of the Bribery Act on three counts.
The Magistrate fixed the trial for January 25.
