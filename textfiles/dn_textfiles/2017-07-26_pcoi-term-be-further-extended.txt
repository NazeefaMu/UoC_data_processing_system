PCOI term to be further Extended

The Presidential Commission of Inquiry investigating into the Treasury bond issue yesterday re-issued summons on former Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayake.
Treasury Bond Commission Secretary S.Udugamasooriya said the former Finance Minister is to appear before the Commission today.
Minister Karunanayake was summoned before the PCoI to give evidence yesterday (25), but his lawyer informed the Commission that his client is unable to come before the Commission due to official commitments including the Cabinet meeting. A heated argument ensued between Senior Additional Solicitor General Dappula de Livera and Minister Karunanayake’s lawyer Sandun Gamage on July 24 at the proceedings when Minister Karunanayake’s lawyer made this information available to the Commission.
The gazette extending the term of the Treasury Bond Commission for a further three more months was to be issued yesterday.
Udugamasooriya said such a request to extend the term was made but the Commission has not been officially informed of the extension.
