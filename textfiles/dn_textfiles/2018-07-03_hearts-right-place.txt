Hearts in the right place

Oscar Wilde has stated, “The smallest act of kindness is worth more than the grandest intention” Students of Lyceum International School, Nugegoda, conducted a series of projects under the theme “Random Acts of kindness” to commemorate the 25th Anniversary of the school. The students initiated various projects to raise funds for a worthy cause to help people in need.
“Random acts of kindness” enabled the students to interact with different individuals in society, whose needs were diverse. It inculcated the values such as sharing, helping and empathizing towards one another, which are vital towards developing a fully rounded personality.
The programme was initiated by the Head Master Kasun Dissanayake, teachers and students, with the blessings of the founder Moham Lal Grero, Coordinating Principal Kumari Grero and the Director Nikitha Grero. The Principal, Dulka Mendis also extended her support tremendously in making this project a success.
