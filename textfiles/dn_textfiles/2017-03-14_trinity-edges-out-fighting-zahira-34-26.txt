Trinity edges out fighting Zahira 34-26

Trinity College, Kandy was really lucky to beat the fighting Zahira College Maradna outfit by 34 points (6 tries, 2 conversions ) to 26 ( 4 tries, 3 conversions) in their Singer ‘A’ Division inter schools league first round rugby match played yesterday at Zahira grounds in Maradana. The winners led 24-12 at half time.
Zahira dished out a superb brand of rugby and gave a torrid time to Trinity throughout the game, but two tries by winger Seneviratne and scrum half Anuk Boyagoda just before the close of play cost them the match in the end. Trinity College scored four tries through centre Dilukshan Dange (two), fly half Lashen Wijesuriy and hooker Hasiru Weliwatte one try apiece with Wijesuriys converting two tries and Zahira closed down the gap with two brilliant tries by their fly half Sahid Sinhawansa (nephew of Hasn Sinhawansa of Isipathana & CH and FC fame) and speedy winger Yuzran Lanthra while Sinhawansa put over one conversion just before half time.
After the break Zahira scored through their captain Ashar Irfan who went through the Trinity defence to score and Sinhawansa made no mistake with the conversion to take the score to 24-19 in favour of the Kandy school.
Zahira College scored again this time a spectacular try through seasoned campaigner, fly half Sahid Sinhawansa which him self made the conversion to grab the lead 26-24. Trinity sealed the match when replacement winger Seneviratne and scrum half Anuk Boyagoda scored superb unconverted back to back tries which brought the final score to Trinity College 34 points to Zahira college 26.
