Chat with Chef Anura

Meet Chef Anura Uduwaraarachchi who is the Executive Sous Chef at Hilton Colombo. He has been serving with Hilton for the past 23 years and has won awards for his amazing culinary art and dishes.
T&C got together with him to know him a little bit more.
Demi H: Your full name and a bit about yourself.
Anura Uduwaraarachchi: My family originally is from Kandy. We moved to Colombo when my grandfather was just a boy. I studied at the Royal College Colombo and started the culinary journey from Inter-Continental as a trainee Chef. I’ve been in this profession since 1977 to date.
DH: Why are you a chef?AU: Because I’ve always wanted to be a one.
DH: What do you feel when you are cooking, creating and working in the kitchen?AU: It simply makes me happy
DH: Who is your biggest critic?AU: Myself
DH: How do you handle dishes that are rejected and sent back to the kitchen?
AU: First of all, I make it a point to personally speak to the guest and see what went wrong. In our industry we treat our guests as kings and queens. I attend to each and every one of them and re-prepare and present the dish to the guest by myself. We never say no.
DH: When at home… do you cook or do you let your partner take control?AU: I cook for my family very often. Sometimes I cook with my wife.
DH: If you were not a chef… what would you be today?AU: Nothing. I wouldn’t have it any other way.
DH: Of all the places you worked, what are your greatest memories of them?
AU: Back in 1982, I was working in hotel Meridian, Baghdad, while the Iran-Iraq war was going on, the city was Aerial bombed by Iranian terrorists. The hotel was a 24 storied building and was full house at the time of attack. Most of the guests and employees were foreigners.
We were forced to run towards the bunker they had built right under the base of the building for the safety of staff from frequent terrorist attacks.
I remember watching anti-missiles firing up to the sky from top of the hotel building through the restaurant window while everyone else was running for their lives. But that was not long before one of the Iraqi military officers grabbed me by my neck and forced me in to the bunker for safety.
Given below is a recipe which is a favourite of Chef Anura and very easy to make as well. So why don’t you give a go at this and let us know how it turned out.
