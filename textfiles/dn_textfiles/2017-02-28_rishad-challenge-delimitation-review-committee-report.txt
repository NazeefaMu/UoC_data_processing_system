Rishad to challenge Delimitation Review Committee report

The All Ceylon Makkal Congress (ACMC) led by Minister Rishad Bathiudeen is to go before court challenging the report of the Delimitation Review Committee.
ACMC General Secretary S Subairdeen told the Daily News yesterday that a court case would be filed no sooner the Gazette notification on the Delimitation Report comes out.
He said the main reason for this move is because they feel that the representation of the Muslim population would be badly affected in the way the new boundaries of wards are demarcated. “We are losing our legitimate representation in the local authorities. As of the new delimitation boundaries they have drawn, the Muslim majority areas may become diluted. Therefore, we have consulted our lawyers to file a case in this regard,” he said.
He pointed out that the total number of LG members would rise to 11,000 as of the new electoral system, adding that this would lead to unnecessary expenses which are not in proportion with our economic system.
He stated that the ACMC would go before court first and that other small and minority parties are expected to follow suit because they too have the same grievances.
Local Government and Provincial Councils Minister Faiszer Musthapha on February 17 handed over the report of the Delimitation Review Committee to be gazetted.
