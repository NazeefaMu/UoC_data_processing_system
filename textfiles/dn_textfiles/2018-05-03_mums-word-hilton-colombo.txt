Mums The Word at the Hilton Colombo

Of all the gifts that life has to offer, a mother’s gift is the purest of all! “Reserve the second Sunday in May to shower mom with the love and attention she deserves. After all the meals she has prepared over the years, treat her to a taste of the Graze Kitchen to celebrate her day. Impress her with a royal brunch fit for a queen on May 13.
Let her enjoy cakes or gift her a Mother’s Day Hamper from Café Kai, be serenaded by the De Lanerolle Brothers, receive a gift pouch with luxurious GAIA products and indulge in the extravagant brunch buffet prepared by Executive Chef Kazi and his team. Who is better than a team of international chefs to pamper her with the sweet and savory dishes of some fabulous choices including, but not limited to the international salad bar but a variety of cheese together with accompaniments, ocean fresh green lip mussels, clams, tiger prawns, oysters, crabsand salmon, a juice cart with fresh juices, honey comb in bottles to traditional Japanese favs which include salmon nigiri, chicken katsu roll and more.
From the rotisserie, Australian meats and accompaniments, fresh pizzas like lobster and arugula pizza from the hot stone section, a la minute preps at the pasta corner; namely saffron gnocchi with lamb and sundried tomato. From the lava grill comes the salmon and prawn skewer, marinated pork chops and the like.
