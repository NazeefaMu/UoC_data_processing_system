Sapungaskanda refinery renovation will commence soon: Chandima

Sapugaskanda refinery renovation will commence after receiving the committee report this month on the matter, Petroleum Resources Development Minister Chandima Weerakkody said yesterday. He was speaking at a press conference in the Petroleum Resources Development Ministry auditorium.
He said a committee was set up earlier to look into the renovation. Its report was submitted before the Parliament Economic Committee and then another committee was appointed. A member of this committee had proposed new ideas and the final report would be presented in January. He said the renovations would commence on its recommendations.
The minister said the fuel tanks in Trincomalee were handed over to India in 2002. There is no intention to sell them now as the JVP alleges. “This is our country and we are taking decisions on behalf of our country,” he said
