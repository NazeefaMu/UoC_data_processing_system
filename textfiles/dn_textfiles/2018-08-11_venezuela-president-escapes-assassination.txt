Venezuela: President escapes assassination

It was 5.41 p.m. on August 4. Venezuelan president Nicolás Maduro was addressing a parade at Bolivar Avenue in Caracas to mark the 81st anniversary of the Bolivarian National Guard.
Two drones identified as DJM600s carrying C4 explosives were approaching the presidential rostrum of the parade. One exploded in the air, probably shot down by the president’s security detail, while the other veered off and crashed into a nearby residential building.
It was clearly an attempt to assassinate President Maduro. Though the President was unharmed seven members of the National Guard were injured. Venezuela’s Interior Minister, Nestor Reverol claimed the government thwarted the attack using “special techniques and [radio] signal inhibitors”, which “disoriented” the drone that detonated closest to the presidential stand.
There was widespread condemnation of the attack throughout the world. UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres has condemned the attack.
“The secretary-general is concerned about the latest developments in Venezuela and rejects any act of violence,” said Farhan Haq, Guterres’ deputy spokesman. Nicaragua, Cuba, Uruguay, Bolivia, El Salvador, various Caribbean island nations, and the regional ALBA bloc repudiated the attack. Russia, Iran, Turkey, Syria, Vietnam and India were among the other nations that condemned it.
The US government did not condemn the attack and instead said that “there was no US government involvement”. It also put forward a ludicrous claim that the attack could have been engineered by the Venezuelan government itself!
The Venezuelan president accused outgoing Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos of being behind the attempt on his life.
According to the Venezuelan Attorney General 19 persons were involved in the attack. President Maduro announced he would use the country’s international accords to request the extradition of at least five people, including a former colonel, who has been implicated in the “terror attack” and is currently living in the United States or Colombia.
Three persons - Argenis Valero, Juan Carlos Monasterios and José Rivas detainees detained a few hours after the attack, were produced in court and charged with treason and murder. The prosecutor alleged financiers of the crime are located abroad and steps are already being taken to capture and extradite him.
Among them he named retired colonel of the Bolivarian National Guard Oswaldo Garcia, who reside in Colombia, as well as Osman Delgado, who lives in the United States as two of the financiers.
President Maduro has also alleged the former President of Venezuela’s National Assembly Julio Borges “who lives in a mansion in Bogota protected by the outgoing government of Colombia,” was involved in the attack.
Meanwhile, a former police chief Salvatore Lychees, who is also in Bogota, also claimed to have played a role in the attack and warned of others in a televised interview. “We had an objective, and at the moment we were not able to materialize it 100 percent… The armed struggle will continue”.
Pakistan’s foreign policy challenges
The new government in Pakistan is faced with considerable challenges in its foreign policy. Relations between Pakistan and the United States had deteriorated fast, especially after President Trump came to power. Indo-Pakistan relations too had deteriorated and the Kashmir problem has aggravated. During the election campaign Imran Khan was critical of the relations with China.
However, indications are that the new government will tread cautiously in the foreign policy front. Prime Minister Imran Khan stated that the first priority is to consolidate the good relations with China, which is crucial for Pakistan’s prosperity. He also softened his stance on India and the United States. Imran Khan correctly stated the premise of the relationship between the India and Pakistan should not be conflict but poverty alleviation for one of the largest poverty-stricken populations in the world. He called for dialogue instead of confrontation.
With regard to US-Pakistan relations he said that they should be balanced and based on mutual respect. It is also significant that Pakistan is distancing itself from the earlier pro-US stand and is trying to be more independent in its foreign policy. Relations with Russia seem to be improving. Last Tuesday the two countries signed an agreement to train Pakistan defense officials in Russia which could result in changed perceptions on world developments. Voice of America commented that the Russians are keen to step in and fill the gap which the United States has created after halting security-related aid to Pakistan. The inaugural meeting of Russia-Pakistan Joint Military Consultative Committee met in Rawalpindi recently where the talks were headed by Defence Secretary Zamirul Hassan Shah and visiting Russian Deputy Defence Minister Col Gen Alexander Fomin. Pakistan and Russia had signed a defense cooperation agreement in 2014.
