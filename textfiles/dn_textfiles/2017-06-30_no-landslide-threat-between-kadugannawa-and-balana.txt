No landslide threat between Kadugannawa and Balana

There is no imminent landslide threat to the rocky hill overlooking the ladder bend and Lion Jaw tunnel between Kadugannawa and Balana railway stations, the National Building Research Organisation said.
Organisation’s Management Unit Director R.M.S. Bandara said an investigation conducted by the organisation proved the terrain was firm and steady and does not pose an immediate landslide threat.
The investigation followed complaints made by residents about a possible danger to the up country railway line from rock boulders hanging overhead. Bandara said the rocky surface might collapse with time due to geological and hydrographic factors and the human land utilisation patten, he said.
