Promoting healthy living

Amãna Takaful PLC (ATL) the flag bearer of the Takaful way of insurance in Sri Lanka, came forward to extend much needed advice and direction to their trusted clientele and the general public through their latest CSR initiative.
ATL in association with the Millenium walkers Club of Malambe hosted ‘Nirogee Diviyaka Asiriya’, a health clinic that sought to decipher much needed medical and nutritional advice to the public. This health clinic was attended by many health and fitness enthusiasts in and around Malambe and witnessed a large gathering.
The attendees were briefed on two ground breaking medical policies introduced by ATL. The first of those policies explained and greatly embraced by the public was the ‘Suvasiri Health Insurance Policy’ which gives coverage of Rs 100,000 for a nominal installment of just Rs 2, 222 a month. Renowned as a revolutionary health insurance policy this entails the policy holders the benefits of claiming Rs 4,000 a day as room/ward charges for up to maximum of 10 days, hospitalisation fees up to 30,000 rupees as admission, administrative, medical, surgical and consultancy fees, up to Rs 7,500 as theatre charges, up to Rs 25,000 as surgeons fees, Rs 5,000 as anaesthetic charges, Rs 5,000 as specialist consultancy charges, maximum of up to Rs 15,000 rupees (for hospital stays exceeding 3 days) and a minimum of 5,000 rupees for specialist services such as scanning, x rays, laboratory charges….etc and rupees 500 a day for hospitalisation at a government hospital up to a maximum of 21 days and Rs 2,000 to purchase medicine from an outside/private pharmacy in case it is required during hospitalisation at a government hospital.
“KruthaGuna” a pioneering hospitalisation policy meaning “gratitude” especially designed for Individuals over 55 years by ATL to fulfill a noble responsibility that has that has thus far not been provided for by the insurance industry. This scheme entails the policy holders for an array of benefits including the coverage of hospitalisation charges, ambulance charges, and residential nursing care. Furthermore, this insurance scheme uniquely entails the policy holder the coverage for any pre-existing health conditions that may need continuous treatment from the second year of subscription to the policy onwards.
