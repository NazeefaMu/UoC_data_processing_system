‘Eyes’ speak!

The idea is present in his mind. He sees through is eyes, he has the ‘eyes’, and his fingers remember their strength. They do the rest. Daily News features Chandrasena Perera a photographer who has won international awards and also displays skills at painting.
“I began my career as a newspaperman, starting out as a freelance photojournalist in 1965, at the Independent Newspaper. After it closed down I became a proof reader at the Government Printing Department. I have received numerous accolades for my photography at an international level. You need a good eye for photography. Even though technology has advanced rapidly, it is important to master the basics of photography and all related areas. At school a lot of Art Photography is taught. Wedding photography is altogether a new area,” pointed out Perera.
However Perera the all- round photographer has even ventured out in to the challenging area of Wedding Photography.
“My photography is the result of careful contemplation, hard work and dedication. Now what I do is teaching photography to school children and sharing my knowledge with them. I am also involved in clubs. I am also hired by teams to take photos of visits. So I have built my business and I have a demand,” said Perera.
Now a pensioner, he has not abandoned the vocation which brought him such rich dividends.
“Before entering the field of photography I had this interest from my school days. I had a box camera and I took pictures. I found this very interesting. I had a great interest in Arts which was not for an interest of money. I had this love. This is the reason for where I am now. I do not have a particular theme that I shoot under. I take all types of photos. I dabble in all aspects in the field. I even do wildlife. And I have received awards internationally for my work in the spectrum,” explained Perera
So this is currently an ongoing process for Perera. This is why he teaches and this is why he still plays the game.
He is not stingy about knowledge and shares it openly and fully. He teaches some leading schools in Colombo.
“Now I am 75 years old and still fit as a horse! When I look at the photography industry in Sri Lanka, the quality is low. Today, because of the digital camera and technology, the techniques of handling the camera manually is not what it was. In our times we had to learn so many things and apply it into our vocation. That was how we produced high quality photos. When we learnt, we had to know about light and shading and so many different aspects,” added Perera.
Art is subjective and perceived differently. It is subtle.
“I have received many awards/medals from France. I also have an aptitude for painting. I am a self- taught man, but to qualify as a photographer and to get a certificate, I attended the Art Society. I finally got my diploma and I have also received certificates internationally. Technology has transformed the industry. It is relatively easy now. I do portrait, glamor and wildlife,” informed Perera.
Perera sends his work to international exhibitions. He does this online. Work is not only sent to France but to India and other countries as well. From the exhibitions Perera’s work receives many awards. The work is sent under various categories.
“There is a judging panel that deliberates and awards the medals. When it comes to presenting my works, I have already done four exhibitions and the fifth is coming up. This I am planning to hold at the Lionel Wendt. I am satisfied with the life I have led. I do not create problems for myself in life. I am patient and can endure. I am not shaken by cut throat competition. I have around 100 medals. I teach at Sirimavo, Devi Balika, Gotami and Janadhipathi Balika. I want to raise a new generation of photographers.
Perera’s hand is not hidden. His knowledge and experiences are freely shared. He visits schools daily, on all five days of the week working directly with the photographic societies with the teacher in charge being present.
“The children are really enthusiastic and show a keenness. Technology has taken up a lot of the work done by a photographer in this day and age, tasks we needed to perform taking great pains. But with this comes a certain responsibility and a need for ethical conduct. Students have to be brought up to the correct standard, so that when they leave school they will carry with them the professionalism of a photographer. When it comes to interschool exhibitions my students receive many awards,” stated Perera.
A man who has lived life to the fullest, Perera has everything to look forward to. He is a global traveler visiting countries with the intention of immersing himself in photography.
“I have gone to so many countries like Dubai, Vietnam and Myanmar and taking part in Workshops in India, going there eight times for eight photography workshops. There I learnt much. I went to Taiwan with some friends of mine for the festival and also to take pictures. Some of these excursions were invites. I still savor the memories,” summed up Perera.
