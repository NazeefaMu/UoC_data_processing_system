Call to enshrine socioeconomic rights in Constitution

The Bar Association of Sri Lanka (BASL) and the National Endowment for Democracy held the second of a series of public discussions on the inclusion of socioeconomic rights in the new constitution yesterday at the BASL.
“These meetings aim to educate the public on pressing constitutional matters by encouraging active discussion among legal experts, parliamentarians and citizens,” said Geoffrey Alagaratnam PC, President of the BASL and yesterday’s moderator.
Four panelists each spoke for 15 minutes before engaging in a debate and fielding questions from the audience.
The first speaker, Professor Camena Guneratne, Dean of the Faculty of Humanities and Social Sciences at the Open University of Sri Lanka, said the time is ripe to include socioeconomic rights in the Constitution.
“Civil and political issues are linked to socioeconomic ones. All are entitled to socioeconomic rights,” she said.
Dr. Dinesha Samararatne, Senior Lecturer, Department of Public and International Law, Faculty of Law, at the University of Colombo, seconded Guneratne, saying that guaranteeing socioeconomic rights would strengthen welfare and reverse the trend of worsening quality of life for Sri Lankans.
She was against the idea that empowering the court to enforce socioeconomic rights was a bad thing: “The judiciary is not outside of the democratic process. We have a competent and independent judiciary that has the expertise to deal with socioeconomic rights cases.
Rajendra Theagarajah, Deputy of Chairman of Cargills Bank and Attorney Niran Anketell were against including socioeconomic rights in the constitution, as both pointed out that there is no evidence that guaranteeing these rights constitutionally helps the poor and vulnerable.
“There is evidence, in fact, that socioeconomic rights protections help the middle and upper classes who have access to good lawyers, rather than the poor,” said Anketell.
He highlighted the problems of making these rights justiceable and raising the people’s expectations.
“It is dangerous when the court becomes a forum for distributional politics,” Anketell said.
