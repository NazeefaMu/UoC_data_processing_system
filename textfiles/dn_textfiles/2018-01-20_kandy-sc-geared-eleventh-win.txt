KANDY SPORTS ROUND UP :
Kandy SC geared for eleventh win

Kandy Sports Club will host fourth placed CH & FC in the eleventh second round league rugby game at Nittawela today. Both coaches Kandy SC’s Sean Wijesinghe and CH & FC’s Tavita Tulagaese who is affectionately called “Laga”, a former Kandy SC player and coach, have still not announced their squads. In the first round game Kandy SC gave a good display to beat CH. Kandy SC head into this clash with an unbeaten record so far.
They have won all the ten matches they played and CH & FC in their ten games have won five, drawn one and lost four. Since Laga took over CH coaching he has worked hard at getting the best out of his players, and their president Shammi Silva too has given them a lot of support.
The Maitland Crescent team have shown signs of improvement under the guidance of head coach Laga, but their attacking play has not been at its best as they have only scored five wins this season. In the last outing they beat Air Force 28-12, and Kandy SC beat CR & FC 50-15. So, today can CH & FC go toe-to-toe with the KSC in a skill-based contest? Kandy must go for tries from every opportunity and keep belief with that plan even under pressure.
Their back line looks to be stronger than their pack. They have built this side around a desire to play open rugby and have moved the game on as a result. CH can be at full strength, this would be the best chance to present a good game of rugby but winning is not possible with a team like Kandy. In this game they will come with a backline that could be the best in terms of threat, pace and power. CH in the last few games have come out with a competitive pack and have tried to make contests a dogfight by scrapping and spoiling, but their back line was limited and lifeless.

Antonians in thrilling sixth win
St Anthony’s College’s beat Sri Jayawardenapura MV to record their sixth win of the inter school cricket season. After a couple of seasons, Antonian’s are back on track at cricket. A big hand should go to their coach Sampath Perera for guiding them to do well. This is a school which has been a major force in school cricket at one time, but in the last few years they failed to keep up to those traditions and were demoted to Division II a couple of years back. Last season they had a good chance of getting promoted but the losses to St. Benedict's College and Vidyarhta College deprived them of promotion. They have started the season with a loss to St. Sebastian's College Katuneriya and later won six games.

Sportsmen Mithrananda Weerasinghe makes his last journey

He was cremated at the Mahaiyawa cemetery. A product of Dharmaraja College where he excelled in cricket in the early 1970’s, he was a fine all-rounder. After leaving school he joined as the Playground Instructor of Kandy Municipal Council and gave a big hand for sports. From here he joined the Prisons and played cricket and football.
He served in the Prisons Department for thirty years, and through their welfare society gave a big fillip for sports. After retirement he worked for the Water Board. Kandy has lost a loyal sportsman and promoter and the game he loved cricket will be very much the poorer by his passing. He leaves his wife Nelum and only son Arjuna.
