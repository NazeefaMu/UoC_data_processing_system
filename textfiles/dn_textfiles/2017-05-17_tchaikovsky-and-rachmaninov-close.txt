Tchaikovsky and Rachmaninov up close

As the 20th century loomed, the number of composers who saw the day, were the brilliant masters destined to mesmerize the world of classical music. Each had his own forte not surpassing the other and played in a world of his own, some turbulent and others gentle and smooth but all enchanting. We had a choice: a great choice to select our own favourites from Russia across to Europe and the choice was unlimited. There was Dvorak who wrote his NEW WORLD SYMPHONY, a favourite of mine as well as all the ballet scores of Tchaikovsky. There was also the lilting FOUR SEASONS by Vivaldi, Beethovan's Symphony No. 3 (EROICA) Mozart's SINFONIA CONCERTANTE (K364), and all THE REQUIEMS by the masters. The list is endless but with the lesser known Johann Pachelbel's CANON in D remaining my favourite for ever.
Last week two great masters were brought together by The Symphony Orchestra of Sri Lanka with the Earle de Fonseka Trust and boarded at the Lionel Wendt Theatre with two of our great players on strings along with Russian pianist, Maxim Puryzhinsky who is in Sri Lanka for the second.
Sadly, I missed this opportunity to hear two of my favourite composers being played, especially by violinist, Ananda Dabere and cellist, Dushyanthi Perera, being confined to bed with the dreadful flu. I was looking forward to hear Puryzhinsky on the keyboard.
I never miss any concert at which Ananda Dabere play whom I consider the best in the country with a tinge of magic filled with enduring harmonic flicks and flounces that reminds me a bit of Frank Peter Zimmermann of the London Philharmonic Orchestra as first violin whom I have seen on many occasions because like him Dabere plays with an extra profundity that seem to reach heavens on strings but I believe that Dabere remain our own home-grown genius who need not and must not be compared with another even as great Zimmermann.
Being Russian, Puryzhinsky opted playing the glorious Tchaikovsky and the eccentric Rachmaninov whose works would simply have melted on strings on equal terms as on the keyboard. Among some scores wore:
Tchaikovsky - The Seasons Opus 37 A, No. 5
- Strait Nights
- Meditation in D Minor
PETER TCHAIKOVSKY
He needs no introduction both in ballet and music for students, teachers and conductors around the world. This great genius learned the piano late into childhood because he was to become a lawyer. In his late twenties, he realized where his talents were when his father packed him off to boarding school along with brother, Modest.
He had a good education and a French governess. He failed to secure a post at the Ministry of Justice and declared not suitable enough that made his father realize Tchaikovsky's interest lay only in music and a piano was secured for the purpose of a late start. In the mean time his mother had died. Thereafter, he followed his teacher, Nicholas Zaremha to the St. Petersburg Conservatory and two years later, invited to the teach harmony at the Moscow Conservatory for which, he lived with Nicholas Rubinstein.
He started to emerge as a talented composer but was held back by signs of neurosis he developed from the age of six by listening to music. By the time he wrote Symphony no. 01 and Winter Daydreams, his nervous disorder surfaced, especially a numbness in hand and feet. Even colitis, hypochondria and hallucinations seared him.
He was of opinion that his head would fall off if he conducted an orchestra. Like brother Modest, he was feeling the sense of homosexuality that bothered him and to overcome, a pretty 28 years old music student called Antonina Milyukova who had been threatening him with suicide, if he did not marry her, married her.
It was a total disaster and five days later, he was not in a position to scotch the current rumaurs because Antonina started blackmailing him. Later, she was confined to an insane asylum where she died in 1917. However, his guardian angel, Nadexhda von Meck continued to support him. After an illustrious and brilliant career, he died of a highly contagious disease.
He was unconscious at the time of his death and kept calling out the name of Mme von Meck. She died two months later in Germany.
SERGIE RACHMANINOV
If Tchaikosky was a neuro, Rachmaninov was an eccentric and both given to the healing power of philosophy. Infact, he consulted a psychologist for hyphnosis therapy.
His aristocratic and expensive father was a pianist from a land-owning community but like others sold the assets to upkeep the family. That did not deter him from his onward journey as pianist, conductor, composer all rolled into one with much success.
It Tchaikovsky failed in his marriage for success, Rachmaninov steadied his life by his marriage to cousin, Natalie Satina who was to play an important part in his life and success that led him to be a professional pianist in America where he arrived at the late stage of his life and became a citizen. A few weeks later, he died of cancer and buried in Kensico Cemetery, New York.
Very few pianists equaled his playing that rose from the bottom of his heart. His innovative art with boundless joy came off an eccentric soul. Never at ease, Rachmaninov sailed into each and every heart inspite of the criticism leveled against his playing and composing during his lifetime.
