National Cyber Security Operations Centre: Singapore Technologies Electronics wins contract to consult

 
Singapore Technologies Electronics has won a contract with Sri Lanka's Information and Communication Technology Agency (ICTA) to provide consultancy services for the implementation of the country's first National Cyber Security Operations Centre (SOC), the Straits Times reported.
In addition to the design and implementation strategy for the National SOC, ST Electronics will provide training and conduct awareness programmes to strengthen the cyber readiness of Sri Lanka's digital team and its other key partners, the Singapore firm said on Wednesday (April 19).
"This marks a major milestone for our cyber security global business as we continue to expand our footprint overseas," said company president Ravinder Singh.
"Having built four major Cyber SOCs for customers including government and commercial organisations, we are well-equipped with the deep domain knowledge and extensive experience to protect critical information infrastructures.
ICTA began operations to begin Sri Lanka’s first National Securities Operation Centre in the wake of a comment by Air Force Commander Air Vice Marshal Gagan Bulathsinhala in 2015, who said wars would be fought on the cyber front in the future.
