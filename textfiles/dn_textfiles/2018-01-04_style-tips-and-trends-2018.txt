Style, tips and trends for 2018

Fashion makes the world go round and round. The fashion meter changes by the day and social media applications like Instagram and Snapchat makes everyone look flawless. Here is a glimpse at what’s in and what’s out in 2018.
Eyes
Glittery eyes: It’s no surprise that we’re feeling the glitter moment that’s happening right now. While it is prime time to turn up the sparkle factor, this trend will stay long after holiday party season has come and gone. Whether it’s a wash of a subtle shimmery shadow across lids, a chunkier glitter embellishment in the inner corners, or sparkly eyeliner along the top or lower lash line, you no longer need a special occasion to break out the bling.
Lips
Red hot lips: Red lipstick isn't a trend, but the way people are wearing it certainly is. Rather than pairing the shade with cat-eyes or bold eye makeup, makeup artists are taking a less-is-more approach. At the Spring 2018 shows for Temperley London, Haider Ackermann, Blumarine, and Max Mara, models walked the runway in bright crimson lipstick and barely-there makeup.
Peach lips: We hagve spotted peach tones all over this season. Use the shade to complement any eye look, or pair it with matching peach blush and shadow for a monochromatic effect.
Cupid's bow: Makeup artists have been applying touches of carefully-placed highlighter to Cupid's bows to fake fuller, juicier lips for decades. Lately, though, they have taken the tried-a true hack and opting for in-your-face metallic and glitter finishes that don't just highlight the area, but make it the focal point of a look.
Glass lips: The beauty world's obsession with all things dewy has turned to lips. You have likely seen images floating around of juicy, heavily-glossed lips that toe the line between a healthy pucker.
Skin
The difference between matte and dewy skin has to do with the finish that the skin leaves; the amount of shine and radiance. Matte skin is void of any excess oil. It has a more velvety finish that pulls light inward, often with a powdery texture. Dewy skin has an almost moist appearance. It has natural oils that reflect light and create a radiance.
Matte skin is good for people with excessively oily skin or acne/breakouts. People with this concern usually want to minimize the oil and prefer a matte formula that won’t add more moisture.
Dewy skin is my favorite. It is young, fresh, and vibrant. It works well on any age including mature skin as it moisturizes and reflects light, softening any fine lines or imperfections. Dewy skin gives the appearance of health and an active life.
Hair trends for women
Fake bangs: Not into the idea of fully committing to bangs? It's easy to make fake ones for the night just by flipping over a section of hair from the back of your head, and putting the rest up in a top knot.
Long, long locks: Kim Kardashian channeled her inner Cher by rocking long, luscious hair - ad it works! You will probably need help from extensions to get the full length like Kim, but if you decide to grow your hair out instead, be sure to trim it every few months to keep your strands healthy.
Tow-toned blonde: Stars like Selena Gomez are going into the new year with newly-blonde locks. But if you want to do the same, that doesn't have to mean completely abandoning your original hue. If you're changing your colour, keep the roots dark underneath and have your stylist blend out the top to a bright blonde or silvery grey.
Barely-there waves: No need to spend hours on your hair. Barely-there waves are in, and they are super easy to master. Just grab your straightener and create a few subtle waves here and there, and you're good to go.
High and tight pony: It is easy to beat humidity when you sport a high pony. Slick your hair back, secure with a hair tie and some spray, and go about your day looking totally chic and cool. The heat doesn't even stand a chance.
Super blunt bobs: The return of strong architecture is back with super blunt lines in bobs. Women who became comfortable going from long hair to mid-length hair have now built up enough courage to go shorter.

Hair trends for men
There are so many new hair trends for guys this year including fresh looks, updated classics and even some old favorites. What is old is new again and vice versa. There are new men's hairstyles that reinvent older styles, like the crop that is an update of the Caesar cut. And classic styles with updates like the pomp fade. These cool men's hairstyles range from fades to tapers, buzz cuts to man buns.
Haircuts with shaved sides are cool, clean cut and easy to wear. Whether it's an undercut or fade, shaved sides emphasize hair on top and make hair seem thicker. Fade haircuts taper down from short to shorter or down to the skin. These shaved sides haircuts have mid to high fades. Undercuts are similar to high fades because they shave hair from the top of the temples down but it is all one length.
Nails
Darker hues: A darker hue like cobalt blue or burgundy is perfect for the colder months. It is sophisticated and flatters all nail shapes and lengths.
Minimalism: Less is more. Play with simple embellishments, nail tape, and negative space for subtle art that's fashion forward.
Glitz and glamour: There is no time like New Years to go all out with disco ball nails, If disco ball nails are a bit too much, you can always audible for a sparkly shimmer in a classic silver.
Bridal hair and make up trends
Bold up dos, plaits, waves and defined eyes were big on the catwalks at New York fashion week. While last season's trends aren't going anywhere, this season saw a new take on some of our favourites. Capes are still going strong, but this season they've been upgraded from capelet to full-on princess cape.
Off-the-shoulder dresses are still everywhere and ultraflattering, but designers put a new spin on sleeves for them. Ladylike mid-length dresses have us all seeing visions of Audrey Hepburn in ‘Funny Face’.
From princess-inspired capes to detachable sleeves, tea-length ladylike frocks, and even shorts, these are the wedding-dress trends of 2018.
