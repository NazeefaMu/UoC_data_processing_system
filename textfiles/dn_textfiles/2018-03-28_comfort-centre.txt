A comfort centre.....

Despite the Trade, Commerce and Tourism Department of the Central Province providing a comfort centre at the Pattipola station on the upcountry line, a tourist finds solace in a baggage trolley to catch forty winks until the arrival of the train. The up country railway is a route taken by many tourists specially those visiting Kandy, Nuwara Eliya, Ella and the Horton Plains. Train travellers complain that despite paying high charges for train bookings and tickets, the service and creature comforts provided is abysmal.
