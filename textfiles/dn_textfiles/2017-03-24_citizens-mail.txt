Citizens' Mail

No lottery grand prize winners in Sri Lanka?
Sri Lanka which has a population of a little over 22 million people have over 4 lotteries per week with an average of three draws each day by the NLB and Development Lottery.
In contrast, Thailand which has a population of a little over 60 million people have only two lotteries per month and there is always a winner of the grand prize. In Sri Lanka there are no grand prize winners as the winning ticket has not even been printed.
It’s time the authorities look into this and see that the total number of tickets per draw that are printed.
There is only a limited number of tickets with a particular alphabetical letter which is in the region of 20,000. When different numbers are given the numbers range from 10 to over 70, so getting a combination of 4 numbers within the 60 numbers is very remote.
