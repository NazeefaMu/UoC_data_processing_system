FCID, AG noticed to appear in Court over Wimal’s revision petition

The OIC of the FCID and the Attorney General were yesterday noticed to appear before Court on February 13 by the Colombo High Court over a bail revision application filed by National Freedom Front leader MP Wimal Weerawansa.
Weerawansa arrested and remanded for allegedly misusing 40 vehicles belonging to the State Engineering Corporation (SEC) while functioning as the Housing, Construction and Engineering Services Minister incurring a loss of Rs. 91 million to the government, had sought bail from the Colombo High Court through a bail revision application. When the matter came up before High Court Judge Wikum Kuluarachchi, President’s Counsel Gamini Marapana with counsel Navin Marapana appearing for Weerawansa complained Court that the prosecution has failed to present a proper certificate issued by an Assistant Superintendent of Police (ASP) in accordance with the Public Property Act.
This bail revision application is to be taken up for support on February 13. Through this revision application, Weerawansa sought an order against the Colombo Fort Magistrate’s Court refusal to grant bail.
The petitioner is seeking an order to release him on bail.
Weerawansa was arrested by the FCID on January 10 under Public Property Act charges and he was ordered to be further remanded till February 7 by Colombo Fort Magistrate Lanka Jayaratne.
The FCID conducting investigations into the alleged misuse of state vehicles informed Court that Weerawansa had given his written and verbal approval to the commission to commit these offences while functioning as the Housing, Construction and Engineering Services Minister.
