Coconut cultivation

The Coconut Cultivation Board (CCB) has taken measures to promote coconut cultivation in the Matara District.
Under this initiative, 18,000 coconut saplings have already been distributed to cultivators in the Mulatiyana Divisional Secretariat area. Coconut fertilizer has also been issued to farmers at concessionary rates by the CCB.
