SLIM inaugurates Strategic Brand Management Diploma for 2018

A Diploma in Strategic Brand Management (DSBM) is the foremost strategic branding qualification in Sri Lanka introduced by the Sri Lanka Institute of Marketing (SLIM), the national body for marketing.
DSBM students are bestowed with the knowledge on theories of Branding and how to apply that knowledge on the Brands that they work on. A unique and integral part of the SLIM DSBM program is that students have to carry out a practical brand unveiling session as their integrated assignment.
The 12 month part time DSBM program is ideal for young executives interested in branding, trainee brand managers and professionals/marketers in the corporate sector as well as entrepreneurs ho want to develop brands to the nation.
SLIM had the first inauguration of the Diploma in Strategic Brand Management (DSBM) for 2018 at SLIM Home, which was attended by a cross section of prospective DSBM students and personnel in the corporate sector.
SLIM President Pradeep Edward, the CEO of Lanka Hospital Diagnostics, said that DSBM endows necessary skills in marketers to build valuable brands by utilising internationally proven, innovative branding strategies and best practices.“Branding not only helps position products and services but also individuals. One specialty of SLIM DSBM is that the students are able to experience practical aspects of learning.”
SLIM Vice President Education, Suranjith Swaris shared a special message with the prospective students. In his speech, he demonstrated the power of branding and its manipulative effect on consumers. “Branding is a vital tool which marketers can use to surpass competitors and have an edge over rival products. Brands such as Fedex, Coca Cola and Nike have made unique reputations.
They have become top-of-the-mind brands, while earning reputation and recognition. As the National body for Marketing we want you to develop many brands to the Mother Nation”.
Lanka Grills Proprietor Remo Issac Rajamoney who is a SLIM-DSBM past student attending the inaugural session made an insightful presentation on how the DSBM programme helped him to excel as an entrepreneur and start his own brand, Lanka Grills.
SLIM CEO and Executive Director Sanath Senanayake expressed, “We enhanced the practical value and real world application of DSBM by identifying industry needs to ensure that we produce marketers who could cater to the demands of modern marketing and branding.”
