New IT Solution  from Smart Metro  to Finagle Lanka

Smart Metro, known for its solutions in IT for local businesses for nearly a decade, recently introduced their latest IT product for Finagle Lanka, a leading bakery products manufacturer.
The new system, Smart Sales Force Automation, excludes the delay found between the placement of the orders and approach to the complex about the mother company in general. This also caters to save all the data required by the business, paving the way for effective and accurate data acquisition. This would amplify the efficiency rate of the company.
Smart Metro is in the vanguard for sales force automation for local businesses.
For tea factories, they introduced NFC and ATM facility related electronic cards with Sony Corporation in operation with Commercial Bank.
The electronic ticketing machines for buses, CCTV cameras and NFC cards are some of their other products.
All the details are securely stored in central data storage by using encryption methods and authorized individuals of the companies can retrieve the information.
Smart Metro minimized the delay in transportation of tea leaves by improving the rapport between technical communication and the purchase of raw tea leaves for the small tea estates owners, which improved productivity.
Smart Metro has also introduced security systems and many other technical devices.
