Mihintale restoration work to be completed before Vesak

Mihintale Maha Seya restoration is to be completed before the Vesak festival. Agriculture Minister Duminda Dissanayake visited the sacred Mihintale Raja Maha V|iharaya recently and instructed the relevant parties to accelerate the work. Mihintale Raja Maha Vihara Chief Incumbent Ven. Walawahangunawewa Dhammarathana Nayaka Thera told the Minister that there was a soil erosion underneath the Chaithya and hence the restoration work should be completed soon.
The rehabilitation work commenced in January 2016 targeting to finish it within one year. The Nayaka Thera said the work was dragging on although the Army Engineering personnel contribute their level best to complete the work.
Delays in supplying building materials and funds resulted in the present situation, the Thera said.
