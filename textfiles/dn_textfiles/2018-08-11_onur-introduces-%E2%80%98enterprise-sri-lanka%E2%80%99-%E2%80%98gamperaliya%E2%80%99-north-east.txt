ONUR introduces ‘Enterprise Sri Lanka’, ‘Gamperaliya’ in North, East

The Office of National Unity and Reconciliation (ONUR) introduced the ‘Enterprise Sri Lanka’ loan scheme and Gampraliya Project in the Northern Province at stakeholder meetings held at the District Secretariats in Jaffna and Vavuniya, recently.
The progress review of the last three years’ work carried out by the ONUR in the districts was presented by the respective District Secretaries. Commitments were made towards additional initiatives for the upcoming year.
They will focus on projects related to income generation, sanitation, rural infrastructure development, psycho-social support programmes and projects for women-headed households.
The attendees included Northern Province Chief Minister C. V. Wigneswaran, Deputy Minister Kader Masthan, Parliamentarians Mavai Senadhirajah, S. Adaikkalanathan others.
The Northern Provincial Council appreciated the work carried out by the ONUR while providing constructive feedback towards better implementation of projects by further delegating the work to various institutions.
ONUR Chairperson former President Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga said, “It’s important to empower communities and individuals to be able to improve their lives and bring normalcy. The loans introduced by the government and the work we do through the ONUR are for the whole of Sri Lanka and each activity contributes towards building long lasting peace in its own way.”
The ONUR, in its role as a catalyst in the work related to reconciliation, has completed nearly 600 projects worth Rs. 1,250 million in the North and East Provinces, to uplift basic infrastructure facilities such as rural roads, community water supply and sanitation, access to electricity, education, health, irrigation and livelihood development in the last two years.
The ‘Enterprise Sri Lanka’ loan schemes to encourage entrepreneurship, would enable the provision of credit facilities for the resumption of economic activities in agriculture, livestock, fisheries, micro and small enterprises, trade and other self-employment projects in war-effected areas.
The newly introduced rapid rural infrastructure investment scheme ‘Gamperaliya’ will invest directly to uplift the living standards of local communities.
