Former envoy organises pinkamas at Kelaniya viharaya

Former Sri Lankan Ambassador to Russia and Presidential Advisor on International Relations Dr. Saman Weerasinghe organised a series of religious activities at Kelaniya Raja Maha Viharaya and a scholarship programme for children, recently.
A hundred students of the Sri Kalyani Dhamma School were given gift vouchers to purchase books with funds from Dr. Saman Weerasinghe Foundation.
An alms giving for the Maha Sanga and a Bodhi Pooja were also held, presided by Ruwanweli Maha Seya Chief Incumbent Ven. Pallegama Hemaratana Nayaka Thera and Kelaniya Raja Maha Viharaya Chief Incumbent Ven. Prof. Kollupitiye Mahinda Sangharakkitha Thera.
The religious activities were organised in remembrance of Dr. Weerasinghe’s parents and sister. Ven. Sangharakkitha Thera praised the diplomatic services of Dr. Weerasinghe, recalling that he was able to organise a meeting between President Maithripala Sirisena and Russian President Vladimir Putin, and getting the embargo on Sri Lankan tea leaves lifted within a short period.
