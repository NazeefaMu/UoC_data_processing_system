Separate hospital for Thalassemia patients

Sri Lanka will be able to build the world’s first separate hospital for Thalassemia patients, Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayake said.
The minister said the government expects to provide all facilities to eradicate Thalassemia from Sri Lanka.
The minister was speaking at a ceremony organised by the Sri Lanka Thalassemia Circle at the Apostolic Nunciature Embassy of Holy See at Bauddhaloka Mawatha, Colombo 7 yesterday. Minister Karunanayake said that Budget 2017 has allocated Rs.500 million for Thalassemia patients. He said more funds could be allocated if necessary.
The minister said the tax revenue collected by the previous regime was used for their personal luxury at that time, but, such tax money is used today for the benefit of the common man.
