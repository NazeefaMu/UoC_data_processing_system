GMOA appreciates PM’s stance

Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe is honestly trying to legalise the ‘Minimum Standards of Medical Education while Health Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne is trying his best to stop it, Government Medical Officers’ Association (GMOA) Secretary Dr. Haritha Aluthge said.
Addressing a press conference at the GMOA Head Quarters in Colombo yesterday, he said that the Prime Minister has appointed MP Tilak Marapana to oversea the Attorney General’s Department. The GMOA appreciates this action very much.
The Attorney General’s Department had informed the Health Ministry that the minimum standards of medical education cannot be gazetted. The letter had sent by the same official from the department who mislead the judiciary during Court of Appeal case.
“We request the Prime Minister to call for an immediate meeting of all relevant parties to discuss the minimum standards of medical education. According to the Health Minister’s recent speeches, the standards should be gazetted on or before August 14,” he said.
“But, it will only be a dream because he does everything possible to prevent gazetting minimum standards in order to prevent exposing the low standard of SAITM and bring in another five SITM type fraudulent institutions, Dr. Aluthge said.
GMOA Assistant Secretary Dr. Navin De Zoysa said that the current Health Minister prevented the gazette containing minimum standards of medical education passed in Parliament as an Opposition MP and the relevant Hanzard records will be released to the public soon. If the minimum standards of medical education are there, no one including the Health Minister cannot permit low quality medical collages to operate. The low quality of Dr. Neville Fernando Hospital has already been revealed.
