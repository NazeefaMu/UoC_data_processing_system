Psychiatrists to be appointed to all districts

(Health Minister Rajitha Senaratne shakes hands with Prof. Martin Seligman during the conference)
Arrangements will be made soon to appoint 25 psychiatrists to all 25 districts in the country, Health Minister Rajitha Senaratne said.
Addressing the inauguration of the ICAP Sri Lanka 2017 conference at Colombo Hilton Residence today he said that all psychiatrists should get together to provide this service to the entire country.
Some mental sicknesses cannot be cured either using medications or counselling, he said. 
Minister Senaratne said that many Sri Lankans suffered mental trauma due to the 30 years long war and the tsunami and therefore it is very important to pay attention towards improving mental health of the people.
This international conference will continue till August 27th on the theme of `Enhancing the well-being of individuals to improve the quality of life at home, work and society'.
