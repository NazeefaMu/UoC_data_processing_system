The Chief Financial Officer of Global Logistics and Transportation B.H.J.Sinnaiah summoned to the Treasury Bond Commission testified regarding a loan facility taken by his company to purchase a penthouse on behalf of former Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayake.
Evidence was led on a previous day regarding a penthouse of 4000 squarefeet rented by the former Perpetual Treasuries CEO Arjun Aloysius on behalf of Minister Karunanayake’s family, spending Rs.10 million as the lease payment.
The former owner of the said apartment, Muthukudaarachchige Vinodini testified before the PCoI on July 24,2017. According to the evidence given by her, Karunanayakes purchased the said penthouse in the latter part of 2016 through a company named Global Logistics and Transportation Company.
According to evidence led at the Commission yesterday, the Global Logistics and Transportation Company (GLTC) director board includes Chairman T.V. Lakshmikanthan, Mela Karunanayake, Onella Karunanayake and Lakshmi Shankar.
According to Sinnaiah,70% of the company shares is owned by OSM Holdings represented by the two Karunanayakes and the 30% of it is owned by Hampton Group, which is a foreign company represented by the two Lakshmi's who live in Great Britain. Minister Ravi Karunanayake, who was a director of the said company, has stepped down from his post in January 2015 following the appointment as Finance Minister.
Sinnaiah said he received instructions in July 2016 from the two local directors of the GLTC to seek a loan facility to purchase the said penthouse.The two directors are Mela Karunanayake and Onella Karunanayake, the wife and the daughter of Minister Ravi Karunanayake.
Sinnaiah also said the GLTC applied for a loan facility from Seylan Bank in the latter part of 2016 to purchase the said penthouse at Monarch residencies in Colpetty.
Following the instructions, Sinnaiah has sent an email to a Seylan Bank Senior Manager requesting a loan facility of Rs. 150 million to be paid in 15 installments. Additional Solicitor General Yasantha Kodagoda read out the email sent by GLTC. According to the email, the GLTC has told Seylan Bank that the penthouse was to be rented out and the repayment of the loan will exclusively be done with the rental income. In previous evidence it was revealed that the said penthouse was purchased for Rs.165 million.
Commissioner Justice P.S. Jayawardena asked Sinnaiah on what purpose the GLTC purchased the penthouse. Sinnaiah said according to the two local directors, the company was to buy the penthouse for several purposes including to be used when the Chairman and his family or foreign clients of the company visit Sri Lanka.
Sinnaiah said the two Karunanayakes told him that when the above said visitors are not in the country, the penthouse will be given on short term rents.
Commissioner Justice Jayawardena asked if Sinnaiah was aware that the Karunanayake family was occupying the penthouse when the process to purchase the space was initiated. The witness answered in the affirmative. Justice Jayawardena then asked Sinnaiah if any GLTC foreign visitors occupied the purchased apartment. Sinnaiah said when such foreign visitors came they rented out hotel rooms and not the purchased penthouse.
Following this reply, ASG Kodagoda queried whether GLTC mislead Seylan Bank from where the GLTC acquired the loan, stating that the apartment rental money will be used to pay the loan installments.
Even though the witness refused as such, he did not give an explanatory answer to the question.
Eevidence led before the Commission revealed that the loan facility acquired to purchase the Penthouse was paid back using money belonging to GLTC Chairman T.V. Lakshmikanthan.
According to the evidence Lakshmikanthan’s money, of which the origin is undisclosed, was kept in the GLTC’s money safe since February 2016. According to Sinnaiah, GLTC Chairman Lakshmikanthan has visited Sri Lanka twice in February 2016 and February 2017.At both instances, Lakshmikanthan has placed Rs 70 million and Rs 75 million of his personal money in the GLTC money safe.
Justice Jayawardena asked him if the money came in dollars or rupees to which Sinnaiah said he is not aware of the currency.
ASG Kodagoda asked if Sinnaiah issued a receipt after receiving the money.Sinnaiah said he did not, since the money is his Chairman’s personal money.Kodagoda said he is shocked by the revelation that a company keeps Rs 70 million in cash, in their money safe. He questioned Sinnaiah as to how big the GLTC’s money safe is. Sinnaiah said it is a medium sized safe.
Sinnaiah said even while he was testifying before the PCoI, there is an amount of Rs 50 million in cash in the GLTC’s money safe.
ASG Kodagoda observed that there could be a possible instance of money laundering relating to this process of dumping millions of cash into a company safe and went on to say that the GLTC’s money safe seems to be a “Perpetual Treasury Box”. Perpetual Treasuries Limited lawyer Nihal Fernando PC stood up to say the reference to ‘perpetual’ was unnecessary to which ASG Kodagoda swiftly replied that “it is just a Friday afternoon.”
The Commission also observed that there were no documents to prove the inflow and the outflow of the said money safe. ASG pointed out without even “a scrap of paper” of prove, Sinnaiah is unable to support the claim that Lakshmikanthan has placed large sums of money in GLTC’s money safe. Kodagoda then went on to ask how exactly, Lakshmikanthan brought Rs 70 million worth cash to the company, while amusing those who were present at the hearing by demonstrating the action of a person carrying a heavy object.
Sinnaiah said his Chairman Lakshmikanthan came to the company on two occasions in February 2016 and February 2017 in a car. He said Lakshmikanthan carried the Rs 70 million and Rs 75 million on the said two occasions in two parcels. Sinnaiah said his Chairman told him to wait further instructions on the money after he kept the money in the safe.
Kodagoda asked If Sinnaiah knows as to how his Chairman earned such large sums of money, to which the witness said his Chairman is a businessman who operates from Britain and owns several businesses.Asked how old Lakshmikanthan is, Sinnaiah said his Chairman is around 70 years.
Answering to ASG Kodagoda as to what followed the purchasing of the Penthouse,Sinnaiah explained how the GLTC paid the installments of the loan taken from Seylan Bank.
“The first installment was due on October 2016. The company did not have sufficient funds to pay the installment.So I sought Miss Onella Karunanayake’s instructions. She told me that she would talk with the Chairman. Later on she got back to me and said to use Chairman’s money kept in the safe to pay the installment,” Sinnaiah said.
Sinnaiah said eight installments of the said loan were paid in the same fashion by using their Chairman’s money kept in the money-safe.
The PCoI is to sit again on Monday (31).
