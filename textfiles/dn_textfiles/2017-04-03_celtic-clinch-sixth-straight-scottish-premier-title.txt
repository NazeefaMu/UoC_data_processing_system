Celtic clinch sixth straight Scottish Premier title

Celtic have won a sixth consecutive Scottish Premiership title with eight games to spare after thrashing Hearts 5-0 at Tynecastle on Sunday. Brendan Rodgers’ side needed three points against fifth-placed Hearts to be confirmed as champions after Aberdeen hammered Dundee on Friday.
And they did so with a hat-trick from Scott Sinclair and goals from Stuart Armstrong and Patrick Roberts. Unbeaten Celtic have dropped just four points so far during their campaign.
“My job when I came in was to win it in the best way we possibly could,” said Rodgers. “We have had many outstanding performances but we have only just begun because there’s still an awful lot of development in this team. That’s the real exciting part.”
