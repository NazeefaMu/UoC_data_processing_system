‘Reinforced electric fences, the best solution to HEC’

The Tourism and Wildlife Ministry said that there was no better method to prevent the human-elephant conflict (HEC) other than the setting up of reinforced electric fences.
Digging trenches or setting up fences by growing plants such as bougainvillea, jute, lime and palmyrah had proven to be inefficient and expensive, ministry sources said.
Sixteen districts affected by the human-elephant conflict had been identified, they said, adding that the existing 4,349-kilometre-long electric fence would be extended by 2,500 kilometres to cover more areas under threat.
It would cost Rs.650,000 to Rs.700,000 to extend the fence by one kilometre, sources added.
It had also been reported that the lives of 245 wild elephants and 80 humans had been claimed by the human-elephant conflict so far, this year. Furthermore, 15 Wildlife officials had also died during attempts to drive wild elephants away from villages.
The Wildlife Conservation Department's statistics state that an average of 80 to 90 humans and 150 to 170 elephants lose their lives in the conflict every year.
Elephants usually invade villages and farms in search of food and water during droughts. However, elephants had been recently spotted invading villages in areas such as Thalawa, Korakahawewa, Kahatagasdigiliya, Wahalkada and Palagala, after the rainy season began as well.
Villagers in the affected areas said that they were not provided with enough crackers. They also added that Wildlife officials had not provided any assistance in the matter.
Dr. Prithiviraj Fernando, Chairman of the Centre for Conservation and Research, said studies show that the clearing of forest reserves for farming, or to set up institutions and factories, had aggravated the human-elephant conflict.
"Reinforced electric fences should be erected around villages and not around forest reserves. Furthermore, such fences are being tested in Hambantota, Trincomalee and Kurunegala, and the results have been promising," he added.
Dr. Fernando said that tracking collars would be put on wild elephants in order to locate them and study their movements. This would be useful to develop strategies to minimise the damage caused by the human-elephant conflict.
