'Regulations on tobacco products will not prohibit betel quid'

The Regulations on Prohibited Tobacco Products gazetted on Sep 1, 2016 had not been intended to have any effect on the traditional betel quid, Health Ministry sources said.
The main objective of the regulations was to provide the legal background for authorities to prohibit manufacturing, importing, selling or offering for sale of various items like Mawa, Babul, Beedi, Panpara, Gurkkha among others, which are manufactured with various toxins and harmful ingredients and protect schoolchildren and youths from the addictive substances.
Young generation in Sri Lanka tend to use Smokeless Tobacco (ST). Mawa, Babul and other similar imported ST products sold in the market at affordable rates. A recent survey reveals that schoolchildren are specifically targeted by the ST manufacturers and sellers, the sources said.
These products causes many major health problems, particularly oral cancer, cancer in the esophagus, and stomach and affect mental health. According to the health ministry reports, an increase in the number of oral cancer in the younger generation are evident in the last decade and it is directly attributable to smoking and using STs, the sources said.
