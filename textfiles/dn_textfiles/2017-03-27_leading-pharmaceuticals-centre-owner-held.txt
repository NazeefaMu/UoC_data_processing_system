Leading pharmaceuticals centre owner held

Officers from the National Drugs Regulatory Authority raided a leading pharmaceuticals distribution centre at Katugastota on March 25 and seized a stock of sample drugs intended for sale.
The raid followed information that drug samples being prepared for sale to customers were being transferred to other boxes after removing the ‘Not for Sale’ label. Drug authority sources said the sample drugs included those issued in respect of major diseases such as high blood pressure, asthma and catarrh.
Although the centre also had a stock of outdated drugs, they did not take any action regarding it since pharmacies had the right to stock outdated items to be returned to principal agents.
The owner of the pharmaceutical centre was released on a Rs. 100,000 bond and ordered to appear before the Kandy Magistrate on March 30.
The raid was conducted by a team led by Chief Food and Drugs Inspector Amith Perera.
