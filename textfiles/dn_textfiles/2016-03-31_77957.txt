Australia surges into fourth straight final

 
DELHI: Australia surged to their fourth straight final of the ICC Women's World T20 when they beat arch rivals England by five runs in a thrilling semi-final played at the Feroz Shah Kotla grounds here on Wednesday.
Chasing Australia's score of 132-7, England threw away a wonderful start of 67 given by openers Charlotte Edwards (31) and Tamsin Beaumont (32) to slump to 117-7 and eventually lose the contest by a narrow margin.
At one stage England needed 45 off 42 balls with nine wickets in hand, but from that point onwards Australia fought back to capture six wickets for 39 runs and put the pressure back on England which they were unable to absorb.
England's running between the wickets was sloppy and Australia's progression to the final was noteworthy.
"There are no secrets between us. Australia held their nerve and that was the difference," said England captain Charlotte Edwards. "We did not start well with the ball, but dragged it back. It was not meant to be for us today."
Australian captain Meg Lanning who took the Player of the Match award with a beautifully constructed half century off 50 balls said, "We were about par at the halfway. We stuck to our guns and if we did that, we knew we would be alright at the end."
Australia, the defending champions will meet the winner of the second semi-final between New Zealand and West Indies. The match is to be played at Mumbai on Thursday.
The final will take place at Eden Gardens on March 3.
Scores:
Australia Women 132-6 in 20 overs (Alyssa Healy 25, Elyse Villani 19, Meg Lanning 55, Natalie Sciver 2/22)
England Women 127-7 in 20 overs (Charlotte Edwards 31, Tamsin Beaumont 32, Sarah Taylor 21, Megan Schutt 2/15)
