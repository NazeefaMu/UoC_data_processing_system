UN’s Target 9.2 framework coming to Sri Lankan industries

UN’s specialized agency for industrial development is to usher and inclusive and sustainable industrialization framework to Sri Lanka.
The new initiative of United Nation’s Industrial Development Organisation (UNIDO) is part of a vast array of strategic interventions under the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) agreed globally in 2015.
“SDG 9 involves the three I’s -Infrastructure, Industrialization and Innovation,” said visiting New Delhi based UNIDO Regional Representative Rene Van Berkel, in Colombo recently.
UNIDO Representative Van Berkel was in discussion with Minister of Industry and Commerce Rishad Bathiudeen. Joining the meeting were Head of UNIDO focal point office in Sri Lanka Nawaz Rajabdeen and Senior Advisor to Minister Bathiudeen Himali Jinadasa.
“SDG 9 focuses on building resilient infrastructure, promoting inclusive and sustainable industrialization and fostering innovation,” said Van Berkel. “We aim to structure around inclusive and sustainable industrial development and investment, including SMEs. SDG9.2 (referred to as Target 9.2) promotes sustainable industrialization and raise industry’s share of employment and gross domestic product, and in in least developed countries, double industry share. SDG 9 can assist proposed industrial reforms as per the vision of the Government of Sri Lanka. We can work on new industrial parks and also on sub-sectors of the economy such as agri-business and farmer markets, farmer produce collection and storage, food processing and packaging, exports and stronger industry linkages to exports such as leather production.”
During his first visit to Sri Lanka in February 2015, UNIDO Director General Li Yong hinted of bigger plans for UNIDO’s Sri Lanka operations in his meeting with Minister Bathiudeen.
“Let me stress that it is time that Sri Lanka receives a fully-fledged UNIDO country programme. Sri Lanka is a very important member of UNIDO. The long history of national and international engagement by Sri Lanka is very commendable,” D.G. Yong said.
