Transforming Life on Stage

Cold Theatre 7 is a theatre group who believe that what they are doing is fun and meaningful. Led by Kevin Cruze they feel that theatre can unify all segments of society by being a second family to anyone who takes that leap of faith. Dramatic Moves features Cold Theatre 7 where you meet and see where it takes you.
“We started five years ago and initially there was a group of members from St. Joseph’s where I schooled who wanted me to go public and do a production. At that point I felt I did not have the time to go public. But these guys insisted on me doing it. So I accepted the responsibility of writing the script. So I decided on the script. The next question was- how are we going to market ourselves? That was when I was thinking of a name and I was thinking big! I thought to myself, 10 or 15 years down the line if we continue this, I want to look back and see how I started,” said Leader of Cold Theatre 7, Kevin Cruze.
Cruze recalled that the individuals who turned up for the first meeting, were some of the best actors during his schooling time. He refers to them as the ‘cream’ of the last decade. These were people he acted with and then directed later on. So the ‘cream’ of the last decade became ‘Cold’.
“What drives me is my self- belief and the fact that I have a good team backing me. As long as you have those two, you can achieve a lot. My first production was challenging in the sense it was my first production. The musical was challenging because it involved music, choreography and acting, so I was stepping into unknown territory. “12 angry men and 12 angry women” was challenging, because I was a young director, but I think I was able to project what I wanted. They were all professionals with their own agendas so getting them together at once was a challenge. When they were together, conveying what I wanted from them was a challenge. They were all professionals in their own right and they pulled off what I wanted them to pull off,” said Cruze.
Cruze confessed that he is more into the mystery and horror element. Although he has not done any horror plays he is into murder mysteries. “When it comes to thrillers I am at the edge of my seat, not knowing what is coming next! That is what I want my audience to experience. I also want to promote this love for theatre amongst the young people or the next generation,” pointed out Cruze.
Dramatist of Cold Theatre 7, Kavitha Gunasekera, is a drama teacher on the weekends. She has seen the transformative power of drama in the students she teaches, changing the way they respond to life in general.
“For me there was a point in my life, when I had to move from another country to Sri Lanka. I was born overseas, but because of the exposure I had in the performing arts back in school, it allowed me to come back and settle down in a way that I never thought would be possible. I want to give that back to the children I teach. In the auditions I never thought I would get the part in ‘Then There Were None’ or even continue in theatre. It was a risk that I took, and a risk Kevin took as well putting me in the cast. But thanks to his leadership and guidance, it has grown into something I never thought would be possible,” said Gunasekera.
‘12 Angry men and 12 Angry women’, is about a kid who apparently murdered his father. The cast is against the kid with the evidence pointing to him. Then the twelve jurors are put into a room to come up with a decision whether the boy is guilty or not. 11 say he is guilty but one says not guilty. So he wants to talk about the case. Soon doubt starts to creep in, and one by one people start changing their minds. Soon it swings back and forth. Soon all 12 finally say that the boy is not guilty.
“In 12 angry women, I played the role of Juror number 10. This was a role written for a male. It was also written in a particular period. So to be able to bring it into a modern day society and make it appealing to a Sri Lankan audience while honoring what the playwright wanted is something I enjoyed as well. The role of Juror 10 resonates with me for multiple reasons. Juror 10 is a racist and a bigot. Until the very end we don’t see that layer of personality coming out. It took a long time for me to really understand that character. I think it worked out in the end because the audience reception was such. I think it was timely for the country as well. Because the mentality Juror 10 projects is what we need to combat in society,” explained Gunasekera.

Gunasekera pointed out that juggling work, family and drama is difficult but manageable.
“I think you need to prioritize. It is about drawing a line. When work is done work is done. You then focus on the script and rehearsals. And when rehearsals are done, rehearsals are done. Then you focus on life at home and whatever you need to do in terms of responsibilities. The world maybe crashing down around you, but it is about focusing and balancing it out,” said Gunasekera.
Dramatist Amesh Fernando of Cold Theatre 7, said that the great thing about theatre is that you become part of a family consisting of people from different cultures and backgrounds.
“I first started drama just to get some experience and see what it was like. And I really connected with it. I enjoy Kevin’s style because he is more of a friend than a director.
His work ethic and style prompted me to join Cold Theatre 7. Drama is one place where you feel comfortable and connect with people. It is one place where you can just be yourself. Cold Theatre gives us that experience. Here everyone is treated equally,” said Fernando.
Fernando feels the script of 12 Angry Men is fantastic and he loved the play because he got to act with some amazing personalities.
“They were like the Godfathers of Sri Lankan theatre. To act with them was a real privilege and honor.
It was a fantastic experience. There was a lot of intensity when it came to rehearsals. It was one play that was challenging for me personally. Juror 3 was the toughest role I have ever done. 12 Angry men is the best play I have been a part of when it comes to Cold Theatre 7.
Juror 3 is a very intense character who is highly opinionated and always thinks he is in the right.

He is very open about his opinion. He also wants to prove that what he says is right above other peoples’ opinions or view point.
It was emotionally and physically draining doing the character. That is the only play out of all the plays we have done, when I was on stage for one and a half hours at a stretch without any interval or break. Acting for one and a half hours is something very tough to do,” explained Fernando.
Fernando has benefited a lot from theatre. He has got to know some incredible people from different backgrounds.
“That is something theatre has taught me. Embracing equality and how we must treat everyone around us as equals regardless of who they are and what backgrounds they come from,” said Fernando.
