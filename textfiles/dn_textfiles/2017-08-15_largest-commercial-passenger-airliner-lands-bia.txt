Largest commercial passenger airliner lands at BIA

An Emirates Airbus A380, the largest commercial passenger airliner in the world, landed for the first time at the Bandaranaike International Airport yesterday.
As the two-deck, four-engine plane taxied into the terminal, two fire engines sprayed the plane and its 550 passengers with water cannons.
The one-time flight demonstrated the airport’s new capability to handle large aircraft, representatives from Emirates said. The BIA completed an expansion to its runway in April.
A senior Emirates Vice President said the airline would begin flying A380s to Sri Lanka regularly if the market grows.
Emirates is the largest operator of A380s with 95 planes flying to 47 destinations.
Government officials, industry representatives and journalists toured the airplane after it landed, which has private showers, lounges, first class suites and a spa.
Yet even as Monday’s flight was meant to show off the BIA’s new capabilities, the airport is struggling to update its infrastructure.
At a press conference at the terminal, Transport and Civil Aviation Minister Nimal Siripala de Silva said plans for the expansion of the airport had stalled.
According to de Silva, the ministry had secured a loan from the Japanese government to fund the work, but subsequent bids came in at 47 percent higher than engineers had estimated.
“We have to sort out these issues,” he said.
