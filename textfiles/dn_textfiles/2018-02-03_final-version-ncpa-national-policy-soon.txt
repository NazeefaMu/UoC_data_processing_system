Final version of NCPA national policy soon

The National Child Protection Authority (NCPA) Act No. 50 of 1998 establishes the NCPA and also paves the way to formulating a National Policy on the preventing of Child Abuse and Protection and Treatment of Children who are victims of such abuse.
The NCPA sought views of the public in this regard and has now signed a Memorandum of Understanding with a Committee headed by its Founder Chairman Prof. Harendra De Silva.
It is expected that the final version will be presented for Cabinet approval by June 2018.
