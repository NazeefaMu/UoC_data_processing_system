Knightley  turns Sugar Plum Fairy

Disney has released a trailer for ‘The Nutcracker and The Four Realms’ starring Keira Knightley as the Sugar Plum Fairy, Morgan Freeman as Drosselmeyer and Dame Helen Mirren as the antagonist Mother Ginger.
It has all the majesty and grandeur you would expect from one of these Disney fantasy movies, which I imagine are budgeted using one of those novelty cash-firing guns.
The film follows Clara (Mackenzie Foy) who wants a key – a one-of-a-kind key that will unlock a box that holds a priceless gift. A golden thread, presented to her at godfather Drosselmeyer’s annual holiday party, leads her to the coveted key-which promptly disappears into a strange and mysterious parallel world. It’s there that Clara encounters a soldier named Phillip, a gang of mice and the regents who preside over three Realms: Land of Snowflakes, Land of Flowers and Land of Sweets. Clara and Phillip must brave the ominous Fourth Realm, home to the tyrant Mother Ginger, to retrieve Clara’s key and hopefully return harmony to the unstable world.
The film is out on November 2 and was directed by Lasse Hallström (Chocolat) and Joe Johnston (Jumanji)
