Does anybody care for Kandy’s Football ?

The Kandy Association Football League (KAFL) is 91 years old. The football lovers who served as officials and players say today football is not what it was in the past.
Although football has its root in Kandy for over 150 years, with the KAFL formed in 1925, and Kandy being one of the founder members of the Sri Lanka Football Federation (that time known as the Ceylon Football Association).
Although Kandy had one of the biggest leagues with over 40 teams in three groups, ‘A’, ‘B’ and ‘C’, even the people who are involved in Kandy football don't know when football was started in Kandy. Sadly, the 2015 event the one and only tournament organized as a knockout, and the final of that was played in 2016
The FFSL, made a big show in Kandy, saying Kandy will get a modern football stadium at Dangolla, through the FIFA , foundation stone was laid. Now nearly 18 months have lapsed and nothing has moved. The proposed venue is a pint sized ground and how they planned to put up a international stadium is inexplicable.. Football is in the doldrums over here in Kandy mainly due to the alleged mismanagement and controlling body not showing any interest. A look back into Kandy football reveals that football in Kandy had its origins in the mid 1920's during the 2nd world war when the British Units stationed in Kandy, with the onetime Commander in Chief of Allied Forces in South East Asia, Admiral Lord Louis Mountbatten had his headquarters in the hill capital played the game.
Firstly it was Kandy District Amateur Football League formed. It subsequently changed its name to Kandy Association Football League. It served football in Matale, Gampola, Nawalapitiya, Kurunagala and Kegalle, and as the years rolled by, these towns formed their own leagues. When Football in Colombo and elsewhere received a setback as far as Ceylonese exponents of the game were concerned, the game was more or less confined to cater for football enthusiasts among the permanent population as well as to the Services.
In the FFSL's premier league competition now on, sad to say no club from Kandy is participating. Holding office, for prestige is not what is required now, but they must come forward and do things. to promote the game. Today most of those holding office are only keen in coaching and refereeing for a handsome packet. If football in Kandy is to improve the Controlling Body must put the leagues in the correct path.
It was first class athletics at the inter school zonal meet which was worked off at the Bogambara stadium under the distinguished patronage of Chief Minister Sarath Ekanayake. In which Trinity College merged as the boys champions with 432 points and Mahamaya Girls College with 428 points were girls champions. Boys second place went to Dharmaraja College 288 points, third St. Anthony’s College with 187 points followed by St. Sylvester’s College 127 points, Vidyartha College 100 points and Sri Rahula 70 point.
In the girls second place was taken by Swarnamali BV 126 points, Girls High School third with 124 points and the rest in order Good Shepherd Convent 119 points, St. Anthomy’s Convent 177 and Pushpada Balika College 95. Antonain A.R.C. Weewardena was the best athlete of the event, he timed 48.6 seconds in the 400 meters D.T.A. de Silva of Swarnamali BV who clocked 25.2 seconds in the under 19 200 meters was the best athletic in the Girls., O.A. Dalpadado was the winner of the under 17 best athlete award and A. Almeida of Good Shepherd Convent won the under 15 girls award. A big hand should go to the Director of Education Central Province E.P.T.K. Ekanayake and his able staff for organizing a good meet.
Jayatilake takes over Kingswood rugby
D.U M Jayatilake has been called to coach his old school at rugby, a well-known physical trainer took the side before their traditional match against Wesley College for the Blaze trophy. This time they have lost all the matches they played and now the Kingswoodians are being demoted for the second round matches and will be playing in the Plate competition and their first game is against Prince of Wales. One of their old boys a top center three quarter Chamra Vithanage will continue as the trainer. So, much is expected from the new coach can he turn the table is the question
Very good performance is expected from Kandy schools in the second round of the inter school rugby season, please keep in mind no easy games, should play well, for that defence is great then superb attacking threat and execution!
This time in the first round matches of some failed to clinch a spot in the cup competition. Trinity College playing in the Division I segement “I A” were placed third, they only lost two games out of the five and now they are in the cup competition, and will play their first second round game against Science College.
It was nice to see St. Anthony’s College playing in the Division I Segment “I B” , did well in the last two games after losing the first three in a row , and now they are promoted to the top division after three long years. Will now play along with Trinity College in the Cup competition in the second round, their first games against St. Thomas College.
This time Kingswood College and Dharmaraja College both schools played in the Division I Segment –“1B” suffered heartbreaking losses and are now in the “Plate” competition. Many blame the style of play and poor squad selection. But it is time to have a look deeper than that in order to understand the root of the problem. Kingsdwood plays their first second round game against Prince of Wales and Dharmaraja will play Mahanama College.
St. Sylvester’s College who played in the Division I Segment – “1C” – are the only unbeaten team from Kandy, have won all the five games and now play St. Johns in the second round “Bowl” competition, and Vidyarhta played in the Division I Segment –“2A” lost only one game out of the 5 are also in “Bowl” and will play Lumibini in their first second round game., they fell short of 0 . 5 points, to be promoted to “Division I”
