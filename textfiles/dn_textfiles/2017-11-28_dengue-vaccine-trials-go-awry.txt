Dengue vaccine trials go awry

A total of 32 schoolchildren from ten countries in the world were infected with the dengue virus after receiving the dengue vaccine, which is now undergoing phase two clinical trials. Out of them, 29 are Sri Lankans, Health Services Director General Dr. J. M. W. Jayasundara Bandara said.
Addressing a press conference held at the Health Promotion Bureau in Colombo, yesterday, he said that the dengue vaccine is now undergoing clinical trials in ten countries including in Sri Lanka, and the vaccine had been given to around 20,000 schoolchildren. There are three centres in Sri Lanka connected to the ongoing clinical trial.
According to Dr. Bandara, for the first time in Sri Lankan history, the total number of dengue patients exceeded 100,000 in July and around 9,000 dengue patients were reported as the ‘midnight total.’ But the country was able to cut down the percentage of persons infected with dengue by 90 percent within five weeks, due to the huge contribution made by the mass media and the entire country.
Dr. Bandara pointed out that the health authorities expected a significant increase in the number of dengue patients due to the present rainy weather. But the number of dengue patients increased only slightly, due to the various programmes implemented countrywide with the assistance of the media in the recent past. Yesterday, around 1,400 dengue patients were reported from all parts of the country.
