SLC to mark Bangladesh’s 100th Test match

Sri Lanka Cricket plans to mark Bangladesh’s 100th Test match at the P Sara Oval today with a medal awarding ceremony which will be graced by the Bangladesh Cricket Board president Nazmul Hassan Papon.
“We would like to recognise the participating teams and give the team medals before the game for playing this match. This is a historic occasion for Bangladesh and we are happy that they are sharing it us with,” said SLC president Thilanga Sumathipala.
Commenting on the performance of the team he added that the Bangladesh team has come a long way in cricket. “Their participation has improved the economics of the game and Bangladesh now have a very mature, world-class cricketing structure. We are very proud and happy for Bangladesh.”
While in Galle during the first test he also remarked about Bangladesh acquiring Test status. “During 1998, I was the president of the Board of Control for Cricket in Sri Lanka. We voted for Bangladesh for Test status. I was also the president of Asian Cricket Council at the time. As an ACC initiative, we also sent four coaches for age-level cricket (U-13, 15, 17, 19). We have been helping each other since then and the team itself has come a long way.”
