Healthy skincare habits

We all want a glowing, healthy complexion, and now you don’t have to go to a spa or change everything in your routine to get it. Follow these three mantras meticulously to find yourself sporting fresh, clean and healthy skin every day.
SLEEP WELL
Beauty sleep is real. When you are sleep-deprived, with less than 7-8 hours of sleep a day, you will need a team of make-up artists to look gorgeous. Dark circles under the eyes are just one of the effects of lack of sleep – raccoon eyes, or what they call periorbital hyperpigmentation.
EAT WELL
You truly are what you eat. Eating right and exercising regularly goes a long way in maintaining a healthy complexion. Clean eating habits are reflected in the most beautiful way on your clear radiant skin. Eating brightly-coloured fruits, vegetables, and other good foods like blueberries and pomegranates are a great way to help your skin exude health from within. Check out Foods that feed your skin for some really good foods to incorporate into your diet.
DESTRESS
Keeping stress at bay is an important form of protection for the health of your skin. Chronic tension and physical stress causes surges of cortisol in the body, a hormone that can break down collagen and elastin, ultimately leading to wrinkles.
Stress can also worsen certain skin conditions, so find your zen zone and relax.
EXFOLIATE
Exfoliation is extra important because it helps shed the dead skin cells that build on the surface, and helps your skin glow. Exfoliation also helps increase the absorption of any topical moisturisers or products you are applying to your skin, so that you can really feel the benefit, and are able to show it off too!
