Next Campus student wins Alumnus Award at Birmingham City University graduation

Bringing prestige and recognition to both his institute and the country, Devinda Fernando, a student of NEXT Campus was the recent recipient of the alumnus award from the Birmingham City University.
Bagging this award at the 2017 graduation of the University held in UK, Devinda received the award from the Faculty of Computing, Engineering and the Built Environment as the top prize winner and the most outstanding student, achieving distinction for six subjects out of eight for the year 2017.
Contributing towards attaining this award was the distinction he received for his dissertation and the contribution of the study in the apparel industry that was focused on “the influence of the supply chain collaboration in the Sri Lankan textile and apparel industry.”
The scope of this accomplishment is compelling as Devinda had to compete against a large number of top students, many of them from graduate programs at well-established schools and Universities across many countries. With only a few top performing students being nominated this prize, Devinda’s award not only celebrates his visionary thought leadership but also recognizes him as a forward thinking leader in his industry.
Devinda currently holds the position of Assistant Manager - Corporate Strategy at one of the newest but most successful new organizations to enter the business arena in Sri Lanka, Hela Clothing.
Devinda paid tribute to his institute and said, “If I do anything well, anything innovative, and anything unique in my studies it is due to the extraordinary learning experience I had at NEXT Campus.
This award will be immensely beneficial to the Campus because as it ultimately is a recognition of the value that NEXT imparts to their students. As for myself, receiving this award means that there will be many new and exciting prospects that will open up for me.”
Congratulating him on his award, Director of NEXT Campus Kumudu Abeyawardane acknowledged “The Awards are all about honoring the success of top individuals whose achievements have been exceptional, innovative and denotes value to the industries they research and study about. We at NEXT celebrate this achievement along with him and congratulate him not only on his impressive success but also in the capacity as ‘an ambassador’ for our Campus in upholding the high standards we teach all our students, which we expect them to uphold in both their personal and professional life."
