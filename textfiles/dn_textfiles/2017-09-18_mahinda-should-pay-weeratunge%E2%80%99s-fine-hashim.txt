Mahinda should pay Weeratunge’s fine: Hashim

“It is former President Mahinda Rajapaksa and not the public who should pay the fine imposed on the ‘Sil Redi’ case,” UNP General Secretary and State Enterprises Development Minister Kabir Hashim said.
Minister Hashim was responding to questions raised by the media following a meeting held at Mawanella on September 15,
The Minister said the accused in the case should have been the former ruler rather than a public official because it was the former ruler who had issued the order to distribute ‘Sil Redi’.
If the former ruler had a genuine intention to distribute ‘Sil Redi’ as a meritorious act, he should have done that by with his personal funds.
He said the UNP always stood for justice. “It never tried to win votes by dangling the patriotism card.
There was a Sinhala Saying, ‘Patriotism is the last refuge of a rascal’. In the past patriotism was used as a tool to win elections,” the Minister said.
“The UNP always gives prominence and support to Buddhism. The Cultural Triangle Project which was established to upgrade Buddhist plans of worships was a brainchild of the UNP.
The UNP allocated the largest sum of money to rehabilitate Buddhist places of worships. Therefore, the party should not be held responsible for personal opinions expressed by some of its members,” the Minister said.
