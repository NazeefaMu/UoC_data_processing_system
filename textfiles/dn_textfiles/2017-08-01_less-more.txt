Less is more!

Being natural is not just a proclamation, it is also the closest anybody can get to themselves. Having said that, nude make-up is the finest technique in the industry to make an individual look completely natural and genuine. It not only enhances the features but makes them look real.
Ideal for women with sharp features, endorsing the look is only enhancing one’s natural beauty. Some people consider this look ‘bland or muted’, but if you’ve applied the right kind of products and on the right places, you can really look like a diva, that too effortlessly! The nude look involves using a few basic, neutral colours, such as rose, beige or peach, and their related shades. Here are a few tips you can use while trying to achieve this look:
Less is More: This is the first rule. You should not look caked-up while trying to look natural. Use foundation carefully and know when to stop!
Try to Look as Natural as Possible: Choose the shades that look natural on you. Lip colour should also look natural. Instead of matte lipstick, apply a little gloss on your lips directly.
The Magic Mascara: If you want, you can add false lashes to give a glamorous twist to your final look.
Blush: You can use blush, but make sure it compliments your skin tone. Do not opt for shades that look contrasting, and also keep a check on the amount of blush being used.
