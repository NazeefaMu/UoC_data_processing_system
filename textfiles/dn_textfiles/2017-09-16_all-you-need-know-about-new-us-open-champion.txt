All you need to know about new US Open champion

Sloane Stephens has become just the second unranked player to win the US Open since computer rankings began in November 1975. The first was Kim Clijsters from Belgium in 2009.
It was a first grand slam final for the 24-year-old American, who needed just 61 minutes to post a 6-3, 6-0 victory.
So, who is Sloane Stephens?
1. Stephens was born in Plantation, Florida and her athleticism is no surprise given her genes. She is the daughter of swimmer Sybil Smith and professional American football player John Stephens.
Her father left the family home when she was a toddler but they were reconciled many years later before he was killed in a car accident in 2009.
2. Stephens was introduced to tennis aged nine by her mother and stepfather, Sheldon Farrell, who died of cancer when she was 14.
She shared a hugely emotional hug with Smith immediately after the match and then paid tribute to her, saying: "I think parents don't get enough credit. When I was 11 years old, my mom took me to a tennis academy. One of the directors there told my mom that I'd be lucky if I was a Division II player and I got a scholarship."
3. Stephens first came close to winning a grand slam title four-and-a-half years ago in Australia. She beat Serena Williams in the quarter-finals before losing to Victoria Azarenka. Afterwards, Stephens went public about what she perceived as a snub by Williams, who had been described as her mentor.
"She's not said one word to me, not spoken to me, not said hi, not looked my way, not been in the same room with me since I played her in Australia," Stephens said. "They think she's so friendly and she's so this and she's so that - no, that's not reality." Stephens later apologised and they have since patched things up.
4. Prior to arriving in New York, the 24-year-old's 2017 earnings stood at $310,000 and her career earnings at $4.5 million, but that now stands at over $8m after she collected a $3.7m winners cheque. She also stands to make millions more in endorsement deals as a result of her triumph.
However, Stephens' wallet may be a little lighter now.
Keys suggested the newly-minted grand slam champion would be buying drinks to console her at a celebration party planned in New York later in the evening. –The Telegraph
