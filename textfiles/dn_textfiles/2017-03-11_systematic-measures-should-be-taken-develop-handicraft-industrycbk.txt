Systematic measures should be taken to develop handicraft industry:CBK

Former President Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga said yesterday, that if a systematic effort was made to develop the handicraft industry, craftsmen will not leave the filed seeking for other jobs.
The Former President was speaking at a ceremony organized to felicitate winners of Handicraft and Handloom exhibition conducted in 2016 by the Ministry of Road Development, Transport, Cooperative Development, Trade, Estate Infrastructure Development, Industries, Rural Development and Housing and Construction of Western Provincial Council held at Sambuddha Jayanathi Mandhiraya hall in Colombo yesterday.
She said the Ministry of Road Development, Transport, Cooperative Development, Trade, Estate Infrastructure Development, Industries, Rural Development and Housing and Construction of Western Provincial Councils render yeomen service to encourage and appreciate the talents of craftsmen and developing the handicraft and handloom industry in the Western Province. We must appreciate the service,” she said. I have a special interest in this filed. Therefore I never hesitate to buy handicraft and handloom products whenever I travel round the world. It was former Prime Minister Sirimavo Bandaranaike who gave state sponsorship to the handicraft industry for the first time in Sri Lanka. Her government established the Laksala to purchase the products of craftsmen, while creating market potentials for their products. The Laksala also provides loan facilities to craftsmen, she said. Crafts sector plays a vital role in the economic growth of the country. “This sector is instrumental in absorbing the talents and capabilities of the rural Sri Lanka into the export efforts of the country. This industry could emerge as a major foreign exchange earner to the country.
The handicraft industry has become a one of India's largest employers and a mainstay for the rural economy today. “We need a strategic plan to develop the sector. There should be a plan to help local craftsmen to be on par with international standards and be updated on the latest trends in the global hospitality and craft sectors,” she said.
