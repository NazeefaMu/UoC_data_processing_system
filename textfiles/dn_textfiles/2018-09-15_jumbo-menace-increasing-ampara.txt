Jumbo menace increasing in Ampara

Damage due to wild elephants is increasing in the villages in Ampara. Residents undergo great difficulties due to elephant attacks.
Elephants have found their way to the villages of Addalaichenai, Akkaraipattu, Nintavur, Karaitivu, Sammanthurai, Irakkamam, Alayadivembu, Thirukkovil and Pottuvil Divisional Secretariat areas in the Ampara district. Residents are in a state of fear.
They said elephants have attacked houses and shops, and damaged trees, coconut saplings, home gardens and devastated paddy lands and other cultivations.
As a result, the livelihoods of the people are affected. Parents complain that their children’s education is also affected due to the constant fear.
On Sunday, an elephant had entered Udanga 2nd village in the Sammanthurai DS division and damaged five houses, parapet walls and crops, and up-rooted other trees, Sammanthurai Divisional Secretary S. L. M. Haniffa said.
Digamadulla District Parliamentarian and Ampara District Development Coordinating Committee Co-Chairman M. I. M. Mansoor visited the affected area to look into the needs of affected families on Monday.
Villagers urge authorities to set up an electric fence to prevent wild elephants from entering the villages.
