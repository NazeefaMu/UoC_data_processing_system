[CITIZENS' Mail - (23-01-2017)]

Let us be proud of the GSP +
Whatever the Joint Opposition clamours citing numerous allegations against the government for gaining the GSP + facility again, right thinking people of this country should be proud and happy that the Government was able to get it back with its two years of successful tenure of office.
It is an apparent fact the GSP + concession enjoyed by Sri Lanka since 1990 had been withdrawn by the EU in 2010 due to the alleged violations of human rights, depriving the rights of the press, eliminating democracy and paving the country into dictatorial rule. Despite the withdrawal of the GSP, the country lost millions during the past six years. The export of the apparel to the European countries has been hampered and employment opportunities in the apparel sector to the youths was drastically reduced. The ordinary people suffered immensely due to the escalating unemployment rate in the country.
Even if the Government has to abide to certain legitimate conditions laid by the EU it is very much advisable and appropriate to gain the GSP + again to prosper the export market in overseas.
I foresee that there is nothing wrong in decentralizing powers to the provinces under the new proposed constitution because the people of our country are going to enjoy and get benefits from it. Further, repealing the terrorism act also can be considered because terrorism has already ended and another strong security legislation could be brought in, as an alternative, firmly strengthening the sovereignty and integrity of Sri Lanka.
The next is expediting the court cases handled by the FCID which could be done easily by establishing a separate legally empowered court.
