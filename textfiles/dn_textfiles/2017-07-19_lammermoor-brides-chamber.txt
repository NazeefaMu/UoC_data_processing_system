His novels have been romantic novels with Scottist historic events and Scottish characters. In many novels pretty heroines are involved and the problems of love and marriage are highlighted.
In Scott's ‘The Heart of Midlotian’ the herione Jeanie is a poor Scottish lower class unmarried girl,. She refuses to tell a lie to save her sister from a charge of infanticide. She goes to London to appear before the king to seek a pardon for her sister.

historic romance
However pretty women (Saxon Rowena) and Rebecca (a Jewess) as well as fighting knights, grim scenes of war, brutal lust and romantic love are expressed in a historic romance in England during the reign of Richard 1. Richard I. Richard I was in the Holy Land in 1194 engaged in the Third Crusade and on his return journey he was kept a captive in Austria. During this period his brother Prince John was ruling over England.
Richard I was in disguise as ‘Black Knight” taking part in the most gallantly contested tournaments of the age. Ivanhoe was a brave youth, the son of Cedric, one of Saxon nbility. Ivanhoe too has been with Richard I in the Holy Land and returned to England, working in disguise. Ivanhoe took part in the tournament at Ashby where he became the glorious winner.
He had to remove his helmet when he received the chaplet of honour from the Queen of the Tourney, the Lady Rowena. She recognised him with a faint shriek.
When he knelt down to kiss her hand he collapsed at her feet as he was bleeding because of severe injuries sustained during the combat. He was rushed into the house of a beautiful Jewess, Rebecca who nursed and treated him with great devotion and love. But there was a military ruffian of the Order of Knights Templers called Brain d
eBois-Guilbert who snatched off Rebecca to the castle of Torquilstone where he tried to insult and mollest her. But she vehimently protested his unlawful advances declaring that he was a Christian and she was a Jewess. But the ruffian just laughed over her protests. She prepared to fling herself out of the window into the moat.
However the ruffian could not rape her as he was called back immediately to defend the castle, as a group of outlaws from the greenwood led by Robin Hood and the Black Knight, saved Rebecca. But the powerful ruffian charged Rebecca as a witch and she was to be burnt alive. But in the end there was a dual fight between Ivanhoe and the ruffian.
‘The Bride of Lammermoor’ was a masterpiece of romantic fiction by Sir Walter Scott.
The story was set in Scotland. William Dalrymple, first Viscount of Stair, was one of Scotland's ablest lawyers. He was an important figure in the political reconciling of Scotland during the turbulent times. He was well recognized and respected as a noble statesman.
None the less, Lady Stair was heavily influenced by power, status and wealth. She was often referred to as a shrew or a witch.
Their pretty daughter was Jenet Dalrymple whe was in love with Lord Rutheford and was engaged to him.
However as rutherford was not rich and powerful the Stairs pressured Jenet to break up the engagement. The Stairs identified and selected David Lumbar, Lord of Baldoon as her ideal partner. She was forced to marry Baldoon against her wish and choice.
Wedding night screams
The marriage took place on August 12,1668 and the bridal party stayed in Stair's place for a few says before proceeding to Baldoon's residence.
During the wedding night screams were heard from the bridal chamber of the household. Jenet was found to be insane and Dumbar was lying in a pool of blood in his bed.
It was believed that Jenet stabbed Dunbar. But he did not die. Jenet never recovered from her insanity and she died shortly after this unfortunate incident.
Pathetic love
It was said that Dunbar declined to reveal the events that resulted in his injury.
Sir Walter Scott's romantic novel ‘The Bride of Lammamoor’ was based on the above historical mishap in Scotland. Scott changed the names and created events but retained the essential substance and the theme in his creation. The novel was an immediate success substance and the theme in his creation. The novel was an immediate success and became very popular. Critics rated it with Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet as a story of pathetic love. Scott created Lucy Ashton out of Jenet Dalrymple.
Scott's ‘The Bride of Lammermoor’, is said that its effect and popularity were surprising in Western Europe. The first dramatisation of it took place in London in 1819, less than two weeks after the publication of the novel. In 1827 a one act opera based on this novel was performed in Paris. In 1828, a drama was also performed in Paris. In 1829 Michele Carafa's opera'Le Nozze di Lammermoor’ was performed in Paris.
Marriage promise
The most famous Italian libereto ‘Lucia di Lammermoor’ by Gaetano Donizetti and Cammarano had it premiere in Naples in September 1835. In the Italian libreto there were shifts and changes in the plot and the characters. It was an opera in three acts with music by Gaetano Donizstti and libretoo by Salvatore Cammarano. The key characters were Lucia Ashton, sister of Lord Enrico, Edgardo, Lucia's lover, Lord Enrico Ashton, holder of Ravenswood castle and beother of Lucia, Lord Artufo Bucklaw-the enforced husband of Lucia and Alisa, the servant companion of Lucia. Two new characters have been introduced. They were Normanno, the chief huntsman and captain of the guard at Rawenwoods castle and Raimondo, the chaplain to the Ashtons. The two scenes in act one idicate a fruitless search for Lucia's lover and a secret meeting between Lucia and her lover (Edgardo).
They exchange rings and Edgardo leaves for France. In act two Normano and Enrico intercept and forge letters sent to Lucia by Edgardo. Lucia is misled saying that Edgardo has broken his marriage promise.
They have found her Lord Arturo Bucklow to be her husband, despite her protests and misgivings. Scene two in act two is the wedding ceremony when Edgardo burst in to blame, Lucia for breaking the marriage contract. He throws the exchanged ring and crushes it under his shoes. Edgardo was forcibly expelled from the ceremony. In act three often the first scene the encounter between Enrico and Engardo in a stormy night at the Tower is not performed. Scene two is Lucia's wedding night.
Raimando announces with horror to the wedding guets what he had seen – a scene of murder in the bridal chamber. Lucia appears before them quite pale and insane. Enrico rushes in and moves towards her. But Lucia faints into the arms of Alisa. In scene three in the burial ground of the Ravenswood Edgardo broods among the tombs. He realises that Lucia is dead. He stabs homself.
One of the most intriguing questions about Lucia di Lammermoore is: How did it really happen? Did half crazed Lucia murder her bride groomBucklaw on their wedding night? The assumption was that either that she has stabbed Dunbar (Aeturo) or that Rutherford (Edgardo) had somehow entered the bridal chamber and done the deed.
