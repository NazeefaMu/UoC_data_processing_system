Policemen warned for arrest sans evidence

Panadura Chief Magistrate Chaminda Liyanage warned Colombo Crime Division OIC Chief Inspector Neville de Silva and the Panadura South Police Headquarters Chief Inspector Thuara de Silva for arresting five suspects without any evidence.
The suspects were arrested over a case regarding petrol bombs being thrown at a shop and a mosque in the Panadura Police area in May. CCTV camera videos gave no evidence against the suspects, a government analyst said.
“It is unjustifiable for Police officers to act in a such a way. In the future, the Police should not get involved in such incidents and harass people. Let the Court grant justice on clear evidence,” the Chief Magistrate said. The case was postponed until October 30.
