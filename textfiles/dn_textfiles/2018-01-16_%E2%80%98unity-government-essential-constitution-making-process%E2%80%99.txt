‘Unity Government essential for constitution-making process’

The unity government should continue if the constitution-making process is to carry on, MP M. A. Sumanthiran said.
Addressing the media after a Thai Pongal ceremony which was held at the Opposition Leader’s Office in Colombo, yesterday, Sumanthiran said his party views that the government should move forward, despite the many issues that have risen recently.
“It does not mean that investigation on corruption should stall; they must carry on; but those issues must not cause the Unity Government to fall. Many progressive changes were made possible because of the national government of the two main parties,” he added.
The ceremony was held with the participation of Speaker Karu Jayasuriya and Opposition Leader R. Sampanthan.
