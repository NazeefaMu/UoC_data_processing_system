JO committee to decide on sitting independently in Parliament

The Joint Opposition (JO) yesterday decided to appoint a committee to arrive at final decision whether the Joint Opposition MPs will become independent in Parliament or not.
The JO has arrived at this decision at a meeting held under the patronage of former President Mahinda Rajapaksa at the latter’s official residence in Colombo.
Ratnapura District Parliamentarian Ranjith Soyza told the media before the commencement of the meeting that they would take a final decision whether their MPs would remain independent in Parliament soon
