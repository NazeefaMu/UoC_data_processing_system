Public warned of team promoting stem cell therapy for autism

The Sri Lanka College of Paediatricians (SLCP) has come to know of the presence of an overseas medical team which is unethically, unscientifically and unlawfully promoting stem cell therapy for Neuro Developmental Disorders, including Autism Spectrum Disorder, in Sri Lanka, during the first week of April, SLCP Secretary Dr. P. W. Prasad Chathuranga said in a statement.
According to Dr. Chathuranga, Autism Spectrum Disorder contains social communication deficiencies and interaction impairments together with repetitive and restricted behaviour patterns. Improvement of this condition is assessed by the progressive acquisition of skills.
Dr. Chathuranga said in his statement that the Sri Lanka College of Paediatricians wishes to inform the public that the only internationally accepted and scientifically proven therapy for autism is intensive intervention, based on communication and behavioural principles that will result in the improvement of the above clinical features.
“Stem cell therapy for these conditions is only used at an experimental level at research laboratories and is currently not recommended to be used for any of the Neuro-Developmental Disorders including Autism Spectrum Disorder. This is because positive outcomes from stem cell therapy have not been scientifically proven internationally. Also, it is not licensed to be used in Sri Lanka by the medicinal and health control authorities of Sri Lanka,” he said.
Therefore, the public is warned not to become prey to these parties who extol the virtues of unproven therapies and to those who are likely to exploit them and their families, he added.
