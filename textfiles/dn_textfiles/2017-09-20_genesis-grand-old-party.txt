Genesis of the Grand Old Party

The Sinhala Maha Sabha of SWRD Bandaranaike, Muslim League led by T B Jayah, and the Ceylon National Congress [CNC] a powerful political entity formed on the lines of India’s National Congress and led by Don Stephen Senanayake the Leader of the House in State Council, were the three political forces that combined to form United National Party. The Congress was a nationalist party formed by the members of Ceylon National Association and Ceylon Reform League on December 11, 1919, during the Colonial rule. At the end of 1942, DSS announced his displeasure with the new policies and new outlook of Congress. He resigned forthwith from the Executive committee, and within months he severed all relations with the Congress.
Senanayake, the man with foresight sought to retain the Tamils and Muslims also maintained under one flag. His assessment was based purely on policy matters: he opposed with its aim of achieving full freedom from the British Empire, preferring Dominion status; he disagreed with the proposals of Congress favouring Swabhasha instead of English; and opening doors of CNC for Communist members. These disagreements motivated him to form a political party free from religious and racial divisions. DS stated publicly his wish to retire from Congress insisting that,
‘…they ought to speak for the whole country rather than a party functioning for political power of a section…’ - Excerpt from letter of resignation dated 22/12/43
Six years later on December 29, 1949, JR Jayewardene moved a resolution at Kandy sessions of Congress, ‘…that the CNC … should now be dissolved’-- Daily News - 30/5/1949
By early 1946 DS was thinking of forming a new political movement that would stand for national harmony and of moderate views, an organisation acceptable to the minorities. Most of the Congress members and almost all in the State Council’s government associates accepted his invitation leading to the birth of UNP on 6th September 1946.
UNP’s Working Committee

The minutes of the first meeting does not carry a record on electing an Executive Council; only that the first meeting of the Executive Council was held at the same venue immediately followed by the inaugural session, The minutes says…,
“Meeting of EC was held on September 11, 1946, at Zahira College at 4.30 pm. Chaired by D S Senanayake, the house resolved to, as moved by Chairman..,
1. That the following members of the Exco be elected the Working Committee of the Party…. 20 members with U. A. Jayasundera as its Secretary.
2. That the ExCo do delegate to the WC all the powers vested in the EC under the Constitution.”
A WC meeting was held at Temple Trees on 8th August, 1949, at 9.15 pm., presided by DSS. Present: SWRD B. (Late arrival), Sir John K, T.B. Jayah…After the minutes Sir John wanted leave to bring a ‘matter of great urgency and importance’ before the meeting. He placed before the group a copy of the ‘Times of Ceylon’ of 8th (same day) instant and read there from the report of a speech supposed to have been made by SWRD at a meeting of the Singhala Maha Sabha and invited the committee to consider what action, if any, the committee should take as the speech, he insisted on was highly harmful to the interest of the Party—a resolution was adopted, to wit,
Following a general discussion in which the members present unanimously agreed on a resolution, to wit,
1. “that in the opinion…the speech…contained, (a) matters which were inaccurate in point of fact and, (b) opinion which bought [or were calculated to bring] the Party into ridicule and disrepute thereby undermining the confidence of the public in the Party….2. That this matter be brought up before the usual monthly meeting of WC to be held at TT on 15/8/49…to consider action…3. Secretary to write immediately to SWRD, inquiring the correctness of the report…get him to make a statement…discuss it at next meeting…”
Bandaranaike’s reply was tabled at monthly meeting on 15th August, where he spoke of newspaper report, ‘…inaccurate in some aspects’ in reporting and ‘…conveying an inaccurate impression’. However, the Committee decided to write to the newspaper highlighting every point raised in the letter. One of the points reported in the report attributed to Bandaranaike said,
“…no important question was ever placed before the EC of the Party; it had never met. At the end of the year the members had to play the part of ‘yes-man’—to which SWRD replied, “I said, Parties in Ceylon, both in the past and the present had displayed a tendency not sufficiently to consult party organisations when important questions arose, the UNP was falling into the same tendency and in its best interest this should be remedied.”
Policy clashes
The explanation was well received. SWRD did not dissolve Sinhala Maha Sabha. Two leaders, DSS and Bandaranaike were the custodians of traditional forces; their combined efforts led the UNP to victory at the General Elections held under Soulbury Constitution in 1947. However, personality and policy clashes between the top two in the new party aggravated. The first sign of a split emerged when Bandaranaike made some sarcastic remarks as mentioned before, and steadily developed into wider cracks resulting in a major break up in July 1951.
The SM Sabha, one of the three branches met in early June under SWRD where they resolute to present some suggestions in the form of resolutions to the UNP. The seven-point resolution was discarded in-toto by the UNP’s EC, saying, ‘they were not in order.’ The SMS met again re-structured the motion and fired it back to the UNP; it decided not to reassess. DSS was firm on its conclusion as it was not necessary to reconsider; “Past, it was a mistakenly entertained and not to follow the practice”.
A deputation led by J. C. Moonesinghe of SMS met the PM in a last effort to influence him; the two hour discussion was unsuccessful. The EC of S. M. Sabha met once more and decided to make an announcement through the press.
