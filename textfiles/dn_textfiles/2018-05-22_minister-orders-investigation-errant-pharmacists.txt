Minister orders investigation into errant pharmacists

Health Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne had ordered Health authorities to conduct an investigation in connection with certain pharmacists who had informed cancer patients that there had been no drugs available for their treatment, a Health Ministry spokesman said.
Minister Dr. Senaratne had ordered the investigation after a patient had made a complaint over the phone to him. Some pharmacists attached to the Maharagama Cancer Hospital had told cancer patients that there were no drugs to be issued, while there were adequate stocks of drugs. Later, the patients had been given the required drugs, after the hospital director had been informed about the incident.
