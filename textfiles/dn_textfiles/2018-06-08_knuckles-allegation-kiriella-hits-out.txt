Knuckles allegation: Kiriella hits out

Public Enterprise and Kandy Development Minister Lakshman Kiriella yesterday hit out at environmental groups for spreading false accusations against him and Minister Kabir Hashim with regard to land within the Knuckles Reserve being sold to the private sector. Addressing a media briefing together with officials of the ministry at the Department of Government Information, Kiriella stressed that only loss making state plantation lands owned by the Janatha Estate Development Board (JEDB), Sri Lanka State Plantation Corporation (SLSPC) and Elkaduwa Plantations were being looked at in order to further develop them under public-private partnerships and long term leases to private companies. The Minister had invited the main proponent of these allegations, Environment Conservation Trust Director Sajeewa Chamikara to the press conference but the latter failed to turn up to respond to the minister. Another notable absentee was the official from the Department of Forest Conservation who was also invited.
“No land within the Knuckles Reserve is sold or will be sold. These are plantation lands which have nothing to do with the Reserve,” the Minister said.
He further explained that when in 1992, 540,000 acres of plantation land was privatized and given to various plantation companies, the lands the companies did not want were retained by the government- these were the worst of the lot.
“Every year the Treasury has been allocating Rs.1,000-1,500 million to maintain these plantations and the Treasury had asked that we come up with a proposal to work with the private sector. It is then that we called for proposals for projects that can make use of these uncultivated sections of the plantations,”Minister Kiriella said. Advisor on the Plantation Sector Upali Wijesekara said it would cost Rs.7 million per hectare over seven years to replant and revive these plantations. “The government does not have the money for that”. The Minister said they had received 695 proposals and they accepted 254 out of them. These proposals were submitted to Cabinet and the lease of plantation land to these projects in principle were given Cabinet approval.
“These companies will now have to submit EIAs and get permission from the relevant government agencies before they proceed. Nothing has been built on the ground as of yet,” he said.
Ministry Secretary Ravindra Hewavitharana further explained that investment into these plantations were dire as it affected the estate workers who depended on them.
“We have 1693 cases of EPF/ETF/ gratuity (Rs 1800 million) not being paid to these workers for the last 20 years. We can’t give many of them work because there is nothing much to pluck in these estates”, he said.
At present, Rs.300 million in EPF/ETF/gratuity remains to be paid. At Hare Park estate, one of the most controversial and most unprofitable, is located at the boundary of Knuckles but its workers can only manage 2-3 days of work per month, “What do we do with these workers if we can’t pay them and the environmentalists don’t let us develop the plantation?,”asked the minister. A USD 2 billion dairy project has been proposed at Hare Park, said the Minister and added that the unions and workers have welcomed the project.
“Only milking cows will be here. The investor has said that the cows will eventually be exported when it is time to kill them. No cow will be killed here,” he said.
SLSPC Chairman Thilak Mahanama added that no proposal to build hotels in these plantations near Knuckles have been approved. He explained that only projects that were suitable to the relevant environment were approved.
