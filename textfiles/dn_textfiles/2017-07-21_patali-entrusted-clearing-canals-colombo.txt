Patali entrusted with clearing canals in Colombo

 
Megapolis and Western Development Minister Patali Champika Ranawaka was entrusted with the task of clearing blocked canals in and around Colombo.
The Cabinet Sub-Committee which met on Wednesday gave the full authority to Minister Ranawaka on this regard.
The Minister, who was previously given full authority to ensure proper and efficient garbage disposal in Colombo, could shoulder the task successfully in the last few weeks.
The new assignment comes on the heels of this success.   
Ranawaka said he will shoulder the task of clearing the canals from tomorrow by coordinating with all relevant institutions.
Starting from July 5, 754 individuals were arrested within the past 14 days for dumping garbage on the roadside, illegally.  
Garbage disposal is constantly supervised and daily reviews are conducted at 7 pm at the Colombo Municipal Council (CMC) hall with the attendance of Colombo, Moratuwa, Kotte, Dehiwala-Mount Lavinia, Kelaniya and Kaduwela Special Commissioners and the OICs, Engineers, PHIs and garbage collecting private companies namely the Abans and Care Cleaning.
