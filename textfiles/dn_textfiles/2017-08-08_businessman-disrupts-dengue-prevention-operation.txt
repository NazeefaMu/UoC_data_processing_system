Businessman disrupts dengue-prevention operation

It was reported that government officials who were involved in an operation to inspect dengue breeding sites in the Hemmathagama area, were interrupted by a businessman on August 6.
The inspection was carried in collaboration with public health inspectors and members of a three-wheeler society in the area.
Upon investigating a two-storeyed building in a commercial complex, officials had discovered dengue pupae in the premises.
It was then reported that a businessman in that commercial complex had a clash with the officials when they had made him aware of the situation. The businessman had refused to provide the officials with his name and national identity card.
It was further reported that the quarrel had come to a conclusion after the officials had warned the businessman, mentioning that they were going to implement the terms of law on him.
