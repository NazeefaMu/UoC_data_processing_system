Parents protest SLMC conspiracy on SAITM issue

A protest campaign demanding action on a conspiracy in the Sri Lanka Medical Council (SLMC) to recognise the SAITM medical degree was held at Noris Canal Road yesterday.
Prof. Ashoka Ranwala and Dr. Nimal Karunasiri led the protest.Ranwala said his two children have also studied at Medical College and as a parents they are concerned for their children who sacrifice a lot in their lives to be doctors.
“We reject outright the subcommittee and its recommendations and we believe the subcommittee will look into this crucial issue.It should be well represented with all the relevant expertise.
This subcommittee has no such representation, therefore we reject the recommendations given by this committee regarding the SAITM issue.In addition, we strongly believe that this committee is biased and partial.
The Sri Lanka Medical Council has no justifiable reason to produce this committee report to the Supreme Court or any other authority as it would further complicate this crisis.
The recommendations given by this committee contradict the government policy decision to abolish SAITM.The SLMC has no mandate to give recommendations for recognition of the SAITM degree.
