Renew your vows in front of cats

A California couple celebrated 15 years of marriage by renewing their vows while surrounded by their favorite animals: cats.
Jay and Charity Jones chose to renew their vows at The Cat House on the Kings, a cage-free cat sanctuary and adoption center in Parlier.
Video from the ceremony, which was officiated by sanctuary owner Lynea Lattanzio, shows the couple reaffirming their marriage while dozens of felines act as witnesses.
The couple said they decided after getting married in 2002 that they wouldn't have children, choosing instead to devote their lives to rescuing cats.Lattanzio said the ceremony was the first-ever vow renewal at the shelter, but it previously played host to a wedding for two cat lovers last year.
