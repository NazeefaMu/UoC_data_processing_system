Assault suspects granted bail

Four suspects including Ceylon Workers Congress Vice President and Central Provincial Council’s Tamil Education and Cultural Affairs Minister M. Rameshwaran arrested by the Maskeliya Police for allegedly assaulting and causing injuries to a group of people supporting the Kamkaru Jathika Peramuna led by Minister Palani Digambaram, were released on Rs. 400,000 surety bail each when they were produced before the Hatton District Judge and Magistrate S. Saravanaraja yesterday.
The Judge also ordered the suspects to appear in Court again on April 4 next year.
The four suspects were M. Ramesh, Vellayan Dinesh, M. Pichchamorthy and S. Baskaran.
They were produced in court after they surrendered to Police through a lawyer on December 11. Police said the alleged assault had taken place on December 7 during a funeral held at Gawarawila Group Maskeliya.
Police moved for the remanding of the suspects saying they were looking for several other suspects involved.
However, lawyers appearing for the suspects argued that this complaint had been made according to a pre-arranged plan and prayed for the release of the suspects on bail.
