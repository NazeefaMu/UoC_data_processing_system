Welikada prison riots:  two further remanded

Police Narcotics Bureau Inspector Neomal Rangajeewa and former Prisons Commissioner Emil Ranjan Lamahewa, who were in remand custody over the Welikada prison riots in 2012, were further remanded until October 2 by Colombo Additional Magistrate Priyantha Liyanage, yesterday.
Criminal Investigation Department (CID) officials informed court that the Government Analyst's report on the incident had not been received yet.
Inspector Rangajeewa of the Police Narcotics Bureau and Prisons Commissioner Lamahewa were arrested by the CID on March 28 regarding the Welikada prison riots.
Twenty-seven inmates were killed and over 20 others were injured in a shooting during the riot on November 9, 2012, when prisoners took control of the populated prison, objecting to an unannounced search by the Special Task Force to nab hidden arms, drugs and mobile phones.
