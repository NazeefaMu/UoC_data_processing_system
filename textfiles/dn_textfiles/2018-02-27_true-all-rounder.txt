A true  all-rounder

School isn’t just about academics. You need to have a well-balanced school life that includes academics, sports and extracurricular activities coupled with the joy of being surrounded by friends. So believes, Yashodha Dilesh Lakranda, the Deputy Head Prefect of Isipathana College.
“It is important to have a well-rounded sense of life that doesn’t revolve around books alone,” said Lakranda.
Lakranda is an all-rounder at school with strong academic merits and a list of extracurricular and sports achievements that are a testament to the young gentleman that he is.
Having specialized in the commerce stream, his A/L subjects included Business Studies, Economics and Accounts. In the future, he hopes to secure a good occupation in Human Resource Management as his interest lies in working with people in a business oriented environment.
Having participated in the National Cadets Crop Assessment Camp 2016 and being a young man who believes in keeping his options open, he is also considering the possibility of being an Air Force Cadet and serving his country.
Extracurricular Excellence
Lakranda is clearly a force to be reckoned with. His achievements are many and his perseverance is strong, motivating him to excel at everything he puts his mind to. The Deputy Head Prefect of Isipathana College (2017 – 2018) and the Games Vice Captain (2017 – 2018), he was within the Top 10 Leaders of College (2016) and the Top 10 Students for Extra-Curricular Activities (2016).
In spite of his green belt in Karate, Lakranda is more than just brawn. Mind over might, he was the President of the Isipathana College Debating Society (2017), Vice President of the Drama Club (2016), Treasurer of the Isipathana College Aeronautical Society (2017), Treasurer of the Buddhist Society (2018) and the Chief Organizer of the Commerce Society (2016).
During his younger years, he was a Primary School Prefect (2008), the Junior Western Band Leader (2007 - 2008) and even the Volleyball Captain for the Under 13 and Under 15 categories. He also participated in the Island-wide Interschool Hockey Tournament for the Under 13 and Under 15 categories.
He tried his hand at a variety of sports that included Karate, Swimming, Hockey, Volleyball, Athletics and Army Cadetting.
Daily Life of a DHP
As the Deputy Head Prefect (DHP) of Isipathana College, Lakranda is always on the go. With Big Match season on the horizon, his life will undoubtedly be a blur of activity. Helping to plan and organize the matches is a duty of the DHP. He helps to co-ordinate school activities with the rest of the prefects as well. The 55th Battle of the Brothers encounter between Isipathana College and Thurstan is definitely a key item on his agenda as these schools kick-start what is referred to as March Madness (Big Match Season).
However, even when there are no looming Big Matches, the life of a Deputy Head Prefect is never easy-going. He has to help maintain discipline in school, during the intervals, at assemblies and even after school ensuring that everyone maintains decorum and upholds the image of his alma mater.
Strong Support System
Like all strong leaders, Lakranda too has a strong support system on which he can depend. A loving family who are proud of his every achievement and his every venture are at the core of this support system.
“My inspiration and support is my family. They are always ready to assist me and words can never express my gratitude towards them. I also have my school principal, the prefects’ board and all my teachers to thank for all their support…” said Lakranda.
Not Just Books!
Lakranda believes that purely academic achievements are not the key to a success. He believes in building a well-rounded character and learning through experiences.
His message to his peers and the youth is to ensure that they do not rely solely on what is dictated in textbooks and the theory that is learnt but to also learn via the experiences through which one lives in the world.
“It is not just books that make one successful. A person must understand the importance of sports, extracurricular activities, teamwork and interdependence in order to truly learn. Learning occurs through experience,” concluded Lakranda.
