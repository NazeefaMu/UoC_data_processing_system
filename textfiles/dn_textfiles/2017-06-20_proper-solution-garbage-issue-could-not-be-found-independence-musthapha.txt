Proper solution for garbage issue could not be found since independence: Musthapha

Provincial Councils and Local Government Minister Faiszer Musthapha said a proper solution could not be found for the garbage issue since independence. He said this is a great example about how we think of ourselves, and our own country.
He was addressing a meeting held at the Sri Lanka Foundation, Colombo recently to raise awareness of the government and private sector regarding the establishment of the National Task Force on Waste Management.
"The garbage crisis has now created different dreadful situation within the country. The main reason for the increase of dengue is that the country does not have a proper management for Waste. Hospitals are filled with dengue patients. The general public has to go through lot of difficulties due to this problem. Only the government cannot be blamed on this matter. Each of us should be responsible for this issue," the minister said.
During the meeting, the short term and long term programmes which should be initiated to overcome the issue were discussed.
Foreign Affairs Minister Ravi Karunanayake, National Co-existence Dialogue and Official Languages Minister Mano Ganesan, Road Passenger Transport Minister Lasantha Alagiyawanna, MP Mujibur Rahman, Municipal Commissioners, Secretaries and representatives from foreign NGOs and Sri Lankan business community participated.
