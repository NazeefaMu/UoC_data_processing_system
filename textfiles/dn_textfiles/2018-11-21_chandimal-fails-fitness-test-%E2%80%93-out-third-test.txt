Chandimal fails fitness test – out of Third Test

Test captain Dinesh Chandimal will miss the third and final Test against England after failing a fitness test on his strained groin.
Chandimal underwent a test on Monday where he fielded and batted but was still uncomfortable to be passed fit to play in a five-day Test.
He suffered the injury – a grade one tear during the first Test at Galle and was ruled out of the second Test at Pallekele – both matches which Sri Lanka lost.
He was replaced in the Test squad by uncapped 21-year-old left-hander Charith Asalanka.
Suranga Lakmal who led Sri Lanka in the second Test will continue to lead in the third and final Test as well.
