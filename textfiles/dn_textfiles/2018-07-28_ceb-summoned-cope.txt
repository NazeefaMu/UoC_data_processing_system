CEB  summoned before COPE

The Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) has been summoned before the Committee on Public Enterprise (COPE) on August 7.
“The letter of summons sent by the COPE Secretary was received by the Ministry of Power and Renewable Energy,” Ministry Secretary Suren Batagoda said.
Accordingly, the Secretary to the Ministry of Power and Energy and Chairman of the CEB and several other administrative officers will appear before COPE representing the CEB.
The COPE inquiry would focus on payments done on purchasing electricity from private-owned small power producers, a source said.
Meanwhile, CEB Chairman W.B. Ganegala told the Daily News yesterday that COPE has summoned the CEB to have an understanding on how tariff is determined for wind, coal and solar power plants. “They want to have an understanding on how tariff is formulated for wind, solar and coal power plants,” he said.
