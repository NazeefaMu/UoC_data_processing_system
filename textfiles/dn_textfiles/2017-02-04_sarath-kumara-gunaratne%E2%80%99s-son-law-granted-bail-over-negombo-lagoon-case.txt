Upul Chaminda Kumarasinghe, the son-in-law of former Deputy Sarath Kumara Gunaratne held in remand custody for allegedly misappropriating Rs.12 million of public funds allocated for the Negombo Lagoon Development Project was released on bail by Colombo Chief Magistrate Lal Bandara yesterday.
The suspect who had also functioned as a private secretary to the former Deputy Minister was ordered to be released on cash bail of Rs. 25,000 with two sureties of a million rupees. The suspect was further ordered to appear before the CID on the last Sunday of every month.

CID arrested the former Fisheries Deputy Minister on January 2 for the alleged misappropriation of Rs. 12 million belonging to Ceylon Fisheries Harbour Corporation (CFHC) during the last Presidential election. The Deputy Minister is currently on bail.
Previously, CFHC former Chairman Upali Liyanage, CFHC General Manager Piyal Abeysekara, Deputy General Manager, Chandana Palpita and Lakmuni Munidasa were ordered to be released on bail regarding this incident.
The CID had named six individuals including Gunaratne, as the suspects, on the instructions of Attorney General. The Special Presidential Investigation Commission had recommended that the Attorney General’s advise be sought to institute legal action against the persons responsible for the alleged financial frauds.
The Attorney General is expecting to file indictments against the suspects in the High Court.
