Heavy happiness

Kapka Kassabova was born in Sofia, Bulgaria, in 1973, and emigrated with her family to New Zealand after the fall of the Berlin Wall; she now lives in Scotland. Her childhood summers were spent on the “red Riviera”, the southern beaches of Bulgaria on the Black Sea, where “every second barman was in the service of the Bulgarian State Security” and Stasi agents disguised themselves as holidaymakers to spy on East Germans. At night, people would attempt to cross the border, on foot or by water, into Turkey, and many paid with their lives. The forest was full of soldiers, and warning signs posted in two languages. “Once near a border”, she says, “it is impossible not to be involved, not to want to exorcise or transgress something. Just by being there, the border is an invitation.” Kassabova is drawn back thirty years later to a crossroads where the hard borders (between Bulgaria and Greece, now EU member states) have become soft, and soft borders (between Greece and Turkey) have been hardened by Europe’s attempt to control an influx of peoples displaced by recent wars. It is this attraction to the forbidden places of her youth that drives her riveting, beautifully written account of travels in Bulgaria, Turkey and Greece, Border: A journey to the edge of Europe.
For Kassabova, the past, and childhood especially, really is a foreign country. Doubly so, of course, for an émigrée who grew up under another political system. The Berlin Wall continues to divide the eras of her life. But it is this sort of dissonance that can make for a good writer, someone always on the outside, always observing. Kassabova, a poet and novelist as well as an essayist, is ideally placed to take us on a journey to a corner of Europe that even today seems exotic and little known, the shifting zone between East and West, North and South, Europe and not-Europe, NATO and the Warsaw Pact, Christianity and Islam, Balkan and Mediterranean – a region overlapping with the vague ancient expanse known as Thrace. Thrace, as Kassabova points out, was where Orpheus was torn to pieces by raving Maenads, his singing head floating down the River Hebrus (Evros).
Treasure-hunters
Kassabova’s travels form a circle, taking her from the Black Sea summer resort of her childhood to the mountain range of Strandja and on through the plains of Thrace, the Rhodope range and Greece, and then back to Strandja. In this region nearly everyone is at only one or two generational removes from exile and displacement, scattered among three alphabets and several nations; and along the way Kassabova meets treasure-hunters, refugees, retired spies, smugglers, hunters, botanists, healers, artists, Gypsies (Roma), forest rangers and border guards. She brings to her account a deep understanding of the region’s Byzantine (literally and figuratively) and Ottoman history, wearing her learning lightly.
The Balkan peoples are perhaps not renowned for a sense of humour, though a fatalistic sense of the absurd is endemic. Kassabova, though, is funny; her wry wit leavens the narrative and keeps it from collapsing under the weight of cumulative tragedy. “It is hard to identify one strand of this story as the kookiest, but the Uzbek-bred vipers are hard to beat”, she writes at one point. “Back in the house, Ziko and Nikos were in the late stages of lachrymose male bonding”, she writes at another. An affectless waitress always plonks down food for customers with the grim exhortation “Enjoy”; a kleptocrat’s villa is categorized as “gangster-baroque”. And Kassabova has a novelist’s flair for character sketch; there is, for example, the “lost-looking Dutchman out of a Graham Greene novel” who “seemed to drift towards the East, dressed in light linens”.
Kassabova begins in Strandja, the “last mountain range of south-east Europe”, whose forest, having escaped the Ice Age, preserves “a veritable open-air museum of relic species” from the Tertiary age. She settles in a place she calls simply “the Village in the Valley”, a beautiful but underinhabited place.
Arbitrarily uprooted
The village is dying; there is no work, few visitors and no children, though the mayor has aspirationally constructed a school. The village had been Greek before the Balkan Wars (1912–13); in the euphemistic “exchange of populations”, the resident Greeks had been moved to the villages around Thessaloníki, and the vacated village resettled by Bulgarian refugees from Turkey. Again and again in her travels, Kassabova encounters peoples who have been arbitrarily uprooted and moved to “an empty house in a foreign country with the kitchen pots still warm”. (Besides the population exchanges of the Balkan wars, Kassabova mentions a more recent but perhaps lesser-known incident, the expulsion of 340,000 ethnic Turks from Bulgaria in 1989.) It emerges here that empires, despite their problems, are in some ways the lesser of two evils, mixers of ethnicities, languages and faiths; nation states, by contrast, have been catastrophic centrifuges, “unmixers” of peoples, particularly in the Balkans. Kassabova describes, among other colourful episodes, witnessing Greek and Bulgarian fire walkers (in an ecstatic rite involving walking over live coals), and placing herself in the hands of smugglers on the “Road to Freedom”, crossing into Greece on foot without a passport. She also relates a bizarre legend-cumconspiracy-theory straight out of an Indiana Jones movie, involving a secret ancient Egyptian pyramid, radiation, Nazis, Soviets, a clairvoyant and the Bulgarian Minister of Culture. Poetic interludes define words from different languages or tell short allegories: agiasma is Greek for “curative spring”; klyon, the nickname Bulgarian border soldiers gave the razor-wire fence; zmey, “In Slavic folk mythology, a shape-shifting dragon that embodies protection and possession”; chesma, Turkish for a road-side public fountain; uroki, Bulgarian for the evil eye. The vocabulary of food and drink bridges cultures. Turks are amused when Kassabova calls parsley maydanoz “because it’s one of those Turkish food words that have seeped into Balkan mouths permanently. The words for food can’t be ethnically purged”. (In Greek it is Maïdanos, possibly a corruption of a word meaning “Macedonian”.)
The West tends to view Greece as relatively poor, and politically insignificant except for its nuisance value. It is easy to forget that within the region, Greece is relatively prosperous, with a GDP of more than all of her Northern neighbours – Albania, Bulgaria and the (once Yugoslav) Republic of Macedonia – combined. Greece also has a cultural prestige that is the envy of the area.
