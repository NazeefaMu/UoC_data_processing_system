Blooming floral wreaths

Designer Olga Prinku combines her background in graphic design with her love of all-things crafty to create striking floral letter art. Each piece is rendered within large embroidery hoops; however, rather than stitching with yarn or thread, Prinku uses hundreds of real flowers, leaves, and seeds to form each letter shape.
“This particular technique of weaving flowers on tulle actually came to me in a dream,” Prinku reveals. After the initial idea struck, she began experimenting with fresh flowers but soon realized that their natural wilting process meant her designs would soon fall apart.
“Now I use dry flowers,” Prinku explains.
“Some I buy readily dried, and some I pick from fresh and dry myself using silica gel. I also collect seed pods at the end of the season, which I use as they are.”
Delicate botanicals are seen meticulously arranged in colourful patterns, together creating a blooming alphabet of bold serif-type wreaths. From white daisies and pastel-pink poppies to red leaves and rust-colored buds, Prinku’s colour palette is informed depending on the season.
“I’m still learning a lot through experimenting about what flowers are the best,” she reveals.
“I’m basically looking for ones that are good at holding their colour when dry and that have thin stems that I can use on the tulle.”
With each new design, Prinku’s love of nature grows fonder.
She says, “I’ve become much more observant about the plants that are growing all around where I live, and that fuels my creativity too.”
Letter art is not the only thing she focuses on. She artfully weaves dried flowers and small odds and ends together to turn just about any surface that can be woven around into something truly special. From the back of a Bertoia chair to a shirt collar, Olga has used her dried flower collection to decorate so many amazing objects.
