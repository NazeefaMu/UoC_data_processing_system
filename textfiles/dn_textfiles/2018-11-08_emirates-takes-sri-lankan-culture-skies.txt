Emirates takes Sri Lankan culture to the skies

There’s nothing quite like watching a movie in one’s own language, or listening to the music of a favourite local artist to feel at home even at 35,000 feet, a fact that Emirates, one of the world’s largest airline, has invested in with an award-winning inflight entertainment system that caters to hundreds of nationalities including Sri Lankans.
Taking Sri Lankan popular culture to the skies across the world, Emirates’ ice (Information, Communications, Entertainment) inflight entertainment system offers four Sinhala movies and 13 channels of Sinhala music, catering to a wide palette of genres and styles that will surprise and delight travellers from the paradise isle.
The selection, featured in the latest Emirates ice Guide on board Emirates flights and viewable at www.emirates.com encompasses movies in the comedy, historical drama and romance genres, with titles like Bimba Devi alias Yashodhara, Dr. Nawariyan, Porisadaya and Nilanjana. The choice of Sinhala music on ice is eclectic, ranging from the classics of Pandit W. D. Amaradeva, Victor Rathnayake and Nanda Malini to the evergreen hits of Clarence Wijewardena, Keerthi Pasquel, Jananath Warakagoda, Freddie Silva and C. D. Fonseka; and the vocal stylings of Deepika Priyadarshani Peiris, Shanika Sumanasekera, Priyani Jayasinghe, and Shashika Nisansala.
For Tamil speaking passengers, ice also features 10 Tamil movies, two Tamil TV shows and two music channels including the hits of A. R. Rahman that are enjoyed by many Sri Lankans.
