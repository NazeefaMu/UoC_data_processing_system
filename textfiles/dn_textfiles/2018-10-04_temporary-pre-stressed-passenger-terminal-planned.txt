Temporary pre-stressed passenger terminal planned

Plans are afoot to build a temporary pre-stressed passenger terminal for the convenience of air passengers until the Bandaranaike International Airport (BIA) expansion project is completed, Co-cabinet Spokesman and Lands and Parliamentary Reforms Minister Gayantha Karunathilake said yesterday.
Accordingly, a passenger terminal facilitating 15 million passengers per year, will be built at the BIA under this expansion project.
The proposal made by Transport and Civil Aviation Minister Nimal Siripala De Silva, to handover the contract to the China State Construction Engineering Corporation Ltd. for the construction of pre-stressed passenger terminal under the recommendations of the Procurement Appeal Board (PAB), was approved by the Cabinet yesterday.
