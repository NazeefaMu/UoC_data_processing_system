The enduring enigma of Véra Nabokov

“The more you leave me out,” Véra Nabokov told Brian Boyd while he was researching his two-volume biography of her husband, Vladimir Nabokov, “the closer to the truth you’ll be.” Not that biographers could be trusted to follow her dictum: Véra destroyed all her letters to her husband; she blacked out her contributions to joint postcards to Vladimir’s mother. In Véra (Mrs. Vladimir Nabokov), Stacey Schiff characterizes this destruction a question of “merit”: “His words, even his private ones, had a value for posterity. She felt strongly that hers did not.”
But when Schiff describes Véra’s reaction to Vladimir’s 1937 affair with Irina Guadanini—not his only infidelity, but the only one that threatened his marriage—another reason surfaces. “Until confronted with the fact that her husband’s 1937 letters to Irina had survived,” Schiff writes, “she was ready to deny that any such affair had taken place.” Schiff also remarks on Véra’s contributions to a published collection of Vladmir’s correspondence. The four letters Véra asked the volume’s editors to use were “adoring”; they had also been sent while Vladimir was courting Irina. It was, Schiff writes, “a bold, unblinking strike on all other versions of their story.”
Self-erasure
What other “versions of their story” Véra’s missing letters to Vladimir might suggest, we will never know. And yet: Her careful self-erasure creates a kind of black hole, a magnetic absence. Véra may well have been driven to destroy her letters to Vladmir by a desire for privacy—of which there is ample evidence: when Véra was pregnant with their son Dmitri, she concealed her condition from many of the couple’s closest friends through “careful dress and posture and silence.” But her reserve piques, rather than dissuades, interest. And Véra, intelligent as she was, cannot have been ignorant of this possibility.
Into this absence steps Adrienne Celt’s Invitation to a Bonfire, a novel that imagines an affair between a young Russian refugee, Zoya Andropova, and a Nabokov-like novelist, Leo (Lev) Orlov; Lev’s wife is Vera, without the accent. Celt introduces intrigue of a more immediate sort—a murder; a second death that occurs under “hotly debated circumstances”—but the novel’s true interest is power; specifically narrative power—one of the few kinds available to women in the first half of the 20th century.
Mutual devotion
In the pantheon of literary marriages, Véra Slonim’s to Vladimir Nabokov is remarkable for the consistency of its mutual devotion: his to her; her to his work.
The Nabokovs were married for 52 years, and Boyd writes that “they seemed like young lovers even in their sixties and seventies.” No less astounding is the fact that, until 1968—that is, until Véra was 66 years old—Vladimir did not employ a regular secretary, leaving to his wife the bulk of the typing: not only his novels (which needed to be copied out in triplicate), but his correspondence—and this is to say nothing of the miles she drove, the contracts she negotiated, the meals she prepared.
In 1946, when Vladimir was suffering the stultifying effects of instructing undergraduates in “rudimentary [Russian] grammar” at Wellesley, Véra convinced her husband to propose a Russian Literature class he was eager to teach but unenthusiastic about prepping by “promising to write the lectures herself.”
Two years later, on the morning of the couple’s move from Massachusetts to Ithaca, New York—Vladimir had accepted a position at Cornell—Véra shuffled her husband off to a friend’s apartment while she settled things at their own. “I will never get this place cleaned out if he stays here,” she explained.
