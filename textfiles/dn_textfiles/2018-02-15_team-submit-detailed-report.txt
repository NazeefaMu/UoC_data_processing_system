Extradition of Udayanga Weeratunga:
Team to submit detailed report

The team of Sri Lankan representatives who went to Dubai to seek the extradition of Sri Lanka’s former Ambassador to Russia Udayanga Weeratunga to Sri Lanka returned home on February 13.
This was after laying the ground work to submit a detailed report including relevant documents and legal submissions to relevant authorities in Dubai.
The follow up action on this matter would be handled by the Sri Lankan Embassy in UAE, Attorney General Jayantha Jayasuriya said.
The Attorney General said they would take further action on the matter depending on the response received from relevant authorities in Dubai.
