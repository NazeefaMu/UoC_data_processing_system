National Council for Road Safety initiates public transport survey

National Council for Road Safety Chairman Dr. Sisira Kodagoda said a survey on the highest priority issues in the public transport sector including passengers’ satisfaction with modes of transport in Sri Lanka was initiated yesterday.
The Chairman further said that the survey will give priority to ascertain whether the travel needs of the passengers are fulfilled by the current bus, train, and three-wheeler services.
The National Institute of Social Development (NISD) will conduct the survey and the final recommendations will be implemented after performing an analysis, Dr. Kodagoda stated.
“Passenger surveys have been the mainstay of many successful public transport agencies. We must get to know the people’s opinion about the level of service provided by the public transport sector,” he said.
Dr. Kodagoda said that survey solutions will help to resolve many problems pertaining to the public transport system in the country.
