Therefore, he requested all the SLFPers to give a new lease of life to the party under the leadership of the President. He was addressing a SLFP meeting held at Tangalle recently.
The Minister said he was vested with yet another state ministry because the President is confident that he will serve the people to their utmost satisfaction.
