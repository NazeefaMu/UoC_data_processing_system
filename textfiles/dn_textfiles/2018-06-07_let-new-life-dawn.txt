LET A NEW LIFE DAWN....

By giving identity to our own language, we have erected an additional barrier to further separate us from our own people who are suffering from conflicts arising from man made barriers. All barriers erected by man to isolate him from other men need to be demolished to bring true peace and harmony to the world we live in. Till such time as we have a universal language or method of communication with each other, the only way we have to break through the language barrier is by translation.
Dr. Kandiah Shriganeshan’s attempt is an admirable effort to cut across the language barrier and bring the South Asian writers together through the English translations.
In ‘Suthanthiram - South Asian Poetry in Translation’ and ‘My Choice’ Dr. Kandiah Shriganeshan has made a major contribution to the world of poetry through his translations. His contribution is important not only for the poets and the readers, but also for the students of Translation Studies, as he happens to be the coordinator of the Translation Studies unit of the University of Jaffna. Shriganeshan has published the poems both in English and Tamil.
‘Suthanthiram’ is a selection of poems from the SAARC region, collected from several anthologies. Several poems are from the anthology ‘Amaravati Poetic Prism’, with 948 poems written in 85 languages, along with the English translations of every poem. A few are from the publications of the Foundation of SAARC Writers And Literature (FOSWAL) founded by Ajeet Caur. Some poems were written in English, but most of the others written in the poet’s mother tongue and translated into English. It is never an easy task to translate a translation, specially when it comes to poetry. It is a challenge that Shriganeshan had accepted, giving us all an opportunity to enjoy the creativity of our fellow poets, our own brothers and sisters separated by geographical, political and language barriers.
Among the poets Shriganeshan has selected are academics from leading universities and well known award winning poets, including some of the great names not only in their own countries but in all of South Asia, and beyond. To name a few, we have Sitakant Mahapatra, Muhammad Nurul Huda, and K. V. Dominic, poets spanning eight South Asian countries, their ages ranging from nine to eighty. They are from all over South Asia, separated by the political barriers, but united in their universal link language, English, though originally written in Pushito, Urdu, Punjabi, Malayalam, Butanese, Sinhala, Bengali, Sindhi and Hindi.
It would have been wonderful if poetry too could be created in a universal language like the language of the artist, the musician and the sculptor. We have to depend on translations for all literary works till someday mankind is able to develop a universal language. Till such time the translator has a major role to play and a major responsibility to select the best works and give us the best possible translation.
“My Choice” is Shriganeshan’s choice of 30 poems by 25 poets writing in Tamil. This selection would not have been easy, probably because the Sri Lanka Tamil poetry would be as good and as numerous as any poetry around the world. This is an opportunity for us in the South to read, understand and empathise with the people in the North and East of our country. The poems are thought provoking, making us close the book, close our eyes, and try to see the poem through the poet’s mind. ‘Wants’ by Ilangeswari tells us of what all of us want, but most of us never get, whether our lives are cut off very early or we live to old age. The social revolution and the new freedom enjoyed by young women is symbolised in ‘Wheels’ by Thabiluvil Jega. We can feel the sadness of all mothers, all over the world, throughout history, in ‘My Tender Child’ by Jayanthy Thalayasingam. Her poem ‘Mammoty’ reminds us that the same mammoty we use for planting our crops has to be used to bury the dead too. Mullai Musrifa has summed up the position with all the misunderstandings and the fanaticism about the world religions in ‘The long story of aggression’.
Translation is what we need, for unity among all poets and the readers, using English as our link language, and to share our creativity, our culture, heritage and feelings. Translation is also a weapon to battle against language chauvinism which prevents us from respecting and trying to learn the language of our fellow beings. When institutions and organizations which have the infrastructure and the facilities have failed to bring out anthologies in translation, hold conferences and discussions among the literati, it is up to the individual writers and translators to carry on their mission of unification. It is also time for Sinhala translators to make their contributions too.
Shriganeshan should continue the good work to collect more poetry not only from South Asia but also from all Asia and then the world. We wish him success in all his endeavours.
As Aruwil wrote in ‘The son who left home without a word’,
“Don’t lose the humane qualities
Learn how to love people”
and Ampuli in ‘Seek and you will find’,
“let a new life dawn in your hands”
for all poetry and literary creations.
