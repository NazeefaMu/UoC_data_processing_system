‘Bus Only’ lane to cover many roads in Colombo

The ‘Bus Only’ lane will be extended to many parts of Colombo and the suburbs as it received Cabinet approval this week after its initial success in Rajagiriya.
The ‘Bus Only’ lane provision would be made available during peak hours on roads of Moratuwa-Ratmalana, Wellawatte-Colpetty on the Galle road, from Parliament junction to Rajagiriya, Borella, Maradana, Pettah and Colombo Fort in Parliament Road, from the roundabout in Chittampalam A. Gardiner Mw to Pettah, Thummullah Junction to Museum Junction and Eye Hospital roundabout to Thummulla Junction.
The ‘Bus Only’ lane has been put forward by the Megapolis and Western Development Ministry as a suitable short term measure until other proposals such as the Light Rail Transit system and electrification of trains are implemented as part of the Megapolis to improve public transport.
A pilot project for the ‘Bus Only’ lane was implemented from the Rajagiriya Junction to the Ayurveda junction from March 12-23. Results showed while the earlier measured speed of a vehicle during traffic between Borella to Welikada junction was 9.5km/hr during the trial, buses achieved speeds up to 20km/hr.
A survey by the University of Moratuwa revealed that “over 50 percent of users indicated significant travel time savings, while 70 percent wanted the project to continue to permanency and over 60 percent wanted it extended to other roads.
The bus lane benefited more than 4O percent of the commuters even though it carried 5 percent of the vehicles.
