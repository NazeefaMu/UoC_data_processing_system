SriLankan paid  Rs 36.8 mn to ad firm twice

SriLankan Airlines had paid out Rs 36.8 million to Kuma Stickers for advertising hoardings under Board approval despite an audit query about continuous payments made to the same company for the same service.
This was disclosed before the Presidential Commission investigating alleged fraud, corruption and misappropriation of state funds and property in SriLankan Airlines, SriLankan Catering Services and Mihin Lanka during its sittings on July 16.
Cross examined by Deputy Solicitor General Milinda Pathirana, SriLankan Airlines Marketing Manager Sidath Savinda Perera said this payment was approved by the SriLankan Airlines Board of Directors on July 29, 2014.
The Board of Directors comprised Nishantha Wickramasinghe (Chairman), Kapila Chandrasena (Chief Executive Officer), Nihal Jayamanne PC, Shashindra Rajapaksa, Manilal Fernando, Lakshmi Sangakkara and Sanath Ukwatte.
Perera said the Board of Directors had approved the payment notwithstanding an audit query about continuous payments to one and the same institution.
The money was paid out in respect of advertising hoardings put up at Koggala, Hambantota Highway, Tangalle, Dickwella, Katunayake 18th mile post, Kundasale, Nuwara Eliya, Grandpass, Katunayake and Yakkala.
