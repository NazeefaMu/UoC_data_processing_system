Gynaecologist on leave causes hardships to patients

Expectant mothers admitted to Mahiyangana Hospital were transferred to the Kandy and Badulla hospitals since the Consultant Obstetrician and Gynaecologist had gone on leave and not reported to work, Mahiyangana Hospital Director Dr. A.M. Senarath Bandara said. He said, the Mahiyangana hospital, which served people in five health districts with a minimum staff, had faced great difficulties owing to the abscence of an obstetrician and gynaecologist.
The recent death of an expectant mother at the Mahiyangana hospital ignited a public protest campaign opposite the hospital and the only available obstetrician and gynaecologist who went on leave had not reported back to work for fear of his life, he added.
