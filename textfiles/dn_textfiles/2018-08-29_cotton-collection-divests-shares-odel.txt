The Cotton Collection Private Limited said that the company has divested shares to Softlogic Holdings PLC’s subsidiary, ODEL PLC with effect from yesterday.

The retail arm of the Softlogic Group has a very strong footprint in the retail sector spanning the verticals of fashion, consumer electronics and furniture.

Ashok Pathirage, Chairman of Softlogic Holdings PLC said, “Today marks a very momentous occasion in our journey to be Sri Lanka’s largest fashion and lifestyle retailer. Cotton Collection is a great brand that we have witnessed evolving over the years. It has its own loyal customer following and we feel this acquisition would form a perfect <U+FB01>t for our aspirations in elevating the fashion retail landscape of the country.”
