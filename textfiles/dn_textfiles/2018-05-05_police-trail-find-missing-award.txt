Police on the trail to find missing award

Public Administration and Law and Order Minister Ranjith Maddumabandara yesterday said a special investigation will be conducted under the supervision of a DIG over the disappearance of an award won by veteran film maker Dr. Lester James Peries from the Indian Government in 1964.
This award had gone missing from Wednesday evening and a complaint over the incident had been made to the Bambalapitiya police by the family member of late Dr Lester Peries over the phone.
The Bambalapitiya police had deployed a team to investigate into the incident as they received the complaint.
Minister Maddumabandara said the police are following several leads and expressed hope of an imminent breakthrough.
