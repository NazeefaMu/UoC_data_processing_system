FM to meet Modi during first overseas visit

Newly appointed Foreign Minister Tilak Marapana embarked on a three-day official visit to India yesterday. The visit to India marks his first official engagement overseas since assuming office in August.
In a press release, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs said that Minister Marapana will hold discussions with his Indian Counterpart Sushma Swaraj.
“Minister Marapana will meet his Indian counterpart, External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj on September 9 for discussions on a range of bilateral issues aimed at further strengthening the India-Sri Lanka partnership.”
The Minister is also set to meet Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi on the same day.
Marapana’s visit follows previous visits by Foreign Ministers Ravi Karunanayake and Mangala Samaraweera, both of whose first trips overseas were also to India.
Marapana will be accompanied on his visit by Secretary to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs Prasad Kariyawasam and M.A.K. Girihagama, Senior Director General of the South Asia and SAARC Division of the Ministry.
