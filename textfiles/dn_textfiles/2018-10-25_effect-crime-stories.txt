The effect of  crime stories

Detective stories tend to glorify crimes. Murderers, gangsters and crooks are always shown as tough, cunning and courageous people who get on with their job for a considerable time.
Movies are greatly responsible for making many people take the path of crime by making crimes look attractive. Police are shown as stupid and slow and civil characters shine by contrast. Many bank robberies and museum thefts were being planned and executed after the fashion of movies and crime thrillers came into existence.
Newspapers give glorious details of a murder or suicide with the details of drugs and methods used by the killers or the victims. The media has a moral duty towards its public. Giving attractive headlines, or publishing false information, to create alarm among its readers, are to be curbed. Yellow journalism will never appeal to the baser instincts of people. Text books are there to nurture value among the young minds. It is surprising after spending a lot of money, human energy and intelligence, the choice of lessons is so poor.
For example the villain is presented as an attractive character casual, brave, smart and successful with women. It is true that he finally gets caught. The whole lesson will deal glorifying the quick success of an immoral character. The events and situation will impress the reader and he might conclude that the life of crime is worth risking. Terrorists grow in our thoughts with a ‘Halo’ of glory, as we are unable to stop their mindless killings. Is glorifying crimes not a crime?
