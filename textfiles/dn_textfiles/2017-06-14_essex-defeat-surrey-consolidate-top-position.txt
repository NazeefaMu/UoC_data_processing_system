Essex defeat Surrey to consolidate top position

LONDON, Monday: Two counties that pressed for the title until the final day of last season’s English Championship combined to produce a gripping finale at Taunton on Monday. It ended with a three-run victory for Yorkshire. They went top of the table, at least for a few hours, while Somerset’s fears of relegation are now impossible to ignore.
Tom Westley’s 108 not out, and an equally fine innings of 77 from Nick Browne, took Essex to an emphatic eight-wicket victory against Surrey at Guildford which takes them to the top of the County Championship Division One table.
Needing 253, from a minimum of 83 overs, after they had bowled Surrey out a second time for 288 earlier in the day, Essex reached 253 for 2 little more than half-an-hour after tea and always looked totally in control despite a wearing last-day pitch.
Westley was joined in an unbroken third-wicket partnership of 105 in 27 overs by Dan Lawrence, who finished unbeaten on 32. Essex took 24 points from their third win of the season, with Surrey having to settle for seven.
Since gaining promotion last year, Essex have surprised the rest of the first division with their early-season success - but this was a comprehensive win against a team who themselves led Division One until the last round of matches and was achieved despite seamer Matt Quinn suffering a back spasm on day one which has prevented him from bowling since.
