President should take over for 24 hours: GMOA

President Maithripala Sirisena should take over the duties of the Health Minister and the Higher Education Minister for 48 hours, do justice and hand them over to them back if the two ministers do not do their official duties regarding the SAITM, Government Medical Officers' Association (GMOA) Secretary Dr. Navin De Zoyza said. Addressing a press conference at the GMOA Head Quarters in Colombo 7 yesterday, Dr. Zoysa said it takes only 24 hours for the two ministers to do their official duties towards SAITM and at least the President should order them to do so. Using the powers vested on him by the Medical Ordinance, the Health Minister can sign the 2009 Gazette Notification on the minimum standards of medical education or he can gazette the standards published on the Sri Lanka Medical Council (SLMC) website as a booklet.
According to Dr. Zoyza, using the powers vested with the Higher Education Minister by the University Act No. 16 of 1978, he can obtain the Compliance Certificate for the SAITM from the the SLMC or if he fails to do so, he can cancel the `gazette notification' issued by the former Higher Education Minister S.B. Dissanayake.
Dr. Zoyza said both current and former higher education ministers are clowns. No point of talking to them, he said. Doctors cannot be created the way that of creating politicians. They come to Parliament to test their standards, and doctors start serving after proving their standard.
The GMOA has not used its full power to address the issue; if there is no positive answer from the Government, the GMOA does not hesitate to use its full power to solve the issue.
The Health Minister is trying to implement the decision made at his home instead of implementing the decision made by the SLMC because of his `love' towards people.
He should protect or at least keep the current standard of the doctors who prescribe high quality drugs, heart stents and eye lenses which he made available at lower prices for people, he added.
