The best buildings  in the world revealed

The world’s biggest architecture awards has been accepting entries for its 2017 competition – and the entries are stunning.
The World Architecture Festival celebrates its tenth edition in Berlin in November and has released highlights from the 924 entries it has received so far for its awards programme, with the shortlist containing projects based across 68 countries and architectural practices from 51 nations.

Some of the eye-catching designs picked out by the judges include a futuristic pharmacy in Japan, a space-aged illuminous footbridge in Berlin and the British Airways i360 observation deck in Brighton.
The Smile landmark project in London, the Petersen Automotive Museum in Los Angeles and the Zhuhal Opera House in China have also been commended.
Architects from the UK are most widely represented on the shortlist, closely followed by colleagues in the USA, Australia and Turkey, with entries from Asia up by a third year-on-year.
