Troops in humanitarian effort in Mullaitivu to mark Poson Poya

In what could be considered a mammoth and noble welfare project to upgrade the living standards of the people of Mullaittivu, the Security Force Headquarters – Mullaittivu (SFHQ-MLT) in close coordination and sponsorship of the Embilipitiya Sri Bodhi Raja Foundation of Ven. (Dr) Omalpe Sobhitha Nayaka Thera, gave away a colossal stock of humanitarian goods on Poson Poya Day (27), during a mega event at the Mullaittivu public grounds.
The distribution of a herd of 100 dairy cows to selected 100 underprivileged families, 50 wheelchairs for the handicapped and to remote hospitals, 150 gift parcels of school books and accessories, each worth about Rs.1,000 to students, 150 mammoty blades for the poor agrarian community and several other relief packs, took place during this huge event, supported by Thai and Singaporean philanthropists and other donors of the Foundation.
In response to a request of Security Forces – Mullaittivu (SF-MLT) Commander Major General Dushyantha Rajaguru, Ven. (Dr.) Omalpe Sobhitha Nayaka Thera, in order to support ongoing healthy reconciliation gestures of the Army, all of which have been prioritised by the Army Commander under his visionary ‘nation-building’ concept, voluntarily came forward to offer his generosity by way of this mega donation, worth more than Rs. 5.5 million. SFHQ-MLT, taking note of the fact that the Mullaittivu district is the worst poverty-affected zone in the country, has intensified its community-oriented roles in collaboration with the District Secretariat, Divisional Secretariats, state officials and Grama Niladhari officials at ground level.
Such welfare projects are carried out regularly by the troops in all formations under command to the SFHQ- MLT by way of conducting health clinics and distribution of nutrients, school accessories, clothes, medicine, push bicycles, scholarships, tree saplings, spectacles, vegetable and fruit seedlings, school uniforms, roof sheets, and home utensils.
Selection of the recipients, coordination and the guidance for the donation were made by General Officers Commanding of the 59, 64 and 68 Divisions of the SFHQ-MLT in close touch with respective state officials at village levels.
In addition, Mullaittivu troops offer their unfailing assistance to dig drinking water and agrarian wells for civilians on request since such work would cost them heavily if the private sector involvement were used for the purpose. Northern Province Governor Reginald Cooray attended the distribution ceremony as the chief guest in Mullaittivu.
Ven. (Dr.) Omalpe Sobhitha Nayaka Thera, Chief Sangha Nayak of the Sourthern Province in Sri Lanka Ramagnna Nikaya and Chief Sangha Nayaka of Singapore who is also the pioneering architect of Mullaittivu’s welfare initiative thanked the Army for all the support and its painstaking efforts for screening of the most wanted and all other related arrangements before those reliefs were given away.
Buddhist, Hindu, Islamic and Catholic religious dignitaries, Mullaittivu District Secretary Rupawathi Kethishwaran, Commander, Security Forces – Mullaittivu Major General Dushyantha Rajaguru, Killinochchi District DIG Mahinda Gunaratne, Mullaittivu District SP Wasantha Kandewatta, and representatives from Thailand and Singapore, donors to the project, senior officials of the Education Department, agriculture, health, veterinary surgeons, senior officers of the Armed Forces, school students, parents and a gathering of civilians witnessed the mammoth welfare project.
