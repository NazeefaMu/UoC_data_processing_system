Next LG poll under hybrid system - Mustapha

The government hopes to hold the next local government elections under the proposed Hybrid system, Provincial Councils and Local Government Minister Faizer Mustapha said yesterday.
“Under this system, 70 percent will be elected under the wards system and 30 percent under the mixed proportionate system,” the minister said.
Musthapha said a study on the delimitation of electoral boundaries has been conducted and currently the authorities were discussing on some disputed areas.
Out of the 335 local government bodies, 312 were being administered by a special commissioner after their term of office expired recently.
The term of office of some of the remaining Municipal Councils, Urban Councils and Pradeshiya Sabhas will end on October 16 and the rest on October 31. Local Government and Provincial Councils Deputy Minister Karunaratne Paranavithana said according to Act 2012 No 22, all local government elections should be under the new mixed system.
“The next election should be held under the new system. The term of office of all local government bodies will expire by October 31 and the election should be held within a short period,” he said. Paranavithana added that there are some critical observations by political forces about the proposed new system.
“There are main criticisms against the new system. One is that the demarcation of constituencies is not transparent and not inclusive. It means that ideas of all stake holders have not been taken into consideration.” he said.
The deputy minister also said that the introduction of a multi-member constituency was also a little problematic.
“Some say that the principle of multi-member constituency has been violated. There really are no multi-member constituencies. There are some ethnic divisions,” he said.
Paranavithana said it is widely accepted that women’s quota for local bodies should be guaranteed. “The accepted quota is 30 percent. But this is 0 percent. There is no guarantee for women’s quota. Some suggest that we should introduce another amendment to the Act and go for the election,” the deputy minister said. He said the Local Government and Provincial Councils Minister also has the power to appoint another committee to look into these grievances and make his recommendations.
“The minister is going to appoint a committee and take all matters into consideration. Another Cabinet sub committee has also been appointed headed by Minister Kabir Hashim to study these issues and suggest some recommendations to the Cabinet,” Paranavithana said.
