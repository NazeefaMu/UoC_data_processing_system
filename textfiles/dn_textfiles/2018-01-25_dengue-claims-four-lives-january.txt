Dengue claims four lives in January

A total of 4,271 dengue cases and around four (4) deaths had been reported during the past 22 days of this year, Epidemiology Unit sources said yesterday.
According to the sources, the highest number of dengue cases (757) had been reported from the Colombo district while the second highest number (400) had been reported from the Jaffna district. The third highest number of dengue cases (373) had been reported from the Batticaloa district.
The Colombo Municipal Council (CMC) reported a total of 297 dengue cases during the same period. The other parts of the Colombo district recorded a total of 460 dengue cases. The total number of dengue cases reported from the Western Province is 1,367.
Meanwhile, medical experts and consultants advise the public to seek medical treatment without delay for any type of fever without applying home remedies. All fever patients need rest and they should not attend work or school.
All fever patients should take Paracetamol only. All the other medications, especially Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) such as Ibuprofen cause Dengue hemorrhagic Fever (DHF) which can become fatal, they said.
