Shun DMK-Congress front, vote for me, says Jayalalithaa

 
 
 Reviving the Sri Lankan Tamils issue at the close of Assembly election campaign, Chief Minister and AIADMK general secretary, J. Jayalalithaa, on Friday warned that the DMK-Congress alliance would pose a `great danger’ to efforts of island Tamils fighting to retrieve their rights.
 
In an indirect reference to the alliance, she said the political alliance described as ‘Kooda Natpu’ (bad company) was responsible for the massacre of lakhs of island Tamils. The alliance which separated had joined hands together with the new description of ‘Otti pirandhavargal’ (born together), she said in an apparent reference to the remarks of DMK treasurer M.K. Stalin that DMK and Congress were twins who could not be separated.
 
In an open letter to party cadres, she hit out at the family politics of  DMK and asked the party cadre to remind voters about the previous DMK rule when newspapers, radio, television channels, film production and distribution, besides right to conduct cricket matches  went to the control of a single family.
 
Jayalalithaa said “If the poisonous tree of family politics strengthens its roots, it will be perilous to individual freedom”. During DMK rule from 2006-2011, ruling party functionaries grabbed land and other property of people, she said and added that people would not have forgotten the incidents.  “The DMK is using the huge money it earned through scams like 2G and indulging in a propaganda through newspapers and other media, in a bid to erase from people’s mind, the historical blunders and crimes committed by the party”. She asked the party cadre to defeat the ‘propaganda tactics of the family members of the evil force’ through tireless work. She sought votes for performance of her government. (deccanchronicle)
