Allegation of felling trees at Wilpattu
Range Bandara threatens to file defamation case

Irrigation State Minister Palitha Range Bandara said he will file a defamation case within the next two weeks against those who made defamatory remarks against him claiming that he had felled trees at Wilpattu National Park.
Addressing the media yesterday at his Ministry, the State Minister said he had already instructed his lawyer to file a case against Ven. Pahiyangala Ananda Sagara Thera and two environmental activists Sajeewa Chamikara and Nayanaka Ranwella, claiming Rs. 500 million from each person for allegedly making defamatory remarks against him.
Denying the allegations leveled against him, the State Minister said he was ready to resign from his post if it was proved that he had engaged in felling trees in the area.
The State Minister said Pukkulam is a village established in 1938 under Thalpitiya DRO and then in 1992 it was gazetted as a village under Wanathawilluwa Divisional Secretariat in Puttalam.
“There are 132 underprivileged fisher families living in this village without even the basic facilities such as electricity and other essentials,” he said.
