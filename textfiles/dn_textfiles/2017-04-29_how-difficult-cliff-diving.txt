How Difficult is Cliff Diving?

Prelude to Red Bull Cliff Diving World Series :
The Degree of Difficulty varies between 3.6 for a required dive and 6.3 for the most difficult dives in the sport currently. The degree of difficulty (DD) is the rating for each dive performed in a competition and is multiplied by the sum of the judges’ scores to give the total number of points per dive.
Each trick in a high dive adds to the degree of difficulty and the athletes of the Red Bull Cliff Diving World Series keep pushing the limits of their sport by creating and realising new dives which weren’t even considered possible a few years ago.
“I came to my dives just by a natural progression. I started off doing a back triple with two twists and eventually added two more twists to get to the back triple quad. My other dive at the start was a front triple with 1 1/2 twists and I started adding a twist and then decided to take away a twist but add a somersault,” says the man who introduced the first dive conceived exclusively for cliff diving, Gary Hunt.
The reigning champion of the World Series premiered his triple quad – three somersaults with four twists – with an unbelievable DD of 6.3 in 2009 and has perfected this striking weapon over the past seasons.
Only since the start of this season have two more athletes added dives with a DD of more than 6.0 to their portfolio: Russia’s Artem Silchenko – back armstand 2 1/2 somersaults with 2 1/2 twists has a DD of 6.1 – and Blake Aldridge from England who learned his back armstand 2 1/2 somersaults with 4 twists at the US leg in Boston a few weeks ago is now the second athlete performing a dive with a DD of 6.3.
The DD value depends on the kind of manoeuvres, somersaults and twists a diver shows in one dive. The number of somersaults and twists as well as the position in which you leave the platform and enter the water add to the degree of difficulty. “You have the tuck position which is like a ball shape and that puts you into a really small position and allows you to spin really fast and that gives you a lower degree of difficulty. But, for example, when you have the pike position, which is more like an L-shape that means you are bigger and longer and it’s harder to spin as fast and that increases the degree of difficulty. And if you start with a handstand, instantly you have a higher degree of difficulty,” explains former cliff diving world champion Joey Zuber.
Improvement and evolution are crucial aspects of the Red Bull Cliff Diving World Series and in the past four years the athletes have been pushing for more difficult and complex dives. In the 2012 season, the average DD for the optional dives performed in a competition is 5.4. However, not everything in cliff diving centres on the degree of difficulty as the quality of the dives plays a major part, and this is where the judges come in. The five international jurors don’t judge based upon how difficult a dive is. They judge it by how well the athletes execute the dive and they have to look at the overall aesthetics of the dive: is it a strong take-off? Is the flight in the air good? Are their legs straight, are the toes pointed? Is the entry nice and vertical? It doesn’t matter whether the dive is ‘easy’ or ‘hard’, they still have to score it based upon how good it looks. The judges have to look at the dive as a performance piece, not just as a technical piece.
Still new to the sport is David Colturi. The 23-year-old American won the 2012 qualification competition and finished his home stop in third place. His diving list contains dives with a DD of 5.4 and 5.6, which is already a lot higher DD than some of the more established divers have in their programmes. The youngest athlete on tour knows that picking the dive is something that depends on one’s personal diving style and what types of manoeuvres one likes to do: “I am a fan of the twist. My favourite dive is a reverse twister and my handstand also has a lot of twists in it. I think with a sport that is extreme and dangerous like cliff diving you kind of pick the ones that you’re comfortable with and the ones you can feel confident going into.”
The recent competitions have proven that the world’s high diving elite feels more and more comfortable with doing big dives from almost three times the Olympic height. Having followed its past development, one next comes to the inevitable question: How difficult can the dives get? “I think the platform is the limit. Not too long ago, we shifted it up to 27.5m from like 24 or 25m, which was the traditional cliff diving limit and soon enough we are going to be using that full 27, 28m to do all the dives you can. I don’t know if there really is a limit. As the sport progresses and the years go on and it gets bigger and more popular, every year I think there going to be bigger and harder dives that come out.
It’s awesome to be a part of it and to push the envelope myself is just an extraordinary feeling,” says David Colturi whose innovative energy everybody may soon have to try and keep up with.
Just like nine-time world champion Orlando Duque, who leads the overall standings going into the final competition and who has influenced this sport so much in the past 20 years. “I don’t think we have reached the limit yet.
