Dual citizenship: Geetha not the only one

House asked to name the others :
Government Minister, JO member, suspected to be among them :
JVP MP Vijitha Herath yesterday asked Parliament to furnish the names of the other members who currently hold dual citizenship.
The MP pointed out that MP Geetha Kumarasinghe was not the only person holding dual citizenship as per the recent comments by Kumarasinghe and Minister Mahinda Amaraweera. “MP Kumarasinghe told the media that she knows of a Government Minister who has citizenship in Switzerland. Minister Amaraweera told the media that another MP in the Joint Opposition holds US citizenship.
The people would like to know who they are.
There cannot be one law to MP Kumarasinghe and another to a Minister. The 19th Amendment to the Constitution is clear that any individual holding dual citizenship is not eligible to enter Parliament. The law should be equal to all. Please reveal these names” he said. Meanwhile, MP Geetha Kumarainsinghe was present in the main chamber yesterday morning. Speaker Karu Jayasuriya informed the House that he has not yet received the Supreme Court ruling in writing, adding that appropriate action would be taken once he receives it.
