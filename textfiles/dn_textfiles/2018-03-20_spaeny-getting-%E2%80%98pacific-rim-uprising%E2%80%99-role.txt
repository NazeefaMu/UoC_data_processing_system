Spaeny on getting ‘Pacific Rim: Uprising’ role

Cailee Spaeny found her passion for performance from singing in church and in a rock band. Each summer, for four years, she and her family would drive for three days from Missouri to
Los Angeles to go on theatrical auditions. The hard work and sacrifice paid off: Spaeny is featured in “Pacific Rim: Uprising,” starring John Boyega and Scott Eastwood.
“It went from zero to 60 very quickly. A month before I booked “Pacific Rim,” I called my agent and asked her to get me a background role in the film. I made a self-tape and I went full out. Agents usually say to stand behind a blank wall, good lighting, close on your face, and not too much movement so it’s not distracting. I didn’t do that at all. I put on a hoodie, was really sweaty, put dirt on my face, threw myself onto the floor. I pushed myself on the ground, had an actual pole in my hand, and hit a pile of pillows like I was attacking someone. I got a call about two weeks later to fly out to meet the director [Steven DeKnight], read with John Boyega and do a chemistry test,” she said on how she landed the project.
She adds, “When I was prepping for the role, I definitely pulled from strong females in film. Amy Adams is such a strong actress but also holds herself very well and is a super kind person. I just worked with Felicity Jones. She treats you like a human being. And of course there’s John Boyega. He didn’t have to take me under his wing. I’ll still message him when I’m nervous.”
