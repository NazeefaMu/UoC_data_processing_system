SLAF Chief attends Hawaii defence confab

Sri Lanka Air Force (SLAF) Commander Air Marshal Kapila Jayampathy attended the Conference of Chiefs of Defence from across the Asia-Pacific region in Honolulu, Hawaii, from September 10-12.
The Asia-Pacific region is host to a range of complex air, maritime, and cyber security challenges. The conference, hosted by the United States Indo-Pacific Command, provides a forum for Chiefs of Defence to work together to find solutions to current and emerging threats. The conference is an annual event, which is held biennially in Hawaii and in a partner country in the region every other year.
