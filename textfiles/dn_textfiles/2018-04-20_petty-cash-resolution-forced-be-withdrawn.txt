Petty cash resolution forced to be withdrawn

Panadura Pradesiya Sabha Chairman Waduge Hemantha Fernando had to withdraw a resolution tabled by him at the first monthly meeting on Tuesday, at the Wadduwa auditorium.
The Panadura PS is controlled by the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna.
Fernando had tabled a resolution to get approval of the members to expend Rs. 1,500 to Rs. 10 lakhs for the administration activities of the PS for 2018, by way of petty cash.
UNP member Thahir Fazi protested against the resolution and was supported by the other councilors leading to Fernando’s having to withdraw the resolution.
UNP member Kanthi Mangalika de Silva addressing the meeting said her brother who contested the local government election from the UNP was defeated, but she had been appointed as a member from the UNP list. In most local government bodies, defeated candidates were appointed as members from the lists of the political parties. This is a very undemocratic way of representing the voters. The government should abolish the present local government election law. All other members addressed the meeting paying tribute to the voters for appointing them to the Panadura Pradeshiya Sabha.
