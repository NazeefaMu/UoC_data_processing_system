Changing global human  resource management practices

In the corporate world, the subject of Human Resource Management has come to stay at the top of the ladder of Business Management supplementing the corporate goals and strong good governance measures. It is the quality and exceptional skills of the staff, workers and the management who jointly possess the keys to corporate Governance and corporate stability of any corporate entity as they will be directly executing the plans, goals, targets and the vision of the Board Of Directors.
All over the world, the high performing top bracket executives usually coordinate with the HR Manager in picking up the best possible team members for the corporate matches in future. One cannot have non-performers and losers in the team. With competition looming large at almost all businesses, corporate management will have to continually search for executives with high innovative skills. Very few businesses are enjoying absolute monopolies. Head Hunting has become an integral part of modern business management. Profitability would be the ultimate goal with any team of staff members.
However, there are other corporate measurements such as corporate standing, customer acceptance, good CSR practices, lower staff turnover levels and a number of other norms to measure the level of corporate success. Major corporate conglomerates even proceed to the extent of spying over the activities of the top executives of rival companies. Some executives pass on core information to rival companies while some others join rival companies after gathering vital and core business secrets of their present companies. Some companies even make reward payments to executives of rival companies for passing on sensitive information to them on a regular basis. This type of practices are common in high tech product and service manufacturing and marketing companies or in companies subject to subtle changes in demand over the sensitiveness of key factors.
Therefore, the appointment of an efficient HR manager is of great importance to the success story of any corporate entity. As it is the vision of any company to recruit and retain a long serving staff cadre, the top management should assist the HR manager in recruiting the most suitable staff members to achieve group results at various levels. HR Manager could be considered as the live wire of any organization who will immediately unearth and remedy the conflicts of staff members within an organization. It is common to find the following types of conflicts within an organization at any time.
 
* Intra individual conflicts within a group
* Inter group conflicts
* Managerial conflicts
These conflicts will come into surface only in specific situations or at times of poor business results of a corporate entity. Finding fault with each other at a later stage will pull the company backwards and will not yield the corporate results expected.
It is up to the directors and top management to strengthen the hands of HR manager at all times. It is common to find the following duties and responsibilities for a HR manager in a conventional corporate entity.
 
* Maintenance of accurate up to date records of all employees in personal files
n Maintaining the secrecy of core details of top managers and executive staff as far as possible which would lead to above conflicts at any time. The secrecy could be established by using special passwords and changing same periodically so that other members of the HR department will not have access to confidential information or by improved technology.
*Ensure the payment of statutory dues to state institutions on due dates pertaining to the Employees and also meeting deadlines for monthly remuneration payments.
* Procuring the progress and performance reports from all departments to assess the needs of job enrichment of every staff member.
* Continuous sourcing of staff through varied recruitment channels and industry reports.
* Introduction of periodic incentive schemes for work groups in consultation with top management and Board Of Directors.
*Arranging high quality training & development programs to enhance the skill and productivity levels of all staff members.
* Invitation of external agencies and plant/machinery suppliers to carry out periodic training programmes for staff members and top management
* Timely and effective communication of all directions, decisions, instructions, guidelines, company policy decisions, work rules/times and work ethics, to ensure strict compliance
 
* Usage of main/departmental notice boards for effective communication, if required
n Ensuring job enrichment measures such as promotion, salary increases, incentives, profit bonus, holiday pay and better working conditions, to retain the high performing and other staff*
Mitigation of staff/management turnovers to minimum levels and also to match the industry statistics.
nInitiation of staff welfare/distress/medical/housing/vehicle and higher education funds covering the employees and their immediate family members depending on levels of internally generated profits and the policy of the company
* Carrying out periodic industry statistics surveys and duly informing the management
* Designing of recruitment, promotion, retrenchment, transfer, dismissal and other situational documentation in a standardized format
n Physical observation of work procedures and target achievements of different departments together with the departmental heads of each department for improvement of productivity and quality and assessment of staff at work stations.
* Ensuring of security and retaining of all files to be in line with the statutory requirements
Let us now consider the impact of external factors on HR practices in a global environment. These factors fall into five major categories.
 
*Economic factors
* Political factors
* Legal factors
n Technological factors
* Cultural factors
Due to above factors emerging from time to time, HRM practices may well vary from entity to entity at both national & international levels. Internationally, the most important factors which can affect HR practices within the organizations are world economic conditions and technological innovations. At national level, economic, legal and political scenarios, cultural and demographic developments are the factors which affect HRM practices. Due to external factors, the traditional and commonly followed HR practices may not be practically possible to implement. The economic woes of a country will have a direct bearing on the labour markets/supply of a country.
This will affect the recruitment and selection practices of a company, later. The per capita income of a country, its labour laws and GDP levels will influence the minimum wage rate. Quoted companies in Sri Lanka have separate remuneration committees and they look into wage/salary structures from time to time and formulate remuneration policies. Political factors are taking precedence in times of elections, political uncertainties or based on election promises.
Globally, contemporary HR related laws are mainly based on prevention of sexual harassment, work safety and health Management, labour union action/contracts, disability and a few more areas. Legal framework decides the application of varied HRM practices through labour and employment laws.
Demographic factors are the attitudes and characteristics of work force such as Gender, literacy level, race, cultural background & level of education. Ratio of men & women in work force and the cultural diversity has its share of bearing on organizational performance, mainly within the organization.
Ethical behavior has now become a central point for the cultural values. As a result, HR practices have been designed with ethical codes of conduct at work place which every employee has to sign and follow. This has become a paramount necessity at work places due to globalization.
The political factors pose immense influences on HRM policies of all companies. Some countries exercise very little influence on the HRM policies of companies. A good example is Hong Kong. On the contrary, Singapore government has been monitoring the HR practices and is continuously monitoring the pay and incentive schemes so that HR personnel have to strictly adhere to the rules and regulations.
In Japanese conglomerates, the findings, research work and connected work results in new productive ideas which will be reviewed and accepted by the other managers after a review by the chief executive officer and the Managing Director, if the results expected are in line with corporate objectives.
Unfortunately, this is not the case in some Sri Lankan Companies. Ideas will be either ignored or set aside or will be presented by another as if the ideas were mooted by him/her.
This will discourage the hard working, loyal and forward thinking staff members/managers. A majority of Sri Lankan executives are often deprived of self-development and job enrichment within their respective companies. In some companies, even the private secretaries ,blue eyed staff members, drivers and peons of directors have considerable clout in companies and could easily carry tales to the directors about the executives. These executives at times work under considerable stress and worry and are not interested in putting their best efforts for the company.
This could be a common problem in Sri Lankan companies where corporate governance measures and work ethics are not fully followed. Even, two private secretaries of two directors or managers could easily upset the apple cart by being selfish and petty minded. The obvious outcome will be the formation of rival groups within the company pursuing their own interests. Personal jealousies will creep in to companies as a result of these differences. This type of scenarios are quite common in family owned companies and where directors are worried about their own job securities.
However, most Japanese companies respect individual brilliance and staff commitments. New ideas are accepted from all corners of a corporate entity. Female staff management is given priority in most Japanese companies due to the connection between female employment, fertility and the countrys population. Japanese Governments often face pressures from western countries for the freedom of Japanese women to decide on their own in matters connected with employment. Japanese also have unique retrenchment policies also by introducing meal/health vouchers to the staff facing temporary retrenchment from the company catering service and the company medical unit.
This is to keep them going until new orders for their products/services have been procured and the order books are restored to the original levels. However, in Sri Lanka staff members are continued to be kept in service for lengthy periods despite loss of orders and continued financial losses. No work study and time study exercises are carried out on staff at any time in most corporate entities taking a cue from the state instituitions. This is the main reason for Japanese companies to exist for decades and decades in a stable platform despite domestic/global economic turbulences.
Society for Human Resource Management is the largest HRM body in the world since its formation in 1948.It has nearly 300,000 members in around 165 countries. This society is the leading provider of resources to serve the needs of HR professionals for the advancement of the professional studies in HRM. Further, the society has around 580 affiliated chapters within the United States and affiliated offices in China, India and United Arab Emirates.
New technology is landscaping the whole HRM function with India taking the top slot. From the 21 century beginning, technology and process automation have been blending and integrating with the HR function. With innovation, companies are now bringing in latest and most appropriate technology to their HRM function. More and more employees are now on the lookout for non monetary benefits such as learning, growth and remote working rather than simply working for one organization for their lifetime.
Despite financial prosperity, corporate entities do not appear to be spending these gains on employees and their job enrichment. This scenario has created frustration and at times the work fatigue coupled with feeling of insecurity.
It would be advisable for company managements to devise new methods for profit sharing with the employees after the profits are realized in cash. A greater majority of workers at all levels are hoping for new openings due to inadequate recognition at their work places. As a result, they are continuously on the lookout for monetary benefits either through genuine or fraudulent means. A corporate entity must understand the human mind dynamics and keep them happy at all times following the concept Good pay/benefits for Good work.
 
Some of the latest trends and facts unearthed internationally are enumerated below for the benefit of all HR personnel in Sri Lanka and abroad.
 
1. The HR function is increasing its strategic role in all forms of work environments. Clear distinctions are emerging between the HR function and the line management in meeting the responsibilities for HRM policy decisions coupled with reliance on technology based systems.
2. The use of part-time work is decreasing while tele-working and shift-work are on the rise
3. Appraisal processes frequently require the input of employees themselves, very often leading to recommendations for future training and career development needs, as well as remuneration decisions.
4. Number of training days are increasing globally with the advent and introduction of e-learning systems and specific requirements of on the job training
5. Some global corporate entities have unique pay systems. The practice of offering employee benefits that exceed statutory requirements is on the decline in a marginal way, except for health care insurance sector
6. Trade union action is likely to rise as global trade patterns and market shares are affected. There could be pressure on remuneration & perks of executives and directors due to this factor.
7. Downward communication is mostly taking place through electronic means while the upward communication takes place commonly through supervisors
8. References go a long way in the recruitment of middle managers and staff at lower levels. Past experience, performances, remuneration/benefits, achievements and corporate standing will be the considerations for top executives
9. GDP levels and per capita income of the country will also determine the remuneration levels
10. Some corporate entities have resorted to the methods of combined remuneration in the form of salaries, statutory benefits,work/profit and incentives in a combined package forcing the employees to work for profit targets of the company.

 
In conclusion, it should be stressed that a large number of Sri Lankan entities do not meet the statutory payments to the employees and somehow evade action of state labour authorities. Some employers confirm the employment status of the employees only after 12 months and they somehow get rid of the employees at any level of employment before the completion of the said 12 months. The state labour authorities should visit all registered companies, partnerships and sole trader businesses on a quarterly basis at least, to remedy the situation.
