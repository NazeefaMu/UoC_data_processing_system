Mertens nets double as Napoli upset Roma

ROME, Saturday - Dries Mertens scored twice as third-placed Napoli upset AS Roma 2-1 away on Saturday and moved to within two points of them in the Serie A standings.
Mertens was set up for the opening goal by Marek Hamsik with a clever through ball but still needed to beat the offside trap and two defenders before chipping cleverly over Roma goalkeeper Wojciech Szczesny in the 25th minute.
The Belgian international added a second five minutes into the second half, touching in a cross from the left by Lorenzo Insigne. But Napoli had to survive an anxious final five minutes after Kevin Strootman pulled a goal back in the 89th minute and Mohamed Salah, who had hit the upright, and Diego Perotti came close to a stoppage-time equaliser with Napoli's Pepe Reina pulling off a dramatic save to ensure the points.
Napoli are now back in contention for an automatic Champions League berth next season as they moved on to 57 points. Second- placed Roma have 59, seven behind leaders Juventus who play at Udinese on Sunday. – Agencies
