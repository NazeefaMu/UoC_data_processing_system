Call of love

Shooting that particular scene was difficult. This movie project was an ambitious one and had too many hurdles to overcome. First, it was the location. The film had to be shot at the National Institute of Mental Health. No inmate could be noticed in a single scene. Even if they give their consent, it will not be deemed suitable, given their mental condition.
The solution? Casting a new group of inmates.
But then again, the issue of doing cinematic justice to the real life phenomenon loomed large. Vindana Ariyawansa and Kalpana Ariyawansa had to overcome several such challenges in producing their creative debut, ‘Premaya Nam’.
The chosen cast had to visit the institute several times in order to study the inmates’ behaviour. The stories learnt, behaviour closely studied, and finally, the cast was ready to breathe life into the crux of the film. It narrates a tale about a man who suffered from a mental condition called Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (OCD), one of the four commonest mental disorders found among the human species on this planet. A person suffering from this condition is burdened by obsessive thoughts which result in compulsive behaviours.

It affects men, women and children and can develop at any age, according to a general description online. Some people develop the condition early, often around puberty, but it typically develops during early adulthood. OCD can be distressing and significantly interfere with your life, but treatment can help you keep it under control.
Shooting the scenes without inmates was successful to some extent.
“There was one elderly person. He was full of fun. Whenever we say action, this grandpa somehow poses to the camera from distance. That is the blurred image you see.”
The grandfather’s entrance has even instigated a note in the IMDB as a goof.
After relieving himself, Vishva, the lead character, cannot help but go for a shower. He is constantly troubled by the thought that the liquid has contaminated his body and clothes. Throughout the film (except for the last scene), Vishva keeps his hands above the waistline. Slow but steadily, this phenomenon takes a heavy toll on his life. His wife leaves him to his own devices. His boss forces him to quit his white collar job. His parents told off by his parents in law. Finally he visits the hospital himself in search of a remedy. But medicine disillusions him. He is left without an option, until he finds the only option left.
Before the credits appear on the film, the audience is warned: the film is based on a true story. And that true story belongs to Vindana Ariyawansa. It could be perhaps for the first time that a person who suffered from a mental disorder had the guts to film his own story. But Vindana chose not to perform his own character.
“You never feel bad for a fat guy. That’s why I did not act. But I worked with Shyam to sharpen the sense of authenticity. Sometimes I acted out certain scenes myself to show him the actual me,” Vindana explained.

Ariyawansas’ first challenge was to destigmatise the stigma created around mental disorders.
“Except for the final scene, everything including dialogues happened just the same way in my life,” Vindana states.
It is not the medications that helped him overcome the condition. Medications can serve only 15 percent, and the rest is up to the person. You should have a defence mechanism to fight the condition. What was Vishva’s defence mechanism? It is none other than the much-adored L word: Love. Pushed by that powerful emotion, Vishva succeeds in building up his defence mechanism to overcome his mental condition.
‘My father suggested making a film based on my idiosyncratic behaviour. He strongly believed that it will generate some interest in people.’
And Kularatne Ariyawansa was just right. Beginning from the Beijing Film Festival, the film shot to stardom in Hollywood, to the much surprise of Ariyawansa brothers.
‘In Sri Lanka, of course, we can expect this film to be a trendsetter. But we were surprised to find interest shown for this film in places where there is a good awareness about mental illnesses.’
Vindana has left no stone unturned in his life story to make this film. Even though most films are ‘based on true story’ they usually extract the influence and add much imagination. On the contrary, Vindana was privileged with full liberty to convert his story, in almost entirety, into a motion picture.
The final scene was changed deliberately as Ariyawansa brothers believed in hope for humanity.
“People are anyway plagued with quite a lot of burdens in life. We should not overburden them in a film. That is why we decided on a reunion for the final scene. It will inspire people to react positively to any kind of mental disorder,” Vindana keeps fingers crossed.
They had a lot of facts to ponder. The plot is based on a personal love story, for one. And they needed to syringe authenticity into the plot as much as possible. The theme is a new concept to the contemporary spectacle.
“Unlike physical ailments, the mental sicknesses are not visible. We have so many mental disorders. Most such disorders lie deep beneath without affecting our lifestyle. The problem is when they surface and affect our lifestyle,” Vindana explained.
Medicine could not offer a proper cure to Vishva’s mental disorder. The cure came from within. That is where Vindana rests his hope – for he believes love has the power to cure.
In real love, Vindana believes that sacrifice is much easier. You cannot complain about all the things you have done when the other party falters in returning your love. He cites Alexander Pushkin to define – or redefine, perhaps - love.
I loved you once: perhaps that love has yet
To die down thoroughly within my soul;
But let it not dismay you any longer;
I have no wish to cause you any sorrow.
I loved you wordlessly, without a hope,
By shyness tortured, or by jealousy.
I loved you with such tenderness and candour
And pray God grants you to be loved that way again.
In such kind of love, you do not feel pained anymore. Premaya Nam bursts with inspiration to encourage such kind of love.
