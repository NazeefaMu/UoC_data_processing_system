Harispattuwa PS Chair gives ‘15-minute’ pledge

People who come to Harispattuwa Pradeshiya Sabha to obtain various services will be able to meet their requirements in 15 minutes, said Harispattuwa Pradeshiya Sabha Chairman Ananda Jayawilal.
He was addressing the gathering after assuming duties at the Pradeshiya Sabha office in Tittapajjala, recently.
“Even though we are of the SLPP, we will serve all without any discrimination of party, class, ethnicity or religion,” he said.
He added that his support will be provided to UNP, JVP and other party councillors to carry out their work to serve the people of the area. Chairman Ananda Jayawilal said there will be no room for anyone to neglect their work or exploit their position in the PS.
