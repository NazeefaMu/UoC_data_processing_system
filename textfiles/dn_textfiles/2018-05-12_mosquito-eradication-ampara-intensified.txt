Mosquito eradication in Ampara intensified

The mosquito eradication programme in the Ampara District Coastal areas had been intensified. Awareness programmes are being conducted throughout the district.
Immediately after the rains, low-lying areas along the coastal belt were inundated which became good breading grounds for mosquitoes.
Programmes are being carried out at Divisional Secretariat level. Health Department officials are visiting households at Grama Niladhari Division level to check for mosquito breeding places and advise residents on how to destroy mosquito breeding sites.
The programmes are in progress in state and private institutes as well, including schools and work palaces. The support of the security personnel, including members of the Police and Civil Security Force, Public Health Inspectors, Family Health officials and members of the public are sought in the dengue eradication programme.
Akkaraipattu Zonal Education Director A. M. Rahmathullah had instructed school Principals to draw special attention to the cleanliness of the school environment aiming to curtail the spread of dengue.
Principals were further advised to free the school environment of junk and mosquito breeding grounds with the assistance of SDC officials, parents, staff, and past and present pupils.
The public are advised to dispose their garbage properly and keep the sewages clean. “Health Department officers alone cannot eradicate dengue mosquitoes. The public should also extend their cooperation in this task,” Health Department officials said.
