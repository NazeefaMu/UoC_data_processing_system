EC to register differently-abled persons

The Election Commission(EC)is to take measures to register differently-abled persons to make it easier for them to vote, Election Commission Chairman Mahinda Deshapriya said.
“There are close to two million people differently-abled in Sri Lanka,” he said. Chairman of the Elections Commission Deshapriya observed that differently-abled persons face many challenges when exercising their franchise.
“At times, they have difficulties in saying their name, they are blind or they do not have access to the polling station. These issues can be solved when we have a register of them and we know what facilities need to be given,” Deshapriya said addressing a media briefing at the Elections Secretariat.
“The differently-abled once registered will be given special IDs to make it easier for them to be identified as needing special attention by the election officers,” he said.
“This is a group which is often ignored in this country and hopefully these interventions will help them take part in our democracy,” the Chairman said.
