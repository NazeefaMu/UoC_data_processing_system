Singer Sri Lanka Marketing Director Kumar Samarasinghe was very enthusiastic on their venture with MCA and told that he is delighted to be a part of MCA for a long time as a player, a committee member and now a main sponsor.
“Singe always believe in promoting cricket in Sri Lanka and we are thoroughly involved in fostering school cricket being the main sponsor for the biggest annual school tournament which includes 6900 matches. Many National cricketers who played for the country have either played for MCA or took part in MCA tournaments. So we hope to strenghten our ties with MCA in developing Sri Lankan cricket,” he revealed.
