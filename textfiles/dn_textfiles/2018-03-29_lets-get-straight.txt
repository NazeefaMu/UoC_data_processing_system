Let's get this straight...

One of the solutions to a perfect, problem-free hair would be to go in for straightening. This gives you the added advantage of letting your hair fall straight, effortlessly, hardly ever knotting up. Be it thick, curly or frizzy hair, going for the poker straight look has been the answer to many hair woes for decades. Not only do you get to flaunt straight and manageable locks but it also promises silky, shiny, and sleek hair.
 
 Meaning of rebonding hair 
Rebonding is a chemical hair treatment that makes your hair straight, sleek and shiny. It is a permanent procedure
Each type of hair has a natural bond. Curly or wavy, are the results of natural bonds that give the hair its physical quality. The cream softener or relaxant used in the rebonding treatment breaks the hair structure. Then a neutraliser bonds the structure again and makes hair straight.
 
Why you should rebond your hair 
If you have curly, frizzy, or unmanageable hair, you may have opted to have your hair straightened permanently. Straightening hair is increasingly common among women today.
 
Hair rebonding process 
First the hair is washed with a mild shampoo. Conditioner is not applied. It is then left to dry naturally or is blow dried.
Then the stylist divides the hair into sections depending on the texture and volume. A relaxant from the hair bonding kit is applied while the hair is held straight with the help of thin plastic boards. The stylist takes care to apply the relaxant so that it coats every strand.
The relaxant is then left on for 30 to 45 minutes depending on the texture of the hair. Next the stylist proceeds to wash and dry the hair.
The hair is straightened with a flat iron. A ceramic flat iron is used to do this. A neutralizer is applied to secure the bonds and left on for 30 minutes. It is then rinsed out with cold water. Lastly the hair is blowdried.
 
Time
Hair rebonding is an elaborate process that incorporates the use of chemicals and heat to alter the structure of your hair. Depending on the length of your hair, the treatment can take from three to eight hours.
 
Colouring and rebondingat the same time 
Wait for at least two weeks to colour your hair after a hair straightening treatment. You should wait at least two weeks to give your hair a chance to stabilize in its new straighter shape before colouring.
 
Difference between hair straightening and hair rebonding 
Hair straightening can be classified in different categories such as chemical hair straightening, thermal hair straightening, hair straightening through hot irons, using hair serums, etc. Whatever the process selected, the hair stylist uses the method only on a small section of hair at a time and then repeats it on the whole length of hair.
Rebonding is one of the special techniques of hair straightening that has the potential to transform the looks of a person if she has curly hair and desires to have straight hair like many Caucasians. As the name implies, the chemical bonds in hair follicles are broken and rearranged to make hair straight. In rebonding, hair straightening is achieved using strong chemicals. These chemicals go inside the inner layers of hairs and alter the structure to make them straight on a permanent basis until the new hair re-grows.
 
Side effects of hair rebonding 
After rebonding, your hair requires utmost care and maintenance since it becomes fragile after the treatment.
Regular touch ups need to be done to maintain the texture and quality of the hair after the procedure. Since it is a permanent procedure, the effects are long lasting and there is no turning back to your natural hair once it is done.
 
Washing hair after rebonding 
 
Do not wet your hair for three days after the procedure. You can then wash your hair with shampoo and conditioner. Leave the conditioner on your hair for a few extra minutes. Also, ensure you condition your hair every time you shampoo it.
 
Lasting period 
 
If done correctly the rebonding can last for about six to seven months. However, once your hair is straightened you have to touch up the new growth every three months, six months or a year, depending on your growth.
