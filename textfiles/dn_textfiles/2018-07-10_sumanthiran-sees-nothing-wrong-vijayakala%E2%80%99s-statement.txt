Sumanthiran sees nothing wrong with Vijayakala’s statement

Tamil National Alliance (TNA) Parliamentarian M.A.Sumanthiran yesterday said he does not find any wrong with Vijayakala Maheshwaran’s statement regarding the LTTE.
He said that the Tamil people will accept a solution on the proposals made by the previous government.
“These proposals were made by the previous regime and not by us,” he said.
“These proposals were made when the LTTE was in operation. If the present government says they will not bring a solution on these proposals, as LTTE is no more in existence, that is wrong,” Sumanthiran said.
“It means that the government is ready to find a solution, only if the LTTE is still in existence”, he said MP Sumanthiran was addressing an event at Karawanella in Magammana.
