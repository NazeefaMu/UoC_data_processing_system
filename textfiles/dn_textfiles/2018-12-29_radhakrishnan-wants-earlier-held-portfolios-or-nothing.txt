Radhakrishnan wants earlier held portfolios or nothing

Former Education State Minister, Nuwara Eliya Parliamentarian Velusami Radhakrishnan said that he would not accept a portfolio from the government if he cannot serve the public through it.
He was speaking to the media yesterday in Nuwara Eliya.
He said his party, the Up-Country People's Front (UCPF), supported the United National Party (UNP) in the political unrest on October 26 and thereafter.
“Now a new government has been set up and two Cabinet Ministers should be given to his party. Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe promised our Badulla District MP Aravind Kumar that he (PM) would appoint a Cabinet Minister and a Deputy Minister from our party when the new government was formed. Now the Cabinet comprises 30 ministers. We asked the government in writing to grant me my earlier portfolio and its Deputy Minister Post to Aravind Kumar, the former Minister said.
“The Prime Minister promised us that he will give us what we asked for and we agreed. Now we came to know that I would be given a new portfolio and that the Deputy Minister post is not even in the list,” he said.
“If it is the situation, we will not accept any portfolio. But we do not join the opposition on this issue. We will support the UNP further. I do not want to accept a ministerial portfolio through which I cannot serve the public,” the former Minister said.
He said that he believed that the Prime Minister would not discard his promises. “We do not need any portfolio other than the ones we asked for,” he said.
