New tunnel from Getambe to Tennekumbura: Answer to Kandy traffic congestion

A new tunnel will be constructed from Getambe to Tennekumbura to ease traffic congestion in Kandy, said Leader of the House and Higher Education and Highways Minister Lakshman Kiriella.
“Past rulers never gave highway contracts to domestic companies. This is the first time that a domestic company has been awarded a highway construction contract,” he said.
Kiriella said when he was the Kandy district chief organiser in 1989, he received requests regarding the Halloluwa Bridge.
“The first foundation stone to build this bridge was laid by Deputy Minister Hemachandra Sirisena during the 1960-65 Sri Lanka Freedom Party government rule. But construction came to a halt over the years,” he said.
The minister made these comments at the opening ceremony of the new Dodamwala and Halloluwa Bridge. It was built over the Mahaweli River by the Road Development Authority under the UK Steel Bridge Project.
The 105 metre bridge was built at a cost of Rs. 374 million.
“The unity government has commenced many projects in Kandy. Construction from Kadawatha to Meerigama for the Central Expressway has begun, and the section from Meerigama to Kurunegala has been awarded to a local contractor for the first time in history,” Kirella said.
President Maithripala Sirisena, Post, Postal Services and Muslim Religious Affairs Minister M.H.A. Haleem, British High Commissioner to Sri Lanka James Dauris, MPs Mayantha Dissanayaka, Lucky Jayawardana, Ananda Aluthgamage, provincial ministers and residents participated.
