Forget petty differences, join help affected people: MR

Former President Mahinda Rajapaksa yesterday appealed to people to forget petty differences and come forward to help the people affected by floods and landslides in eight districts.
Speaking to journalists in Colombo, Rajapaksa said he was pleased to see relief measures being carried out led by religious leaders of all faiths.
He said religious sites in affected areas have become centres in carrying out relief activities. He said it would help build unity among different religious and ethnic groups in a time of calamity.
The former President charged that the government had been once again caught ill-prepared to handle a natural disaster of this magnitude.
He said the government had not learned from the similar disasters in the past and their failure to put in place a strong mechanism to face such calamities was once again exposed.
