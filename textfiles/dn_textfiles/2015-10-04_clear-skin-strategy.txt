Clear skin strategy

In today’s ‘Beauty Talk’ Hasini Gunasekera shares her top beauty tips on how to keep your skin spotless and blemish-free.
Q: What is pigmentation?
A: Dark spots, age spots, sun spots whatever it is called it is pigmentation.
Uneven complexion mostly dark brown patches seen around the cheeks, face and sometimes even around the shoulders are called pigmentation.
Ageing dark spots caused by sun exposure (and specifically the UVA rays which penetrate deep into your skin and cause ageing) are also known as pigmentation. UVA stimulates your pigment cells called Melanocytes to manufacture the pigment called Melanin. This is responsible for your tan and also your unwanted dark patches. This is not an immediate reaction, rather shows after a few years of sun exposure. Pigmentation in young women also may be due to pregnancy which alters hormone levels.
You can prevent future pigmentation and sun damage by wearing a UVA and UVB shielding sunscreen and feeding your face with antioxidants (primarily fruits and veggies).
 
Q: Is there a home remedy to get rid of it?

A: Potatoes:
It is a good source to prevent a range of skin pigmentation problems such as melasma, dark circles, hyper and hypo pigmentation. As potatoes can lighten the skin with continuous application, slice or grate a potato and squeeze the juice of medium size potato and rub it on the skin pigmentation area or leave it applied for half an hour. And rinse with water. Doing it regularly will have a noticeable difference.
Lemon and Cucumber
These two are also a great skin lightening agents. So applying a few drops of lemon and cucumber juice every day on affected area will give you desired results. To get best result apply twice a day, morning and evening. Leave for 20 minutes and wash it off your with water.
 
Q: What should be the best criteria to select sunscreen?

A: A sun screen at least must contain the following two features;
SPF 15 or higher for UVB protection: The SPF factor rates how effective the sunscreen is in preventing sunburn caused by UVB rays. If you'd normally burn in 10 minutes, SPF 15 multiplies that by a factor of 15, meaning you could go 150 minutes before burning.Water and sweat resistance: If you're going to be exercising or in the water, it's best to get a sunscreen resistant to water and sweat.
 
Q: Will applying sunscreen on acne skin worsen the condition

A: In short, yes it’s possible to worsen your acne condition, but it really depends on the type of sun screen you’re applying to your skin. Look for not oil-free, but non-comedogenic sun screens which means that the product is designed not to clog your pores and then cause further irritation, pimples, and blemishes.
 
Q: How to get rid of dark skin on your neck? A home remedy?

A: Many people suffer the embarrassment of having dark skin patches around their neck. This is a fairly common skin pigmentation disorder mainly caused due to aging and sun exposure. Other causes are diabetes, genetics, polycystic ovary syndrome, poor hygiene, and sudden weight loss or weight gain.
Make a thick paste of powdered almonds, milk powder and honey, leave it on skin for half hour and wash it clean. Best to apply it twice or thrice a week.
 
Q: If you have acne/ problem skin what food should be avoided?

A: Cut back on pasta, white rice, white bread, and sugar also avoiding hormone-laden dairy products, meats, chocolate, french fries, and other junk foods.
 
Q: What food should be consumed by acne prone people? Please name.

A: Food is only about 25% of the picture when it comes to acne, The other 75% is influenced by hormones, stress, sleep levels, and good skin care also plays a role such as exercise and drinking enough water. A balanced diet is also extremely important.
 
Q: What is the best time of the day to eat fruits? There’s a recently emerged medical view that fruits should not be eaten soon after meals? What is your view as a beautician?

A: Fruit should be eaten alone or with other fruit on an empty stomach.
This is because when fruit is eaten, the digestive process works very quickly and our body uses different enzymes to digest the fruit. The simple sugars contained in fruit need time to be completely absorbed by your body. When fruits are eaten alone, your stomach can more easily process all of the nutrients, fibre and the simple sugars contained in the fruit. This is the best way to benefit from the fruit you eat.
 
Q: A beauty tip for this week please?

A: Have a fresh tomato a day to maintain beautiful and youthful skin.
Tomatoes are filled with riches when it comes to their antioxidant benefits. Tomatoes provide an excellent amount of vitamin C and beta-carotene; a very good amount of the mineral manganese and a good amount of vitamin E.
