Those wishing to build new parties should leave SLFP: President

President Maithripala Sirisena said it is amusing to see members who say they have not obtained membership of the new party in media discussions, asking the public to vote for another party and not the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP).
He requested the public to engage in politics according to their conscience.
The President made these remarks addressing a political meeting held in support of SLFP candidates contesting the upcoming Local Government elections at Homagama, on Sunday afternoon.
President Sirisena said the secretary and the president of the newly-established party are former SLFP ministers, as well as ones who held key positions in the former government.
He added that those who claim that they cannot operate without the photographs of the late Prime Ministers (Bandaranaike’s), are the ones who advise to change the policies of the Central Committee of the SLFP which was introduced by the Bandaranaike’s.
He said he would take further steps to reveal to the country those responsible and punish them for past frauds and corruptions.
Minister Susil Peajayantha, State Minister A. H. M. Fauzie, Deputy Speaker Thilanga Sumathipala, Western Province Chief Minister Isura Devapriya, SLFP Homagma Provincial Councilors Gamini Thilakasiri and Weerakumara Dissanayake, and former Kotte Mayor Janaka Ranwaka, were among the gathering.
