Once Upon a long time ago…

 A young man was born ages ago, in a time of spiritual darkness (abuddhassa), with no Teacher (sammasambuddha), to point the way out of the cycle of life and death (samsara), which only brought sorrow, to all sentient beings.
He had felt his mind vibrate, seeking release out of this trap. For countless births, he had practised sense discipline and mind-control, and intuitively felt that now, the goal was within his grasp. So he left home and family and sat in deep meditation out in the forest, exploring with his inner eye, the cosmos and the far reaches of the universe.
His mind travelled through Island Universes, spanning incalculable distances, sensing the minutest details of samsara, namely the Dance of Life and Death, and again Life, and again Death, and so on, in a ceaseless cycle.
Happiness, Unhappiness and Decay, came between these two major events. Everywhere his mind went, he was attracted and perturbed by what he sensed and saw. Many hours were spent in incessantly going forth and coming back to his inert body, sitting under a tree.
He visited various star systems, pausing here and there to examine the worlds of strange sentient beings trapped in samsara, all suffering from ease and dis-ease. The governing forces that kept them in bondage were Greed, Impermanence and the Ego.
Eventually, his wandering mind settled down gently in his body. Realisation came that samsara, in its many facets existed right here, within his own self, in the tandem which was his body and mind, the psycho-soma. Ideas that were tenuously coagulated.
He inhaled and exhaled slowly and lightly.
Comprehension arose as to the complex nature of samsara, the constant interchange between life and death. Sometimes Life lasted only for a few minutes or stretched to days, months, years or even to aeons, but always ended in Death, to start the cycle again. Happiness in this phenomenal state was eclipsed by lamentation and despair, suffered by all living beings. Sansara was always in a condition of flux. Attachment to phenomena, therefore brought only suffering to both the mind and the body.
He still sat in meditation.
Knowledge and wisdom arose in him. Serenity pervaded his mind. The highest enlightenment (sambodhi), was achieved. He knew that the release of his mind from all defilements will not be disturbed (akkupa me chetovimuktti), by any condition.
Nirvana, the non-phenomenal state of mind was attained. He was free both from happiness, and unhappiness. There would never be a rebirth for him in this sorrowful samsara!
His aspect was passionless. Around him, a halo radiated in ever widening circles, bright and clear, which no one other than he could see, because, though he was released from all suffering, he could never teach the Path to Nirvana, as he was not a Sammasambuddha. In this time of Abuddhassa, he was a Silent Buddha, able only to help himself.
He teleported to Isigili Mountain and vanished into it, never to come out again, thus becoming one of the 500 Silent Buddhas, enumerated by Gautama Sammasambuddha, ages later, in the Isigili Sutta.
