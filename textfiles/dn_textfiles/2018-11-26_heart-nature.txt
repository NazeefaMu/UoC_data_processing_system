Heart with nature

If you want a child to learn about discipline, teach him/her the pleasure of maintaining a good home garden. If you want to teach him/her what satisfaction is, then let that child experience the pleasure of maintaining a good home garden. If you want that child to have a balanced personality then make sure he/she interacts with nature.
Green Thumbs speaks to Deputy Provincial Director of Agriculture Office Ratmalana, District Agriculture Instructor K.N.K. Jayathilake on the principles of maintaining a beautiful home garden.
The success of your home garden depends a lot on the ability to understand something immediately, without the need for conscious reasoning. If you want to make your home garden sustainable there are some recognized principles. The first principle is combining imagination with order.
First impressions mean a lot in the society we live in. The state of your garden tells an outsider a lot about you. For example if you want to ingratiate yourself with your boss then you might like to invite him over to your house for dinner. While walking into your house if he is instantaneously attracted to your garden, then the opinion he forms about you is very positive. Or maybe you want to start a relationship with someone, then having an attractive home garden should be on top of your list of priorities. If that person walks into your house and is instantaneously attracted to your home garden then the impression you give that person is that you are an individual with an orderly lifestyle, who is efficient and responsible. On the other hand if your garden is disorderly then the impression you give to an outsider is that you are lazy, untidy and you cannot overcome your sloth.
“So the first principle is that there has to be some order in your garden, some unity. You need to identify in your home garden how the plants, trees, pathways, arches need to be organized. Maybe there should be matching flower beds on both sides of the pathway, and maybe an arch or two should be above the pathway. Plants with colorful flowers in the sunshine are so beautiful to look at. You can even use various statues in your garden depending on your preference,” stated Jayathilake
Maybe there should be a pond with the sunlight falling directly upon it creating that shimmering effect. Perhaps you can also introduce palms which are so beautiful in a garden. Maybe you can position them in a row or on both sides of the path. Just use your imagination and do not overdo it. Stick to simplicity. You can even have some palms near the pond. You can even include a fountain with water moving. The movement of water has a soothing effect. Ultimately the success of your garden depends on the feedback you get, so do not be afraid to learn when you are criticized about your garden.
“Also, depending on the colors you have, you can position flower beds of the same color in parallel to each other, or position flower beds of different colors in parallel to each other depending on your taste. There needs to be harmony in a way that pleases the eye. There needs to be a certain order. There needs to be patterns. You need to use your intuition when it comes to shape and sizes. Plants of the same size, height and color can be grown along borders,” said Jayathilake
It is quite possible that like art, the knack for gardening maybe inborn. But you can also learn how to be a good gardener. Also there needs to be a sense of proportion.
“Small plants for larger buildings are not suitable. The features need to be in proportion to the architecture of the surrounding buildings. Big plants for larger buildings are suitable. The more variety you have when it comes to colorful plants, the greater your enjoyment. But remember the garden needs to be maintained. The grass needs to be cut, the trees need to be pruned and the weeds have to be pulled out. Again there needs to be symmetry,” added Jayathilake.
You need to be mindful of soil erosion when you are living near a slope. Also sunlight is important- how long does it fall and where does it fall? When dealing with the Symmetry factor you need to position the plants and pathways in places that the sunlight falls. Sun loving plants need to be positioned at places sunlight falls, while being in proportion to the architecture.
You of course need to be a little practical and you can’t grow as many plants as you want. After all you are living in Colombo with limited space and you can’t grow plants like the Hanging Garden of Babylon. Too much of anything is not a good thing.
“The soil condition must be taken into account. Is the soil fertile? Is it sandy soil? Is it clay soil or gravelly soil? A good drainage system is important and irrigation is important. When rain water is not sufficient we need to apply water externally to the crops and this is called irrigation. And getting rid of excess water can be termed drainage. When irrigating there are certain factors to be considered such as the crop type, cropping system, land pattern, soil type and climatic factors such as the Environmental temperature, Relative Humidity (moisture content in the atmosphere) & Wind Speed. The direction of the wind is also of great importance. Strong wind can be harmful to the smaller plants. So trees can be used as barriers that can reduce the strength of the wind and protect smaller plants. If the wind is too strong Perennial trees must be grown or fruit trees can be grown. The trees must be strong. You also need to be mindful as to how much compost or organic manure needs to be used. Organic Manure consists of Compost, Cow dung and poultry litter,” explained Jayathilake.
Also even seeing attractive birds in your garden adds to the pleasure of maintaining a beautiful home garden. Birds of different colors add value to your garden in way that water fountains and statues can’t.
“Sound pollution, dust and traffic fumes from cars can be a problem if you are living near a road. Trees can act as a defense against these problems. An advantage to using plants as noise blockers is that they absorb sounds best in the high frequencies that people find most annoying,” added Jayathilake.
