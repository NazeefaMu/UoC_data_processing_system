Article 3/2016 ...Respect and the Code…all for one!

Aloha and warm greetings to all those who still believe and are aggressive about their club succeeding, despite the state of our island economy and those decision makers, whom I rather think are avid followers of the code....
The game embraces us all, captures the imagination... demands specific management and new skill development for players and fans alike ... especially with the first timers, stepping up to the league.
It is pretty much a dream come true for these lads, just out from a fully loaded school season and hoping to hit the ground running .Expectations and anticipation pouring out of their years - as they try to match up to coach and club demands.
The pressure of the club league ...miles apart from the level and playing environment they are used to......settling down early is key to consistency and performance...Kevin Dixon, Omalka G, and T Ratwatte, Rehan Silva, Ashok Wijeykumar and Chatura Dilshan, good examples of the step up required to survive with those impact professionals, the requirement a lot more mental than physical, as they discover how best to survive on the club circuit.
Internationally the game is absolutely huge and quite relentless, the punishing season pretty much a global phenomenon. The mind wanders joyously around the Aviva premiership in England and the French reflection, its popularity defined by the fans packing the weekend matches. The game on both sides of the English channel decidedly in very good and sensible hands, has long been a shining example of pride and vision.
The story on the southern hemisphere platform is more impressive, Super Rugby carries remarkable pulling power and has set the pace for mega franchise rugby on a scale never experienced before. The modern format and live television has transformed the game for ever....giving fans the opportunity to support the growth and world status as the fastest growing sports discipline across both hemispheres.
The International Rugby Board ,,,certainly enjoying spectacular success, on many surprising levels...take the post World Cup frenzy for numbers and profit, they broke all records and redefined the level of corporate thinking. The Rugby World Club was a showcase tournament and epitomized the strength and vision of this great game....culminating quite neatly with the Olympic family’s newest member ...Rugby 7s - and a roaring success of mega proportion, beautifully defined by Fiji winning the gold and stamping their 7s class across the continents.
The game and its code is policed and safe guarded by its laws ...but among us players, young and old ...there is a strict code of conduct and pleasing amounts of respect that epitomize the game and its fundamental principles.
As players we are nourished and nurtured on this respect from the time we learn to walk and pick up the odd shaped ball.....from hesitant steps as keen youngsters, to strong marauding warriors with big hearts that drive on pride and super human levels of performance fitness – Nadolo, the larger than life Fijian captain who carries his 125kg with much momentum, and the New Zealand winger 110kg Savea’s impact finishing that intimidate all defenders to their core.
respect is the unwritten code that controls us individually and empowers the referee in the middle for the duration of both halves...Respect is our universal language of rugby, that ensures player safety in the air, in the sets, at the bottom of a ruck, flying down the blind side or as we dive full length to score over the line.
I believe that the players ability to function efficiently on controlled aggression is a stark and telling legacy of this remarkable game and the code of respect that governs us all…both on and off the pitch.
At home the Dialog league is just gaining speed and defining itself ...as team combinations sort themselves and fitness starts to bite in the last quarter especially. I am delighted to see the lads who played sevens, dominating with ball in hand and showing the value of extreme conditioning. National skipper Danushka Ranjan, Tarinda Ratwatte, Dulaj Perera, Richard Dharmapala, Kanchana Ramanayake, Sooriyabandara...exceptional skills combined with fitness, make each of them lethal finishers with ball in hand - little wonder that Ranjan 4 tries, is replaced by Dharmapala 5 tries as the top scorer…both Kandy players, specialists in every sense of the word and telling reputations not just here in Sri, but even more compelling Asiawide.
The league is just warming up and I do believe that the remaining matches will be as intense and aggressive as everyone imagines ...Havelocks currently leading the table on 23, and Navy just behind on 22, Kandy settling down on 19, CR looking for better form on 12 and the resurgent Air Force on 10, Army on 8.....with Police and CH still to get a point.
All this will turn and twist and change dramatically in the coming festive weeks...ignore the December chill as we wake and marvel at the heat in the pack as the biggest contenders confront each other in the middle.
Kandy certainly have some work to do ...and will definitely be the team to beat in the second round, both Navy and Havelocks will need all their petrol to secure those two slots at the top .
We get to lick our lips at the mouth watering prospects of seeing the best warriors run out against each other, over the month of December ...and what an X’mas it promises to be. I am hopeful that each club will make these big blockbuster matches, special occasions for fans and family to enjoy ...watch the absorbing impact action and skills in the middle , then the music, lights, entertainment plus, plus ...bring back those classic socials that made each club an oasis of colour and life each weekend.
Finally before I pack my pencil...a pleasant task of wishing an ardent and enthusiastic ‘rugby heart’ Saabir Cader a safe step up to the goal line, as he gets married on Friday... and introduces his blushing bride to the game he has been living with for many seasons ...I trust his stag will be unique and less kit with all the traditional dancers ...clad in a few smiles!
Enjoy the step up islanders and try to predict your match ups. Cheers!
