Inefficient SLFP electoral organizers will be replaced by educated youths: Amaraweera

All inefficient and ineffective SLFP electoral organizers will be removed and replaced with a group of educated and intelligent youths with unblemished character. The party is fully geared to make this change, said Fisheries and Aquatic Resources Development Minister and UPFA General Secretary Mahinda Amaraweera.
Addressing an SLFP district seminar held at Embilipitiya, Amaraweera said it was common knowledge that former President Mahinda Rajapaksa called a Presidential election two years ahead of schedule. At that election, they supported Mahinda Rajapaksa as he was chairman of the SLFP. Amaraweera said he secured the biggest number of preferential votes for Rajapaksa from his electorate.
Thereafter, victorious President Maithripala Sirisena took over the SLFP mantle and requested him to join his government. They did so in keeping with a decision taken by the party central committee, he said.
He added that at the General Elections which followed, the UNP gained the majority number of 106 to the SLFP’s 92. When President Sirisena requested them to join a national government with the UNP, they did so in response to his request, the minister said. His supporters in his electorate too endorsed this move as the UNP had already begun to harass SLFPers as in 1978. Another motive behind their decision to join a national government was to protect SLFP supporters from harassment, Minister Amaraweera said. If they did not join the national government, the UNP would have formed a government with the support of the TNA or some of the members of the Joint Opposition, he said.
Some of those in the joint opposition now lambasting the government had already started hush-hush talks with UNP delegates to join the government by meeting them at night, he added.
He said apart from protecting party supporters, their decision to join the National Government had helped to achieve many victories for the people. “At that time there was immense pressure exerted on Sri Lanka by the UNHRC on the human rights front. There was also the threat of sending some people to the electric chair and then the question of appointing a tribunal with foreign judges, the European ban on fish exports from Sri Lanka, threat of international sanctions and loss of GSP plus facility. All this was successfully thwarted as a result of the SLFP decision to join a national government with the UNP,” the minister said.
There was unbridled freedom in the country today to even criticize the government. There was freedom to level unfounded and frivolous charges against government politicians by using the social media. But no one spoke of the immense benefits granted to the people by the government, he added.
Despite all such criticism no one would even be able to topple this government till 2020, the minister said.
