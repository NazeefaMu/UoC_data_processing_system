Devotees pay respects to Anunayake Thera

The casket bearing the remains of the Most Ven. Girambe Ananda Anunayake Thera of the Sri Lanka Ramanna Maha Nikaya were brought in a special motorcade to the Sri Sarananda Maha Pirivena Viharaya in Anuradhapura on the night of February 21.
A stream of devotees has converged on the Viharaya since February 21 night to pay their respects to a prelate who rendered invaluable service towards the religious social and economic upliftment of the people of Anuradhapura, as well as of other areas of the country.
It was Ven. Girambe Ananda Anunayake Thera who gave leadership to the Sri Sarananda Bhikkhu order which was started by the late Ven. Udunuwara Sri Sarananda Nayake Thera.
The Atamuni Maha Seya built under his direction at the Sri Sarananda Pirivena complex in Anuradhapura is one of the lasting monuments to the late Anunayake Thera. The late Thera was also well known for his literary and artistic talents. He was born in Girambe, Othota Korale, on May 19, 1938.
His cremation will be held tomorrow under state patronage, at Harischandra Park, Anuradhapura. The members of the Adahana committee had a meeting on February 20 to organise the final arrangements.
