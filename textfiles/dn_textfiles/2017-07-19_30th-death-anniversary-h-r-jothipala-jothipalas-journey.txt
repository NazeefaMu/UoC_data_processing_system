On July 7, 1987, the entire nation was shocked to hear unbelievably the sad news on the sudden loss of Singer/Actor H.R.Jothipala, the Legend of the era. It was a sad end of a golden voice that had captured the hearts of young and old both locally and overseas. His indomitable melodious voice opened a new era of music with everlasting songs still popular in the country and abroad.
His name is so popular that even after 30 years, his songs are still sung by other singers and amateur singers at reality shows, musical evenings, commercial records etc. The miraculous fact is that the name of this innate talented singer with an unsurpassed singing excellence and incredible humility still shines at the zenith of its glory even after thirty years of his demise.
This is a tribute to Jothipala on his 30th Death Anniversary which has been commemorated on July 7, 2017, covering significant stories of his singing life.
Playback singer
Born on 12th February 1936 in Ketawalamulla, Dematagoda, Colombo to a middle-class family, this future giant play-back singer Hettiarachchige Reginald Jothipala or H.R. Jothipala displayed his innate talents of vocals since his boyhood. His mother was H K Podinona Perera and fatherHettiarachchige Reginald Jamis was a tailor by profession. He studied at St. Lawrence College, Maradana and St. John’s College, Dematagoda. As the family did not own a radio, he was tempted to visit a Tea Kiosk in his area very frequently to listen to music. Since his salad days, he was fondly called by abbreviated name Jothi which later became incredibly popular.
There are many stories spread on the first step of Jothi ‘s entry into Music Field or Kala Lokaya. According to the information gathered from a soulful facebook page called “Supembara Jothi” created by a certain group of his fans led by Harindra Lakmal, first, the formal attempt was participating the completions conducted by Ceylon Broadcasting ( Now Sri Lanka Broadcasting Corporation ).A book named “The Dignitary of Malays” has quoted that the famous musician late Stanley Omar was in the same room with Jothipala in Maligakannda, Maradana and Jothipala was introduced to Ariyadasa Pieris by Omar for an opportunity to sing in “Adhunika Peya”.
“Adhunika Peya” conducted by Ceylon Broadcasting (Now SLBC) and sponsored by Regina Losingers Company in 1952 was his first step in his endeavour which became incredibly a success. One of the hot favourite Hindi film songs “Sukriya” sung by Talat Mahamood was the song sung by Jothi at this competition for which he was awarded the first place with a parcel of sweets from the sponsors. Subsequently, in presenting his innate indisputable singing skills at Jayagrahaka Pelapaliya, he was crowned the Best Singer for which he was awarded a Parker 51 pen by the organisers.
His first song “thotiyo thotiyo” was mainly sung by Wasantha Sandanayake in the latter part of 1954. It was only three words “thotiyo thotiyo thotiyo” sung by him. However ‘Lebeiee Sithalada Ale Kale’ is considered as his first full song sung with G.S.B.Rani Perera in 1954. Again in 1955, he sang a duet ‘Ada Ada Eyiee Maruwa ‘with Wasantha Sandanayake in 1955. Jothi’s first solo was ‘ Mage Ran Rajaniee’ with the music of Stanley Omar in 1955.
There is a very interesting story on Jothi’s entry to Music world (Kala Lokaya). This story was told by Darshani Chandrasena, the daughter of R.A. Chandrasena, a legendary maestro Music Director who introduced a number of singers who later rose to the apex of popularity. The significant factor is that this story was told by Darshani with the historical documents including a letter written by Jothi in his own handwriting as proof of evidence to a true story.
Opportunity
A get-together of a musical evening ( Peduru Sajje ) was organised by famous journalist Sisira Kumara Manikkaarchchi at his residence Nugegoda on 13th February 1953 on the occasion of the popular female playback singer G.S.B.Rani Perera’s marriage with Anton Perera. Music was directed by the great musician R.A.Chandrasena. At this friendly event, an invitee who was a famous personality from Maradana introduced a young amateur singer to Anton Perera and requested to give him an opportunity at this evening. It was a magnificent opportunity for this amateur to impress not only the audience but also R.A.Chandrasena by his masterly performance of singing with his mellifluous voice. He was none other than H.R.Jothipala who later became the indomitable playback singer in Sri Lanka.
Since then Jothipala became closely attached to Chandrasena and Sriyani Chandrasena who treated him as their own son. The letter written by Jothipala in 1954 to Chandrasena who was in India for Mathabhedaya recordings addressed as “My friend and Teacher” is a case in point. He in early days always respected both Chandrasena and Mrs Chandrasena at his best.
Chandrasena in recognition of Jothi’s talents continued to help sing at his fully packed musical events like Chathurangani and Panchangani and also selected him to sing in his films.
Chandrasena selected Jothipala to sing in the Film Mathabhedaya directed by B.A.W. Jayamanne. It was his first experience of Chandrasena as a Music Director of a film directed by himself. B.A.W. Jayamanna mostly preferred to use Mohideen Baig as the male voice in his films. One day Chandrasena visited B.A. W.’s residence with Jothi to discuss music on film Mathabedhaya with a hidden objective to make a path to young Jothipala to enter play back singing of films.
Chandrasena was so nice to influence B.A.W. Jayamanne for young singer Jothipala to sing in Mathabhedaya directed by B.A.W. Jayamanna in 1955. Chandrsena took much interest in having rehearsals with Jothi for the song “Ginnaki Hada Mage ” at his own home. Chandrasena requested Jothi to get prepared to fly to India for recordings. As advised by Chandrasena Jothi reached Ratmalana Airport on a specific date with his bag and baggage but he did not have his passport. His ignorance, unfortunately, missed a golden opportunity that would have changed his singing career in becoming the playback singer for Mathabhedaya.
Adverse comment
His determination to traverse against numerous challenges with strength and courage helped him achieve his potential. These stories begin with film Perakadoru Bena. He was then later selected by the Music Director B.S.Perera to sing in “Perakadoru Bena”, a chance he again missed by an adverse comment made by film director A.B.Raj who dismissed his voice as unsuitable for recording.
Failing to sing in Mathabhedaya and Perakadoru Bena, Jothi was introduced by musician T.F. Lathif to Film Director Sirisena Wimalaweera . Jothi was invited by Sirisena Wimalaweera to sing a duet with G.S.B.Rani Perera in the film Podi Putha. He missed this opportunity too as his voice was decided unsuitable after audition by the Sound Engineer and Sirisena Wimalaweera. On release of the film, he went to watch the film proudly with his friends. He was surprised to notice that Haroon Lanthra and Rani Perera had later recorded the song ‘ Oh Kiri Muhuda Kalamba ‘for the film.
Jothi’s dream to be a playback singer became a reality with the release of Surathalee in 1956, a triumphant achievement of a long experienced struggle through hurdle after hurdle. Once when Jothi approached the Giant Film Producer Jabir A.Cader with the support of Jothi’s influenced friends, Carder had asked Jothi to see him back with a recorded song before he decides the suitability of the voice. Reputed Musician Stanley Omar was so generous to encourage Jothi with Rs.35/ which was high in value at the time. Jothi was able to do a recording accordingly. In recognition of his talented skills in vocals after listen to the song, Cader generously opened the avenue of opportunity to sing in Surathalee, a film produced by Carder.
