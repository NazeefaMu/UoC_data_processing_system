Candidates who failed to poll over 5% of votes

The surety deposits of candidates who did not poll more than 5 percent of the total valid votes polled at the recently concluded Local Government (LG)Election, will be forfeited to Government, Election Commission Chairman Mahinda Deshapriya said.
The surety deposit for a candidate representing an independent group was Rs. 5,000, while it was Rs. 1,500 for a candidate of a political party.
Deshapriya said there are political parties which have obtained one seat but polled less than five percent of the total valid votes at the LG body. “There are political parties which have obtained 4.5 percent at the council and managed to secure one seat, but still the surety deposit is non-refundable,” he added.
He said the surety deposit of candidates in the additional list would not be refunded if their political party or the independent group failed to obtain at least five percent of the votes in their respective council.
He said the Elections Secretariat is in the process of refunding the surety deposits of all other candidates.
