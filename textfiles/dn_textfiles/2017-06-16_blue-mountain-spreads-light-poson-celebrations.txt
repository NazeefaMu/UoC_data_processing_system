Blue Mountain spreads light for Poson celebrations

Blue Mountain’s erected lanterns to brighten up the streets of Colombo for Poson. This initiative carried out in partnership with the Colombo Municipal Council to celebrate the poya.
Like with every Poya Day during the year, Sri Lankan Buddhists celebrate different aspects of Buddhism through various practices. Poson is especially regarded, like Vesak, because it represents the introduction of Buddhism to Sri Lanka.
A major symbol during this event is Mihintale, the location where his historic event locally known as “Mahindagamanaya” took place.
Blue Mountain’s also recently illuminated the UN Vesak Day celebrations which was celebrated in Sri Lanka this year with the participation of Buddhist leaders from around the world.
The three-day celebration began on May 12 in Colombo and consisted of an International Buddhist Symposium with the participation of over 400 delegates from 100 countries. Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the Nepali President Bidya Devi Bhandari attended the UN Vesak Day celebrations.
For Poson, Sri Lanka’s foremost real estate company, Blue Mountain, placed over 600 lanterns on either sides in and around the Townhall area with 6-feet tall lanterns in the shapes of lotus flowers and stupas (daagaba) at every six metres to light up the streets and spread the joy of Poson.
