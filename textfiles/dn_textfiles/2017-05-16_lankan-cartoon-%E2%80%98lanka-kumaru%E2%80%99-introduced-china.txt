A cartoon named ‘Lanka Kumaru’ (Prince of Lanka) was introduced to China in the presence of Sri Lankan Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe.

The initiative is one from Beijing KAKU Media Company that is affiliated to Beijing Television.
The Deputy General Manager of Beijing Television said they expect to do more television exchanging programs between Sri Lanka and China after completing ‘Prince of Lanka’.

Special Assignments Minister Sarath Amunugama said Sri Lanka stands to gain an advantage from the cartoon movie as more than 900 million would watch the programme.
