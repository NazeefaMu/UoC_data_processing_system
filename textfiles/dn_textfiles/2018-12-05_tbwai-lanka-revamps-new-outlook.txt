TBWAi Lanka revamps with new outlook

TBWAi Lanka, one of Sri Lanka’s longstanding and leading advertising agencies, revamped their workspace recently, introducing a creative and uplifting ambience to their office.
To mark this fresh start and to also celebrate their recent success at Campaign Brief Asia’s creative agency rankings, the agency hosted their clients at their office. The invitees were given the chance to mingle with those that handle their brands while taking in the newly furbished office space.
“TBWAi Lanka believes in changing and evolving progressively as we move forward in our journey and that is why we are very happy to introduce our freshly revamped office to our clients and stakeholders. We know that a visually stimulating and relaxing work environment like this will help bring out the best in our creative and disruptive work,” said Renuka Marshall, Managing Director – TBWAi Lanka.
The revamped office space has been designed to inspire creativity, enhance team relations and help staff relax and think big. The newly refurbished area consists of an expanse of wooden floors, glass door that extend right up to the ceiling creating a sense of openness, accents of cheerful yellow, tastefully selected art and a café area that doubles as a work space. There is a breakout room with a pool table and funny slogans are scattered on the walls everywhere. The space seems to translate very well the personalities that hold within its walls.
“2018 has been a very exciting year for us and looking back we are delighted at the journey we have made. Our Agency has yet again been named the ‘2018 Sri Lanka Creative Agency of the Year’ by Campaign Brief Asia which is indeed a great honour to us and a credit to the work we do. We are proud to have received this recognition back to back and we look forward to more exciting times ahead,” Renuka added.
