Around 650 Indian fishermen in custody in neighbouring countries

Nearly 650 Indian fishermen have been arrested until October this year by maritime security agencies of different countries, with Sri Lanka topping the chart.
According to government sources, some 350 fishermen have been arrested and 52 fishing trawlers seized by Sri Lankan navy, while Pakistan's MSA has arrested 239 Indian fishermen and impounded 35 fishing boats. Bangladesh has 56 and Burma six Indian fishermen in its custody.
In a majority of these cases Indian fishermen ventured into the waters or the Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) of the neighbouring countries, which led their maritime security agencies to take action against them.
