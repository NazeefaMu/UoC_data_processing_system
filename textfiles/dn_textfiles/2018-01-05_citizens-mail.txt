Citizen's Mail

Investment for higher studies
GCE A/L results were released last week. Some students have performed well and proved their eligibility to enter universities. On the contrary another batch of students has scraped through the examination without being eligibile for the university entrance. All that leads us to one cruel factor: GCE A/L is a crucial competition.
The would-be university undergraduates have performed well on various grounds. They have attended the best schools, for one. They have studied under the best teachers, on the other hand. The students from financially-stable families would attend good tuition classes.
This group of students is lucky to have affluent as well as well educated parents. Intelligence comes easily for them.
But it is not the same phenomenon oftentimes. In some cases, the parents and teachers are not in a position to offer proper guidance to the students. In such a backdrop, the students have to be satisfied with average results.
Then these students try their level best to try out a private university. As a nation, we must concentrate on such students to provide them financial assistance. The government must draw their attention to such students in particular.
That is the only path, laid before us, to steer this nation towards prosperity.
