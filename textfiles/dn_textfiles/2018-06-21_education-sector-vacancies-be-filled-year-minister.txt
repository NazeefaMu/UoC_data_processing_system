Education sector vacancies to be filled this year - Minister

All vacancies in the education sector will be filled by the end of this year, Education Minister Akila Viraj Kariyawasam said.
Vacancies in several sectors in the education sector including the Teachers’ Service, Principals’ Service, Teacher Educator Service and the Teacher Trainer's Service will be filled by the end of this year.
He made these remarks at a ceremony to award appointments to the Sri Lanka Teacher Educator Service at Temple Trees yesterday. The event was held under the patronage of Speaker Karu Jayasuriya.
The Minister said there were 1,119 vacancies in the Sri Lanka Teacher Educator Service when this government came to power. But no action had been taken to fill these vacancies until this government took action to fill those vacancies in 2016.
“I wonder how the Colleges of Education were functioning with such a huge number of vacancies,” he said.
Of the 1,119 vacancies in the Sri Lanka Teacher Educator Service by 2015, 786 vacancies were filled by 2016 and the balance of 352 teacher educators were awarded appointments yesterday.
"Teacher Trainers serving at 19 Colleges of Education are responsible to take the education sector forward as persons who train teachers. If they make any wrong or if their duty is not done properly, the entire nation will be affected,” he said.
Minister added that the teacher training should be more streamlined and the education of Colleges of Education should promptly be more modified as per the novel developments of the education sector.
Speaking on the measure taken to streamline the service of Sri Lanka Teacher Educators, the Minister said that moves are under way to provide more and effective local and foreign training for them.
Minister said that 13 year education for every child is compulsory now. “Under this move, no one drops out from the education system until receiving the compulsory 13 year education. Even the students, who failed at GCE Ordinary Level can continue their education up to a degree. More priority has been given to technical education,” he said.
