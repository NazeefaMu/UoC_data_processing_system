SLASSCOM Offers Rewards  Program with CH17 Loyalty

SLASSCOM has partnered with CH17 Loyalty to launch an employee privileges program exclusively for those engaged in the IT/BPM industry. This program will be introduced shortly with the objective of rewarding the individuals employed in the industry for their contribution towards the country’s IT/BPM Sector.
The industry is currently ranked the fifth largest export earner for Sri Lanka and generates over US$ 1.2 billion in export revenues. It is also a thrust industry within the National Export Strategy (NES) and aspires to grow to become a US$ 5 billion industry with a workforce of over 200,000 employees by 2022.
The program will be rolled out through participating SLASSCOM member companies, who will be able to offer these cards to their employees at a discounted rate. SLASSCOM has engaged CH17 Loyalty to implement this program based on CH17 Loyalty’s wide experience, knowledge and it’s acceptance in corporate loyalty management.
A memorandum of understanding to launch this initiative was signed between SLASSCOM and CH17 Loyalty to design, develop and implement a multi-facility scheme for the employees of SLASSCOM’s member companies, currently exceeding 200 members.
The privileges include special rates for products from recognised vendors of IT related brands, lifestyle products, daily essentials, personal items, hospitality, dining and leisure, wellness and heath related services, banking and financial facilities, insurance and telecom services, transport and travel and many more. Jeevan Gnanam, Chairman SLASSCOM, said that he was delighted with the idea of introducing such a program for the IT/BPM professionals which gives them multiple benefits and privileges from vendors across the country throughout the year. He also added that the industry privilege card will be a means to access customized benefits relevant to the workforce in the industry and also create a sense of pride. Jumar Preena, CEO and Founder of CH17 Loyalty said that he was honored to be part of possibly the fastest growing industry in Sri Lanka in terms of workforce and revenue. “We will continue to add many benefits and privileges in the months to come, contracting retailers overseas to meet the expectations and demands of this sector.”
