Citizens' Mail

Let us age with grace
Not a day seems to pass without hearing of the passing away of some friend whom we have known for most of our lives. This is nothing new. We have accepted this and learned to live with it.
We cannot drive as we did before because of the heavy traffic now on our roads. We need to use public transport which involves standing in queues. It is also most tiresome. There are many other problems too which we face but biggest of them, for those of us who are single, is finding suitable accommodation. This is where the State can and has a major humanitarian role to play. The government could invite the big foreign and local companies to become partners for instance in the proposed new project where the Bambalapitiya Flats (which are to be demolished) are now located.
A small part of one of the many Towers it is claimed would be built, could be reserved for us. That would give us our security and also provide the fellowship we would need. We Seniors could also in our own humble way contribute to the cost involved. I do hope that President Maithripala Sirisena who could live up to his name and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe would help us die happily and above all with gratitude and peace.
