PLA Navy ships to conduct relief operations here

Three ships of the People's Liberation Army Navy (PLA Navy) arrived at the Port of Colombo on Wednesday evening to assist the ongoing relief operations, following the adverse weather that wreaked havoc in the island nation.
The ships which were initially on a goodwill, subsequently focused their intentions on relief efforts to help the general public battered by inclement weather. Incidentally, 5 teams of medical personnel along with 10 small boats aboard these ships, are expected to be deployed in relief operations in close collaboration with the Sri Lanka Nav.
The large consignment of relief materials dispatched by the Chinese Government was officially handed over to the Navy Commander. This noble gesture yet again proved the long and strong camaraderie of the two countries and mutual cooperation between the PLA and Sri Lanka Navies.
