Compilation of GDP complies with international standards: DCS

The following is a clarification issued by the Department of Census and Statistics (DCS) on certain matters related to the compilation and revision of National Account Estimates.
National Account Estimates are compiled by the DCS quarterly and annually, with a time lag of 75 days. National Accounts Statistics compiled by the DCS includes Gross Domestic Product (GDP) by production, Income and Expenditures approaches, Gross National Income, Gross National Disposable Income, and Gross Savings.
National Accounts Base Year
The National Accounts’ base year is the year used as the base period for constant price calculations in the country’s National Accounts. It is recommended that the base year of constant price estimates be changed periodically to reflect changes in the economic structure and relative prices and this process is commonly known as ‘rebasing’.
Need to revise base year
Rebasing of the National Accounts series is the process of replacing an old base year used to compile GDP at constant prices with a new and more recent base year or price structure. Economies are dynamic in nature: they grow, shrink, new economic activities emerge, new technologies are used, and consumer behaviour and preferences change over time. Rebasing is used to capture these changes so as to give an accurate picture of an economy.
Most recent round of rebasing
In the history of compiling National Account Estimates of Sri Lanka, the base year had been revised to years 1958, 1963, 1975, 1990, 1998 and 2002. Rebasing is an extensive exercise and needs a few years to complete as it involves several activities including inclusion of emerging economic activities, making data available through new surveys, censuses, and administrative records, etc. In 2011, the work related to moving the base year from 2002 to 2010 with technical assistance from international agencies including the Asian Development Bank and International Monitory Fund commenced. Rebasing activities were completed by the end of 2014. Releasing National Account Estimates with respect to the new base year 2010 commenced from the first quarter of 2015. Since then, the base year for National Accounts released by the DCS is 2010.
Revision of published National Accounts Estimates
For compiling National Account Estimates, data is needed from a broad spectrum, through various sources covering all the economic activities of the country. For instance, in each quarter, administrative data are collected from about 250 organisations. Apart from that, data are also collected through, censuses, surveys, administrative reports, annual reports, research reports, etc. However, there are instances where the required data are not available at the time of releasing the National Accounts Estimates. For certain economic activities, it takes a year or more to obtain the finalised data required for calculation of National Account Estimates.
For example, there are two paddy cultivation seasons in our country - Maha and Yala. Harvesting of the Maha and Yala seasons takes place from February to April and August to September respectively. However, the sowing periods of the Maha and Yala seasons span from September to March and April to August respectively. The value added of rice growing is estimated and used in the respective quarters in GDP Estimates as final production statistics are not available for the respective quarters. Final real output or production data will only be available when the harvesting is over in the entire country. Only the final quarterly and annual value added of the rice growing sub-economic activity can be calculated in the respective quarters.
Accordingly, provisional data are used for some economic activities in compiling National Account Estimates. Therefore, the National Accounts Estimates already released need to be updated or revised for no reason other than the final data becoming available. If not revised, the true scenario of the economy may not be captured correctly.
Revising GDP estimates is an internationally recommended practice and is being practised in many countries. National Accounts Estimates cannot be analysed in the future if final National Account Estimates are calculated and recorded when the final data become available.
Revision policy
As per International National Accounts Guidelines and like many other National Accounts compiling countries, DCS introduced a revision policy for Sri Lanka during the last rebasing exercise, which was published in the second quarter of 2015. According to this published revision policy, the National Account Estimates issued for a particular quarter or year can continue to be revised as explained below.
According to the revision policy of National Account Estimates, provisional estimates are prepared and published 75 days after the respective quarter. These estimates are based on quick estimates or provisional data obtained from different sources. Similarly, in 75 days after completing a year, annual estimates and fourth quarter estimates are released with the revised estimates for the first three quarters of the same year and for the previous two years. These estimates are known as ‘revised provisional’ estimates. After receiving the final data for the year, ‘final Quarterly and Annual National Accounts Estimates’ are released. All the revisions are published in the ‘Revision Triangle’, under the National Accounts section of the DCS website.
Many countries which prepare National Account Estimates in a proper manner use a revision policy for compilation and publishing of National Account Estimates. For example, according to the National Accounts revision policy of the United States of America (USA), there are provisions to revise the GDP estimates even up to 20 times each quarter per year. USA and Great Britain and almost all other European countries follow similar revision policies.
Revision of GDP and updating growth rate
In general, the economic growth rate is the rate at which a nation’s GDP changes or grows from one year to another. Similarly, economic growth rate of a quarter is calculated as the percentage change of the real GDP of a quarter compared to the same quarter of the previous year. Therefore, it is clear that the revision of GDP of a quarter or a year leads to updating the corresponding growth rates.
For example, the published provisional estimate of real GDP for the first quarter of 2017 was Rs. 2,161,770 million. As per the revision policy, by now it has been revised four times. The estimated GDP of the first quarter of 2017 at the first, second, third and fourth revisions were Rs. 2,161,735 million, Rs. 2,164,747 million, Rs. 2,154,971 million and Rs. 2,155,247 million respectively. These revisions were done on June 15, 2017, September 15, 2017, December 15, 2017, March 20, 20180 and June 18, 2018, respectively. According to these revisions of GDP, the growth rate of the first quarter of 2017 was revised as 3.8, 3.8, 3.95, 3.35, and 3.37 respectively on the above dates. (The GDP of the first quarter of 2016 was also revised several times for reasons explained above.)
The latest estimated growth rate for the first quarter of 2018 (released on June 18, 2018) was 3.2 as the percentage change from the most recent GDP estimates of the first quarter of 2017 of Rs. 2,155,247 million to Rs. 2,223,856 million, that of first quarter of 2018. In calculating growth rates, most recent estimates of real GDP of both years should be used and not revised values of previous rounds.
Compiling estimates using data from two base year periods
No National Accounts Estimate can be compiled using data under the base year 2010 and data under the previous base year periods together. The main reason for this is that during the last base year revision, parallel to moving the base year from 2002 to 2010, a number of improvements for the National account compilation process were introduced. Those improvements include methodological changes, coverage expansion of production boundary, adaptation to latest classifications and SNA – 2008.
GDP deflator
By complying with internationally recommended procedures, GDP is calculated at nominal (current) and real (constant) prices. After compilation of GDP, a number of macro-economic indicators are prepared. One of the very important such indicators is the GDP implicit price deflator which is a measure of the level of prices of all new domestically produced final goods and services in an economy. The GDP implicit price deflator considers all the economic activities of the entire economy and serves the purpose of measuring inflation of the country. This is one of the indicators used to measure the changes in the price levels of finished goods and services at a particular period of time.
The GDP deflator is calculated by dividing Nominal (current) GDP by Real (constant) GDP. Accordingly, the GDP deflator is compiled after compiling GDP, but not the other way around.
Impact of revision of GDP on GDP deflator
Obviously as the GDP is revised as per the Revision Policy of National Accounts, the GDP implicit price deflator too get revised since the GDP deflator is the rate calculated by dividing nominal GDP by real GDP. Therefore, the GDP implicit price deflator is a byproduct of the National Accounts compilation process. Before compiling the GDP deflator, thousands of calculations need to be done in a number of worksheets to compile GDP Estimates. Therefore, it is almost impossible to carry out backward calculations to obtain GDP with pre-decided GDP deflators, and it is not an internationally accepted practice of estimating National Accounts Statistics.
Publishing National Accounts Estimates
All National Account Estimates compiled by the DCS, including all revisions, are published in the DCS website - www.statistics.gov.lk. These numbers are quoted and published by some other institutions in their publications. However, estimates published in their publications may not necessarily be the most recent revisions. Therefore, it is recommended to use the DCS website to obtain the most recent statistics.
Colombo Consumer Price Index (CCPI)
The Consumer Price Index (CPI) is an indicator that measures the weighted average of market prices of a selected basket of consumer goods and services. The CCPI is calculated and published monthly by the DCS, on the last working day of the month. It is calculated by taking price changes for each item in the predetermined basket of goods and averaging them. Market prices, not provisional prices of these goods and services are collected from 14 selected markets in the urban areas of Colombo District to calculate the CCPI through a price survey. Therefore, there is no need to revise the published Colombo Consumer Price Index as the prices used were actual prices. Contrary to this, GDP estimates need to be revised as the value added of certain sub-economic activities is estimated using provisional data.
