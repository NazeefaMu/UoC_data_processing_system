Tissue culture: Towards better coconut plantations

Coconut, a tree that has a tall elegant trunk topped by a crown of green leathery leaves covering about 100 feet circumference, is one of the few trees which is traditionally bound with the Sri Lankans. As a plantation crop, it plays a vital role in the Sri Lankan economy.
There is no single plant which gives so much to man in a variety of ways. However, in Sri Lanka the coconut acreage is shrinking due to urbanisation, pests, diseases, and drought.
Even though there is a rising demand for coconut-based health and beauty products in the world, the exportable supply declines due to the increasing population which is ultimately responsible for the higher domestic consumption.
To overcome this problem, the creation of new and commercially desirable cultivars which are genetically uniform with agronomically superior characters, becomes essential and this can be achieved only by a proper breeding programme. However, due to the long life span and high genetic variability in the coconut populations (heterozygosity), coconut breeding is a long, difficult and an expensive process.
The situation is worse as coconut lacks a vegetative propagation method. A method which can be used to propagate high yielding, disease-resistant varieties rapidly will break the present yield barrier of coconut and give the strength to fight with other oil crops to retain its status as an important food source. Application of biotechnological tools for crop improvement is essential and one area under focus is clonal propagation of coconut through tissue culture technology.
Tissue culture (In vitro culture)
Tissue culture is a technique by which excised plant tissues, organs or plant cells are cultured aseptically in specially formulated artificial nutrient media, inside glass vessels, under controlled environmental conditions to grow in to new plants. The capacity of a single plant cell to divideand differentiate to generate an entire plant (totipotency) is the phenomenon behind this technique.
This is a valuable tool for plant breeders to speed up the breeding and multiplication of promising genotypes when conventional breeding methods take more than a decade. Two types of in vitro culture techniques are useful for crop improvement of coconut.
1. Micro propagation of coconut
Micropropagationwhich is a form of tissue culture is the practice of rapid multiplication of plant material to produce a large number of daughter plants. Thousands of copies of a plant can be produced using this method. The resulting daughter plants are identical to the mother plant and are similar to each other. The group of plants derived from a single individual through micropropagationis called a ‘clone'.
Coconut is usually propagated by seed. It is the easiest and quickest method of propagation. Due to the genetic variability of coconut populations (Being a heterozygous palm), when propagated by seed, there will be much variation within the progeny. Desirable characteristics of the parent palm may not be seen in the progeny palms. In other words, no two seedling palms are alike. By multiplying high performance individuals through tissue culture, uniform daughter palms can be produced which are identical to the mother palm.
This would allow significant yield increases by propagation of high yielding individuals. In the same way, palms exhibiting resistance to certain diseases and tolerance to adverse growing conditions could be propagated. In other words clonal propagation would mean more rapid availability of breeding results to the coconut growers.
As a result of extensive research done over the years, it is now possible to regenerate coconut plants through tissue culture.Micropropagation of coconut occurs through a process called “somatic embryogenesis”, by undergoing a sequence of steps. In the present process, new plants are formed from somatic embryos which are formed from plant cells that are not normally involved in the development of embryos.
The first step in the somatic embryogenesis pathway is the production of an undifferentiated mass of cells called ‘callus'from the cultured plant tissue. These callus cells re-differentiate into somatic embryos under the appropriate culture conditions and optimum combinations of hormones.
Somatic embryos later develop into complete plantlets when given the appropriate conditions.The physiological and anatomical characteristics of micropropagated plantlets necessitate that they should be gradually acclimatized to the field environment. During acclimatization,coconut plantletsare placed in free-living conditions to acquire where they must photosynthesize and overcome challenges from microbes.
There were a lot of constrains to be solved during the journey of developing a protocol for coconut micropopagation. These were addressed one by one and considerable progress has been achieved so far. In any plant tissue culture protocol, selection of a suitable starting plant material (explant) is a major factor which governs the successful plant regeneration.
Various tissues including tender leaf, immature inflorescence, shoot tip, immature embryo and plumule (obtained from the mature embryo) and unfertilized ovaries have been used in clonal propagation research.Among the several explants tested so far, unfertilized ovary which is collected from unopened female flowers have shown to be the most promising explant.In coconut, a new inforescence emerges at the tip of the crown every four weeks.
After emergence, the spathe splits open due to the expansion of the inorescence. When collecting explants for coconut micropropagation, newly split open inorescence is designated as stage 0 and the next inflorescence immediately below it, which has not opened, as stage -1. Unfertilized ovaries are dissected from immature inflorescences collected from -4 stages (inflorescence to be opened in 4 months time) causing a minimal damage to the mother palm while collecting explants. Thus this technique allows repeated collection of explants from the same mother palm in 6 - 9 month intervals.From one particular inflorescence the number of explants which can be cultured is low because the average number of female flowers that exist is generally around 30. This is one of the drawbacks of using unfertilized ovary as the explant limiting large scale culturing to produce higher number of clonal plants. This canbe overcome by a callus multiplication phase introduced after callus initiation. Callus multiplication finally contributes to an increase in the success rate of plant regeneration. Tissue culture response of unfertilized ovary explants excised from each palm shows very high variation. In order to overcome this limitation, attempts have been made to identify a pool of mother palms which are responsive for in vitroculture. Activated charcoal has been used during culture process in order to prevent tissue browning.In spite of its advantage of adsorbing growth inhibitory substances; activated charcoal also adsorbs growth regulators especially synthetic auxins such as 2, 4-D in the medium which ultimately lead to undefined culture conditions.The problems associated with batch to batch character difference in activated charcoal were minimized by using Activated coconut shell charcoal (ACSC) from a Sri Lankan Company. ACSCis a guaranteed source of activated charcoal with consistent characteristics and the product has been assured for having the same origin throughout and guaranteed by the manufacturer.
Even though plant regeneration from various tissues is possible, the number of clonal plants obtained still remains low. However, not like in previous days, now it is possible to regenerate coconut plantlets consistently through micropropgation. Slow growth and low survival rate of clonal plants after transplanting in soil are other handicaps that need to be resolved through further research efforts. The promising results obtained so far by ovary culture indicated that cloning coconut is not far-fetched and it can become a reality in the near future. This will also lead to rapid mass propagation of improved varieties ensuring a steady supply of uniform, high quality planting material to growers.
2. Mature zygotic embryo culture
Besides clonal propagation, embryo culture technology is also an important tool for plant improvement. This technique mainly facilitates collection, exchange and conservation of coconut germplasm.Embryo culture involves excising an embryo aseptically from the seed and planting it in a sterile nutrient medium. Instead of the endosperm in the seed, culture medium provides all the necessary ingredients for the embryos to germinate and develop into complete plants.
In vitro raised, embryo germinated plants are transferred to soil within 6-8 months of culture. After a few months of hardening, they could be planted in the field. Embryo culture is a fairly simple technique which is easy to perform. This is mainly used for three main purposes.
i. Embryo rescue
Embryo culture technology is used to save embryos that fail to develop naturally. One such coconut type is Dikiri coconut. Dikiri coconuts are characterized by the soft, jelly-like kernel that almost fills the interior of the nut. The liquid endosperm in these nuts is thick and viscous instead of watery. Coconut cultivars with similar kernel characters are found in different countries with different names; Makapuno in the Philippines, Kopyor in Indonesia, ThairuThengai or NeiThengai or Ghee Thengai in India and Mapharao Khati in Thailand.
The Makapuno is an expensive delicacy and its planting material is highly priced in the Philippines. In Sri Lanka, dikiri-bearing palms are rare and they are mainly confined to Weligama area in the Matara District.
This type of coconut has a very limited production (normally, only 2-20% Dikiri nuts could be harvested from an ordinary Dikiri-bearing palm) and is of high price, which is more than 10 times higher than the normal fresh coconut due to soft and sweet flesh, meaning that it is much sought after by customers. Due to the economic benefits, the farmers are keen to propagate and build up a population of Dikiri plants.
Micropropagation of coconut through somatic embryogenesis using unfertilized ovaries as the explant
However,Dikiri nuts do not germinate under normal conditions because the endosperm which supports the germination of the embryo is abnormal and rots when the nut matures. Farmers face problems raising Dikiri palms due to this problem.
Now the embryo culture technology is used successfully at CRI to rescue Dikiri embryos. Since the embryo present in the Dikiri nut is normal, it can be removed from the abnormal kernel (embryo rescue) and cultured in a suitable growth medium. Resulting plants have the potential of producing 75-100% Dikiri nut yield if planted together and/or isolated from other coconut palms by a pollen barrier.Distribution of Dikiri plants among growershas an impact on poverty alleviation by way of improving the smallholder's income. Nearly 100 in vitroraised Dikiri plants have been established in the field and some plants have already been distributed among farmers.
ii. Germplasm exchange
Coconut growing countries including Sri Lanka face problems when trying to develop new varieties due to thelimited availability of genetic material for the breeders to use. This is one of the major obstaclesthat delay the progress in coconut variety improvement. This problem could be solved if coconut material from different coconut growing countries could be exchanged for coconut breeding programmes.
Germplasm materials are now made available to interested coconut producing countries through a programme lounged by Coconut Genetic Resources Network (COGENT). However, exchange of coconut germplasm was hampered by the large size of the nut, lack of dormancy and phytosanitary difficulties. Embryo culture provides a solution to these problems.
Germplasm can be exchanged in the form of excised embryosin small tubes and germinate them in to complete plantlets in the recipient country. The safe movement of germplasm is assured through this technology as the risk of contamination is minimal.Under the germplasm exchange program, embryos from twenty three varieties were brought from three different countries namely India, Papua New Guinea and Ivory Coast.
These embryos were grown in culture and the resulting plants were field planted.These varieties will be used by the coconut breeders of Sri Lanka for future-breeding programmes.
iii. Germplasm conservation
In vitro techniques are of great interest for the collecting and storage of coconut germplasm. Coconut produce recalcitrant seeds, i.e. seeds that cannot be dried to sufficiently low moisture level to allow their storage at low temperature. Traditionally, coconut genetic resources are preserved as whole plants in field gene banks. However, conservation in the field gene banks is subjected to risks of losses caused by biological and climatic hazards. In addition, field gene banks require huge land areas and routine maintenance is very expensive.
Different in vitro conservation methods are employed, depending on the storage duration requested. For short- and medium-term storage, the aim is to reduce growth and to increase the intervals between subcultures. For long-term storage, cryopreservation, i.e. storage at ultra-low temperature, usually that of liquid nitrogen (-196øC), is the only current method. At this temperature, all cellular divisions and metabolic processes are stopped.
The plant material can thus be stored without alteration or modification for a theoretically unlimited period of time. Moreover, cultures are stored in a small volume, protected from contamination, requiring very limited maintenance. Appropriate culture media have been developed to allow short and medium-term preservation of mature embryos.
Once cultured in these media, the embryos are subjected to a slow growth phase, and they can be recovered later by transferring to germination medium. Preliminary experiments done at Coconut Research Institute, Sri Lanka have also shown that long-term conservation of coconut embryos is feasible through cryopreservation.
