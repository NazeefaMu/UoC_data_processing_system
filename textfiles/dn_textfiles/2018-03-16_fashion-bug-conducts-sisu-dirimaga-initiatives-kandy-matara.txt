Fashion Bug conducts Sisu Dirimaga initiatives in Kandy, Matara

Fashion Bug recently concluded two successful career guidance programmes in Kandy and Matara, in a bid to serve students with an opportunity to enhance their knowledge in career guidance.
Fashion Bug under its educational CSR platform launched the ‘Sisu Dirimaga’ campaign in order to benefit schools across the country demonstrating the company's laudable service as a corporate citizen.
Director Fashion Bug and Founder of the Sisu Dirimaga programme, Shabier Subian attributed the success of the platform to the company's clear, coherent and long term objectives of establishing a unique CSR identity.
“The impressive numbers of participation at each programme held across Sri Lanka stands testimony to the retail clothing giant’s accomplishments,” he added.
The first programme held at Dharmaraja College, Kandy was organised in partnership with the Kandy Zonal Education Office, where 550 students from diverse communities participated in the event. The programme was conducted for Sinhala medium students by Lecturer at the Department of Psychology of the University of Peradeniya, Asanka Jayarathne. The exclusive workshop provided the young adults present with much needed support, motivation and guidance in devising the path of their chosen vocation.
The second career guidance programme hosted by Fashion Bug was held at St. Servatius College, Matara which saw the participation of over 550 students. The unique workshop benefitted students representing many schools in Matara including students from St. Servatius College, Mahamaya Balika Vidyalaya and St. Mary's Convent. The conveyor for this programme Prof. Sarath Wijesuriya of the Department of Sinhala at the University of Colombo enlightened the participants on ways of effectively mapping out their future.
The Sisu Dirimaga platform is a sustainable CSR initiative which has been successful in supporting a number of educational programmes in the country, with Fashion Bug's long term strategic objectives coupled with the retail giant’s commitment to service. The company's expenditure in millions annually serves various CSR initiatives that reach all corners of the country, ranging from sports and education, health, public service and beyond.
Their latest efforts in Kandy and Matara are a part of a major drive towards uplifting Sri Lankan youth through the Sisu Dirimaga programme.
