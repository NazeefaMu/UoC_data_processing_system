Those five runs penalty:
Roshen didn’t do it deliberately says Karunaratne

PALLEKELE, Thursday: Sri Lanka Test opener Dimuth Karunaratne sprung to the defence of team mate Roshen Silva and said that his failure to ground his bat at the non-striker’s end while taking a run was not done with deliberate intentions.
“I don’t think Roshen did it deliberately he thought the ball had gone for four and he came back to his partner to give a high five. Those things can happen it is part of the game. We don’t blame him. We are not so worried about the five runs,” said Karunaratne at the end of the second day of the second Test at Pallekele International Stadium yesterday.
“The manager spoke to the umpires and they (the umpires) thought Roshen did it deliberately,” he said.
Praising Silva for his knock of 85 that has enabled Sri Lanka to gain a useful 46-run first innings lead over England, Karunaratne said, “Roshen is a good player of spin. We saw him in Delhi where he played against Jadeja and Ashwin. He has one option and that he can use it to his advantage. That’s why on a turner like this he can take the option of rotating the strike instead of going for big shots.
“We can see how important it is when Roshane bats because when he keeps on rotating the strike it’s difficult for a bowler to bowl on one spot. When Akila (Dananjaya) and Roshane were batting England found it difficult to bowl. That is the importance of having a player like Roshane. His success from school till now and for him to perform well in domestic cricket is because he has a good mind set.”
Karunaratne stated that if Sri Lanka can pick up two early wickets before England wipe out the 46-run deficit tomorrow morning they will be able to put them under pressure.
“We have to reduce their boundary options and allow them to score only in singles because they scored in fours and sixes in the first innings. That is what they did to overcome the spin. We will have to stop them from going for those big shots and try to play with their patience,” said Karunaratne.
England hit a total of seven sixes and 24 four in their first innings of 290.
On Sri Lanka’s improved batting performance yesterday, Karunaratne said, “We didn’t talk much but it’s all about the mindset. We were thinking that England will play like South Africans but they played a really good game at Galle. Their batsmen were good against our spinners playing sweeps and reverse sweeps. When they scored 300 plus we were under pressure and we lost a couple of wickets in the morning that’s why we finished on the losing side.
“We discussed a few things about the mindset with the coach and we wanted to be more attacking and put them under pressure instead of playing defensive. The coach said to play with an attacking mindset.”
About his run out Karunaratne said that it was very unfortunate and that it was a lesson to be learnt for the future.
“England were struggling to break the partnership I had with Dhananjaya (de Silva). They tried a lot of things but we managed to counter them, however we took a wrong call. We needn’t worry about that because we will learn from them. The next time we will study the fielder before making a run. Ben Stokes has a strong arm so we will be cautious against him the next time.”
