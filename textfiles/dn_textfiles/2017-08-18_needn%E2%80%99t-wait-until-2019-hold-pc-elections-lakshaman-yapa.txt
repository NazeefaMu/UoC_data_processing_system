Needn’t wait until 2019 to hold PC elections : Lakshaman Yapa

No need to wait until the expiration of Uva Provincial Council’s term in 2019 to hold Provincial Council Elections, State Minister of Enterprise Development Lakshaman Yapa Abeywardane said.
He made this observation by refuting all allegations levelled against the government claiming that the Provincial Council elections can only be held in 2019 after the expiration of the term of the Uva Provincial Council.
Addressing the media yesterday at the SLFP Headquarters, the State Minister said that the 20th Amendment to the Constitution has been gazetted to hold all Provincial Council (PC) Elections on the same day. But, it doesn’t mean that we have to wait till the expiration of the term of the last constitute Provincial Council in 2019.
He further said that if the Chief Minister presents facts to the governor and requests the Provincial Council to be dissolved, the governor can take steps under the constitution to dissolve the Provincial Council.
“It is our duty to fulfil what people expected form the government of good governance. People who voted for us wanted to reduce the wastage of public money. The Chairman of the Elections Council announced that the holding of election on different days is a wastage of public money. So we decided to hold elections on the same day,” He added.
