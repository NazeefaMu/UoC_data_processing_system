Rishad denies Ranjan’s allegations

There had been no illegal settlement or encroachment in Wilpattu and the government authorities have already accepted this fact, Secretary to Minister Rishad Bathiudeen and Secretary to All Ceylon Makkal Congress S.Subairdeen said.Speaking to the Daily News yesterday, he strongly denied the allegations by Deputy Minister Ranjan Ramanayake that Minister Bathiudeen was responsible for the deforestation near Wilpattu.
“This was a malicious statement. We can prove it is wrong,” he said. Referring to comments by Ramanayake on racial discrimination, he said Bathiudeen had been looking after the needs of all ethnic and religious communities in Mannar and Vavuniya as a minister representing that area.
