SC stays arrest of former IGP

The Supreme Court yesterday issued an Interim Order staying the arrest of former IGP Jayantha Wickramaratne in connection with the murder of former Sunday Leader Editor Lasantha Wickremetunge.
The Supreme Court three-judge-bench comprising Justice Eva Wanasundara, Priyantha Jayawardena and Justice L.T. B. Dehideniya made this order pursuant to a Fundamental Rights petition filed by Jayantha Wickramaratne.
This order will be effective until the final determination of this petition.
The Supreme Court further granted leave to proceed with this fundamental rights petition and matter was fixed for argument on October 8.
Former IGP Jayantha Wickramaratne was questioned by the CID recently in connection with the murder of former Sunday Leader Editor Lasantha Wickremetunga. The senior police officers including former IGP Wickramaratne were questioned by the CID over the notebook belonging to Wickrematunge that had gone missing while in police custody.
Through this petition, former IGP Wickramaratne sought the intervention of the Supreme Court to exercise the fundamental rights jurisdiction to prevent an imminent arrest of him in the Lasantha Wickremetunga murder case by the Criminal Investigations Department. President’s Counsel Gamini Marapana with Manohara Silva PC, counsel Navin Marapana under the instructions of Upendra Gunasekara appeared for the petitioner.
