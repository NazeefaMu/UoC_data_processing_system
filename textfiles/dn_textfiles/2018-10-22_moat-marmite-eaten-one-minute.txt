Moat Marmite eaten in one minute

André Ortolf ate 252 g (8.8 oz) of Marmite in his home city of Augsburg, Germany in 2016. He beat the previous record of 218 g (7.6 oz), set by his hero Ashrita Furman (USA) in 2012. The divisive savoury yeast extract is popular in the UK, New Zealand and South Africa, often spread on toasted bread or in sandwiches. Prolific record-breaker Andre, who features in the #GWR2018 book, also holds records for speed eating apple sauce, cranberry sauce, baby food, yoghurt, mashed potato and mustard. Unable to satisfy his hunger for glory with just food records, he’s also well practiced in chair racing, running in clogs, pulling on wet t-shirts and more. ITV
