Help her

Pathinayaka Nethmi Wimansa, 9, of Arawattegedara Udugala, Dampahala is suffering from a congenital neuro ailment.
Her mother W. W. Susanthi says treatment for her daughter is costly, in addition to the provision of food and other forms of nutrition.
As their family is in a serious predicament, unable to find the money needed for the daughter’s expenses, they request for financial contributions from philanthropists and the public.
All contributions should be remitted to Account Number 78857296 at the Bank of Ceylon Urubokka branch.
Her contact number is 041- 7911435.
