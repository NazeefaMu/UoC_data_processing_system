Navy sends six seized Indian trawlers back

The Sri Lanka Navy handed over six Indian fishing trawlers back to India, having made repairs to them, on Saturday. The six Indian fishing trawlers were seized for poaching in the Sri Lankan territorial waters, the Navy media unit said.
The six Indian trawlers were escorted to the International Maritime Boundary Line (IMBL) north of Kankesanthurai by the Navy Ship Ranawickrama and handed over to the Indian Coast Guard Ship Abheek.
