Boost for export crop cultivation

 The unemployment problem cannot be solved by recruiting an excessive number of persons to government institutions. Instead, far more practical solutions need to be drawn up, Primary Industries Minister Daya Gamage said.
Export crop growing must be carried out throughout the country to uplift the agricultural sector, by providing infrastructure facilities for villagers, said the minister.
He was addressing a ceremony to distribute pepper and arecanut plants to nearly 1,200 housewives at the Eheliyagoda National College auditorium, recently.
It was organized jointly by the Department of Agriculture and Ministry of Export Commodity under the ‘Dhana Saviya’ concept.
A total of 36,000 pepper plants and 24,000 arecanut plants were distributed among 1,200 women in the Eheliyagoda electorate. Minister Gamage pointed out that a section of bankrupt politicians persuade people to hold demonstrations daily. The attempt to overturn 'Yahapalana Government' is futile, he added.
“The Prime Minister, by appointing me as the Primary Industries Minister, encouraged me to develop the export crop sector. Under the plant distribution programme, it is hoped to expand pepper cultivations,” he said.
Minister Gamage told participants to take part in this export crop drive to increase their income as well as the country's foreign exchange wealth.
Eheliyagoda UNP Chief Organizer and Provincial Councillors Siripala Kiriella, Samitha Atigalla and Nimal Wijenaike, Eheliyagoda DS Ranjani Dissanayake, Kiriella DS Predeepika Illuykkumbura and Eheliyagoda OIC Niroshan Dharmasena participated.
