Unilever launches AXE CLUB

Axe, the leading male grooming brand from Unilever, launched Axe Club recently at Trace Expert City at an event themed ‘Unlock your signature’. The occasion was billed as a must-see launch event of the year! In fact, the high profile launch event was partnered by leading retailers and merchants, who all came onboard with Axe for the biggest celebration of individuality with the launch of Axe Club, a digital space which will be Sri Lanka’s first-ever interactive male grooming platform.
AXE Club delivers on Axe’s brand proposition of ‘Unlock your Signature’ as the brand promotes the belief there’s no one way to be a man, thereby conceptualizing Axe Club to celebrate men’s individuality. Axe Club will infuse confidence in men by saying, ‘Be yourself’, without having to conform to any male stereotypes. Axe believes there is no ‘ideal’ man; that you can decide who you are and what you want to be; and discover your groove by experimenting with the new trends in style and grooming. Axe Club will expertly guide its members on this journey and share tips information from Sri Lanka’s leading personalities.
Members will be eligible for picking up personalised grooming routines; learning the latest fashion trends; grooming related offers and discounts; life hacks - be it business tricks or making a killer cocktail; networking and meeting like-minded people who have similar interests; enhancing professional prospects; mentorship programs with popular personalities; and exclusive invitation to events.
The launch event was facilitated by CORPORATE partners - Signature by Hameedia; Divo for men by Stone n String; Clarks & Red Tape by DSI Premier; Casio Edifice by Blink International; CHAMPION: Dilly and Carlo; Clarks; Red Tape; KTM; Divo for men by Stone and String; G Shock by Blink International; SPORT: Reebok; Puma; Body Doc and GShock by Blink International; ROGUE: Lovi; Casio Edifice by Blink International and Divo for men by Stone and String.
Marketing Director - Personal Care at Unilever Sri Lanka Nilushi Jayatileke, said, “We are excited to launch this first-ever elite grooming club for males. The AXE Club will present its members with the tools and inspire them with exclusive event opportunities, so they can embrace their own unique styles – leaving a lasting impression wherever they go! Axe encourages men to break the rules about what it means to be a man and rewrite new signature ones.”
Axe offers modern men a vast choice of fragrances to express themselves. Axe crafts products for men so that they look great, smell amazing and feel fantastic. The Axe Signature range of body perfumes is inspired by the finest fragrances the world has to offer.
