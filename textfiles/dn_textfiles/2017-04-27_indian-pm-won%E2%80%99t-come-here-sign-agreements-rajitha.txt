Indian PM won’t come here to sign agreements: Rajitha

Minister Rajitha Senaratne yesterday said Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi will not sign any agreement during his upcoming visit to the island.
“He will be here on May 11 and 12 only for the Vesak celebrations and to open a hospital in Dikkoya," Senaratne said addressing the weekly cabinet briefing at the Government Information Department.
The Cabinet granted the approval to enter into a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) between India and Sri Lanka on cooperation in economic projects. Senaratne said the MoU is relevant to agreements on 10 economic projects between Sri Lanka and India which would be discussed and signed by ministers at a later date.
“There will be no agreement on ETCA or the Trincomalee Oil Tank Farm during Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe’s visit to India or during Indian Prime Minister’s visit here," the minister said.
