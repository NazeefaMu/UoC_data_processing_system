‘Blade Runner 2049’ is Oscar-worthy?

Ever since it hit the screens this week, ‘Blade Runner 2049’ has garnered rave reviews. In fact, labelled by some critics as the “best film of 2017”, the Denis Villeneuve-directorial is being seen as a front runner at the Academy Awards in March 2018.
The film has managed to woo critics across the globe, who have described it as “next level staggering”, “awe-inspiring”, “10 on 10”, “breathtaking” and “mesmerising”. They have unanimously called it “visually stunning and narratively satisfying”.
A leading review aggregator website currently rates the film at 94 percent on Tomatometer.
The movie, which brings together over 10 Academy Award nominees and winners, has scored especially on its “compelling narrative”, “enthralling cinematography” and “haunting music score”. With Ryan Gosling and Harrison Ford coming together for the first time, this is a film not to be missed this weekend.
