Allianz ranked No.1 insurer in Dow Jones Sustainability Index

Allianz Group has taken the leading position among all rated insurance companies in the latest Dow Jones Sustainability Index (DJSI).
Allianz has been one of the most sustainable companies in the insurance industry ever since 2000. Since then, the company has been an integral part of the investment universe of the well-known Dow Jones Sustainability Index. DJSI ranks companies according to environmental, social and governance (ESG) criteria, assessing their sustainability strategy and performance. “We are extremely proud of this result,” said Oliver Bäte, Chief Executive Officer of Allianz SE. “We started with the integration of ESG factors into our business early on and have continuously improved. We also set ambitious goals for the coming years and would like to contribute to the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals.”
Sustainability rankings such as the DJSI are important tools for Allianz to provide investors and stake-holders with transparency about the strategies and performance of corporate responsibility.
The DJSI is the world’s best-known sustainability index. Only the most sustainable companies of the 2,500 Dow Jones Global Total Stock Market Index (DJGTSM) are included. With this methodology, the DJSI combines the approaches of classical equity indices with purely ecology-oriented indices.
As a responsible investor, Allianz is also using sustainability ratings to manage its own funds and sustainably oriented investment products (SRI), which it offers to its asset management customers.
Since 2016, Allianz has published its group-wide ESG integration approach to provide ratings agencies, non-governmental organizations and other experts with a detailed overview of its ESG integration processes and guidelines. With these measures, Allianz established its position as a responsible insurance and financial services company.
