Prime Minister congratulates Premier Scott Morrison

Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe on Saturday congratulated new Prime Minister of Australia Scott Morrison on his election to the office.
Extending his best wishes to Morrison, the Premier said, “I have great pleasure in congratulating you on your election as Leader of the Liberal Party of Australia today and becoming the 30th Prime Minister of Australia. Your election is a manifestation of the confidence placed in your leadership qualities by your Party colleagues.
“Sri Lanka and Australia share a warm friendship and excellent cooperation on several areas of common interest. I recall with pleasure my visit to your beautiful country last year at the time of commemorating 70 years’ of diplomatic relations.
“Being a former Minister of Immigration and Border Protection who has visited Sri Lanka, you are personally aware of the close cooperation our two countries enjoy in this area. It is timely that we diversify this excellent cooperation to other areas of mutual benefit, as our governments have striven to do during recent high level contacts.
“I look forward with great pleasure to working with you to build on this friendship towards a more robust and mutually beneficial partnership.
“Please accept, Excellency, the assurances of my highest consideration and my personal best wishes.”
