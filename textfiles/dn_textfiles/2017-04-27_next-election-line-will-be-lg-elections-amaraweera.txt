Next election in line will be LG elections: Amaraweera

The country's next election which is to be held immediately, would not be a referendum, but Local Government Election, Fisheries and Aquatic Resources Development Minister Mahinda Amaraweera said. He said the Government would take every possible measure to hold LG elections with immediate effect, while there was no need in postponing it, he added.
“With the Meethotamulla disaster, it had been proved the need for having LG bodies functioning in the country. Having identified the need, the President advised the relevant Ministers and Government officials to take steps to hold LG elections promptly at the Central Committee meeting of the SLFP recently,” he further said.
Accordingly, the next election will be none other than the Local Government election, he said.
