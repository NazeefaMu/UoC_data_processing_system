Need for tripartism on labour issues highlighted

In 1994, Sri Lanka ratified the ILO Convention 144 which is a Tripartite Consultation. As a result, the National Labour Advisory Council was established in Sri Lanka, Labour and Trade Union Relations Minister W. D. J. Seneviratne said.
He was addressing a workshop on 'State of labour market governance in Sri Lanka' held in Colombo, recently.
We at the Ministry of Labour at intra-ministerial meetings and at the National Labour Advisory Council as well, have discussed the need for wider consultation and true tripartism. Sometimes, we take decisions at labour dialogue forums without consulting the real beneficiaries or parties concerned, the Minister said.
On the other hand, once the decision is taken, it could be implemented. The implementation ability depends on the strength of the tripartite dialogue.
Therefore, I think recognition has to be given to the social dialogue mechanism of the country, the Minister added.
According to Minister Seneviratne, this advisory council is the national tripartite consultative mechanism, (apex body), established to provide consultation and cooperation between the Government and the organizations of workers and employers at the national level on matters relating to social and labour policies and international labour standards.
Minister Seneviratne said, since then the NLAC was established, the Ministry of Labour had taken its efforts to discuss all labour-related national issues at the NLAC and to reach consensus. But we have observed that reaching consensus among three parties is difficult and a painful exercise.
