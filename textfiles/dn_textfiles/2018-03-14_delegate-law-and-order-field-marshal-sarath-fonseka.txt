Delegate Law and Order to Field Marshal Sarath Fonseka

Law and order, I believe, is the single most important factor that ensures the proper operation of democracy. Corruption, indiscipline and disruption of day-to-day functions have now reached intolerable levels. We are all completely aware of the parliament's (except for a very few members) conspiracy against the people of this country. There are only a very few who can be described as educated and gentlemen.
How can the government justify the misery it has brought upon all peace-loving citizens? May be their greed for luxury vehicles and extravagant sensuous living at the expense of the citizens, are their priorities. An honest, fearless and efficient person is needed to ensure that legal action against white collar criminals operates as it should, and to eliminate corruption and general social indiscipline.
There is hardly a better-qualified person than Field Marshal Sarath Fonseka to whom this task can be entrusted. That is from the point of view of the majority of honest hard working citizens. The guilty, may, of course, have a different view.
