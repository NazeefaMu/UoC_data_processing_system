‘All AS records should be in electronic format within next five years’

Members of the Sri Lanka Administrative Service should shift to keep all their records in electronic format within the next five years, adviser to the Media Ministry Piyathisss Ranaweera, said yesterday.
He was addressing the 34th Annual General Meeting of the Sri Lanka Administrative Service Association held at the Nelum Pokuna Mahinda Rajapaksa performing Art Theatre delivering a special lecture on the role of the executive offices in implementing the Right to Information Act
He said the executives of the public authority has a major role to play when the Right to Information Act is implemented as they have to guarantee the people's right to information.
He said the executives will have to preserve all the existing records for 10 years and the new ones for 12 years.
"This is not an easy task," Piyathissa said. "The digitalisation is the best option.
Therefore, all have to shift to the electronic format for keeping records within the next five years," he said.
