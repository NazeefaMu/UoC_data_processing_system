Special security arrangements for SL vs. India 4th ODI

 
Security will be beefed up at the 4th ODI between Sri Lanka and India at R. Premadasa Stadium Colombo tomorrow (31).
Police said close to 1,000 police personnel will be on duty at the venue and CCTV cameras will be operational throughout the game.
Police have been instructed to take adequate measures against those who violate order during the game.
Police also requested the public to refrain from disruptive behavior throughout the game.
During the 3rd ODI at Pallekele irate fans threw bottles onto the field causing play to be halted for close to 45 minutes.
