Fines for child labour exploiters to go up

Fines for those who engage children in child labour will be increased to Rs. 25,000, Labour and Trade Unions Relations Minister John Seneviratne said.
He was addressing the media at the Global Towers, Colombo yesterday.
The minister said stringent laws should be in place to eliminate child labour. “Sri Lanka is heading towards a child labour free country. The fines should be increased to achieve this end," he said.
Minister Seneviratne said children between 15 -17 ages are being used for drug smuggling in Colombo.
“We are investigating the issue. Measures will be taken to prevent children being engaged in similar activities," he said.
He said Sri Lanka agreed to eliminate child labour at the Global Child Labour Conference in 2010 held at Hague, the Netherlands. Meanwhile, there has been a decrease in use of child labour over the past few years indicating Sri Lanka’s ability of eliminating child labour, he said.
“Sri Lanka’s efforts to eliminate child labour have been successful according to the recently launched Child Activity Survey 2016 by the Department of Census and Statistics (DCS). The report shows a low level of child labour which has been estimated as one percent of the child population," Minister Seneviratne said.
