One Nation, Many Gods

The Cabinet of Ministers issued an unusual statement recently. I am highlighting several passages including –“ensure that our nation never again returns to a conflict-ridden past, communal, ethnic and religious hatred and violence, and impunity have no place in the society that we strive to build, deeply concerned by the recent incidents of violence targeting places of religious worship, shops and business enterprises, and houses, denounce in the strongest terms, these acts of violence and hatred, including incidents of hate speech by certain individuals and groups aimed at inciting violence against the different ethnic and religious communities, direct the law enforcement authorities to immediately take all necessary steps in accordance with the law of the land, against instigators and perpetrators of violence and hate speech targeting any religious and ethnic groups in the country, deep appreciation to civil society and religious leaders who have stepped up to counter the attempts of a few to spread hate in our country, and who have called for calm and peaceful co-existence, nation is blessed by the teachings of the four great religious traditions in the world – Buddhism, Hinduism, Christianity, and Islam – which provide us the guidance required for peaceful co-existence, upholding human values, and honest and hard work required to rebuild our nation as one of the most progressive in the region”.
Religious tension
The Prime Minister said separately, “reminding the country about the violence and destruction that was caused by religious tension in 2014, the country would not face such a situation again. We do not want to stoop to such low levels. We will not permit such action again.”.
The Anglican Bishop added, “the government also ignores such provocative acts at its own peril. If it does not send a clear message to the country that it will not tolerate hate crimes against any group, it is paving the way for its own demise as well as leaving the door open to another prolonged period of religious and ethnic strife, economic stagnation and international opprobrium. It is also the duty of all religious groups to actively promote the peaceful resolution of differences and misunderstandings. This is the minimum that we owe our country and its people for the common good of all”.
The National Christian Council of Sri Lanka, went onto say. “We reiterate the fact that Christian churches have been subject to violence, intimidation and threats over the past few years. We are of the opinion that the current crisis, which has been precipitated through TV debates and pronouncements of politicians, is only trying to deal with the visible wounds and symptoms of a problem without trying to address the root causes.”
The President has followed with a Cabinet paper that establishes District Level Reconciliation Committees to address incidence of inter-religious and inter-ethnic tensions and to promote national integration and reconciliation in all 25 districts with a broad remit of functions.
Advancing a vision for religious freedom
If we are serious about freedom of religion we have to understand an attack on one faith is an attack on all our faiths. And when any religious group is targeted, we all have a responsibility to speak up. We have to reject a politics that seeks to manipulate prejudice or bias, and targets people because of religion. We have to be consistent in condemning hateful rhetoric and violence against everyone.
How can intolerance be countered globally?
1. Fighting intolerance requires law:
Each Government is responsible for enforcing human rights laws, for banning and punishing hate crimes and discrimination against minorities, whether these are committed by State officials, private organisations or individuals so that people do not take justice into their own hands and resort to violence to settle their disputes.
2. Fighting intolerance requires education:
Intolerance is very often rooted in ignorance and fear: fear of the unknown, of the other, other cultures, nations, religions. Intolerance is also closely linked to an exaggerated sense of self-worth and pride, whether personal, national or religious. These notions are taught and learned at an early age. Education is a life-long experience and does not begin or end in school. Endeavours to build tolerance through education will not succeed unless they reach all age groups, and take place everywhere: at home, in schools, in the workplace, in law-enforcement and legal training, and not least in entertainment and on the information highways.
3. Fighting intolerance requires access to information:
Intolerance is most dangerous when it is exploited to fulfil the political and territorial ambitions of an individual or groups of individuals. Hatemongers often begin by identifying the public's tolerance threshold. They then develop fallacious arguments, lie with statistics and manipulate public opinion with misinformation and prejudice.
4. Fighting intolerance requires individual awareness:
Intolerance in a society is the sum-total of the intolerance of its individual members. In order to fight intolerance individuals should become aware of the link between their behaviour and the vicious cycle of mistrust and violence in society.
5. Fighting intolerance requires local solutions:
Many people know that tomorrow's problems will be increasingly global but few realize that solutions to global problems are mainly local, even individual. When confronted with an escalation of intolerance around us, we must not wait for governments and institutions to act alone. We are all part of the solution.
