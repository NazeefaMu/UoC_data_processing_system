The Pet Scanner bought with public funds collected with the assistance of the Kadijah Foundation and a number of other organisations and persons etc will be provided to the National Institute of Cancer in Maharagama in Januray, Health Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne said. According to Minister Senaratne, the Pet Scanner which is made in Germany will be given to the hospital in Januray, next year.
"The tender procedure of the Health Ministry took 9 to 15 months which is a long time. Another company submitted an appeal, but,now the machine has been ordered," the Minister said.
The public donated Rs.200 million to the Government to purchase the PET Scanner for the National Institute of Cancer in Maharagama. The fund raising campaign was implemented by Kadijah Foundation and several other organisations, individuals etc. The fund raising campaign was completed in June last year (2016).
Positron Emission Tomography (PET) is a nuclear medicine functional imaging technique that is used to observe metabolic processes in the body.
Three-dimensional images of tracer concentration within the body are then constructed by computer analysis.
PET Scans assist oncologists immensely to determine the latest status of cancers in patients bodies.
