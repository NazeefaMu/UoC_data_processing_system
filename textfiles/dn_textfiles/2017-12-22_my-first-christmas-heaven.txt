My first Christmas in heaven

I am having my first Christmas in heaven
A glorious, wonderful day!
I am standing with saints and
departed souls of all ages,
Who found baby Christ- the truth and the way
I am singing with the heavenly choir
As I loved singing praises to our King Jesus!
And, oh what a cherished music
We sing and praise our Saviour and King in heaven
I am singing the glad song of redemption,
How Jesus was born in Bethlehem,
And why they called His name Jesus,
That all may be saved through His Name!
Oh, loved one, I wish you could be here!
No Christmas on earth can ever compare,
With all of the rapture in glory,
I witnessed my first Christmas in heaven so fair
You know how I always loved Christmas,
It seemed such a wonderful day,
With all of my loved ones departed around me,
We were so happy meeting them every day.
Yes, now I can see why I loved it,
And, oh what a joy it will be,
When all of my loved ones are with me,
To share all the glories of true Christmas I see!
So, dear ones on earth, I send my greetings,
Look up! Until dawn appears
And, oh what a Christmas awaits for us,
Beyond all our sorrows and tears!
