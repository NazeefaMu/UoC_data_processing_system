Registration, a requirement

The Consumers’ Affairs Authority (CAA) has instructed all manufacturers of Buddhist flags and atapirikara to get registered with the Buddhist Affairs Department. This is a now compulsory.
The CAA has informed all such manufacturers that they should display their names, addresses, maximum retail price, TP nos., and date of manufacture on the wrappers clearly for the buyers’ knowledge.
CAA Chairman Hasitha Thilakaratne told the Daily News that those who sell low-quality Buddhist flags and atapirikara to consumers would be booked. To nab such wrongdoers, about 700 investigation officers would be deployed by the CAA, he said.
All dansalas that are proposed to be held for the Vesak festival too have to get registered with the relevant MOH office of that area. Raids would be held during Vesak to nab those who offer unfit drinks and food to the devotees.
About 1,800 PHIs would be deployed for inspecting dansalas this year,” said All Sri Lanka PHIs’ Association Secretary Mahendra Balasooriya when he was contacted by the Daily News yesterday.
