SLTIP becomes most visited gateway

Sri Lanka’s Trade Information Portal (TIP), the government’s major initiative on cross-border trade information that complies with the World Trade Organization (WTO) has stunned world trade circles by garnering the highest validation of data accuracy so far seen on any World Bank assisted info-portal.
SLTIP was launched by the Minister of Industry and Commerce Rishad Bathiudeen on July 20, 2018. Addressing the launch, Minister Bathiudeen said: “With the operation of the Sri Lanka Trade Information Portal, our business community and other stakeholders will be provided with a useful tool to find the info necessary to facilitate their cross-border trade and import-export.”
By its launch in 2018 July, 204 Non-Tariff Measures were identified; closely analysed and 207 related procedures were integrated. 252 forms related to procedures were identified and 269 legal documents with details of legislative background to the measures too were identified. At the time of its launch, 98.8% of the total content of SLTIP had been validated making it the highest validated TIP to be developed by the World Bank to-date. SLTIP reached a total of 10,071 visitors including 33,486 page views within the first two months of its launch, which is also the highest number of visitors attracted by any World Bank assisted Trade Information Portal.
