Bond Commission report release
AG’s determination sent to Speaker

The Attorney General (AG) has advised against releasing the full report of the Bond Commission report stating that publication of some annexes in it may be prejudicial to several on-going cases, Parliamentary sources said.
Secretary to the President Austin Fernando told the Daily News yesterday that he sent the two reply letters received from the Attorney General to Speaker Karu Jayasuriya.
“The Secretary sought the legal opinion of the AG to hand over the full report of Presidential Commission of Inquiry into the questionable Bond transactions to Parliament following a written request by the Speaker. Following the receipt of C350-C360 pages of the report on June 5,” the Speaker told the House that he awaits the full report to be tabled in the House.
According to sources, the AG, while advising against revealing case sensitive information, has not objected to releasing other information in its annexes subject to the permission of relevant institutions such as the Central Bank.
