Art and jewellery entwined

was recently responsible for yet another unforgettable experience when the brand teamed up with Kavan Balasuriya, one of the rising stars of the local art scene.
The collaboration saw Alankara use Kavan’s work as backdrops for jewelry display cases, as well as miniature display pedestals, at the pop up gallery at their shop in Odel Unlimited at Alexander place, Colombo 7. The pop up gallery caught the eye of jewelry and art connoisseurs alike.
Having graduated from the BA Fine Art course at Central Saint Martin’s College of Art and Design, University of the Arts, London, in 2014, Kavan now lives and works in Colombo where he has already held several exhibitions.
Director of Alankara, Roshini Sangani said “We believe that it is vitally important for companies to support local artists. We were particularly interested in Kavan since his penchant for strong lines and textures that challenge space and form, made for ideal backdrops for our trademark classic jewelry.”
The alternative gallery attracted many visitors. Speaking about the experience Kavan said “This was an excellent opportunity, and I was delighted when Alankara approached me with the concept. Our country is rich in artistic talent, and all we artists need is exposure and encouragement”.
Alankara’s hope is that as the public becomes more exposed to the local art scene, more brands will seize the opportunity to align with these talented individuals “There is so much talent out there and these artists deserve all the support we can give them.We will continue to work with these creative young people and we hope that other brands and companies will follow suit,” Sangani said.
