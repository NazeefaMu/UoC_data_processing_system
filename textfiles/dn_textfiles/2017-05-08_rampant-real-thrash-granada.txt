Rampant Real thrash Granada

BARCELONA, Saturday - Real Madrid produced a ruthless first-half display to thrash already-relegated Granada 4-0 on Saturday and remain on course for a first league title in five years, while Barcelona hammered Villarreal 4-1.
James Rodriguez put Zinedine Zidane's side in charge in the third minute by bundling in Lucas Vazquez's arrowed cross and then headed in a cross from forgotten man Fabio Coentrao to double their lead in the 11th, scoring for the fifth time in four games.
Alvaro Morata followed the Colombian's early strikes with two goals of his own in the 30th and 35th to kill off Tony Adams's sunken side and put Real level on 84 points with champions Barca.
“Every opponent gives you a difficult game but we started the game really well and scored early,” said Morata.
“We've got difficult games to come but we're very good, we have 24 players that always want to play and we need to keep going like this and go for the league title.” Barca lead the standings due to their superior head-to-head record although Real have a game in hand and will win a first domestic title since 2012 if they take seven points from their remaining three games.
Real could also win a league and European Cup double for the first time since 1958 as they are 3-0 up in their Champions League semi-final tie with Atletico Madrid, with the second leg taking place on Wednesday. Barca's formidable front three of Lionel Messi, Luis Suarez and Neymar all scored as the champions inflicted the heaviest league defeat of the season on Villarreal, who have the second best defensive record in Spain's top flight.
Neymar was in sensational form in his second game back from suspension and nudged Barcelona ahead in the 21st minute after pouncing on a deflected pass from Messi. Cedric Bakambu fired Villarreal level in the 32nd after beating the offside trap to latch on to a clever through ball from Roberto Soldado. – Agencies
