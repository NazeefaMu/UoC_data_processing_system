Amaranthé Bay a popular choice for MICE events

Amaranthé Bay Resort and Spa, the new small luxury resort located in the idyllic fishing village of Uppuveli, north of Trincomalee, is fast becoming a popular venue for residential conferences, workshops and seminars. The resort is being sought after for such events due to its secluded location and natural setting amid coconut and palmyrah groves.
The UN agency, Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), brokered the adoption by its member countries of the ‘Port State Measures Agreement’ (PSMA) to Prevent, Deter and Eliminate Illegal, Unreported and Unregulated Fishing’, which came in to force in June 2016.
The latest event at the Amaranthé Bay was two training courses held for officers from the Department of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources and the Sri Lanka Navy and Coast Guard, as a follow up to coming in to force of the agreement to deter illegal and unregulated fishing.
The two training courses held during the first half of June was attended by 36 officers. One group took part in the implementation of the PSMA and the other on Basic Nautical Knowledge.
The fisheries officers came from Batticaloa, Jaffna, Kalmunai, Mannar, Mulalaitivu, Negombo and Trincomalee, while the Sri Lanka Navy and Coast Guard officers came from the Northern and Eastern Command Operations.
The purpose of the training was to strengthen Sri Lanka’s capacity to implement its international obligations in carrying out inspections of fishing and fish transport vessels. The training course was a full residential course and the Amaranthé Bay provided conference and secretarial facilities, and full board and lodging for the participants in addition to 6 trainers.
With the coming in to force of PSMA, all coastal states are now obliged to carry out inspections of foreign fishing and fish transport vessels that wish to load, offload or receive port services.
Amaranthé Bay, which won two Trip Advisor commendations within a short space of two years of its operation, has once again been awarded ‘2017 Certificate of Excellence’ this month by tripadvisor.
