Construction Expo to promote new  trends, technology developments

Green building will be the core message of Construction Expo 2017, Sri Lanka's premier trade exhibition in the construction sector. Construction Expo 2017 showcasing every aspect related to the construction and building industry will be held on June 2, 3 and 4, at the BMICH.
“Towards a Green Sri Lanka, will be our theme of this time around and Lean Construction methodology that sheds light on eliminating wastage of resources in construction processes will be introduced parallel to this,” said Ceylon Institute of Builders (CIOB) Chairman, Dr. Rohan Karunaratne at a press conference held in Colombo.
“Construction sector has weathered storms to revive. Construction Expo 2017 would promote new trends and technology developments in the sector. We introduce green and sustainable construction methodology and trade related material via this exhibition,” Dr. Karunaratne added.
He said CIOB has contributed to major projects in the country such as Megapolis, China Harbour and also towards entities such as NSBM University.
State Minister of Finance, Lakshman Yapa Abeyawardena gracing the occasion as the chief guest said that CIOB is an entity brought innovation to the country's construction sphere.
“Construction sphere in the Asian region is thriving now and our experts are playing a significant role in this international arena. Green oriented and sustainable lean constructions are the need of the day. Thus an integrated approach is being adapted locally to add value to the sphere”, said the minister.
“Contribution from the construction sphere towards the GDP was 7.2 percent in 2014. It was dropped to 6.8 percent in 2015 due to changing political scenario. Yet it has grown to 6.9 percent by the third quarter of 2016 and is on an upward trend now. We have forecast a GDP contribution of 12 percent from the construction sphere in 2017,” he added.
Construction Expo 2017 would attract around 15,000 to 20,000 visitors and benefit contractors, architects, quantity surveyors, engineers and other related parties in the sector. Construction industry specialists from China, Singapore, Malaysia, UK and Japan too will be exhibiting their latest trends and technologies like in the previous year.
Profile of exhibit is based on Construction Suppliers, Construction Equipment, Construction Machinery, Construction Technology, Construction Material, Construction Service, Building Material, Building Supplies, Building Developing Service, Building Machinery, Building Equipment, Cement, Sand, Brick and Plywood.
