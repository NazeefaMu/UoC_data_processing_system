Thieves steal offerings to deities

Two men who entered a famous kovil in the Chilaw area recently one night and stole antique coins and gold ornaments offered by devotees to the deities, were arrested by the Chilaw Police, led by OIC IP Wasantha Herath.
The guardian of the kovil had complained to the police about the theft on August 3. The estimated value of the stolen articles is Rs.180,000.
The suspects were found to be drug addicts and were apprehended after the temple’s CCTV cameras were scanned.
