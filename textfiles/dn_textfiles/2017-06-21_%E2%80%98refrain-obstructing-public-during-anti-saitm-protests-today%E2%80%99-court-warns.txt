‘Refrain from obstructing public during anti- SAITM protests today’: Court warns IUSF

 
The Colombo Fort Magistrate Court ordered the Inter University Students Federation (IUSF) to refrain from obstructing the public during their scheduled protest against SAITM today.
The Court also made an order preventing the IUSF from entering the Presidential Secretariat office forcibly.
The Inter University Students Federation is protesting the South Asian Institute of Technology and Medicine and is insisting the campus is shut down.
