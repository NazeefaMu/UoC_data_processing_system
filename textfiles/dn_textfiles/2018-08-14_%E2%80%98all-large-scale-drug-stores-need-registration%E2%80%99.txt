‘All large-scale drug stores need registration’

All large-scale drug stores should register with the Health Ministry under the private pharmacies category, Health Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne instructed.
Minister Senaratne said doctors often keep drug stocks for the use of their private dispensaries and such drug storage should be registered as pharmacies. It is illegal to store large stocks of drugs. The National Medicines Regulatory Authority (NMRA) will commence raids in this regard, he said.
The minister said private pharmacy owners complain about large stocks of drugs kept by doctors.
A decision was made to provide training for staffers attached to private pharmacies. A special programme is launched to train more pharmacists as there is a shortage in the country at present, the minister said.
