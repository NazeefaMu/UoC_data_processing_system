Elgar holds firm against England after Amla blow

LONDON July7: South Africa captain Dean Elgar showed he too could lead from the front as he dug in to make an unbeaten fifty on the second day of the first Test against England at Lord’s on Friday.
But the Proteas lost star batsman Hashim Amla for 29 and at tea were 96 for two in reply to England’s first innings 458 -- a deficit of 362 runs.
Elgar was 54 not out and JP Duminy eight not out.
Both Elgar and England skipper Joe Root, who made a commanding 190 earlier Friday, were leading their respective countries in a Test for the first time.
But Elgar’s appointment appears to be temporary given regular Proteas captain Faf du Plessis is expected back for next week’s second Test of this four-Test series in Nottingham, after missing the opener to be with his wife following the birth of their first child. AFP
