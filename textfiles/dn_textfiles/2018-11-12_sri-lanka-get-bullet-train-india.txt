Sri Lanka to get bullet-like train from India

India’s Integral Coach Factory (ICF), its premier coach manufacturing unit, has rolled out a special rake of diesel electric multiple unit (DEMU) with an aerodynamic nose and rotatable seats akin to Train-18 for Sri Lanka.
The unit is ready to be shipped to Sri Lanka, the Times of India cited sources as saying, in a Chennai datelined report.
The train can travel at a maximum speed of 100kmph and can accommodate around 800 passengers.
Considering the highly corrosive environment in Sri Lanka, the DEMU trains have been designed with anticorrosive features using a special paint and a greater amount of stainless steel in the body, an ICF official said. Six such rakes will roll out.
The DEMU is powered with an 1800HP onboard engine with a three-phase AC transmission system that requires less maintenance.
Each DEMU rake will consist of 13 cars in a combination of two driving power cars with economy class seating (DPC), two driving trailer cars with economy class seating (DTC), two air-conditioned chair cars, two business class chair cars, and five economy class coaches.
