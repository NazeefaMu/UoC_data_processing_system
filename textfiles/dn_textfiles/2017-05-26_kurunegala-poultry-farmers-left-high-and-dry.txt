Kurunegala poultry farmers left high and dry

Poultry farmers in the Kurunegala District complain that the price of eggs is decreasing rapidly these days and that they are being forced to close down their poultry farms due to the frequent losses.
They are unable to maintain the self-employment avenue of poultry farming profitably as the prices of veterinary drugs and relevant services, labour charges and high cost of poultry feed are increasing daily.
The wholesale price of an egg is now Rs. eight. Last week, it was Rs. 11. Consequently, a daily loss of Rs. 15,000 is incurred by small scale poultry farmers at present.
There are nearly 48,000 small scale poultry farmers in Kurunegala and Puttalam Districts. All are engaging in this industry as a source of self-employment.
However, the assistance and attention towards them by the Ministries of Agriculture and Rural Economic Development are insufficient, farmers said. If the government fails to address the grievances of these farmers soon, this industry will collapse, depriving the livelihoods of thousands of low income families in the NWP,” said President of the Kurunegala District Poultry Farmers’ Co-Operative Society S. M. Premaratne.
