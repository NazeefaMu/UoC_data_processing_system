Opening doors for french speakers

Alliance Francaise is one institute that offers Sri Lankan students an exciting and fulfilling future. It is an institute that offers lucrative opportunities for growth and attractive job prospects. With the new Director of Alliance Francaise de Kotte Francis Cappe, assuming his duties last September, Alliance Francaise met media personalities to upgrade the public on the good reasons to learn French.
“I have two points to emphasize and one point to clarify. Sri Lanka has entered the tourism age. In 2016 the number of French tourists visiting the country was more than 100,000. And we feel that there will be much more in coming years. So the French government has recognized Sri Lanka’s potential. We expect the number of French tourists to reach the number of 200,000 in 2020. So Sri Lanka will be in need of French speaking guides. The Alliance Francaise network in Sri Lanka which includes Kotte, Matale, Kandy and Jaffna is very much key to developing French speaking guides,” said Ambassador of France to Sri Lanka and the Maldives, Jean –Marin Schuh.
Schuh mentioned that since Sri Lanka is developing fast, there are more students eager to go to foreign countries with this development.
“In France we are extremely eager to receive more Sri Lankan students. The Alliance Francaise network is the entry gate for this. We offer courses for future Sri Lankan students to study in France. We believe that in France we have a big advantage compared to other countries. The University studies are strongly subsidized by French tax payers. Which means the studies are quite cheap. This is because it is highly subsidized. It is the same price for French and Foreign students,” stated Schuh
Schuh mentioned that they are most eager to welcome Sri Lankan students.
President of Alliance Francaise de Kotte, Chandra Wickramasinghe, mentioned that just after independence that there were three European Cultural institutes started in Sri Lanka.
“They were the British Council promoting cultural relationships between Britain and Sri Lanka. Then there was the Allliance Francaise and the German cultural institute. So we have a very long history with the Alliance Francaise. The contribution of the Alliance Francaise to the Sri Lankan tourism economy is enormous,” said Wickramasinghe.
Wickramasinghe mentioned that the Francophone Entrepreneurs produced thanks to Alliance Francaise is commendable.
“Commendable in the sense, we have in Sri Lanka about 20 to 25 travel agents, ex- students of Alliance Francaise and they are running those travel agencies very well. And most of them speak very good French. More and more French speaking Entrepreneurs are investing here on travel as well as hotels. So even myself, I started my own company in the 1980’s and it is thanks to the French knowledge I obtained from this institution. So Alliance Francaise has done a lot for Sri Lanka. So French tourists are looking for Francophone travel agencies and we need guides,” pointed out Wickramasinghe.
In 2010, we had only 30,000 French people coming to Sri Lanka. Now we have 100,000 French tourists. So this is a market that is really thriving. So we need so many French speaking staff in Sri Lanka. So we have excellent teachers at Alliance Francaise and they are doing a remarkable job.
“So we can employ these students without any hesitation from his institute.
They can write and talk and be excellent guides and be travel executives,” added Wickramasinghe.
