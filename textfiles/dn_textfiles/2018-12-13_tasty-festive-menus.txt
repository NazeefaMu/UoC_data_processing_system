Tasty  festive menus

Tasty Caterers is celebrating its 37th anniversary this year by introducing a new range of enticing menus fit for the occasion, and season.
To commemorate this milestone, as well as the coming of the festive season, Tasty has designed a delectable selection of take-out and catering menus, allowing you to make the most of the holiday by spending less time in the kitchen and more with your loved ones.
The Festive Finger Food Cocktail Menu offers an assortment of scrumptious finger food, crisps and dips, and special sweet goodies, perfect for a casual cocktail.
Tasty offers an exquisite array of specially curated menus including soups, salads, appetizers, mains, and desserts from the a la carte Seasonal Take Away Menu.
Customers preferring to opt out of any serious decision making however, can choose from one of three festive set menus: Seasonal Indulgence, the Christmas Classic, and the Tasty Premium Festive Menu. Each offering a grand selection of meat, seafood, and even vegetarian entrees -with all the trimmings-Tasty’s three festive set menus are all accompanied with a selection of resplendent salads, and savoury starches and sides, to be finished off with a mouth-watering choice of decadent desserts.
From authentic Mediterranean fare to taste bud-tingling Thai food, from comforting Sri Lankan rice and curry to delectable patisseries, together, the Tasty outlets offer up a variety of cuisines like no other. Patrons are even spoilt for choice when opting for an ambience to suit a particular occasion.
“From the very beginning, Tasty Caterers has stood out in its commitment to serving a variety of exceptional cuisine,” said founder of Tasty Caterers Kanthi Jayamaha.
As synonymous with reliability as it is with quality fare, Tasty has more popularly established its name as the trusted outdoor caterer for both small and large-scale events. A selection of customised menus for special occasions of all kinds can satisfy the stomachs of 25 to as many as 2,000 people at a time.
Although Tasty’s special festive menus will be taking the spotlight this season, patrons will be pleased to know that the catering outfit will still be taking orders for their ever-popular old favourites, namely the Sri Lankan Glory menu, Celebrations menu, International menu, Singaporean Fusion menu, Thai menu, Western menu, and the Mongolian BBQ menu. In addition, orders will still be taken from the many options of Cocktail, Fusion, and Short Eats menus.
Understanding that each high tea, cocktail and dinner is unique, the newly expanded Tasty sales and marketing team is always flexible in accommodating special requests.
