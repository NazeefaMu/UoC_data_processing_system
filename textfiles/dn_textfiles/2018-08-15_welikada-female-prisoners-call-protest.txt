Welikada female prisoners call off protest

Female prison inmates of the Welkada Prison yesterday called off their protest following a discussion with Justice and Prison Reforms Ministry officials last night.
The female prison inmates had got onto the prison roof and staged a protest from Tuesday morning against the decision taken by the prison authorities to limit their food items allowed to be brought from outside and demanding that their cases be taken up for hearing early.
A group of Ministry officials had arrived at the prison premises yesterday evening and told the inmates on the roof top that they would not discuss their grievances,if they continue to strike.
The female prison inmates who were on the roof top decided to call off their protest as Ministry officials promised to discuss their issues.
