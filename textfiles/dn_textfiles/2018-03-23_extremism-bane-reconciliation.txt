Extremism, a bane for reconciliation

The State of Emergency has been lifted. Normalcy has been restored, it is said. The electronic media shows visuals of citizens going about for their day-to-day activities leisurely. Is that normalcy? How does one know the anxieties and phobias they entertain in their hearts – their fear of the immediate future?
No, normalcy is not going back to the pre-March 2018 status quo. That status-quo ante was charged with communal tension that two untoward incidents could unleash a mob attack on peacefully living hapless Muslims. Nor could it be the situation since the Gintota clashes or for that matter, ever since the Aluthgama incidents in which the BBS played a lead role with patronage from powerful politicos.
Not only is the present situation not normal it is pregnant with new dangers. Embers of communal flames lie beneath the ashes. A close look at the media or reading between the lines one could discern apologists of majoritarian forces meekly weaving new theories to justify majoritarian backlashes against minorities in general and suggesting the relevance of such theories to the recent clashes in Kandy.
Socio-economic development
They say that Muslims in Sri Lanka are a privileged minority with enviable economic strength vis- a-vis the Sinhala Buddhists whose patience has reached its limit. The contrary is the truth. Though there are wealthy and educated elements the majority of the Muslim community remains poor and backward. They have reached even the present progress due to affirmative actions by past governments to improve their lot.
A hullabaloo is created over the birth rate of Muslims. It is said that at present birth rates the Muslims would outnumber the Sinhala people in the near future. Statistics claim otherwise. It is true that the birth rate among the Muslims is greater than among the Sinhala population. But there are 75 Sinhala people for every 9 or 10 Muslims. Hence there is no danger of the Muslims overtaking the Sinhala people in the foreseeable future. Besides a high birth rate is a sign of under-development.
The birth rate among the Sinhala people was also much higher several decades ago. It came down subsequent to girls pursuing secondary and tertiary education and taking up employment. With their socio-economic development, particularly education, birth rate among the Muslim community would surely come down. We must understand that economic compulsions are more forceful than religious beliefs or practices. Moreover, the overall birth rate in Sri Lanka is also in the decline.
Some persons, including well-meaning ones have described the Ampara and Digana incidents as communal clashes. However, it is inappropriate to do so because no two sides clashed with each other but one side, the aggressor Sinhala Buddhist mob attacked the unarmed Muslims who had no means of defence. To identify the clashes as a communal is to minimize the crime committed by the aggressor.
There was also talk of extremists on both sides. It was first spoken of by the Bodu Bala Sena and later echoed by others.
The repeated silence of the Muslims amidst consecutive attacks shows that extremism has not taken root among the community. However, this does not mean that there are no isolated individuals with extreme positions. Some including the BBS have identified Wahabism as an extremist trend. But Wahabists are a small minority and are engaged in a sectarian religious struggle against Muslims. They have not come out politically against non-Muslims. Nor have political parties embraced Wahabism.
In case attacks against Muslims continue unabated they could become a militant political movement. In the context of the existence of widespread Islamic fundamentalist groups throughout the word, including South Asia the consequences of some of them entering Sri Lanka would be horrendous.
Like Iraq or Syria our country too could become a battleground for world powers that would ultimately partition it among themselves. The only way to prevent such a calamity is to fortify national unity among all communities denying foreign powers any opportunity to intervene. Hence those politicians who in the name of race, religion or anti-imperialism pursue communal politics are real traitors. One positive development in the present moment is the large number of Sinhala Buddhists, including members of the Maha Sangha who rose to the occasion and defended the Muslim brethren facing the ire of the communalist forces. Communalism among the majority community has certainly decreased comparatively.
Political parties based on race and religion
However, communalist and tribal sentiments are being disseminated by interested groups and the ordinary people are liable to be misled. That is an uphill task. In addition to awareness campaigns to enlighten the masses structural changes are also required. For example, it is necessary to do away with racial segregated schools and settlements. Political parties based on race and religion are also a bane. A national land alienation and utilization policy giving priority to local residents is also an urgent necessity. Domains of religion and State should not overlap though religious freedom including the rights of believers, practitioners and leaders of religions to take up political positions should be guaranteed and respected.
It would be also advisable for the government to declare a National Unity Day and celebrate it appropriately. Setting up ethnic and religious unity committees in every mixed village or settlement would be of assistance in preventing Digana type attacks.
Not a single person has been so far punished under the law for the attacks at Aluthgama and Gintota. The Government and the law enforcement authorities have failed miserably. This has resulted in a virtual impunity for racist offenders. Equality before the law has become a myth. This state of affairs is part of the status quo. It should change for a return to normalcy.
Former President has said that here are only two types of people in the country - those who love the country –patriots and those who do not- traitors. Well said. However, those who love the country would obey the rule of law. They would not steal or misappropriate public property. They would never resort to bribery and corruption. No would they disturb communal and religious harmony.
