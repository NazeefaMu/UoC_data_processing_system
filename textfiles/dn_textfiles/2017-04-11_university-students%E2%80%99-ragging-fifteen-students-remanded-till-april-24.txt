University students’ ragging: Fifteen students remanded till April 24

 
The fifteen Agriculture faculty students taken into custody for ragging eight fresheners of the Peradeniya University were further remanded till April 24, today.
The order was issued by Kandy Magistrate Gihan Indika Aththanayaka, who rejected the bail application filed by their lawyer.
The fifteen students were arrested on February 20 by the Peradeniya Police after receiving a tip-off that the eight students were taken to be ragged in a house in Megodakalugamuwa rented out by the gang for Rs. 10,000.
