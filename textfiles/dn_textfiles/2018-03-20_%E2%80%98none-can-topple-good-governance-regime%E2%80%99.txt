‘None can topple Good Governance regime’

Former President Mahinda Rajapaksa recently told foreign media that the government would fall. It is not an easy task to topple the Good Governance regime, Rural Economy Minister P. Harrison said.
He was addressing Nachchaduwa farmers following the distribution of agricultural appliances worth Rs. 50 million under the Ministry's Rural Economic Development Programme.
Referring to the No Confidence Motion against Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe, Harrison said that no UNP parliamentarian had signed it; only 40 Opposition members had signed it. They do not have majority to win, the Minister added.
"Science, Technology and Research Minister Susil Premajayantha and Lands State Minister T. B. Ekanayake supported the No Confidence Motion proposal. We are a national government supported by a number of political parties and we cannot act against anyone who opposes the government, while being in the government," the Minister said.
"We are expected to work jointly and in unity. It would be more respectable to leave the government before criticising it or put forward one's stand over any issue. It is shameful to work against the government, while being under its shelter," Minister Harrison added.
The Minister said the government did not allow or support former Central Bank Governor Arjuna Mahendran to flee the country. It is the duty of the judiciary to deal with the issues. The judiciary should have cancelled his passport in order to prevent him from leaving the country. It is unjust to blame the government.
The Minister said similar to the Red Notice issued for the arrest of former Sri Lankan Ambassador to Russia Udayanga Weeratunga, the same had been issued for Arjuna Mahendran. The law is common to every citizen without any discrimination, he said.
Minister Harrison said proposed three-judge bench High Court was not aimed at a particular party or individual.
The proposed judge bench would punish any individual being convicted. The government had held a discussion to establish a new judiciary, he said.
