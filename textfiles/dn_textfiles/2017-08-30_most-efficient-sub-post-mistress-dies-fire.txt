Most efficient Sub Post Mistress dies in fire

Elpitiya Police investigating the fire at the Kurundugahahetepma Sub Post Office which killed Post Mistress A. K. R. Kanchanamala de Silva on August 29 morning is trying to ascertain whether it was caused by an act of arson or an electrical short circuit.
Kanchanamala who was adjudged the best and most efficient Sub Post Mistress in the country in 2009 for her devotion to duty and social service also maintains an ANCL newspaper agency adjacent to the post office.
Reports said that Kanchanamala who is also a dutiful housewife, after finishing her domestic chores such as attending to the needs of her husband who is attached to the Ambalangoda UC and her daughter Dileesha a year 13 student of Dharmasoka Vidyalaya and son Sachin Randuka, had left for her post office cum business premises as usual to start work at the post office after a glance at the preparations of her newspaper agency.
However, an hour after she left home family members had received information that the sub post office was on fire.
As they rushed to the scene, neighbours were seen desperately trying everything within their means to douse the fire which engulfed the entire premises housing the sub post office and the newspaper agency. All they could see was the burnt body of Kanchanamala lying among the burning embers. Although she was rushed to the Elpitiya hospital she had succumbed to her burn injuries.
Her husband Clancy Danniston de Silva had visited the Elpitiya hospital to take charge of her body.
A large gathering of mourners and awe struck people were seen at de Silva’s residence situated a kilometre away from the sub post office premises with employees of the Ambalangoda UC including officials attending to the funeral arrangements.
Police had cordoned off the area around the sub post office and the business premises reduced to ashes.
