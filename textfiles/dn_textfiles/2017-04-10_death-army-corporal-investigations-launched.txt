Death of army corporal : Investigations launched

Kekirawa Police have launched investigations into the death of an Army corporal who is said to have committed suicide by hanging himself while on duty at a residence of a Major General at Kandana recently. This follows a complaint made to Kekirawa Police by the corporal’s parents that they entertained suspicions about the real cause of death.
The corporal’s father had stated in their complaint that an army team arrived at their house in Kekirawa on April 6 and informed that their son had been admitted to Ragama Hospital following a motor accident. The team took him and two others with them to visit the son in the hospital. But without going to the hospital, they were taken to an army camp at Ragama and told that the son had committed suicide. The Major General thereafter advised them to take the body home without creating an incident.
D.S.K. Seneviratne, a brother of the deceased, alleged that when they went to Kandana Police station to lodge a complaint about the indignity faced by them at the Ragama hospital, an officer connected him to the phone to a person identified as a coroner and the person at the other end threatened to file legal action against them for disrespecting court orders. So they brought the body to Kekirawa without lodging any complaint.
The mother of the deceased said her son had no personal problems to end his life this way.
Kekiriawa Police has provided security to the house where the corporal’s body is kept and re-started investigations to the death after reporting the matter to court.
Following a magisterial inquiry at the house on April 8 night, the corporal’s body was taken to the Anuradhaprua hospital, family members said.
