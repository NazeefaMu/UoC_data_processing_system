Can still qualify with a loss, on a better net run rate than Zim
Sri Lanka face dominant  Bangladesh

DHAKA: It’s make or break for Sri Lanka as they face host Bangladesh in the final group match of the one-day tri-nation here on Thursday. 
Sri Lanka have managed to overcome their run of defeats at the start of the series and the loss of their captain Angelo Mathews to keep themselves in the contention for the final. 
They were also handed a lifeline by Bangladesh, who beat Zimbabwe in the last game, to keep the series open.
Now up against hosts, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka will hope to complete their turnaround and seal a spot in the final. 
They will once again look to Thisara Perera to provide them an all-round impact as he has been doing throughout the tri-series.
Sri Lanka can still qualify with a loss, given that they have a better net run rate than bottom-placed Zimbabwe. They will, however, hope to not leave it to that chance.
Sri Lankan captain Dinesh Chandimal said that the initial losses in the tri-nation tournament spurred the team on to complete a turnaround and make the final.
Sri Lanka lost their opening two games respectively against Bangladesh and Zimbabwe and were needed to win both their remaining games as well as have other results go their way if they were to make it to the next stage.
The managed to beat Zimbabwe in their third game, while Bangladesh handed them a further lifeline by beating the African country again. Now, Sri Lanka are left with their fate in their own hands. A win would see them through to the final against the hosts, Bangladesh.
“In this kind of tournament, if you lose the first two games, it’s always tough. But sometimes, it gives you more confidence and morale to come back strong,” Chandimal told reporters at Dhaka.
“As a team, we’re looking at it that way. We will have something up our sleeves as a team, and we’re hoping to get a good result tomorrow,” he added. 
“We need to play it like any other game. We need to focus on what we can control. That’s what we’re going to do as a team.”
Chandimal added that they know their opponent will be tough to beat as their performance on home soil gives them an edge.
“We all know that Bangladesh - when they are playing on home soil - are really good as a team. They’ve played some outstanding cricket through this series, so the credit goes to the Bangladesh team,’ said Chandimal.
“We can all make mistakes. Cricket is like that. They’re on their home soil but as a team we need to play to our strengths. That’s what we want to do.”
Chandimal said that injuries remained a major concern for them in the recent past as it hampered their balance. They have already lost Angelo Mathews and Kusal Perera due to injuries.
“In the last one and a half years, injuries have been a major concern for us. Once the players get injured, you can’t get the right combination. We have concerns, but the boys will come back strong.”
Chandimal added that the management isn’t very sure of what kind of wicket they will be playing on on Thursday.
“They are preparing 2-3 wickets. We couldn’t tell which wicket they are going to give tomorrow. We’re still looking to see what they are going to give tomorrow. ‘I’m not sure why it’s that complicated. We’re ready to play on any wicket,” he summed up.
Bangladesh, on the other hand, have been on a rampant run. Three wins in as many games, and all with a bonus point, shows just how dominating the hosts have been in the tri-series. 
Unlike in the past, they haven’t relied on one or two players to put up a show, instead getting performances from multiple angles to put in clinical efforts in their three wins. They would want to wrap up the group stage with another thumping win.
