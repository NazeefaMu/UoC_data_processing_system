Another batting  collapse hands  Pakistan series 3-0

Wednesday: Sri Lanka suffered an all too familiar middle order batting collapse losing six wickets for 61 and their last nine wickets for 106 runs to hand to Pakistan a seven wickets win in the third ODI and with it a winning 3-0 lead in the five-match series at the Sheikh Zayed Stadium here on Wednesday.
It was Sri Lanka’s seventh ODI series loss since beating Ireland 2-0 in 2016.
Batting first for the first time in the series Sri Lanka failed to capitalise on a fine start from 102-1 to collapse to 208 all out in 48.2 overs.
Pakistan fast bowler Hasan Ali who destroyed the Sri Lanka batting with career best figures of 5 for 34 celebrates with his trademark signal as he claims the wicket of Niroshan Dickwella in the third ODI played at Sheikh Zayed Stadium in Abu Dhabi on Wednesday.
Pakistan buoyed by an opening stand of 78 by Fakhar Zaman (29) and debutant Imam-ul-Haq, the nephew of Pakistan legend and present chairman of selectors Inzamam-ul-Haq who went onto score an excellent century cruised home with 7.3 overs to spare.
Bespectacled Imam 21, playing with the flair of his famous uncle struck five fours and two sixes in a risk-free knock of 100 off 125 balls to become only the second Pakistani in two decades after Saleem Elahi to score a century on ODI debut and the 13th overall. Strangely Elahi also scored his debut hundred against Sri Lanka at Gujranwala in 1995.
For a few seconds Imam had his heart in his mouth when at 89 he was given out caught behind off Dushmantha Chameera and he as he walking back to the pavilion despondently the umpires stopped him to check the validity of the catch. To Imam’s relief he was recalled to resume his innings as television replays showed the ball falling short of Dickwella before he grasps it with his gloves.
Apart from their batting disappointments the Lankan bowlers showed they lacked the penetration to exploit the conditions and put pressure on the Pakistani batsmen. As it was Pakistan simply cruised towards their target with not so much pressure on the run rate which was a mere four runs an over at the start of their run chase.

Skipper Upul Tharanga who made a century in the second ODI was once again the top scorer for his side with 61 off 80 balls (5 fours) and the next highest scorer was Thisara Perera with 38 off 37 balls (5 fours).
It was a rather spineless display of batting by the Lankans as they failed to use their feet against the spinners and moreover to rotate the strike constantly that led to their downfall once again.
The way things stand Sri Lanka will continue to go through similar collapses until their middle order can be stabilised.
They badly need to get Kusal Perera, Angelo Mathews and Asela Gunaratne (all recovering from injuries) up and running as early as possible to lend some solidity to the middle order
Sri Lanka dropped the out of form Kusal Mendis and brought in experienced Chamara Kapugedera but he could not contribute much dollying a return catch to Hasan Ali who ran through the Lankan batting to finish with career best figures of 5 for 34 and in the process became the quickest Pakistani to reach 50 ODI wickets playing in his 25th match.
Sri Lanka didn’t have luck running their way either when Lahiru Thirimanne one of the top order batters was dismissed caught off his boot by wicket-keeper Sarfraz Ahmed who ended up with four catches.
The fourth and fifth ODIs will take place in Sharjah on October 20 and 23..
Niroshan Dickwella is bowled by Hasan Ali for 18
