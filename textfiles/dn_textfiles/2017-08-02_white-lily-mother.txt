A White Lily for Mother

Short story:
Seated on the concrete bench overlooking the cemetery was a little boy probably ten years old in school uniform. He looked at the people passing by him pleadingly but none had the presence of mind to even stop and enquire why the child was all alone at this late hour. They were busy scurrying to respective graveyards carrying varieties of flowers in sheaves and bouquets. Today was Mother’s day. There were glistening tears on the boy’s eyelids. How can I ask someone for a flower, no one seems to have the time to speak to me thought he.
In a dejected mood when he thought he should go into the cemetery without any flowers, he spotted a young man carrying a sheaf of fresh white lilies swiftly pass his way. Even though he was walking quickly, yet he had the time to glance at him who looked at the man sorrowfully. His pathetic look made the man look at him for awhile, ‘Yes my child what are you doing here all alone at this time of the day’ asked he. ‘Please Sir, could you give me a flower’ said he. ‘Sure, take this one’, handing over the largest and fresh white lily from his sheaf to him. Thanking him profusely for his generosity, he saw the little boy run into the cemetery. With deep curiosity, the man waited until the child had gone a little further and then followed him to the spot. He saw him kneel down beside a grave just freshly laid and place the flower at the head of the grave. With clasped hands the boy was sobbing, tears pouring down his face. Moved by the pathetic sight the young man noticed that uncontrollable tears were streaming down his face too. It was unusual since he had last cried three years ago when he lost his mother. But today after a long time, yes, he was crying for the little boy. The child was unaware that he was being watched since he was in a world of his own sobbing loudly.
The man’s presence at the cemetery was to place white lilies which he did every year for his mother who had passed away a few years back. White lilies was his mother’s favourite flower. She had grown them in abundance in their backyard and the drawing-room and kitchen tables always had a vase of these flowers which brought in a exquisite aroma once they were replaced with fresh ones every week. He would watch his mother arrange them in tall glass vases. Mother was unaware that he too loved this particular flower. So, every year on Mother’s day, he made it a habit to take a sheaf of white lilies from his garden to place them at her grave. The sight of the little boy crying continuously was really agonizing, that he walked towards him to hand over the sheaf in his hand. Looking at him with teary eyes, the boy was reluctant to take them, but when the man persisted, with tears brimming he clasped the flowers and said, ‘Thank you Sir’ , and then placed them on the right hand side of the grave.
Gently breaking the silence, the man enquired as to who was buried there. ‘It’s my Mother, she died last week, and fresh tears poured down his face once again. I cry a lot at night, I want my Mum back, no one seems to help me. I have seen Dad cry too but he swiftly wipes his tears when he sees me. He tells me that Mum has gone to God and that she is watching me. Also he tells me not to cry always as she will feel very sad, to eat well and study hard and that she would like that. “I want to go to my Mum, please help me’ said the child. ‘No, you can’t do that’ said the man’ patting the boy’s head.
You know Sir, last Monday, she kissed me good-bye as usual before I left for school and asked me not to forget to eat the lunch, and not get late, to be home early. You know I got good marks for the drawing which Mum helped me and it was shown to the whole class. So, I brought it, unfolding the painting to show the man. ‘Isn’t it an evening by the sea, it’s really picturesque’ said the man. ‘When I came home she was not in and I waited that whole night for her arrival, she never came. Why should this happen to my Mum. Father does not know I am here, I quickly came here after school to tell her of the achievement ’ the boy said.
Random thoughts crossed the young man’s mind. His mother had passed away of old age but this child’s mother was gone in his prime of life. This was most disheartening, he was crying away his heart, poor child. Moved by the little boy’s speech, he said, ‘Come my child don’t loiter you will get lost, I shall take you home, I wish to meet your father too. The child nodded.
