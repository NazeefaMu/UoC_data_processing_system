High-roller fame in the ‘attabola’ game!

In recent years young consumers have been inundated by a barrage of high- tech toys, computers, designer dolls, war games and robotics. Unfortunately, they never experienced the excitement of playing the centuries’ old ball game which is considered the first lesson in entrepreneurship combined with skill. Yes siree, it was all about winning, losing, socialising, developing hand-eye coordination and reasoning skills in determining the best shots.
Yes marbles belong to a bygone era of innocence, gentility and safety. Boys and girls nowadays have little interest in such a pastime. Ahhh, marbles or ‘attabola’ as they are called in local jargon, how we loved them. Besides, it was a time when we were well armed in the battle against childhood boredom
We were mesmerised by them when we were little ‘uns. There was something very comforting about rolling those cool, smooth, colourful glass orbs between your fingers. Even the tiniest lisping marbles buffs described it all too aptly when they simply stated: “Marbellous.”
Some of the faint-hearted among us had huge collections but would never play. That is because they were so attached to them that they would never risk losing one of their precious gee-gaws. The marble arena could be made ready in a matter of seconds. All the players had to do was to draw a square on a flat surface of earth and clear it of all impediments.
When the ground was smooth and ready the players would mark the shooting line about five feet away. Then a marble would be placed dead centre of the square and someone would stomp heavily on it and pivot on one’s heel to make a hole. A lexicon of slang words for the new varieties of the shiny round spheres took hold of the tongues of the youth in what still remains a confusing language for the uninitiated.
In Sri Lanka the hole at the centre was known by every man-Jack of a marbles’ enthusiast as simply the ‘Jill.’ The shooter would throw a clutch of shiny glass balls into the square. If he was skilled enough to land them all inside the square and if one popped into the ‘Jill’ he was given a second chance to shoot. If any of them rolled out of the square an opponent placed it on the line and gave it a finger flick to whichever part of the arena he preferred. Very much like a throw-in during a soccer game when the ball is kicked out of play.
Depending on the position of your target ball you had to roll, toss, flick or give your shooter a backspin or ‘screwball’ to make a clean hit. The last mentioned was termed an ‘Iskuruppu’ by the local lads. The trick was to hit a single target. Because if the ball you hit caromed into another marble you forfeited your turn to shouts of “Dhadey’ from your opposing mates.
In the local parlance of ‘marbleology’ a clean hit was called an ‘Adi’. And for some obscure reason an ace player was termed a ‘Carper.’ Their reputations always preceded them. And much like professional billiard players no one seemed game enough to include them in a game.
Playing for ‘keepsies’ was called ‘take-for-take’ in the Lankan marbles lingo. In grades 3 to 6 the greatest lessons we learned for the future would be derived from the attabola games. For us it was investment time, risk taking time and time for character discovery. And the currency was marbles.
Marbles of all kinds were traded, won or lost in a short period. And what an array of glittering orbs was on display. Cats’ eyes marbles, swirl marbles, solid blues, reds, whites, yellows, oranges, blacks, purples, and greens. They were mostly made from glass but there were the rarer and precious ones made from agate, onyx, marble and porcelain.
Looking back, I realise that marble shooting had a value that transcended the lofty status those smooth shiny globes of glass conferred upon their possessors. There are other games that require longer hours of practice to master, and many are far more competitive. But I am going to stick my neck out and claim that only marbles develop so many admirable and desirable traits in a youth.
With pockets bulging, we would hit the school quadrangle realising we only had 15 minutes to increase or decrease our stockpiles. We were mostly high-rollers in the attabola game. Entire fortunes were won or lost in such little time.
I was never all that good at the game. But now and again I would have one heck of a lucky streak. I remember one particular morning during the ‘tea recess’ I was experiencing a phenomenal run of fortune. It appeared that I simply could not miss even while firing without real concentration.
I won so many marbles I thought of actually retiring as the champion ‘carper’ of all time. But then I lost them all in the ‘lunch interval’. It appears really horrifying when I look back and imagine my being a degenerate gambler at age 10 or 11.
Today, these fairy bubbles, made ostensibly for children, seem to be bewitching balls when viewed by adults. Collecting old marbles is a pastime equally interesting to children or adults. High rolling games definitely had their therapeutic aspect. It was said about our playmate Isaac that when he handled marbles, he salivated.
For a moment there, differences evaporated. Cultures melded in the universality of a shared smile or a devilish dare. The kids didn’t care about the big picture or this age’s fetish with instant analysis. Why was it popular? Who knew or who cared? And, rules, what rules? There was bragging to be done, trades to be made, shouts of glee, marbles on the loose and holes to fill. Call it the joy of being passionate high-rollers!
Among the most treasured of any player’s collection was a ‘taw’ which was essentially the ‘shooter’ marble. The prized shooter was usually heavier and fractionally larger than the normal target marbles. Then there were ‘steelie’ shooters which were considered cool and valued possessions. They are essentially marble-sized steel ball-bearings which were much sought after by aficionados.
In the local lexicon this ‘boss’ marble was called all kinds of names which carried shades of suggestiveness. Just imagine! They were conferred such appellations as the ‘Tomba Taw’ or the ‘Gunda.’
An extremely fair-complexioned schoolmate carried his milky white agate taw wherever he went. It was dubbed the ‘Kiri Tomba’ by his playmates particularly when he got down on his haunches like the rest. Everyone said his ‘Kiri Tomba’ suited his personality and everything else about him to a T or rather a ‘Taw.’
