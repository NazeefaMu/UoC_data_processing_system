Life in a condominium

A large number of eminent resource persons made their presentations with regard to various aspects of condominium living and the manner of usage of common elements and common amenities.
The awareness programme was mainly dedicated to State officers involved in assisting the Condominium Management Authority and the management corporations in charge of condominium maintenance.
Local Government agency, Land Ministry, Police Department, Divisional Secretariats, and Provincial Councils officers participated.
At the end of the session, Condominium Management Authority Chairman C. A. Wijeyeweere was interviewed.
He said that this Awareness programme organized by the Condominium Management Authority, was to make the relevant stakeholders aware of the condominium style of living, without causing any hindrance to neighbouring apartment owners.
When Wijeyeweere was requested to make the general public aware as to what a condominium property is, he said that a condominium parcel/unit is a defined space; they are independent parcels in a condominium plan, designed for independent use.
In response to an inquiry as to what types of condominiums are available in Sri Lanka, he added there are three categories of condominiums, namely Residential, Commercial, and Mixed-Development.
Explaining on the common elements of condominium property, Wijeyeweere said structural components cannot be directly attributed to any single dwelling unit.
Foundation, columns, main load-bearing walls; components meant for common use, such as staircases, corridors, lifts, fire escapes, garages, community halls, playgrounds, access roads, motors, and pumps, are considered as common elements and amenities in a condominium.
These common elements need to be identified in a condominium plan. When an individual gets the ownership of a condominium parcel, they also get the right to utilize its common elements, and these are legally conferred to them.
The Chairman added that he was impressed with the interest displayed by the panel of resource persons and the participants who actively participated in the deliberations.
