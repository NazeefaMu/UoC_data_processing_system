Colombo City Centre to open in December

The first stage of the Colombo City Centre (CCC), in Colombo 2, is scheduled to be opened in December and it would become Sri Lanka’s first hypermall.
A joint venture between Abans Group and Silver Needle Hospitality, CCC would also offer Sri Lanka’s first and largest six-screen multiplex cinema bringing retail and entertainment of world standards.
Rusi Pestonjee, Abans Group Director, said that the second stage of the project would include a 190-room Silver Needle branded 160-room business hotel and 190 apartments.
A US$ 170 million project, both the apartments and the hotel would be ready by October 2018. He said that over 70% of the apartments have already been sold, stamping investor confidence for the project.
He said that the business hotel would be mainly targetting the high-end business travellers and for the first time it would offer mobile phone-enabled check in (smart booking) and check outs.
“Travellers would book online, select their room and pay online via credit card upon check out without ever going to the reception.”
Commenting on the retail space which will open up in December, he said that some of the world’s top brands would be showcased in it.
“Over 60% of the five-floor retail lifestyle mall has been sold out and some of the brands are being showcased for the first time in Sri Lanka.”
“We are also happy to partner with Scope Cinema to introduce a world-class cinematic experience that has never been seen before in Sri Lanka. Combining both state-of-the-art technology and facilities, this six-screen multiplex will provide truly the best movie offerings in Sri Lanka.”
“With the inclusion of this stunning multiplex cinema, the CCC Mall and its range of high-end retail brands will bring to Sri Lankans cutting-edge cinema entertainment,” he added.
Naveed Cader, Chairman, Scope Cinema (Pvt) Ltd, said they will have six multiplex screens, 650 seats and will be screening about 30 shows every day. “The idea is to have a show starting every 30 minutes as that is what the citizens of Colombo want – to watch a movie when they feel like it.”
Scope Cinema will also be introducing the latest in cutting-edge technology like Dolby Atmos Surround Sound and 4K projection for the first time in Sri Lanka. (SS)
