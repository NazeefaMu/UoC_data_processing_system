Cabinet to discuss proposal on  Gamperaliya project allowance

Cabinet Spokesman and Health Minister Dr.Rajitha Senaratne said the Cabinet proposal presented by the Prime Minister on additional allowance for MPs for the Gamperaliya project was not rejected and added that it will be taken for discussion next week.
Responding to a question raised by a journalist at the Cabinet Press Conference yesterday, the Minister assured that there was no issues between the President and the Prime Minister on that matter.
“The President did not reject the proposal made by the Prime Minister. We are yet to discuss and take a final decision,” he said.
Lands and Parliamentary Reforms Minister Gayantha Karunathilake said in order to make the Gamperaliya project a success, there was a suggestion to appoint MPs to observe the progress of the project and give them special benefits.
“It is not possible for the officials at the Ministry to take full responsibility for it.The Gamperaliya project which focuses on village development is a huge task. Therefore, there was a proposal to appoint MPs as observers to make it more efficient instead of appointing officers separately,” he explained.
He further said that Finance Ministry Secretary, Secretary to the Prime Minister and Secretary of the Parliamentary Affairs Minister were also aware of the proposal.
When asked about the proposal to increase the salaries of MPs, Minister Senaratne said the matter was discussed at the Party Leaders Meeting in Parliament, but no final decision was taken.
