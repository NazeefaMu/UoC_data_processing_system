PET scan installed at Maharagama hospital

The march against cancer organised by the Fight Cancer Trust was held on April 1 with the participation of 3,500 volunteers. The PET scan machine was vested with the public at the Maharagama cancer hospital by Health Minister Dr.Rajitha Senaratne.
The PET scan machine had been donated to the Maharagama Cancer hospital at a cost of Rs.250 million where the donations were made by the citizens of the country over three months. This is also the first time that a march against cancer was held in Sri Lanka. The funds collected during the march would be used to buy more equipment for the PET scan machine. The tri forces along with the Police and the STF also took part in this event.
“The march was a success and everything went smoothly.We are planning to perform free bypasses for the poor as our next project titled ‘Heart to Heart’ with Dr.Ruwan Ekanayake and Dr. Rajitha De Silva, experts in the field. Usually patients have to wait for about a year on the waiting list in Government hospitals and we plan to accelerate the process. We also urge the public to help in our upcoming projects,” an organiser said.
