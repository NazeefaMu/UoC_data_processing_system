Arpico to add 100,000 sq ft of green retail space

Richard Pieris Distributors Ltd’s mission is to add 100,000 sq ft of retail space to the modern trade market, asserted K A S Lasantha, General Manager, Richard Pieris Distributors.
These are upgraded, high level, retail operation models tested and proven in Europe. Fifteen years ago, Sri Lankan modern trade customers were served in 2,000-3,000 sq ft outlets under the supermarket label. Arpico came up with a new concept called Arpico Supercentres with 20,000-30,000 sq ft size.
“Our intention was to upgrade the Sri Lankan modern trade customer’s living standards to the next level of the day and 15 years ago we had given the right leadership to the retail business in Sri Lanka,” said Lasantha. “From that point onwards we have continuously kept on adding as a trend setting company that wishes to lift the bar of the industry.”
He said that when everybody was working towards turnover and profitability, they as a responsible company, by thinking of global sustainability, had taken a lot of green initiatives.
“For example, whatever buildings we are putting up are green buildings, coming with a green certification. All our roofs are filled with solar panels; 35-40 % of our energy is being generated on our own through our solar systems.”
Similarly, he said, whatever equipment they use is energy saving equipment and they make sure there is no waste. When considering lighting arrangements, they only use LED bulbs. All used water goes under a purification process before being discharged into the environment.
“By all these initiatives, we give the right leadership to the industry as a trend setting company. Right now we have 25 large format outlets and our requirement is to give the right retail space to the customers,” Lasantha said.
The General Manager said they intend to open five more large format outlets in 2018 with 100,000 sq ft of total retail space in Katugastota, Kegalle, Kundasale, Wattala and Moratuwa.
