A Smart Classrooms project initiated and funded by the Trinity College OBA – Colombo Branch was launched recently at the Junior School Hall, thus making a revolution in classroom teaching in Kandy. Each board installed in classrooms were ceremonially inaugurated by distinguished old boys, who then invited young students to try and test the all new Smart Board.
“The EWIS Smart Classroom technology, provides our students with instantaneous access to unlimited information and resources. It therefore completely transforms the schools’ educative process, enabling and encouraging them to access, analyze, interpret and apply knowledge to real world situations,” said Andrew Fowler – Watt, Principal, Trinity College Kandy at the inaugural ceremony.
This all new Smart Interactive Display, which is the foundation of Smart classrooms, was installed and facilitated by E-W Information Systems Ltd, a pioneer within Sri Lanka’s ICT industry. This Smart Interactive Display is said to be able to co-exist with the traditional whiteboard or blackboard, transforming the way teachers educate students in a classroom in addition to providing a better and more interactive, learning experience for the students.
“A Smart Interactive Display can be used by teachers and lecturers to adapt a more holistic teaching methodology – moving away from the traditional rote method of teaching,” said Nirmal Pieris, Chief Operating Officer, E-W Information Systems.

It is a change that we have to embrace as, it is no more a differentiator but a necessity,” said Suchitra Aluwihare, President, Trinity College OBA – Colombo Branch.
