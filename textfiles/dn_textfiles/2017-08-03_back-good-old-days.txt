Back to  good  old days

These are the only two schools in Sri Lanka which are together divided by a thin wall, but one playground, motto and tie (gold, purple and maroon). They study together as children of twin mothers.
The past Pupils of the Prince and Princess of Wales College, Moratuwa held its Back To School programme recently at the grounds. They entered their own childhood classes under their old teachers.
This was organized by the members of the two Past Pupils Associations of the two schools under the purview of the two Principals Malini Samarakoon and Kusala Fernando.
The Chief Guests were their own past pupils: Ushan Wijewardhana representing the boys and his wife Sudeshi representing the girls.
It was a memorable and a jubilant event with much glamour added by school bands. Though they were in their 40s – 60s, these elderly students have not forgotten the notes as yet.
