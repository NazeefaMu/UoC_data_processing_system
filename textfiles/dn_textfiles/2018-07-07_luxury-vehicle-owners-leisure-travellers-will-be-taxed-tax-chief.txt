Luxury vehicle owners, leisure travellers will be taxed - Tax Chief

The Inland Revenue Department identifies every individual who maintains a luxury vehicle and persons who travel abroad on holiday as taxable parties.We are of the view of that a tax should be imposed on such individuals, Inland Revenue Commissioner General Ivan Dissanayake said.
He made the above statement to the media following a workshop held at Dalawella in Galle on Wednesday.
"An individual who upkeeps a super luxury vehicle spends about Rs.500,000 with an average monthly expenditure of around 50,000 on such vehicle. Many Sri Lankans who tour overseas on every vacation are also considered as persons with a tax payable revenue. In Sri Lanka there are 1.6 million tax payers and we hope to raise the number by another 1 million by 2020," he said.
The Inland Revenue Department is at present actively connected with 32 state institutions to collect information on public servants also. "Based on revenue details obtained from organizations, we will have to advice them to open tax files and sometimes such officials will be asked to reveal their income avenues.So we request all who are in receipt of a taxable revenue to open a tax file on their own volition and fulfill their national obligation, Dissanayake said.
The main sources of state income are the Inland Revenue Department, the Customs Department and the Excise Department.
"The government spends Rs. 47,000 on a school child during his schooling period.When you multiply that amount by the total number of students in the country, you will understand the massive expenditure we have to bear on education.The State also spends Rs. 550,000 to train a doctor per year. To produce an engineer the government spends nearly Rs. 400,000 per year. It is the duty and obligation of all those who benefitted from public funds to contribute their share to the country in return for what the country gave for them," he said.
We are planning to increase the direct taxes up to 40% and indirect taxes up to 60% by 2020. The government had to suffer a loss of Rs.1200 million due to the elimination of VAT in respect channelling services of hospitals.
We have a population of 22 million out of which only 175,000 individuals have been registered for tax payments and only 75,000 persons pay taxes.Although there are 80,000 companies registered with the government only 45,000 firms pay the respective taxes.We are determined to increase the number up to 2.2 million by 2020.
