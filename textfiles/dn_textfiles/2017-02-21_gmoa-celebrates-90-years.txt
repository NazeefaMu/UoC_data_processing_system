GMOA celebrates 90 years

The Government Medical Officers' Association (GMOA) celebrated its 90th Anniversary on February 18 with a pirith chanting ceremony at the GMOA Headquarters in Colombo 7 with the presence of President Maithripala Sirisena.
The GMOA was inaugurated on October 16, 1926 in Kandy, attended by 16 medical officers. Initially, the Association was known as the Government Medical Officers’ Association (Central Province) and confined its activities to the province, although government medical officers of other provinces were also eligible for membership.
The association aims to safeguard the rights and privileges of its members. The first GMOA President was Dr. H. Ludovici and the Joint Secretaries were Dr. S. L. Navaratnam and Dr. I. A. Senanayake. The initial membership fee was Rs. 5 per year. Among the demands listed in the inaugural meeting are with regard to salaries, quarters and traveling allowances - the same issues that concern the membership even 75 years later.
In September 1927, the Association changed its scope renaming itself as the Government Medical Officers’ Association of Ceylon. Today, the GMOA is a potent force with a membership exceeding 16,000. The 90 branch unions function effectively at local level, coordinating with the centre.
