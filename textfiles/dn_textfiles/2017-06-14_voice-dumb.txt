Voice of  the dumb

The new collection of poems by Prof Kamani Jayasekera titled Voicing the DUMB is astonishingly rich with implicit analogies from Western Classical Culture. Therefore it enriches Lankan contemporary poetry. In other words, her poems display unusual nuances in understanding poetry. Published by Godage & Brothers (Pvt) Ltd, the book has a dashing blue and white colour showing a woman’s face. There are 50 crisp poems that are seemingly underscoring human values that are constantly changing in the contemporary digital world.
The first poem in the third stanza itself demonstrates the poet’s purpose in her writing. Here is the poem itself:
Just as a child at play
Crushes and crumbles
What he has built in clay
Or watches in glee
How his sand castles
Are swept away by the tide or
Vanish in the dancing foam
Nature watches idly
The waves
The floods
The Quakes
The landslides
Awe inspiring, magnificent Ruthless and terrible in themselves.
Officiating as a levelling force
Reminding man of his vulnerability
And impotence. Robbing him
Of stability, dignity and tranquillity.
I like the line “Savour the beauty of luxury” in the poem titled ‘Satisfaction’. The irony in the poem ‘Justice” such as “Making Sri Lankans do the same …seeking solace from him (Hanuman) for their benefit and protection” is very striking. I also like the philosophical lines - “And attachment evokes nothing but pain. The statue was only a symbol and in it vested no value.” In the poem called “Lessons”. The humour in ‘Sibling attractions’ is enjoyable.
The poet’s keen observation of the everyday life of mundane things (as most of us may dismiss,) in most of her poems, are brought to our attention in a humorous way. And those are revelations.
The poem titled “Ethical Lessons” is again sprung from the poet’s classical learning of being humane in complicated issues. The surprise ending in the poem titled “A Different Language” is very touching incident in the conjugal relationship.
Again, ”Dignity of Genetics” is rhythmic and the concise descriptive expression is pleasing:
“Asian girl, with dark hair flowing
Doe like eyes sparkling in the dusky
Face of divine expression,
Sings in the subway, the guitar in hand”
I enjoyed the way how the poet handled a parallel from classical literature to current happenings in the poem titled “Impact” which concludes this way:
“Unable to evoke emotions, let alone the tragic
FOR
This is the twenty-first century
Of the Common Era
After and not before.”
In some other poems, the irony stands out.
I like this last stanza in the poem called Hallucination:
“Forgetting the past,
Not knowing the future,
Under the mirage of certainty.”
In ‘Word Power’, the poet gives a quotation in a dialogue: ‘Words could kill / If not immediately / after they seep into conscience / Absorbed, soaked and digested / to corrode and infest the system’ / She complained in utter misery”
In another poem, the poet surprises us with this at the end as ‘this lady who rides the garbage truck”. Please read the poem No. 26 for a nice description.
Please read rest of Kamani Jayasekea’s poems for they are evidently self – explanatory with a pungent social comment. I enjoyed reading with pleasure this collection of poetry.
