Thisara Perera hit on head but in no danger

Sri Lanka all-rounder Thisara Perera was hit by a ball on the head during practice at Cardiff on Saturday ahead of the all important Champions Trophy game against Pakistan on Monday.
In a most fortunate turn of events, there has been no serious injury and although under careful observation there is currently no complaint related to head injury, with only reports of tenderness in the area of impact.
