Royal win easily

Royal enjoyed one of their finest hours in recent Bradby Shield games when they thrilled a crowd of over 7,000 by toppling Trinity with a sparkling 19-0 victory in a “first 'leg' match, played at Longden Place, yesterday.
Trinity were out paced, out manoeuvred and outclassed by this 'new look' Royal team. This was apparent from the way Royal set off from the kick-off.
The Royal three-quarters were always threatening in attack and with better handling and passing they had to score. The Trinitians, on the contrary, were a nervous lot. They dropped their passes and were rushed to errors so often that it made things easier for Royal to drive a thick wedge in the “loose” through quick heels and mount their attacks.
Of the four tries that Royal scored, the best came late in the game when 15-year-old Jagath Fernando intercepted a pass near the halfway mark and ran straight to score mid right. C.T. de Silva converted.
Royal had a better supply of the ball through the good work of hooker Punithakumar in the set pieces and L.A.I. de Silva in the lines out. And every time the hall came their way Samarawickrema slung his passes swiftly to Malwatte for the entire line to engage some hard running.
The Royal forwards outwitted Ajith Abeyratne, Omar Furlounge and Shanti Kumar. All this was the good work of C.R. de Silva, who was ably supported by Rex Pereira, Yousoof, LAL de Silva, Punithakumar and Kannangara.
Powerful line kicking by Jagath Fernando kept Trinity pegged in their 25 during the first ten minutes of play. Maintaining pressure near the goalline Royal scored in the 12th minute.
A quick heel from a set piece10 yards from the goalline saw the ball go down to winger HSD Soysa who fell over for an unconverted try.
They came hack again in quest of more and hustled full back Nugawela to err behind his goalline and lob a pass for Yousoof to pounce on it and score a try. C.T. de Silva goaled this.
Three minutes before the half Jagath Fernando began a dribble in mid field and Nugawela once again collapsed under the onslaught for winger Soysa to grab the ball and score a try. C.T. de Silva goaled it for Royal to lead 18-0 at the half.
After the restart came Jagath Fernando’s try and later a penalty goal put over by Tilak de Silva made the final tally 19-0.
