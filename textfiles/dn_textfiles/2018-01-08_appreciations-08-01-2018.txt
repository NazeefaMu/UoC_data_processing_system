[APPRECIATIONS - (08-01-2018)]

Ranjan Anandappa
The legend lives on
Ranjan Anandappa, 68, sports journalist, cricketer, cricket umpire, match referee, bilingual vocalist, and song writer, remains in death the way he lived; revered by all who knew him. If one of Ranjan's attributes stood out most, it must have been his humility. Ranjan's perpetual smile alone radiated his unassuming nature. Wise men have said that what the world lacks most today, is humility.
When in 2002, Ranjan's illustrious sub-editor father, Clarence, passed away, Ranjan requested that I writer an appreciation of my former colleague. Now, perhaps the junior Anandappa stands in line. Ranjan was in many ways like his father; dignified, soft spoken, and cautious in his comments.
When in 1994, I met Ranjan at the Sunday Observer, it was as if I found a long-lost, non-related brother. For, at my alma-mater, I had been the classmate of his wife Christine's brother, Brian, and there was the younger, Camillus. As a schoolboy, I had been a frequent visitor to their home; the same house Rajan lived in after marriage and up to a year ago, when he moved out of Kotahena. Besides, many of his and his wife's brothers and cousins were my classmates who studied at St. Benedict's, Colombo 13, during the 195'0s and 60's. At the same school, the succeeding generations of Anandappas and Pullayagams were my son's classmates or schoolmates.
A few days before Ranjan's passing, I told him on the phone that having come back to live in Kelaniya, I wished he could take me to meet his former classmate Field Marshall Sarath Fonseka. He said that he had never kept in touch with a politician, but for my sake, he would oblige. That confirms what the late journalist Ajith Samranayake said; that Ranjan had no politics in him.
Days later, when I called back, Ranjan's son Roshan answered; Ranjan had been laid to rest, I was told. On line, Roshan wished to speak to my wife, who had been his school librarian. Then, Ranjan's personal mobile went dead.
Ranjan, with his busy lifestyle, kept very fit; ironically, his first heart attack, claimed him. When he lived in my nearby neighbourhood, often on Sunday nights, we would go about on my bicycle for a beer.
Rajan atended De Mazanod College, Kandana, where he lived. To justify his cricketting talent, he got himself into Ananda College, Colombo. He sat next to Sarath Fonseka, who was a swimmer, he said. They studied in the Sinhala medium, making him bilingual.
Ranjan was an opening left arm swing bowler, idolising Alan Davidson and Garfield Sobers. He played Daily News Trophy cricket and could have graduated to Sara Trophy cricket, if in those days the opportunities for playing and working were conducive.
It was also unfortunate that Ranjan was for most of his school career, in a non-cricket-playing school and had the chance of playing just for two yeas at Ananda College.
Once, playing for a combined press team in India, Ranjan was referred to as Davidson,and he told me that it was the greatest honour he had received during his cricketing career.
At dinner, Ranjan would share the newspaper cutting on his cricketing career. He would talk of the way cricket had changed over 50 years. Ranjan liked to spend part of his Sundays visiting cricketers who were older than himself. On meeting Dr. Colman Perumal for the first time, the former left armers of different sorts went sentimental.
Ranjan kept the Sabbath, attending the 4 p.m. mass at the Kotchchikade church dedicated to Mary, the mother of Jesus, where he said many of his community, the Colombo Chettys, attended service. Often, on Sunday's, Ranjan also visited his mother.
Ranjan lived a happy family life. Colombo Chetty wives were the most faithful and loving wives in the world, he said. Covering cricket matches overseas, Ranjan never chose the Primrose path, other journalists said.
Ranjan would talk of a Barbados cricketing legend once charged for rape and released; and other things, little known.
He had covered cricket series in all or most cricketing countries. He spoke of Gary Sobers’ engagement to an Indian actress; then, his marriage to Prudence Kirby; and Sobers’ son and daughter, who he had met.
He said that Mustaq Mohammed having played cricket at 14 was possibly incorrect; that some Paksitanis of that era had their ages mixed up. Ranjan spoke of Muttiah Muralidharna; that the cloud over the spinner would pass away and the ICC would rule that Murali could bowl his doosra. Ranjan said a blast of wind could make a cricket ball move unpredictably through the air and that turf wickets had many surprises. He said that umpires were human and made mistakes, and after all cricket, being just a game, one's averages and wins and losses were not as important as playing the game.
Covering cricket matches late Saturday nights, Ranjan would invariably call and ask, “Machan, are you there?” At the editorial, Ranjan would read his script to the late night reporter who was a touch typist. With hands free, he could better meet deadlines, he would say.
Just as cultural anthropologists say: when and old accomplished Bushman hunter dies, a library of information on survival in the Kalahari Desert is lost. With Ranjan's passing, a storehouse of cricketting and other sports information in a practical way, is gone with the wind. The sower went out to sow, and rarely indeed is a harvest of over eighty fold gathered. May the turf over Ranjan Anandappa be greener.
A former colleague
M. A. Bakeer Markar
An honest politician
The late Mohamed Abdul Bakeer Markar was born on May 12, 1917. His ancestry is traced to Sheikh Jamaludeen Al-Maghdoomi, the pioneer Arab settler who settled down in the sea board town of Beruwala.
His father, Hakeem Aliar Marikkar Mohomed Marikkar, belonged to family of physicians, whose ancestors were also physicians.
He was born in Beruwala and was educated at Zahira College, Colombo. The late Dr. T. B. Jaya was the principal at that time. Markar was the Chief Editor of college magazine. He excelled in debating and was elected speaker of the school majilis. He passed his London matriculation examination and later, pursued higher studies.
At his own alma-mater he became a teacher during Dr. T. B. Jayah's stewardship and later entered the core management as Chairman of the Board of Governors. His loyalty to his alma-mater was displayed by him throughout. As an eminent old Zahirian of great lustre, he set an example for other students.
He entered Law College in 1940 and passed out as a lawyer in 1950. His legal career was interrupted during World War II, as he had to take up duties in Civil Defence Services in 1942. During that period, he was also sent for civil defence training in India.
As a lawyer, he had a lucrative practice. He was President of the Kalutara Branch of the Bar Association of Sri Lanka.
Hailing from a minority community which had recently quickened to political activity, the late Bakeer Marker made an indelible mark in the political history of Sri Lanka. Dr. T. B. Jayah, who was his ‘guru’ in education, turned out to be his political ‘guru’ as well. With late Jahan, he was in the forefront of the activities of All Ceylon Muslim League as its Vice President, when Dr. M. C. M. Kaleel was President (he was the Founder President of the All Ceylon Union of Muslim League). He was unanimously elected as the Beruwala Urban Council Chairman in 1950. Further, he was the Chairman of the Beruwala Maradana Mosque Jama-ath until his demise.
He hailed from Maradana, Beruwala, where as historically revealed, the early Arabs who arrived at Ceylon built the first ever mosque in Ceylon, Viz Masjid-Ul-Abrar.
He took great pains in renovating the Jama-ath mosque with the help of his village. In doing so, he was careful to retain the original architectural shape and beauty of the mosque.
He first entered Parliament in March, 1960 and was re-elected in 1965 and 1977. He was elected as Deputy Speaker in 1977 and was elected as Speaker in 1978. Him being elected as Speaker was the greatest milestone in his local political career; he became the only speaker of Parliament to date to have acted for the President of Sri Lanka, when both the then President J. R. Jayawardene and the then Prime Minister R. Premadasa were away from the country.
He also served as the last Speaker of the old Parliament at Galle Face, and as the first Speaker of the new Parliament in Sri Jayawardenepura, Kotte.
He excelled in international relations as well; his close connection with the Iraqi government enabled him to build the Saddm Hussain village and Karbala village for cyclone victims and was the Iraq-Sri Lanka Friendship Association Founder President, remaining in the position until his demise.
In the early 1980's, a plane carrying Indonesian Haj pilgrims on their return journey, crashed in Sri Lanka. The then Speaker Bakeer Markar rushed to the scene and took personal interest to have the bodies of the pilgrims dispatched to Indonesia. As a token of appreciation, the President of Indonesia personally invited him to visit his country.
The Indonesian Haj memorial building of Sri Lanka was initiated by him.
During the end of his Parliamentary career, he served as minister without portfolio in the Cabinet of President J. R. Jayewardene and was appointed governor of Southern Province in 1988.
In this manner, following the footsteps of his political ‘guru,’ T. B. Jayah, Bakeer Markar blossomed into one of Sri Lanka's senior politicians with honesty of purpose, and his sincerity in politics won him many friends.
During his Parliamentary career, he had a vision to serve the nation, which he fulfilled with determination and firm commitment until his demise on September 10, 1997.

Judge C.G. Weeramantry
A legal luminary
I first met Judge C. G. Weeramantry, or Judge (as we call him), in December, 2007; when by luck, I received the opportunity to intern at the Weeramantry International Centre for Peace Education and Research (WICPER). I had read and heard many stories about Judge Weeramantry and his contribution to the legal world, and was truly intimidated prior to meeting him. To my surprise, I was introduced to a humble and kind gentleman, who would always have a beautiful smile on his face. It was hard to imagine that this gentleman was the former Vice President of the International Court of Justice (ICJ).
Subsequently, I had the privilege to work for his organization for four years, and got to know this wonderful human being quite intimately. Judge’s greatest strength and driving force was his wife, Rosemary. A strong-willed lady with a jovial spirit, Madam ran the show, enabling Judge to focus on his legal writings. Judge was also blessed with five wonderful children, and 11 grandchildren, all of whom treated us like we were part of the family.
Judge was a wealth of knowledge on various topics such as history, religion, law, and the environment; he was gracious enough to impart this knowledge on professionals and students alike. His constant message to the world was that we should utilize our resources sparingly, protect the environment, and fulfill our duties and responsibilities towards future generations.
Judge was a rare human being; generous and nurturing in spirit, with a heart full of love for all of humanity.
He was an amazing mentor, teacher and friend to all of us. The gift of legal teachings he presented to the world and his work towards the abolishment of nuclear weapons, would inspire generations to come.
Dearest Judge, thank you for all that you did for each and every one of us. It is one of the greatest honours of my life to have known a gentleman such as you.Heaven is blessed and richer now, with your presence. May you be blessed, always!

Marhoom M. S. M. Harees and Marhooma Husna Harees
They were wise and loving
We never know the love of a parent till we become parents ourselves. - Henry Ward Beecher.
It was 25 years ago that our beloved mother, Noorul Husna, unexpectedly passed away peacefully in her sleep at our ancestral home in Galle, immersing our family into a state of shock and grief. Barely a year later, our beloved father, popularly known as Harees master, passed away as well, which made us inconsolable. The family, however, took consolation in the Quranic dicta: ‘Every soul shall taste death’ and ‘We are from Allah; to him will we return.’
We don't think there was anything that could have prepared us to lose both parents two years apart, let alone one parent. It was a larger blow in adulthood, when we were at a point where we were actually beginning to set up our own families and becoming closer to them, as mother or father. Their wisdom sank into us only later in life, and we knew that all admonitions, punishments, and sanctions imposed on us as teenagers really were done out of love and affection and for our greater good, which proved much useful during our own roles as parents.
Our mother, Noor Husna Datha (as she was affectionately called by her circle of friends) taught what humanity, empathy and generosity means, not just to the three of us; but to all those she came into contact with, way beyond our family circles. She was the second daughter of Thangam Datha (Golden Lady), who was a respected religious figurehead among Muslim ladies of Galle Fort and her uncle Lafir Alim was in the board of scholars which translated the Quran into Sinhala for the first time. She was a role model who taught us to live and let live with the divine purpose of life in mind.
Our father Harees Master was a distinguished poet, literary genius, linguist, and an accomplished academic well-known all over the island, with many publications in Tamil and English to his credit.
He was the grandson of an Islamic poet of Galle; Cader Samsuddeen. He served at the Alhambra in Aluthgama, the Teachers' Training College in Addalachenai, and Malharus Sulhiya National College, Galle; as well as at Jamiah Naleemia, Beruwela, with great distinction. Dr. Shukri, one of his distinguished students, wrote in the commemoration souvenir published on the occasion of his 10th death anniversary in 2003, ‘Harees was a multi-dimensional personality. He was an ideal devoted teacher; a teacher par excellence with vision, a poet with a fine aesthetic sense, and above all, a great human being.' We are eternally grateful to Allah for having blessed us with such great parents.
Their deaths have forever changed us and how we look at the world. In an odd way, it has made us better parents as well. We are always acutely aware of what such vivid and great memories of our childhood did and will do to enrich our lives and the lives of our children while we are on this earth. They deserve to know how much we still treasure them in our thoughts and memories, even after they have gone to join our Creator.
More importantly, the good values and morals they taught us and instilled in us will forever remain as their abiding legacy.
Although death is a mournful thing, the harrowing experience taught us very important lessons in life for which we thank the Almighty. May Allah make their resting place a garden of Jennah and join us with them in the hereafter.

Gupta Gunawardene
Computer genius
Of a very pleasant disposition, Gupta Gunawardene, whom we considered a computer genius, passed away on December 12, 2012. I came to know Gupta in 1981 at Radio Shack Computer Centre, to which I was transferred from Sky Travels in the Bartleet Group. The task Gupta Gunawardene and I were called upon to perform was to start a computer school for the company. I had experience in the administration of Catholic Private Schools prior to joining the Bartleet group. We clicked well and worked happily together.
Having worked with Gupta for nearly 10 years at the Bartleet Institute of Computer Studies (ICS), we came to know each other closely. Gupta was a successful computer programmer, formerly attached to AMS computer Systems. Until 1990, he conducted many computer programming courses in BASIC and Cobol languages, and more than 5,000 school leavers, both boys and girls, passed through his hands as computer programmers. Gupta used neither test books to teach nor did he consulted others for knowledge. He trained students mostly by practical exercises and computer time sufficiently assigned. His attention was equally divided among all students and he had neither favourites nor specially-considered students. Later, he conducted courses in Systems Analysis and Design combined with Systems Analysts engaged in other commercial establishments. As a lecture, Gupta Gunawardene won the favour of all students.
Successful students of the Bartleet Institute of Computer Studies found easy employment in Computer firms and commercial establishments, while the cream was absorbed into Bartleet Group itself and its clients.
Some students went abroad and secured employment in the computer field. Due to popular demand, a branch of the Institute of Computer Studies was opened in Kandy and, three of our best students from Kandy were assigned to conduct lectures while Gupta monitored them. After About 1990, Bartleet Electronics started dealing in mainframe computers and Gupta was absorbed in developing tailor-made programmes for its clients banks and so on.
Gupta has an elder sister who is a retired doctor, and his brother-in-law is also a medical officer serving in the Army Hospital. Gupta's father associated closely with former premier Dudley Senanayake, but Gupta's family was never politically inclined. In fact, Gupta was a close associate of present Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe; frequent school gatherings at St. Thomas’ and the Royal College gave both of them ample opportunity to meet and develop a friendship. Gupta was an avid reader of astrology, astronomy, psychology and the like. He was a jewel of a human being who caused no trouble to others.
Bartleet Electronics gained much from the ICS, and I feel happy that I was able to contribute my little share in serving the younger generation to achieve success in the computer field.
As he was a perfectionist, Gupta could not find an accurately-matching marriage partner of computer precision, and consequently, he remained a bachelor throughout. I was stressed when I heard of his death. Born on December 16, 1947, he passed away on December 12, 2012, at the age of 65 years.
We have truly lost a perfect gentleman, a kind-hearted human being, and a computer genius. May he rest in peace!
