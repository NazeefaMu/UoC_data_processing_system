Moves to guarantee administration officers’ rights

Measures will be taken to guarantee the professional rights and prestige of officers of the Public Administrative Service, said Public Administration and Management Minister Ranjith Madduma Bandara.
He said, as the subject minister, he had tendered a cabinet paper to rectify these issues.
He was addressing the annual general meeting of the All Island Administration Officers’ Union.
“Administration officers play a pivotal role in public administration but as the subject minister, I know that they face an issue with their professional rights and prestige,” the minister said.
He said although he presented the Cabinet paper, the deprived rights of administration officers cannot be guaranteed only on its own.
“However, the process has come to a standstill with the recommendations that has been made by the Finance Ministry,” Minister Bandara said. “Anyway, I would standby to win the rights of administrative officers’.”
He also said some public officers use their brawn rather than brain to get their problems solved. He added that some are doctors, employees of Water Board and Ceylon Electricity Board who attempt to take patients and consumers as hostage to get their things done. “These are incidents where the humane aspect of the public service is diminishing,” Minister Bandara said.
He pointed out that there are disparities in the public service. He added that an engineer of the Water Board and CEB gets a monthly payment of Rs. 200,000 to Rs. 300,000 while an engineer of the public service gets a salary of Rs. 70,000 to Rs. 80,000. The minister added that the government would take measures to solve these issues in public service.
