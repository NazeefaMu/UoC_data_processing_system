Minister, delegation meet with EP Governor

The Pottuvil Sub-Zonal Education Office would be transformed into a separate Zonal Education Office shortly, Industry and Commerce Minister Rishad Bathiudeen said.
A group of delegates led by Minister Rishad Bathiudeen, along with United People’s Alliance (UPA) General Secretary M. T. Hasen Ali, met with Eastern Province (EP) Governor Rohitha Bogollagama at his office, recently, to discuss matters related to a new zonal education office for Pottuvil as well as hospital, public market and playground development activities.
Governor Bogollagama assured that he would establish the sub-zonal education office as a separate office. “We requested the Governor to recruit employees from Pottuvil in order to reduce the unemployment rate in the area,” the minister said.
“The Pottuvil Intellectual Society is keen on the development of education and other sectors,” he added.
