Import Section of Ceylon Chamber of Commerce organizes seminar on March 22

As part of the efforts moving towards automation, Sri Lanka Standards Institution (SLSI) has taken steps to facilitate trade by introducing SLSI’s Online Submission of Notifications via a Single Window connectivity between the SLSI users and Sri Lanka Customs.
This automated system was developed by the Information Technology Management Department of Ministry of Finance and Mass Media. SLSI is now ready to go online.
A seminar, organized by the Import Section of the Ceylon Chamber of Commerce in collaboration with Ministry of Finance and Mass Media and SLSI, will be conducted to prepare users for the new operation.
This seminar, being held at the Ceylon Chamber of Commerce on March 22, provides the opportunity for importers, freight forwarders, clearing agents, traders, logistics providers, and all SLSI users the opportunity to learn how to use the new system. Areas that will be covered at the seminar include: registering with the new system; submitting applications online; deadlines to be met; submissions from overseas; payment methods; multiple and simultaneous submissions; response times; and system requirements from user end. Practical demonstrations will be provided at the seminar by SLSI and the IT Department of the Ministry of Finance and Mass Media.
The system of online submissions of applications carries numerous benefits to trade. Less visits results in costs being saved, information is accessible at just a click of a button, no more costly unnecessary paper work, no room for forgery, it is user-friendly and convenient, there is 24/7 documentation, service is streamlined and efficient.
The opportunity for users to familiarize themselves with the system is one not to be missed. Adaptation to the new system is essential for continuous improvement and for the ease of doing business.
