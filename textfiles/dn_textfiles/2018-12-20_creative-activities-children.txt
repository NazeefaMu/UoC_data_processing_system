Creative activities for children

Lanka Children’s and Youth Theatre Foundation (LCYTF) or popularly known as Somalatha Subasinghe Play House commences its next session of “Creative Activities for Children” programme on January 5, 2019.
The programme is open to children from ages four to fourteen. The prime objective of the programme is to develop the child’s mental stability and physical senses, to boost their artistic taste, and to keep alive the natural cheerfulness and playful sense of the child through aesthetic experiences. Therefore, this programme can be considered as an extracurricular learning that supplements the formal education the child obtains in school. The programme gives the child the opportunity to learn the basics of enjoying and appreciating music, free movements, dance and rhythmic movements, acting and language, art, singing, puppetry and handwork.
The programme is conducted by Kaushalya Fernando, Dr. Chandana Aluthge and Thiwanka Ranasinghe. Founded by the Late Somalatha Subasinghe in 1981, Lanka Children’s and Youth Theatre Foundation promotes theatre productions and performances meant specifically for children and youth.
Among its many functions is the training of actors, and research on theatre studies. Presently, the topmost institution for children’s and youth theatre productions in Sri Lanka, LCYTF has Since its inception produced a repertoire of mainly musical theatre for children and youth and mainstream art theatre productions which have been performed in the island as well as abroad.
This institution was incorporated in the parliament in January 2007 under the Act of Lanka Children’s and Youth Theatre Foundation, No. 3 of 2007 to further its quest for the young audiences in Sri Lanka.
