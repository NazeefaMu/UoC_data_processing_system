Showers and thundershowers after 2 PM

 
Showers or thundershowers will occur at several places in most provinces of the island after 2.00 p., the Meteorological Department said.
It said fairly heavy falls (of about 50mm) could be expected at some places, particularly in the Western, Sabaragamuwa, Central, North-western, North-central and Southern provinces.
