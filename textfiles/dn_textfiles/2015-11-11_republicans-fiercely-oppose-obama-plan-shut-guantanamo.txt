Republicans fiercely oppose Obama plan to shut Guantanamo

US: Congressional Republicans launched a pre-emptive strike Monday against a soon-to-be-released plan by President Barack Obama to shut down Guantanamo that would send dozens of detainees to US prisons.
Time is running out for Obama to make good on one of his top national security priorities: closing down the notorious detention facility, a symbol of the controversial counter-terrorism policies of his predecessor George W. Bush.
The administration has spent months working up a plan that would involve the transfer of roughly 50 of the remaining 112 prisoners to US prisons. The others, deemed less dangerous, would be transferred abroad.
Such an act, Republican lawmakers said, would be in “illegal” defiance of Congress, which since 2011 has passed legislation banning the Pentagon from using federal funds to bring the detainees to US soil.
The Pentagon is expected to soon release its plan assessing various US sites, spokesman Navy Captain Jeff Davis said Monday. “We have a plan that helps achieve the president's goal of closing Guantanamo and we are forwarding that plan to Congress very soon,” he said.
“Clearly the Congress's help is needed in doing this.”
The plan looks increasingly unlikely to pass muster in the Republican-controlled Congress, raising the prospect of executive action, which would ignite a political firestorm. At least four sites are under consideration: the US Disciplinary Barracks at Fort Leavenworth military base in Kansas; a federal prison in Florence and a state penitentiary in Canon City, both in Colorado; and a military brig in Charleston, South Carolina.
