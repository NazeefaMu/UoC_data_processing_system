Citizen Participatory Audit in the pipeline

The Auditor’s General’s Department is planning on implementing a Citizen Participatory Audit to enhance the performance, efficiency and effectiveness of the public sector service, Auditor General Gamini Wijesinghe said.
An evaluation system is being developed to assess how successfully a government institution has executed its responsibilities, the Auditor General said.
Wijesinghe was speaking at an event organised by the Colombo Municipal Council (CMC) at the Mayor’s Residence yesterday. In a participatory audit, the public gets the opportunity to air out their opinion on the government’s process of delivering service and government programmes.
“With a participatory audit, the citizens will give their judgement as to how satisfactorily the public administration has executed its responsibilities,” the Auditor General said.
“For example, the citizens will be able to assess how many times they have to come to a government institution to get some work done. They will reveal how much money they had to spend as bribes to get something done,” Wijesinghe said.
He said thus, in the near future, clear accounts provided by a public institute will not be the only yardstick used by the Auditor General to decide on a qualified opinion on an audit report of that institute.
“I will take public judgement as a benchmark before giving an opinion on an audit report,” the Auditor General said.
He also pointed out with the 19th amendment, the Auditor General’s Department has provisions to audit not only the accounts but also the services provided by government institutions.
“This amendment may seem a simple change but it is almost a controversial step.
With this amendment, the Auditor General can even audit the security service in a government institution,” the Auditor General pointed out.
The event was organised by the CMC on receiving for the first time after 42 years, a qualified opinion from the Auditor General’s Department on their audit report.
CMC Commissioner V.K.A.Anura pointed out for more than four decades, CMC has received an adverse opinion from the Auditor General on its audit report.
