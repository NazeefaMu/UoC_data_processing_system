Pakistan sends rice for drought-hit Sri Lanka

 
Pakistan today said it will send 10,000 metric tonnes of rice to Sri Lanka which is facing its worst drought in four decades.
The first shipment of the consignment will depart from Pakistan today and reach Sri Lanka on April 3.
The Foreign Office said Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif has directed authorities to provide all necessary assistance to the government and the drought-affected people in Sri Lanka.
"The procedure for dispatch of 10,000 metric tonnes of rice to Sri Lanka through containerised shipments has been initiated," it said.
"The Government and people of Pakistan stand shoulder to shoulder with the brotherly people of Sri Lanka in this hour of need and will continue to provide all possible support to them," it added.
Earlier, 25 metric tonnes of rice was airlifted to Colombo on February 8 as immediate short term assistance.
Sri Lanka is facing its worst drought in four decades with more than a million people experiencing acute water shortages, according to officials.
The shortage of rain last year has lowered water levels in rivers in parts of the country.
