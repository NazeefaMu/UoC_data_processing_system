[WEEDS]
FRIEND or Foe?

Remember how George Orwell's ‘Animal Farm’ ends with the maxim, “All animals are equal, but some animals are more equal?” Sad to say, this is true in a garden too. “All plants are equal. But some plants are more equal.”
Yes. You guessed right. Today we are going to talk about weeds: those plants that turn up like bad pennies in your garden even though those very plants are admired with great enthusiasm when they are seen in Wilpaththu or the Horton Plains as beautiful wildflowers or exotic shrubs: the kind that inspires the poet in us or brings to mind the poets we love: “There is a flower that shall be mine,It is the little Celandine...” wrote Wordsworth about the tiny yellow flower with eight petals which is categorized as a wild plant.
Yet, it goes without saying, weeds are pretty high on the list of things that annoy us as gardeners. Specially when they show up in even the most manicured garden: Specially when they don't just look out of place but compete with other plants for nutrients and moisture. Left to their own devices, they will weaken your vegetable or flower beds and choke them out of existence.

There is always the option of commercial weed killing products, of course, but if you really and truly love mother nature you would never even dream of using them in your garden. So what is a gardener to do about weeds?
Easy. You weed your weeds away. Weeding might turn out to be quite enjoyable, after all, provided you do it for just a minute or two, every now and then. Attacking gardens full of weeds however, can be a soul destroying task, especially when weeks later, they are back, bigger and stronger than before.
Skill
As Jason Hodges says in ‘Love your Garden: Weeds’ weeding is a skill and if done incorrectly, will only help stimulate growth. “Lots of weeds have tap roots so when you just rip off the foliage, the new plant that grows back has all that energy from the root to draw on,” explains Hodges. “That means it will grow faster and stronger than the part you removed. Other weeds like onion weed have a bulb and when you pull at it, it releases small seeds from the bulb that increase the amount of weeds you have - pull one onion weed out and you will have released about fifty seeds into the garden.”

There is an old saying, “See a weed, pull a weed”, meaning every time you see one, pull it out. Hodges however, says that as much as he likes this sentiment he disagrees with the technique. “Pulling at weeds just removes the foliage, leaving the root system to establish again.”
Using hand tools
All experts agree the most time-consuming but potentially the most rewarding way to get rid of your weeds is on your knees using small hand tools. The best time to hand weed is when the soil is damp so wait a day or two after heavy rain or after you have watered the garden. This loosens up the soil and lubricates the root system for easy removal. Two other important tools are, patience and perseverance!

Another way to combat weeds is by mulching. You can use a heavy layer of grass clippings, fallen leaves, and much more to create a barrier against weeds. Other than fighting weeds, mulch has many garden benefits including helping with moisture retention and reducing fungus. If you would rather keep mulching to a minimum, you can do so by using newspapers. Place yesterday's newspaper on your garden bed and follow up with a thin layer of mulch to tell your weeds to keep away. When the time is ready for planting, just punch a hole through the paper where your plant is to go.
Another useful item when it comes to weed prevention is cardboard. But the hitch with cardboard is that even though it does a good job of resisting weed growth, it can be difficult for water to reach the soil through a layer of cardboard. It is also harder to tear holes in for planting purposes, so you might want to make the holes in advance of laying the cardboard down. The good thing about cardboard is that it is plentiful (old milk powder boxes, shoe boxes packages that come whenever you purchase electronic goods etc) and is useful in creating garden walkways as well as stopping weed growth.
If you have them, old shower curtains too can be used as barriers against weeds. Spreading these useless items in garden paths or between rows will keeps weeds from showing their unwanted heads.
A substance that lacks the commercial chemicals but, still kills weeds is vinegar. The problem with this, however, is vinegar will also kill any other plants it comes in contact with, as well. To use it, put some in a spray bottle and spray only the target weeds you wish to eradicate. Be sure to use caution not to get it on any plants you wish to keep or else they, too, will be departing in a hurry.
Using boiling water
In much the same manner as vinegar, you can use boiling water, too. Simply pour the water where you wish it to go, to work on killing weeds. Boiling water will cook and kill the target plant, making it no longer a presence in your garden. However, in addition to killing weeds, boiling water can also take out the plants you wish to keep, not to mention severely burning you if you are not careful.
You can also use your plants themselves as a defense against weeds by planting in a pattern that chokes out weeds. Since weeds need sunlight to thrive as other plants do, avoid row planting and instead plant in blocks. This will make sunlight less available to weeds, and force them to grow in the shade which will greatly reduce both weed numbers and weed health.
Just like births, deaths, irresponsible three-wheel drivers and places of worship with blaring loudspeakers, weeds are a part of life you can't avoid.
But the good news is, there are many things you can do to heavily impact their growth. Give one or more of the methods above a try and chances are you will be happily eating from a garden that is in large part, weed free.
Or else, give the weeds too, a chance to live. Turn your backyard into a ‘weed garden’ as I did in these past three weeks of incessant rain.
As the saying goes, “if you can't beat them, join them.” It will be worth it. You will be feeding all the wildlife around you and if your weeds are the kind that doubles as wildflowers, you will still end up having a beautiful garden, too.
After all, as Ralph Waldo Emerson said, a weed is “a plant whose virtues have not yet been discovered.”
