The Signal..!

Now let me tell you I’ve had my fair share of cars over the past few years. They’ve all done me yeoman service and I’ve rewarded them by either sending them to another kindly owner or retiring them for life!
But there’s one in my stable who seems to have a permanent place: My scooter.
“Bob,” people ask as they come over to my house, “there’s an ancient machine downstairs?”
“Mine!” I say with pride.
“You not planning to dispose it?”
“Nope!”
“I guess there’s a story behind it!” they say and settle down to listen.
“If you notice,” I tell them, “it’s a scooter with a single long seat!”
“What’s that?”
“He means that unlike most scooters which have two single seats, one for the rider and the other for the pillion, this has one seat!” says somebody in the audience.
“Like a motorbike?”
“That’s it,” I say, “just like a motorbike!”
“And why so?” asks the same inquisitive person.
“So that the pillion rider and he can be as close as possible,” chuckles the other person and I smile. “Which means you must have carried a lot of pretty pillions Bob?”
I smile again. “I made a deal,” I said, “with my scooter that as soon as it decided it liked any one of my pillions it would signal me!”
“You mean like tell you, hey Bob, this is a good one?”
“Yep,” I said, “scooters know these things better than we men, they know how a woman fits in the back seat; is she selfish with her space, is she shy, abusive with the sides of the bike, caring, compassionate!”
“Scooters know all this?”
“You bet!” I said, “so there was Prema and Susan, Vera and Tina, Kamala and Geeta, but never once did my scooter utter a word!”
“She didn’t like them?”
“Didn’t feel they were good enough for me,” I smiled. “Till one day going up Malabar Hill she conked off!”
“With a pillion behind?”
“Yep,” I said, “and I cursed, and cussed, kicked and threw a silent tantrum, but it didn’t budge. Just refused to start on the middle of the hill!”
“So what happened?”
“We pushed the bike up the hill!”
“We?”
“Yes, the pillion rider helped me push!”
“She helped you?”
“She did,” I said, “and I swear as she helped me, I saw my scooter grin; “This Bob, is the woman who’ll love you like nobody else will!”
“So the conking off by your scoter was the signal?”
I smile and look at my wife who appears by my side: Today we’ve been married thirty- five years!” I say and then hear my scooter downstairs ask, “I didn’t let you down did I master?”
“You got me the best..!” I reply.
