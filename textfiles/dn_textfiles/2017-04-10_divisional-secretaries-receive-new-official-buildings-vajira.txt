Divisional Secretaries to receive new official buildings: Vajira

Home Affairs Minister Vajira Abeywardena said his ministry had introduced a programme to construct official buildings for the Divisional Secretaries.
He was addressing a meeting of government servants on April 8 at the Panadura Division Secretariat after laying the foundation stone to a three-storey building to house the office of the Secretariat. The construction will cost the government Rs. 11,100 lakh.
He said the aim of the project is to decentralise officials’ duties to provide a better service to the public on the instructions of President Maithripala Sirisena and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe.
“The Grama Rajya Concept mooted by the Prime Minister would be an excellent programme. It would add colours to the development programmes. The public could take part in this programme after its new rules and regulations are made known to the public soon,” he said.
The Government is to spend billions to construct the new buildings and renovate the existing ones, he said.
The minister said the country will not be divided or sold its parts to a foreign country. The Constitution has no clause that empowers someone to sell the country, he said. He said opponents of the government spread rumours that the LG election will be postponed. Former President Mahinda Rajapaksa had not taken steps to demarcate respective wards that resulted in the delay, the minister said.
The present Government has to correct it first to hold the LG elections.
He requested the public to cooperate with the Yahapalana Government to get their fair shares.
“All election promises would be fulfilled before the next general election. So Refrain from going after rumour mongers who opposed every good work of the Government,” he said.
The Minister said Panadura Urban Council Former Chairman and Panadura Electorate UNP Chief Organiser paid a glowing tribute to the Government for launching a range of development programmes in the electorate.
Skills Development and Vocational Training Minister Mahinda Samarasinghe, and Panadura Urban Council Former Chairman Nandena Gunatilleke participated.
