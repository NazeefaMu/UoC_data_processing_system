SLITHM to open tourism and hotel school in Jaffna

To cater to the growing industry manpower requirements in the tourism industry, Sri Lanka Institute of Tourism and Hotel Management (SLITHM) plans to commence a new facility in Jaffna by end 2017, SLITHM Chairman Sunil Dissanayake said.
This is in addition to its existing campuses in Colombo, Anuradhapura, Kandy, Bandarawela, Ratnapura, Koggala and Kurunegala. SLITHM has already opened facilities in Hambantota, Passikudah, Negombo and Polonnaruwa.
Moreover, an additional floor was added making a total of eight floors at the Colombo campus thereby increasing the class room capacity. SLITHM is currently in the process of reviewing and amending its current curricular to align it with current industry requirements by seeking the views and closely working with the Hotels Association of Sri Lanka.
“With the industry estimating nearly 150,000 new direct employees by 2020 to serve Sri Lanka’s growing visitor base. Last year alone we had 5,300 students at SLITHM. This year the planned output is 6,900.”
SLITHM has expanded its reach by establishing new campuses to attract young students into the industry and train unemployed youth in rural and suburban areas over the years and has earned local and global recognition as the premier institute for hospitality and tourism management education in Sri Lanka and the region that has produced leaders for employment in the industry, not only nationally but also internationally.
