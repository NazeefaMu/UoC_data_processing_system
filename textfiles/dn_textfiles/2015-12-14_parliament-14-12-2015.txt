Parliament incident:
Political parties must look into MPs’ discipline - PM
Political parties have to look into the discipline of Members of Parliament. Action should be taken against those who do not act accordingly, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said in Parliament on Saturday.
He said he came to know about the brawl in Parliament on Friday evening.
“Such things should not happen in Parliament,” Premier Wickremesinghe said. “The respective parties whether it is the SLFP or the UNP have to take disciplinary action against their members,” he said.
Prime Minister Wickremesinghe said a person informed him over the phone that the people who were in power during the previous regime assaulted them then, and they were now assaulting Muslim Members in Parliament.
He made this observation referring to the brawl in Parliament on Friday evening that took place during the speech of UNP MP Mujibur Rahuman.
The Prime Minister was speaking joining the Committee Stage Debate on the budget under the financial head of the Mass Media and Parliamentary Affairs Ministry.
Rahuman also raised a privilege matter over this matter in the morning, before the Premier made his speech.

Right to Information Act to be moved early next year - Gayantha
The historic Act of Right to Information will be moved by the government in the early months of next year, Mass Media and Parliamentary Affairs Minister Gayantha Karunatileka said in Parliament on Saturday.
“This is a great achievement of the country as it was moved after the change of a regime which was infamous for media freedom.”
He made these observations joining the Committee Stage debate on the Budget Proposal for fiscal year 2016 under the financial head of Mass Media and Parliamentary Affairs Ministry on Saturday.
“When we took over the government in January, there was an infamous and dark era for the mass media,” Minister Karunatileka said. “I am very pleased to speak at the wake of an era when total media freedom is guaranteed where nobody can claim of an incident of a single media personnel being murdered, being abducted by a white van, shaved forcibly, assaulted physically, fleeing from the country for protection, intimidated by phone or a media institution being set on fire”.
He said the government established after January 8 has brought media freedom and media personnel who fled the country were returning.
The minister said journalists have the freedom even to criticise the government and government members without fear.
“I would like to speak of the government media,” Minister Karunatileka said.“Even though some persons deliberately attempt to forget the government media, I would like to speak about them as they were highly politicised. They became trumpets of the government. They became institutions that criticised the opposition vehemently yet baselessly.”
He added that these media institutions had not only economically failed but had also been rejected by the public.
“Our concentration has been drawn to the welfare of media personnel,” Minister Karunatileka said. “As a person who has been the media spokesman for a main political party in the country for more than 10 years, I know the dreams of media personnel. I have a dream to fulfill those dreams of media personnel. I know they have housing problems. Some media personnel live in a temple, church, boarding or a rented house.”
The minister said a proposal for plots of lands was presented to the Cabinet of Ministers. The surveys on those plots are underway. Measures have been taken to grant a motorcycle at a relief price, he said.
He added that 2,000 media personnel qualified for this facility and they will be given motorcycles before the end of the year.
“The loan scheme given to media personnel engaged in higher education will be continued. One hundred fifty of this group, which is a section would be given this loan facility on December 18,” Minister Karunatileka said. “The Right to Information Bill was approved by the Cabinet of Ministers. The same will be presented to Parliament at the wake of next year”.
The minister said the golden era of Lake House was during 2001-2004.
He added that the UNP handed over the same to the incumbent government with savings of Rs. 289 million.
Karunatileka added that the same was returned with loans and bank OD of Rs. 800 million.
The new Chairman is taking efforts to enhance the economic situation of Lake House. Since January this year, the loans and OD has been reduced to Rs. 450 million, the minister said.
“Cricket telecast on Rupavahini was given to CSN for fatherly love. However I submitted a Cabinet paper to grant the same back to Rupavahini,” Minister Karunatileka said.
“Rupavahini is gaining momentum now due to its balance news coverage. It gives equal opportunities to all political parties now.”
He said ITN considered to be the family channel had turned unfortunately to be a ‘Channel of One Family’.
He added that equal advertisement opportunities were given to all political parties during the election period.
The minister added that SLBC was also becoming the heart of the nation.
“We could make all these achievements as we could get all these institutions rid of political intervention,” Minister Karunatileka said. “I have been in Parliament for 15 years. Nobody can claim that I have been involved in corruption. We are clean and ready to leave everything when we quit.”
He said everything with regard to the Government Press was coming back to normal.
The minister added that the media reported that the COPE report of the previous regime revealed about corruption in the Government Press.
“Parliament reforms come under me. You can see various reforms in the near future. The funds and facilities for Members are to be increased. The members’ staff will be provided training,” Minister Karunatileka said.
“The former Media Minister has not been able to join the debate. I feel sorry for that.”
He said a house was set up for a journalist who crushed to death by an elephant. His house was provided with furniture by the ‘Bauddya Channel’, the minister said
He added that this government was free from corruption.

Electricity for all Sri Lankans soon - Siyambalapitiya
Power and Renewable Energy Minister Ranjith Siyambalapitiya said in Parliament on Saturday that the government aims to provide electricity to all Sri Lankans in due course.
“We hope to provide an uninterrupted 24 hour electricity supply augmented by renewable energy generation,” Minister Siyambalapitiya said, joining the committee stage debate of the budget under financial heads of the Power and Renewable Energy Ministry and the Petroleum Resources Development Ministry.
“We are proud to say that Sri Lanka is the only country in South Asia with a 24-hour uninterrupted supply of electricity. Electricity supply to households is over 98 percent and there are 150,000 households yet to be connected to the national grid. These households will be provided with electricity by next January,” he said.
The minister said on the instructions of President Maithripala Sirisena, all government institutions have been requested to save 10 percent of their electricity consumption following a better electricity conservation plan and then conduct a proper valuation of power conversation.
“The CEB expects to earn an income of Rs. 15,000 million at the end of this year following the power saving programmes. We are keen on generating power from renewable energy sources in a manner that had a minimal impact on the environment,” he said.
Formulate systematic programme to meet rural communities’ energy needs - Pavithra
UPFA MP Pavithra Wanniarachchi said amendments were brought to the Electricity Act during her time to provide loan facilities to the poor to get electricity at nominal rates.
Under this project, people of low income groups were able to get electricity connections on an easy payment system. A systematic programme should be formulated to meet energy needs of rural communities living in off-grid areas of the country, she said.
Energy sector should be controlled only by govt - Anura Kumara
DNA MP Anura Kumara Dissanayake said in a country like ours the energy sector should be controlled by only the government.
“The sole right to import tar was held by the CPC until now. But, this budget has removed that monopoly. We are against it. There is a move to entirely take away the energy sector from the government,” he said.
No profits at CPC due to hedging deals - Yapa
Disaster Management Minister Anura Priyadarshana Yapa said the former government did not increase the prices of fuel even though the fuel prices in the world market were increased on several occasions.
This issue resulted in a loss to the CPC. The loss incurred by the CPC also largely increased due to providing the CEB fuel stocks at concessionary prices to generate electricity. The CPC would have earned profits, if it has not lost money through “hedging” deals, he said.
Sub-standard petrol imported during previous regime - Gayantha
Parliamentary Reforms and Mass Media Minister Gayantha Karunathilaka said when the corrupt Rajapaksa regime swindled money from the oil business even when oil prices fell record low in the world market depriving the people of the opportunity to get fuel at cheaper rates.
Even though the Supreme Court ordered to reduce petrol prices by Rs. 100, the former government refused to do so.
The CPC suffered a Rs. 600 million loss due to the corrupt hedging deal. The sub-standard petrol imported into the country by the previous government also resulted in engine failure and required replacement of costly pumps and injectors.
Hundreds of vehicle owners and petrol station managers suffered loses as a result of low quality petrol being released to the market, he said.
“The government suffered a huge loss due to these reasons. We revived the institution which incurred heavy loses. But, we have been able to reduce the fuel prices and gave relief to the people several times after the new government came into power,” the minister said.
Lanka looking to increase installed renewable energy capacity - Ajith
Deputy Minister of Power and Renewable Energy Ajith P. Perera said Sri Lanka is looking to increase the installed renewable energy capacity over the next two decades, as the country’s power regulator draws up a new long-term policy.
The CEB plans to increase the renewable energy capacity to 972 MW by 2020, which would contribute 20 percent to the total power generation in the country. Renewable energy share in power generation is expected to peak in 2025 at 21.4 percent with an installed capacity of 1,367 MW.
Corruption at CPC during previous regime - Anoma
Deputy Minister of Petroleum Resources Development Anoma Gamage said corruption and malpractices had risen to unimaginable heights in the CPC during the former regime.
“We will create an environment where the CPC will be free of corruption political influence,” she said.

Previous govt.’s infamous rule reflected by media behaviour - Paranavithana
The dictatorial, indiscipline and infamous rule of the previous government were reflected by the behaviour of the media, said Mass Media and Parliamentary Affairs Deputy Minister Karunaratne Paranavithana in Parliament on Saturday.
He said the same situation was subjected to a drastic change within few weeks of the historic change they brought about in January this year.
He made these observations yesterday joining the Committee Stage debate on the Budget Proposal for fiscal year 2016 under the financial head of Mass Media and and Parliamentary Affairs Ministry.
Paranavithana said Editor Lasantha Wickramathunga was murdered in a high security zone. Ekneligoda disappeared while Poddala Jayantha was assaulted. Many journalists fled from the country, he said.
“Some ministers rushed to media institutions and created pandemonium by assaulting employees,” the deputy minister said. “There was media suppression in various ways. We have passed a period even when private media institutions were influenced by dictatorial rule”.
He added that the responsibility of the Mass Media Ministry is to develop mass media in the country as an industry while protecting the media freedom. “The Mass Media Ministry has plans to commence digitalisation of the Film Corporation as well as the Mass Media Ministry by next year,” Deputy Minister Paranavithana said.
