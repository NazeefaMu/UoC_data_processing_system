4rever Skin Naturals launch  4rever SadhaRekawaranaya CSR platform

 4rever Skin Naturals initiated its CSR platform, ‘4rever Sadha Rekawaranaya’ with a programme at the Tamil Mixed School in Chavakachcheri on the sidelines of the Jaffna International Trade Fair recently.
4rever Skin Naturals served as the beauty partner at the Jaffna International Trade Fair. As part of the CSR programme, 4rever renovated the cooking facilities at the Tamil Mixed School in Chavakachcheri and gifted its students with school bags, books as well as shoes and socks.
Prior to renovation, the cooking facilities were in a dilapidated and a hygienically poor condition. The decision to renovate this particular building sprang from the genuine desire to help the school children enjoy nutritious and hygienic meals in future. In addition, 4rever hosted an inspiring motivational and guidance session targeting all the students at the school including 17 children suffering from some form of learning disability as well as children who have been identified as a slow-learner.
“It was an inspiring as well as a heartfelt occasion for all of us at 4rever Skin Naturals. Seeing the children's faces light up with happy smiles and teachers and parents too smile warmly in response was wonderful.
We all returned home with a warm feeling deep inside our hearts knowing that the children will be able savour wholesome food made in a safe and a clean environment in future,” 4rever Skin Naturals Founder and Chairperson Chandhani Bandara said .
Commenting on the CSR platform she added,”As a truly Sri Lankan company with vested interest in the country's socio-economic progress, we strive to assist communities that are in need of help. 4rever is a local brand that has always focused on the community that we operates-in.We plan to penetrate into hereto untouched parts of the Island to make a meaningful impact on the lives that we touch, Our sole vision is to serve segments that may be ignored for the simple reason of the beneficiary pool being too small.
In line with 4rever SadhaRekawaranaya, CSR vision a portion of revenue generated from each product sale made by 4rever Skin Naturals will be allocated into the Chandhani Bandara Foundation fund which looks to assist communities that are yet to benefit from Government or private CSR programmes.
“4rever has always believed that the community plays a vital role in our business and its output. As a practice we purchase herbal ingredients from community-based out-growers. Every 4rever consumer becomes a part of this initiative as part of the earnings we make from sale of each product will be allocated to our CSR efforts,” 4rever Skin Naturals CEO Priyantha Abeyratne said.
