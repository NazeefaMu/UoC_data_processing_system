Wild elephants rampage across villages in Ampara

Wild elephants invade in large numbers the villagers of Thirukkovil, Irakkamam, Ampara, Valathapiddy, Kuduvil, Dheegawappiya, Nintavur, Pottuvil, Akkaraipattu, Addalaichenai, and Alayadivembu, the residents of the areas complain.
They destroy paddy cultivations, and domestic crops, they said.
The wild elephants even enter houses and ruin harvest stocked there and destroy walls, they said.
The residents say they spend nights in jungles and their children cannot concentrate on their studies in fear of wild elephants. They said they had complained about the issue to authorities many a time in vain.
They launched a protest recently in the Thirukkovil DS Division demanding that immediate actions be taken to protect them from wild elephants.
