Committee to look into appeals for delimiting - Faiszer

 
More than 400 appeals have been received for delimitation, Provincial Councils and Local Government Minister Faiszer Mustapa said.
He said the reason for receiving that many appeals was because delimiting does not occur in a proper manner.
"I have decided to hold an all-party meeting to discuss how to proceed with delimiting in a proper manner. That way all delimiting issues will be solved," he said. The meeting is scheduled to be held on December 11.
Minister Mustapa said that he had appointed a five member committee to inquire into delimitation issues. The inquiry into appeals began on the December 1.
The Commission is expected to summarize the appeals and present a report to the minister on December 15.
