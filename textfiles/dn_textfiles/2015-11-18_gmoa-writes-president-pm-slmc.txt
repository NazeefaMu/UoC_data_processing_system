GMOA writes to President, PM on SLMC

The Government Medical Officers’ Association (GMOA) has sent a letter to the President, Prime Minister and to the Health Minister in connection with safeguarding integrity of Sri Lanka Medical Council (SLMC), GMOA sources said.
According to the sources, SLMC is the statutory body responsible for upholding standards of medical profession. It conducted its duties with integrity and fairness in the past. However, since the recent past there is a trend of abusing this prestigious institution to take revenge on its own members, especially office bearers of GMOA.
Recent inquiries have been initiated mainly under the clause of “Professional Misconduct”.
However, matters being inquired as “Professional Misconduct” include comments made on social media and events which took place at a trade union meeting. Above actions are protected by individuals’ constitutional rights to freedom of expression and right to take part in trade union activities.
“Hence, inquiring them is beyond the purview of SLMC and violates constitutional rights, the sources said.
The inquiries are deliberately dragged on without a verdict for years causing professional, academic, financial and personal damage to the members.
Many complains received in connection with some council members abuse the powers vested in SLMC. As such, GMOA would be compelled to take all measures against SLMC to safeguard the rights of its members.
