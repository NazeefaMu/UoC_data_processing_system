[APPRECIATIONS - (14-05-2018)]

Chandrakala Ratnayake
She was courageous
Time shall heal they say; but to me, time has only been intensifying the aching wound of my beloved mother’s absence in this world. She was the special person who brought light into my life from the day I was born, not only in times of joy, but in times of deep sorrow and struggle. Even though she had been gone throughout one year, which to me, felt like a lifetime, I still feel her ray of light falling on me from heaven above. But I admit with pain that the challenging moments have been appalling without Ammi’s presence, while the dainty moments of joy have been dull throughout the year that passed-by.
My beloved mother departed this world on May 12, 2017, after courageously fighting an ailment that was discovered, treated for and persisted for three short-lived months, leaving my father and I only the consolation that her duration of anguish was minimal. The robust, courageous, good-looking and strong-willed lady in my mother did bear, void of complaint, the complications involved with an ailment of the nature. She set an example by not giving up until her last breath at the Kurunegala hospital’s Coronary Care Unit, to which she was transferred from the Oncology Unit. We all were drained due to the varying magnitudes of her illness during those three months. My memory holds on tight with desolation, to the last nine hours that my mother fought for dear life. “Life breaks everyone, but some people heal stronger in the breaks,” they say and my mother was one of those who healed stronger in the breaks.
My mother lived a complete and dynamic life. Amongst the seven siblings of the Senanayake family from Kurunegala, she was the fourth. Having obtained her education from Maliyadeva Girls’ College in Kurunegala, she joined the Hayleys Group back in the 1960’s, where she served for nine years.
While in school and during later years, she played basketball under the guidance of All-India Basketball Coach P. Chelladurai and also represented St. Anne’s College, Kurunegala, in a trainee camp held at the St. Anthony’s College Courts in Katugastota back in the 1960’s.
After tying the knot with my father Ananda Ratnayake in 1973, she pursued a career at Marhaba Travels in Sharjah, UAE, where she served for several years before returning to Sri Lanka. Being the family-oriented woman, later in her life, she, along with my father, lived with me in California, USA and in Sri Lanka, until her passing.
The grief of my mother’s demise had been continuously suffocating my soul throughout the past year, letting the tears fall silently down my cheeks, every single day, not for the world to perceive.
Death has left heartache in me that no one can heal. Time has just taught me how to live with the pain and face this riddle called life in the absence of my mother’s warmth and care. Yet, I am aware that ammi, you are watching over me and appachchi from somewhere over the rainbow. You are my Mona Lisa and you will always be beautiful in my eyes!

S. P. Abeysingha
Exemplary individual
The sudden demise of S. P. Abeysingha of Parakandeniya, was a shock to his friends and relations. After retiring from the position of Inland Revenue Department Deputy Commissioner, he was practicing Buddhist meditation and helping others to learn and practice meditative processes as well.
S. P. Abeysingha (Abey to his friends) was an exemplary individual who always upheld and promoted positive moral qualities such as integrity, honesty and equanimity in whomever he came into with.
After a brilliant school career at Galahitiyawa Central College, he entered the clerical service after his A/Levels. He was in the batch of students who had to do their O Levels in Sinhala and switch over to English for their A Levels.
He faced the challenge with courage and endurance, motivating his colleagues to do the same and came out with flying colours. Barriers and challenges in life were no limiting factors to his progress. He was instrumental in helping the school in numerous fundraising activities through the Past Pupils’ Association, in which he was Secretary during the 1980's. The funds were utilised for the requirements of underprivileged children.
His dedication to the work and responsibilities entrusted to him, were recognised by his superiors, enabling him to rise in his career in the Internal Revenue Department.
Though he started out as a clerical officer, he was promoted to staff ranks over a short time and finally became a Deputy Commissioner prior to his retirement. Abey was a keen student of Buddhism and lived by its principles, showing the way to correct Buddhist practices to his friends, colleagues and anybody who sought his counsel. He visited numerous places local and abroad, to obtain first-hand information on insight-meditation form gurus and leaders of those institutions. The extensive knowledge and experience gathered by him were shared with his fellow men.
Abey was a sincere friend and an exemplary citizen. May he attain the Supreme Bliss of Nibbana!

Vernon Gunasekara Jr.
He possessed a heart of gold
Does a name speaks for itself? In most instances, the answer would be no. But in the case of Vernon Malik Akbar Gunasekara, the answer was always yes; his name spoke for itself in volumes.
Vernon was a great man and a faithful friend who cared for all who was near and dear to him. He was a true gentleman with a heart of gold, always putting the needs of others before his own. An Attorney-at-Law, a writer and author, Vernon or Verna, as we used to call him, was called to rest on April 10, 2018, at the age of 53.
Born on May 31, 1964, to a Christian pater and a Malay mater, he practiced all religions sans discrimination. During the month of Ramadan, Vernon, as a true believer, carried out fasting to the letter.
He always celebrated Christmas and furthermore, I myself have witnessed him observing sil on two occasions.
He received his early education at St. Anthony's College, Kandy, of which the motto was Lux de Coelo, meaning a light from heaven; which he himself was to his alma mater. Upon completing his G. C. E. A/L's, he joined the Sri Lanka Law College, whereby popular majority, he was elected the Law Students' Union Vice-President. Back then, the Law-Medical was a single day event. Cricket and netball matches between law and medical students followed by a dinner-dance, was the order of the day. It was under Verna that it was turned into a Law-Medical Week.
The Peradeniya University Akbar hall was erected to commemorate Justice Akbar; Verna's grand-uncle. Sir Oliver Gunathilake was the maternal uncle of Verna's late father; Vernon Gunasekara Sr.
He was one of the founding members of Lanka Sama Samaja Party and was also its first secretary. Being an ideologist in Communism and Trotskyism, he assisted lawyer H. V. Perera in the famous Bracegirdle Case. Our Verna's cross-examination skills were impeccable in the Abanwala acid attack case. Even his opponents admired the tolerance and endurance he practiced during the trial of the Gampola bomb incident. His legal arguments were par excellence. His absence would leave a void within his friends.
Is there any possibility to share someone's knowledge after his death? The possibility of that impossibility was Verna's last wish. He had requested his wife Suneetha to open a library in his name at their residence. Vernon never hesitated to enjoy the worldly pleasures this world had to offer. His scholarly knowledge in any subject made him a man who could wine with kings and still dine with commoners.
May his soul find peace!
Nanda Senanayake, Attorney-at-Law
