Today is World Cities Day
Better City,  Better Life

The city is where most of us live and work. The city today is home to much of humanity. In recognition of the City’s special place in our lives, the United Nations has designated today (October 31) as World Cities Day.
The general theme of World Cities Day is Better City, Better Life, while each year a different sub-theme is selected, to either promote successes of urbanization, or address specific challenges resulting from urbanization. This year, the United Nations has selected the theme Building Sustainable and Resilient Cities because cities need support to become resilient and develop their capacity to absorb the impact of hazards, protect and preserve human life and limit damage and destruction of public and private assets while continuing to provide infrastructure and services after a crisis.
Every week, 1.4 million people around the world move to cities in addition to the transient population on working days. Such rapid urbanization can strain local capacities, contributing to increased risk from natural and human made disasters. But hazards do not need to become disasters. The answer is to build resilience -- to storms, floods, earthquakes, fires, pandemics and economic crises.
City planners
Cities around the world are already acting to increase resilience and sustainability. Bangkok has built vast underground water storage facilities to cope with increased flood risk and save water for drier periods. In Quito, the local government has reclaimed or protected more than 200,000 hectares of land to boost flood protection, reduce erosion and safeguard the city’s freshwater supply and biodiversity. And in Johannesburg, the city is involving residents in efforts to improve public spaces so they can be safely used for recreation, sports, community events and services such as free medical care. Cape Town has an aggressive programme to conserve water. Colombo too has an ongoing flood mitigation programme.
More than half of all people live in cities and planned human settlements, and that proportion is projected to grow to two thirds by 2050 when the world population will reach nine billion from today’s seven billion. Urban areas already are hubs of energy, innovation and economic dynamism. Using these factors as a template, city planners must design cities for the future with resilience in mind.
There is already buzzword for future cities – they will be “smart cities” where everything and everyone will be connected via the Internet of Things (IoT) concept, although many experts have raised security and privacy concerns. In fact, a recent report issued in the USA predicted that Cities around the world could spend as much as US$ 41 trillion on smart technology over the next 20 years. The market for smart city technology is predicted to reach US$ 760 billion in just four years.
Traffic snarls will be a thing of the past with driverless cars that can communicate with road signals and with each other. With cities becoming virtually collision free, there will be massive savings in terms of insurance and health costs. There will also be no need to own a car when you can call up a driverless car at any time – which will also obviate the need for most parking spaces which can then be used for other purposes.
Energy will be supplied mostly or only by renewable sources. New power grids will use two-way communication between the utility and customers to make more efficient use of energy. All waste materials will be recycled via solar-powered trash compactors. Most people will be able to work from home via always-on connectivity, which will further reduce the need for personal transport.
It is clear that the public sector alone will not be able to accomplish all these, which will cost billions of dollars in the long run. There is a clear case here for Public-Private Partnerships. The authorities should form a broad network of stakeholders to turn our key cities to smart cities.
Colombo is seeing a rapid transformation and will look much different in just four or five years – scores of high rise buildings are coming up, new flyovers are taking shape and unseen aspects such as sanitation are getting as makeover. Colombo is already home to nearly one million permanent and transiting residents and the figures will go higher as rural to urban migration continues.
The city is the pivot on which the economy revolves and in Colombo’s case, it is responsible for a good part of the country’s economic performance. But for all its importance, Colombo has basically been an unplanned city with ad-hoc developments that had not taken future population and other projections into account. Now we have an opportunity to correct these mistakes and build back better so that the entire city populace will benefit.
Planned urbanization maximizes the capacity of cities to generate employment and wealth, and to foster diversity and social cohesion between different classes, cultures, ethnicities and religions. Cities designed to live together create opportunities, enable connection and interaction, and facilitate sustainable use of shared resources. Local urban planners have now taken these concerns on board not only in the case of Colombo, but also for Kandy, Trincomalee, Jaffna and Galle among others.
Key initiatives
It is a vision for cities that are safe, accessible, affordable, resilient and sustainable, which is just what we want to see in a city such as Colombo. City planners worldwide will also have to address problems such as crime, drugs, pollution and poverty which have taken their toll on hundreds of millions of city-dwellers.
Over the next few decades, urbanization will be driven by several key initiatives - the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, the Agenda for Humanity, the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction and the Paris Agreement on Climate Change.
The term “Anthropocene” has been used to describe the times we live in because it is an era indelibly shaped by human activity. The “Anthropocene” is fundamentally marked by urbanization. Data from the World Bank shows that in 2017, 54.7% of the world’s population – 4.1 billion people – lived in urban areas.
Asia is home to many of the world’s mea cities. The Beijing- Tianjin- Qinhuangdao corridor has a population of over 100 million. In the future, there will be a sprawl of mega urban centres from Beijing to Bangkok to Jakarta to Mumbai. Although cities across Asia are growing apace, only three (Singapore, Tokyo, and Kobe) are in the top 50 of the Mercer Quality of Life index. Singapore offers the best quality of life of all Asian cities, according to the Survey. Colombo is the highest ranked South Asian city, but still occupies only the 137th place out of 231 cities. At least 15 Asian cities are in the bottom 50 of this ranking. The challenge before Asian leaders is to make these Asian cities livable for the present and the future.
Cities face a myriad of challenges from overpopulation to traffic, but all these problems have answers and solutions. City planners and Government authorities must work together to resolve the problems and present viable solutions. Sustainability is the keyword as cities brace for the future. If we fail to address these dire problems right now, the future will be bleak for the next generations. Our cities deserve a better deal with an eye on the future.
