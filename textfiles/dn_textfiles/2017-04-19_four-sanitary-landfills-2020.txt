Four sanitary landfills by 2020

Four sanitary landfills are to be constructed in Jaffna, Hikkaduwa, Anuradhapuara and Polonnaruwa, Central Environmental Authority (CEA) Waste Management Division Eng. J M U Indrarathne said.
He said landfill technology has been promoted as an integrated solution to the solid waste management in the country. He said the four landfills would be operational by 2020.
“The proposed landfills would be the final destination of the waste collected in each of the four districts. Jaffna, Hikkaduwa and Anuradhapura landfills have the capacity to accommodate 50 tons of waste per day while Polonnaruwa landfill can accommodate about 20 tons per day. The life period of all these landfill sites will be over 10 years,” he said.
He said the designing and planning have been completed in the four project sites, adding that the tender process would commence shortly. He said the construction of four landfills is funded by Korean Exim Bank with a counterpart funding from the Sri Lankan Government. The total project cost has been estimated at about USD 38 million.
“The Sri Lankan Government is responsible for providing logistics, electricity, access roads and security,” he said. The country’s first sanitary landfill constructed in Maligawatte, Dompe with technical and financial assistance from Korea was opened towards the end of 2014. Indrarathne said the operations of this landfill site were being conducted successfully.
“This landfill can accommodate about 90 tons of waste per day, but we are currently receiving only about 10 tons per day. The waste collected in Dompe area is disposed in this site,” he added.
