South Asian Travel Awards for two Uga Bay boutique hotels

Uga Bay and Chena Huts, part of Sri Lanka’s leading boutique hotel chain Uga Escapes’,recently brought home two South Asian travel awards at the South Asian Travel Awards, 2017
The Uga Escapes hotel chain, one of the island’s most diverse, exclusive and opulent, swept away two awards at the South Asian Travel Awards held recently in Male, Maldives. Both Uga Bay and Chena Huts, two of their star properties,were recognised and honoured at the event for their superior hospitality efforts, not just with regards to their exceptional customer service, but also vigilance in the awareness and implementation of sustainable business practices whenever and wherever possible. Chena Huts and Uga Bay were respectively awarded the Leading Wildlife Resort in Sri Lanka, and the Leading Boutique Resort in Sri Lanka/ Leading Luxury Resort in Sri Lanka.
Uga Bay which is perched on the edge of sunny, resplendent Passikudah, is a tropical haven all of its own, and has enamoured many a tourist over the years. Overlooking some of the most stunning beaches strung along a palm-fringed coastline, the setting is captivatingly idyllic, and in some ways surreal especially when backed with acute customer care. Elegant, luxurious, exceedingly comfortable and a true escape, Uga Bay also offers an underground spa and sumptuous cuisine, prepared from locally sourced ingredients whenever and wherever possible. With 46 expansive, well-decked out rooms and 2 plush suites on offer, Uga Bay is ideal for travellers from all walks of life, be they solo, honeymooners or families. Each of the rooms and suites also offer panoramic views of Passikudah Bay just beyond.
Chena Huts, one of their more recent additions,takes you to the heart of Sri Lanka’s diverse wilderness without compromising on luxury. Guests are given a glimpse of Yala, world renowned for its spectacular array of wildlife, particularly the Sri Lankan leopard. Uga Escapes helps its clients explore the island’s second-largest nature reserve up-close, whilst indulging in contemporary facilities, including detached private pavilions, irresistible cocktails, delectable food, and climate-controlled living spaces. With just fourteen1130sqft cabins to choose from and built-in 5m private plunge pools, utmost privacy and tranquillity is assured to all guests. Each of the cabins have been inspired by and designed based on the traditional concept of ‘chena’ cultivation, a practice deeply seeped in the roots of local tradition. This allows Chena Huts to effortlessly blend into the background and culture, morphing with the jungle surroundings all round for a seamless experience.
