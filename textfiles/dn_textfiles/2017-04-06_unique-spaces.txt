Unique spaces


We need spaces for meditation. We need spaces that will soothe us- spaces that will refresh and calm us., spaces that will elevate us to a consciousness where we are completely detached from the worries in life. ArchWorld speaks to Archt. (Major) Chintaka Kanchana Nikapitiya on spaces created for calmness.
“Continuous dialogue with nature, casting shadows with sunlight, cascading water bodies, and reflecting ponds will relax your mind. Better to keep the internal space cool and maintain more indoor comfort levels with continuous cross ventilation,” said Nikapitiya
We need to feel refreshed, after we come out of a world largely demanding. And let’s face it commuting in Sri Lanka is not devoid of dust and grime. We need to come back to coolness, comfort and solitude.
“Sustainable design approach, and by adopting passive design strategies we may be able to utilize maximum natural sunlight & wind,” stated Nikapitiya.
Colors are incredibly effective when we want to create an ‘effect’. From a variety of colors we can use the most suitable colors to create that sense of elevation. That sense of transcendence.
“This may differ from project to project and depend on the client’s preference. Personally I prefer to go with earth color tones with variety. Always I work very closely with the client in color selection,” pointed out Nikapitiya.
In our home we have to be totally and absolutely in control. Our home is our kingdom. We can use so many methods to create a feeling of wholeness
“Sounds of birds, sound of cascading water will relax a person’s mind. Internal court yards with water features, creating spaces and link with gardens will do this,” explained Nikapitiya.
Artificial intelligence
Artificial intelligence is the next new step in science. It is the next big dream where life is made simpler due to the service of computers.
“Computers will not be able to take Architect’s Place. Concept or Philosophy behind any architectural work has to come from the human/architect’s mind. Computer is a machine /tool which will support the architect to express his thinking more effectively and accurately. Computer is a very effective tool to analyze more complex situations, models and give projections using available data,” added Nikapitiya
We live in a consumerist culture. And therefore there are so many distractions. However an Architect through experience knows exactly what is needed and so can guide the client into what is necessary.
“I think rest, relaxation, belonging, identity, security are basic needs of a person. Hiring an architect is a symbolic and prestigious thing for a person, which is one reason that people hire an architect without doing the job themselves. Of course there are other reasons for hiring an architect, the main reason being expertise and a job excellently done. The architect will provide the solution for the deeper needs of a human,” explained
Nikapitiya Lifespan
Everything has a lifespan. We have a lifespan and our creations have a lifespan. Life is largely transient.
“Every building has a life span, Life cycle. We have to design buildings considering the life cycle factor of each element of the building. However the concept behind a creation may timeless,” informed Nikapitiya
The contents of the mind have been perused by the architect. He has the experience and he knows the ways of the client.
“We have been trained to understand the client’s mind. In the discussion we can gather information about the real need for a particular client. So we can come out with design options with 3d visuals, Models, Animations, Walk-Throughs, & stimulations, which the client can decide before building physically at site,” shared Nikapitiya
Truly the joy of creation can only be realized when you hire an architect. He is the grandmaster of the design. The understanding that passes through the client and the architect is intrinsic to the design.
“Designing is a problem solving exercise. Each problem has a specific solution. A creation has to be unique. Solution has to be very simple. “Less Is More” Live /design more close with nature within logical /practical parameters will always bring joy, comfort & satisfaction to one’s mind,” pointed out Nikapitiya.
Unique language
Designing in the tropics gives an architect his own unique language. This language translates into a design.
“My designs revolve around long eves, verandahs for relaxation. Large volumes of spaces, maximize natural light and ventilation. Flexible & multi-functional spaces, court yards, spaces which link to external & internal gardens. Green terraces & vertical gardens are some key features and elements in domestic scale designs. Yes, it’s time to think and implement in a sensible way without destroying Sri Lankan uniqueness,” added Nikapitiya
Nikapitiya enjoys his architecture. He especially enjoys spaces that add more value to the clients’ aspirations. Every creation is unique because it involves its own set of challenges.
“Yes, I really enjoy it. It’s a unique feeling that comes to one’s mind in relation to a character of a particular space. Character/ Language of the space or sequence of spaces may depend on the scale, volume, color, texture. Solutions involve designing climatic responsive buildings. More sustainable building structures would be the solution,” summed up Nikapitiya .
