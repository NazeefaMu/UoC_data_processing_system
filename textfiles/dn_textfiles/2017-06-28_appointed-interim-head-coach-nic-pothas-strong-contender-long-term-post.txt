Appointed interim head coach Nic Pothas a strong contender for long term post

South African-born Nic Pothas appointed as interim head coach of the Sri Lanka team for the upcoming series against Zimbabwe and India is being looked at as a long term coach as well according to Sri Lanka Cricket.
In confirming Pothas’ appointment as interim head coach, Sri Lanka Cricket president Thilanga Sumathipala, said, “We have every confidence that Nic Pothas can take on the role of head coach and carry on that’s why we have appointed him for the Zimbabwe and India series. We have a strategic plan to engage the next coach and Nic Pothas is also a good contender for it. There are professional coaches who are currently engaged and shown a lot of interest and we are confident we will have one at the end of the Indian tour. We will not have to look too far to find somebody who will be competent to take this team till the 2019 World Cup.”
Pothas was engaged as a fielding coach of the national team on August 8 and following the shock resignation of Graham Ford as head coach after the Champions Trophy he has been promoted to undertake the role of interim head coach in addition to his duties as fielding coach.
Sumathipala also said that there were also Sri Lanka Cricket coaches who have shown interest in the job but added, “We will have to first discuss with our cricket committee and our support team the plan and structure - what kind of coach that we are looking at. When we looked at Dav Whatmore he was a developing coach, he could develop an ordinary team to a world class side.
There are coaches very good at looking after professional advanced ongoing teams. We have to make an assessment on the situation and deploy the right person with the right spirit.”
