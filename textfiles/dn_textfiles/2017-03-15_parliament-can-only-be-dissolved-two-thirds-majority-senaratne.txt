Parliament can only be dissolved with two third's majority: Senaratne

According to the provisions of the 19th Amendment, even the President cannot dissolve the Parliament. A two third's majority is required to dissolve Parliament, Health Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne said.
He was addressing the gathering after handing over appointment letters and degree certificates for 336 dispensers and 150 midwives during a ceremony held in Colombo, recently.
According to Dr. Senaratne, the government has received a mandate from the people to run until 2020.
The trade unions should act without becoming the mallets of various political projects, he added.
He said, present day politicians engage in politics using trade unions, but the benefits are short-term. Some trade unions try to bring the persons who destroyed the country's economy back into power.
Officials of the Health Ministry and other institutions were also present.
