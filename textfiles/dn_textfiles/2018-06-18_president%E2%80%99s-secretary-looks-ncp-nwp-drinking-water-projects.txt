President’s Secretary looks into NCP, NWP drinking water projects

Locating suitable water sources for drinking water projects in the North Central and North Western Provinces has been a problem.
President Maithripala Sirisena has instructed the President’s Secretary Austin Fernando to give priority to solving this problem, in consultation with government agents, chief secretaries in the relevant provinces, and the ministries of water supply, irrigation and water resources management, and Mahaweli development.
A number of discussions have been held in this connection convened by the President’s Secretary with relevant stakeholder agencies.
As a result of the discussions, it has been decided to obtain the water required for the implementation of Anuradhapura North and Trincomalee mega water supply projects from Mahawilachchiya and Kudawilachchiya tanks and the Yan Oya.
On the instructions of the President’s Secretary, the NWSDB is to release Rs. 225 million to the Irrigation Department for the renovation of the Kudawilachchiya tank. Steps are being initiated to undertake environment and archaeological impact studies on the Kudawilachchiya tank project.
It has also been proposed to obtain water supply for the proposed Eppawala-Rajangane-Nochchiyagama-Giribawa integrated mega drinking water scheme and for the Thambuttegama water project from the 85000 a.f. capacity Rajangane reservoir. It has been estimated that the total daily water requirement for running the two water projects would be 69,300 cubic metres of water. The Rajangane reservoir would provide 25,300 cubic metres. The President’s Secretary has instructed stakeholder parties to ensure that the agriculture water supply from the Rajangane tank wouldn’t be affected at all as a result of the drinking water ptoject.
In this connection, the Irrigation Ministry has already initiated action to hold a systematic water balance study in the Kalaoya river basin, which feeds the Rajangane reservoir.
The Chinese government has provided a loan package worth Rs. 19,000 million to realize the Thambuttegama water scheme, while the Israeli and Swiss governments are funding the Eppawala-Rajangane-Nochchiyagama-Giribawa integrated water project.
In the meantime, the Mahaweli Authority has agreed to release the required quantum of water to Habarana tank from Mahaweli water system to start the proposed Palugaswewa drinking water supply project. Apart from this, two mega water projects using the Wahalkada and Mahakanadarawa reservoirs as main water sources are under construction.
It has been decided to supply additional water to these two tanks under the Moragahakanda and Yanoya reservoir projects, catering to nearly 200,000 people in Madawachchiya, Rambewa, Padaviya, Kahatagasdigiliya, Mihinthale and Horowpothana areas.
The Irrigation Department has been instructed to ascertain the possibility of providing additional water to the Huruluwewa tank through the Upper Elahera canal system to realize the Galenbidunuwewa water project.
A problem has arisen in finding a suitable water source to feed the Galgamuwa water project. A survey is underway to obtain water from the Siyambalagaskotuwa tank to feed the proposed Puttalam Town (south) water project.
