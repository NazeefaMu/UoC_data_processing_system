Reaching Out to the Needy

Surviving without a family is the most difficult thing for a child. Comprehending this SOS Children’s Villages are taking all efforts to pour out the love and affection on these little children. They want to take the message of love out to the public as well. They have been doing a lot of work to make sure the children of this country are supported. For this, they need the public to join hands with them. They are determined that the quality of care continues.
When you think of these children some have lost both their parents, some come from broken families, the single parent is deemed unfit to raise the child or the family is poverty stricken.
Daily News went to SOS Children’s Village Galle which was started in 1990 and celebrates 37 year of Service by SOS Villages in Sri Lanka.
At the village the first thing we all saw was the exhibits of the art exhibition and competition, where the schools around Galle on invitation of SOS, joined hands with the SOS Children.
Another feature of the village was the stall that belonged to the family strengthening program. Here they have identified the below poverty line families around the areas. The Children are supported for five years in the education. Their books, uniforms and meals are all provided. The parents are helped to develop skills so that they can earn money. These stalls are by the families supported by SOS Children’s Villages. These items are produced by the mothers, so that they may sell and make an income for their children.
“Hermann Gmeiner is the Global Founder of SOS children’s Villages. This was a concept he initiated in 1949 after World War II. He understood the suffering faced by the children who had lost their parents. So he devised a new method to look after them. He himself was an orphan and had 10 siblings looked after by his older sister. So he thought of a system where a lady could play the part of a mother to a group of children. In this village in Galle we have 12 families with 120 children. Each mother looks after 10 children. They have lost their parental care for various reasons such as separation of the family, poverty or death of both parents. Some of them have one parent – father or mother. They are directed to us by the courts or probation department,” said Director National Youth Care Programs Kapila Gunawardhana.
There are two programs – Short Term Care and Long Term Care. They provide long term care for children who have lost their parents. When it comes to Short Term Care, they provide care for a short time, maximum three years.
“These children need care for a short time. After that we reintegrate with the parent, who maybe facing a court case or who has gone abroad. When they return from abroad the family gets together. So until the parent comes back, the child needs some short term care. At our village the mothers are well trained to look after the children, having undergone a thorough training. They are educated in child psychology, cooking and sewing. In other words everything a mother needs to know. When a mother retires the ‘aunt’ will step into her shoes and with her experience and maturity become a mother of a house,” said Gunawardhana.
SOS Children’s Villages National Director Divakar Ratnaduraipointed out that more than giving a child a house to live in, what they need is a loving home with a maternal figure.
“SOS Children’s Villages are flourishing in 135 countries throughout the world. This is a reason for great joy. In Sri Lanka we have villages in Piliyandala, Nuwaraeliya, Galle, Anuradhapura, Moneragala and Jaffna. The villages are supporting children who have lost parental care. We also support the children who are at the risk of losing parental care. So in these two programs there are a very large number of children. In these 37 years we have managed to support 15,000 children. They live happily with their siblings and natural brothers and sisters. They belong to a community and they always have someone. They are supported until they are really settled in life,” said Ratnadurai
Brand Ambassador for SOS Children’s Villages Roshan Mahanama, had absolutely no hesitation when he was asked to join the cause.
“When I was invited to be a part of SOS Children’s Villages I had no hesitation. I have grown up in a culture where I was exposed to Social Welfare. I firmly believe that you need to spare a thought for the less fortunate. I am so happy that I have received this opportunity to do something for these children and children as a whole,” said Mahanama.
Mahanama stressed on the fact that children are our future and that we as a society need to do the utmost for them.
“We need to see that they have an education and that they are living a full and happy childhood. We need to do everything possible to provide them with love and care. I am actively involved in a foundation where we have built 47 pre-schools, and are in the process of building a center of excellence for kids with disability,” stated Mahanama.
Mahanama believes in a social conscience. He feels that what we must do is not for profit but we must do the right thing in life.
“I feel that I have a responsibility towards society, especially where kids are concerned. I feel I have so much to do because I know I have the capacity. I know my duties and responsibilities. I also feel that we need leadership at the political level. We need to be change makers. And I say this because it is something that comes from my heart. Our politicians should not be preoccupied with winning elections. They need to want to genuinely do something for our society and our children. I feel we need to get together, rally around and convince our leaders to take up this cause. We can all contribute in our own way,” said Mahanama.
