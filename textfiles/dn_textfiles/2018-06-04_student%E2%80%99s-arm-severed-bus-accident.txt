Student’s arm severed in bus accident

A team of surgeons at the Colombo National Hospital were engaged in a lengthy surgery yesterday to re-attach the hand of a 23-year-old university student whose arm was severed during an accident.
Doctors later confirmed that the operation was unsuccessful and the patient required an amputation.The student who was travelling in a passenger bus had stuck his arm out of the bus and his hand was cut off when a tipper truck coming from the opposite direction crashed onto the bus .
The hand had severed from the elbow and surgeons said the bone was too crushed for the hand to be re-attached.The accident had happened at Kiriwaldeniya junction in Pelmadulla.
The undergraduate at the Sabaragamuwa campus had boarded a bus travelling towards Bibile and he had kept his right hand outside the bus when the tipper collided.
The student was rushed to the Ratnapura hospital and was transferred to the National hospital yesterday afternoon. He was identified as a 23 year old resident of Kithulgoda and the Tipper driver was arrested by the police. Pelmadulla police are conducting further investigations
