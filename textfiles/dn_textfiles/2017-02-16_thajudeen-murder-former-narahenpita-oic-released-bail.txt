Thajudeen Murder: Former Narahenpita OIC released on bail

 
Former Crimes OIC of Narahenpita Police Sumith Perera was released on bail by Colombo High Court Judge Manilal Vaidyathilaka, today (16).
The Former OIC was imposed a cash bail of Rs. 100,000, three surety bails of Rs. 1 million and a travel ban.
He was also ordered to be present before the Crimes Investigation Department (CID) ones a month.
The former Crimes OIC was held in connection with the Wasim Thajudeen murder, and was accused of concealing information relating to the case.
Thajudeen died on May 17, 2012 in what was initially purported to be a car crash.
Evidence later emerged to support the theory that the former Havelocks SC skipper and national rugby player was murdered.
