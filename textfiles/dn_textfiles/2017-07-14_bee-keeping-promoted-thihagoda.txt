Bee-keeping promoted in Thihagoda

The Science, Technology and Research Ministry has taken the initiative to promote bee keeping in the Divisional Secretariat Division of Thihagoda.
According to the Science, Technology and Research Officer attached to Thihagoda Vidhata Resource centre Chandrani Amarawickrama, bee keeping development programmes have already been initiated at Grama Niladari division level in the Thihagoda Divisional Secretariat area.The projects carried out in the Akkarapanaha Grama Niladari division have made significant progress at the moment. Most low income families are successfully engaging in the project, officials stated.
As an incentive to those engaged in these ventures, physical resources such as bee boxes would be provided free of charge. In addition, measures have been taken to provide them with training, instructions and technical know-how with regard to bee keeping promotional activities.
Considering the progress beneficiaries make, bee keeping will be expanded to the rest of the Grama Niladari areas in the Thihagoda Divisional Secretariat Division.
More low-income families are expected to engage in these activities as an avenue of self-employment Amarawickrama said.
Economic empowerment of low income families through the promotion of bee keeping colonies in the area would be the aim of these endeavours, the project officer added.
