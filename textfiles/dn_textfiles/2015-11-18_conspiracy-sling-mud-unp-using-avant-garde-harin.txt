Conspiracy to sling mud at UNP using Avant Garde - Harin

There is a conspiracy to sling mud at the UNP using the Avant Garde issue, Telecommunication and Digital Infrastructure Minister Harin Fernando said.
He said the UNP never wants to close the chapter on Avant Garde or defend it. "This is why the Prime Minister is seeking a full scale inquiry on the Avant Garde issue," Fernando said.
The minister was addressing the media yesterday at the Telecommunication and Digital Infrastructure Ministry. He said that certain politicians are making baseless allegations about several politicians including him that they have received gains from Avant Garde and added that he will never betray the UNP for monetary gain.
Minister Fernando challenged anyone for a debate on the concept of floating armouries of the world as it is not something new to maritime security.
Speaking on the resignation of Former Law and Order Minister Tilak Marapana, Minister Fernando said that he (Marapana) is an exemplary figures in Sri Lankan politics.
He further said that it is clear that certain persons are slinging mud at the UNP over the Avant Garde issue.
"Avant Garde was formed during the former government. Even though, the politicians did not utter a single word against Avant Guard when the agreement was signed during the last regime, they are now making a big noise against Avant Garde," he said.
He noted that there are over 6,500 employees at Avant Garde and therefore their job security should be assured.
"What I am asking is to convert Avant Garde as an income generating venture for the country while securing these 6,500 employments," he said.
