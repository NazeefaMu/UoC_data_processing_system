Central Authority for solid waste management

 
President Maithripala Sirisena at a progress review meeting this morning ordered a speedy solution to solid waste management. 
The President furthered ordered necessary arrangements are made to vest power with a Central Authority in regard to this.
The garbage issue has reached a peak with over 700 MT of garbage collected daily and no place to dump it.
Having identified several other temporary locations, the government was met with stiff resistance from residents who protested the dumping of garbage in their areas.
