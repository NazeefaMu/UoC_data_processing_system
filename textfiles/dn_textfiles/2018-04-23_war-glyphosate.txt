War on glyphosate

The trouble l have against scribes who use the prefix Dr. is that they do not disclose, for what and from where, they have obtained their doctorate. It can be a doctorate in theology from some small College for the blind or a doctorate in demonology from a small College for dropouts. But the prefix even though worthless, is often used to bamboozle, beguile, mislead and betray and at times as a mask to hide behind by a card carrying member of a political party to spread its poison or a sleeper in a cell of spies to spread confusion.
Recently there was an article by a scribe using the prefix Dr. claiming that glyphosate is linked with kidney disease among farmers in the dry zone. No evidence was furnished. Only a bald statement. The white coats who have nothing to do these days except walk the streets shouting slogans and drag their once admired Association into the gutter, also joined the war against glyphosate.
Agricultural crops
Those against glyphosate are duty bound to suggest an alternative. Otherwise the country will suffer the fate the ancients suffered with frequent famines. Just for the argument what is the fertilizer other countries use where agricultural crops are a major export? Do they use glyphosate or some other fertilizer? How many citizens - where glyphosate is used - are suffering from kidney disease? If dug deep you will discover more citizens die of traffic accidents than kidney disease.
Harmful to health
Glyphosate by volume is one of the most widely used fertilizer in the US agricultural sector. Its valency formula which I have in front of me boggles the mind each bar of the diagram representing a pair of electrons with spins opposite doing a covalent bond dance. I learnt my Chemistry at the feet of Prof. T. Kandiah who often warned his students that he is only laying the foundation and it is for us to build upon it. His qualifications will easily scroll out of this page but never flaunted his numerous Doctorates. He died at an early age and until his death he simply described himself as Dean, Faculty of Science, University of Ceylon.
The fertilizer was discovered by Monsanto chemist John Franz, a true genius, who like a Grandmaster moving the pieces in a chess board moved the radicals and atoms to discover a formula to checkmate the pests and deliver an abundance, the way the hydrogen atom was moved in butter to produce margarine at an affordable price which some nutritionists believe is harmful to health, because it is something unnatural. It is relevant here to add that the patent Mosantano had in the US, which brought the product to the market under the trade name Roundup, expired in 2000.With that countries that do not care a damn for human health have jumped in to produce cheap formulations of glyphosate which are not within the US standard.
It is wise not to rely on competitive bidding but pay an extra dime and procure glyphosate from the US under the trade name Roundup, than go for a product from third world copycats who are devils incarnate who care tuppence for standards. The devil you know is better than the devil you don't, to save not only our bodies but also our souls.
After the No-Confidence Motion was defeated, Mahinda Rajapaksa, a man for all seasons, who knows which fertilizer to use on which toady, described the defeat as a victory. Then how do you describe a victory? Scholastics, the medieval philosophers will argue that Mahinda Rajapaksa not only lost a futile challenge, even the beatific vision.
