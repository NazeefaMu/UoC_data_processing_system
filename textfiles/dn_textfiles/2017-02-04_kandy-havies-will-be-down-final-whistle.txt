Kandy-Havies will be down to the final whistle

It is a crucial match for table leaders and defending champions Kandy SC and title chasing Havelock SC as they go into the Dialog ‘A’ division league game having prepared and in peak form and with a better mind-set at Havelock Park under lights tomorrow. Both clubs know it is a big game, but they will need to keep calm heads and the approach right. These two clubs are placed first and second in the table, level on points and the winner will pocket the league title. When the sides met earlier this season at Nittawela, Kandy SC won.
The Park clubs under the guidance of a Kandy product Ronnie Ibrahim are in the best position that the club has ever been in. He has the knack of producing champions and it will be no different this time round. Havelock SC currently are in top form, having lost only once this season. Even the best of teams are known to have off-days.
It is just how you respond that will finally matter. Kandy S.C. coach Sean Wijesinghe says he is going into this game well prepared and with a better mind-set. “We know it is a big game, but we need calm heads and the approach must be right. We have to adapt to the weather and understand that they have been on the back of a thumping and so they are going to want to put things right as well.’ Kandy's hopes will be boosted with the return of their skipper Roshan Weeraratne who had to skip two games and Nigel Ratwatte who has been out since the start suffering a nasty leg injury.

Lack of grounds hits schools sports
Sports is compulsory at schools, sad to say most of the cricket and rugby playing schools lack grounds for matches and are finding it difficult to play their matches. In the early days a hand full of schools were involved in sports and they had no problem today every school is into cricket and rugby. The cost of ground maintenance is high and they have to charge a fee. What the Sports Ministry should do is upgrade the Bogambara Stadium for rugby and come up with a cricket ground for school matches. The ground fees charged for both sports are at five star level and some schools can't afford it.
