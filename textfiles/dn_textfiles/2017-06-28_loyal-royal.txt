Loyal to  Royal

Admirable mental faculties honed by decision-making under adversity are Head Prefect of Royal College Dinuka de Zoysa’s hallmark. Perfect Prefect features Dinuka de Zoysa, a man who is no stranger to multi-tasking, who is motivated by putting Royal before himself.
“Actually it is all about balancing everyone at a school. A college is a place where people from different backgrounds meet. My duty as a prefect, along with the other prefects, is to treat everyone equally and lead them all to achieve the common goals of Royal College. It is about basically balancing studies, sports and club activities and reaching and achieving targets. The main role as a prefect of Royal College is to basically uphold and uplift the discipline. That is why the prefect system all began. To maintain discipline. Discipline is the first concern at Royal College. And upholding that is my primary duty,” said de Zoysa
De Zoysa believes you also need to prioritise everything you do.
“At Royal College, there is a lot of stuff you need to balance. You manage sports while you manage academics as well. When you are in a sport you focus on that, and when you are studying you focus fully on studies without letting your mind get distracted.
The most important thing is correct decision making - Considering all aspects and taking everyone’s view into consideration. Putting them on one page, and being very open to everyone’s ideas and taking the best decision possible for the school regardless of your personal agendas,” explained de Zoysa.
For de Zoysa the sky is the limit having received three As and excelling in other activities at Royal.
I am right after my A-Ls, which I did in August last year. After that, we get appointed as probationary prefects in September. Then from September to December, we have a short probationary period and in January we are appointed as senior prefects. In February there is a vote within the Council, from which the top 10 are chosen. I was appointed Prefect in September, 2016. My tenure will finish in December, 2017. But I was appointed Head Prefect in February this year.
I have been currently selected to the Sri Jayawardenepura University for Management. I am debating whether I should go abroad for my higher studies or stay here. I want to do a double degree in Economics and Marketing. A double degree is not possible in Sri Lanka in local universities. So that is the dilemma I am facing. I need to take a decision soon,” pointed out de Zoysa.
De Zoysa also explained the prefect structure at Royal.
“There is the Prefect’s council and we are known as the Prefects’ Council of 2016/2017. There is a vote within the Council, for the top 10, and after that, there is an interview with the Principal, the top administration and the Royal College Union Secretary. Collectively they make the decision. The decision is the discretion of the prefects, principal and the management. Basically, the council votes on their top 10 preferences for Head Prefect.
After myself, there are six other deputies. Overall there are 86 prefects including me. The Deputy Head Prefects are divided into academics, sports, 5S, IT and Clubs and Societies. The 5S is a world-renowned system. It is a workplace organisation method teaching values such as cleanliness, sustainability, keeping the right thing at the right place etc.
Then there is a senior deputy head prefect who is in charge of the finances and is the treasurer of the council and generally supports me. I generally oversee everything,” elucidated de Zoysa.

At Royal, there are annual projects – around 150 in number.
“Right now we are planning on putting up solar panels in the main building to bring the cost of the maintenance down to zero. And Royal College is the only school that contributes to the national grid in terms of electricity. Last Saturday we went to Deniyaya with the Prime Minister to donate items for the flood victims. We do a lot of projects during a year - major and small projects,” added de Zoysa
As a Head Prefect along with the other prefects, the duty is to highlight the important fundamental principles of Royal.
“Regardless of change, the fundamental principles, the spirit of a Royalist and how you behave in society and how you be a gentleman, such qualities I need to inculcate in the boys. That is my primary duty, as well as organising projects,” stated de Zoysa.
The obligations of a prefect at Royal are many.

“We have something called the clubs and Prefects’ Felicitation Ceremony. There are 50 clubs and societies in Royal College and all of them do a fantastic job throughout the year. And at the end of the year, they are graded according to their performance. That is a huge ceremony which is done in December. In March we organise Colours Night and felicitate the sportsmen. Those are the responsibilities of the clubs and Sports Deputy Head Prefects,” informed de Zoysa.
At Royal, the College traditions are important. And prefects know the traditions. They support the administration. The prefect system at Royal College is very structured and it has been developed over a long time.
“We innovate every year but the project idea is the same. As soon as the hostellers come – the scholarship holders to the grade 6 - we show them around school and Colombo, since they come from rural areas.
Then there is motivation for sports teams before their encounters. Then there is supporting underprivileged students,” said de Zoysa
De Zoysa feels that pressure brings out the best in them.
“There is a quote that we at Royal College all look up to: Adversity causes some men to break and some men to break records. That is something we at Royal College all follow. At Royal, there is a lot of pressure with a huge amount of stakeholders: 8500 students and teachers and a countless number of Old Boys. There are so many ideas coming around from everyone. It is a government school and we have to follow government regulations as well.
But we, as prefects, actually flourish under pressure. Being under pressure brings the best out of us. We feel that if we are under pressure we can perform better. We tend to cope well with pressure,” shared de Zoysa
In Royal, you learn to adapt to everyone.
“You need to find your motivation to combat stress. Our motivation is seeing Royal excel. There are 86 people in my council including myself. All 86 are not the same and you can’t expect them to be the same. You tend to adapt to each person! You need to get the best out of everyone. At Royal, we are always taught to be loyal to Royal. We want to serve Royal for everything it has given us,” elucidated de Zoysa.
De Zoysa has proud words for anyone who wants to take a leadership position at Royal
“To be a leader you need to focus on what is important at that time, prioritise. Educational qualifications are number one at Royal. You need to learn well. You need to learn the soft skills. That is why we do sports and clubs and societies. You learn to balance things. Do everything for Royal and not for personal gain. If you do that, you will be rewarded.
If I am someone today it is definitely because of my Prefects Council. They have helped me lead the school. They are behind me as always. My family has made me become what I am today. They have supported me throughout and they have been extremely patient understanding of my obligations,” summed up de Zoysa.
