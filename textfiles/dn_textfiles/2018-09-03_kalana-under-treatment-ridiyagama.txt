Kalana under treatment at Ridiyagama

Kalana - the elephant of the Vishnu Devale in Devinuwara injured due to alleged neglect by its owners, was taken to the Ridiyagama Safari Garden under the Department of National Zoological Gardens yesterday for treatment.
Two persons were arrested for neglecting the elephant and they were released on a Rs. 100,000 surety bail each when they were produced before the Matara Magistrate.
Kalana’s mahout and the Secretary to the Devinuwara Vishnu Devalaya Basnayake Nilame were arrested last Tuesday in this regard.
Kalana was allegedly chained at the same place in the Devinuwara Vishnu Devalaya for about three years. Its legs had been injured and infected.
The arrests were made following a Police complaint lodged by Wildlife Deputy Minister Palitha Thewarapperuma and the Wildlife Department officials on Monday. The Deputy Minister intervened after environmentalists and social media activists told him the issue.
Veterinarians of the National Zoological Gardens Department are treating the elephant. They inspected the elephant on Saturday. The elephant was gifted to the Devalaya in 1989 by former President, the late Ranasinghe Premadasa.
