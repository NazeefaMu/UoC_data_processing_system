Chandimal has mark of a great batsman – coach Pothas

ABU DHABI, Friday – Sri Lanka coach Nic Pothas praised the innings of skipper Dinesh Chandimal and said that he had the marks of a great batsman.
“Chandi is a leader. He expects high standards from the team whether it is preparation or fielding or fitness. He sets some great example. I am very happy for him,” said Pothas at the end of the second day.
“We have worked a few things on his batting and he is very happy that those things have come good. That was a great Test match innings.
“If you look at the last two knocks, against Australia in 2016 and against Bangladesh in 2017, those were quite similar. He is a free flowing batsman and the mark of a great batsman to adapt and he has certainly done that,” he said.
Pothas was pleased by the application shown by the Lankan batsmen by batting for more than 150 overs and extending their first innings to the fifth session of the first Test before being dismissed for 419.
“It’s very pleasing to bat more than 150 overs as a team and that length of time. It’s no secret that the wicket and outfield are slow. You can add another 50 or 60 runs to the total,” said Pothas.
“Very pleasing with the application shown by the boys, this is Test cricket and things don’t happen at pace. Credit to the Pakistani bowlers they have been out there for a long time and they bowled well and fielded well.”
“You have to give credit to some of the unsung heroes. Kaushal Silva he scored only 12 but he was there for more than 70 minutes.
He took the spells off the opening bowlers and that takes the pressure off the middle order batters.
“All those lower scores are there, but the impressive thing is that when people get in, they convert them into big scores. That is the mark of good batters.”
