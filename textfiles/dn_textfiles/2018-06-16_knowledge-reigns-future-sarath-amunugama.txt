Knowledge reigns in future: Sarath Amunugama

Science, Technology, Research, Skills Development & Vocational Training and Kandyan Heritage, Minister addressing an assembly of students and teachers at the Green University recently said knowledge will be the most valuable asset in future.
The meeting was at the auditorium of the Green University, during an observation tour of the university by the Minister. Vice Chancellor Dr. E.A.Weerasinghe, NSBM Chairman P. Ranepura, Ministry Secretary Sandhya Wijebandara, Prof. Bharatha Dodankotuwa and others accompanied the Minister.
“I never expected to hear today something I wrote when I was a university student. I thank you for giving me that opportunity. Though I have held many positions during my career, what gives me most satisfaction is my association with universities. The times I spent studying at Peradeniya University, Harvard and Sorbonne were tremendous experiences. I must say that today when I came to the Green University.l I got the same feeling.
He said the country’s greatest asset is its children. "After Independence, every government has tried to secure a good future for them. Sitting before us today is a most important group of those children. The people have made great sacrifices to bring you to this level," the Minister said.
"Free education, health services, and social insurance in Sri Lanka are not found in many other countries. When we look at the higher education scene in this country today, what we observe is that many bright children face an examination of a few hours and a part of them get into state universities while another part of equal ability get left behind. Our challenge is how to secure the future of this group. This university is an answer to such a challenge," the Minister said.
He said the people believe that the State must do everything. "When we were university students, we talked about minerals, the vegetation, the infrastructure and others. as the resources of a country.
"Today knowledge is considered the greatest resource. Therefore, knowledge will be the most important asset of the future. We rank high among the countries that have achieved the Millennium Goals,” the Minister said.
