SLC elections to go ahead as scheduled

In a special media announcement the Election Committee of Sri Lanka Cricket has denied the reports appearing in several media reports that have stated that calling for nominations for the election of office bearers of Sri Lanka Cricket has been indefinitely postponed.
The committee wishes to reiterate there is no legal provision whatsoever to cancel or postpone the election of office bearers of SLC as the process was given effect by an Extraordinary Gazette Notification 2089/56 dated 22 September 2018.
Accordingly the committee will proceed as per the notice served upon the membership and on dates stipulated thereof states an SLC media release signed by the three members Justice PWDC Jayathilake, IM Abeyrathna and Sunil Sirisena. Elections are scheduled for February 7.
