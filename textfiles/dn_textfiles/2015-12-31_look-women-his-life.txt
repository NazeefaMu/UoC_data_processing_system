A look at the women in his life

At 50, Salman Khan continues to remain the most sought after irresistibly charming bachelor of Bollywood. The actor has had his share of affairs but he has always been careful not to wash the linen of his affairs in public. But the actor has never shied away from flaunting his glamorous girl pals at social dos and other events. We take a look at the women who have been a part of in Salman's love life.
Sangeeta Bijlani: Sangeeta was a Miss India who started trying her luck in films. Salman fell for this beauty queen and sister Alvira apparently played cupid. If there is one woman who Salman came too close to marrying, it was Sangeeta Bijlani. Rumour has it that wedding cards were also almost printed. But unfortunately, the love story ended. Both, however, continue to remain the best of friends.
Somy Ali: A 19 year old Somy Ali was the next one to walk into Salman's heart. The two made for a happy couple but this one turned out to be a brief relationship. Rumour has it that Salman's drinking ways played spoilsport and the couple called it quits.
Aishwarya Rai: Salman Khan fell hook, line and sinker for the light eyed former Miss World Aishwarya Rai and the duo whipped up some legendary chemistry in Hum Dil De Chuke Sanam. Salman was reportedly madly in love with Aishwarya who too reciprocated with equal warmth initially. However, problems cropped up with Salman's alleged abusive behaviour towards Aishwarya being seen as the prime reason behind the couple going their separate ways.
Katrina Kaif: This one went on for a long while. Salman was apparently besotted by this London beauty who had just made her debut in Bollywood with a disaster called Boom. Salman took Katrina under his wings and love blossomed between the duo and so did the latter's career in Bollywood. Katrina was quite faithful having stood behind Salman through his turbulent times especially when he was incarcerated. However like every other Salman love stories this one too came to an end. Apart from the above four women, Salman has also been linked to a lot many other actresses.
Sneha Ullal: Salman launched an Aishwarya Rai look alike, Sneha Ullal in Lucky and the duo were linked up very soon. However the sizzle died down after the movie flopped at the box-office.
Zareen Khan: Yet another newcomer who was launched by Salman. Link up rumours started doing the rounds after Zareen was spotted with Salman at various social dos.
However all such news became history soon.
Daisy Shah: The umpteenth newcomer who Salman launched. Gossip mills were soon churning with news of the two seeing eqch other. As always, they turned out to be nothing but rumours. Daisy is seen hanging out with Salman these days.
Claudia Ciesla: Claudia's only claim to fame has been her brief association with Salman Khan. Like others, Claudia too accompanied Salman to many events and it didn't take long for gossip mills to get out news churning of their affair. Nothing great emerged out of the association.
Iulia Vantur: Salman's fixation for foreign beauties continues and this time it is Romanian beauty who seems to have captured his heart. Iulia is Salman's current constant companion leading to speculations of the superstar's plan to settle down with her. Only time will tell if this romance is for the keeps.
