Ranil remains Champion:
Unaffected, unchallenged, and confident

The no-faith motion, which proved to be nothing but a damp squib despite the media feeding frenzies for two full weeks, has however opened up the political space to bring in the much needed structural and policy reforms to the Government, giving it yet another chance to stay the course.
The need to grasp this opportunity from both the hands were expressed by many a members in the United National Front for Good Governance during the debate of No-Confidence Motion (NCM) against the Prime Minister.
The 12-hour marathon debate was well-attended by the members of both sides, unlike the many present-day Parliamentary debates, where the member on his feet speaks mostly to empty chairs. Yet it failed to bring the excitement it promised because the political developments in the eve of the motion and the morning next day made it certain that the Premier has got no real challenge.
UNF closed ranks
The Government, to be more specific the UNF camp, was able to turn the tables on the sponsors of the motion and prove it to be a flop right from the start. The NCM presented by the Joint Opposition backfired on them as it made public the fissures in his own group, whereas Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe turned it around as a Confidence Motion for him and his Government to emerge stronger.
The biggest achievement for the UNP was that it could face the NCM as one bloc despite the heightened intra-party issues following the unexpected set back at the Local Government polls two months ago. The JO could not even rope in the support of UNP dissident MP and former Justice Minister Dr. Wijayedasa Rajapakshe, who broke ranks with the Government in August last year.
UNP MPs Palitha Range Bandara and Wasantha Senanayake, who were openly critical of the party leadership, also tamely toed the party line and rendered their support to defeat the NCM.
Taking the wind out of JO's sails, the duo went public with their decision at a press conference convened on the day of the debate.
The minority parties allied with the UNF including the Sri Lanka Muslim Congress (SLMC) led by Minister Rauf Hakeem, All Ceylon Makkal Congress (ACMC) led by Minister Rishad Bathiudeen, and Tamil Progressive Alliance (TPA) led by Mano Ganesan collectively threw their weight behind the Prime Minister. It must be noted that the vote of those minority parties along with the 16 votes of the Tamil National Alliance (TNA) led by R Sampanthan played a key role in deciding which side would get the simple majority of 113 votes.
“You can't have your cake and eat it”
To say it in plain, it was the SLFP which suffered the biggest blow from the NCM. The SLFP group in the Government was split down the middle with one faction supporting the no-faith motion and the other faction choosing to be absent for the vote. The SLFP members in the Government ranks were unable to take a collective decision on the vote of NCM even after having a series of meetings, some even chaired by their party leader President Maithripala Sirisena. With the SLFP MPs in the Joint Opposition, the SLFP has now splintered into three factions, driving the party into further crisis.
The UNP members, especially the backbenchers, who have been weary of the uneasy political marriage with the SLFP, were quick to demand the purge of all SLFP ministers and deputy ministers who voted in favour. UNP State Minister Dr. Harsha de Silva, taking the floor after Minister Dayasiri Jayasekara, said in no certain terms that the SLFP MPs, who choose to vote against the Government and the Prime Minister, should immediately leave the Government.
“Voting in favour of this motion means that you are against the Government of which you are also a part of. It is highly unethical for you to continue to stay in the Government after doing so. If you are a minister with a backbone, the right thing to do is to cross over to the Opposition benches. You cannot have the cake and eat it too,” he told Minister Jayasekara.
“JO lukewarm about NCM”
JVP MP Bimal Rathnayake, joining in the debate, stated that the biggest betrayal of the people’s mandate was from President Sirisena. He directly said that the President was behind the NCM against the PM and that it was presented with the support of a few JO MPs in “Gota Kalliya”.
He accused the Joint Opposition of not showing real interest in succeeding the NCM. Pointing at the poor attendance of JO, which was less than 20 in number at the time of moving the motion, MP Rathnayake went on to say that the JO’s interest in defeating the NCM was even lesser than their interest in securing the ruling power of a local council. He charged that this lacklustre attitude was due to “political deals” between Premier Wickremesinghe and former President Rajapaksa.
JO firebrand Dinesh Gunawardena too did not have his shrill voice when presenting the motion on behalf of his group. He however largely criticized the Government for not taking prompt action against the Central Bank bond issues and for letting former Central Bank Governor Arjuna Mahendran to leave the country. Prime Minister Wickremesinghe made a brief appearance in the chamber as the motion against him was being moved.
Minister Susil Premajayantha, stole the limelight of the debate, with a tirade against Government for about half an hour. He received cheers of the Joint Opposition MPs and jeers of the UNP backbenchers as he spoke. He was critical of the President’s act of removing him from the post of General Secretary of the UPFA with few days to go for the Parliamentary Elections in 2015.
He went on to say that the day the SLFP old hands such as Nimal Siripala de Silva, John Seneviratne, Anura Yapa, Dilan Perera and himself pull out of the SLFP, there would not be a National Government. He took pains to say that he has no “craving for positions” and has no ill-gotten money or property. As Premajayantha vented his anger and frustration in a broadside at the Government, many expected an imminent cross over following his speech. However, this did not happen even after the vote where 16 of SLFP ministers and deputy ministers including Premajayantha voted in favour of the motion.
NCM done and dusted
The debate reached its climax as Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne, a frontline member of the UNF and one of the first few to defect the Rajapaksa administration to rally around the cause of good governance, made the winding up speech on behalf of the Government. The minister, who brought in a bundle of FCID and CID files and the 34 PRECIFAC reports, fired salvos at the JO by detailing on a number of high profile cases and myriad of charges against JO MPs and close associates and family members of former President Rajapaksa. He vowed that these cases would be expedited in the coming days and that the culprits would be prosecuted before long.
The public gallery was filled to capacity and the Government and Opposition benches were mostly filled as Premier Wickremesinghe walked into the main chamber at 9 pm, half an hour ahead of the Vote of No-Confidence.
Concluding a marathon debate, Speaker Karu Jayasuriya announced the final results at 10 pm after taking the vote by name. The House negatived the NCM with a majority of 46 votes, thus reinforcing the confidence on the PM. The NCM was done and dusted with 122 votes against and 76 votes in favour ending 14 days of number game in Parliament.
Former President Rajapaksa turned up for the vote finally as the quorum bell went off and voted for the motion along with his brother Chamal and son Namal. He left the chamber before the final results were announced.
Having won the vote, jubilant PM thanked his group at a committee room in Parliament, and then the celebrations began for the Grand Old Party with some colourful firework near the Parliament complex.
Two signatories to NCM among absentees
The SLFP members, who voted in favour of the motion, included Parliamentarians Susil Premajayantha, Dayasiri Jayasekara, Dilan Perera, John Seneviratne, Lakshman Wasantha Perera, Dr. Sudarshani Fernandopulle, Tharanath Basnayake, Susantha Punchinilame, Anura Yapa, S. B. Dissanayake, Lakshman Yapa Abeywardena, Chandima Weerakkody, Anuradha Jayaratne, Sumedha Jayasena, T. B. Ekanayake and Deputy Speaker Thilanga Sumathipala.
Minister Nimal Siripala de Silva did not turn up during the vote but the SLFP group who supported the motion said he was also on the same page with them. The JVP voted in favour keeping to its word, while the TNA en bloc voted against.
A total of 26 MPs were absent. Among them were 23 SLFP members including UPFA General Secretary Mahinda Amaraweera and SLFP General Secretary Duminda Dissanayake. Ven. Athuraliye Rathana thera was also absent. Notably, two SLFP MPs who signed the motion, Kader Masthan and Nishantha Muthuhettigama, were also not present.
This was the 47th NCM in the Sri Lankan Parliament history and the third against a Prime Minister. Previously, two NCMs had been submitted and taken for vote against former PMs late SWRD Bandaranaike in 1957 and late Sirimavo Bandaranaike in 1975. Those two motions had also been defeated with a comfortable margin.
