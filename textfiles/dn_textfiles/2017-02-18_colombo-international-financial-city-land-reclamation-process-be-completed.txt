Colombo International Financial City land reclamation process to be completed by 2018

The Colombo International Financial City land reclamation process will be completed by 2018 and opportunities will be provided for investment and construction before 2019, Megapolis and Western development Minister Patali Champika Ranawaka said.
The minister stated this while participating as the Chief Guest in “Lanka Property Show 2017” at JAIC Hilton, Colombo yesterday.
“The industrial townships in Meerigama and Horana have already commenced. We have identified lands that will be made available for industrial use. There are opportunities for developers to invest in environment friendly and locally sound industries,”he said.
The minister added that the Homagama and Malabe areas have been identified as techno city that will provide the space and infrastructure required for innovation based industries. “I welcome investors to look into invention based opportunities.If we want to develop as a competitive nation in the future,an innovative based economy is the best way forward for Sri Lanka,”he said.
The minister further said that they have not forgotten the marginalised group,the low and middle income earners of urban society.
“While allowing development for those who look for luxury,we have already commenced housing programmes for the needy. More than 5,000 housing units for middle income earners and another 15 000 housing units for low income earners have been planned. We have done everything in a very democratic and transparent manner although there is criticism,”he said.
Minister Ranawaka also pointed out that unless the relevant authorities attend to a few burning issues in the urban areas none of these development projects will be fruitful.
“The urban areas have many issues related to drainage, sewerage disposal and solid waste; those should have been addressed long time back. We have already implemented a project for flood control and a national water management center also will be established,” he said.
The minister added that the transportation and mobility issues that we have in this region needs to be sorted out immediately.
“In order to uplift the quality of life of the people in Colombo and its surroundings, it is not merely a matter of providing a few more houses and employment opportunities, but providing opportunities and exposure to improve the people’s social, cultural and spiritual well-being,”he said.
