CDB iNet breaks mould  in fund transfers

Citizen’s Development Business Finance CDB’s revolutionary e-finance platform CDBiNet is using the contemporary role that Facebook plays in people’s current lifestyles to initiate fund transfers.
CDBiNet, the first of its kind e-finance platform in Sri Lanka, very simply allows any CDBiNet user who has a CDB Savings Account to transfer funds to Facebook friends via Facebook itself and does not need to know any bank account details of the recipient. This fund transfer via Facebook is yet another first for Sri Lanka and further emphasizes CDB’s pioneering innovations in using technology as a fundamental advantage for its constantly expanding product and service portfolio. With CDB savings account holders now eligible for this facility, customers gain added convenience for their financial operations.
Fund transfers via Facebook can be at present from a desktop/laptop and the recipient (FB Friend) can receive the funds via any mobile device or laptop/desktop that have access to a Facebook account.
“The biggest advantage of the FB transfer is that the receiver does not share individual bank details with the sender, which ensures absolute security and confidentiality of personal details,” explains CDB’s General Manager – Emergent Business Information Technology Imdaad Naguib.
The benefits and advantages pertinent to this revolutionising innovation are many.
From sending gifts to helping a friend in need or making a donation to a worthy cause, this transfer option is truly a boon to those who don’t want to embarrass the beneficiary by requesting their bank account details.
As Chief Digital Officer and Head Digital Face of Intellect Design Arena Rajesh Kuppuswamy, said, “The entire concept of money transfers has been revolutionised and reduced to just three steps of logging into the account, choosing the recipient on FB and transferring the funds.”
