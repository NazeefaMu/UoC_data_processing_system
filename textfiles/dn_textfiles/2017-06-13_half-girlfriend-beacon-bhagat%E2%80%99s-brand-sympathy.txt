Half Girlfriend: Beacon on Bhagat’s brand of sympathy

First we had Three Idiots which became a roaring success at the box office. Hello, Kai Po Che and 2 States followed. Now it is yet another Chetan Bhagat book which is converted into a movie that has taken on the wide screen.
Half Girlfriend originates from Bhagat’s novel of the same name. The story rotates around Simrao boy, Madhav, who is struck by a thunderbolt when he spots the Delhi lass Riya.
Half Girlfriend is definitely not one of Bhagat’s best works. It seems a mystery what these two characters share in common when he can barely speak a sentence in English while she acts like a British import. Even if both go for each other’s looks the tiresome and clingy manner in which Madhav hangs onto Riya would put any smart girl off a guy for good. However both seem to find common grounds in basketball and music. Thus an alliance forms which heads towards something which can be termed as a strange relationship.
You get many episodes which have been repeated in previous Bhaghat works. For example Riya unwinds on top of a peak - India Gate. This is a common feature in many of Bhagat’s heroes and heroines. Likewise despite his handicap Madhav wins the day though he does not strike out as the boyfriend many girls would like to take home to their mother.
Mohit Suri has included a few fun moments in Half Girlfriend. The comic bits come from watching Madhav desperately trying out ways to make Riya his ‘full time’ girlfriend but only ends up getting her approval to be his ‘half girlfriend’.
Commitment-phobic
You almost see a déjà vu performance from Arjun Kapoor from the one he gave life to in 2 States as Krish Malhotra. For those who enjoyed 2 States purely because of Alia Bhatt’s spunky performance Kapoor’s performance in Half Girlfriend is tiresome to watch. He needs to get away from these stereotype roles and show his acting prowess through more energetic characters.
Shraddha Kapoor does not deliver a significant performance as Riya. Viewers are suppose to be mesmerized by the free spirited dame but they are left baffled on what has become of Madhav so that he leaves his mother, their school and the gorgeous girl he begins to associate with on rebound to chase Riya across the world. It seems frustrating that Riya’s commitment-phobic nature is overdone in the film.
Only Vikrant Massey seems to give a pitch perfect performance as Shailesh, Madhav’s college buddy who gives sound advice. He is the one who notes that Madhav’s infatuation will turn into a fatal attraction some day.
Lacks reality
The film lacks reality as well. For instance the story goes to show that it is a cake walk to obtain a U S visa for an Indian. Madhav might have gotten a chance through his association with the Bill Gates Foundation but it is a mystery how Riya made it to an American Jazz bar.
One of the plus points in Half Girlfriend is that it is fast paced. However this seems to make the characters forget what they were talking about in the previous scene. The music is not worth a mention because only Manoj Muntashir’s Phir Bhi Main Tumko Chahoonga comes to mind. The rest of the music and lyrics are forgettable.
