New faces refresh Government

This week proved to be a very eventful one in the local political scene with several issues coming to the fore. Last week, we saw the resignation of Presidential Secretary P.B. Abeykoon over what he called “personal reasons”. Later on, Defence Secretary Eng. Karunaratne Hettiarachchi, who had succeeded Gotabhaya Rajapaksa, also tendered his resignation. This created vacancies for two of the top positions in the Governance structure.
When these two appointments were made after the formation of the Yahapalana Government in 2015, many who had the interests of Yahapalanaya at heart expressed reservations. Several websites which were supportive of the Yahapalana Government had mercilessly criticised the two officials. However, these faded away as the two officials settled into their respective jobs.
With the second anniversary of the Rainbow Coalition’s victory in August 2015 looming, the Government is now having a new look with a new Presidential Secretary as well as a new Defence Secretary in place. This time, two officials with impeccable credentials and a great track record have been selected for the two top jobs in the Government sector.
New Secretary to the President Austin Fernando, who assumed duties yesterday, is no stranger to high posts, having held several very senior positions. His most recent position was as Governor of the Eastern Province. A former Defence Secretary and reputed civil service officer, Austin Fernando retired as a senior official in the Sri Lanka Administrative Service (SLAS) before he was appointed as an adviser and later Governor, Eastern Province by the President. He has a Special Degree in Economics from the University of Kelaniya in 1980 and a Diploma in Agriculture from the School of Agriculture, Kundasale in 1981. He has a Masters in Development Management (MOM) from the Asian Institute of Management (AIM) Manila, the Philippines in 1995. He is one of the most experienced civil servants in Sri Lanka.
Fernando, an old boy of Richmond College, Galle, is the author of My Belly is White: Reminiscences of a Peacetime Secretary of Defence. He is reported to be writing an autobiographical book in Sinhalese which is due to be published soon. Addressing Presidential Secretariat staff after assuming duties, he encouraged the staff to discuss and present their ideas for projects that could benefit the country.
“Bring your different ideas about strengthening peace and harmony in the country to the table. It’s always what we want to do. We have to work as a family. We have to be open and ready to listen to new ideas from veterans as well as those who think out of the box. We are discussing a model of cluster formation of ministries. It is a model we are now thinking about to enhance the public administration,s efficiency,” he said.
New Defence Secretary, President’s Counsel Kapila M Waidyaratne was Senior Additional Solicitor General at the Attorney General’s Department. He has a Bachelor of Arts (Economics) from the University of Colombo and an MA in International Relations from the University of Colombo. He served as a trial attorney at the UN International Criminal Tribunal for former Yugoslavia from 1998-2003. He joined the Attorney General’s Department in 1983 and was confirmed in his ASG post in January 2015. He has represented the Department at many conferences here and aboard. He is an old boy of S. Thomas College, Mount Lavinia.
The Army Commander’s post also fell vacant with the promotion of former Commander, General Crishantha de Silva as Chief of Defence Staff. The Army’s Chief of Staff Lt. Gen. N.U.M. Mahesh Senanayake RWP RSP USP was appointed as the new Army Commander. He is the 22nd Army Commander of Sri Lanka. Prior to his appointment as the Army Chief of Staff on March 22, he served as Commander of the Jaffna Security Force Headquarters. Before he was appointed as the Commander, Security Forces - Jaffna, he served as the Military Secretary at the Army Headquarters. He joined the Sri Lankan Army in the year 1981, after receiving his education at Ananda College, Colombo.
Senanayake was sidelined by the previous Mahinda Rajapaksa Government on the basis that he had been loyal to Field Marshal (then General) Sarath Fonseka, who contested the January 2010 Presidential Election as the Common candidate against former President Mahinda Rajapaksa. Following the arrest of General Fonseka on flimsy charges following his defeat, many Army Officers who were believed to have been loyal to him were also subject to interdiction and/or harassment. Some of them migrated while those who remained in the Service were not granted due recognition and promotions. Many of those who had left the Service before retirement age were reinstated once the present Government came to power.
Lt. Gen. Senanayake has also served the staff appointment of Colonel General Staff, 52 Division and Brigadier General Staff at the Security Force Headquarters, Jaffna during the most critical phases of the humanitarian operations before May 2009. Senanayake had actively contributed to almost all the major military operations, conducted in the North and the East of Sri Lanka during a span of more than 30 years. He is a graduate of the prestigious United States Army Command and General Staff College and also had the distinction of working with the US Army as the Senior Manager Project Management of Afghan Operations and Strategic Planning for Civil Reserved Air Fleet (CRAF). Besides, he holds a Bachelor of Science (BSc) degree in Civil Engineering from the Jawaharlal Nehru University of India.
The events of last week left one other appointment to be filled. The President picked former Foreign Minister (2007-2010) Rohitha Bogollagama to be the new Governor of the Eastern Province, following the departure of Austin Fernando to Colombo to head the Presidential Secretariat. Bogollagama entered Parliament in 2000 from the UNP and crossed over to the SLFP in 2004. An old boy of Ananda College, Colombo, Bogollagama took oaths as an Attorney-at-Law in 1976. He had held the ministerial portfolios of Enterprise Development and Investment Promotion, Advanced Technology and National Enterprise and Industries. Bogollagama did not retain his seat at the 2010 Election and has largely kept away from active politics for a number of years.
Uma Oya
Uma Oya continues to haunt this Government, although it originated under the previous regime. The President has appointed a three-member ministerial committee to look into the whole saga. Minister Mahinda Amaraweera, a member of this committee, said their visit to the area was hindered by a group led by the JVP’s Samantha Vidyaratne. There are only two options on Uma Oya before the Government – stoppage or continuation. The Government is saddled between a rock and hard place, since much of the project has been completed and all the funds used for the projects would be in vain if it is stopped. On the other hand, the project risks causing further environmental and structural damage. A team of Norwegian experts will soon be in Sri Lanka to scrutinise the project and give their verdict. The Government is also probing claims that there had been corruption on a massive scale during the previous Government’s bidding process for Uma Oya, whose waters are to be diverted to the Hambantota area through a 20 Km long tunnel. Uma Oya naturally supplies water to the North Central Province, which is an equally dry area like Hambantota itself.
Garbage, the other most important public issue facing the Government, is constantly in the news. The government group which met under the patronage of President Maithripala Sirisena and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe has agreed to give full authority to the Megapolis and Western Development Ministry to end the issue with regard to waste disposal and management in the Colombo City. Deputy Minister Ranjan Ramanayake said the President and Prime Minister have agreed to give full authority to Minister Patali Champika Ranawaka to solve the waste disposal issue in Colombo city within six months. “Minister Patali gave an assurance that he can end the waste disposal issue within six months if he is given necessary powers. The President and the Prime Minister agreed to grant him authority to eradicate this issue soon,” Deputy Minister Ramanayake said. In a previous turn as Environment Minister, Ranawaka had initiated a recycling drive and other successful garbage disposal systems.
SAITM issue
Minister Ranawaka, who is no stranger to controversy, incidentally figured in a matter pertaining to the controversial SAITM issue. Ranawaka, perhaps the lone anti-SAITM voice in the Government, reiterated his demand that SAITM be shut down. Addressing the media at the Party Office in Battaramulla, Ranawaka stressed that SAITM should be legally abolished as a permanent measure and not as a temporary one pending the Supreme Court decision. Minister Ranawaka emphasised the necessity of ensuring justice for the students recruited for the medical degree during the past eight years. “The SAITM issue cannot be solved on the streets or at hospitals and it can only be solved through a transparent agreement between the Government and the SLMC followed by an in-depth analysis of the issue,” the Minister said.
Minister Ranawaka charged that the architect of SAITM was former President Mahinda Rajapaksa. Without stopping there, the Minister disclosed that the former President had actually intended to open three more private medical colleges. The Minister also expressed the view that Prof. Carlo Fonseka should continue to head the Sri Lanka Medical Council (SLMC). Meanwhile, the Government Medical Officers Association (GMOA) has apparently postponed their strike over the SAITM issue planned for today. No reason for the one-week postponement was immediately announced by the GMOA, but there was a severe public backlash over its last strike which hampered work at hospitals island-wide amidst the dengue epidemic.
There was some confusion over the fate of the Anti Corruption Committee Secretariat (ACCS), which many speculated could be shut down. However, all indications are that it will resume operations and continue the anti-corruption drive. A drive against corruption and action against corrupt deals of the previous regime was one of the main election pledges of the Yahapalana Government and the ACCS was the result of that pledge. Led by the Prime Minister, the secretariat has a sub-committee and a rapid response committee. The secretariat also has its own short-term and long-term goals. The secretariat functioned at its premises near Temple Trees for 28 months.
The Government has also turned its attention to the looming power crisis. Now that the LNG plant t Sampur has been ruled out, the Government has to meet that shortfall of 500 MW through other power projects. A solar power plant at the same venue will generate around 50 MW while a 240 MW wind power plant is also envisaged (Sri Lanka has an estimated total wind power potential of 5000 MW). The project aligns with the government’s targets to increase renewable energy share by up to 100 percent by 2030. The government has decided to build the wind and solar farms in the Northern regions because they receive less rainfall throughout the year than the rest of the country, and are therefore more suitable as locations for renewable energy generation. Unless immediate action is taken, the power issue threatens to become a huge political issue as well.
Public Utilities Commission of Sri Lanka (PUCSL), the electricity sector regulator has asked the Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) to develop 12 new scenarios which will provide different power plant combinations and submit on or before July 7. The PUCSL said these scenarios should be developed with updated prices for coal, natural gas and oil and with the cost of externalities (Social and environmental costs) and should be submitted together with input data. This should ensure that the CEB can meet the power demand for the next 20 years. Solar and the wind are likely to be a major driving force in the power mix. The Government has already started a Soorya Bala Sangramaya (Battle for Solar Power), a net metering solution for businesses, homes and factories.
Donor conference
Meanwhile, a four-member ministerial team has been established to make preparations for the upcoming donor conference to seek funding to rehabilitate the areas devastated by recent floods and landslides. The team headed by Finance and Mass Media Minister Mangala Samaraweera includes Special Assignments Minister Sarath Amunugama, Disaster Management Minister Anura Priyadarshana Yapa and Foreign Minister Ravi Karunanayake. Finance Ministry Secretary R.H.S. Samaratunga will act as the Secretary to the Committee. No date has been set yet for the conference, which is to be held in Colombo so that any donor representatives can tour the affected areas to check the damage first hand. This is likely to be a success with the Government’s new approach to international relations, talking of which the new Foreign Minister Ravi Karunanayake is already implementing some of the new policy initiatives. The former Government’s Look Africa policy is being replaced with careful adjustments, such as the proposed shifting of the Sri Lankan embassy in the Seychelles to Antananarivo in Madagascar, where a lot of Sri Lankans are engaged in the gem trade. Winning the world is a priority for the Government and Minister Karunanayake, though entirely new to the subject, is already proving his mettle. The forthcoming Donor Conference would add another feather to his cap.
