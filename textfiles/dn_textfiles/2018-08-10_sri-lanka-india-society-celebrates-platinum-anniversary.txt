Sri Lanka India Society celebrates Platinum anniversary

The Sri Lanka India Society celebrates its Platinum anniversary, coinciding with the Society’s celebrations of the 72nd Independence Day of India in Colombo, recently.
It was held under the aegis of its President T. S. Prakash and the Executive Committee.
The Guest of Honour was Indian High Commissioner to Sri Lanka Taranjit Singh Sandhu. Foreign Affairs State Minister Vasantha Senanayake was also present, a press release from the Sri Lanka India Society said.
The event reflected the ties shared by the two countries in several spheres – from cultural pursuits to science, education, technology and knowledge-sharing endeavours. For centuries, India and Sri Lanka have strived to create and sustain a special bond that was unique to both countries, reflected in shared interests, cultural ties and a common way of life.
High Commissioner Taranjit Singh Sandhu emphasized the significance of the deep ties between India and Sri Lanka. He said India has always been committed to supporting people-focused projects in Sri Lanka, while co-operating with Sri Lanka on several aspects of bilateral importance. With India increasingly engaged in a global role as a regional powerhouse of technology and business, Sri Lanka has an advantage of being its closest neighbour and partner that adds a special meaning to the relationship between the two countries, he said.
The evening included the felicitation of past Presidents of the Society, the distribution of its annual magazine ‘Maithri’ and cultural performances.
For 70 years, the Sri Lanka India Society had worked towards reinforcing a unique footprint of co-operation between India and Sri Lanka; comprising members whose commitment to the cause remains exceptional. Sri Lanka India Society continues to look forward to bigger and better ways of consolidating the distinctive bond between two neighbours in the Indian Ocean, the release added.
