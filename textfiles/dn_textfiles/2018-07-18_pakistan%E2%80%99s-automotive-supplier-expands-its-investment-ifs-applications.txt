Pakistan’s automotive supplier expands its investment in IFS Applications

IFS, the global enterprise applications company, announces that Millat Industrial Products Limited (MIPL) and Bolan Castings Limited (BCL), both part of Millat Group of Pakistan, have signed a contract to implement IFS Applications™.
The agreement sees IFS expanding its footprint in the Millat Group and follows closely the deal with Millat Equipment Limited.
IFS Applications will empower MIPL, Pakistan’s leading automotive supplier of high-quality acid batteries, to efficiently manage its production planning, which is a key factor of the business.
The IFS solution will provide MIPL with the ability to seamlessly integrate all aspects of the company’s production with its finance, manufacturing, supply chain, administration and HR processes.
“We chose IFS Applications so that we can derive a competitive advantage in the form of operational efficiencies,” said MIPL CEO, Raafey Zaman Durrani. “IFS presented us with a comprehensive solution that is agile, user friendly, cost-effective, and secure. IFS Applications has been very effective in our parent company and we are convinced that it will improve the efficiency of our division as well. We are looking forward to a rapid implementation.”
By deploying IFS Applications, BCL, a supplier of high-quality iron castings to the automotive industry, will increase efficiencies in manufacturing, supply chain management and marketing while also improving finance and HR.
Nisar Ahmed Mirani, CEO of BCL, said, “We are very impressed with the effectiveness of the IFS solution and are confident that its intuitive user experience will help our employees adopt and leverage the system rapidly. The fact that IFS Applications has been successfully deployed in other parts of the group gave us the confidence to replace our legacy business systems. We look forward to a long and mutually beneficial partnership with IFS.”
Poorna Bandara, Country Director for IFS in Pakistan, added, “It is with pleasure that we embark on these implementation projects together with MIPL and BCL, two leading companies in their respective fields. We are confident that IFS’s technology will bring about great improvements in efficiency, as well as greater visibility and integrity throughout the companies’ operations. IFS understand the business challenges associated with such a large-scale implementation and our team has extensive experience in working with clients in the automotive sector. With our expertise and best practices, we look forward to delivering an outstanding solution that will meet the high standards of MIPL and BCL.”
