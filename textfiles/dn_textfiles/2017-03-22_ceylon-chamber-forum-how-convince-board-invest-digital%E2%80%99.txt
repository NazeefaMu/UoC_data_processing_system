Ceylon Chamber forum on 'How to  convince Board to invest in digital’

The Ceylon Chamber of Commerce will hold a forum on 'How to convince Board to invest in digital’ to be held on March 24 to be held at the Hilton Colombo Residences.
The Chamber has lined up speakers from McKinsey, JKH, Sampath and FairFirst to discuss how corporates can get smarter on making decisions on digital investments at the ‘Future of Business’ Innovation Strategy and Learning Event’.
The speakers are McKinsey and Company (London) Partner Ganaka Herath, John Keells Holdings Deputy Chairman Ajit Gunawardena, Sampath Bank Senior Director Sanjiva Senanayake and Fair First Insurance CEO Sanjeev Jha.
The Immersive Breakout Session titled, ‘Understanding Digital to Invest in Digital and How to Convince Your Board,’ will focus on how senior executives in technology, finance and strategy can sharpen their decision making on digital investments in their companies, how ‘digital champions’ of the companies can make a strong case for digital investments, and how they can make Boards of Directors understand the importance of digital investments.
Although, most leading businesses are keen to leverage on digital technologies, many don't know where to start. The C-Suite may be behind the curve and not understand, or they do and find it difficult to convince investors and the Board to agree to go ahead with digitalisation of firms.
Most importantly, speakers will touch on how to align a digital strategy to an overall transformation strategy and how to avoid wasted digital investments.
The event will enable the participants to learn about driving innovation in their organizations, dissect what changes are happening now, what are on the horizon, and how their company can adapt to face the future.
The event is suited for officers and senior executives in technology, strategy, marketing, HR and new business development. More information on email [email protected].
