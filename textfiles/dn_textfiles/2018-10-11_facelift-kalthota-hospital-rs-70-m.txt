Facelift for Kalthota hospital at Rs. 70 m

Kalthota Base Hospital, Balangoda will be renovated by the Sabaragamuwa Provincial Council at a cost of Rs. 70 million.
At present, the hospital provides OPD treatment to about 500 patients daily. About 50 are inward patients.
The Provincial Council has taken steps to renovate and upgrade hospital facilities as the hospital had not undergone renovation for years.
The facilities at the hospital are not sufficient for the day-to-day requirements to render a quality service.
According to hospital sources, even though the hospital requires 14 medical officers, there are only seven in service.
Moreover, there should be eight more nurses and 13 minor staffers, Sabaragamuwa Governor Niluka Ekanayaka said.
