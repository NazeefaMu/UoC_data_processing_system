Chronicling a century’s mission

The names of people, places and events enable one to think of certain social trendsetting during a certain given time. Those who have led a blissful and resourceful life helpful to masses have been handed either as great or noble humans, who traversed a path for others to follow. Such a great and noble portrait comes from the life and works of the noble venerable Buddhist monk who dedicated his whole life to a spiritual mission.
He is known as Most Venerable Rerukane Chandawimala Thera. A peep into his life and works on the part of a Sinhala journalist Janaka Wettasinghe comes out in the form of a remarkable biography titled as ‘Nivi Senasina Rerukane Maha Nahimi’ (Sarasavi 2017). The chapters that go into the work initially came out as a series of religious features that appeared in Budusarana.
Lively and blissful
In 33 short episodes, the writer cum biographer Janaka Wettasinghe attempts to present a wide spectrum of the lively and blissful life of Most Venerable Rerukane Chandawimala Thera. He commences the writing process as a long journey with its humble beginnings in the life of a village lad who is destined to become a great scholar. The lad eventually follows the religious path culminating by becoming a Buddhist monk, giving vent to a blissful spiritual path.
Having had the chance of going to Burma, the young monk got to know more about the Buddhist texts as well as the Buddhist codes of learning to culminate into the realm of higher insights as found in the metaphysical teachings, known as Abhidhamma. As Wettasinghe traces, the learning of the protagonist is shown as dedicated to a peaceful life which paves the way for the search of solace in the writing process. The compiler shows step by step how the colossal number of books came to be written.
At the outset, the learned monk is depicted as a scholar who writes articles to a periodical titled as Sri Dharma Sri’. But the mere contributions to periodical are traced as a beginning. Thenceforth the reader is made to know here the very first Dhamma text titled as ‘Nirvana Vinishshaya’ comes to be printed. This beginning is shown as a turning point in learning and teaching.
Venerable Chandawimala Thera says that the writing process could be compared to a meditative process enabling to achieve a sublime state of the inner discipline, broadly known in the Buddhist teachings as Samma Sati (Right Concentration) commonly known as mindfulness. Though quite a number of booklets and learned articles have been written on the explanation of the four noble truths, the pioneer commentarial work known as Chaturarya Satya came from the Venerable Thera.
Remarkable writing
The number of times the work is reprinted is a testimony to the fact of its being well received by the masses in the country. It is cited that the most remarkable point about the writing process is that anybody who desires to borrow material thus embedded is given the chance to draw them out irrespective of barriers to copyright.
Wettasinghe surpasses the narrow barriers of the conventional ways of presenting a profile, by the technique of questions asked by disciples and responses on the part of the learned monk.
This technique is seen in Chapter 13, which is titled as Mithyadrustiyen Samyakdrustika Vata (From a heretic stage to the truthful state).
It is made to know that one whole compilation of the teachings of the Buddha comes to be known by the use of the technique in the work titled as ‘Dharma Vinishshaya’ (Analysis of the Doctrine). The learned monk had utilised the technique in order to help the seekers of the teachings of the Buddha, get to know the deep insights in the canons in a simplistic manner hitherto unperceived. One by one, the works of the Most Venerable Chandawimala Thera had come to be popular. As time passed, the contribution had been instrumental in the acquisition of honour both from home and abroad. He had the honour of teaching Abhidhamma at the university level. He too had the honour of receiving the highest titles pertaining to religious studies from various higher institutes around the world.
As far as possible, the Venerable Thera avoided the narrow social controversies that a monk could easily fall into. This had resulted in the form of a time-saving device for more learning, teaching and basically devoting more time for writing. The two works titled as ‘Abhidhamma Margaya’ and ‘Abhidharmaye Mulika Karunu’.
Hallmark feature
It is said that the learned monk had the clarity of mind to commence one work and conclude the same devoid of many changes in between. This had been a hallmark of the writing process as initiated by him as a discipline. Some works such as Pohoya Dinaya and Bauddhayage Atpotha come as notable popular books as used by both laymen and clergy.
The day to day spiritual material are taken into consideration pinpointing how they could be made to apply as blissful means of existence. In this direction, factors such as generosity (Dana), morality (Sila) and wisdom (Panna) and meditation possessing happiness are taken into consideration. Born on July 19, 1897, the Most Venerable monk passed away on July 4, 1997, completing hundred years of a life devoted to a spiritually resourceful existence. I sincerely feel that this is an ideal work transcending the narrow limitations of a profile and/or a biography.
Each page is packed with penetrative material guiding the reader concerned into the understanding of a spiritual path of a higher human being.
