Sigiriya frescoes copied for preservation

The Sigiriya frescoes and graffiti are being copied for preservation purposes, using modern laser technology, the Central Cultural Fund said. The Bamberg University in Germany, the Central Cultural Fund, the Archaeology Department and the Kelaniya University are engaged in this endeavour.
Many of the world sites including the Kandy Dalada Maligawa have been recreated using laser technology.
In the digital copying of the frescos, some areas that are faded and difficult to read could also be successfully copied and read, Kelaniya University former Professor B.D. Nandadeva said, addressing a media conference in Dambulla on Sunday. The Director General Professor Prishantha Gunawardena, Minister Wijeyedasa Rajapakshe, and Bamberg University expert representative Dr. Max Rahrig were also present at the press briefing.
Professor Nandadeva said the frescoes would not be damaged during this process. On the contrary, these digitised copies will allow foretelling any harm that would come to the frescoes in the future, which will allow precautions to be taken.
He also said the digitised copies of the graffiti would allow clearer images for reading and understanding.
Minister Wijeyedasa Rajapakshe said that other pre-historic cave art will also be preserved using similar technology in the future.
