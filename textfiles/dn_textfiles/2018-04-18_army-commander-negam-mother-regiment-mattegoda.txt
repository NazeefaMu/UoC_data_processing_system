Army Commander on negam to mother regiment at Mattegoda

Army Commander Lieutenant General Mahesh Senanayake showing his sense of gratitude to his mother regiment, Sri Lanka Engineers (SLE), visited the 5 Field Sri Lanka Engineers camp complex at Mattegoda on the New Year day (April 14) and joined the observance of New Year rites and rituals in a gesture of goodwill and concern to the Sri Lanka Engineers. Lieutenant General Senanayake was posted there soon after he was commissioned as a Second Lieutenant.
Reminding of the age-old tradition of visiting relatives in keeping with Negam Yama custom, the Commander joined SLE Officers and other rankers at the premises and boiled the auspicious milk pot as a sign of prosperity.
The 5 Field Sri Lanka Engineers at Mattegoda, which was so close to the heart of the Commander of the Army, being his mother regiment before he had the transfer to the Special Forces (SF) extended a warm welcome to the visiting Army Commander. The Commander quipped, “I feel I have almost come home with this setting in this background since this was my breeding ground. That is why I wanted to pay my gratitude to this place at first on this auspicious day of our nation at the dawn of the New Year.”
Lieutenant General Senanayake made the auspicious visit to the 5 Field Engineers Headquarters at the time the SLE was set to hold its Sinhala and Tamil New Year festival on a grand scale. Lieutenant General Senanayake afterwards joined hands together with members in the SLE camp and took part in several traditional games and features, associated with the occasion.
He inaugurated the day’s celebration, ‘Bakmaha Ulela 2018’ of the SLE, together with Major General Dudley Weeraman, Chief Field Engineer and Major General Dananjith Karunaratne, Director General General Staff (DGGS) at the Army Headquarters and had a couple of hours with the troops in the camp. The visiting Commander was welcomed by Major General Dudley Weeraman, Chief Field Engineer.
