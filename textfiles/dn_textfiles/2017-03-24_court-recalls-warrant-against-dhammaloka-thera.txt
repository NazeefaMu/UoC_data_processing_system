Court recalls warrant against Dhammaloka Thera

The Colombo Additional Magistrate yesterday ordered to recall a warrant issued against Ven. Uduwe Dhammaloka Thera of Alan Mathiniyaramaya Temple in Polhengoda for not appearing in Court over a private plaint filed against him for allegedly using loudspeakers causing a nuisance.
When the case came up before Additional Magistrate Dulani Amarasinghe, Dhammaloka Thera was ordered to be released on an additional surety bail of Rs.100,000. Dhammaloka Thera through his Counsel filed a motion and informed Court that he was unable to appear in Court at a previous occasion as he had been ordered to appear before Colombo High Court over another case. However, the Additional Magistrate observed that Dhammaloka Thera should have informed the difficulties through a lawyer without being unrepresented in the Magistrate’s Court.
Further Magisterial inquiry was put off for April 5.
On December 6, 2016, the Court had issued a conditional order preventing Ven. Uduwe Dhammaloka Thera from using loudspeakers causing a nuisance at Alan Mathiniyaramaya Temple in Polhengoda between 5 a.m. and 6 a.m.
The Court had made this order taking into consideration a private plaint filed by six parties including former Minister Milinda Moragoda and the Centre for Environmental Justice alleging that loudspeakers used by Ven. Uduwe Dhammaloka was causing an annoyance and disturbance to the residents. Through this private plaint, the six complainants sought the Court’s jurisdiction to avert noise pollution taking place in the area in terms of the section 98 of the Criminal Procedure Code.
The six complainants, Gavinda Jayasinghe, Dr. Kalinga Kaluperuma, Diren R. Halok, Milinda Moragoda, Kamalesh Johnpillai and the Centre for Environmental Justice informed Court that they were compelled against their will to listen to the amplified sounds which emanate from the loudspeakers at Alan Mathiniyaramaya Temple. They said the authorities turned a blind eye to their complaints made on several occasions.
