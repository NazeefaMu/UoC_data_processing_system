President opens Damma Mandiraya in Elpitiya

The two storeyed Damma Mandiraya of the Jayasumanarama Viharaya in Amugoda Elpitiya was open by President Maithripala Sirisena yesterday.
The building was named after the Ven. Sok In Von Thera of the Yakshasa Temple in Korea and the Ven. Thalalle Dhammaloka Thera.
The Jayasumanaramaya constructed in 1896 under the guidance of the Ven. Omanthe Abayathissa Thera was offered with this building by the Ven Sok In Von Thera and the Korean philanthropists.
