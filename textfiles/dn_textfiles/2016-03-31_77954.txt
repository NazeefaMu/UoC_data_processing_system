'Govt's reconciliation process severely hampered by Wigneswaran's attitude'

Northern Province Chief Minister P Wigneswaran's behaviour severely affects the reconciliation process initiated by the Government and its people in the South, said Jathika Hela Urumaya (JHU) Western Provincial Councillor Nishantha Sri Warnasinghe.
He stated that Wigneswaran boycotted the recent 32nd Chief Ministers' Summit in Galle as well as all the other previous summits. He said the government or the other chief ministers should explain to the country's people the reason why Wigneswaran boycotted all the summits as invitations were extended by the President.
"Wigneswaran too boycotted Cabinet meetings although the President invited all Chief Ministers to attend them to discuss the development programmes that are to be implemented in those respective provinces," Warnasinghe said. "It seems that Wigneswaran is promoting racism and separatism.
It seems that Wigneswaran does not accept the Lichchavi democracy promoted by the government's Good Governance theme to further discuss and disperse peacefully."
He made these observations yesterday at a press conference held at the JHU headquarters.
"The Northern Provincial Council has utilized only 20 percent of the allocations made by the Central Government since 2013," Warnasinghe said. The balance had been returned to the Treasury, he said. So they are not using those funds for the benefit of the Tamil people in North. They wish to keep those people in the North deserted with the idea of promoting separatism."
He said although Wigneswaran's Northern Provincial Council wanted more power, they have done nothing for the Tamil people in the North with the funds provided and presently existing powers.
Warnasinghe challenged Northern Chief Minister Wigneswaran to reveal the roads, bridges and other development programmes that they had implemented in the Northern Provincial Council for the benefit of the people.
He also said that the Sinhalese and Muslim people in the North have been deprived of their rights and equal status.
"Those Sinhalese and Tamil people have been deprived of their right to settle down at their selected places, education, language, religion etc," Warnasinghe said.
"The people of Bogaswewa in Vavunia are suffering severely due to this administrative harassment.
In 1984, the people in Nayaru and Kokilai were subjected to ethnic cleansing with weapons and the same is been done today," he said.
He added that all these problems could be discussed at the Chief Minister's Summit or at Cabinet meetings which Wigneshwaran is neglecting.
He said the government had to take stern action to bring Wigneshwaran into these forums or take the responsibility.
