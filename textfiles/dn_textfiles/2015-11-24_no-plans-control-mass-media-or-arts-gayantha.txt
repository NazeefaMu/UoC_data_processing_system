No plans to control mass media or arts - Gayantha

The government has no desire to impose any control or prohibition on mass media or arts, Parliamentary Reforms and Media Minister Gayantha Karunatilleke said.
Recalling the manner in which the telecast of teledramas had to be stopped half way due to political interferences during the past regime, Minister Karunatilleke said he believed that politicians in the present government would never try to act in a manner to censor the mass media or the arts.
The minister made these observations at the Diploma Awards ceremony of the Sri Lanka Media Training Institute at the Government Information Department on Friday.
He said politicians and artistes should always perform their duties properly without causing any hindrance.
Nearly 200 received their certificates from the minister and ministry secretary Vajira Narampanawa.
