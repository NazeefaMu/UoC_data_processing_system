Govt. calls for all CEB casual and temporary staff to report to work

 
The government has requested all casual and temporary staff and employees currently serving probationary period at the Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) to report to work with immediate effect.
The request comes on the heels of a request made earlier today asking staff retired after September 1, 2014 to report to duty on a voluntary basis to ensure uninterrupted essential services to the public.
The government is determined to provide uninterrupted electricity supply around the clock to more than 5.5 million customers and said that all employees who do not report to work would be considered as having vacated their positions.
Trade unions attached to the CEB are currently in their 4th consecutive day striking against the government are making over several demands which include the revision of the salary ratio from 1:6 to 1:9.
