Vandersay included for first match after suspension

Sri Lanka selectors have included right-arm leg-spinner Jeffrey Vandersay for the second 4-day unofficial test match between Sri Lanka Emerging team and South Africa Emerging team scheduled to begin today at the Mahinda Rajapaksa Stadium, Hambantota.
This is Vandersay’s first game since being sent home early on the tour of West Indies in June before the third and final Test on a disciplinary breach.
He was later after an inquiry punished with a one-year suspended ban and fined 20 percent of his annual contract after admitting a misconduct charge.
Vandersay replaces left-arm spinner Malinda Pushpakumara who bowled SL Emerging to a four-wicket win in the first unofficial test at Katunayake last week.
SRI LANKA EMERGING TEAM FOR 2ND UNOFFICIAL TEST: Kaushal Silva (captain), Pathum Nissanka, Charith Asalanka, Sadeera Samarawickrema, Shammu Ashan, Lahiru Milantha, Kamindu Mendis, Nisala Tharaka, Jeffrey Vandersay, Lahiru Gamage, Binura Fernando, Reserves: Chamika Karunaratne, Madawa Warnapura, Hasitha Boyagoda.
