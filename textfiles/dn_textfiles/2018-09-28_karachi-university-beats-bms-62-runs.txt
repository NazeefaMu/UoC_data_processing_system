Karachi University beats BMS by 62 runs

A rollicking 76 of 38 balls from opener Shahzar Hassan, and No. 3 batsman Arsalan Farzand’s 56 off 41 balls, propelled Karachi University to a mammoth 204 for 5 from their 20 overs, which proved 62 runs too many for local team Business Management School (BMS). The pair struck 11 sixes and 10 fours between and put on a partnership of 71 for the second wicket. Karachi’s bowlers were then excellent in the second innings, as left- arm spinner and captain Muhammad Asad claimed another three-wicket haul - his second in two games.
BMS opener Hashan Dumindu made a valiant 76 off 55 balls, but had little support from his teammates.The team slumped to 142 for 9 from their 20 overs.

Mahbubur Rahman, the left-arm wristspinner, from University of Liberal Arts Bangladesh (ULAB), tore through the Herriot-Watt University middle order, as ULAB claimed a 26-run victory in their final match of the tournament.

Herriot-Watt had made a decent start to the chase, moving to 55 for 2 in the 10th over, before Mahbubur trussed up their middle order in the space of a few overs. ULAB took four wickets for seven runs, to leave Herriot-Watt in trouble at 66 for 2, before they eventually slipped to 103 all out in the 17th over.
