Hemal Gunasekara appointed as Fisheries Corp. Chairman

Former State Minister Hemal Gunasekara yesterday assumed duties as the Ceylon Fisheries Corporation (CFC) Chairman.
Addressing the media after assuming duties, the new Chairman pledged to do his best to uplift the living standards of fishermen.
"Fisheries is not a new subject to me. As a person who lives in a coastal village, I feel the pulse of the fishing community. So I will do my best to improve their living conditions," said the new Chairman.
Not only the fishermen, the CFC has the responsibility of providing fish at a fair price for the consumers and will try to do that, he added.
