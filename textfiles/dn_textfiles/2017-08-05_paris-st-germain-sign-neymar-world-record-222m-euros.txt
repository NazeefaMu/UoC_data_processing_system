Paris St-Germain sign Neymar for world record 222m euros

PARIS: Paris St-Germain have signed Brazil forward Neymar for a world record fee of 222m euros (£200m) from Barcelona.
The deal for the 25-year-old smashes the previous record set when Paul Pogba returned to Manchester United from Juventus for £89m in August 2016.
He will earn 45m euros (£40.7m) a year - 865,000 euros (£782,000) a week - before tax from the initial five-year deal, a total outlay of £400m.
Neymar said he has joined "one of the most ambitious clubs in Europe".
"Paris St-Germain's ambition attracted me to the club, along with the passion and the energy this brings," he added.
"I feel ready to take the challenge. From today, I will do everything I can to help my new team-mates."
The French side have arranged a news conference for 12:30 BST on Friday.
Neymar will then be introduced to fans on Saturday at PSG's first game of the season against Amiens at Parc des Princes.
PSG reached the last eight of the Champions League last season - knocked out by a Neymar-inspired Barcelona - and were beaten to the French title by Monaco.
After weeks of speculation, Neymar arrived for training with Barcelona on Wednesday with his father and representative, and told the Spanish club he wanted to leave. BBC
