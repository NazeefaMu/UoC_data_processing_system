MPs on inspection tour of Port City site

A group of MPs made an inspection tour of the Port City site and went on board Asia’s largest trailing suction hopper dredger “Jun Yang 1” on February 22. China Harbour Engineering Company (CHEC) engineers explained the details of the operation, including the process and timeline of the project. The inspection tour was requested by Chief Government Whip Gayantha Karunathilaka and facilitated by the Megapolis and Western Development Ministry.
