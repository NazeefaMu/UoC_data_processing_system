JO’s no confidence motion against PM an illusion - State Minister

State Minister Dilip Vedaarachchi adresssing a meeting at the UNP office at Tangalle said that the Joint Opposition consists of a gang that robbed the resources of the country and those who involved themselves in various corruptions and malpractices.
It was this gang that will present to the Parliament a no confidence motion against the Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe who is reputed as clean politician without any allegation of whatsoever.
The State Minister said that Mahinda Rajapaksa led the Provincial Council Election to become the Prime Minister. It was a dream. Since he will not get the premier post, now the Joint Opposition is urging him to take the post of Leader of the Opposition.
The State Minister said that he was not aware of such a leader in the world as Mahinda Rajapaksa who reached the highest post of President, who contested an electorate to become a Parliamentarian later.
His other dream is to crown his prince who has played out a colossal sum of state funds and public property.
Is such a prince suitable to become a leader of the country? the State Minister asked.
