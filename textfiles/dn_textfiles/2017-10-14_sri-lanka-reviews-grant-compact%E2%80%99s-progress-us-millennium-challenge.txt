Sri Lanka reviews Grant Compact’s progress with US Millennium Challenge Corporation

Finance and Mass Media Minister Mangala Samaraweera who is in Washington, USA, to attend the WB/IMF annual meeting, on the sideline of its meeting met Regional Deputy Vice President for Europe, Asia, Pacific and Latin America in the Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC) Fatema Z. Sumar to review the progress of its five- year Grant Compact to Sri Lanka.
In December 2016, MCC’s Board of Directors selected Sri Lanka to develop a compact. Sri Lanka became eligible for assistance after passing 13 out of 20 indicators on MCC’s policy scorecard.
MCC is an independent agency working to reduce global poverty through economic growth. MCC’s grants and assistance to Sri Lanka is an immense contribution to Sri Lanka’s efforts for good governance, fighting corruption and to protect and promote human rights.
Sri Lanka is receiving about USD 700 million within a period of five years from the MCC to invest in three priority areas - policy stability, access to land and transport.
A delegation from the US Government’s Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC) led by Fatema Z. Sumar, visited Colombo in July to advance progress on the development of the MCC compact—a five-year grant program—with the Government of Sri Lanka that aims to reduce poverty, and promote economic opportunity for Sri Lankans.
During the visit, following the signing of an MoU with the Secretary to the Treasury Dr. R.H.S. Samaratunge, MCC announced Rs. 1.1 billion ($7.4 million) in funding to Sri Lanka to support the development of a compact, including identifying and analyzing specific projects for potential investment.
The Sri Lankan Government has established a project management unit—the Sri Lankan Compact Development Team—within the Prime Minister’s office to work with MCC on the compact. The goal is to develop a high-quality, evidence-based and sustainable compact aimed at addressing these economic challenges in a way that drives growth and reduces poverty. MCC holds partner countries accountable through rigorous oversight, monitoring and evaluation.
