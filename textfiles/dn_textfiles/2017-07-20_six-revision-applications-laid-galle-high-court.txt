Six revision applications laid by Galle High Court

Galle Provincial High Court Judge M.U.Gunawardana ordered to lay by six revision applications submitted to him seeking a review of a Galle Magistrate Court order endorsing legal authority of Police to execute legal action under the Excise Ordinance of Sri Lanka.
The High Court Judge issued the order in consideration of a submission by State Counsel Kanishka Rajakaruna. He said similar legal matters were being argued in the Appeal Court under Case No. C/A/M.L./R.B./9/17 and pleaded that proceedings of the cases be laid by until the verdict of the Appeal Court case is delivered.
Galle Chief Magistrate A.Nishantha Peiris earlier had asserted that the Police Department is empowered to initiate legal proceedings before a Magistrate Court connected to liquor and beer related cases. The magistrate made the affirmation when he delivered a retained order regarding objections challenging the legal empowerment of police to prosecute offenders of liquor related violations.
DIG Ajith rohana and SP Ruwan Gunasekara appeared for the Police Department and Prasthi Walgama Attorney-at Law looked after the interest of vehicle owners.
