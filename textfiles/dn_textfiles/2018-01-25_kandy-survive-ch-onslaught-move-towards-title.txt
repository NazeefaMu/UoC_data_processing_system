Kandy survive CH onslaught to move towards title

Kandy Sports Club maintained their lead in the points table and also their unbeaten record when they powered themselves to a hard fought victory over CH & FC 34-23 at Nittawela on Saturday. This was the most looked forward to match in the tournament’s second round where CH & FC had two consecutive wins prior to this game.
Kandy’s scrambling defence had to be at its very best to keep CH at bay. The defending league champions were given a tough time by CH before winning. It was a combination of their sheer hard work, grit and determination that they were able to overcome a gallant CH team. Kandy came out firing on all cylinders and played a very bruising game. They stood up to the challenge and stuck to the game plan with all the players rising to the occasion.
The CH lads gave their best, but Kandy knew how to turn on the heat at the right moment. There were some good individual play, but CH failed to use them and paid for it dearly. The good work of their back-row forwards was fine, but their backs struggled with handling errors. CH packed with some good players, should have done much better in this game but failed to drive home the advantage, due to poor co-ordination. Sad to say Kandy school product Samuel Maduwantha was not in his normal form, and had left his kicking boots at home.
The ongoing strength and conditioning training have been a big help with the Kandy forwards and the backs making all the difference in such a well contested game.
The second half was an absolute teaser, CH & FC were by no means awful, but every time they made a mistake, Kandy capitalized. Playmaker Fail Marija operating from the fly half position cut holes everywhere and also fullback Nigel Ratwatte.
From 77 per cent territory and possession in the first half Kandy had to survive on 21 and 23 per cent after the break. CH comeback in this half was a dramatic transformation at the scrum.
In the first half, Kandy was dominant, though CH did not falter. They did not break, keeping the champions at bay for the final half an hour of the game with their defensive resistance. They had saved the best of their play for this game.
What a terrifically-entertaining match! All credit to the Kandy players who outclassed the hard fighting CH XV, who put real pressure on the defending champions.
Kandy play their next game on Saturday at Welisara against second placed Sri Lanka Navy.
