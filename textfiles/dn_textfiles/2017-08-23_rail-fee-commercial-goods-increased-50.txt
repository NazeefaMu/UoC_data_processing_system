Rail fee on commercial goods increased by 50%

 
The fee for the transport of commercial goods by rail is to be increased by 50 percent.
The fee increase was approved by Cabinet this week following a cabinet paper submitted by Minister of Transport and Civil Aviation, Nimal Siripala de Silva.
The new rate would not impact on non-commercial parcels so that the general public will not bear any added cost due to the increase.
The Minister had pointed out that the fees had not been revised in the last nine years and that they were very low compared to other transport services.
