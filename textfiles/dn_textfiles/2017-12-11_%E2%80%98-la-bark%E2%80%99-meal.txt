‘A la bark’ meal

Chefs have created the ultimate mouth-watering dish - for dogs .
The mega-posh meal, which has been dubbed ‘a la bark’ was put together by experts at gourmet dog food brand tails.com .
While the dish looks good enough for humans to eat, the centre-piece is actually chunks of the company’s lamb hotpot, cooked with vegetables and dog-friendly gravy.
Guaranteed to tickle the taste buds of any self-respecting hound, the dish also features a base of bespoke kibble blend.
It is topped off with a garnish of purple shiso and also features a swoosh of carrot puree, both of which provide beneficial nutrients for our four-legged friends. Green beans, kale, pea shoots and rosemary are also included.
The meal was unveiled to the delight of local dogs at The George pub in Wedmore, Somerset. Tails.com came up with the creation to showcase the nutritious and high-quality ingredients in their kibble and wet food recipes.
Head vet Sean McCormack said: ‘’Dogs enjoy all sorts of foods and there is no reason why they can’t be treated to an a la carte dish once in a while, they are after all man’s best friend.
“Noodle, who is a cavapoo, loved the lamb hotpot with rosemary, carrots and green beans. He is sensitive to chicken and beef so lamb is a healthy, lean protein source important for his growth and development. Carrots and green beans were included because they are healthy vegetables, full of fibre and antioxidants. The secret to a great diet for your dog is high-quality ingredients, tailored to their individual needs and in the right amount, to keep them healthy and happy.”
Sean added: “Every dog in the UK deserves a great dining experience.” Mirror
