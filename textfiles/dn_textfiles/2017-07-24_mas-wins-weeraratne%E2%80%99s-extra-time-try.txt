MAS wins on Weeraratne’s extra time try

Roshan Weeraratne’s superb extra time try enabled MAS to grab the 47th Mercantile Rugby Sevens title when they beat favourites and defending champions Access by 19 points (3 tries, 2 conversions) to 14 (2 tries, 2 conversions) in the Cup championship final played yesterday. The entire tournament was worked off at the Race Course international Stadium, Reid Avenue.
This victory by the MAS team is a fitting tribute to their experienced former Sri Lanka national skipper Fazil Marija who executed and inflicted a superb brand of attacking rugby and dished out a fabulous team game together with the entire team.
For the victorious MAS team the tries were scored by three quarters Anurudda Willawara, Sadun Herath and Roshan Weeraratne - one try apiece. Roshan Weeraratne put over the two conversions as well. Three quarter Richard Dharmapala scored both tries for Acces with Chanaka Chandimal slotting in both the conversions.
