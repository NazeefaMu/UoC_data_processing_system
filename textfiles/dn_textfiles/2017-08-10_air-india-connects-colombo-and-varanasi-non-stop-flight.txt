Air India connects Colombo and Varanasi with non-stop flight


 
India's flag carrier Air India commenced twice weekly flights on August 4 to Varanasi and the inaugural flight touched down to a ceremonial water salute at the Bandaranaike International Airport.
The flight heralds a new era in aviation and tourism between the two neighbouring countries.The inaugural flight was flagged off by Air India Chairman and Managing Director Ashwani Lohani.
Air India has deployed a brand new Airbus A-320neo aircraft on the route. The 180-seater, all-economy aircraft will leave Varanasi at 12.35 pm and reach Colombo at 3.20 pm.
The flights will operate on Fridays and Sundays. This operation will also facilitate Hindu pilgrims in their travel to the great city of Varanasi.
Currently, Varanasi has one regular international flight: to Sharjah once a week. Other direct flights to Thailand and Kathmandu operate on a seasonal basis, from September to March, when tourist influx into the city is high. Apart from these, 22 domestic flights make 44 operations per day from this, an airport official said.
Varanasi is a major religious hub city and the holiest of seven sacred cities (Saptha Puri) in Hinduism and Jainism. Saranath where Enlightened One Buddha gave his first discourse to five ascetics is close by.
Varanasi is also a major healthcare city with many hospitals.
Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, when he visited Sri Lanka for the Vesak Day celebrations, promised that he will initiate a direct flight to Varanasi. Air India occupies a special place in the global and Indian aviation scenario. It pioneered aviation in India and its history is synonymous with the history of civil aviation in India.
