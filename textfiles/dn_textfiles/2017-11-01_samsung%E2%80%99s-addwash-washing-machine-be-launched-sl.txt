Samsung’s AddWash washing machine to be launched in SL

Samsung Sri Lanka announces that Samsung’s award winning AddWashFront Loading washing machine range is soon to be launched in Sri Lanka.
The innovative features of Samsung’s AddWash range have been developed, taking into consideration consumer insights and feedback, which makes the state-of-the-art washing machines the best in its class.
Activities such as adding left-out clothes even after the wash cycle has started, allowing hand washed clothes to go through a spin or rinse cycle and other unique features are available on the Samsung AddWash washing machines.
Furthermore, AddWash washing machines are recognised as the world’s first to incorporate such a feature such as adding laundry even after the wash cycle has commenced, addressing a common consumer pain point identified by Samsung through product innovation. Given the fact that front loader machines normally get locked until the wash cycle is completed, the flexibility to add laundry once the cycle has begun truly fulfills this much-felt consumer demand. The AddWash series from Samsung comes with a secondary door which enables consumers to add laundry in this manner with ease.
Enabling consumers to interact with the washing machine has been a key area of development for Samsung which constantly seeks ways to improve consumer interaction with their products. It also enhances the flexibility offered to consumers in terms of adding detergent, fabric softener etc.
With a digital inverter motor delivering exceptional energy saving benefits and Eco Bubble, the machines are packed with outstanding features such as less noise, durability and long lasting performance.
