Decision on further extending Interim Order regarding former Defence Secretary:
CA reserves order for April 5

The Court of Appeal yesterday reserved its order for April 5 to decide whether the Court further extends its Interim Order preventing the police from acting against former Defence Secretary Gotabhaya Rajapaksa under the Public Property Act regarding a Magistrate's Court inquiry.
Meanwhile, Court of Appeal (President) Justice Preethi Padman Surasena and Justice Shiran Goonaratne yesterday further extended until April 5 its interim order preventing the police from acting against former Defence Secretary Gotabhaya Rajapaksa under the Public Property Act over a complaint that the D. A. Rajapaksa Museum and Memorial in Medamulana was built using public funds amounting to Rs.90 million.
Senior Deputy Solicitor General Viraj Dayaratne appearing on behalf of the Attorney General raised objections for the extension of the Interim Order since it had been issued on the basis of an ex parte proceeding. President’s Counsel Romesh de Silva appearing for Gotabhaya Rajapaksa moved Court that an Interim Order be issued until the final determination of this application and fixed the matter for argument.
The Court of Appeal yesterday announced that it will issue an appropriate order in this regard on the next date.
On November 29, 2017, the Interim Order was issued on the basis of an ex parte proceeding.
The Court had upheld Rajapaksa’s version that the certificate issued under Section 8(1) of the offences against the Public Property Act is ultra vires or violative of his legitimate expectations.
Rajapaksa cited IGP Pujith Jayasundara, CID Director Shani Abeysekara, FCID Director Ravi Waidyalankara and the Attorney General as respondents.
Rajapaksa also seeks an order in the nature of a writ of prohibition preventing the respondents from proceeding or relying upon the certificate filed under and in terms of Section 8(1) of the offences against the Public Property Act against him.
President's Counsel Romesh de Silva under the instructions of Counsel Sanath Wijewardena appeared for Gotabhaya Rajapaksa.
Senior Deputy Solicitor General Viraj Dayaratne with Deputy Solicitor General Dilan Ratnayake and Senior State Counsel Udara Karunatilleka and SSC Nirmalan Vigneshvaran appeared for the Attorney General.
