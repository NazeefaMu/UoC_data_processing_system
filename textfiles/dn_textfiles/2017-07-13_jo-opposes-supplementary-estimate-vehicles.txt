JO opposes supplementary estimate for vehicles

The Joint Opposition yesterday said that they oppose the recent supplementary estimate presented before parliament for the buying of new vehicles and renovation of living quarters for Parliamentarians.
Addressing a media briefing at the Dr. N.M. Perera memorial hall in Borella, MP Dinesh Gunawardena said they will take all measures to stop the estimate from being passed.
“They can use all this money to give better facilities to the patients suffering from Dengue” he said. He said President Maithripala Sirisena had also made a statement rejecting the need for such luxuries for parliamentarians.
“What is required is simplicity in everything.
The country does not need these luxuries at a time like this” he said.
Prof. G.L Pieris said they oppose the Enforced Disappearances Act which is contrary to Government claims.The Act has retrospective effect, he said.
Parliamentarian Dallas Alahapperuma also said that the Joint Opposition was planning to hold an island-wide protest against the government.
“The protests have been held on a piecemeal basis, but we intend on joining all opposition forces across the country against the government,” he said. The conference was also attended by leaders of the Joint Opposition including Prof.Tissa Witharana, and Mahinda Yapa Abeywardena.
