Perpetual Voice Recordings given without data

The Attorney General’s Department yesterday said that the telephone recordings submitted by Perpetual Treasuries did not contain times, durations, outgoing and incoming numbers, unlike the voice recordings submitted by three other entities.
Deputy Solicitor General Milinda Gunathillake informed the Commission that the voice recordings in possession amount to 240,000.
“In some recordings it was completely silent for 15 minutes. We were given an overload of information. None of the recordings had the numbers or duration. Three other entities gave us their recordings and it had all the details,” he said.
Counsel for Perpetual Treasuries Nihal Fernando PC responded by stating that he had instructed his clients to not tamper with any of the recordings and to hand over them as they are.
“If we had done anything with it then you would’ve have accused us of tampering,” he said.
Thereafter, DSG Gunathillake said that all the Department seeks was the data in a coherent form, as given to them by all other entities, and if such could not be provided to place it on the Commissions record that it could not.
Counsel Fernando said that he would seek instructions from his clients with regard to the possibility of providing the duration, time and numbers to the Commission today.
