NUTRIENT-RICH YOGHURT

Yoghurt is often included on healthy food lists. Yoghurt is highly nutritious and is an excellent source of protein, calcium and potassium. It provides numerous vitamins and minerals and is relatively low in calories.
Yoghurt is a cultured milk product that is soured and thickened by the action of specific lactic acid-producing cultures added to milk. The lactic acid produced by the culture coagulates the milk protein, thickening the milk and adding the characteristic sour flavor. The starter cultures—or probiotics—used to make Yoghurt are Lactobacillus bulgaricus and Streptococcus thermophilus.
Health Benefits of Yoghurt
Other probiotics are often added to Yoghurt for their health effects. Some common ones are Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus casei and Bifidus. These probiotics can help maintain the balance of bacteria necessary for a healthy digestive system; boost the immune system, shortening the length and severity of sickness; and may reduce eczema in babies.
When taking antibiotics, many people suffer unpleasant side effects such as diarrhea, intestinal pain and/or bloating. This is because some antibiotics upset the balance of bacteria in the digestive tract. Eating foods rich in probiotics may help relieve these side effects of antibiotics.
Yoghurt is a component of the DASH (Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension) diet designed to reduce the risk of high blood pressure. This diet, which includes three servings a day of low-fat and fat-free milk, Yoghurt and cheese, and 8 to 10 servings of fruits and vegetables, has also been shown to reduce risk of heart disease and stroke.
Ways to Eat Yoghurt
Yoghurt is extremely versatile. You can dip it, spread it, freeze it, add fruit to it or eat it plain. Here are some other ideas:
