Tussle over film distribution drags on

The dispute over the rights of distributing local and foreign films in Sri Lanka continues. A press conference was held recently by the four private film circuits: Lanka Film Distributors Ltd. (LFD), E.A.P. Films and Theatres Ltd. (EAP), Movie Producers and Importers Ltd. (MPI) and Cinema Entertainment Ltd. (CEL), to discuss the matter further. Film exhibitors, producers, directors, importers and circuit operators too expressed their views at the event.
A stay order from the Colombo District court preventing NFC taking over the film distribution rights from private sector has been obtained. The film distribution companies noted that the abrupt decision to take over the distribution of films is unfair and a matter that should have been discussed with them to note the issues in the current situation.
“We do not want to clash with the NFC or the Minister. We only wish for a fair system,” stressed film producer, distributor and exhibitor Sunil T Fernando. Renowned film director Parakrama Jayasinghe ointed out that some deficiencies in the film distribution methodologies had added fuel to this move.
“Film distributors are keen to select only films of popular directors in their theaters. They also do not look into the needs of the patrons in some cinemas. For example the stink of the lavatories engulf film halls. The standards of the cinema halls and equipment too are poor,” he said adding that there is a need to address these problems.
Popular filmmaker Priyantha Colombage said that the private film circuits always pay them on the dot and support them immensely to publicize their films. Nalaka Vihtanage noted that he is unsure of what to expect from the descision taken by NFC. He added that the payment system and the facilities that will be given by the NFC is not clear and this is a worrying fact for filmmakers. This will actually discourage filmmakers and producers in engaging in filmmaking.
The film distribution companies noted that the freedom of choice of the moviegoers and the exhibitors to choose the content will be disrupted by the move. The quality of content too will become an issue as many of the unreleased films that have been queuing throughout the years are not fit for screening. Stifling competition will not improve the quality of the industry.
“The movie industry has grown in Sri Lanka after 2009. The investment in ciemas too has substantially increased. We were planning to invest in building more cinemas outside Colombo,” CT Holdings PLC Group Corporate Affairs Director Sanjay C Niles said.
Ceylon Theaters CEO Pravin R David noted that NFC should acts as a regulatory bodym rather than take over the film distribution.
“They have handled the matter previously with disastrous consequences. This was from 1979 to 1990. Handing distribution back to NFC is too much of a risk,” he expressed.
The Ridma circuit which falls under the NFC distributes around 1/3 of the cinemas. The new decision also states that film halls that will be built in the future will also have to be under the flagship of the NFC.
Ceylon Theatres (Pvt) Ltd (Ceylon Theatres) is the oldest theatre operator in the country and a subsidiary of C T Holdings PLC. They have hosted the Jaffna Film Festival and will be partnering with ANCL for the 34th Sarasaviya Film Awards.
