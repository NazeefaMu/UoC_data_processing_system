SLAF assists in dousing fire on MV Daniela

The Sri Lanka Air Force deployed a Bell 212 Helicopter with Bambi bucket to assist in dousing the fire that erupted on board the container vessel MV Daniela in the seas off Colombo. The fire had started when the vessel was over 100 Nautical Miles off the coast of Sri Lanka. The SL Navy dispatched two Fast Attack Craft to the location to assist Sri Lankan Port Authority tugs to bring the vessel to within 10 Nautical Miles of the Harbour. The SLAF Bell 212 Helicopter was dispatched early last morning to assist the Navy and the Harbour Authorities in dousing the fire.
