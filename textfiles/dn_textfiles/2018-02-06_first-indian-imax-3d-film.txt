First Indian Imax 3D film

“Padmaavat”, previously titled ‘Padmavati’, is an Indian Hindi-language epic period drama film with English Sub-titles. It is directed by Sanjay Leela Bhansali and features Deepika Padukone in the title role as Rani Padmavati, alongside Shahid Kapoor as Maharawal Ratan Singh and Ranveer Singh as Sultan Alauddin Khilji. Aditi Rao Hydari, Jim Sarbh, Raza Murad and Anupriya Goenka feature in supporting roles.
Based on the epic poem Padmavat (1540) by Malik Muhammad Jayasi, the film set in 1303 AD medieval Rajasthan, narrates the story of Padmavati, a legendary Rajput queen who committed jauhar to protect herself from Khilji, a ruthless Muslim king. It is the story of honour, valour and obsession. Queen Padmavati is known for her exceptional beauty along with a strong sense of justice and is the wife of Maharawal Ratan Singh and pride of the Kingdom of Chittor, a prosperous kingdom in the north west of India.
The legend of her beauty reaches the reigning sultan of Hindustan – Allaudin Khilji. The sultan who is a tyrant, is fixated with wanting anything that is of exceptional beauty for himself. He lays siege on the impregnable fortress of Chittorgarh. After a grueling 6 months, he returns empty handed. He becomes obsessed and now wants to capture Chittor and its Queen at any cost. He returns with a bigger army and ranging fury. He attacks Chittor with brutal force and a bloody and fearsome battle takes place between the righteous Maharawal Ratan Singh defending his kingdom and the honor of his queen and Sultan Allaudin Khilji. Khilji manages to breach the fortress but in vain as the Queen chooses to make the ultimate sacrifice to protect her dignity
“Padmaavat” is full of captivating action, excellent music and deserves a high rating for its acting and film direction. It is a movie worth watching.
