Fitting finale for BDFI

The Ballroom Dancers Federation Sri Lanka added another feather to their cap when they were awarded the Sports Contribution Medal Award at the recently concluded SLT Silks Sports Award 2016 at the Waters Edge.
The event was organised by Sports Info who have come forward to promote all sports in a big way and Sri Lanka Telecom.
This was a fitting finale for a decade of successful dance sport completed by BDFI.
