The Bay of Bengal is the largest bay in the world and it covers an area of 2,172, 000 sq. km. The bay boasts of a population of about 1.8 billion or nearly 25% of the world population. Many large rivers and tributaries flow in to the Bay depositing sediments, which contain commercially exploitable minerals as well as hydrocarbons.
Port of Trincomalee is the biggest natural deep water harbour in the Bay of Bengal and is one of the finest harbours in the world with an average depth of 25 m, which could accommodate even mega container ships carrying over 18,000 TEUs that requires a draught of 19 meters.
The government has unveiled a plan to develop various parts of the island including Trincomalee. Recognizing that poor infrastructure acts as a drag on development plans, the government has launched an ambitious programme of physical infrastructure development to overhaul the sea, air, road connectivity, the energy sector and telecommunications, to form the backbone of Sri Lanka's economy.
In addition to the development projects involving Colombo and Hambantota harbours, government has also taken measures to develop Trincomalee to realize the full potential of the Trincomalee harbour and its surrounding areas.
