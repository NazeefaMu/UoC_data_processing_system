Let dreams take flight

Head Girl of Newstead Girls’ College Negombo Ruwandi Aluthweera is a voice for Social Conscience and Nature. Perfect Prefects feature Aluthweera an advocate for burning issues and matters that require immediate attention.
Aluthweera is extremely concerned about environmental and social issues, believing in a clean and ordered society and world.
Living beings
“Living together harmoniously with other human beings should not be our only concern. We should be mindful of the fact that we share this world with other living beings. There are so many endangered species, and we need to protect them before they disappear forever. I am completely against killing animals to satisfy ones egotistical desires,” explained Aluthweera.
The gravity of this problem outlined by Aluthweera may be fully understood if one does his or her own research on the web, and finds out that a very large number of species are critically endangered to the point of extinction.
In addition to this problem concerning nature, Aluthweera outlined a problem that is at once social and psychological, which involves mainly humans.
‘We are not born into this world with hate in us. We discriminate because our societies have taught us to do that. That is why there is colour, racial, religious and gender discrimination. If children are taught to love, they can spread it all over the world. That can change the world,” said Aluthweera.
Priorities
Proper manners and consideration for others also rank highly on her list of priorities.
“I dislike seeing the road littered with paper bags and all sorts of discarded items. When I see junk on the road, I think to myself – ‘Why can’t people learn to be clean and orderly?’ Sometimes I pick up the trash and put it into a rubbish bin. It is one small thing I can do, but if I can do it and everyone does it, the world will be a beautiful and clean paradise to live in. I think people should be more concerned about the environment they live in. We must recycle as much as possible,” points out Aluthweera.
Having a social conscience is one of the most important things in life. Even simple things like keeping a toilet clean which are used by the public indicates what kind of a person you are – whether you are responsible and empathetic or indifferent, disorderly, unclean and untidy.
Nature is the most beautiful asset we have on earth. It is the earth itself. We take trees for granted. Trees are like a second mother to us. Most of us do not realize they provided us with oxygen. They are life givers. They can live without us. But we cannot live without them. We, humans, emerged long after Mother Nature.
Over a million seabirds, whales, seals, dolphins, sea turtles, and so on have died from plastic debris that ends up in our oceans and seas. 100,000 sharks are also part of the death toll. Plastic ends up inside these animals (especially birds), which can lead to their deaths. The impact of plastic pollution in our oceans and ecosystems creates chaos for the environment.
Universe
“There is a whole world out there beyond the classroom. A whole world to discover and explore. Science is the light that helps us see the universe. The governments of this world need to take swift action to save our eco-systems before it is too late. They need to do a lot more than what they are doing now, and act because various life forms on earth are under threat,” added Aluthweera.
Aluthweera also pointed out the need for equality, saying that it is the duty of the public and private sector to treat people equally.
“I feel that institutions need to treat everyone who comes for their services equally without differentiating. Sometimes they favour politically or socially powerful individuals over the common man. That is why I say that they should treat everyone equally,” said Aluthweera.
Development
Aluthweera did not forget to thank her father and mother for what she has become and also extended her thanks to the Principal of Newstead, the staff and her colleagues and committee members.
“My parents are both doctors. They are my biggest inspiration. I have seen how they both help the sick. This has motivated me to become a more caring and better person. My school has done so much for me. I remember at a Leadership training program, we were taught to think out of the box, to be creative and come up with solutions. We need to look at the bigger picture and put things in perspective,” stated Aluthweera.
Aluthweera also pointed out that knowledgeable people must be in positions of authority in our society. This affects the progress and development of the country.
“We need leaders who care about the problems the people in the country face and genuinely want to do something about it. We also need to learn from history and prepare for the future. But we also need to remember that we have to live in the present,” explained Aluthweera.
Aluthweera also emphasized on the fact that one does not need to face one’s problems alone. She does not have to face problems alone because there are so many who love her, help her and support her. She is currently doing her A/Ls in the bioscience stream and hopes to go to university one day and become a doctor.
“The ideal role model for young people is someone who can relate to young people, who know their thoughts and someone who has experience in life. My school has given me so many opportunities to gather new experiences and to do what I have not done before. I firmly believe in leading by example,” said Aluthweera.
