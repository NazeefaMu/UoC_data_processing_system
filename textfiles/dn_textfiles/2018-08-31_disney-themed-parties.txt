Disney themed parties

A stay-home-mum who runs a 'professional princess' business now earns up to £100 an hour after stepping in to help at her friend's party three years ago.
Rachelle Douglas, 32, spends most of her time dressed in elaborate costumes and puts in around 35 hours of rehearsal time every week.
Her princess act is a full-time job and she confesses to spending hours watching the films over and over again to get her performance just right.
She reluctantly first put on a costume three years ago stepping in during a kids party as a favour for a friend but ended up falling in love with the characters.
Dedicated Rachelle then set up her own business, Make It Magical Entertainment 18 months ago and it has snowballed ever since.
She performs as Belle, Elsa and Ariel at 'princess parties' but under different names such as the snow queen and sea princess.
Rachelle from Gateshead, Tyneside, often visits poorly tots in hospital in full costume as part of her dedicated charity work.
The mum-of-four works around 40 hours a week with only five of those actually spent at parties - the rest consists of mending and cleaning costumes, learning songs and rehearsals. But the biggest chunk of her working week is spent studying Disney flicks - perfecting the outfits, makeup and mannerisms. Rachelle charges £50 for turning up in character to a party for 30 minutes. The average party usually lasts around two hours. But business is booming and she has been inundated with bookings - with no sign it will slow down anytime soon.
However, there's a lot of prep involved and Rachelle spends an hour-and-a-half getting ready each time.
"I do spend quite a few hours every week rewatching things," she added.
