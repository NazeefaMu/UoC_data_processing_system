Visiting UK surgeon’s work temporarily suspended

Karapitiya Teaching Hospital Director Dr. Jayampathy Senanayake instructed that the services of visiting British cardiac surgeon Dr. R.K. Permin to be temporarily suspended.
Dr. Permin frequently visited the Cardiothoracic Unit of the hospital to perform heart surgeries.
Dr. Senanayake made his decision known through a letter to Cardiothoracic Unit Cardiac Surgeon Tolusha Harishchandra, Paediatric Surgeon Dr. Kapilani Vithanarachchi and Anesthesiologist Dr. Nirosha Perera.
The letter states that the decision was taken upon the advice of the Director General of Health Services as the GMOA had protested against Dr. Permin’s expired license to practice and his out-of-date registration with the UK Medical Council.
Thus, Dr. Jayampathy informed the specialists that he would be stopping all surgeries and work carried out by Dr. Permin at the Karapitiya Teaching Hospital temporarily.
Meanwhile, the Karapitiya branch of the GMOA said the Director General of Health Services had promised that a comprehensive investigation into this matter would be carried out.
