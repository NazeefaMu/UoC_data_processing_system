SL misses boat to World Rowing Junior C’ships

Sri Lanka has missed the boat to take part in the World Rowing Junior Championships 2018, which takes place from August 8 to15 in Racice, Czech Republic as the local federation has not sent entries to the sport's international governing body, FISA.
According to World Rowing Federation (FISA) sources more than 750 rowers from 38 countries have sent their entries and are preparing to race at the 2018 World Rowing Junior Championships in Racice.
By the time entries closed for the junior rowing championships on July 9, Sri Lanka had not submitted its list of rowing athletes to FISA.
Asked about this lapse, sources close to the federation said, this was the result of selectors not performing their role.
Asked if the federation had any issue with finding suitable rowers to participate in the event, they said the federation has a junior rower with ranking at the World Rowing Junior Championship.
The Ministry of Sports had assisted these rowers at the international regatta organized by FISA in 2016 and 2017.
