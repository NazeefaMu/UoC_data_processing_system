Thomas Bayes and the crisis in science

We are living in new Bayesian age. Applications of Bayesian probability are taking over our lives. Doctors, lawyers, engineers and financiers use computerized Bayesian networks to aid their decision-making. Psychologists and neuroscientists explore the Bayesian workings of our brains. Statisticians increasingly rely on Bayesian logic. Even our email spam filters work on Bayesian principles.
It was not always thus. For most of the two and a half centuries since the Reverend Thomas Bayes first made his pioneering contributions to probability theory, his ideas were side-lined. The high priests of statistical thinking condemned them as dangerously subjective and Bayesian theorists were regarded as little better than cranks. It is only over the past couple of decades that the tide has turned. What tradition long dismissed as unhealthy speculation is now generally regarded as sound judgement.
We know little about Thomas Bayes’s personal life. He was born in 1701 into a well-to-do dissenting family. He entered the Presbyterian ministry after studying logic and theology at Edinburgh and lived in Tunbridge Wells for most of his adult life. Much of his energy seems to have been devoted to intellectual matters. He published two papers during his lifetime, one on theology, and the other a defence of Newton’s calculus against Bishop Berkeley’s criticisms. The latter impressed his contemporaries enough to win him election to the Royal Society.
Probability theory
The work for which he is best known, however, was published posthumously. Bayes died in 1761, but for some time up to his death he had been working on a paper entitled “An Essay towards Solving a Problem in the Doctrine of Chances”. His work was passed on to his friend Richard Price, who arranged for it to be presented to the Royal Society in 1763. Bayes’s essay marks a breakthrough in thinking about probability.
Probability theory was in its infancy in Bayes’s day. Strange as it may seem, before the seventeenth century nobody could calculate even such simple chances as that of a normal coin landing five heads in a row. It wasn’t that the information wouldn’t have been useful. There was plenty of gambling before modernity. But somehow no one could get their head around probabilities. As Ian Hacking put in his groundbreaking The Emergence of Probability (1975), someone in ancient Rome “with only the most modest knowledge of probability mathematics could have won himself the whole of Gaul in a week”.
By Bayes’s time, the rudiments of probability had finally been forged. Books such as Abraham de Moivre’s The Doctrine of Chances (1718) explained the basic principles. They showed how to calculate the probability of five heads on a normal coin (it is 1/32) and indeed more complex probabilities like five heads on a coin biased 75 per cent in favour of heads (that would be 243/1024 – about ¼). At last it was possible for gamblers to know which bets are good in which games of chance.
Not that the Reverend Bayes was any kind of gambler. What interested him was not the probability of results given different causes (like the probability of five heads given different kinds of coin). Rather he wanted to know about the “inverse probability” of the causes given the results. When we observe some evidence, what’s the likelihood of its different possible causes? Some commentators have conjectured that Bayes interest in this issue was prompted by David Hume’s sceptical argument in An Enquiry Concerning Human Understanding (1748) that reports of miracles are more likely to stem from inventive witnesses than the actions of a benign deity. Be that as it may, Bayes’s article was the first serious attempt to apply mathematics to the problem of “inverse probabilities”.
Piece of string
Bayes’s paper analyses a messy problem involving billiard balls and their positions on a table. But his basic idea can be explained easily enough. Go back to the coins.
If five tosses yield five heads in a row, then how likely is it that the coin is fair rather than biased? Well, how long is a piece of string? In the abstract, there’s no good answer to the question. Without some idea of the prevalence of biased coins, five heads doesn’t really tell us anything. Maybe we’re spinning a dodgy coin, or perhaps we just got lucky with a fair one. Who knows?
What Bayes saw, however, was that in certain cases the problem is tractable.
