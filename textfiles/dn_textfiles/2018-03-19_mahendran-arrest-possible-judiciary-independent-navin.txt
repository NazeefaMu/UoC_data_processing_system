Mahendran arrest possible since judiciary is independent: Navin

An open warrant for the arrest of former Central Bank Governor Arjun Mahendran had been issued because the Courts of Justice are fully independent today, Plantation Industries Minister Navin Dissanyake said.
He was speaking to the media after presiding over a workshop on quality upgrading attended by high officials of palntation companies recently.
Minister Dissanyake said they firmly subscribed to the view that a person found guilty by a Presidential Commission of Inquiry should be brought before courts.
A majority of the UNP members too subscribed to this opinion. He said the Prime Minister made the statement in Parliament because he had some confidence in Mahendran.
"They too as leaders made statements believing people whom they trusted. But the Prime Minister did not try to deceive Parliament wilfully by making that statement. Neither had the Commission said that he tried to provide wrong information," he said. Minister Dissanayake said Mahendran would not be able to be on the run evading arrest for too long. "A person engaged in wrong-doing would get caught sooner or later," he said.
"Sri Lanka had very close ties with Singapore and this issue should be resolved with Singapore amicably without harming our mutual relations," he said.
He said he believed that if Sri Lanka requested Singapore to hand over Arjun Mahendran since he is wanted by law enforcement authorities, Singapore would accede to the request sympathetically.
