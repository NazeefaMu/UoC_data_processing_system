Cornet into Brisbane final after Muguruza withdraws

BRISBANE AFP Jan6, 2017 : Unseeded Frenchwoman Alize Cornet reached the final of the Brisbane International when Spain's Garbine Muguruza withdrew while trailing 1-4 in the opening set of their last four clash on Friday.
Muguruza, the tournament's fourth seed, had three long matches heading into the semi-final and was on court for more than seven hours.
She called for a trainer after the fifth game but decided she could not continue.
Cornet will play either third seed Karolina Pliskova of the Czech Republic or sixth seeded Ukrainian Elina Svitolina in Saturday's final.
