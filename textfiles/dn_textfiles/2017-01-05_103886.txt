Govt. adopting various ruses to put off LG polls

The real reason for pointing out various issues such as the Delimitation Committee report etc in connection with holding the Local Government Election is for the purpose of delaying it, Front Line Socialist Party Propaganda Secretary Pubudu Jagoda said.
Addressing a press conference in Colombo yesterday, Jagoda said all political parties, especially the two main political parties very clearly know that they are going to be defeated at the next Local Government polls.
“Only the TNA is confident of winning it. Other political parties are scared of the people because they face rejection at the polls,” he said.
Jagoda said the main intention of political parties is not bringing in a more democratic and people friendly electoral system. Their intention is retaining power with it. Purely, it is a power struggle and they have placed their last bet on it.
“Now they do not have any more tricks to play to mislead and cheat the people. Therefore, they are delaying the LG polls,” he said.
The Public Representations Committee on Constitutional Reforms is just a joke and a tactic used to mislead the public because nobody can expect that ordinary people will take leave from their work and travel to the place where this committee sits spending their money and time,”he said.
“No previous Constitution in Sri Lanka has been approved by the people through a referendum. There is no legal requirement for that. But, it is an ethical requirement. Definitely, this so called new constitution framed without the people’s active participation will be passed without the people’s approval. There is no doubt about it,” he added.
