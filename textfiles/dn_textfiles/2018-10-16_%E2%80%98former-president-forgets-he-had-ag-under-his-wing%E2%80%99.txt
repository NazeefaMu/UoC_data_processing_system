‘Former President forgets he had AG under his wing’

The former President who accuses us of interfering in the affairs of the Attorney General forgets the manner in which he kept the Attorney General’s Department under his wing during his regime, said Justice and Prison Reforms Minister Talatha Athukorale.
The former President seems to have forgotten the manner in which he interfered in the Judiciary by issuing marching orders to the then Chief Justice Shirani Bandaranayake by giving her 24 hours to vacate office, she said.
The Minister was speaking at the opening of the Ratnapura – Mudduwa road, built at a cost of Rs. 12.6 million, recently.
Minister Athukorale said notwithstanding all allegations and challenges levelled by opponents, the government would continue its full term until 2020. The UNP would not remain idle despite losing the Pradeshiya Sabha elections. They had entered politics to serve the people with good intentions.
As Ministers, they always endeavoured to safeguard the honour and integrity of their onerous posts. They also believed in the principle that political power is transient and not eternal, she said.
They would not try to cling onto power by hook or by crook as some people tried to do in the past, the Minister said.
