Training for 500,000 in disaster relief work

The Government will soon start training 500,000 volunteers capable of providing frontline services during disaster relief operations, Disaster Management Minister Palitha Range Bandara said.
These volunteers will work alongside government officials, police, security forces and other stakeholders to address the immediate needs of those affected by natural disasters.
Speaking to the media at the end of a public event in Kandy, the minister said these volunteers will be recruited from all parts of the country and they will be divided among 37 identified zones.
As a first step, the minister said, 100,000 chosen volunteers will be trained in necessary skills related to disaster relief work in this year. The trained volunteers will be capable of support response and recovery efforts as well, he said.
