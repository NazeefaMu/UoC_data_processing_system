Following the success of The Flemington Rajagiriya, the luxury property developer is set to begin construction on its second condominium complex. The Flemington 103 Campbell will be built to the highest internationalspecifications with an emphasis on 21st century urban family life.
The 103 Campbell is a sequel to the highly successful Flemington project in Rajagiriya which has already seen an 87% sale rate.The Flemington Rajagiriya is scheduled to hand over the keys to the apartment owners by the end of 2018.
The complex is located on Nawala Road, a mere 100m from the new flyover, making it a living space of high demand and great convenience. The Flemington Rajagiriya has four 3-bedroom apartments remaining.
“Combining inspired styling with practical consideration for modern living, The Flemington 103 Campbell offers both duplex and apartment style living for those who value the convenience of location without sacrificing the comforts of contemporary lifestyle,” EliSh Development Managing Director Shamitha Ganegoda said.
Each apartment is designed to let in as much natural light as possible, with a high level of occupant comfort, the company said in a statement. Despite its luxurious finish and quality guarantee, The Flemington 103 Campbell promises to offer affordable pricing to its potential investors.
