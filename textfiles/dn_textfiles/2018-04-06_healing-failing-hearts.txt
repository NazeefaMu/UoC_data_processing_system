Healing the failing hearts

Gift of Life International, CEO, Rob Raylman visited Sri Lanka recently to discuss and extend the ongoing support of the organisation to Sri Lanka. The Rotarian-based organization which operates with a global mission to heal the failing hearts of thousands of children assured the organization’s support for the waiting list of children with congenital heart problems at the Lady Ridgeway Children’s Hospital in Colombo.
In 2016, The Gift of Life Sri Lanka funded the ‘After working hour cardiothoracic surgery’ program at the Lady Ridge Way Children’s Hospital by paying US$ 1,000 per surgery. With this initiative, the organisation was able to fuel hope for children with congenital heart problems by enabling them to undergo heart surgery before they reached adulthood.
The organization has sponsored a two phase nurse training programme at the Lady Ridgeway hospital as there is a need to enhance the skills of the critical care nurses in order to improve patient outcomes.
Due to certain logistical issues that are being sorted out at the Lady Ridge Way Hospital, Gift of Life Sri Lanka with the help of donors performed 23 heart surgeries on children at Asiri Surgical Hospital recently.
It is estimated that in Sri Lanka, for every 1,000 newborns, there are 6-8 born with congenital heart problems (CHD).For a total of 329,000 live births occurred in Sri Lanka, 2,000-2,700 children are born with CHD each year. Two thirds out of them (about 1,300-1,800) will need surgery/intervention for their heart lesions to be corrected. With treatment, 85-90 per cent of them reach adulthood.
Commenting on the visit, Rob Raylman said “We are proud to see the commitment and the leadership displayed by local health professionals towards this cause. Since 1975, through our global network of caring, we have provided hope to more than 30,000 children with the help of our 81 affiliates around the world.
