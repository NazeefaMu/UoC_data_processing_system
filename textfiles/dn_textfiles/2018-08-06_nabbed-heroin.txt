Police had arrested three suspects possessing 100mg of heroin during two raids conducted at Serupitiya in Girandurukotte, Ginnoruwa and Ginnoruva, on the Giraandurukotte – Mahiyanganaya road, recently.
Upon receiving a tip-off, police had raided a hut at a paddy field and arrested a suspect possessing 40mg of heroin and following information obtained through interrogations, intercepted a three-wheeler with two suspects travelling in it.
Two packets of heroin, one weighing 20mg and another weighing 40mg, were detected in their possession.
