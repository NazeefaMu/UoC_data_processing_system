Bates’ Sheron Jayasundara wins Top 50 Professional  & Career Women Gold Award for Advertising

Balancing a demanding job with child-rearing and running the home smoothly is the daunting task that most working women have to face. Sheron Jayasundara, the Chief Operating Officer of Bates Strategic Alliance has performed this task with such admirable skill that she became this year’s Gold Award winner in the Advertising Category at the ‘Top 50 Professional & Career Women’s Awards’.
Bestowed by Women in Management in partnership with International Finance Corporation (IFC) - a member of the World Bank Group, the highly prestigious accolade is a fitting recognition of Sheron’s strength in managing both her professional career and personal life with equal aplomb.
Now in its seventh edition, the award recognizes women who inspire others, especially ambitious young people, with their success in both career and everyday life.
WIM’s theme for 2017 is ‘Beyond Parity – Developing Tomorrow’s Women Leaders’ and the award is an apt celebration of the winner’s ability to perform efficiently and effectively, seizing opportunities and overcoming challenges that come her way.
Tracing Sheron’s progression at Bates illustrates how she was able to face the challenges that crossed her path with a great deal of female intuition.
She joined Bates as an account manager in 1997 and is now running the company’s flagship advertising operation as the Chief Operating Officer.
“At the time I went into advertising in the early 1990s it was before the advent of computer creativity and I was lucky to have worked in all departments – from audiovisual productions, to media and client servicing,” said Sheron.
“None of this would have been a reality if not for my husband Sudath Jayasundara. It was Sudath who guided me to the field of advertising and also encouraged me to do my CIM (UK) exams. Today, I love my work because of the tremendous support and confidence placed on me by our Chairman, Nimal Gunewardena, who gives me the strength I need to overcome the daily challenges we face in the advertising industry. I’m also proud to say that 50% of our professional staff at Bates are women,” she said.
Sheron was elected President of Association of Accredited Advertising Agencies (Four As) and has been maintaining this position since 2015, adding considerable value to the advertising industry. There were several significant initiatives introduced after Sheron became President of 4As. “We want to have more young people joining the industry. So we tied up with the Sri Lanka Press Institute to introduce a diploma course in corporate communications to attract people into advertising and PR, getting them to see the value of joining the industry,” Sheron saidd.
As President, Sheron was also able to muster the support of the entire industry to implement the much needed professional pitch disbursement fee. “We have many ideas to bring the professionalism, vibrancy and excitement back to the industry,” said Sheron explaining her role and her aspirations as the head of 4As.
