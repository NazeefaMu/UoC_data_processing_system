Performance against India was my lowest point of 2015: Hashim Amla

 
DURBAN: South African captain Hashim Amla has singled out his horrible performance in the recently concluded Test series in India, especially the Delhi Test as one of lowest points of the year 2015.
Asked about the low points of 2015, Amla after his team's 241-run loss said:"I think this match (England Test) and probably one in Delhi."
Amla conceded that it was time for him to start leading from the front with the bat, attributing his continued batting woes to a lack of confidence rather than poor technique. "It started off well last year when I got some runs but not being able to maintain it has been disappointing. Certainly as captain you want to lead from the front." "Hopefully I can turn it around in the next match, start leading from the front by getting the runs on the board so that the boys can follow," Amla said. "Not scoring the runs has been our Achilles' heel for a couple of Test matches; that's probably the most disappointing. It's been disappointing for everybody," he said. "I certainly think it's a confidence thing and we don't know how long it will go on for but we hope that we are close to turning it around.
Dean (Elgar) started it off brilliantly, his hundred has been the positive light from this Test match for us.
He batted well in India and the way he batted in this game is a good lesson for everyone."
Amla started off his captaincy tenure in 2014 with series wins against Zimbabwe, Sri Lanka and the West Indies, but in 2015, his record has been less rosy, with a rain-affected drawn series against Bangladesh and the loss to India last month. But there is no talk of stepping down.
Rather, Amla said his hunger and desire to captain South Africa was even more than what it was before. "I definitely do (have the hunger)," he said when asked if he wanted to continue with the captaincy. "I've enjoyed every minute of it and it's just been disappointing not to get the runs. In the middle of a Test series like this the hunger to get runs on the board is getting more." PTI
