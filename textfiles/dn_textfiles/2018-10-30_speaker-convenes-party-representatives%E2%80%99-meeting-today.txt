Speaker convenes party representatives’ meeting today

Speaker Karu Jayasuriya has convened a meeting of party representatives for a special discussion in Parliament today. The Speaker’s Office confirmed that they have received a letter signed by 129 Members of Parliament asking that Parliament be convened immediately to resolve the current political crisis in the country.
As a result the representatives of the parties represented in Parliament would meet tomorrow at 11 am to decide on the future course of action. President Maithripala Sirisena on Saturday (27) prorogued Parliament until November 16. Political parties have asked that the Speaker convenes Parliament so that both parties can show the required majority to decide on who should be the legitimate Prime Minister of the country.
