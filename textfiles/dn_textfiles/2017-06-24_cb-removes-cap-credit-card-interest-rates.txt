CB removes cap on credit card interest rates

Move to discourage rise in personal borrowings:
The removal of the cap on credit card interest rates is expected to help slow down the rising levels of personal and household debt in the country.
Central Bank Governor, Dr Indrajit Coomaraswamy addressing a media briefing at the Central Bank yesterday said one of the reasons why the Central Bank felt comfortable about removing the cap was because they have seen a significant increase in personal borrowings.
“The indebtedness in households has been increasing to the point where in our view, there were grounds to put some sand in the wheel and slow that down a little bit”, he added.
It is up to the Banks the Governor said to set the interest rates in their own products and given that there were 26 licensed banks in the country, he expected enough competition in the market to have a competitive rate.
“This is not very productive lending and if the price of that goes up, money can be redirected to more productive activity and it will be better for the economy”, he added.
Sri Lankan Banks in the meantime have increased the interest rates by as much as 4 percent since the Central Bank directive and the interest rate for credit cards at present stands at 28 percent per annum.
The interest rate cap of 24 percent was lifted from credit products such as credit cards and housing loans among others. The new rates will come into effect from July 1 2017.
“It is possible to argue that the sharp increase we see is because we interfered with the pricing of risk by putting a cap on it. The risk premium attached to that borrowing came down and you saw a significant increase in unproductive lending”, said the Governor as he explained the logic for the removal of the cap.
Rising household debt has been a major issue in the country over the past couple of years with the war torn economies of the North and East being the most affected. The Governor in May stated that the Central Bank would undertake a study on the growing indebtedness of households in these provinces who are struggling to rebuild their lives stuck under a mountain of debt and poverty.
