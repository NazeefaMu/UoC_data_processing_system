Country’s education system needs total revamp  - Dr. Amunugama

Foreign Minister Dr. Sarath Amunugama yesterday said the country’s educational system does not reflect the capabilities or the determination of young people in the country.
The Minister said the existing education system does not produce the type of young persons who can take the country forward.
“Roughly around 250,000 youth seek university education a year in the country and only 30,000 get into universities. This is no reflection of the capabilities or the determination of young people”
The Minister stressed the importance of acquiring knowledge on the latest trends of education and technology if the country needs to make progress.
“We cannot think of a progress unless we achieve latest trends of education and technology,” he said.
Dr. Amunugama was speaking at the convocation of Londontec City Campus held at the BMICH yesterday. Dr Amunugama conferred degrees to a group of promising students who completed the BSc in computing.
The Foreign Minister queried as to what country can do for hundreds and hundreds of capable young people who miss university admission by one mark in the Z-Score or they were not in the best of spirits when they faced the examination. He emphasized that young population in the country should be given an opportunity to contribute the future of the country by ensuring them easy access to modern day technology and management skills.
“We have very advanced educational and health systems The country has a safety net for less advantaged people in the country,” he added.
He added that the government has a responsibility to see that these young people are trained in the modern trends in education by looking at their aptitudes and help them to make contribution to the country’s progress.
The Minister added that investors coming to Sri Lanka raise questions about the number of young persons trained in modern technologies and management and vital industries in sciences.
“If we do not have people trained in modern trends in education and technology, our country will not attract new industries,” he said.
He predicted that young population trained in modern technological trends would be main thrust in the country’s economy in the years to come.
“Today we are going through an information society, a knowledge based society and we are talking of cloud computing and artificial intelligence. We are thinking of all sorts of new communication methods which are changing everyday.The young population in Sri Lanka are best adjusted to make use of this new technology,"he said.
Londontec City Campus Principal M. H. A. Zulfer was also present.
