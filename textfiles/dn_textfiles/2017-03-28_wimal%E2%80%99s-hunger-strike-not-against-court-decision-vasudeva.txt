Wimal’s hunger strike not against court decision: Vasudeva

The National Freedom Front leader Wimal Weerawansa’s hunger strike in prison should not be misinterpreted as a slur against the Court decision to remand him, parliamentarian Vasudeva Nanayakkara said yesterday.
Speaking to the media in Colombo, Nanayakkara said Weerawansa was protesting as he had no other ways to propagate his opposition against several harmful decisions taken by the government.
Nanayakkara said Wimal was protesting against the rising cost of living, attempts to sell key state assets and harmful clauses in the proposed new constitution.
The parliamentarian said Weerawansa believes that he is being politically victimised.
Nanayakkara said Weerawansa’s family is under a great distress because of the current developments and his daughter was hospitalised due to mental stress. The government should take responsibility if either Weerawansa or any of his family members come to harm, Nanayakkara said.
