Rathana Thera wants harassing of intelligence officers stopped

Parliamentarian Ven. Athuraliye Rathana Thera urged the relevant authorities not to harass intelligence officers of the three forces by taking them into custody on various unjustifiable allegations.
Ven. Rathana Thera addressing media yesterday in Colombo representing the “The National Council of Sri Lanka” said several intelligence officers who had rendered a yeoman service to the country during the LTTE terror period, are taken into custody especially by the Criminal Investigation Department (CID) and by other investigating bodies without any acceptable or justifiable reason.
“These intelligence officers have been arrested and remanded on various charges, which are not acceptable. Certain officers have been taken into custody by the CID based on a statement given by someone. The officer is in remand after being produced before courts under section 296 of the Penal Code,” the Thera said.
Rathana Thera added that the President or Prime Minister is not fully aware of this situation. He said all these incidents may have occurred as an outcome of international mediation. “I think the tri forces commanders are notified when intelligence officers are to be taken into custody. There should be a separate investigation by the security forces into the charges. If there is any basis for the allegations, further measures can be taken,” the Thera said.
However, he said the National Council of Sri Lanka never objected to conducting investigations against intelligence officers on acceptable and justifiable grounds. But, the issue is that intelligence officers are being harassed on fabricated charges, he pointed out.
When asked by media who is behind this issue and what international mediation is involved, the Thera said that the National Council of Sri Lanka is ready to reveal all details soon once it is confirmed.
