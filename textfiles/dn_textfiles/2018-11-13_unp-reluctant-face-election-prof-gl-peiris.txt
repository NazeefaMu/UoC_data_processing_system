UNP reluctant to face election - Prof. G.L. Peiris

Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) Chairman Prof. G.L. Peris said yesterday the UNP is reluctant to face the forthcoming General Election as it is facing certain defeat.
“That is why UNP members are trying to block the election by going to the courts because they know that they cannot win it,” he added.
Addressing a media briefing in Colombo yesterday, he said that former Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe should not go to foreign embassies or Courts when an election has been announced.
“Rather he should go to the villages to meet the people. But his defeat is already visible by his actions. That is why he is going before courts and foreign embassies. He will never give up the UNP leadership,” he added.
Former MP Rohitha Abeygunawardena said that according to predictions, the SLPP has a chance of winning a two-thirds majority at the forthcoming General election.
Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa will be nominated from the Kurunegala district. Hambantota SLPP team will be headed by former MP Chamal Rajapaksa while former MP Namal Rajapaksa will contest from the same district.
