The dos and don’ts of EYE MAKE - UP

When it comes to eye make-up, it can transform your look in a jiffy. Be it a classic kajal look or wing liner, your eye make-up can be the focal point of your face. Getting eye make-up right is quite challenging, but following few tricks and how to blend the rest of the make-up can make you look like a beauty pro. Here are a few rules you must follow to master your eye make-up:
1. Don’t wear too much make-up
When it comes to sporting heavy eye make-up, you should keep the rest of the make-up minimal, unless you want to look like a disco ball. Go for natural-looking blush and minimal highlighter.
2. Avoid bold lipsticks with heavy eye look
Similarly, a bold lipstick may not be the best choice for smokey eyes or heavy glitter make-up. You can try colours that blend well. Think nude shades or light shades like pink, brown, etc.
3. Use a mascara for light shadows
If you’re using a light shadow like a silver one or pastel hues, make sure you define your eyes with a mascara. This will help intensify your eyes and not make you look washed out.
4. Don’t forget to groom your brows
Always make sure you groom your brows when sporting eye make-up. So, fill in your brows and shape them well, as all the attention will be around your eye area only.
