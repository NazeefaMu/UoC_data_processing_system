WIM connecting Sri Lanka and Canada through women professionals

Women in Management (WIM), an organisation committed to empower and recognise Sri Lankan women in careers, businesses and professions has taken a huge step to recognise Canadian women of Sri Lankan origin on January 20, 2018.
Commenting on the occasion, Dr. Sulochana Segera, Founder/Chairperson of Women in Management said, “Our objective is to brand Sri Lankan women nationally and internationally. During the last seven years WIM Sri Lanka has recognised more than 400 women who have excelled in their careers and businesses through Professional and Career Women Awards. Last year the awards were extended to the Maldives as well. We have been able to give the rising generation mentors and leaders from our own country. Further, WIM winners have been recognised by their organisations nationally and internationally. Today most of the winners have become mentors to young career and business women.”
Dr. Segera added that steered by the advice of Dr Rohantha Athukorala, WIM made the decision to find Sri Lankan women who have excelled in other countries, but have not received any exposure or recognition for their accomplishments. And as a first step, WIM has ventured to confer recognition on Sri Lankan women in Canada.
“We are delighted to say that we received nearly 50 applications for the first round of WIM Awards to be held in Canada. We were so proud to read their profiles and it was a privilege for the panel of judges to read how the applicants have excelled in their fields on the international platform.”
Subsequent to the selection by the panel of judges, WIM will bestow recognition on 20 women at the Top 20 WIM Canada Awards that will be held on January 20, 2018 in Toronto, Canada.
This event will be graced by the High Commissioner for Sri Lanka in Canada along with the Consulate General of Sri Lanka and other diplomats from Sri Lanka and Canada.
This event is co-ordinated by Rienzie Martinesz, Official Representative for WIM Awards Canada. WIM Canada Awards is partnered by Cinnamon Life (member of the John Keells Group) as the Platinum Sponsor, Singer Sri Lanka, Jetwing Hotels and Travels and Indian Ocean Rim Association (IORA). The panel of judges are Dr Rohantha Athukorala, Dawn Austin, Kumar Samarasinghe, Kasturi Wilson, Gowri Rajan and Jeevan Thiyagarja.
