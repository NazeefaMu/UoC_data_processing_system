The first woman Mayor of Colombo, Rosy Senanayake assumed duties at the mayoral office at Town Hall yesterday. Ministers Sujeewa Senasinghe and Gayantha Karunathilake and Parliamentarian Ravi Karunanayake were among the distinguished invitees at the event.
“One-third of the citizens in Colombo are low-income earners and live in shanties. We are ready to provide 50,000 houses during the next 10 years. Plans to establish educational centrs, vocational training institutions, clinical services, and waste management with dengue prevention will be executed immediately, said the newly-appointed mayor.
“The Colombo Municipal Council has all the manpower and resources to develop this city. I am willing to give the required leadership with dedication and commitment and fulfil the promises we made to the citizens. We have to provide a hassle-free service to our taxpayers without exhausting them of their precious time,” Senanayake said.
Mohammed Iqbal assumed duties as the Deputy Mayor. “We must provide a quick service to the poor and every community should get together and help the mayor if we are to develop this great city,” he said.
Senanayake previously acted as the Sri Lanka's High Commissioner for Malaysia and the Deputy Minister of Women and Child Affairs.
“We are ready to make Colombo the best city in South Asia,” she said. “We should forget our failures and work together to develop Colombo in a peaceful environment where everyone would respect each other and their communities.”
