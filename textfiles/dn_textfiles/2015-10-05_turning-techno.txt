TURNING TECHNO

Mention Sri Lankan music and her name automatically crops up. Her inimitable deep voice opened a new chapter in Sri Lankan music history and reached far beyond local horizons, as far as to win international aesthetic appeal.
“If I were 21 years old today my main aim would be to learn some of the features related to the modern technology. Many people have mentioned that my songs have been featured in the internet: on youtube, a blog, facebook, twitter etc. I know nothing about them today. Therefore I am sure I would be eager to learn about these features and include them in my lifestyle,” says the dame with a sonorous voice who has entertained masses with her evergreen songs.
At 70, Nanda Malini says that though she does not know the first thing about such technological devices, she believes that she has not missed out much, music vise.
“I am very satisfied with my songs. The modern technology could not have made them better. It was the golden age of music when I was in my early 20s. Even if I was 21 today I am sure I would have used the modern resources to gift something worthwhile to the country,” she said.
She notes that though new genres of music like r&b, hip hop and reggae had entered the scene her heart would still lie in light classical music.
“Though I would be 49 years younger, I am sure that my tastes would not have changed. You cannot change your preferences because they are innate qualities. Sure, I would enjoy listening to other musicians displaying their talents but I would stick by my own style,” she added. Apart from music she has a passion for travelling. She says that she would like to travel far and wide but mainly to Asian countries like India and Myanmar.

“My dream is to visit Borobudur, Indonesia. I feel that we can relate to these countries because our cultures are alike. We feel a sense of belonging even if we visit a kovil or temple in these countries. I love that homely atmosphere,” she said. Queried if she would ever migrate to another land Nanda said that such a though would never cross her mind.
“A visit is ok but I do not feel like settling down in another country. Sri Lanka is home. I belong here,” she added firmly
She enjoys traveling to Anuradhapura to look at the ruins. Therefore more visits to the ancient city will be on the cards. She would also like to visit Jaffna and see the situation there with her own eyes.
She says that she will spend more time reading books and newspapers as well as watching dramas.
“However I would never pursue acting. Though I have my own political ideologies, a political career is not for me,” she mused.
Many young girls in their 20s show interest towards fashion and make up these days. Nanda too believes that she would try to educate herself about the subject.
“My style is simplicity. Therefore whatever I do to beautify myself, I would not go to the extreme. I like to lead a simple lifestyle. Though I have visited many countries I do not like to bring back a lot of items from them. I like to keep my home less crowded as possible. I have never purchased items apart from a CD or any small items which have to do with my music. I have never brought back suitcases filled with stuff,” she revealed.
For many young girls 21 spells the age ripe for romance. Nanda believes that she too will be ready to give it as shot if she encountered the person of her choice.
“Many girls marry at 25 years these days. There is no reason to delay that chapter in your life if the right person comes along,” she said.
She has seen some youths who possess qualities she would have had if she was around their age.
“They are keen on meritorious activities. If they see an old man trying to cross the road they do not hesitate to help him. I believe that I could have been included in that crowd because I too like to help the less privileged,” she concluded with a smile.
