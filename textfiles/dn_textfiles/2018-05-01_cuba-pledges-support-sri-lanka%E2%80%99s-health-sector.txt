Cuba pledges support Sri Lanka’s health sector

 
The Cuban Government pledged extended its fullest support to develop the Sri Lankan health sector, Health Ministry spokesman said today.
The Cuban public Health Minister Roberto Morales Ojeda pledged to support Sri Lanka in a meeting held with Health Minister Rajitha Senaratne at the International Convention "Cuba Salud 2018" held in Havana Convention Center, Cuba, recently.
During the discussions held between the two Ministers it was agreed to sign an agreement in connection with obtaining drugs and medical equipment manufactured in Cuba to Sri Lanka through the State Pharmaceuticals Corporation (SPC), he said.
More rounds of discussions will be held between Sri Lankan and Cuban health authorities before signing the agreement, he added.
