Hair and how!

People often keep memoirs to honour loved ones who have passed away. One woman wanted to honour her mother’s life and decided to keep an unusual memento; she decided to keep locks of her deceased mother’s hair. And now she needs help from someone who’s willing to make a dress out of it.
The 61-year-old, from Bristol, has launched an appeal to find a factory capable of creating the dress. The woman, who wants to remain unnamed, says she’d been collecting her mother’s hair for four years before she died, and has set aside around £15,000 for the dress to be made.
The woman posted the request on fashion manufacturing marketplace Sewport last week, but due to the unusual nature of her request, has been unable to find a manufacturer or seamstress to work with her.
She’d been collecting the hair since her mum fell ill in 2014 and didn’t initially know what to do with it until recently.
The request states that the manufacturer who takes the job will need to recreate the ballroom-style dress, with the sleeves, neckline, bottom trim and bodice decorated with the hair.
She would like the dress to be as ‘authentic’ as possible and has sketched out what she would like it to look like.
The daughter has said that £15,000 has been put aside for the creation of the dress, as she knows it’s ‘weird’. She would like the dress completed before next August – one year on from her mother’s death.
It states that she wants the outfit to replicate her mother’s wedding dress from 1953 and also stated that she has ‘one full box’ of hair, which she hopes will be enough.
“Obviously it’s not every day we get requests like this through, and despite having more than 500 manufacturers on site, no one’s shown any interest in carrying out the work yet,” said Boris Hodakel, Sewport founder.
“The lady, who has asked to remain anonymous, is just looking for someone to help her create a final memento of her mother. Our goal is to give everyone, from professional designers to students, the chance to create exactly what they have envisioned – even if it is a dress made of hair.”
