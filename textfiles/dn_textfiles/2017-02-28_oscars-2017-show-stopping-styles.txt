Oscars 2017 : show-stopping styles

Hollywood’s elite attended the 2017 Academy Awards at Los Angeles’ Dolby Theatre on Sunday night, turning heads as they made their way down the red carpet. Unsurprisingly, the industry’s leading ladies stole the show with their sophisticated ensembles.
Gowns with plunging necklines and thigh-high slits, style staples on various red carpets during the 2017 awards show season, were the hottest looks of the night.
Red carpet pros Nicole Kidman, Charlize Theron and Emma Stone didn’t disappoint with show-stopping styles that will surely be remembered years from now.
Kidman showed off her slim figure in an nude ensemble with subtle embroidery, while Stone opted for a fringed number of a similar light hue. Theron made quite an entrance in a metallic black gown with a deep-V neckline.
Of course, “Hidden Figures” star Taraji P. Henson slayed in a blue velvet Alberto Ferretti gown with a sophisticated thigh-high slit. She looked absolutely stunning! E News
