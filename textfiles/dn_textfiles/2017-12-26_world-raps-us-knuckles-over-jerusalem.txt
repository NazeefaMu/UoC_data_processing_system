How much will the Earth get warmer next year?
World raps U.S. knuckles over Jerusalem

In the United Nations last week the world community dealt a recalcitrant and boastful American President a sharp rap on the knuckles for his move on Jerusalem. But as 2017 draws to a close, humanity must look back, first and foremost, at the pace of global warming and climate change. How much closer are we to losing our living environment on Earth? How much have the oceans risen in 2017 and how much more will sea waters encroach on land in the new year?
Even though the President of the United States of America refuses to “believe” in global warming, the world’s premier space agency, namely, America’s own National Aeronautics & Space Administration (NASA) has tons of information on the phenomenon of ‘climate change’ and its growing impact on human civilisation. NASA’s climate change monitoring website – full of easily understood graphics – reveals that due to global warming and the resulting melting of ice across the planet, the world’s oceans are now steadily rising.
In the last century, according to NASA, sea levels have arisen 8 inches. Following the recent faster rise in global temperatures, ocean water will encroach on land by at least 3 feet more during the rest of this century. This may not seem much living on a big island like Sri Lanka, but think of what is happening to The Maldive Islands.
Very little of The Maldives’ 1,200-plus chain of tiny islands is three feet above sea level. Thus, with Indian Ocean water levels rising, The Maldives literally faces extinction over the next century. Will Sri Lanka have to accommodate the 200,000-plus Maldivian population once it is displaced by rising ocean levels? Questions such as these truly drive home the seriousness of the issue of global climate change.
Oceanic encroachment
Numerous small islands and archipelagos, such as the tiny Pacific islands of Nauru and Micronesia, are already experiencing this ocean encroachment and face displacement in the next few decades.
Our low-lying coastal areas too will experience this oceanic encroachment on our living space. Tens of millions of people in the large low-lying coastal areas of Bangladesh and other parts of South Asia face displacement due to the gradual encroachment of ocean waters. Bangladesh is already very crowded. When sea water encroaches, where will the displaced population find living space in the even smaller and yet reducing land area? Across the world, hundreds of millions of people face displacement and loss of livelihood as ocean waters encroach on land over the next several decades.
The passing of years is becoming a kind of countdown to humanity’s displacement from the Earth’s land surface. And global warming is accompanied by other, already catastrophic, symptoms of climate change: massive swings in weather patterns disrupting agriculture, desertification and, freak storms becoming the norm and not the exception.
Meanwhile, climate crisis notwithstanding, US President Donald Trump continues to indulge in all kinds of political histrionics both domestic and international. While some of his histrionics are mere individual foibles – enacted in damaging real politik – other actions are done in coordination with his governing Republican Party.
Donald Trump may, on his own, indulge in gimmicks like some controversial public statements – often shockingly racist or sexist Tweets. These are often for the purpose of diverting attention from the on-going criminal investigations into Russian cyber subversion and Trump’s own possible complicity with some of that subversion, specifically, possible clandestine collaboration with the Russians to tilt last year’s presidential election in his favour. Another motive for such pseudo-drama is to keep entertained Trump’s immediate political constituency, mainly White American, lowbrow, working class segments especially in the poorer mid-western and eastern states.
At the same time, possible collusion with America’s old enemy and continuing rival power Russia, notwithstanding, the ruling Republican Party collaborates with their President in attempting to achieve their own political agenda.
Right now, mid-term elections for the House of Representatives and the Senate that are to be held next November are high on the Republican agenda. Hence, when President Trump opted to announce the US’ recognition of Jerusalem as the official capital of Israel, the Republican Party went along with their President even though the veteran party leaders knew, from governing experience itself, that this diplomatic recognition was not only a violation of international law and current United Nations’ resolutions, but also an undermining of the US’ long-held role as peace-maker in the Palestinian-Israeli conflict.
The sole reason why all those seasoned politicians of the Republican Party have gone along with Donald Trump’s Jerusalem gimmick is domestic vote bank politics. The Republicans know that the Jerusalem move appeals to the Right-wing, Christian conservative voters most of whom are with the Republican Party.
With little legislative achievement to show in the first year of the Trump presidency other than the recently passed sweeping tax reforms, the Republicans need to have such populist actions like the Jerusalem recognition to retain their conservative Christian vote banks.
Many intellectuals in American across the political spectrum are amazed as to the lengths the current Republican Party leadership seems prepared to go in risking the undermining of America’s standing in the world as well as further de-stabilising the precarious West Asian situation - just for the purpose of short term electoral gains.
The Jerusalem announcement has estranged America from much of the world community, including its closest allies.
UN Security Council’s emergency session
First, the UN Security Council convened in emergency session and the US suffered a condemnatory resolution which was only avoided by the US Ambassador casting a veto.
If the Security Council vote exposed the isolation of America, the subsequent UN General Assembly sitting, also convened urgently, showed the degree of hostility that the Jerusalem move has brought to the country once upheld as a beacon of civilised democracy and human decency.
In the General Assembly session, a similar condemnatory resolution was passed with 128 countries – including Sri Lanka - in favour, just 9 against (including the US and Israel) and 35 abstentions. A few country delegations stayed away from the UNGA session, probably too scared of the US to vote in favour of the resolution and yet unwilling to embarrass their Arab friends by attending and supporting America.
Many of the world’s poorer nations, including Sri Lanka, who are dependent on American aid and investment to some degree, supported the resolution, braving threats made by Donald Trump himself to cut off aid to those countries that went against the US. US Ambassador Nikki Haley, sounding like a schoolmarm, went around threatening to “take names” of those countries supporting the condemnatory resolution.
She would have had to take the names of the UK, Germany, France and almost all of America’s closest allies who all supported the UNGA resolution which condemned the American action on Jerusalem and declared it null and void.
America’s has gone further down the path to isolationism. The new year will show how much further such trajectory will hold before more thinking people in Washington get their act together to return the world’s most powerful nation on to a more rational path.
What Washington’s current performance clearly shows is that the current anomalies in policy are not simply due to the actions of an incompetent, bigoted individual in the White House. Rather, we are seeing probably the most right-wing, ethnocentric and isolationist Republican leadership tagging along behind that incompetent individual in the White House for the purpose of achieving their ideological goals while they can.
