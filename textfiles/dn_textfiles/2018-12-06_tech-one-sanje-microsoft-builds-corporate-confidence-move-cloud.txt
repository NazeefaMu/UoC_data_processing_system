TECH ONE SANJE, MICROSOFT BUILDS UP CORPORATE CONFIDENCE TO MOVE TO CLOUD

Tech One Sanje and Microsoft introduce the cloud platform to corporations through an event entitled: Move to Cloud with Confidence.
This event aimed to help companies leverage and create co-sell opportunities through positioning Microsoft Azure as a secure cloud platform.
72 participants have gathered composed of IT Solutions Architects, IT Managers, and Senior Technology Practitioners from 21 companies across Sri Lanka to gain insights and learn the opportunities that Microsoft Azure has for the local market.
Ruwan Hewawitharana, Microsoft Sri Lanka Director Sales Corporate Accounts for Sri Lanka and Maldives and one of the speakers of the event, emphasizes the importance of leveraging such cloud technology for the local market. “With a highly unpredictable market that is very receptive to tech trends, having a sturdy cloud platform that speaks flawlessly with newer technology is a must. If it is not Microsoft Azure, I don’t know what it is,” Hewawitharana said.
With the reality that both newer and redefined technologies such as cognitive search and Artificial Intelligence (AI) penetrating the market, Jude Perera, Team Lead for Service Delivery of Tech One Global and one of the speakers of the event, points out that it is not enough just to know these technologies. It is also a must that tech front-liners to be the first users of these technologies tied in with the cloud.
“Apart from being certified experts or be known as knowledgeable as specialists for these technologies, using them is another story, as it is the only avenue we can see how the technology work in full view. And us, having that perspective, should be the first sparker of change and pass it on to future generations,” said Perera.
The presentations were then followed by an open forum to further discuss the potential of Microsoft Azure to the local market.
“Azure’s capabilities transcend the limitations of a typical cloud storage, harnessing every bit of newer technology available in the market, thus, positioning it as a cloud platform addressing almost all types of customer reservations is one way we can leverage it for the local market,” shared Perara to a query about the edge of Microsoft Azure against other cloud service providers.
Tech One Sanje believes that moving to cloud should be a hand-in-hand journey with the experts to attain such confidence to build up digital transformation throughout Sri Lanka. The company promised to organize more events like this to cater the concerns of co-sellers and the industries.
