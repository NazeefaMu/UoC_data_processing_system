The event will be held on Friday, December 8 from 4:30 pm to 6:00 pm at the at LKI.
The keynote address will be delivered by Grace Asirwatham, State Secretary at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Sri Lanka. It will be followed by a panel discussion featuring eminent local experts including Adm. Dr. Jayanath Colombage, former Commander of the Sri Lanka Navy; Shiran Fernando, Chief Economist at the Ceylon Chamber of Commerce; Sumith Nakandala, former Secretary General of BIMSTEC; Dr. Dushni Weerakoon, Executive Director of the Institute of Policy Studies of Sri Lanka.

This event comes at an opportune time as Sri Lanka will take over Chairmanship on the Bay of Bengal Initiative for Multi-Sectoral Technical and Economic Cooperation (BIMSTEC) in 2018.
BIMSTEC is a unique regional bloc as it comprises countries of both South Asia and Southeast Asia, namely, Bangladesh, India, Myanmar, Sri Lanka, Thailand, Nepal and Bhutan. This event aims to (1) understand the potential of BIMSTEC for advancing regional integration in the Bay of Bengal and (2) identify and discuss key steps Sri Lanka could take to harness the potential of BIMSTEC to reduce trade barriers and improve connectivity between member states.
The Global Competitiveness Report 2016-2017 indicates that most countries in South Asia have improved their competitiveness and show positive economic momentum.
Moving forward would require regional integration, which indicates that BIMSTEC could be a foreign policy priority for Sri Lanka.
