Cop copped for sexual offence on cousin

A Police Constable, 48, a father of three serving in a station in Galle, was arrested for allegedly embracing a 17-year-old cousin sister and committing a sexual offence on her, Yakkalamulle Police said.
This follows a complaint made by the girls parents alleging that the constable had visited the house and committed the offence when all other inmates were away. The girl had faced this humiliation while she was preparing for the G.C.E. Ordinary Level examination last December. The constable was due to be produced in court yesterday
