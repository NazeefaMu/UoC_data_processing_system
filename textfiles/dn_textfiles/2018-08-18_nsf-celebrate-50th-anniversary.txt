NSF to celebrate 50th anniversary

The National Science Foundation (NSF) of Sri Lanka will celebrate 50 years of service excellence on October 4.
The NSF engages in the promotion of science, technology and innovation for the economic and social prosperity of the country.
The event will be held under the patronage of President Maithripala Sirisena.
This was revealed at a press conference held under the patronage of Science, Technology, Research, Skills Development and Vocational Training and Kandyan Heritage Minister Dr. Sarath Amunugama.
“Long-established institutions such as the National Science Foundation have ensured throughout the years that Sri Lanka was steadily progressing in the right direction towards a promising future in advancing knowledge and technology,” said Minister Amunugama.
“I congratulate the National Science Foundation on this remarkable milestone and pledge the ministry’s support for their future endeavours in the country’s intellectual and technological development.”
Originally established in 1968 as the National Science Council (NSC), and later succeeded by the Natural Resources Energy and Science Authority (NARESA) in 1981, the institution was re-established as the NSF in 1998 by the Science and Technology Development Act No. 11 of 1994.
