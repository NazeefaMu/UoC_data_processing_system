FITIS Software Chapter to initiate Crowdfunding program

Federation of IT Industry Sri Lanka (FITIS) Software Chapter is planning to initiate a new program on Crowdfunding as a part of its four pillar strategy for the development of the ICT industry and its members, namely business development, capacity creation, policy decisions and training and development.
FITIS Software Chapter has been in operation for 20 plus years, and has been successfully organizing many programs and activities over the years. Crowdfunding will be the biggest initiative of FITIS Software Chapter introduced in 2015. The Crowdfunding concept has attracted immense attention over the past five years. Since Barack Obama’s presidential campaign mobilized millions of small donors to fund his campaign, people have realized the power of Crowdfunding.
Many stories, such as the one of Ouya, a game console developer who raised $950,000 in just eight hours on Kickstarter, have also highlighted the potential of Crowdfunding for creative projects.
Crowdfunding is traditionally viewed as the utilization of websites or platforms to raise funds from a broad pool of potential backers, who are engaged through integrated marketing and social media promotion. Since the Title II provisions of the JOBS Act were legalized in late 2013, there have been dozens of new platforms launched to attract investments by accredited investors.
Crowd Funding (CF) is not appropriate for later stage financing. Although, there are a few examples which show that through Crowdfunding, it was possible to raise large amounts of money even for later-stage projects of incumbent companies, these must be regarded as exceptions.
As most projects are posted on public Crowdfunding platforms before a “proof of concept” has been carried out, it is rare that intellectual property is protected at that point.
By sharing their ideas, projects and concepts online, often at a very early stage of development, those who turn to Crowdfunding run the risk of having a competitor steal their most important resource at that stage: their intellectual property.
The four different types of Crowdfunding methods include: Debt-Based Crowdfunding, Equity-Based Crowdfunding, Reward-based Crowdfunding and Donation-Based Crowdfunding.
The many forms of Crowdfunding, a relatively new and popular avenue for start-up businesses, campaigns, and other organizations looking to promote a business, investment, cause, or other pursuit.
Donation Crowdfunding is exactly what it sounds like - the campaigns amass donations without being required to provide anything of value in return.
