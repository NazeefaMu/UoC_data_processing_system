SLPP candidate arrested  for forging signature

A Sri Lanka Podu Jana Peramuna (Pohottuwa) candidate was arrested by the Morawaka police for allegedly forging the signature of a landowner and tendering an application to the police to obtain a permit to conduct a musical show in his plot of land on January 11.
He is contesting for the Morawaka Pradeshiya Sabha.
He was produced before the Morawaka Magistrate and remanded till January 24, police said.
The SLPP candidate, residing in Waralla, had earlier obtained permission to conduct an election meeting on the said land after tending an application duly signed by the same landowner.
After holding the meeting, he had submitted a second letter with the signature of the landowner seeking a permit to conduct a musical show on the same land. OIC Prabath Deshabandu, who was suspicious about the signature, had summoned the landowner to check the authenticity of his letter.
The landowner had said he had never placed his signature on the sub-segment letter and the candidate had allegedly forged his signature.
