Multiplex unveiled at CCC

Sri Lanka’s first multiplex cinema was opened at the Colombo City Centre (CCC) third floor recently by screening the latest film ‘Johnny English 3’.
Spread over 16,000 square feet, the multiplex cinema comprises 700 seats divided between six screens with 4k projection technology and Dolby Atmos surround sound systems. Here are some of the movie buffs clicked at the opening by our photographer Sarath Peiries.
