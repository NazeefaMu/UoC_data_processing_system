Shanaka, Madushanka provide the fireworks

Dasun Shanaka smashed a superb century – 121 not out off 95 balls with seven sixes and seven fours as Galle routed Colombo by 188 runs in their Super Provincial limited-over match played at CCC grounds yesterday.
Shanaka’s brilliant knock coupled with Dimuth Karunaratne’s innings of 86 saw Galle winning the toss and batting first rattle off an impressive 302-4 in 49 overs.
Lahiru Madushanka     
Colombo in their reply collapsed in a heap to be bowled out for 114 with left-arm spinner Malinda Pushpakumara causing the damage taking five wickets for 29 runs after Suranga Lakmal had initiated the breakthrough with two wickets.
In the other match played at Colts grounds Kandy inspired by a century from skipper Chamara Kapugedera beat Dambulla by 19 runs.
Kapugedera came to his team’s rescue when they had lost half the side for 90 to enable them to end up with a final total of 336-7.
The two partnerships that turned the match was between Kapugedera and Lahiru Madushanka who put on 88 for the seventh wicket and an unbroken stand of 116 for the eighth wicket by Madushanka and Ramith Rambukwella.
Kapugedera hit eight fours and three sixes in his 90-ball knock of 102 and Madushanka slammed a brilliant 90 not out off 62 balls that comprised five sixes and six fours.
Rambukwella provided the innings with a late spurt with a cameo knock of 52 not out off 26 balls that included five sixes and two fours.
Dambulla’s run chase was inspired by Kusal Mendis and Hiran Cooray who put on 114 for the third wicket but they lost wickets regularly and were eventually dismissed for 317 in the 49th over.
Mendis made 77 off 66 balls with three sixes and eight fours and Cooray scored 109 off 119 balls with 10 fours and three sixes.
Dambulla were stalled in their run chase by Lahiru Gamage who struck vital blows taking two wickets in his first spell and a further two more in his final spell to finish with 4 for 46. Danushka Gunathilaka chipped in with three wickets for 23.
The tournament takes a break for the Sinhala and Tamil New Year and resumes on April 22.
