The interest rate will be less than 2%.
Wettasinghe said he has informed President Maithripala Sirisena about this offer and said that he will only offer it to the President. He said that Sri Lanka is facing a major financial crisis and as a patriot he is arranging this loan facility. “I hope more Sri Lankans too would help our motherland this way.”
