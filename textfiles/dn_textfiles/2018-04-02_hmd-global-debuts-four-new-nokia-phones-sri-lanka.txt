HMD Global debuts four new Nokia phones in Sri Lanka

HMD Global, the home of Nokia phones, launched three new additions, Nokia 7 plus, new Nokia 6 and Nokia 1 to its award-winning portfolio of Android smartphones in Sri Lanka.
The legendary Nokia 8110, this 4G feature phone also comes complete with the iconic curved slider design.
Delivering all the craftsmanship the customer expects from a Nokia phone, each new smartphone offers durability and reliability as standard, with the range setting new benchmarks in materials and design.
Furthering its promise to a pure, smart, secure and up-to-date Android experience, HMD Global also announced it is to become the first global partner to have a full suite of devices selected into the Android One programme by Google.
The unwavering commitment to deliver a pure, secure and up-to-date Android experience has ensured Nokia smartphones were a natural fit for the global programme.
James Rutherfoord, VP APAC, HMD Global, said, “This time last year, we started our journey with huge expectations from fans and a massive responsibility to deliver on the legacy of one of the most innovative brands in our space. Since then we have reintroduced well-loved icons, forged partnerships with friends old and new and delivered our pure, secure and up-to-date Android experience across our smartphone portfolio. Last year we shipped over 70 million Nokia phones.
In addition to these stunning new Android smartphones, the iconic Nokia 8110 is reloaded, delivering 4G connectivity, apps including Google Assistant, Google Maps, Google Search, Facebook and Twitter, and the return of the slider phone.
Gayan Wijethilaka, Sri Lanka Head of Marketing of HMD said,“The Nokia brand has experienced a massive resurgence in customer demand since HMD Global scripted the next chapter for Nokia Android phones in 2017.
The new ranges of phones are among the best in each of their classes and offer even more value for money, coupled with the robust and powerful performance customers have known Nokia phones for.”
Two new Nokia smartphones, the Nokia 7 plus and the new Nokia 6– join the Android One family, offering a high quality software experience designed by Google. Each phone will stay fresh over time with the latest AI powered innovations to the highest grade of security from Google. With a pure Android installation, Nokia smartphones come with no unnecessary UI changes or hidden processes that would eat up battery life or slow them down so you can enjoy your new phone for longer. Each of the new phones comes with a limited number of pre-installed apps so that you’ll get more storage space, as well as the latest innovations that help you stay ahead of the game every day.
By shipping with Android Oreo™ out of the box, you’ll be able to enjoy the latest features, including Picture-in-Picture for multitasking, Android Instant Apps to discover and run apps with minimal friction, 60 fantastic new emojis and battery-maximising features like limiting background app use.
