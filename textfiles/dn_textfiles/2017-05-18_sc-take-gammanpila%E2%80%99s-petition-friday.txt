SC to take up Gammanpila’s petition on Friday

A Special Determination petition filed by MP Udaya Gammanpila challenging the “Registration of Electors (Special Provisions) Bill” was fixed for Friday (19) by the Supreme Court yesterday.
The petitioner is seeking a declaration that bill shall become law only through a two-third majority in Parliament and the approval of the people at a referendum.
 The petitioner stated that a bill titled “Registration of Electors (Special Provisions)” was presented to Parliament and placed on the Order Paper on May 3, 2017.
Gammanpila said the long title of the Bill provides it to pass a law to make special provisions to exempt internally displaced persons from certain requirements of the Registration of Elector’s Act, No. 44 of 1980.
