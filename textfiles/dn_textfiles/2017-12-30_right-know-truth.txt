The right to know the truth

Apparently, one study conducted by a social study group has shown that most Lankan people in general, irrespective of nationality are open-minded of learning about the past. In Lanka, all have gone through difficult periods under terror of insurgents and security forces. On the one hand there is a big divide in the knowledge about other communities, even those living in their midst but are from different nationality and religious communities, and even more so when they live in different parts of the country.
There is a strong interest in learning about the other side of the truth which is a special feature of Sri Lanka. They know there is controversy about it and would like to know the truth. This also applies to most members of the security forces. They know they are under a cloud and would like to clear their names.
In the preparation of local government elections these attitudes came into lime light. Everywhere, the parties that accept equality have attracted youth. There are such parties led by Sinhala, Tamil and Muslim political activists. Despite many years of national and inter religious conflicts, most people do not wish to keep hate or have any conflicts with those from other communities.
One of the salient features of the ongoing village political mobilization is that people at the community and political level go out of their way to try and include those of other nationality and religions, in the decision making committees they form. Civil society groups and political activists have found that people today at all levels, and all sectors, including the government bureaucracy, security forces and religious clergy are glad to meet to dialogue and to solve problems together. This is an improvement of social and cultural features of Lanka that represent the modernization of the society.
Racism and fascistic agitation
The Joint Opposition has re-started to spouse racism and fascistic agitation. As usual Premier Ranil Wickremesinghe will avoid confrontation at this time too, for reasons of electoral politics. Some hope that after the conclusion of the local government elections on February 10 a new window of opportunity will open for reconciliation. Victory of radical democracy may compel the government to carry out the promises made to the people. Delivering on its promise of ascertaining and clarifying the truth needs to be a priority.
After a long delay local elections are scheduled on February 10, 2018. According to the officials nearly 16 million persons will be voting at these elections. No doubt this will be the largest election in Lankan history. Luckily elections are held under the new system. The ‘manape’ misery has been removed and these will also be the first elections under the mixed electoral system whereby 60% of members will be elected using first-past-the-post voting and the remaining 40% through closed list proportional representation.
However, as usual the turnover could be less than 70% and official anticipation is that the turnout of the electorate will be much less than previous ones. The last local government elections held in 2011 saw a voter turnout of 65 percent. However this time around the figure cannot be much less, looking at the political debates taking place. There is a stronger degree of voter attachment with the radical political parties.
Local government elections
In Lanka local government has a history which goes into the beginning of civilization. The name Gemunu originates from village authority and refers to the village leader or the chairman of the village council.
The Elara, Gemunu conflict was based on the powers of the central government and the village council in the periphery. In reality it was a socio-economic conflict between two systems. Elara stood for strong village authority that controls the village tank and water management. Gemunu stood for Asiatic state based on organised water management. Power of the village council is weak in relation to the central government. Buddhism backed the centralization of power with an organised clergy or Sangha. Later village culture reemerged as the centralized irrigations broke down and it continued under the colonial powers. British recognized the power of village council and they revived it with the support of local aristocratic authority while getting their support to the central colonial administration.
Today the local government elections are most important to the village and ward level political activist. In fact it was claimed that the 1971 insurrection indirect protest against postponement of local government elections. Therefore, the issues at local elections are usually not local ones, but national issues which are of more interest to the voters. This election will be no exception. The opposition in particular has been trying to induce voters to see the forthcoming local government elections as being of national significance. In particular the defeated fascistic political movement is raising the ‘division of the country’ issue as the main item in the political debate.
New constitution
Former President Mahinda Rajapaksa, who is heading the so-called Joint Opposition campaign has clearly stated that this election will not be about local issues but whether the people want to support or oppose the government and proposed new constitution. Also he makes the accusation that the government has not delivered on its promises to welfare of the masses.
At these elections, the parties forming the government will be disadvantaged by the slowness of their performance in delivering on the promises made at the national elections that took place in 2015. The voter turnout at the last general elections in 2015 at which change for the better was the promise, was 78 percent.
The government’s main campaign promises in addition to resolving the Tamil national problem and improving human rights conditions, were with regard to quick results in economic betterment for the masses and to meting out justice to those accused of large scale corruption.
These promises galvanized the electorate. Some say that the irony in this campaign is to see the hunter becoming the hunted. Those accused of large scale corruption in the former government have sought to become hunters. However the fascistic forces are well exposed.That has forced Mahinda Rajapaksa to go slow at the beginning; but he has nothing to deliver except brutal racist clashes.
