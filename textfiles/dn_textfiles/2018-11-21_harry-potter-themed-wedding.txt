Harry Potter themed wedding

A pair of Harry Potter fans decided to use their love of magic to inspire their wedding day. Niamah Haddow and Michael Sidwell decided on a Harry Potter themed wedding, which included bridesmaids holding broomsticks instead of bouquets, and the groom wearing a Gryffindor tie.
They even had a real owl, and walked down an aisle made out of pages of their favourite Harry Potter books. Niamah, who is originally from Wales but now lives in Australia, said, “The whole day was like stepping into Universal Studios, it was like we were in our own world. Everything was Harry Potter. We had pages of the book down the aisle and signs directing people to places in the Potter world. My ring holder was the half blood prince book on the ‘unbreakable vow’ page. My bridesmaids had broomsticks as their bouquet and my bouquet was made out the book pages as were the groomsmen’s flowers in their pockets. Michael’s tie was also a Gryffindor bow.”
The couple, who met five years ago at Worcester University, even sprinkled magic into their vows and music.
Niamah, 24, said, “Our vows were all Harry Potter related as was our music. I had a platform 9 and 3/4 wall and had letters inside. There were signs in the girls and boys bathroom saying ‘troll’, ‘Moaning Myrtle’ and ‘Ministry of Magic this way’ I had signs everywhere.”
The couple paid homage to Hogwarts with floating candles, which fill the Great Hall in the school for wizards.
Niamah added, “Each wedding table was a different subject at Hogwarts, I had floating candles, I had a cake which was all Harry Potter and a sweet cart that was Honey Dukes. We even had a real owl.”
Police Officer Niamah said she and Michael, 26, had expressed their love of all things Potter the moment they met.
She said, “Because of our ages we have always grown up with it. When we first met we expressed our love for it and our first proper date ended up being at the Harry Potter studios in Watford. We got engaged on the bridge of Stratford upon Avon, it’s a magical place with lots of Harry Potter and witch related things all around.”
The couple wed on October 13 at the Bridge Water Mill in Adelaide, which Niamah said reminded them of ‘the Weasley house’ And their own house is just as Potter friendly. Niamah said: ‘Our whole house is Harry Potter themed. “All our pets were named after Harry Potter characters, our dog is called Albus and we had a cat called Dobby.” The super fans said their loved ones, who know of their J.K Rowling obsession, were a bit taken aback by their themed day.
Niamah added, “We had a moment before everyone walked into the reception room where nobody had seen the decoration. And it was just Michael and I and we practised our first dance, and for that moment it was just taking in the day. I think when everyone saw the decorations they knew it was coming because they know how we are both big fans! But I think we went above and beyond I don’t think they ever expected it to be this much!”
