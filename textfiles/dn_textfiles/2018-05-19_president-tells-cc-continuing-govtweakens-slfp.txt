President tells CC: continuing in Govt.weakens SLFP

President Maithripala Sirisena told the SLFP Central Committee (CC) to fix the date as to when the SLFP will quit the Government, SLFP Opposition MP Dayasiri Jayasekara said.
Addressing a press conference at the ‘Centre of Media for the Freedom’ in Punchi Borella yesterday, Jayasekara said the President told the CC that continuing in the Government any longer would only result in the weakening of the SLFP and further distancing itself from the people.
“The President asked the CC to take a correct decision. The SLFP members in the Government are also holding discussions in this regard. Our group of 16 in the Opposition has stressed that the SLFP should leave the Government, and the SLFP members who want to remain in the Government can do so individually,” he said.
MP Lakshman Yapa Abeywardena said the President told the CC that remaining in the Government would only ruin the SLFP’s future.
He however stressed that the President made these comments at the CC as the SLFP Chairman and not as the Head of State.
“As the Head of State he has to rule the country. But he made those remarks as our party leader,”Abeywardena he said.
Former Minister Jayasekara further said a new set of office bearers will be appointed to the SLFP for an interim period at a special SLFP Central Committee (CC) meeting on June 3.
He said the CC, Executive Committee and the All Island Committee will meet on June 3 to agree on a “complete restructure” of the party.
“The President obtained in writing the views of the Group of 16 in the Opposition and the Group of 23 in the Government, and he combined them and presented to the CC. Far-reaching party reforms will be presented to District level committees on June 9-10, and village level committees on June 14-15.
The process will be completed by August 26 and the President will announce the permanent office bearers of the party at the SLFP Convention on September 2. He will also brief the party’s programme to come back to power,” he added.
