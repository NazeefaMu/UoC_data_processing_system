Musicians rich list

Adele is the richest musician under 30, according to the new edition of The Sunday Times Rich List, to be published this Sunday, May 7. The 160-page special edition of The Sunday Times Magazine reveals the wealth of the 1,000 richest people in the UK.
Adele, 29, who also appears in the main Rich List for the first time this year, having first appeared in The Sunday Times Young Rich List in 2011, is now worth a cool £125m. Having increased her fortune by almost 50% – £40m – in the past year alone, she is the joint 19th richest musician in the Music Rich List.
Adele, 29, followed her phenomenally successful 2015 album 25 with an ongoing 122 date world tour, taking around £138m at the box office. Her main company’s financial statements show profits of almost £20m in 2015 and hold assets of £13m. In February, Adele won five Grammy Awards, taking her to 15 in total. Brian May, the lead guitarist with Queen, shares 19th place on the Music Rich List with Adele, valued at £125m.
At 160 pages this year’s Sunday Times Rich List - the 29th annual edition to be produced - is the biggest ever. The definitive guide to wealth charts the fortunes of the 1,000 richest individuals and families in the British Isles.
Robert Watts, the Compiler of The Sunday Times Rich List 2017, said: “What a year for Adele. Such strong record sales and a busy touring schedule propel her into our main list for the first time. Still in her 20s, if Adele’s career lasts as long as many of the other entries in our list, she has the potential to be the highest-earning British musician of all time.
“The rises we have seen from the Rolling Stones and other older bands are very striking. Many of these groups continue to play lucrative gigs well-into their 70s - with their wealthier fans prepared to stump up more for their tickets than younger fans of new acts.
“It seems rock music - be it performing or watching - is no longer just for the young.” Music News
