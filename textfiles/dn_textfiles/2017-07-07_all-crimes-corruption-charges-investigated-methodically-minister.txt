All crimes, corruption charges investigated methodically - Minister

Whether it is a small crime or large; a crime is a crime and they all have to be investigated properly, Law and Order and Southern Development Minister Sagala Ratnayake said yesterday. Responding to allegations that police were inactive when tackling large scale corruption in the country, the minister said he respected the rule of law in the country and that he did not interfere with any of the law and order agencies.
“This is what the government expects and they are allowed to function independently. But in Cabinet we did agree that there needed to be a better mechanism to follow up on these cases”, Minister Ratnayake told the media at Temple Trees yesterday.
Cabinet co-spokesperson, Rajith Senaratne addressing the weekly Cabinet briefing on Wednesday said President Maithripala Sirisena had informed Cabinet that he was disappointed with the progress made by the FCID when investigating cases of large scale corruption and that all thieves would be caught within six months if it was under his purview. The President had added that the FCID only seems to be investigating small crimes while letting the larger crimes slip.
“The Cabinet is appointed by the President together with the Prime Minister and it is up to them to change it as they wish. I do not claim any right to this Ministry.I will fulfil whatever responsibility given to me. I am hundred percent certain that I have fulfilled my responsibilities to the best of my abilities and even if I am given another portfolio, I will do my best there. I value my dignity above all”,the minister said.
Inspector General Pujith Jayasundera said there are certain things that cannot be revealed when conducting investigations and we cannot reveal details until cases are filed in courts. As the IGP, I can state with responsibility that the relevant investigations are being done according to the law in a methodical way and in an impartial manner”, the IGP said.
