Navy rescues six drowning Indian fishermen

Six Indian fishermen, who were seen drowning in the Sri Lankan territorial waters, were rescued by officers and sailors of Sri Lanka Navy’s Fast Gun Boat on patrol, attached to the Northern Naval Command on Wednesday.
The Fast Gun Boat (FGB) which was on patrol in the Sri Lankan territorial waters, had observed the drowning fishermen in the seas 15 nautical miles off Kovillan Point light house. The officers and sailors onboard promptly reacted to rescue them. Accordingly, the six fishermen were saved.
Later, the rescued group was handed over to a Fast Attack Craft on patrol and they were safely brought to SLNS Uttara at Kankesanthurai.
After providing basic first aid and medicine, the group was handed over to KKS Police for further investigations.
