BBDO Lanka wins Agency of the Year  at Campaign Asia-Pacific awards

BBDO Lanka was recognised as one of the most creative agencies in the region at the Campaign Asia-Pacific Agency of the Year 2018 awards, marking the end of another year of spectacular awards success.
BBDO Lanka was awarded the ‘Rest of South Asia Creative Agency of the Year - Bronze’ award by Campaign Asia-Pacific at its gala awards presentation for the South Asian region held at Taj Lands End, Mumbai, India last night (4 December).
This marks the fourth occasion that BBDO Lanka has entered the highly rigorous and eminent competition and been awarded a Rest of South Asia Creative Agency of the Year award. It took home the Gold in 2017, Silver in 2012 and Bronze in 2015.
BBDO Lanka Senior Account Director, Chanithi Gunasekera said, “This is our fourth win and we are all very excited to be part of a team that drives excellence in creativity and effectiveness across all the mediums and brands we work on. And of course it’s always great to end the year on a high that motivates us to do even better in the coming year.”
Celebrating its twenty-fifth year, Campaign Asia-Pacific Agency of the Year awards celebrate the people, the work and the organisations achieving exceptional success in the highly exciting and fastest-growing media, marketing and advertising markets in the world.
The awards highlight worthy leadership, creativity and innovation, outstanding business performance, development of talent and contribution to the industry.
Campaign ensures the Agency of the Year awards continue to maintain its reputation for integrity and credibility by creating stringent entry criteria, enlisting a decidedly respected judging panel comprised of prominent senior marketers from key business categories as well as Campaign editors, and independent auditing, with the results tabulated by PricewaterhouseCoopers.
This year Campaign further elevated the standards of entry criteria by introducing compulsory management endorsement, further validating the accuracy of each entry submission, and providing judges the right to raise queries regarding any information submitted. Changes were also introduced to the methodology of how business growth is stated to increase transparency further.
BBDO Lanka MD, Santosh Menon said, “Last December we celebrated being the only Sri Lankan agency to win at Tangrams Effectiveness Awards in Singapore while also winning at Effie Awards Sri Lanka and Campaign Asia-Pacific’s Agency of the Year awards. This year too we are delighted to win big at Spikes Asia, Effie Awards Sri Lanka and now at the Agency of the Year awards.”
“It demonstrates our consistent effort at delivering highly creative work for our clients, year after year. It is always wonderful when this work is entered into international competitions and wins us recognition. It shows that we follow a high quality process that delivers globally recognised creative outputs for our clients, year after year. All credit to our team in Sri Lanka who has achieved these accolades.”
