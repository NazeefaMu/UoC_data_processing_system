Heart, the only book

Quite a number of terms have been handed down the centuries, depicting the visionary views of people who matter. Among them, the religious communicators have played a vital role in moulding the society at large for a better state of living. ‘Fables’, ‘parables’, ‘similes’, ‘sayings’, ‘anecdotes’ are a few terms that are used to denote the quality of the views presented. The lay and clergy pupils of great teachers have devoted more time to collect the sayings of their teachers, as a devotion to the memorable teachings.
One of the pupils of Ajahn Chah, named Thanissaro Bhikkhu, has devoted most of the time collecting and compiling the 108 Dhamma similes translated from Thai into English titled as ‘It’s Like This’. The compilation comes as a publication of the Abhayagiri Monastery Foundation printed for free distribution in 2013. According to Thanissaro Bhikkhu, Ajahn Chah was a master at using the apt and unusual simile to explain points of Dhamma in a memorable way, sometimes to answer questions, something to provoke them.
Packed with creativity
He was talented at explaining and exploiting the open-ended nature to the simile, in which some similarities are relevant and others are not. He uses a particular image to make one point in one context, and a very different point in another. As a reader of these 108 similes, I found some of them quite creative and packed with an inner vision.
I wish to quote one such example.
“Whether we are happy or sad, feel pleasure or pain, cry or sing, as long as we are in the world, these things happen in a cage. We don’t escape from the cage. Even if we are wealthy, we are in a cage. If we are poor, we are in a cage. If we cry we are in a cage. If we dance, we dance in a cage. What is the cage? It is the case of birth, ageing, illness and death.”
From here onwards the simile is extended in the following words.
“It is like a mourning dove we keep in our home. We simply listen to its song, and we praise it. How do we praise?”
“How pretty, the sound of my dove! My dove has a low voice. My dove has a high voice. That’s how we praise the dove. Btu we never ask our dove if it’s enjoying itself or not. We give it rice to eat and water to drink, but everything is in the cage. And yet we see and feel that the dove is satisfied.”
Gathering stress
Then the simile rises to a point of illumination in the following manner, when Ajahn Chah raises a question and tries to respond to it.
“Have we ever stopped to think? If someone gives us rice and water and put us in a cage, would we be happy? In the same way, we are caged in the world. But do we really know our condition? Actually we are gathering stress and suffering into ourselves, because we don’t look into the dove at the cage.
It looks as if the dove is living comfortably. We feel that it can eat rice and drink water and we feel then the dove lives happily. The condition is compared to the living condition of ourselves. We live in a cage.
Ajahn Chah concludes in the following words.
“Even though we live in extreme pleasure and comfort, once we are born, we will then have to grow old. When we are old we will then have to grow sick. We will then have to die. This is suffering. This is the way we suffer.”
Inner turmoil
The simile titled as ‘In the Cage’ looks like a mini parable applicable for all times. The study of similes may lead one to the understanding of the inner turmoil of human existence. In turn, the simile and the parable may lead to the creation of fables, now rediscovered as a new form of narrative.
Ajahn Chah utilises other forms of similes too. On ‘the flattering of mind’, he says: “Stillness of mind without discernment is like a leaf that flutters when stirred by a breeze.” In other words, the stillness of mind, without discernment is dark and then brought back and forth. It is like a person who eats meat and gets a piece stuck in his teeth when he pulls it out he feels better. But when he is hungry, he eats more and get another stuck in teeth. It hurts him again. But again and again, he pulls it out and feels happy.”
There is pain. Then the pain is relieved. IT brings happiness for a moment. The condition of the mind is nothing but a fluttering one. The mind is made to flutter over and over again. The reader enters into a world of vision. Like in there are questions raised by the king and responded by Venerable Nagasena Thera.
State of the mind
Take for example the simile of the ‘One Mango Explained’. It goes as follows.
A question is raised.
This mango is first small, then it’s half ripe. Is it the same mango as the small one? When it comes out as a flower, it’s the mango. When it is small, it is the mango. When it is big, it is the same mango. When it is half ripe, it is the same mango. When it’s ripe, it is the same mango.”
The explanation is as follows as applicable to the state of the mind.
“The same with virtue, concentration and discernment; virtue in simple terms is abandoning evil, a person without virtue is hot. If he abandons evil, he cools down, for he has no guilt. That lack of quilt is the reward of virtue. It makes the mind peaceful. The mind gets concentrated.”
When the mind is concentrated, Ajahn says:
“It is clear and clean. You can see lots of things in it. It’s like the water with no ripples. If you look into it, you see not only the reflection of your face. You can see all the way to the roof above you. When birds fly past, you can see them too.”
The climax of this vision goes as follows.
“So these things are all the same thing. Like the one mango!”
In many ways, I felt that I am rediscovering a series of new creative communication technique in the teaching of Dhamma, without using the high-flown technique.
