Monsoon rains begin in Anuradhapura
Plans afoot to cultivate over 130,000 hectares

The long-awaited monsoonal rain season has begun in the Anuradhapura district. Anuradhapura Government Agent R. M. Wanninayaka told the Daily News that if the major tanks receives rain up to spilling level, it has been planned to cultivate 129,000 hectares with paddy during the 2017/2018 Maha Cultivation Season.
He further said that depending on an adequate rainfall, it is envisaged to get a paddy harvest of 830,000 MT during the current Maha Season and 2018 Yala Season in the Anuradhapura district.
"Around 140,000 farmer families in the district have had heavy cultivation losses during the last three consecutive cultivation seasons.
We are making arrangements to provide every possible support for them to cultivate the full acreage in view of the untold hardships they have been undergoing.
Especially nearly 500,000 bushels of seed paddy would be distributed on a 50 percent subsidized basis, or where necessary, free-of-charge. Also Agrarian Services Department and the Fertilizer Secretariat officials have been instructed to look into ensuring that there are adequate fertilizer stocks available in the open market, while fertilizer subsidy monies are paid in time to the farmers.
It was learnt that around 150,000 farmers have applied for the subsidy," Wanninayaka said.
Referring to the fertilizer subsidy issue, Kachcheri Fertilizer Secretariat Assistant Director Ajith Kumara said that an estimated sum of Rs. 30,00 million required to pay the fertilizer subsidy to the farmers during 2017/2018 Maha Cultivation Season.
He further said that there were sufficient TSP, Urea and MOP fertilzier stocks available in the open fertilizer market in the district.
Farmers used to apply fertilizer to their cultivation beyond the prescribed doses in the past, where solid fertilizer subsidy were offered, with the intention of yielding enhanced harvest. This practice has made the soil infertile and poisonous and as such, farmers are instructed to use fertilizer adhering to the leaf colour chart criteria.
It has been found through recent soil tests that in some paddy cultivation zones, TSP and Urea percentages are high and that soil shall not be introduced to more chemical fertilizer.
Farmers are advised to practice soil testing with the aid of Agriculture Research and Production Assistants to guide them. Such a procedure would minimize the expenditure for fertilizer and help to revive the fertility of the soil, he added.
He said that the maximum selling price of 50 kg of fertilizer is Rs. 2,500.
He appealed to the farmers to complain to the government agent, the divisional secretaries and the fertilizer secretariat officials in case of any fertilizer shortage, alleged hoarding of fertilizer, or selling of them at exorbitant prices by the traders.
