Puttalam paddy lands abandoned in Maha season

Less than 50 percent of paddy lands in the Puttalam district have been brought under the plough during the Maha season this year. The farmers received irrigated water from tanks fed by Deduru Oya, Puttlam District Government Agent N.H.M. Chitrananda said.
He said that dwindling of seasonal paddy cultivation was due to the long spell of drought experienced during December last year with nearly 1347 tanks and irrigation systems receiving a meagre supply of water.
