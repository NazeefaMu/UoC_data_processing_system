JKOA inks deal with SAP Hybris customer support module

 A leader in office automation and a fully-owned subsidiary of John Keells Holdings, John Keells Office Automation (JKOA) recently penned an agreement with SAP Hybris to integrate an innovative product in to their customer service spectrum targeted at enhancing customer experience.
The SAP Hybris Customer Support Module which will be launched shortly has been recognized globally for its functionality, user-friendliness and reporting mechanisms.
The modern technologically advanced customer is constantly on the lookout for products and services that are value for money and allows them more control over areas such as after-sales service. With the introduction of the new customer portal JKOA will open up its customer support operations to the end user who then has the ability to engage real time with the service they require and the response from the seller. To make this possible the system will include an automated breakdown assignment option, on-field estimates, repair tracking systems and social media integration.
The comprehensive self-service system improves customer satisfaction and reduces support cost by giving the customer the right tools to manage their requests, whilst allowing customers to check the status of repair, other information enabling visibility and thereby removing the dependency on a call centre. It also enables the service provider to extend services from anywhere and bringing them closer to the customer. The system tracks availability of field engineers based on territory and assigns the closest to the customer site thereby reducing travel time.In a fast-paced world this is an optimum requirement which will enable field engineers to repair and close the job onsite further reducing down time for customers.Automated billing makes sure that the job is completed in record time.
Speaking on the introduction of the new system Janoda Thoradeniya, CEO JKOA noted, “For years JKOA has been recognized for superior products and quality after-sales service. The introduction of the SAP Hybris system will further enhance our offering in terms of real-time customer issue management, accessibility and connectivity between the buyer and seller.”
The system is also integrated with advanced software such as PaperCut for solutions and preventive maintenance hence leading to the lowest down time on machines. Estimate creation through the app on site and immediate access to inventory real time, immediate approval by customer and immediate repair through car stocks makes after sales service a less cumbersome task.
The vision of the project is to revolutionize the after sales service landscape in the island by introducing a state-of-the-art customer support module which will deliver globally renowned service levels to JKOA’s customers.
