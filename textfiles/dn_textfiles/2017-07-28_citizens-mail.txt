Citizens' Mail

Promoting A/C coaches
Presently the traffic congestion on the main roads of the country is high and the public transportation system of the country still seems to be inadequate. This is specially so during the rush hours of the mornings and evenings. This results in commuters having to waste hours on the road and some even having to do so standing in crowded buses. This also contributes largely to air pollution which presently is an important topic. Promoting the use of air-conditioned coaches in public transportation will be a solution to these problems.
The use of air conditioned (A/C) coaches should be promoted in both the medium and short distance public transport system in Sri Lanka. This is already available for long distances and some medium distance bus routes. This should be introduced to the short distance routes as well. It will have the following benefits:
l It will reduce the number of cars and other vehicles on the road and thereby reduce the fuel cost to the country.
l It will reduce the traffic congestion on the roads especially during rush hours by reducing the number of cars and three wheelers.
l It will benefit both the middle/lower class commuters.
Air conditioned private coaches are already available in middle distance routes such as Kollupitiya to Kaduwela. They are popular and is in great demand. They should also be introduced to routes such as Colombo to Panadura and Colombo to Homagama and to short distance routes as well.
A/C coaches are narrow (but tall) and do not take much more room on the road than cars. Hence when commuters using private cars transfer to A/C coaches it will reduce the number of cars on the road and will reduce traffic congestion significantly.
A fair number of car users use cars for travelling to office and back due to the inadequate public transport system. This is costing them a high amount as fuel cost. The government also spends a large amount of foreign exchange of the importation of fuel to the country. This could be reduced by the promotion of AC coaches in public transportation.
Presently the public transport system of the country requires many passengers to travel standing for as long as two hours inside buses to get home after office even at distance of about 15 miles. Some commuters still have to travel on foot board of buses during rush hours. (Such as in the Kollupitiya to Kohilawatte route) These problems could be solved effectively by promoting the use of AC coaches.
Since people in the higher income category are allowed to use cars at their own expense other people too should be allowed to travel in air conditioned coaches at their own expense.
