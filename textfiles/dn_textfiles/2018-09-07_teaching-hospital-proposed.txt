Teaching hospital proposed

It was proposed that the Kuliyapitiya Hospital could be converted into a teaching hospital for Wayamba University students, and that its reconstruction work should be handled by the Central Government.
It was suggested by Provincial Minister Lakshman Wedaruwa, during a monthly meeting. Chief Minister Dharmasiri Dassanayake said the matter should be solved by the council’s advisory committee.
