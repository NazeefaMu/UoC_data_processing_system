Navy sets up 21 more RO plants

Twenty-one more Reverse Osmosis (RO) plants constructed by the Navy were vested with the public recently.
Sri Lanka Navy’s Research and Development Unit spearheaded the setting up of these RO plants.
These RO plants are being set up in selected areas under a concept of President Maithripala Sirisena and with the sponsorship of the Presidential Task Force on Prevention of Chronic Kidney Disease,
Accordingly, six RO plants were opened at Maha Elagamuwa, Siri Seevali Raja Maha Viharaya, Moragoda, Sri Ashokarama Vidyalaya, Dambewatana and Pallegama Maha Vidyalaya in Kekirawa on September 14.
Five more RO units were opened at Pahalagama, Eriyagama, Kuda Ballan Katta, Pahalagama Gramaya, and Saman Eliya in Thambuththegama on September 18.
Further, three RO plants were also constructed at Siyambalagaswewa Viharaya in Thalawa, Dembata Wewa and Ambagaswewa in Horowpathana on the same day. Meanwhile five similar facilities were vested in the public at Naya Kapu Wewa, Maha Halmillewa, Bethkewa Sandika Wewa, Kalenika Wewa Viharaya and Mee Kumbukwewa in Kahatagasdigiliya on September 19. Taking the tally to 21, two more Reverse Osmosis plants were opened at Sri Jayasumanaramaya and Muddalama Muslim Maha Vidyalaya in Trincomalee on September 20.
This project, undertaken with funds provided by the Presidential Task Force on Prevention of Chronic Kidney Disease, will be carried out in many areas of the country in the future, utilising the Navy’s manpower, a Navy spokesman said.
