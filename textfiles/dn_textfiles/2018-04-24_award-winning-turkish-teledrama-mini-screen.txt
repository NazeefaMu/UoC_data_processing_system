Award winning Turkish teledrama  on the mini screen

“Muthu Ahura" ( Orphan Flowers or Kirgin Çiçekler in Turkey ) will be telecasting on TV Derana every weekday at 9.30 pm. The tele series tells the story of Eylül who, tired of her stepfather's abuse, tells her mother in the hopes of changing the situation for the better, but her mother prefers giving Eylül to an orphanage instead of leaving her husband.
Eylül will make different friends in the newly opened orphanage, which is located in the middle of a luxurious neighborhood. These girls who are excluded from the society are humiliated and slandered by rich guys of the area. When none of the public schools accept them because of this slander, the dormitory principal registers them to the luxurious private college of the neighborhood.
Now life will be more difficult for Eylül and her three friends among the rich and spoiled guys in their new school.
This teledrama was telecast ten countries, including Uruguay, Romania, Croatia, Greece, Moldavia, Macedonia, Indonesia and in Turkey. Furthermore this teledrama has won the prestigious 'Soul international teledrama award" as well.
