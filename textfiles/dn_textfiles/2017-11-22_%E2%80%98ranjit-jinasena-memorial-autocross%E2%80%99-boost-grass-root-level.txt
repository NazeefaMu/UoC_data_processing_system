‘Ranjit Jinasena Memorial Autocross’, a boost for grass root level

The Ceylon Motor Sports Club (CMSC), Sri Lanka’s oldest club involved in motor sport, come out once again to refresh the memories of many a stalwart in Motor Sport who knew the great Motor Racing Legend, Ranjit Jinasena, by conducting a
‘Members and Friends Autocross’ at the Jinasena Estate in Katana Negombo.
Ranjit to his piers, and uncle Ranjit to many of us, as he was fondly remembered knew him to be involved in many a pioneering events, that catered to grassroots level motor sport being enjoyed by novice drivers and riders.
Ranjit was the president of the CMSC, at the time of his passing away and his fervent wish was that he wanted to see young drivers come into the sport and for experienced drivers to represent Sri Lanka Overseas.
Having remembered his wishes, the CMSC, is organizing a 1.2km sprint type Autocross, which will bring back many memories of the past.
The CMSC is gearing this event, to suit the novice drivers in different classes, and invite competitors to bring their road going cars and take part in this type of event, which has been the birthplace of many a star today.
An Autocross is where a competitor drives on a demarcated route, which is within a private coconut estate, while the route is outlined by marker tapes. The competitor may for his ease have a navigator, which is not compulsory. Two runs will be given and the best cumulative time achieved will be classed as the winner. This is not a mass start type of event and each competitor will be timed alone.
All proceeds of this event will be in aid of RTJ’s favorite charity, the ‘Deaf and Blind School – Ratmalana’ where Nilanthi Jinasena still officiates as a trustee.
The President and his committee wish to invite all well wishes from yesterday who knew RTJ as well as new drivers who wish to have a Sunday out and experience the art of motor sport in your home car to come and try this event.
