‘Coco’ing it right!

Considered an elixir of sorts, coconut water is nature’s answer to all your health woes. Hydrating benefits aside, the beauty benefits of coconut water are aplenty. While coconut water can be used in myriad ways, we list the best possible ways to include them into your skincare routine.
The acne crusader: Have you been fighting acne for the longest? Coconut water could be what you’re looking at. The presence of lauric acid in coconut fights bacterial and fungal infections. Douse a cotton swab in coconut water, and gently apply across the face. Now, scrub gently before washing it off. Doing this on a regular basis helps keep blemishes and fine lines at bay.
Eczema curer: Constant application of fresh coconut water on affected areas has proven to be really effective. This is because the presence of constituents like potassium, lauric acid and cytokines hydrates the skin and helps to maintain the Ph balance.
A natural SPF: Rich in Vitamin C, coconut water helps to reduce sun burn to a great degree. That aside, coconut water is an excellent antioxidant.
Terrific toner: Want to minimise those pores? Swap your toner for tender coconut water. Coconut water could be the answer. It also helps to moisturise the skin.
Anti-ageing: Coconut water is rich in cytokines, protein and lauric acid. Cytokines encourages cell growth and cell activation.
