Rs. 14,500 million to establish new nursing faculty: Rajitha

A faculty will be established at a cost of Rs. 14,500 million to train 2,000 nurses at one time, Health Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne said.
The Minister was participating in a sports-meet of nurses held at Nuwara Eliya recently.
The Minister said four training schools would be developed to improve the profession to international level. He said foreign countries have a great demand for nursers.
Estate hospitals would be developed and steps had already been taken in this regard, he said. The Kalutara district has 14 estate hospitals, he said. Estate companies owned some estate hospitals and the ministry had taken them over to develop, he said.
The congestion at urban state hospitals can be eased by developing estate hospitals and a well planned programme was launched to develop the health sector, the Minister said.
Education State Minister V. Radhakrishnan, health officials and politicians were present.
