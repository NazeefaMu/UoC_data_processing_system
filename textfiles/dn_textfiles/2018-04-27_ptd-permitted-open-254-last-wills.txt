PTD permitted to open 254 last wills

Colombo Additional District Judge Chamath Madanayake had granted the Public Trustee Department (PTD) permission to open the last wills of around 254 individuals, that were kept in the department's safe during the past several decades, Deputy Public Trustee Gawri Karawita said.
She told the Daily News that the court had instructed the Public Trustee Department to hand over the deeds to the court registrar before April 28. She said however, that the registrar had still not given them a time and as soon as he does, they would proceed.
The said wills had been placed in the safe of the department since 1931 and are those of persons who had left their assets to their caretakers, wives, children, relatives, friends or for social service activities, after their demise.
Public Trustee Sanath Weeraratne had made an appeal to courts, to allow the PTD safe to be opened and action to be taken with regard to the last wills within it. Accordingly, the Colombo Additional District Judge had granted permission for the said purpose.
The Deputy Government Trustee said that as the information contained in the wills are unknown, subsequent to the safe being opened, future action would be taken after holding discussions with the relevant parties.
