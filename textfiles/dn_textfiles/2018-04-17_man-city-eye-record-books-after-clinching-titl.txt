Man City eye record books after clinching titl

LONDON, Sunday - Champions Manchester City have set their sights on rewriting the record books after clinching the Premier League title.
Pep Guardiola's side were crowned kings of English football on Sunday as their arch rivals Manchester United slumped to a shock 1-0 defeat against struggling West Bromwich Albion.
City are 16 points clear of second placed United, who can only take a maximum of 15 points from their remaining matches.
Given the way they have demolished all challengers in the league, it was apparent months ago that it was only a matter of when rather than if City would take the title.
But sealing the silverware thanks to a slip from old enemies United and their boss Jose Mourinho -- a long-time rival of Guardiola -- was a sweet moment, especially after they lost to their neighbours in the Manchester derby last weekend.
Winning the title with five matches to go makes City the joint earliest champions in the Premier League era -- matching the achievement of the 2000-01 Manchester United team.
That is just one of a welter of statistical feats that have led some to rank City among the Premier League's greatest ever teams.
Whether they deserve to be mentioned in the same breath as Manchester United's 1999 treble winners or the 2004 Arsenal ‘Invincibles’ is up for debate.
But City, who will stage a title party when they host Swansea on Sunday, have a chance to underline their credentials over their last five matches.
Fuelled by the majestic form of Kevin De Bruyne, David Silva, Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling, City set a new Premier League record earlier this season by winning 18 successive matches.
The Premier League's record points tally of 95, set by Chelsea in 2004-05, is within City's reach if they can take nine from their last fixtures.
With 28 league victories so far, City need three more wins to top Chelsea's record of 30 Premier League wins in a season.
United hold the current record Premier League winning margin of 18 points and that could also fall to City.
City have won 14 games on the road this season and have two to go away from home -- winning both of those would beat Chelsea's record of 15.
Guardiola's players will focus on those targets once they have recovered from a boisterous evening of celebrations in Manchester.
Former Barcelona and Bayern Munich boss Guardiola was all smiles when he was pictured arriving home after his golf outing.
City's title is the 24th trophy of his glittering career.
Speaking after Saturday's 3-1 win over Tottenham, the 47-year-old gave all the credit to his players. “I am so glad to be here and be part of this club. These guys are fantastic, awesome, they are incredible,” he said.
“This club is absolutely amazing in all terms.”
Third-placed Liverpool beat Bournemouth 3-0 at home with Mohamed Salah taking his goal tally for the season to 40 in all competitions — making him only the third Liverpool player to achieve that mark in a single campaign.
Sadio Mane and Roberto Firmino were also on target as Liverpool moved three points above Tottenham.
Liverpool are 10 points above fifth-placed Chelsea who hit back from two goals down at relegation-haunted Southampton to win 3-2 and keep alive their hopes of a top-four finish.
Third-from-bottom Southampton are five points from the safety zone after relegation rivals Crystal Palace beat Brighton & Hove Albion by the same score at Selhurst Park and Huddersfield Town beat Watford 1-0.
Swansea City are directly above Southampton after drawing 1-1 at home to Everton.
The action was just as furious at Selhurst Park with all the goals coming in the opening 34 minutes, including a first-ever league double for Palace’s Wilfried Zaha.
Huddersfield rose to 14th thanks to an injury-time goal by Tom Ince while Jordan Ayew returned from a three-match ban to earn Swansea a draw against Everton.
Burnley earned their fifth straight league win with a 2-1 victory over Leicester City at Turf Moor to boost their chances of possible Europa League qualification.
