Romesh tipped to retain Havelock SC presidency

Romesh Abeyawickrema is tipped to come in as president of Havelock Sports Club for another term. He will be elected at the 103rd Annual General Meeting which is set for 24 June at 11 am at the club house. The outgoing committee recommend the former Josephian sportsman to continue, as president for 2018/19 . Havelock SC founded in 1915 has a long history of rugby as the club's main sporting activity. In the good old days they had hockey and football too. They have their ground known as Havelock Park. Romesh hopes to continue the untiring efforts and good work done by many past rugby presidents
The club has produced some excellent players over the last few decades in the field of rugby, but in the last few years has struggled to retain its players with their good performers crossing over to other clubs. This club was inaugurated when 27 schoolboys from ages ranging from 12 to 16 years whose homes were in the vicinity of Havelock Park agreed to organize themselves into a club and thus the Havelock Sports Club came into existence.
The club had no constitution, no office bearers, no materials, no grounds, nothing but enthusiasm and comradeship. The inspiration and keenness for all this came from none other than a boy named Roy Joachim. In 1915 Roy together with the other boys got about setting up the club never dreaming that their juvenile efforts would reach maturity and that the club would live to take its place in the front ranks of the local sports celebrating 103 years this year. During that time tennis ball cricket and football were played regularly and were the most favored sports. Hockey was introduced at a later stage. Gradually interest in rugby grew and became popular and dominated all activities.
After the 2nd World War, when rugby was revived in 1949, Havelock SC became unofficial champions. And were the first Clifford Cup champions in 1950 unbeaten. The following year 1951, under Ian Labrooy in these two years no club crossed their goal line. Their next Clifford Cup win was in 1961 under Dr. Hubert Aloysius.
They won many a trophy at hockey also the Andriesz Shield in 1935 and 1960, the Pioneer Cup in 1950 and 1955 and first winners of the Bacon Cup in 1947 and several other trophies.
Down the years the club expanded and membership increased and they started their own club house, and the Colombo Municipal Council sanction could not be obtained for a permanent building which resulted in a compact cabin-like structure mounted on wheels being built. In August 1959, the new club house was declared open after the Municipal Council approved the grant.
Havelock SC was a top rugby playing club and dominated the game in the 1960-1980’s. It was the breeding ground for most of the young school leavers who later enlisted themselves at the Park club to progress forward in the sport. In recent times under the presidency of Asanga Seneviratne the ground was made a floodlit stadium.
