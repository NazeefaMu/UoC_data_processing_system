Solution to air pollution
Through this column, I would like to suggest some measures for controlling the growing air pollution in Colombo and suburbs.
First of all, all heavy vehicles should be restricted from entering the city. Such vehicles should be allowed only at certain times. Only light commercial vehicles should carry the goods to the heart of the city. The CTB and other private buses plying within the city should be given a separate lane. The three-wheelers should be banned and be replaced by small car-like cabs to transport commuters within the city.
Besides, all personal vehicles entering the city during the peak hour should be heavily fined. These steps along with the working of a complete railway in Colombo and suburbs will go a long way in controlling the growing air pollution in the city. Unless such and other similar steps are taken immediately, the problem of air pollution will certainly assume serious proportions.
I hope the concerned authorities will pay prompt attention to this growing menace which is sure to jeopardize people’s everyday life unless timely action is initiated.
