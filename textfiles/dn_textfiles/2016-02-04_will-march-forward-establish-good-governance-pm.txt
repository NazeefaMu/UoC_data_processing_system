Will march forward to establish good governance - PM

The United National Front (UNF) will march forward with the coalition of all parties that intend to establish good governance, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said.
The Prime Minister made this observation yesterday, following an MoU signed between the Democratic Party (DP) led by Field Marshal Sarath Fonseka and the UNF at Temple Trees.
He said all Tamil political parties too have pledged their support to form a National government.
LTTE leader Prabhakaran had demanded the people not to raise the National Flag. Those who pose themselves as patriots have also requested the people not to hoist the National Flag to celebrate independence. The Prime Minister said that those who identify themselves as patriots, have refused to hoist the National flag, when all communities have joined to take the country forward. The future political journey of the Democratic Party will be in coalition with the United National Front, Field Marshal Sarath Fonseka said. Stating that he started his political journey with the United National Party, Field Marshal Fonseka added that his future journey in the political arena would not be hard when working with Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe. Fonseka said that he contested the 2010 Presidential Elections as the common candidate to fight against a corrupt rule, adding that he would continue to raise his voice against corruption.
UNP General Secretary and Public Enterprises Development Minister Kabir Hashim and Ministers Lakshman Kiriella, Malik Samarawickrama, Rajitha Senaratne, Ravi Karunanayake and Deputy Minister Ruwan Wijewardene were present.
