Stuart Law turns down Pak coaching job offer

KARACHI: Former Australian cricketer Stuart Law has turned down Pakistan Cricket Board's offer of being the next chief coach of Pakistan cricket team. The Pakistan Cricket Board said it will try to convince Law or choose from Englishman Andy Moles and Australian Test batsman Dean Jones.
"Yes there are hurdles in the way of signing on Stuart Law as head coach although he is our first choice for this position," PCB Chairman, Shaharyar Khan told PTI.
"He had applied for a coaching position with us but he has now conveyed he is more interested in a consultant's position and that he wouldn't be able to join the team immediately," Khan said. Currently, Law is already signed up by Cricket Australia as a batting consultant for the tour to Sri Lanka from July to September and apparently he has told the PCB he is also not available when Pakistan tours Australia in November-December this year. Khan admitted that finding the right person for the job had become a tedious task for the board.
Notably, Waqar Younis recently stepped down as the chief coach of the team, following a series of poor performances in limited-overs cricket. - ZMB
