Vim Diviyata Disne wows women across Sri Lanka

The Vim Diviyata Disne consumer promotion concluded recently with an awards ceremony at the Unilever Sri Lanka headquarters which saw winners walking away with up to Rs.2 million in prizes.
An initiative to light the spark of entrepreneurship in women, the Vim DiviyataDisne consumer promotion continued this legacy of empowerment by giving people the chance to win grand prizes of Rs.100,000 or individual prizes of Rs.10,000 that would go a long way to funding their entrepreneurial dreams.
To enter the promotion consumers had to purchase a Vim bar and SMS the unique code found inside the wrapper. There were no restrictions on the number of codes an individual could send in, however, only one entry per wrapper was allowed.
The six grand prize winners were D.H.Samanthika Mathirathna,. Jayasinghe Arachchige Deshani Chathurika Kumarihami, D.G.Yasapala; R.M.Priyanthika; AlvangeSanjeewa and J. Chamila Dilhani. 150 other lucky individuals took home prizes of Rs.10,000 each.
“This promotion was born from our long association with Sri Lankan housewives and bringing the brightness into their lives. Following the success of our workshops, which armed women with the tools necessary to take advantage of the opportunities available to them and fulfill their dreams, we decided to take it a step further and help them fund those dreams. And the overwhelming feedback we received was further proof that the promotion was a resounding success.
We are proud to have had a small and positive impact on their lives,” said Unilever Sri Lanka Home care Marketing Manager FazlanFaizal.
A joint initiative of Unilever Sri Lanka’s Vim and the Ministry of Women and Child Affairs, Vim DiviyataDisne was launched under the auspices of President Maithripala Sirisena in Ampara on this International Women’s Day.
The forum aims to bring together stakeholders from various industries to enlighten Sri Lankan women on the opportunities available to them in areas such as agriculture, cooking, sewing and beauty and personal grooming and impart knowledge on managing a business, availing financial support and using Information Technology.
