Cafe reserved for stuffed animals

The Nuigurumi Cafe, which just opened its doors in Tokyo (inevitably), is a cafe reserved only for stuffed animals! There’s no food, drink, tables, chairs or even place for humans, but a system that allows stuffed animals owners to mail their favorite pet, to receive them again the next day, accompanied by pictures of their visit at the cafe. At the Nuigurumi Cafe: hot drinks, snacks, games and souvenir album! And if your plushies do not yet have enough, there is also Unagi Travel, the travel agency for stuffed animals. Ufunk
