Crysbro celebrates annual get-together, awards night

Crysbro celebrated its Annual Get-together and Awards Night 2017 with members of their staff and management at the Mahinda Rajapaksa Auditorium at Polgolla on April 30.
Organised by the Crysbro HR Team together with the Employee Welfare Society, the occasion was a fun-filled outdoor event with a festive atmosphere, offering awards, prizes, gifts and tokens, together with exciting activities for all.
As Crysbro Group’s breeding centres, processing plants, factories, mills and farmlands are dispersed across many parts of the island, workers from these areas were transported to the venue and back, adding to their enjoyment and fond memories of the celebrations. Crysbro Annual Get-together and Awards Night 2017 was graced by the Chairman and Managing Director of Crysbro Group, Mohamed Imtiaz, members of the Board of Directors, Senior management and well-wishers.
The highlight of Crysbro Day was the presentation of new houses to members of the staff, who were chosen after a careful evaluation by the Crysbro Employees Welfare Society, who undertook field visits and carried out needs-assessment.
Four employees received new houses, while another nine were provided financial assistance to carry out renovations to their homes. Since 2012, Crysbro has offered, as outright gifts, 23 new houses to its employees, with another 40 receiving cash for carrying out renovations.
Long-standing employees, who had completed five, ten 20, and 25 years respectively were rewarded with service certificates, cash awards and tokens of appreciation.
Sixty one Crysbro employees who had served the Group loyally over the years were award. In addition, continuing its tradition of recognizing and rewarding the crème-de-la-crème of its staff, 29 top performers in various business teams of 2016 were awarded. 16 junior category employees were awarded with cash prizes and local family day-outing while 10 executive level employees were awarded with cash prizes and family one-night outing in a local star class hotel. Three Senior Managers were awarded a family overseas tour.
Previously the event was organized atn the Crysbro Head Office premises at Gampola but this time the venue was shifted to a more spacious exterior venue in a bid to accommodate a grand celebration as well as to give a diverse experience to the employees, a concept mooted by the Board of Directors M. Imitiaz and M. Shafeek Samad.
Crysbro Group, counts over four decades of experience at the forefront of producing chicken in Sri Lanka, has been providing its valued clients with high quality, hygienic and fresh chicken over the years.
