'Responsibility of the government to fulfil people’s mandate'

 
 It is the responsibility of the government to fulfil people’s mandate, even the Mahanayake Theras are a part of it said Cabinet Spokesperson and Minister of Health and Indigenous Medicine Rajitha Senarathne, today.
He made this observation at the cabinet press conference when asked about the Maha Sangha led by the Mahanayake Theras of three Nikayas  decision that there is no need to bring in new Constitution as it will create more conflicts in the country.
“The final decision has to be made by the parliament. Six committees have been appointed in which some secretaries are from the opposition. The whole parliament now sits in as a constitution assembly like in 1972. The reports formulated by these six committees will be submitted to the Parliament. If it is passed by two thirds majority and if the Supreme Court orders to go for a referendum, people can come up with their opinions”, he said.
Minister Senaratne said that before objecting to the drafting of the new constitution, they should understand the real objectives and questioned for how long that the country can run without a new constitution.
“We are formulating the new constitution to implement it and not just to keep watching. People can express their views and opinions when it is completed. We cannot come to a final decision based on opinions forwarded by some organizations. It has been clearly stated that the new constitution will be implemented only if the Sinhala majority agrees to it”, he said.
Minister Senaratne pointed out that even in the past important decisions like making the Tamil language one of the national languages and devolving the power were opposed initially but later they were introduced.
Sports Minister Dayasiri Jayasekara said that the final draft of the constitution is not yet completed and it is still under discussion.
“Many have expressed their opinions individually as well as a party. Some they agree to the proposals made at the committee meeting but would go out and object it”, he said.
He stressed that the people need to understand the real objectives behind the need for a new constitution for the betterment of the country.
