NOLIMIT Founder recognized as ‘Passionate by Business Today

The Founder of NOLIMIT, a leading fashion retail chain in Sri Lanka N.L.M. Mubarack, was among the 13 individuals selected by Business Today magazine and recognized as ‘Passionate.’
The business magazine stated its criteria for selecting ‘Passionate’ award winners as ‘through their determination, creativity and individuality have brought recognition to Sri Lanka in the global sphere.’ The ‘Passionate 2017’ recognition was introduced to mark the publication’s 20th anniversary. BusinessToday identified N.L.M. Mubarack as “a pioneer in organized retail that reshaped the fashion industry in Sri Lanka. With an aim to innovate rather than follow, he introduced self-shopping in the country.”
At the presentation of the awards, he said “As I stand before you today I am overwhelmed, to be honest because I truly believe being recognized for one’s passion goes beyond any other recognition.”
The fashion retail stores he introduced in 1992 was driven by his entrepreneurial leadership. French Corner was the initial retail business which was re-branded in 2005 as NOLIMIT which has now expanded to 21 state-of-the-art branches enabling customers to access the brand from convenient locations across the island.
“As a company celebrating a quarter century of operations, we believe that everyone in Sri Lanka deserve to look good, feel confident and be upwardly mobile” he said. Today the retail chain is a shopping destination that caters to the fashion needs of the entire family. In addition to NOLIMIT, there is Glitz, a lifestyle store, Pallu for ethnic wear and the discount store Y Pay More. NOLIMIT has its own in-house design team that develops brands and also has products sourced from overseas as well as locally manufactured products to offer a wider range to customers.
