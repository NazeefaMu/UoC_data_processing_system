Case on SLRC funds abuse re-fixed for trial

A corruption case filed against former Minister Keheliya Rambukwella and two others for allegedly causing an unlawful loss to the Government in purchasing 600 GI Pipes with the Sri Lanka Rupavahini Corporation’s (SLRC) funds during the previous Presidential Election was yesterday re-fixed for trial by Colombo Chief Magistrate Ranga Dissanayake.
When the case was taken up before Colombo Chief Magistrate Court, the case was fixed for trial on October 12.
The Commission to Investigate Allegations of Bribery or Corruption (CIABOC) had filed charges against the former Minister Rambukwella, former SLRC Director General Chandrapala Liyanage and former SLRC Chairman Wimal Rubasinghe under section 70 of the Bribery Act.
The Bribery Commission alleged that the three accused in the case had incurred a loss of Rs. 990, 000 to the SLRC in an unnecessary purchasing of 600 of GI pipes on or around December 2, 2014.
