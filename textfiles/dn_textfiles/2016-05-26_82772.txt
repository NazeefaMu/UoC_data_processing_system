Hero forays into  motorcycle racing

 
Hero MotoCorp Ltd (HMCL), the world’s largest two-wheeler manufacturer, forayed into the world of motorcycle rally racing by forming a strategic partnership with Speedbrain GmbH, the German off-road racing specialist. The newly formed ‘Hero MotoSports Team Rally’ will make its debut at the Merzouga Rally in Morocco later this month, a Dakar series race.
The team will be riding on the upgraded version of the successful Speedbrain 450 rally bike. The Merzouga Rally will be held from May 21 to 27 2016. The Hero MotoSports Team Rally will also participate in international rallies across the globe, leading up to the Dakar rally 2017.
Flying the new colours will be the riders CS Santosh and Joaquim Rodrigues.
Santosh, the off-road motorcycle star from India, has participated in several international rally events and is poised to make a mark in the global racing arena. His teammate ‘J-Rod’ from Portugal is a rookie in rally sport.
However, being a former Motocross and Supercross factory pilot, he is extremely professional with strong determination to prove his talent. The team will be headed by Mr. Wolfgang Fischer, Managing Director, Speedbrain.
The Hero MotoSports Team Rally will be under the direct supervision of Dr. Markus Braunsperger, Chief Technology Officer (CTO), Hero MotoCorp, and will work in close collaboration with his team at the Hero Centre of Innovation and Technology.
The Hero MotoSports Team Rally will also assist in development and testing of new Hero vehicles concepts, using the data collected from the races.
