Plight of those fenced off

The electric fence had often been proposed as a ‘magic solution’ to many of the problems faced as a result of the human-elephant conflict raging in many parts of the island. Whilst it has benefitted some, the fence, when erected in an unplanned manner, had caused more harm than good in the lives of those it is supposed to protect. At many a time, the electric fence had been erected through the village, splitting it in half and dividing a people rather than keeping the elephants out.
The Government had introduced many schemes to compensate these villages, but the crux of the matter is that many of these programmes do not address the grievances of the affected people and at times, don’t work at all.
Failed schemes
The village of Porasankulama lies in the 63rd Division of the Galgamuwa Divisional Secretariat. It is a hot spot for human-elephant conflicts, being no different to many of the villages in Galgamuwa which constantly live in fear of elephant attacks. But today, the villagers of Porasankulama complain that they feel as if they have fallen from the frying pan and into the fire.
An electric fence built through the village of Porasankulam 12 years ago, has led to many villagers losing their lands; many 'jayabhoomi' or title deed lands. They had, in total, sacrificed over 100 acres of their lands to the fence and at present, have no land to grow produce for their own survival.
While the poorly planned fence stands despite protests from the village, government officials who insist on the fence staying have cared little for anything else. The village is yet to see a proper access road being constructed and has very few amenities to boast of in addition to the village attacks.
“We suffer untold grievances due to this electric fence. Five out of seven days of the week are spent running around the country complaining to various officials about this fence.
These are our ancestral lands. It has been 12 years since the fence was erected and since then, we have not been able to work in any of our fields,” said W. M. Sisira Kumara, 40.
He complained that when villagers tried to venture beyond the fence to cultivate lands, Wildlife Department officials prevented them from doing so and sued them for such actions.
“My hearts breaks having to see all our fields turn into wastelands. We are all farmers here; this is all we know. Elephant problems, water, roads, we have many grievances. We lost our paddy along with our fields and so, we have no rice either. We don’t even have space to grow some vegetables. They combined all of these lands to erect the fence. The officials did not go about this in a proper way. I feel that this fence was erected over our very own lives,” he added.
W.P. Seeman, 60, lost three acres of land given to him by his father, to the fence. He had to use up another two acres to build his own house and now is left with very little land to make a living on.
“We are pleased that they erected this fence. This is a must for the village. But we lost many things to build this fence. We don’t want compensation from the Government, what we ask from them is that we get back our lands. A fence should not be erected at the expense of peoples’ lands. You need to build a fence which will keep the wild elephants away from the crops we grow, we grow nothing now. There are 155 families in this village and almost all of them have suffered as a result of this fence,” he said.
Government officials, however, have been pressurizing the villagers to take the compensation. B.G. Jayatissa, 48, explained that both Wildlife and Forest officers had visited their village many times to convince them to come to a settlement over the lands.
“These officials who work for the Government do not understand the value of our lands. Though they say those things for their own convenience, we cannot lose the right to our lands which we have had since the time of our great grandfathers. Only we know of the pain of having lost these lands. One and a half acres of my own land was lost to this fence. I don’t even have space to grow some basic vegetables. We have now been reduced to labourers in other peoples’ lands, we no longer have the blessing of growing our own produce. I am saddened every time I remember how all these abandoned fields were once green”, he said.
B.G. Asilin, 51, in the meantime explained that the fence was initially supposed to be built on forest land, but later changed due to officials not wanting to take on the extra work of clearing forest land.
“Before this fence was erected, the officials informed us that we could carry on with our farming with no problem at all. They were too lazy to clear the jungle, so they erected the fence on our own lands. We have written letters and petitions about this problem to every place possible,” she said.
According to Asilin, on April 26, 2011, they received a letter from the Kurunegala Land Commissioner’s Office informing them that all lands should be returned to their rightful owners. Officials from the Surveyor General’s Department had arrived to survey the land, but had soon left, complaining that the lands were all overgrown.
“They asked us to clean the jungle and keep it for them to survey. When we went to clear the jungle, Wildlife officials asked us not to do that. Thus, we have become similar to iron which is beaten from all sides,” she said.
Pressure for compensation
As the villagers fight on, Wildlife Officials, according to W.P. Lakshman, 52, have said that they might risk losing both the lands as well as any compensation awarded to them,
“It is true that we have an elephant problem and it is also true that an electric fence is needed to resolve it but we cannot stand aside and let them use our own lands for the fence; making it difficult for us to have a livelihood. We might just perish in the end. We have informed the Galgamuwa Divisional Secretariat of this problem and I ask the officials to solve this issue as soon as possible”, he said.
A Wildlife Officer of the Department of Wildlife Office in Meegallewa, speaking to the Daily News, admitted to there being an issue and said, “Even though we tried to get these people compensation for the lands they lost, they are not in favour of it. The Government thus far has no scheme to provide alternative lands to those who have lost their lands due to a fence.”
Attempts made to contact Wildlife and Sustainable Development Minister Gamini Jayawickrama Perera proved futile.
The situation faced by the villagers of Porasankulama is dire. Those who wish to be buried in their own places of birth, no longer have land to have that wish fulfilled. Village life too has been boxed in as a result of the fence; common spaces such as a sports ground, place to meet as a community, all have been lost. The map of Porasankulama shows a village sprawled over many acres, but in reality, the villagers have no access to their lands beyond the electric fence. Like the elephants, the villagers too have been fenced out.
Paddy fields which have not been ploughed for 12 years.
