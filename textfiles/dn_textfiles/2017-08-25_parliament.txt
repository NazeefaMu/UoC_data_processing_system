SLMC will not vote for LG Election Bill if its anomalies not rectified: Hakeem
The Sri Lanka Muslim Congress (SLMC) will not vote for the Local Government Election Amendment Bill if certain anomalies are not rectified, its leader Minister Ruff Hakeem said in Parliament yesterday.
"We need a firm answer from the the Local Government Minister that the anomalies would be corrected in time to come so that we can tell our people that we have voted with the government," Minister Hakeem said.
"We can't accept the vague answers. If so we will have to abstain from voting."
He was participating in the second reading debate on the Local Authorities Elections (Amendment) Bill.
Minister Hakeem said that some wards were carved out in a way that ethnic minorities were affected. "The Samanthrei Pradeshiya sabha with 40,000 voters was allocated 10 members," Minister Hakeem said. "20 members are elected from Dehiattakandiya, which has similar population. How can this be?", he asked.

EC New electoral register disfranchised thousands: Dinesh
Joint Opposition Parliamentary Group Leader Dinesh Gunawardena complained that the latest electoral register prepared by the Elections Commission has disfranchised thousands across Sri Lanka.
The MP made the observation participating in the debate on the Local Authorities Elections (Amendment) Bill in Parliament yesterday.
He requested to take immediate steps to register those who were denied of voting rights.
Gunawardena demanded the Government to articulate the date of holding the long overdue Local Government Elections. “We will support to pass the legislation through, but speak out the date you intend to hold the elections,” he said.
He requested the Government to facilitate a special discussion on the subsequent amendments the Government is hoping to move at the Committee stage.
“There are as many as 50 such amendments. We received them this morning and want time to study. These change the intention of the legislation. The earlier proposed 70 percent allocation for Proportional Representation was reduced. Even the Elections Commission Chairman was unable to predict the result of the proposed amendments. The amendments will clearly lead to chaos,” he said.
MP Gunawardena failed to submit any Amendment to the Bill on behalf the JO group despite the repeated requests of Leader of the House and Minister Lakshman Kiriella to do so, if any. Kiriella questioned the bona fide of JO in demanding to hold the elections immediately while dragging the feet of the Government in passing the legislation.
“The JVP submitted four Amendments and we are ready to discuss them. The JO neither submit any proposal nor support our amendments,” the minister said.

Reports on misusing Air Force helicopters will be submitted to Parliament: Wijewardene
Defence State Minister Ruwan Wijewardene yesterday agreed to furnish a report to Parliament stating whether the Ministers and MPs who used helicopters of Sri Lanka Air Force in 2015 and 2016 had used public funds to pay for helicopters.
The State Minister, replying to a question by Pivithuru Hela Urumaya Leader Udaya Gammanpila, said, "only the President, the Prime Minister and the Defence Minister are entitled to use the Air Force helicopters free of charge".
“In addition, the Air Force, on the request of Foreign Affairs Ministry and on the approval of Defence Ministry, provides helicopters free of charge to Heads of State of other countries when they are visiting Sri Lanka.
Any other person who uses the Air Force helicopters, upon the approval of the Defence Ministry, must make due payments for their local air travels,” Wijewardene explained.
The Minister, confirming that a number of Ministers and MPs have used Air Force helicopters in 2015 and 2016, said he was not in a position to exactly say who paid for the expenses and for what reasons they travelled by air locally.
The Minister agreed to inform the House after confirming the veracity of that information what Ministers, MPs and officers used the Air Force helicopters from January 9, 2015 to October 31, 2016 and whether those payments had been settled using funds from the Government, State Corporations or State-Owned Companies.
Government had no need to postpone elections: Musthapa
The Unity Government at any stage had no need to postpone elections but it had to be done due to the flaws of the delimitation done during the previous regime, Provincial Councils and Local Government Minister Faizer Musthapa said in Parliament yesterday.
He said he had to go for an appeal review process that took one and half years due to the fact that the delimitation was done during the previous regime according to the need of the then Minister Basil Rajapaksa.
"Actually it was not done by the Sri Lanka Freedom Party but on the need of a then Minister," Minister Faizer Musthapa said.
"Although it was the background to the delay for the election, the opposition members levelled various baseless allegations against the government," Minister Musthapa said. "The Government had not at any stage attempted to postpone the elections."
He was participating the second reading debate on the Local Authorities Elections (Amendment) Bill.
The Minister said that although Basil Rajapaksa commenced the delimitation in 2012, he had failed to handover the report to the President.
"It had to be handed over to the President during the Good Governance Government," Minister Musthapa said. "They had done it in cool rooms.
So we had to take one and half years to meet the people of ground level to formulate better one that would be accepted by all."
He said that in line with the election pledge by the President, the Government could made the amendment which increase the First Past the Post System to 40 percent and the Proportional Representation to 60 percent while guaranteeing the women's representation at least 25 percent.
"The increase of the women's representation is very progressive, and we request the members not to nominate their wives and sisters to protect the spirit of these amendments and to guarantee the women of the ground level get their opportunities too," Minister Musthapa said.
He said some members of the minority groups are not contended with some of the clauses.
"But everybody should know that former one had been formulated to suppress the representation of the minority groups and this one is more progressive in that context," Minister said.
"So I have to say that Minister Rauff Hakeem's and Rishad Bathideen's concerns would be solved."
Minister Hakeem said the JVP's request of reducing the deposits to Rs. 1,500 would be solved.
The Minister requested all to support the motion to enable to elect a member who is answerable to the electorate.
