VIRGIL’S INCREDIBLE AENEID

Those who read S T Coleridge's Ancient Mariner will find a similarity between the mariner and Aeneas both whom encountered illusions on high seas and finally to reality in their different ways. We find AENEID as a part of Hardy's background and a little bit of Milton's.
To know nothing of Virgil is to miss clues to English poets from Chaucer onwards at one time or another had some words or incidents strike their minds. Admittedly Virgil is very remote from the last quart-century to the twenty-first century we live in. It is a way of saying that to readers accustomed only to subject-matter and literary treatment of today whose sense of human dignity go beyond any particular age, will discover only an arid strangeness as the computer is quick to establish.
But Virgil (70 BC - 19 BC) has always been a trauma to me. I never understood him nor do I today the way he is revered as the great poet who wrote THE AENEID. Yet, it is something far closer to us than any abstraction based on determinism found in the heads and minds of German philosophers. No doubt he represented their hope and of the people scattered around the Mediterranean.
Destiny appeared more of a challenge and it came as a surprise that in the Christian epoch which took root few years after his death, Virgil's apprehensions were in some way approved by the Church.
Livy’s history
When nation after nation looked back, he stood steadfastly between the ancient world and the mediaeval world which drew out of decay. This led Dante way back to 1300 in an attitude to co-opt figures of Livy's history as well as the Holy Bible in the same vivid reality found in the Old Testament. This makes today's reader unlikely to be attracted and denounce Virgil as a poet of the Imperial Rome of the day.
We Christians believe in the coming of the Messiah as found in the New Testament that Virgil never knew. Therefore, his Aeneas was in consultation with subsequent visits to the underworld when he encounters with the future heroes of Rome as they pass before his eyes.
At this point, the reader must realize this is not reality but pure fiction found in the mind of Virgil and translations over centuries, may have given different twists to the original horror found in his painful, unwinding poem the world of literature came to know as THE AENEID. There have been many attempts to re-tell the story in part as well in its original form but the ever-complicating mass of subjects found in THE AENEID, the versions became exaggerated and some ending in 'blank verses'.
The first and the best was by a Scot, Gavin Douglas (1476 - 1522) from the original script to be followed by the first English version by the Earl of Surrey (1517 - 1547) with many more poets attempting translations but the most brilliant is unquestionable was by John Dryden (1631 - 1700) which he carried through to vigorous and cracking pace. This version had over-shadowed the original THE AENEID and perhaps had Virgil lived to read it, may have amazed him had he known English.
British invasion
I am a poetry person but this one-mile long poem rattled every bone in my body. To Virgil 's credit, every line coined - up with the following and linked in meaning.
It is as though he wrote a horror movies script, from hell to underworld mystery. No doubt Virgil was influenced and inspired by the outstanding historical events during his lifetime beginning from 70 BC. There was the invasion of Britain by Caesar that resulted in the outbreak of Civil war between Caesar and Pompey.
After the Battle of Thapsus and Pompey's death in Egypt. Next in line was the Dictatorship of Caesar and his assassination (15th March, 44 BC).
The murder of Cicero and the death of Brutus and Cassius. After the marriage of Antony and Octavia, the Empire was divided between Antony's and link to Cleopatra, he divorces Octavia and in the Battle of Actium, Antony and Cleopatra are defeated. These events are well known to literature people who studied Antony and Cleopatra as well as Julius Caesar by William Shakespeare.
'There was an ancient city with Tyrian colonists,
Carthage, across the sea of Italy.
And the Tiber delta, a prosperous city it was
With tough fighters who understood their business
Juno preferred it before all other lands
Even Samos itself: here was her armoury
Here was her chariot, and her intention was
That it should rule the nations of the earth
If so the fates allowed, with her support
She had, however, heard of another race
Which had its origin from Trojan blood
And was one day to wreck the Tyrian stronghold'….
Long narrative
Virgil revelled in the rich variety of beautiful and resonant names found in THE AENEID much like all ancient poets amongst mythology and history. So he includes all such characters and the long poem is brimming and overflowing in their essence. Greek Gods taking charge, Shakespearean characters in input and warriors at the battle. Sadly, once the reader has finished with this long narrative, he is left perplexed without a story or fable. Finally, there is a cast of thousands in sweeping historical narration and most are mentioned only once and they are the less important ones.
For me reading THE AENEID was a challenge and still is. I still do not know where it started and when and where it ended. I was urged by my lecturer, Prof. Ashley Halpe to read the text in an effort to induce my mind to grasp ancient history as well as (loosely) translated English he guessed I would need in the future for writing knowing where my aptitude lay. THE AENEID was unfinished when he died but was hailed as a classic and a rival to Homer's ILIAD and the first Roman Emperor, Augustus declared it as an immortal masterpiece and a glorious gift for him in his reign.
He was the most famous living poet in Rome writing prestigious literary works.
Powerful resonance
The Fall of Troy that Virgil mention in the poem narrated by Homer is the inevitable result of the ILIAD. The Greek antiquarianism and Roman folklore had acquired powerful resonance in Virgil's lifetime. Virgil was only two years old when the very young Julius Caesar stood up in the forum and delivered a funeral speech in praise of his aunt. When the same Julius Caesar destroyed the Roman Republic and became the supreme ruler of Rome. The narrative is cyclical in pattern and pervade the meaning and somewhat potentially beneficial in nature like the return of the Golden Age. However, the poem refuses to gloss over the catastrophic toll while celebrating the foundation of the Roman Empire in the process of both the victors and the vanquished.
THE AENEID acts out a systematic series of exclusions in constructing its picture even in an imperial race. Virgil may have invented THE AENEID and its colossal and spectacular literary essence for poetry to carry forward to the future and no one appeared even at a striking distance to him.
