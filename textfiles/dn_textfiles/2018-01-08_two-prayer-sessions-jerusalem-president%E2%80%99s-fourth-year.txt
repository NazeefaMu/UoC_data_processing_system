Two prayer sessions in Jerusalem for President’s fourth year

Two prayer sessions would be held on January 8 at Al-Aqsa Mosque in Jerusalem, which is the first direction (Kibla) for the prayers of Muslims and also their third holiest place and the Nativity Church in Bethlehem, the birth place of Jesus Christ, to mark the commencement of President Maithripala Sirisena’s fourth year in office.
The prayer sessions have been organized by the Sri Lankan Embassy in Palestine. “We have made arrangements to conduct the prayers at the above two world-renowned holy places to seek blessings for the President and the country at this important occasion,” Sri Lankan Ambassador to Palestine Fawzan Anver said.
Prayers would be conducted at 11.30 am after Luhar Prayers, and other prayers will be held at the Nativity Church in Bethlehem at 3.00 pm.
