Private hospital channelling sewage to drain: Gampaha MC to act

The Gampaha Municipal Council acting on public complaints has decided to take legal action against a private hospital and a hotel which have caused environmental pollution by releasing sewage, including human excreta into a main drain in the Gampaha town. Municipal PHI S.M. Sumanasekara said investigators have witnessed the sewage being released into the drain by a gully bowser which had collected sewage from another point.
The Bower driver had abandoned the vehicle and fled on seeing the PHIs.
