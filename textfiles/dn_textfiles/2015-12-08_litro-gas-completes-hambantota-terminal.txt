Litro Gas completes Hambantota terminal

Litro Gas has exhibited a significant sales growth of above 30pct in the domestic market during the first 10 months of this year. This complements with the imposed price reductions by the government.
The recent decision taken by the government to reduce the price of 12.5 kg domestic LP gas will further have a positive impact on its sales and volume, which are expected to surge by end this year,the company said yesterday.
The price reductions imposed within a year is significant (44pct) benefitting the lower and middle-lower customer segments, and this has allowed households in both urban and rural areas throughout the country to switch from the traditional firewood to LP gas which today is an affordable cooking fuel.
Litro Gas enjoys a market share of around 73pct and is increasingly capable of catering to the growing demand of the entire LP gas market in the country with its current infrastructure.
Litro Gas Lanka Executive Chairman Shalila Moonesinghe said 'We've had a very positive performance during the last ten months with favourable market conditions. Our increased storage capacity and sales channels shows our ambitious plans to expand our reach of domestic LPG gas to every household in the country.'
Recently the company completed its new LP gas terminal located at the port of Hambantota consisting a storage capacity of 3,000 m/t. The storage facility of Litro Gas now increases up to 11,000 m/t with this new addition.
Litro Gas also moved its' filling operations to its new filling plant in Kerawalapitiya, which is one of the largest LP gas filling plants in the Asian continent.
