Tourism, promising field for investments - Japan FM

A business delegation comprising nearly 100 members from the Japan Chamber of Commerce and Industry will visit Sri Lanka this month to explore investment opportunities, Japanese Foreign Minister Taro Kono said in an exclusive interview with the Daily News Business’.
Through various exchanges including this business delegation, I expect to further increase investment from Japan to Sri Lanka, he added.
Japanese Foreign Minister Taro Kono arrived in Sri Lanka for a two day official visit yesterday evening. This is the first time in 15 years that a Japanese Foreign Minister is visiting Sri Lanka.
Kono said the tourism sector in Sri Lanka was a promising field for investments.
I understand that the tourists who visit Sri Lanka from abroad have been on the rise especially after the end of the conflict in 2009. In recent years, the number of Japanese tourists has also increased to more than 40,000 per year, and I think the tourism sector in Sri Lanka is a promising field for investments, he said.
Kono added that annual bilateral trade between Japan and Sri Lanka exceeds 100 billion Japanese Yen (approximately Rs.170 billion) and more than 130 Japanese companies are currently present in Sri Lanka.
He predicted that these figures will continue to grow with more Japan supported business on the pipeline.
