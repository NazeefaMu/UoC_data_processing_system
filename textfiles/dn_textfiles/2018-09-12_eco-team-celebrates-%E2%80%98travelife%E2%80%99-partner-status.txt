Eco Team celebrates ‘Travelife’ Partner Status

Recognising Eco Team’s pioneering spirit and commitment to measurable sustainability, ‘Travelife’ has awarded ‘the company partner status.’
Todate Eco Team remains the only eco and adventure tourism entity in the country to be accredited as a partner by Travelife.
“In our quest for a holistic approach to sustainable tourism the Travelife partner status helps us improve our own practices, while serving to inspire travellers and all those involved in the industry to support responsible and ethical tourism,” said Anuruddha Bandara, CEO, Eco Team.
Travelife is a leading training, management and certification initiative for tourism companies that are committed to sustainability. It provides companies with realistic sustainability goals, tools and solutions to implement positive change within their businesses and supply chains. Travelife is managed by the Travel Association in the UK and by European Centre for Ecological and Agricultural Tourism (ECEAT), ECEAT Projects - a not-for-profit organisation based in The Netherlands.
While striving to help improve standards for responsible travel and sustainable tourism, by obtaining Travelife partner status, Eco Team also ensures stringent standards on various aspects of the business. This mainly includes focusing on providing service delivery to guests with minimal negative impact on the environment and communities.
Consciously seeking ways to positively impact the environment, the Eco Team has also pioneered intuitive initiatives such as introducing glass bottles at allat all Tented Safari Camps that Eco Team manages, recycling aluminium and metal, paper and cardboard and PET bottles.
While demonstrating meaningful and lasting benefits for the natural environment and communities that surround its operations, Eco Team’s signature blend of natural luxury camps Mahoora and Big Game are included within this accreditation. Mahoora was the first to receive this status in the first quarter of 2017.
Founded two decades ago, as a pioneering eco and adventure tourism company, Eco Team has today emerged as a specialist, changing the industry landscape tourism through many other niche segments.
