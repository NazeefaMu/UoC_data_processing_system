The Sri Lanka Navy on Monday, assisted in transferring a critically ill fisherman ashore for treatment. The fisherman was on board a multi-day fishing vessel named ‘Nisal Putha’ which had ventured into the sea for fishing from the Tangalle Fisheries Harbour.
Acting swiftly upon information received from the Department of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources, the Navy dispatched the Fast Attack Craft P 432 to rescue the patient. The Naval personnel onboard reached the location to rescue the patient 106 nautical miles off Dondra Point.
