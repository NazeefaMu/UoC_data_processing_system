Busy bees!

The Bees! What industrious creatures! Truly in the animal kingdom you cannot find better team players!. Garden Talk meets up with Deputy Provincial Director of Agriculture Ratmalana, District Agricultural Instructor K.N.K Jayathilake on Bee Keeping which is an important part of Home Gardening. “Honey should be an important part of our diet. So it is highly advisable for people to maintain Bee Honey Boxes and obtain the necessary honey for the household. We need to include honey in our food intake in a small amount,” said Jayathilake
Honey Bees can be divided into two categories. Bees with Stings and Bees without stings. Bees with stings can be further categorized into three-
· Apis Dorsata
· Apis Florea
· Apis Cerana Indica
Bees without Stings are in one category – Trigona Irridipennis
All collect Honey.
“Apis Cerena Indica is the Asiatic Honey Bee and is common in Sri Lanka. This is the variety that Sri Lankan Bee Keepers obtain honey from,” stated Jayathilake
Egg types

The Most important member in the Hive is the Queen Bee. She lays two types of eggs. They are the Worker Eggs and the Male Eggs
“The Worker eggs are all female. Worker Bees are all female. The Male Bees are necessary for procreation with the Queen Bee. The Workers are all responsible for the work in the hive. The Queen Bee gives leadership to the hive. She is the most important in the hive. She has a scent and directs activity with that scent. She provides guidance with this scent. She lays around 350 – 700 eggs in the hive daily. But male eggs are not laid every day,” explained Jayathilake
These Worker bees can be further divided into more categories.
Nurse Bees are responsible for creating the Royal Jelly which is given to the larvae.
· Another type bring water
· Another type collect honey
· Another type creates wax
· Another is for protection
· Another collect pollens
· Another control temperature
“This Royal Jelly is given as food for the larvae. If it is given for five days, a Queen is formed. If it is given for three days a worker bees if formed. The Queen engages in copulation only once, with one or two males in the sky. After copulation she returns to the hive and starts laying eggs. She copulates with the strongest and only once in a lifetime. The life span of a Queen Bee is around three years. Even though she lays male eggs, when Males are not necessary, she does not lay Male Eggs. The Lifespan of a Male is two months,” pointed out Jayathilake.
There are three stages in a community.
· Growth Stage
· Honey Stage
· Dearth Stage
“If human beings want to obtain a community, the Growth Stage is the ideal time. This is normally from January to April. The growth stage is when more honey is brought into the hive by more bees. More pollen is also brought in. This is the stage when more honey is stored. Bees will even travel 700m to find the honey. The honey is for their food and what they store in excess is what human beings want,” added Jayathilake.
Of course when the population in the hive increases, the hive divides, because there is no space in the hive. During this growth stage Queen Cells are made by the Queen Bee. This is in order to make a new Queen Bee. When the new Queen emerges, the old Queen leaves the hive with a number of workers.
Procedure
“When we want to keep Bee Honey Boxes we must follow a certain procedure. Firstly a hive is taken from the tree and placed in a box. The box will contain eight wooden frames. With the passing of time a comb is created in the wooden frame. So during the growth stage we need to monitor this box. We need to take the wooden frames out, one by one and look for the Queen Bee and Queen Cells. When we spot Queen Cells and the Queen Bee we need to divide them into two separate communities.
We take the frame containing the Queen Bee and three other frames and transfer them into a new box. The new box then has four frames. Then we add another four to complete. And then the two communities will start to grow, with new cells being created, new eggs being laid and the comb will be created,” explained Jayathilake.
This is done so we can obtain more honey by creating two separate communities.
“At the honey stage we can harvest the extract by getting the honey combs from the wooden frames. Then comes the Dearth Stage. This is the rainfall time and since there is no food we can provide a mixture of sugar and water as food. So then the Queen can lay her eggs,” summed up Jayathilake
