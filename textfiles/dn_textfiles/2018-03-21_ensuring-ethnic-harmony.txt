Ensuring ethnic harmony

Sri Lanka has gone through a very difficult 30 years which saw a devastating conflict that tore the communities apart. It was a conflict that pitted brother against brother, sister against sister. The combatants were all Sri Lankans, except for the fact that they spoke two different languages. Hence the term “ethnic divide”.
There are different views on the origin of this conflict, but the most common perception is that ethnic discrimination of a particular community led to it. This was partly a result of various actions by extremist politicians who stoked ethnic ambers for their own political gain. However, every Sri Lankan paid a heavy price in the end.
Unfortunately, even after such a brutal conflict, lessons have still not been learned. It is clear that political elements starved of the oxygen of ethnic strife were behind recent attempts to inflame communal and religious passions in Ginthota, Ampara and Digana. Any attempt to destroy the unity between the Sinhala, Tamil, Muslim and Burgher communities in Sri Lanka could have far-reaching consequences especially at time when the country is just emerging from a dark chapter. The Government has prioritized ethnic reconciliation and peace building, but such sinister attempts could take the country back three decades or more.
Our goal now should be achieving ethnic reconciliation. There should no more room for ethnic clashes. This must be our resolution for today, The International Day for the Elimination of Racial Discrimination. Every person is entitled to human rights without discrimination. The rights to equality and non-discrimination are cornerstones of Human Rights Law. Article 1 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (which turns 70 this year) states that all human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights.
Yet racism, xenophobia and intolerance are problems prevalent in all societies, and discriminatory practices are widespread, particularly targeting migrants and refugees. States are being urged to take comprehensive measures to combat racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance, and to promote tolerance, inclusion, unity and respect for diversity.
This day marks the brutal killing of 69 people at a peaceful demonstration in Sharpeville, South Africa, on March 21, 1960, against the apartheid "pass laws". Since then, the apartheid system in South Africa has been dismantled. Racist laws and practices have been abolished in many countries, and there is an international framework for fighting racism, guided by the International Convention on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination.
However, racial and ethnic discrimination still occur on a daily basis in many countries, hindering progress for millions of people around the world. Racism and intolerance can take various forms — from denying individuals the basic principles of equality to fuelling ethnic hatred. The struggle against racism is thus a matter of priority for the international community.
The theme for this year is “Promoting tolerance, inclusion, unity and respect for diversity in the context of combating racial discrimination”. This is especially important in the context of the rise of extremist and far-right groups in many countries which have virtually called for an end to immigration and by extension, ethnic diversity. People in multi-ethnic and multi-cultural societies such as ours must learn to tolerate each other’s beliefs, traditions and languages. This should start from schooldays – Sri Lanka is moving in the right direction by teaching Tamil to Sinhala students and vice versa. When everyone can speak and understand all vernacular languages plus English, most, if not all, misunderstandings can be cleared.
Thanks to such efforts, there is every chance that at least 3-4 decades from now, no Sri Lankan will harbour ill thoughts towards another Sri Lankan because everyone will think he or she is a Sri Lankan first. Such a Sri Lankan identity has eluded us so far – even many official forms still have a field for one’s ethnic community, whereas “Sri Lankan” should suffice. Many other countries in our region such as Singapore have moved ahead of us as they have risen above ethnic labels. We hope that the new Constitution in the making will address this issue.
In the meantime, there should be strict punishments for hate crimes and hate speech that can incite racial troubles. The likes of Facebook have been used to propagate hate and animosity among ethnic and religious communities here and abroad. The Government took the correct decision in temporarily blocking access to certain social media in the wake of unrest in several areas, but now they are back online. Everyone should use these media with a sense of responsibility, since the Government and/or Facebook etc cannot monitor the contents 24/7. Now is the time to unite for the sake of the future generation, who should inherit a peaceful nation.
