Bodu Bala Sena (BBS) General Secretary Ven.Galagodaatte Gnanasara Thera surrendered to the Fort Magistrate’s Court yesterday morning. Court on Monday issued a warrant for the Thera’s arrest as he failed to appear in Court in connection with two cases filed against him. However, the Fort Magistrate recalled the arrest warrant yesterday after the BBS General Secretary surrendered.
