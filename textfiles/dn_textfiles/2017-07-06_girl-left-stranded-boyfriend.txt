Girl left stranded by boyfriend

An 18-year-old female resident in Weliveriya was left stranded by her boyfriend after visiting Anuradhapura on pilgrimage.
Investigations revealed that the girl had visited the boyfriend’s house in Kurunegala to attend a funeral. After the obsequies, the duo had left to Anuradhapura on a pilgrimage. Arriving at Anuradhapura on July 4, the girl, accompanied by her boyfriend, had visited a salon to seek a hairdo. The hairdresser had demanded Rs. 6,000 as charges where upon the boyfriend had left, promising to withdraw the money from a bank ATM and never returned. As the boy failed to report back, the hairdresser had handed over the girl to the custody of the Anuradhapura Police.
Steps have been taken to hand her over to her parents after notifying them.
