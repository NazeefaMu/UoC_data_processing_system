Chinese national re-remanded till May 23

Colombo Fort Magistrate Lanka Jayaratne yesterday ordered a Chinese national who was arrested over an offence committed under Immigrants and Emigrants Act to be further remanded till May 23.
The Magistrate observed that the suspect cannot be released on bail without the Attorney General’s instructions. The Financial Crimes Investigation Department (FCID) had sent extracts of the investigation to the Attorney General for his advice and police are yet to receive the Attorney General’s advice, the court was informed.
The FCID initiated investigations following a complaint made by the director of Central Bank’s Financial Intelligence Unit of a deposit of over Rs. 950 million in a private bank in Sri Lanka. The suspect had come to Sri Lanka with another Chinese national for employment and both had engaged in gem business illegally. However, the Magistrate granted bail at the earlier hearing as the suspects pleaded guilty for those counts and ordered the FCID to file charges against the suspects. On the same day the Magistrate also banned the suspects from leaving the country.
The suspects were ordered to be remanded since they were unable to fulfill their bail conditions.
In this immigration case, the Magistrate refused to grant bail to the suspects and also ordered President’s Counsel Jayantha Weerasinghe, appearing for the suspects, to submit relevant documents pertaining to their residence in Sri Lanka. The suspects had allegedly kept passports of eight other persons in their possession. The suspects were also charged with preparing forged documents to stay in Sri Lanka.
The Magistrate yesterday allowed the FCID to record a statement from the other Chinese suspect for an illegal transaction under Prevention of Money Laundering Act No 5 of 2006.
