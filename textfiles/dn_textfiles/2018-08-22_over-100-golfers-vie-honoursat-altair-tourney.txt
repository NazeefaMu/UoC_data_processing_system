We have received over 75 entries and this has attracted most of the professional golfers in Sri Lanka and is the only open tournament that is played other than the Sri Lanka Open, Captain of the RCGC Avancka Herat said at a media press briefing at the 139 year old club.
Director of Altair Pradeep Moraes said that “Altair was particularly pleased to support this tournament, because it extends an opportunity to a wider segment of players to compete against one another, contributing to the development of the sport. It is open to the best players regardless of club affiliation and membership. Altair caters to those who seek the finest things in life and the sport of golf is one of them. Altair is therefore the perfect champion for a tournament of this nature.”The winner will be awarded the Altair Trophy and cash awards of over Rs. 600,000 will also be presented to the top 30 golfers of the tournament.
The RCGC Open Golf Tournament was inaugurated in 1970 and was open to all golfers professional as well as amateur. It is a true test of golf with four rounds of stroke play to determine the champion golfer of the tournament for 2018.
