CID NABS MAN WALKING OUT OF BIA WITH 20 KGs OF GOLD

The CID arrested a person who was attempting to smuggle 20 kilograms of gold from New Delhi to Sri Lanka yesterday morning.
The suspect had meticulously sewn the gold into his clothing and had managed to get through the scanners and Customs officers undetected, but had been arrested by the CID.
Finance Minister Mangala Samaraweera had received information that certain individuals were smuggling in gold with the help of Customs officers. He held a special meeting with Customs and CID officials, recently and sought CID assistance to nab these smugglers.
Accordingly, CID officers in plain clothes have already been deployed at the airport and port to detect such smuggling operations.
