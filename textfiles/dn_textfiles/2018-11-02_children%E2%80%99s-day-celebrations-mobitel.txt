Children’s Day celebrations with Mobitel

Children’s day was celebrated by the world over on October 1. Mobitel saw this day as a way to connect with the children and hosted a fair for children from rural areas at the Badulla Football Ground on October 6.
The event started off with the children invited to experience exciting rides, play areas and activities. The grounds were open to the general public, which resulted in an unprecedented turn out with families across Badulla being given access to a day of fun and happiness in celebration of the future leaders of the country.
This initiative carried out to benefit the underprivileged children of rural areas takes place annually. Nalin Perera CEO, Mobitel was chief guest at the event, distributed over 700 school bags as a token of appreciation to children present at the event.
Mobitel, with its tagline ‘We Care. Always’, embodies how as a corporate it cares about the lives of the country’s youth. Mobitel is focused on enriching the lives of the children who are the nation’s future, and believes in the importance of celebrating and empowering the future of the country.
