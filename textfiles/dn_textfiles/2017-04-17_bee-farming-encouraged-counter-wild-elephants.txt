Bee farming encouraged to counter wild elephants

People residing in areas where wild elephants are roaming in the Hambantota district will be trained in bee farming as it was found that wild elephants fear bees.
Initially, a selected batch will be trained, Agriculture Department Assistant Director Nalika Rupasinha said.
She said bee keeping will provide self employments as well as will keep away wild elephants. Hambantota District Secretary W.H. Karunaratna said an estimate for the project will be handed over to the SPC soon.
