He said that the main aim of this is to purchase ship from fishing boats allowing fishermen to remain in water for longer times. He said usually fishermen return to the land next day with their catch and return again in the night. “This is because they don’t have capacity to store fish. What we plan is to coordinate with them in med sea via GPS technology and but fish on the sea. By enforcing this plan the fishermen could remaining in sea for more days.”
“In addition to purchasing fish we also introduce a system to provide them essential provisions like food from our boat. An online payment scheme too is on the cards.”
