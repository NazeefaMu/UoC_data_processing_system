UTE conferred with Silver Service Excellence  Certification by Caterpillar

Caterpillar (CAT) conferred United Tractor & Equipment (Pvt) Ltd (UTE), Silver status for Q3 2016, for its continued exceptional service excellence and impressive performance.
UTE is part of the China-India region for CAT operations and its performance is noteworthy as it was one of only two dealers to receive Silver certification for the quarter among the other nine dealers for the region.
Caterpillar assesses its Dealers on an on-going basis - quarterly and annually - recognizing those who deliver benchmark levels of service. The company's service performance is evaluated constantly through 16 key performance indicators (KPIs) categorized into four different areas: customer satisfaction, service effectiveness, service efficiency and profitability.
UTE has been participating in the CAT Service Excellence Awards since 2014 and received Bronze in 2015. In a short span of two years, through ongoing commitment and continuously improved processes, UTE has demonstrated excellent progress to receive the Silver Award for its third quarter performance in 2016.
Commenting on this accolade, Prasan Fernando, Chairman, UTE said, “We are extremely pleased to have received a higher level re-certification from CAT as it demonstrates our continuous commitment to achieve the best possible results. Together with the entire team, we look towards driving our processes forward, building on the Silver status and aim for the ambitious Gold award in the future.”
Also contributing to the Award are 45 attributes with special emphasis placed on the company's culture and team behavior. Through regular feedback and evaluation, CAT conducts assessments and an annual percentage is assigned reflecting the company's scoring for these attributes.
“Through CAT's assessments, UTE has now achieved Silver status. CAT is a Fortune 100 company and as a developing Asian nation with a small market, we are very proud of this achievement. We have proven that we can maintain international standards and from among 300 dealers worldwide we have been recognised, bringing value for the country,” said Aravinda Jayasekera, General Manager, Product Support Services, UTE.
Elaborating on the path towards this achievement, Jayasekera noted that UTE's four-star level workshop which conducts CAT internationally recognised programmes, the state-of the-art training facility, placement of processes and constant monitoring of KPIs with responsibilities given throughout the structure, and inculcating a thorough understanding of service excellence in terms of CAT culture contributed towards the new certification.
“We have the best service workshop in the country for our industry. We have around 100 technicians and provide 24-hour service. We have a branch network of about six branches for heavy machinery and our technicians are sent islandwide. We cater to both Sri Lankan clients and those from overseas who seek our expertise. We have demonstrated that our facilities, technicians, the workforce and the vehicles are the best, and now recognised by Caterpillar as Silver level leadership,” said Jayasekera.
Noting the encouragement received from the company Jayasekera added, “In UTE, our management; from the CEO to the Chairman supports us. They have provided all the facilities, creating the environment to help us drive our people towards the goals and ensuring added value. That is one of the key success factors in UTE.”
