'Race 3 ' in 3D?

On Monday evening, Salman Khan sent the internet in a frenzy by hinting that the trailer of his next Eid release ‘Race 3’ might not be launched on May 15.
“Kal ka mujhe thoda doubtful lag raha hai,” Salman tweeted, refusing to divulge any more details.
If reports are to be believed, to ensure a larger-than-life experience, the makers of ‘Race 3’ are planning to release the film in 3D along with the usual 2D prints.
Directed by Remo D’Souza, ‘Race 3’ stars Salman, Jacqueline Fernandez, Anil Kapoor, Bobby Deol, Daisy Shah, Saqib Saleem and Freddy Daruwala. TNN
