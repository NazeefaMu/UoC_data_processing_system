Elections Commission focuses on empowering young voters

Empowering young and future voters is the key area of the 2017- 2020 strategic plan introduced by the Election Commission, Elections Commission Chairman Mahinda Deshapriya said.
He was addressing the 14th International Electoral Affairs Symposium held in association with the Elections Commission in Negombo yesterday.
Deshapriya said the youth are negative about politics and are frustrated as they feel that politicians ignore them.
“They have developed a view that politics was boring and complicated which did not act as an incentive to become involved. Manu youths, immaterial of their educational background, have lesser interest in voting. Empowering Young and Future Voters' is a key area," he said.
Deshapriya said the Election Commission has taken measures to enlighten the schoolchildren on democracy and universal franchise in collaboration with the Education Ministry in propagating Student Parliament at school levels.
He said steps must be taken at the national level to increase youth civic engagement.
The Elections Commission in collaboration with of National Youth Services Council and Youth Parliament is conducting awareness programmes among the youth about the franchise and democracy, he said.
