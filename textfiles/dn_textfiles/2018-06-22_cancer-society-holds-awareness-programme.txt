Cancer Society holds awareness programme

The 'World No Tobacco Day' which fell recently was commemorated by the Sri Lanka Cancer Society (SLCS) with the participation of schoolchildren of Sri Parakramabahu Maha Vidyalaya, Narahenpita, Colombo.
The objective of conducting the programme was to create awareness of schoolchildren about the importance of rejecting all kinds of tobacco products, including cigarettes and also about the risk factors involved in smoking.
The SLCS Public Education Committee has also decided to conduct cancer awareness programmes in rural and urban area educational institutions to cater to schoolchildren and school leavers.
SLCS, Public Education Committee chairperson Indrani Nanayakkara said the SLCS will focus on educating young children since children are the most vulnerable sector in society.
She said not only tobacco but betel and alcohol too lead to cancer.
She said 85 per cent of lung cancers are due to the length of time a person smokes and lung and oral cancer are the most preventable cancer if one gives up smoking.
SLCS Public Education Committee officer D.W.S. Jayaratne quoting National Cancer Institute statistics said a large number died of cancer last year and the majority of them were tobacco smokers.
He said cancer in Sri Lanka is steadily on the rise and recent statistics reveal that a large number of Sri Lankans died of oral, oesophagal, stomach, cervical and breast cancer every year,".
