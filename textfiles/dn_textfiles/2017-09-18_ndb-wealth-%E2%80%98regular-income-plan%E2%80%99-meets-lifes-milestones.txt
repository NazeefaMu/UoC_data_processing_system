NDB Wealth ‘regular income plan’, meets life's milestones

No matter the financial goals one aspires to, whether it is buying a home or car, or paying to educate one's children, a ‘regular income plan’ from expert financial planner NDB Wealth is one of the best options for true success.
NDB Wealth's ‘regular income plan’ allows the saver to withdraw a predetermined amount, at regular intervals, from an existing saving or investment account at NDB Wealth. These intervals can be monthly, quarterly and will be credited to your bank account on the date specified by you.
“Achieving a goal is incredibly satisfying and it is even better when you meet financial goals related to payments or income.
A Regular Income Plan takes care of it all,” said Christina Wesley, Financial Advisor at NDB Wealth.
Wesley added, “The Regular Income Plan from NDB Wealth can also help you with a variety of ongoing financial commitments, from paying your monthly insurance premium, or your kid's college tuition, to even securing your long term future by providing a steady retirement income.”
The Regular Income Plan is so flexible it lets clients take out a part of the capital as well as income you make from it or, alternatively, only withdraw the income made on investments, enabling capital to stay invested.
Visit the NDB Wealth website and utilise the “Auto Wealth Planner” function to custom design a plan that meets your financial goals. Or visit NDB Wealth at your nearest. It is also advisable to get advice from a NDB Wealth representative prior to finalising any plan, so you are aware of the amount of savings or investments needed to meet your required withdrawal.
