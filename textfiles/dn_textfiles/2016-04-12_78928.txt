Former Zimbabwe umpire Ian Robinson dies at 69

 
Former Zimbabwe umpire Ian Robinson died of lung cancer at the age of 69, in Harare on Sunday.
Robinson made his international debut as an umpire in the 1992 World Cup and his Test debut in Zimbabwe's inaugural match, against India in Harare, in October 1992. He officiated in 28 Tests, 90 ODIs and three World Cups - 1992, 1996 and 1999.
Robinson officiated seven of his 28 Tests in matches involving Sri Lanka. He was the neutral umpire for the two Tests played in Sri Lanka against Pakistan at P Sara Oval and Asgiriya in 1994. He began his umpiring career in 1975, and was appointed to Zimbabwe's first-class panel in 1978. In 2004, he was sacked by the Zimbabwe Cricket Union without being given a reason.
Apart from his umpiring duties, Robinson served as a ZCU board member for 14 years and an employee of the board for nine. He also served as the board's international cricket manager.
Robinson was appointed to the first international panel of umpires established by the ICC in 1994. In 2008, he announced his retirement from top-level umpiring to focus on his role as ICC Regional Umpires' Performance Manager (RUPM) for the Africa region.
