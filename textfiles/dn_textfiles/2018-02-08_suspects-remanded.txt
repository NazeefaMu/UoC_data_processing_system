Posting picture of Prabhakaran:
Suspects remanded

Two youths arrested on the charge of posting New Year greetings with the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) emblem and a picture of the former LTTE Leader Velupillai Prabhakaran on Facebook, were yesterday ordered to be further remanded till February 21 by the Colombo Chief Magistrate's Court.
The two suspects, Dinesh Kumar and Vijaya Kumar Vidusha, residents of the Ratnapura area, had been arrested by the Terrorism Investigation Division (TID), following a complaint that they had posted New Year greetings with the LTTE logo and a photo of Prabhakaran in a manner which damages the peaceful coexistence of different communities in the country.
Meanwhile, the court was informed that the Attorney General has recommended to institute legal action against the suspect under the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights Act, No. 56 of 2007.
