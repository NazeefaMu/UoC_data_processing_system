Charlie Brown to referee Havelocks-Kandy SC match

As highlighted in the Daily News last Friday, an overseas referee for the Kandy Sports Club vs Havelock Sports Club game. Charlie Brown from Singapore will handle the whistle on Sunday.
He is a top referee and has refereed in our soil earlier and the last was in the Sevens final. Charlie Brown grew up in Ireland and played rugby as a boy right up through high school.
As an adult and a passionate PE teacher, he became interested in working as a rugby referee.
He started refereeing in 2004 and has since refereed matches in America, P.R. China and other countries around Asia. Charlie joined CIS in 2012 and joined the Singapore Society of Rugby Union Referees. He was also appointed as a referee on the International Panel of Rugby Referees and refereed his first test match between Malaysia and Thailand. One can see today that there are lot of referees with different levels and abilities. I don’t think anyone is born to be a good referee. Everyone has their passion, which really helps a lot to develop their referee abilities. The best referees, I feel, are the ones who allow the game to keep moving, without being at the center of attention.
