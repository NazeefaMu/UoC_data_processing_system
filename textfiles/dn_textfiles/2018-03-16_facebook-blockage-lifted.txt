On President’s directive:
Facebook blockage lifted

The Telecommunications Regulatory Commission (TRC) lifted the temporary ban on Facebook with immediate effect from noon yesterday on the instructions of President Maithripala Sirisena.
The instructions came in the aftermath of a meeting between two officials of Facebook Inc. and Secretary to the President Austin Fernando at the Presidential Secretariat where the two parties reached a solid agreement to take prompt action to contain hate speech.
President’s Office Research and International Media Director Harendra Dassanayake told the Daily News that the Facebook representatives in writing agreed to improve their response mechanism and increase their response capacity on Sinhala and Tamil content.
“Facebook will set up a single point of contact operating round the clock for Sri Lanka. They agreed to increase their response time overcoming the time zone and language barriers,” he said.
Asked as to whether there will be filtering of social media content, the Director said “There won’t be any filtering, but it is important that people report of any abusive content that badly affects our country or community. When people report, there will be prompt action,” he said.
Dassanayake said the two parties, who took part in the meeting, agreed to have a follow up meeting to ensure progress.
“There was a very fruitful meeting. Facebook agreed to collaborate with the Government and take appropriate action when reported on the content that breaches laws of this country. Action will be based on Facebook’s Community Standards,” he explained.
President’s Media Division issuing a press statement yesterday noted that spreading hate speech on Facebook is an offense according to Sri Lanka’s laws.
The Facebook representatives were scheduled to meet Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe yesterday evening before they leave the country.
They have produced a document with regard to their future collaborations to Secretary Austin Fernando. Secretaries to the Law and Order Ministry and Telecommunications and Digital Infrastructure Ministry were also present at the meeting.
The President, who was on a visit ton Japan, instructed to lift the Facebook ban after being briefed on the outcome of the meeting. “On my instructions, my secretary has discussed with officials of Facebook, who have agreed that its platform will not be used for spreading hate speech and inciting violence. As such, I instructed TRCSL to remove the temporary ban on Facebook with immediate effect,” he tweeted in his official account.
A temporary ban on several popular Social Media Networks including Facebook, Whatsapp and Viber was imposed on March 7 in the wake of communal tensions in the country. The restrictions on Viber were lifted on Tuesday midnight and Whatsapp on Wednesday midnight. Facebook ban, which continued for nine days, was lifted around 1 pm yesterday.
The law enforcement authorities were of the view that the temporary restrictions on social media helped them to quell the communal tensions and restore law and order. The PMD in its release said the Government apologies for the inconveniences faced by social media users due to the temporary ban.
