WHO team to discuss mental health issues here

A special World Health Organisation (WHO) team is scheduled to visit Sri Lanka in October or November this year. The WHO team plans to have a dialogue with the Cabinet Ministers on improving the mental health of Sri Lankans, Health Services Acting Director General Dr.J.M.W. Jayasundara Bandara said.
According to Dr.Bandara, Sri Lanka’s health indicators such as maternal and infant mortality rates etc are close or are on par as health indicators of developed countries but Sri Lanka is not doing well when it comes to mental health.
“Earlier, the suicide rate in Sri Lanka was among the highest in the world,but,now it has gone down to a certain extent,” he added. Meanwhile, Mental Health Unit Director Dr. Chithramali De Silva said the media, especially the electronic media should act responsibly when it comes to interviewing flood victims who lost all family members to floods or who faced similar disasters because forcing them to remind their bitter experiences can cause severe psychological damage to them.
“Many people who were affected by natural disasters suffer mental trauma when they return to their homes. Their needs should be looked into. Otherwise, they face severe mental disorders at a later stage in their lives. We have to give them a patient hearing,” Dr. Bandara said. Health staff working in the affected areas also need mental relief to overcome stress because they work under very trying circumstances.
Their mental well-being is very important. Journalists should not risk their lives when reporting disasters. “They too can suffer by stress,” she said.
