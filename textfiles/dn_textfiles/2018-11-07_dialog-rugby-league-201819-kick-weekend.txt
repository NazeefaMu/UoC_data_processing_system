On completion of the second round of the 2018/19 tourney, a new format would include the participation of foreign players and a ‘Dialog Super Round’ which would include eight games over two weeks of play. The top four teams of ‘Dialog Super Round’ would then proceed to play for the Cup Championship, while the bottom four would fight it out for the Plate Championship.
Tournament points earned up to completion of the second round will be carried forwarded to the “Dialog Super Round’. The teams ending up with the highest points will be crowned as the Dialog Rugby League Cup Champions and the Dialog Rugby League Plate winners. The 2017/18 season saw Kandy put on a powerful performance to edge out Colombo favourites Havelock’s SC to retain the championship and prestigious Clifford Cup Knockout Tournament for the fifth consecutive year. This is Dialog’s seventh consecutive year in connection with the League and Clifford Cup knockout competitions which see a passionate following among the young and old in Sri Lanka.
