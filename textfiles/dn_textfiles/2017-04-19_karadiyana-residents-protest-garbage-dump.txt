Karadiyana residents protest garbage dump

 
Residents in Karadiyana have staged a protest today against Colombo waste being dumped in Karadiyana.
The demonstration by the Karadiyana residents has hampered traffic in Wehera and motorists were directed to alternate routes.
The government decided yesterday that garbage from Colombo, previously dumped at Meethotamulla, would be taken to sites in Karadiyana and Dompe. The Kesbewa Magistrates’ Court granted permission for 350 metric tons of garbage per day, to be dumped at Karadiyana.
Residents however are against the move, claiming the project would cause inconvenience to them.
