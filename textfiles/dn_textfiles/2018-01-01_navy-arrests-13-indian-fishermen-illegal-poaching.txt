Navy arrests 13 Indian fishermen for illegal poaching

The Sri Lanka Navy arrested 13 Indian fishermen poaching in Sri Lankan waters, northeast of Katchativu Island, yesterday.
A fast attack craft attached to the Northern Naval Command arrested the 13 fishermen, along with two trawlers, for engaging in illegal fishing in the Sri Lankan territorial waters northeast of Katchativu Island yesterday morning, a Navy spokesman said.
The arrested fishermen were brought to the naval base SLNS Uththara in Kankesanthurai. Meanwhile, the trawlers had been taken to SLNS Elara in Kareinagar. They were handed over to the Assistant Fisheries Director of Jaffna for legal action, he added.
