Minister promises to grant demands of Graded Doctors’ Association

All demands coming from the Graded Doctors’ Association to ensure the professional rights of all medical practitioners, will be duly granted, Minister Rajitha Senaratne yesterday said.
Minister Senaratne also said that all the facilities doctors are entitled to have will be provided completely by the end of next year. He also said matters relating to these facilities will be answered in due time as well.
Minister Senaratne was participating in the annual general meeting of the GDA which was held at the Sri Lanka Foundation Institute yesterday.
Minister Senaratne also said the doctors’ salary should be increased so that none of them will seek foreign employment.
Minister Senaratne also said he will personally mediate if any doctor finds difficulties in enrolling his children into schools. He also said that the Government Medical Officers’ Association is more interested in politics than being concerned of their colleagues’ welfare.
Minister Senaratne said he comes to the defence of the President and the Prime Minister whenever accusations are directed towards them, as a way of securing the Yahapalana government.
Minister Senaratne pointed out the GMOA who accused the Prime Minister of the country to be mentally unstable, later on participated in a meeting held with Primer Wickremesinghe.
Meanwhile, the Graded Doctors’ Association requests Minister Senaratne not to elect the GMOA supported Dr. Palitha Abeykoon who is the Chairman of the National Authority on Tobacco and Alcohol (NATA) as the replacement to the post of SLMC President.
