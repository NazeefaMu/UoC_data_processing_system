SEUSL closed indefinitely

The Akkaraipattu Magistrate ordered the South Eastern University of Sri Lanka (SEUSL) to be closed indefinitely, yesterday noon.
The decision was taken due to continued protests made by students gathered at the administrative building of the institution, demanding an end to the investigations being conducted into recent ragging incidents.
All students and staffers were told to vacate the premises by 4.00 pm and any individual who were to remain in the institution past that time would be handed over to the police, SEUSL Registrar H. Abdul Saththar said.
