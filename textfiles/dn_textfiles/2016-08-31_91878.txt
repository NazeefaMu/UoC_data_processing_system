UNP to decide post revisions on September 6

The UNP Working Committee will decide on the revision of posts within the party when it meets on September 6, UNP MP Edward Gunasekara said.
He was addressing a press conference at the Sirikotha Headquaters yesterday.
He said a series of events have been organised from September 3 to 6 to mark the UNP’s 70th anniversary. Gunasekara said the Working Committee meeting scheduled at 6.00 p.m. on September 6 with the participation of all MPs is one important event among them.
He said a meet up between UNP representatives and foreign representatives and heads of other political parties has been organised at 7.30 p.m. on September 9 at Waters Edge. The MP said President Maithripala Sirisena would be a special invitee at this event.
He said the UNP convention would be held on September 10 at Campbell Park with the participation of a massive crowd.
Gunasekera said multi - religious activities and a UNP membership promotion programme have been organised parallel to the anniversary. Those include an alms giving to 70 Buddhist monks at Sirikotha on September 5.
