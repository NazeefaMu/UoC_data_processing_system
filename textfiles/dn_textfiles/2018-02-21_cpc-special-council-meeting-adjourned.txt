CPC Special Council meeting adjourned

The Second Special Council meeting of the Central Provincial Council (CPC) was adjourned with no issue of public importance being discussed.
The members, instead of choosing to discuss various issues affecting the province chose to speak on the recent Local Government elections and the performance of various political parties.
Close to Rs.400,000 was spent each time the council meets so that its members can resolve issues faced by the people of the Central Province.
The members who convened yesterday's meeting spoke of the Local Government elections until 1.20 p.m. and it was thereafter adjourned by Chairman L.D.Nimalasiri to March 6, due to a lack of quorum.
Ten UPFA members who supported the SLPP, came to the council holding Lotus buds and spoke of the election until the council was adjourned.
