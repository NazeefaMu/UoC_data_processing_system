E M Wijerama Endowment Lecture of the SLMA 2015
INTELLIGENCE AND ITS RELEVANCE TO MEDICINE

Sri Lanka Medical Association (SLMA) hold its Foundation Sessions annually to commemorate E M Wijerama who donated his house to the SLMA. His house now serves as the headquarters of the SLMA. Dr Sunil Seneviratne Epa was invited to deliver the EM Wijerama Endowment lecture of 2015. The speech delivered at the Anuradhapura Hospital Auditorium in the presence of a large gathering of doctors and academics from Rajarata Medical Faculty exhibited a new dimension connecting our religious beliefs and science.
Albert Einstein said, “The intuitive mind is a sacred gift,and rational mind a faithful servant. We have created a society that honours the servant, and forgotten the gift”. My speech today is on this intuitive mind. Purpose of my lecture is to show you the vast potential of this intuitive mind and how best we can put it to good use. Emotional and Spiritual Intelligence is a function this intuitive mind. Some people refer to this intuitive mind, as subconscious mind. According to some classifications, as much as 88% of our mind is subconscious. What is Intelligence? A simple way to understand this abstract term, is to think of it as an ability to apply Skills. We now have a definition of Intelligence which is as follows.
“Intelligence is the ability to apply appropriate skills, at right time for right purpose.” We have different four types of intelligence. a) Physical b) Cognitive c) Emotional d) Spiritual. If we are to place them in a pyramid, Physical intelligence is at the bottom and is the most basic level. Next is the Cognitive and above that is Emotional, and Spiritual intelligence is at the peak and is the highest form.
Traditionally, the Cognitive intelligence or Intelligence Quotient (IQ)is what we have been referring to as intelligence, at least up to few decades ago. However this trend is now fast changing. Over the years, we have realized that after reaching a certain level of IQ, there is no direct correlation between IQ level, and the actual achievements or success in life. The concept of Emotional intelligence or EQ, emerged as an explanation to this observation. Emotional Intelligence, basically means how skilled you are, in handling emotions, your own or other peoples’ emotions. EQ is defined as follows.
“Ability to make healthy choices based on the ability to recognize, understand and manage, your own feelings and feelings of the others”.
Leadership training
Daniel Goleman described EQ as a combination of four different skills under two groups. a) Ability to recognize your own emotions (Recognition) and control them (Impulse control). b) Ability to recognize other peoples’ emotions (Empathy) and ability to manage them (Soft skills or Social skills). One may be good at one skill but may be poor in another, So if we are to improve our EQ we need to know in which respect we are weaker. EQ can be enhanced by training and as a result it is now a big industry in the US. Studies have shown EQ level is directly related to success in business. Being a good doctor too means having good EQ. Empathy or the ability to understand another persons emotions, is a valued trait for success in medical profession too.
We are dealing with a special category of people with emotional needs. Leadership training essentially means developing good EQ. You may have heard of Gut feeling. This is the feeling based on perception rather than on rational thinking. This is a function of EQ. A surgeon may use his gut feeling whether to operate or not, on a bad patient.
Conventional thinking has been,that emotions are produced by what are called emotional peptides in brain. So it was a chemistry that we talked of. There is however now newer evidence, that these peptides once get attached to the cells, cause a vibration in the cell membranes, producing energy waves with different frequencies. So we are now talking of physics of emotions,producing measurable energy waves with different frequencies.
This brings us to a totally new topic, Cell vibrations. In fact the body is a bundle of energy in constant vibration producing a measurable energy frequencies. Nikola Tesla, who is considered to be the father of electromagnetic engineering said, “Everything is vibration and everything is energy”. Different emotions have different vibration frequencies ranging from 20- 700 plus Hertz. Negative emotions such as fear anger have lower frequencies while positive emotions such as peace and joy have the highest frequency.
Spiritual activities
Empathy is the ability to perceive another persons emotions. Secret of empathy my lie in the energy waves of emotions. So it looks,we now have a scientific basis for explaining Empathy – the ability to perceive another person’s emotions. How strange? You may have heard of people who can read other peoples’ minds. This may be the secret of that too. These emotional vibrations producing energy waves may explain the mechanism of transfer of merit or blessings on to another person by us performing spiritual activities. This is totally a new dimension connecting spirituality with science. Isn’t that strange again?
Spiritual Intelligence (SQ) is a kind of extension of EQ and is the highest form of human intelligence. We have a definition of Spiritual Intelligence too.“It is the ability or the skill to behave with Compassion and Wisdom while maintaining Inner and Outer peace regardless of circumstances”.
When people were asked to name a person with these qualities utmost, majority of them thought of their respective religious leaders. I think this is how, the term “spiritual” came to be coined with this highest form of intelligence. This inner peace component is what distinguishes SQ from EQ. In EQ we are not talking so much about inner peace. A sales man with high EQ may recognize an angry customer and may respond appropriately to calm him down and may succeed in maintaining outer peace. But he may not feel inner peace in himself during this process.
As one progresses from Eq to SQ, the person becomes skilled in maintaining inner peace too. How do you recognize people with high SQ? Essentially, they are calm, peaceful, compassionate people. Such people have less stress and conflict both at work and at home. They have better health and better output of work at work places. SQ too can be enhanced by way of training.
We can learn compassion by following the teachings of our religious leaders. Wisdom is a state of heightened inner awareness or tranquility of mind.
It is some thing you need to develop and acquire on your own. Meditation is one way of doing that.
There is now enough scientific evidence to suggest that meditation calms down the conscious brain and reduces ego. It is the ego that makes us lose our inner peace in conflict situations. Functional MRI Scan of brain during meditation has shown that activity of conscious brain and of the limbic system is reduced during meditation. Wisdom dawns as ego becomes thinner.
Ultimate aim of any human being should be to reach the peak of intelligence pyramid or to acquire SQ before death. How do we do that? All we need to do is to change the way we think of our own minds. Let me conclude by repeating what Einstein said,
“The intuitive mind is a sacred gift and rational mind a faithful servant. We have created a society that honors the servant and forgotten the gift”.
I leave you pondering how apt it is, what Einstein said over 100 years ago, in our present context today.
