Mini tornado destroys factory

A mini tornado hit a factory in the Palawiya Industrial Zone, Puttalam on Wednesday, destroying the premises, the Puttalam Disaster Management Unit said. According to eyewitnesses, the tornado hit the factory around 2 pm.
The workers said they “saw the wind blowing with a loud sound and suddenly the roof flew off from the building while the concrete columns broke down.”
The workers had left the site for lunch when the incident happened. The roofing sheets were blown off by the tornado for about two kilometres away from the building, the witnesses said.
The Puttalam Disaster Management Unit rushed to the scene and took a record of the loss caused by the damage.
