Wanna experience Picket Republic?

If you step into the Lionel Wendt on the evenings of December 16 and 17, you’ll be walking into a tumultuous outburst of youthful energy, and a theatrical experience like no other. Picket Republic is a satirical theatrical representation of everyday life on the Pearl, brought to you by an enthusiastic cast of nearly forty thespians.
The play is a collection of scenes typifying our island mentality, that uses a story similar to the Wizard of Oz to get its point across. The play is bilingual, including scenes both in Sinhala and English, and a good dose of “Singlish” added in for good measure. The audience will no doubt be captivated by the accurate depictions and satirical takes that they will see on stage.
The theme of Picket Republic is of course evident in the title itself. The picketing culture now prevalent in Sri Lanka is one that none of us can escape, and indeed, it seems to have become the “go to” vehicle for any form of social unrest. Strikes and rallies are a dime a dozen, and seem to spring up at the drop of a hat. The psychosis leading to this phenomenon is the main topic explored in the play.
It’s a heady mix of neocolonialism and nationalism, the tug of war between a nation’s search to establish its identity, which is plated up in a palatable, comedic form for your viewing pleasure. Negativity and fear of “the other” may be the manifestations of these processes, and there is indeed no better time than the present to investigate the ebbing and flowing of these forces within this tiny nation.
At a time when a new brand of thinking is necessary, it is heartening that a youth group such as the one behind Picket Republic have made it their mission to look beyond racial dynamics and nationalist motives, to the underlying humanity of all the citizens in this country. They will entertain you, and they will also challenge your perceptions at the same time.
If you are a fan of stage theatre, and want to see a laugh-out-loud, homegrown political satire based on these uncertain times, then you only have two days in which to get your fill of the last theatrical production to go on the boards of the Lionel Wendt for 2017. Be there on 16 and 17, from 7.30 pm onwards, or at the matinee show on December 17 at 3.30pm.
