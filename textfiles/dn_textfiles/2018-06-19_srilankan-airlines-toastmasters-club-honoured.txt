SriLankan Airlines Toastmasters Club honoured

The SriLankan Airlines Toastmasters Club was honoured with multiple awards at ‘Ovation 2018’, the Annual Conference of Toastmasters International District 82, held at the BMICH recently, including the prestigious ‘Golden Gavel Award’ and ‘Quality Club Award’.
This is a turning point in the history of the SriLankan Airlines Toastmasters Club, as it was the first time that the club was honoured with awards on this scale. At this year’s conference, only seven corporate clubs in Sri Lanka were honoured with the ‘Golden Gavel Award’.
The club’s President Gayanika Gunasekera and Executive Committee led the club to achieve the President’s Distinguished Award as well. During 2017/18 SriLankan Airlines Toastmasters excelled in the areas of Club Quality and Club Engagement, achieving a laudable 89% performance that was well above the 85% required for the award. Toastmaster Kamal Deepashantha of the SriLankan Toastmasters Club received the Distinguished Toastmaster (DTM) Award, the highest educational award in Toastmasters Communication and Leadership Track.
SriLankan Airlines Toastmasters Club was launched in 2002 as the only the 4th Toastmasters Club in Sri Lanka and the second corporate club in the country. Since that time, the club has produced Speech Contest Winners, Area and Divisional Officers and Educational Award Winners.
Among the club’s activities this year was a ‘Speechcraft’ programme at the Sri Lanka Institute of Tourism & Hotel Management (SLITHM), where a new Toastmasters Club was chartered with the sponsorship of SriLankan Airlines Toastmasters.
SriLankan Airlines, a member of the prestigious oneworld global airline alliance, operates a route network of 105 cities in 47 countries from its hub in Colombo and also connects to over 1,000 cities in 160 countries through its oneworld partner airlines.
