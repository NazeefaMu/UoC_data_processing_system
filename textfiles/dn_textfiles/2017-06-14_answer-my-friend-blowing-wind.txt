THE ANSWER MY FRIEND IS BLOWING IN THE WIND

War and violence around the globe seem to take its biggest toll now. Almost all the print and the electronic media are laden with the latest terror attacks and highly critical and philosophical essays. The readers and the viewers are kept abreast of time doing their entrusted duty to the hilt. In other words, peoples in every nook and cranny of the world are well-informed on the gravity of the ground realities related to war and violence.
‘The answer my friend is blowing in the wind’ naturally resonates in the mind of the literary lovers, especially the enthusiasts of the genre of war songs, in the 1960s because of the very reason that it was the theme song of the agitators against the Vietnam war, the worst war during that period we witnessed. It is an open secret who fuelled that human carnage and with what ulterior motives the battle went on for such a long time. It is the American university student community who took the vanguard to annihilate that war. In most of the instances, the voice of the university community proves to be intellectual unless it is coerced by disgruntled politicians.
Uncertain future
Escalating loss of human life, frightened running and the death of animals, incalculable loss of property, uncertain future, to cap them all, grave environmental catastrophe have fuelled an unformidable voice in the world to opine that time is high to draw a line between the war-stricken savaged the world that we live in at present a brave new world sans war and violence in the nations’ vocabulary. Unless a universal bloodbath would be very nigh. The writers around the world could render a yeoman service in this regard and our own writers could extinguish the burning flame and join that bandwagon and do the need of the hour without peaching hair splitting logics on national thinking whereas the intellectuals should essentially be internationalists. In the rapid globalisation process, our cultural identities would evaporate because of its heat.
In my literary endeavour to find a permanent solution to this chronic disease, the other day I perused through the immediately available poetic sources painstakingly for the with the sublime aim of leaving a better world for our posterity to live in. EUREKA, I found. I started jumping up and down in my storehouse of unimaginable treasures, my little home library. For the readers’ information, I would like to write what my eldest daughter domiciled in Australia has written at the very entrance of my little library: ‘Books are kings’ treasures’ – Ruskin.
Metaphorically, my daughter has made me a king!
Excitingly, for digressing your attention to a family anecdote, the writer would like to bring you a very pertinent and valuable piece of poetry as it seems timely to the modern world.
Hardcore terrorists
Wislawa Szymborska is considered in the literary circles as one of the prominent poetic figures who adorned the tapestry of English literature by writing poetry in her peculiar style of composing to reach into the very heart’s core of the literary enthusiasts. She was a multifaceted writer and for my endeavour here, I selected one of her poems on terrorism, in a sense, terrorism in the digital world. Yet, the hardcore terrorists still come forward to undertake suicide killings because of their bloodlust. Digital technology is widely and wildly used around the world for destructive purposes unprecedentedly and the writer would like to ring the alarm bells to the peace loving people to take utmost care, because if you spend your time at the wrong place at the wrong time, it would invite you to take the last breath as our veteran cricketer Kumar Sangakkara fluently put in records in his memorable Colin Cowdery lecture in England where the latest bombing took several lives.
She was awarded the coveted Nobel Prize in literature in 1996. She was Polish. She was born on July 2, 1923, and died in 2012. She inherited her patriotic feelings and charity towards the society from her father.
Her war experiences are very authentic and in her writing, it is candidly reflected. It is said that she had had terrible war experiences. In her most crucial period of childhood emotional development, she has had her early education in underground classrooms. The second world war added very bitter experiences to almost all the people everywhere in the world and this great poetess has laboured as a railway worker to earn a living in general and to evade forced labour in Germany, in particular. Her education was multi- dimensional and her poetry seems to be her forte. Her political leniency at the beginning had been towards socialism, yet she has alienated from that line of thinking with the passage of time. On her poetic career path, she was able to bag several prizes and win laurels.
In my poetic selection for this discussion, The Terrorist, He Is Watching, she gives us an accurate description of how a terrorist explodes a digital bomb very accurately and how he watches the explosion. He describes the movements of the general public staying at a very nearby place where the bomb is planted. Even the description is very exciting and this poem would open the eyes of the readers to be vigilant about the environment one life and walk about.
It is high time for all of us to educate the general public in this regard even though it is a thing of the past due to brave decisions our great leaders have taken and our battle-hardened militant leaders have executed them. It is a plural victory of the nation because people suffered a lot and sacrificed their comforts to see the light at the end of the tunnel.
Imminent tragedy
In order to get a life and blood experience, just imagine that we are at the very place where the tragedy is going to occur. The time, scheduled to explode the bomb, is thirteen-twenty. In our time, twenty minutes past one. Take utmost care. For God’s sake please behave as I tell you. Your valuable life is in my hand as said of the bus driver. I am monitoring the whole situation. We are near a liquor bar, look at that name board. You just check your time. It is thirteen sixteen.
‘The terrorist has already crossed the street.
That distance keeps him out of danger,
And what a view –just like the movies.’
It could be your common experience of watching movies. Being away from the place he seems himself detached from the imminent tragedy. There you see how he is watching the movements of the people in the vicinity and how he is counting from the very second. He is well protected from any harm, yet others do not know the precarious situation. In literary appreciation, we call it dramatic irony.
We should move a bit towards the other side to capture the full view of the situation, so please follow me. Now you can clearly see,
1.A woman wearing a yellow jacket is going into the liquor bar.
2.A man wearing dark glasses is coming out.
3. Some teenagers are having a big talk.
4. A short fellow is getting onto his scooter.
5. The tall man is going in.
Let’s lie down for our own safety. What is your opinion about the situation? I think only that short one will escape unhurt. See how the terrorist is counting the minutes. It is thirteen seventeen now. Please check it with your watches, because we have to move away before it goes off. The woman who entered the bar did not come out. So, her life is at severe risk. I think that the man wearing dark glasses will escape. This is a very exciting situation; yet please do not make panic. My assignment is to prepare a newspaper report. I bet that the tall teenager will definitely embrace death.
