National Cadet Corps celebrates 136th anniversary

The National Cadet Corps celebrated its 136th anniversary recently under the patronage of NCC Director Major General A.K.P. Wickramasinghe. A series of programmes were organized by HQ NCC in collaboration with the Rantambe Training Centre.
A flag-blessing ceremony was conducted at the Temple of the Tooth Relic at 6 pm on April 28. Adjutants of 38 Battalion and staff officers of HQ NCC and the Rantambe Training Centre marched with their flags to the shrine. Religious observances were conducted afterwards.
A ceremony commenced the next day with laying flower wreathes in tribute to the Unknown Cadet at the Rantambe Training Centre.
The Director was received at the main gate by a guard turnout. The Director, Deputy Director, Commandant, senior officers of HQ NCC, COs, PSI, coordinating officers of Tri-Services and cadets, paid floral tribute to the monument.
The Director was accorded with a guard of honour by a cross-section of cadets selected from the Assessment Camp in progress.
