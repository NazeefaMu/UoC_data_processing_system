EC to meet over Geetha ouster

Elections Commission Chairman Mahinda Deshapriya, confirming the receipt of Parliament Secretary General’s letter that the Parliamentary seat of Geetha Kumarasinghe has fallen vacant, said the Elections Commission would meet shortly and take appropriate action.
Speaking to the Daily News yesterday, the Chairman said the preliminary steps in this regard have already been taken. Parliamentary Secretary General Dhammika Dasanayake on Monday informed the Elections Commission in writing that the Parliamentary seat of Galle District MP Geetha Kumarasinghe has been annulled in line with the Court of Appeal verdict on May 3.
Upon receipt of this letter, the Elections Commission has to publish in the Gazette the name of the UPFA member who has received the next highest votes in the Galle district after Kumarasinghe. Former Minister Piyasena Gamage is the UPFA Galle district candidate next in line.
However, actress turned politician Geetha Kumarasinghe filed an appeal with the Supreme Court yesterday over the Appeal Court decision disqualifying her from holding the Parliamentary seat on the grounds that she was holding dual citizenship.
Elections Commission senior officer M. M. Mohemed told the Daily News that the Commission could go ahead unless there is a restraining order by the Supreme Court preventing the Commission from issuing the Gazette until the appeal is heard.
The Elections Commission headed by Deshapriya and comprising members Nalin Abeysekara and Prof. Ratnajeevan Hoole would meet shortly and decide on the future course of action. Deshapriya said the Commission hopes to make a collective decision in this regard.
