[APPRECIATIONS - (07-08-2017)]

Dedicated to Nandasena Ratnapala
We meet and we part
In this journey through Sansara
But the meeting or parting does not end with time or years
It's a long stretch of an eventful road
Where milestones matter more than rises or falls
We have travelled together on this hard and endless road
The journey was not smooth nor full of magical moments alone
But many achievements reached more worth than monuments in gold
Leaving a fragrance that would linger on and unfold
Gifting a memory of a life rich and rare
Now you are gone as you wished on a fateful morn
While family, students and friends remember and mourn
A warm tear drops none would see or feel
As I ponder about you, while memory unfolds your sight

Dr. Thilokasundari Kariyawasam
She was a marvel
It was during my time as a Teacher Educator at the Bolawalana Training College that Dr. Thilokasundari Kariyawasam was appointed Director of Teacher Training. I was a novice at the the time, not knowing how to handle teachers, especially of primary schools.
Dr. Kariyawasam started her activities by organizing several teacher education seminars. It was a quick programme; one in every three months. I attended all of them.
At that time, the 1984 reforms in education had to be implemented with new concepts. This was explained by her so well, basing her knowledge on Piaget's Development to Psychology.
She spoke so fluently in both Sinhala and English, without referring to notes. She was a marvel to listen to. She spoke with much practical experience as a teacher, principal and director. Teachers who understood the new concepts, as explained by Dr. Kariyawasam, got into the spirit of doing simple projects with children. They loved it and they learned to think independently, which is sadly neglected in today's education.
Thank you Dr. Kariyawasam for giving us such valuable guidance in teacher education.
May you attain the bliss of Nirvana.
