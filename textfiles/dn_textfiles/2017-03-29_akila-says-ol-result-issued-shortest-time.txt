Akila says O/L result issued in the shortest time

Education Minister Akila Viraj Kariyawasam said that moves were taken to issue the G.C.E Ordinary Level examination 2016 results within a short period compared to the previous years. He said that he is happy about it as it saves the valuable time of students. Owing to the delay of issuing results, it has been noticed, that students had to wait for a long period to receive the results.
The valuable time of students can be utilised to further their education when results are issued without delay. Having taken this situation into consideration, the Education Ministry took a policy decision to issue Ordinary Level examination results on March 28 from this year. The Minister said that he was informed by the Examinations Commissioner General that the pass rate of the Ordinary Level examination 2016 is higher when compared to previous years. It has been observed that the pass-rate in Mathematics is also high. “This can be considered as a fruitful indication of the quality improvement of the country’s education sector,” he said. The Minister said that 175,000 Advanced Level students and 28,000 teachers will receive Tabs under the first phase. The students, who qualify for the Advanced Level after passing the Ordinary Level Examination 2016, will also be entitled to receive Tabs.
