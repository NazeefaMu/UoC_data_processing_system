Sri Lanka dismantle Australia : Aus vs SL

 
Four wickets each for Dilruwan Perera and Rangana Herath, including a hat-trick, helped to dismiss Australia for 106 on the second morning of the second test against Sri Lanka in Galle today, leaving the visitors with a massive 175-run deficit.
Australia were dismantled for their lowest test total against Sri Lanka, losing their last eight wickets for only 52 runs.
Perera finished with 4-29, and Herath became only the second Sri Lanka after Nuwan Zoysa to take a test hat-trick. The spinner bagged 4-35 in the process.
Australia resumed their first innings on 54 for two, still trailing by 227 runs.
