Twelve hour water-cut in Kelaniya, Wattala on May 19

 
The National Water Supply and Drainage Board said today that water supply in Kelaniya and Wattala Divisions will be crippled from 9 a.m. to 9 p.m. on May 19.
The Water Board told Daily News Online that areas covering the Kelaniya Provincial Council, Peliyagoda Municipal Council, Wattala Municipal Council and Hendala Provincial Council will be affected.
The water-cut is due to repairs in two 900mm steel pipes, supplying water to the Kelaniya and Wattala Divisions, the Water Board said.
