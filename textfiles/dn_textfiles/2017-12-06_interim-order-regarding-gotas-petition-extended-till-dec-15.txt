Interim Order regarding Gota's petition extended till Dec. 15

 
The Court of Appeal (CA) further extended the interim order preventing police from acting against former Defence Secretary Gotabhaya Rajapaksa until December 15 under the Public Property Act regarding a Magistrate's Court inquiry, today.
The CA extended the Interim Order preventing police from acting under the Public Property Act against Rajapaksa, on Galle Magistrate’s court inquiry over a complaint that the D.A. Rajapaksa Museum and Memorial in Medamulana was built using public funds amounting to Rs.90 million.
On November 29, the Interim Order was issued on the basis of an ex-parte proceeding by a two-judge-bench comprising Court of Appeal (President) Justice L.T.B. Dehideniya and Justice Shiran Gunaratne.
This is pursuant to a writ petition filed by Gotabhaya Rajapaksa.
