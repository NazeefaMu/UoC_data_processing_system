We didn't deserve a semi-final place - Mathews

DELHI: Angelo Mathews, the Sri Lanka captain admitted that his team didn't deserve a place in the World T20 semi-finals because the way they played.
Sri Lanka, the defending champions were knocked out of the semi-finals when they lost their Group 1 match to England by 10 runs at the Feroz Shah Kotla grounds here on Saturday. The result was heartbreaking not only for Sri Lanka but also for South Africa who needed an England defeat to stand a chance of qualifying for the semi-finals. England qualified with West Indies from the group.
"If you look at the style we played we are not deserving of a semi-final place. The team didn't play well. That's why we lost," said Mathews at the post-match press conference. "We haven't been consistent enough. Our batting unit hasn't been consistent. They've performed well in patches. Playing in a tournament like this, you need to be performing consistently to go all the way. "We've gotten better in each and every game. Unfortunately the finishing touches weren't there. We've got a fairly inexperienced team but that's not an excuse. This is the big stage. This is the World Cup and we've all got to perform to go to the semi-finals," he said.
"In all three matches, we didn't give up easy victories, including against West Indies. In some instances we played poorly, but we didn't give the games up easily. I appreciate that - we fought a little. But then again, a loss is a loss. Whether you lose by a little or a lot, it makes little difference. We've lost two matches, and we won't be chosen for the semi-finals, but there are lessons from this."
As defending World T20 champions the Lankan team's performances leading upto yesterday's defeat was pretty ordinary. In their last 10 T20 internationals they had wins only against UAE and Afghanistan - two associate member countries.
"It has been a disappointing few months for all of us. We've let down the fans and we've let down the whole country. We haven't played good cricket at all. We're disappointed," said Mathews.
"All we can do is try and stick to our combinations and not try and change the team too much. Try to pick about 20 players and re-evaluate them over six months - give them an opportunity to settle down and see what they come up with in terms of performances. We can take decisions then. Quick decisions won't solve this matter. We have to try and be patient."
Reflecting back on the loss to England, Mathews stated, "Our plan in this match was to score a lot of runs in the first six overs, and lose no fewer than two wickets. Unfortunately we lost four wickets. After that it was difficult. Still, we could have won, but we lost that opportunity. England's fielding was very good. Those two catches - especially off Dasun Shanaka - turned the game. We will take some lessons from this, and we really need to develop in all three disciplines.
"After losing four wickets up front in the first six overs, it was a good comeback by the batting unit. At the end of the day we ended up losing and credit should go to the English team. We had nothing to lose after we were 15/4. We were running out of overs as well, so we had to get going. Myself and Kapu thought we would target a few bowlers - to try and get our eye in, in the first couple of overs, and then target a few bowlers. It worked, but unfortunately I didn't have a batter with me on the other side in the last couple of overs. It was a really good wicket."Mathews who pulled a hamstring muscle injury while batting, was virtually on one leg as he tried courageously to chase down the target of 172.
He finished unbeaten on 73, but the injury cast doubts on whether he could be fit for today's (Monday) game against South Africa.
"If I had another batter towards the end I could have given up a single and let the other one hit, but I couldn't really run as well. It feels pretty bad," said Mathews.
"My leg is not in a good state, I think. We'll see if I can play the next game. I will probably go for a scan with the physio tomorrow. As far as I know, it's not great. It feels like a tear. But the physio will assess it and let me know if I can play the next match or not."
