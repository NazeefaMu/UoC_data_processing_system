Prior to participating at international events:

Sportmen and women participating in international events should first get clearance from the Sri Lanka Anti-Doping Agency (SLADA) who will issue a certificate. All sports associations are expected to submit their athlete’s details one month prior to the international event.
This directive was made by Minister of Sports Faiszer Mustapha and the SLADA officially announced it at a press conference held at the Ministry of Finance and Mass Media auditorium yesterday.
Speaking at the press briefing the Sports Minister said, “We need to set up some system when it comes to an international event, and anti-doping clearance certificates is a must.
“We need to ensure our country’s reputation because of these anti-doping issues. Susanthika Jayasinghe was able to win a silver medal because the gold medalist was found guilty of doping.
“At the Ministry we are more concerned about doping because in rugby and weightlifting some sports athletes feel that if you used banned substances they can get good results. But on the legal side we are keeping a close eye on the doping problem because it can create huge issues. We should protect our future generation and wip e out the doping culture among the sportsmen and women ” the Minister said.
The Minister also conveyed his best wishes to the 15th Asia/Oceania Region inter government Ministerial meeting on anti-doping in sports.
The Sri Lanka Anti-Doping agency will be hosting the 15th Asia/Oceania Region inter government Ministerial meeting on anti-doping in sports for the first time on 18-19 June at the Kingsbury Hotel.
The event organized by SLADA is designed to promote, co-ordinate and monitor the fight against doping in sports. Twenty-eight countries including Sri Lanka out of 45 members countries will present their progress reports, for co-operation and partnership between the anti-doping organizations of Asia and Oceania.
Chairman of SLADA Professor Arjuna de Silva also shared his views at the press conference and revealed that there is a leading herbal syrup (Ayurveda Remedy) that has caused doping issues because it contains 8% to 10% percent alcohol in the herbal syrup. “It’s similar to alcohol percentages in a wine bottle. I’m telling this with scientific evidence,” de Silva said.
