India name squad for Australia ODIs

New Delhi: India on Sunday recalled pacemen Mohammad Shami and Umesh Yadav to the squad for the first three one-day internationals against Australia in the upcoming limited-over home series.

"The team for the three ODIs against Australia has been selected in line with the rotation policy of the Board and accordingly R Ashwin and Ravindra Jadeja have been rested," said MSK Prasad, chairman of the senior selection committee. AFP
