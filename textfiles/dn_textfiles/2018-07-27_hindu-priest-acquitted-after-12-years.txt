Hindu priest acquitted after 12 years

A Hindu priest who was held in remand custody regarding a case where five accused have been charged with aiding and abetting an LTTE suicide cadre charged with attempting to assassinate the former Defence Secretary was ordered to be acquitted and released from the case by the Colombo High Court.
The accused was acquitted and released from the case on the basis that there is no sufficient evidence against the accused to prove him guilty.
Colombo High Court Judge Sampath Abeykoon made this order following the findings that the confession made by the accused Sriskandarajah to the Terrorism Investigations Division was not made voluntarily. The Attorney General also admitted that apart from the questionable confession, there is no other evidence against the accused.
In this case, the Attorney General had filed indictments against five accused on charges of conspiring with the suicide cadre and assisting him to carry out the suicide bomb attack which killed two army officers and injured several others.The former Defence Secretary escaped unhurt.
A LTTE suicide cadre attempted to drive an explosive laden vehicle into former Defence Secretary Gotabhaya Rajapakse's motorcade at Pittala Junction in Colpetty on December 1, 2006.
