Certified price for maize

The Agriculture Ministry has decided to set a certified price for maize to boost the local production, Agriculture Minister Mahinda Amaraweera said.
The ministry plans set a guaranteed price of Rs. 43 per kilogram. The Cabinet paper in this regard is scheduled to be submitted within the next two weeks.
The ministry has taken several measures to encourage local farmers to engage in maize cultivation to produce 100,000 more metric tons of maize than the current production next year.
According to ministry statistics, Sri Lanka had imported 164,000 metric tons of maize in 2017 and the amount had increased to 200,000 metric tons this year.
The government will bear 50 percent of the cost of maize farmers spend for seeds.
A decision has also been taken to provide chemical fertiliser under the fertiliser subsidy programme of the government to maize farmers. Accordingly, maize farmers would be able to purchase 50kg bag of urea at Rs. 1,500.
The Agrarian Insurance Board will provide crop damage insurance for maize farmers free of charge. In the case of cultivation damage, Rs. 40,000 per acre or Rs. 100,000 per hectare will be paid as claim benefits.
