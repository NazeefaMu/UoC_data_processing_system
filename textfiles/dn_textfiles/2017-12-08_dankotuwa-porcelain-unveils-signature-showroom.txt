Dankotuwa Porcelain unveils  Signature showroom

Dankotuwa Porcelain, renowned for its luxurious and elegant porcelain tableware, unveiled its Signature Showroom, situated in the upmarket shopping precinct of Guildford Crescent, Colombo 07.
Located within walking distance of some of Sri Lanka's most visited landmarks, including the historic Independence Square and cultural icon the Lionel Wendt Theatre, Dankotuwa Porcelain's new luxurious store provides an upscale shopping atmosphere and unparalleled service unlike any other within the country.
The Signature Showroom displays the very best of Dankotuwa Porcelain’s fine Sri Lankan tableware and giftware, housing an array of modern and elegant products, thus giving consumers, hotel business partners and design professionals a hands-on opportunity to experience world class tableware exclusively from Dankotuwa Porcelain.
Taking visitors, both local and foreign, on a journey into Sri Lanka’s ceramics heritage, the Signature Showroom features a section on the history of Porcelain to educate customers about the “Dankotuwa” story as well as its association with the local pottery traditions. Pottery in Sri Lanka goes all the way back to 500 BC, when the first local potters manned their wheels and came up with elaborate, artistic designs, directly inspired by their unique island surroundings.
Speaking at the inauguration ceremony, the Chief Guest for the event, Rajan Asirwatham, Chairman of Dankotuwa Porcelain, said, “Our overall growth plan for 2020 includes several exciting initiatives such as this Signature Showroom aimed at taking the Group to new heights as a world class manufacturer of premium porcelain tableware. We are also in the process of transforming the Dankotuwa Porcelain brand, including adding in well-planned distribution strategies, to increase customer accessibility to Sri Lanka’s iconic porcelain brands.”
Dankotuwa Porcelain CEO Wasaba Jayasekara and his team have been working tirelessly to bring about the best offerings across a variety of segments, making this a truly international shopping experience. In fact, products on offer at the new Dankotuwa Porcelain Signature Showroom go beyond porcelain products, bringing in many complementary and supplementary offerings to delight customers.
The Signature Showroom brings to life the promise of design excellence and luxurious dining by consistently delivering a delightful shopping experience.
“Delivering a full-service shopping experience to our customers, and thereby helping them aspire to a higher quality of life, is what we are striving to achieve with the inauguration of the Signature Showroom,” commented Murali Prakash, Group Managing Director and CEO of Lanka Century Investments, the parent company of Dankotuwa Porcelain.
Prakash further noted, “Having launched Sri Lanka’s first lifestyle based porcelain store, encompassing not just retail shopping but also culture, Sri Lankans will now gain inspiring ideas and guidance for their very own luxurious dining experience.”
Dankotuwa Porcelain, a subsidiary of Lanka Century Investments PLC commenced its commercial operations in 1984.
