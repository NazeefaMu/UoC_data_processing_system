Leishmaniasis rears its head

The Entomology Unit of the Gampaha Provincial Health Director’s Office says that there is a possibility of the spread of leishmaniasis in the country. So far 23 leishmaniasis patients have been detected in the Gampaha district and last year 1,500 such patients were detected in Sri Lanka.
In the past, sand flies which spread the disease were found only in the dry zone in the Southern Province, but now the flies are also found in other areas such as Divulapitiya, Attanagalle and Meerigama.
Leishmaniasis is caused by the parasite Leishmania donovani. It appears in several forms. The most common forms are skin or cutaneous leishmaniasis, which causes skin sores, and internal or visceral leishmaniasis, which affects several internal organs (usually the spleen, liver, and bone marrow). It can cause ulcers in nose, mouth, or throat (which is known as mucosal leishmaniasis).
