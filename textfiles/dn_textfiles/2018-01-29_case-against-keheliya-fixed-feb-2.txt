Mobile phone bill payment with SPC funds
Case against Keheliya fixed for Feb. 2

The Colombo Chief Magistrate's Court yesterday fixed for February 2 to deliver its order on preliminary objections raised by former Minister Keheliya Rambukwella and former State Printing Corporation (SPC) Chairman.
This is regarding a case for allegedly causing an unlawful loss of Rs. 230,984 to the government after paying former Minister’s mobile phone bill using SPC funds, while Rambukwella was functioning as the Mass Media Minister in 2012.
The defence had raised preliminary objections regarding the maintainability of the charge sheet.
The Bribery Commission alleged that the former minister had induced the CPC chairman to pay his (minister's) mobile phone bill from March 15, 2012 to April 14, 2012 causing an unlawful loss to the government, while the minister was serving as the Mass Media Minister.
The Bribery Commission had named former (SPC) Chairman Jayampathi Bandara Heenkenda as an accused for aiding and abetting to commit the offence. The Director General of the Commission to Investigate Allegations of Bribery or Corruption filed this case against the former minister and former SPC Chairman under Section 70 of the Bribery Act on three counts.
Counsel Anuradha Siriwardena, the Assistant Legal Director of Bribery Commission, appeared for the prosecution. Counsel Niroshan Siriwardena appeared for the accused.
