Speaker’s chair overturns

The Speaker’s chair in the main chamber overturned unexpectedly, while Parliament sessions were in progress yesterday.
The chair turned over when the presiding members of the House were changing places. The incident happened while UNP MP Ananda Kumarasiri left the chair and UPFA MP Shehan Semasinghe was about take seat. Staff members rushed to the podium and straightened the chair back to its normal position.
Following the incident, UPFA MP Mahindananda Aluthgamage stood up and said that it was the first time the Speaker’s chair toppled in Parliament which was a bad omen.
The incident happened when the debate on Regulations under the National Medicines Regulatory Authority Act was in progress.
Semasinghe continued to preside the session for some time and thereafter when the next member to take the chair MP Edward Gunasekera came for his turn, staff members warned him to be cautious before sitting down.
