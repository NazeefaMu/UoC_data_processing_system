Distracted dining

Many of us like to relax with a box set and a bag of crisps.
But eating while watching TV or browsing Facebook can cause people to overeat, leading to obesity, a new study has found.
And parents being distracted means they do not pay attention to their children at the dinner table, so they don't learn healthy habits such as stopping eating when full.
Researchers said so-called 'distracted dining' may be as dangerous to health as losing concentration on a motorway.
The US researchers videoed 60 families during mealtimes to test the effects of distraction.
Half the families were subjected to the sounds of loud vacuum cleaner in an adjacent room for 15 minutes while eating, while the other families ate without a distraction.
During the meal, the team measured the family members' Body Mass Index (BMI), food consumption, action, behaviour and communication.
The effects of distraction were more marked for parents than for children.
Parents ate more biscuits and drank more soft drinks than the quiet group but they also ate more vegetables.
However, the noise had a big effect on communication between parents and their children.
Dr Barbara Fiese, of the University of Illinois, said: 'Adults got up and down from the table a lot more and made fewer positive comments.
'They paid less attention to their children's concerns in conversation and we know that kind of conversation is associated with a healthier weight in children.'
She added distracted parents are probably not monitoring what their children are eating and not demonstrating a positive interest in their children.
This means that children are not set good examples such as stopping eating when they are no longer hungry.
She said: 'Being distracted during meals puts kids at added risk for obesity and increased consumption of unhealthy foods.
'In this study, we found that noisy and distracting environments affected parents' actions and we know that parents set the tone for the quality of family mealtimes.
'If you're getting up and down because you're distracted during a meal, you're probably not able to pay attention to the kids' emotions or to model good responses to your hunger cues - noticing when you're full and not continuing to eat.'
This is the first time that distracted eating has been tested on whole family groups.
Dr Fiese said: 'We haven't really thought about what it means if adults, who are supposed to be regulating what's happening, are distracted during family mealtimes.
'It doesn't portend well for the family's eating habits as a whole.'
She added: 'This study shows that it's not enough to encourage families to eat together regularly without identifying other factors that promote health.
Distractions and disruptions may be part of a family environment that is habitually chaotic and unstructured.
'We know that children raised in chaotic family environments are at increased risk for becoming overweight or obese.'
The research appears in the journal Couple and Family Psychology.
