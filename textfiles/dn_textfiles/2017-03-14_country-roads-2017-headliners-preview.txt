Country Roads 2017 headliners preview

Country music and folk fans will be presented with a unique opportunity to check out 2017 Country Roads concert headliners as Keith Potger and Astrid Brook perform at a very special preview of the concert on the evening of Saturday, March 18, at the Terrace of the historic Mount Lavinia Hotel.
This year’s Country Roads concert, to be held on Sunday, March 19, at 6.30 pm at the same hotel, will encompass a number of related activities including this preview, a visit to the MJF Charitable Foundation and even a Rs. 10,000-a-plate dinner at the hotel.
“Wandering Ministrel” Keith Potger is a new addition to the Country Roads concert for children in 2017. He is globally renowned as a founding member of “The Seekers” from Australia, a band that first hit the UK charts in the 1960s.
UK-based folk singer Astrid Brook has become popular in Sri Lanka for her own unique covers of famous songs by Dolly Parton, Johnny Cash and Bob Dylan. This year, Astrid will debut a new cover of a famous song by John Denver. Said Astrid, “Just learned a new John Denver song for Country Roads Concert at Mount Lavinia Hotel. Beautiful song from a legend.”
Additionally, joining 2017 Country Roads concert headliners Keith Potger, Astrid Brook and the Mavericks Duo for a visit to the MJF Charitable Foundation in Moratuwa will be the always-entertaining Sunil Perera of Gypsies fame, as well as comedian Ronnie Leitch.
A tradition associated with the Country Roads concert since its 25th anniversary in 2013, the MJF Charitable Foundation visit is a fun and festive affair with performers playing well loved songs for the special needs children the charity serves. This year’s visit will no doubt be even more entertaining since the children now have Sunil’s legendary rendition of Pitikotapan Nona and Ronnie’s hilarious theatrics to look forward to.
The Country Roads concert is South Asia’s and Sri Lanka’s longest running concert series, currently celebrating its 29th anniversary, with all proceeds going to local children’s charities. Sponsors for 2017 include HNB, Dilmah, Cargills (Ceylon) PLC, Dialog, BBDO, LOLC, Official Airline SriLankan Airlines, Firefly, CPR and Gold FM while the Host Hotel is Mount Lavinia Hotel.
