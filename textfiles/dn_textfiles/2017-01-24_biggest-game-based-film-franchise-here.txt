The biggest game-based film franchise is here

Writer, director, producer and franchise veteran Paul W.S. Anderson returns to helm ‘Resident Evil: The Final Chapter’, the sixth and final installment in the most successful video game film franchise ever.
The improbable beginning of Paul W.S. Anderson’s fantastically successful, franchised motion picture adaptation of the Resident Evil video game reads like a Hollywood ending. Producer, Jeremy Bolt, who has worked with Anderson for 25 years and including all the Resident Evil editions, recalls, “Back in 2002 we had just made a movie for Warner Bros. called Soldiers, which did not perform as well as we’d hoped. So I went back to England and made a couple of small films, and Paul holed up in his house in Venice Beach where he played video games for 6 months. Out of the blue he called to say ‘I’ve been playing the game Resident Evil and we have got to get the film rights.”
Since then, Resident Evil has grown to become one of the most successful game-to-movie franchises in the history of cinema, the first five installments in the franchise having grossed in excess of $1 billion worldwide and earning consistent No. 1 openings at the box-office. Thrilling fans of Capcom’s original video game and action/sci-fi movie audiences alike, the movie franchise has built up a hardcore fan base in the millions and reputation of its own over the 14 years that it has enthralled audiences with cutting edge action and a continually novel approach to the sci-fi/action genre.
Bolt opines about the global success of the series. “I think it’s the combination of style action and horror. It isn’t a straight horror movie and it isn’t a traditional zombie movie. It has a fantastical, and Sci-Fi element. I think Paul introducing the character of Alice made it different to the game so that when you go see one of these movies you don’t just have to be a fan of the game to enjoy it, you get something extra which is the character of Alice. I think also we have a good villain in the evil and all-powerful Umbrella Corporation, it’s always a good villain to have that and totally relatable in the modern world.” Inquirer
‘Resident Evil: The Final Chapter’ is due to be released at Majestic Cineplex from February 2. It is a CEL release
