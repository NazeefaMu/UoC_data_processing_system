Robin and Rosy’s cub on display

A tiger cub which was born at the Dehiwala zoo last November will be on public display soon, a Dehiwala zoo source said.
The cub was born to tigress Rosy and tiger Robin.
Both tigers were imported to Sri Lanka from a zoo in China. The cub is well cared for by its caretakers Piyasiri and Anurasiri.
