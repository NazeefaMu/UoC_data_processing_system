Political trifles, naïve alliances and revealing revelations

President Maithripala Sirisena's sibling Dudley Sirisena, a businessman who often operates behind the scene when it comes to political matters, facilitated meeting between President Sirisena and former Western Province Chief Minister, UPFA MP Prasanna Ranatunga last week. The meeting was held at President Sirisena's personal residence at Paget Road.
The UPFA Parliamentarian, needless to say, is still a staunch backer of former President Mahinda Rajapaksa who is facing a surfeit of issues on the anti-corruption front. When the former President appeared before the Presidential Commission of Inquiry on Large Scale Corruption last week, Ranatunga was among the few SLFP MPs who accompanied him. It is in this context that the meeting between President Sirisena and Ranatunga can be interpreted as a significant development from the viewpoint of SLFP supporters.
At the meeting, which lasted for more than half an hour, the former Western Province Chief Minister urged President Sirisena to think twice before dissolving the UPFA coalition. He said the party should work with the UPFA at the forthcoming Local Government election and should give recognition for former President Mahinda Rajapaksa. He stressed both President Sirisena and former President Rajapaksa should work together to strengthen the party's campaign for the Local Government election fixed for early next year.
During the meeting with President Sirisena, Ranatunga also urged his party leader to protect himself from whom he termed as 'tale carriers' who have surrounded the President. He said such elements had already caused a great damage to the party.
President Sirisena, in response, did not explicitly say he would allow the party to work with the minor stakeholders of the UPFA. The President said he would "do the needful" to protect the unity of the party and strengthen the SLFP.
The Parliamentarian's meeting with President Sirisena suggests that the party is already in a state of confusion over the Local Government polls. Although the President has expressed willingness to lead the party's campaign for the Local Government election, the rank and file is doubtful whether the party will be able to achieve a significant victory at the election. It is obvious that the party's defeat at the Parliamentary election in August will make a debilitating impact on the SLFP campaign in March. It is in this context that the party is desperately looking for trump cards to turn the tables on the UNP, which will enter the electoral fray with a clear edge.
Meanwhile, eight political parties in the opposition are now holding discussion to contest the election as a new opposition alliance. The eight parties are minor constituent parties of the UPFA and they are of the firm belief that the SLFP will distance itself from the coalition before the March election. National Freedom Front, Pivithuru Hela Urumaya, Mahajana Eksath Peramuna, Desha Vimukthi Janatha Party, Lanka Sama Samaja Party, Communist Party of Sri Lanka and Democratic Left Front are the parties that are currently holding discussions to form an opposition coalition. They are already in touch with a group of SLFP MPs who are die-hard supporters of former President Mahinda Rajapaksa.
It would be questionable to some as to how parties such as the National Freedom Front and Pivithuru Hela Urumaya work could form an alliance with traditional left parties like the LSSP and the CP. While the NFF and Pivithuru Hela Urumaya demonstrate ultra - nationalist leanings, traditional Left parties push for devolution of power and a comprehensive political solution to the Tamil question.

"When working within a coalition, parties do not have to agree on all matters. We will have our ideological differences. But, we will work together with a common understanding when it comes to core matters," LSSP Leader Prof. Tissa Vitarana told the Daily News. He added that his party, while working within the framework of a leftist coalition with three other political parties, is also exploring the possibility of entering into a broader alliance with other political parties of the opposition.
It is now clear that the war crimes inquiry mechanism, suggested by the US and other member nations of the UNHRC, would be the main rallying point for the parties in the opposition striving to form a new alliance ahead of the election. While the NFF, Pivithuru Hela Urumaya and other ultra nationalist parties dub the domestic mechanism as an attempt to betray "war heroes", the old left parties claim the domestic inquiry amounts to undue interference by the US and other powerful western nations. This has allowed them to find a common ground where all eight parties could work together as an alliance in their battle against the government.
The SLFP, on the other hand, has extended its support to a local inquiry mechanism supported by international stakeholders such as the UN and Commonwealth. The UNP and the SLFP, two main partners of the national unity government, are on the same page about measures towards accountability and reconciliation in Sri Lanka. Therefore, there is a serious difference of opinion between the SLFP and other stakeholders of the UPFA over the war crimes inquiry mechanism.
Main objective behind opposition political alliance
It is naïve to believe that these parties are strong enough to field a formidable team that can pose a challenge to mainstream political parties at an island wide election. The discussion to form an alternate political alliance is nothing but a pressure tactic to prevent the SLFP from pulling out of the UPFA alliance. If and when the SLFP decides to go solo, it will plunge minor constituent parties of the UPFA into a precarious situation. Such a situation will compel the UPFA minor parties alliance to draw a section of SLFP MPs into the alliance. This group, in all probability, will be the section supporting former President Mahinda Rajapaksa. This will lead to a split in the SLFP before the Local Government election.
The SLFP MP group held a meeting with President Sirisena on Monday evening to discuss the party's plans for the Local Government election. At the meeting, the President said the Local Government polls would be held under the new electoral system. It was a strong indication that the Local Government election might get delayed a few more months, as the Election authorities are yet to finalize delimitation.
The SLFP think tank believes that delaying the Local Government election would be advantageous to the party as the President can use that 'interim period' to consolidate his power and strengthen the party. The President launched a drastic reform process in the party immediately after the Parliamentary election and consolidated his power in all key decision making bodies of the party. The SLFP top rung think that holding the Local Government election under the new electoral system would give the SLFP some additional time to tie up the loose ends of its machinery and to come out of the 'defeatist mentality' stemming from the party's defeat at the Parliamentary election.
President Maithripala Sirisena has entrusted Minister S.B. Dissanayake with the task of finalizing party reforms before the Local Government election. Dissanayake, who became a strong Maithripala loyalist after the Presidential election, is a person who has adopted a hostile approach towards minor constituents of the UPFA. Dissanayake's appointment as the 'competent authority' when it comes to party reforms is a strong sign that the party is drifting away from the UPFA.
Gammanpila - Dinesh - Prasanna - Bandula meet at Gamini Lokuge's house
Gamini Lokuge, MP
Meanwhile, several representatives from the opposition parties, including Udaya Gammanpila, Dinesh Gunawardena met with a group of SLFP MPs at MP Gamini Lokuge's house in Colombo on Monday night to discuss the way forward. The SLFP group included Lokuge, Bandula Gunawardena and Prasanna Ranatunga. At the meeting, they unanimously agreed that the SLFP should not abandon other political parties of the opposition when it comes to the Local Government election. However, the issue is the SLFP MPs who attended the meeting do not have significant national level responsibilities.
However, the group arrived at the agreement to hold 'balamandala' level meetings, across the country, to pressurize the party's decision-making bodies to work hand in hand with minor parties of the UPFA. It was somewhat similar to the plan they adopted to ensure nomination for former President Mahinda Rajapaksa to contest on the UPFA ticket at the Parliamentary election.
Pilleyan linked to three high profile murders?
Former Eastern Province Chief Minister Sivanesathurai Chandrakanthan alias Pilleyan has already been arrested in connection with the murder of former TNA MP Sivanesathurai Chandrakanthan. In addition to that, the investigations are underway into the disappearance of journalist Prageeth Eknaligoda and murder of Nadaraja Raviraj. Interestingly, evidence gathered by the CID so far points to a connection of some sort among the three cases.
Pararajasingham was shot at while attending a Christmas mass in 2005 in his hometown Batticaloa. Nadaraja Raviraj, an outspoken Tamil Parliamentarian, was killed in Colombo on November 10, 2006, and journalist Prageeth Eknaligoda, a vociferous critique of the previous government, was disappeared two days before the Presidential election in 2010.
The former TNA parliamentarian s murdered a day after he led a protest opposite the UN office in Colombo against the alleged death of 45 civilians in Vakarai due to bombings. Two persons on a motorbike shot at him while the politician was leaving his personal residence in Narahenpita. His bodyguard Lakshman Lokuwella also died in the shooting.
The CID made a significant breakthrough in investigations into Raviraj's murder when it arrested three Navy officers in March, over the matter. It was later revealed that the main suspect of the Parliamentarian's murder had fled to Switzerland. He was identified as Cheran, a person who worked closely with members of the Sri Lankan military.
The CID has now sought assistance from the Swiss government to arrest Charan who is presently in hiding.
Charan is said to be a close ally of the former Eastern Province Chief Minister Sivanesathurai Chandrakanthan alias Pilleyan. According to Police sources, the firearm used in the murder of Raviraj had been given by a military officer. The same officer, interestingly, came under investigation in connection with the disappearance of journalist Prageeth Eknaligoda too.
CID investigations revealed that the military officer in question had handed over the weapon to Pilleyan and subsequently Pilleyan had given it to Charan.
Four people have been taken into custody so far over the murder of Raviraj and two of them have agreed to become state witnesses.
In another development with regard to inquiries into Raviraj's murder, the CID, on Tuesday, informed Colombo Additional Magistrate that the Attorney General has given instructions to conduct a non-summary inquiry into the killing of the former MP.
Filing a further report before Colombo Additional Magistrate Nirosha Fernando, the CID informed that the non-summary inquiry into the incident is to be held in respect of six suspects including several navy officers.
The Court was further informed that the Attorney General has given instructions to conduct the non-summary inquiry within a period of two weeks and the suspects who had been out on bail were noticed to appear before Court on next hearing date.
The CID also told Court that they were yet to receive a DNA report in respect of the blood samples. Two suspects Prasad Hettiarachchi and Gamini Seneviratne, who were arrested in connection with the incident, were ordered to be further remanded till November 3 by the Additional Magistrate.
CID reaches breakthrough in investigation into Eknaligoda disappearance
Investigations into the disappearance of journalist Prageeth Eknaligoda also reached an important stage last week with the CID finding evidence to suggest that the journalist was killed a few days after his abduction.
The investigation teams have unearthed evidence to suggest that he may have been killed and dumped in the sea off Trincomalee, following his abduction in Colombo.
Police said Ekneligoda may have been taken to a camp in Soriwila in the Manampitiya area before being murdered and dumped in the sea off Trincomalee. According to sources, one of the suspects under arrest in connection with the case has said that Ekneligoda's body was first buried in Soriwila.
"The CID teams handling investigations found information to suggest that Eknaligoda's body had later surfaced due to the flooding of the pit and following this, the body had been removed from the site and had been dumped into the sea," a highly placed Police source told the Daily News.
Investigations revealed that two Army Intelligence Division members, who are already in CID custody, abducted Ekneligoda in 2010. They were former LTTE members belonging to the Karuna faction.
It is believed that Eknaligoda may have been killed in a transit camp at Mannampitiya, which was under the control of Vinayagamoorthy Muralitharan alias Karuna Amman, and Sivanesathurai Chandrakanthan alias Pilleyan. At the time Eknaligoda was abducted, Pilleyan had acted as the officer in charge of the camp. Placing an army camp under a para-military group leader alone is a serious lapse on the part of the military!
Meanwhile, information has surfaced that Ekneligoda's disappearance was due to direct orders by a high ranking individual in the defence establishment during the time of the previous regime. Eknaligoda was abducted two days before the Presidential election in 2010.
At present, 11 suspects including several Army Officers are still in CID custody and investigations are ongoing. Among them are Lt. Col. Shammi Kumara Ratnayake, Lt. Col. Siriwardena, Staff Sergeant Rajapakse, Corporal Jayalath, retired Sergeant Maj. Ranbanda, Sergeant Maj. Upasena, retired Corporal Ranjith Rupasena, Corporal Anurajeewa and ex-LTTE intelligence members Thavendran and Satya Master. In addition, the CID has also questioned Brigadier Aruna Wanniarachchi, a senior military officer who was previously attached to the intelligence wing, for nearly six hours, in connection with Eknaligoda's disappearance.
Investigations ruffle certain military feathers
Police sources hinted at the possibility of a former official, who played a significant role in the defence apparatus in the country, being questioned by the CID over the journalist's disappearance. The official is already facing numerous investigations on the anti-corruption front.
The CID teams took the suspects to the Girithale Army camp last week, under the protection of the Military Police, to identify places where the abducted journalist was allegedly kept. It was revealed that the journalist had been detained at the Girithale army camp for more than five days. During the first two days, he had been questioned over a booklet titled 'family tree' and his alleged associations with former Army Commander Sarath Fonseka who was then a Presidential candidate. After questioning, the journalist had been subjected to torture for nearly three days.
However, investigations into the cases involving Raviraj and Eknaligoda have ruffled a lot of feathers among sections of the defence establishment in Sri Lanka. Some members of the defence establishment are of the view that the investigations have exposed the names of intelligence wing members who operated under the radar during the final phase of war against the LTTE.
The information surfaced during the investigations into the cases of Eknaligoda and Raviraj highlighted the fact that some top echelons of the previous rule had used intelligence wing operations as a tool to cover up legal acts.
When the matter was raised at top level discussions within the government, President Maithripala Sirisena has stressed the need for carrying out investigations into the killings as such acts could not be justified, at any cost. The government has also assured the international community that it will carry out investigations into the murders of Eknaligoda and Raviraj without leaving space for undue political interference. The progress of the two investigations will also come into play when the member nations of the UNHRC assess the success of the Sri Lankan government's war crimes inquiry mechanism, after 18 months.
