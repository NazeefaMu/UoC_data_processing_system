[CITIZENS' Mail - (14-05-2018)]

Outstation cafes and exorbitant prices
Long distance buses are stopped for refreshment near wayside hotels. These hoteliers take the opportunity to sell their food items double the average prices. It does not matter paying more if the quality of the eatables is better. Evan a cup of tea is sold for Rs. 50 instead of Rs. 40 and the quantity of it too is very less. Unhygienic and previous day’s stuff is also a matter to be noted.
Therefore, the passengers to be satisfied with the services provided, all the outstation bus drivers should be instructed by the National Transport Commission (NTC) to forward a list of the hotels where they stop for refreshment.
The NTC should warn those hotels to be fair in their prices while they should be compelled to display a board which the NTC will provide with its contact numbers for the passengers to inform about the quality of the food, the freshness of them, then the prices of same etc.
This will surely make hoteliers serve the passengers in a better way. They should be warned that if they are found guilty of any offence the first punishment will be to close the hotel for a period of six months. Additional months of closure should be imposed for recurring offences.
