Michael Flynn: Trump's national security adviser quits role

 
White House national security adviser Michael Flynn has resigned over his contacts with Russia.
Flynn is alleged to have discussed US sanctions with the Russian ambassador before President Trump took office.
Flynn is said to have misled officials about the conversation.
Earlier, US media reported that the Justice Department had warned the White House about the contacts late last month.
They said that Flynn might be vulnerable to Russian blackmail.
Senior Democrats had called for Flynn to be fired.
It is illegal for private citizens to conduct US diplomacy, and the calls happened late last year before Flynn was appointed to the administration.
In his letter of resignation, Flynn said he had "inadvertently briefed the vice-president elect and others with incomplete information regarding my phone calls with the Russian ambassador".
A White House statement said Gen Joseph Keith Kellogg had been appointed as interim replacement.
