Extraordinarily committed

The International Society of Nephrology (ISN) lauded President Maithripala Sirisena for his firm commitment and devotion to ridding Sri Lanka of kidney disease by presenting him with an award at the Galle Face Hotel on December 19.
Professor Adeera Levin, President of the ISN, presented President Sirisena with the 2016 Extraordinary Contributions to Kidney Health award in acknowledgment of his work to prevent chronic kidney disease of uncertain etiology (CKDu).
"This is an amazing honor to present Your Excellency with. This is the first time the ISN has in fact given this award for extraordinary contributions to people living with kidney disease," said Levin.
The event also marked the inauguration of the International Society of Nephrology-Gardiner CKDu fund, named in honor of Sanjeev Gardiner, the Presidential Ambassador for the Prevention of Kidney Disease.
The President, for his part, communicated his gratitude to the ISN on behalf of the Sri Lankan public, saying that credit for the successes against kidney disease are due not only to him, but also myriad people and institutions that worked together.
"The positive outcomes we have so far achieved are not only from my work, but also the work of countless individuals and organizations. Together, we are working to make Sri Lanka free from chronic kidney disease," he said.
There is no doubt that the President's contributions to battling CKDu are laudable and wide-ranging, but Sri Lanka must jump many hurdles so that the disease affects the fewest citizens possible.
CKDu is a somewhat mysterious disease, as its causes remain undiscovered.
There is, however, a strong prevalence of CKDu in populations that perform farm work; 61% of those suffering from CKDu in Sri Lanka are agricultural laborers, the lion's share of whom are low-income and do not have consistent access to clean drinking water.
Furthermore, the disease is most widespread in Sri Lanka's dry zones. It has been identified in eleven districts, and is most concentrated in the Anuradhapura and Polonnaruwa districts. Cases have been reported in about 60 divisional secretariats.
There are reportedly almost 21,000 patients currently suffering from CKDu in the most affected areas, according to the Ministry of Health. Patients generally suffer from nausea, anemia, and fatigue, and those who do not get treatment can experience kidney failure.
President Sirisena, well aware of the seriousness of the disease, formed the Presidential Task Force for Chronic Kidney Disease Prevention (PTF), that spreads information on how to prevent the disease and provides care for those afflicted with CKDu. Furthermore, the PTF works to coordinate information sharing between patients, doctors, and organizations that can lend help. The body is also responsible for compiling the National Policy and Plan (NPP) for the prevention of CKDu, a plan that the President hopes will prove exceptionally effective in combating the disease.
The NPP has already been enacted, and it helps to coordinate communication between the government and NGOs. Though it is called the National Policy and Plan, it will be enacted all the way from the national to the village level.
It was because of the inauguration of the NPP that the ISN decided to felicitate the President.
"The national-level program has been commenced and launched in a very short period of time, harnessing the energy and passion of not just doctors and nurses and researchers, but government officials as well as government ministries," Levin said.
"For this, we can all thank you tremendously. It's the only national policy or program, to my knowledge, that's ever been launched, and I think for that Sri Lanka needs to be commemorated and celebrated," she continued.
President Sirisena, despite receiving the prestigious award, vowed not to stop aiding the poor in their fight against CKDu.
"We, as a country, have to look into the lives of poor populations in our country. We have to look at their personal lives and help them. I am pleased to see the haves helping the have-nots in our country, but we must do more to guarantee the welfare of poor communities," he said.
"Only with more cooperation and by working together can we reduce this burden on our people and eradicate this disease. We can have a good day when 100% of CKDu patients are cured. We will face, meet, and then conquer this challenge," he added.
