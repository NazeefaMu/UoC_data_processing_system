Thisara’s missed catch was not the reason for our defeat - Malinga

Sri Lanka’s pace ace Lasith Malinga commenting on the ‘drop catch’ debate of Sri Lanka’s defeat to Pakistan in the Champions Trophy on Monday said that he is not frustrated or disappointed by two catches missed off his bowling.
Speaking during a press conference at SLC headquarters after they arrived from England yesterday, Malinga said: “I don’t blame anyone for I know these kinds of things can happen when you play under so much pressure. I do not believe Thisara’s drop catch is the reason for our defeat and honestly I don’t blame Thisara for the mistake he made. That is all part of the game.”
Sarfraz Ahmed the Pakistan captain was missed twice by Thisara Perera and by substitute fielder Seekkuge Prasanna. Making capital of those missed opportunities Sarfraz went onto steer Pakistan to a three wickets win and a place in the semi-finals. Malinga also mentioned that the fielders are often subject to criticism when they make mistakes, but rarely admired their great contributions on the field. They deserve a proper recognition too,” Malinga added.
Captain Angelo Mathews accepted that the whole team is responsible for the loss. “We had a fairly good start but were unable to maintain consistency in batting. On the bright side I think it was a fantastic effort as a team against strong India. It is good to see our young players getting good scores and fighting bravely,” said Mathews.
“We missed a few chances but that’s how the game goes. We must learn from our mistakes and move forward.”
Sri Lanka was eliminated from the Champions Trophy group stage when they lost their final match to Pakistan by three wickets.
