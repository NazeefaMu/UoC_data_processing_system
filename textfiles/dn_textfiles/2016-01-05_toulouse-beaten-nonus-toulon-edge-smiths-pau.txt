Toulouse beaten as Nonu's Toulon edge Smith's Pau

 
PARIS, SUNDAY: Champions Stade Francais scored a dramatic late try in an 18-17 win over Toulouse in France's Top 14 on Sunday after Ma'a Nonu's Toulon had beaten Conrad Smith's Pau earlier in the day.
The defeat denied Toulouse a chance to go clear at the summit of the Top 14, although they left Paris with a losing bonus point that leaves them locked in a three-way tie on 38 points at the top of the table with Racing 92 and Clermont.
Stade Francais' New Zealand-born fullback Paul Williams was the man of the moment after touching down in the 78th minute in what was a stunning turnaround.
Hugo Bonneval had brought the Parisians back into the running with a fine try in the 63rd minute on a blustery night in the capital.
But Toulouse will be kicking themselves after going ahead through Alexis Palisson as early as the fourth minute.
Sebastien Bezy scored four penalties in all for the visitors but Jules Plisson's two penalties and a conversion helped secure an unlikely victory for Stade, who have struggled to repeat the form that saw them win the Top 14 last season.
"I would be lying if I said I wasn't relieved and extremely satisfied to win that match," said Stade manager Gonzalo Quesada.
Title contenders Toulon recovered from last week's chastening defeat at Toulouse with a nervy 21-17 victory at home to Pau.
Wallaby wing James O'Connor scored tries in both halves with Georgian lock Konstantin Mikautadze also crossing for Toulon, while full-back Tom Taylor added a pair of penalties.
However, the three-time reigning European champions were forced to stave off a late Pau comeback inspired by World Cup-winning All Blacks pair Smith and Colin Slade as the visitors scored 14 unanswered points only to fall just short.
With three pivotal European Champions Cup games, two against Bath and a home tie with Wasps, to come later this month, it was a welcome win that pushed Toulon back up to fourth as Pau claimed a losing bonus point.
"We're going to try to be positive and remember the win but we're certainly not happy with parts of our performance," said Toulon head coach Bernard Laporte.
"Two years ago that's a game we would have lost. We won and that's the most important thing. We have an important month of January, starting next Sunday against Bath. It's up to us to deliver."
Toulon, routed 31-8 at Toulouse last time out, fell behind early as fly-half Slade sent over a third-minute penalty for Pau, who entered the weekend in 11th place and drop below Stade Francais to 12th.
But Taylor, another ex-New Zealand international, responded moments later with a penalty of his own to level at 3-3.
