Missing SL fishermen rescued

 Maldives Coast Guard on Wednesday, located a Sri Lanka fishing vessel a drift since late December and rescued the four member crew.
The Sri Lanka government had officially enlisted the assistance of the Maldives Coast Guard when the fishermen had gone missing shortly after their departure from the neighbouring country on December 24. Two stranded Sri Lankan fishermen were rescued by the Maldivian Coast Guard after some local fishermen spotted them last week.
The Maldives Coast Guard in a statement said the vessel was adrift 153 miles off the coast of Haa Dhaal Atoll Maknunudhoo island in the wee hours of Thursday morning. One out of the four crew members found on-board was reportedly weak from the ordeal. The statement said the Coast Guard was now transporting the rescued fishermen to Haa Dhaal Atoll Kulhudhuffushi island.
The vessel is expected to reach the island around 11pm Thursday, the Coast Guard said. AVAS online
