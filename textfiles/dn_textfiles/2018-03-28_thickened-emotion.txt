thickened with emotion

In 1995, the UNESCO introduced 14 short narratives as a collection for young readers. The countries included Afghanistan, Burma (now Myanmar), India, Indonesia, Iran, Japan, Korea, Malaysia, Nepal, Pakistan, Philippines, Singapore, Sri Lanka and Thailand. That marked the commencement of a new series of readers selected under the broad programme by the Asian co-publication project carried out in collaboration with the UNESCO by the Asian Cultural Centre for UNESCO/Tokyo Book Development Centre.
It is recorded that these narratives have been selected with the editorial help of the publishers of five countries with a central editorial board in consultation with the UNESCO member states in Asia, where Sri Lanka is included as well. On reading the 14 narratives, a reader may feel that they are meant to express chiefly the sensitive and complex sparkling experiences in the particular countries with reference to the cultural impact on juvenile behaviour patterns.
Cultural standpoint
As such, though thematically different, the central impact on the reader’s mind becomes an identity of that particular cultural standpoint. This enables the reader to feel the unity in diversity as regards the human existence. Varying types of experiences and varying types of structures are seen.
The first story that comes from Afghanistan titled as The Hawk and the Tree revolves around the life of a cobbler and his pet bird, hawk. This intends to give the impression that though the bird of the type known as a hawk is a hunter bird is nevertheless innocent when it is observed closely. The behaviour patterns of the cobbler are seen from the point of view of a young man who comes to know that the hawk undergoes gradually the pangs of death as its leg is tied to a string where it gets entangles to a branch of a tree.
The hawk undergoes a gradual death due to suffering in the entanglement. The central point that the writer intends to drive in is much more serious than the mere outer story layer. The cobbler who used to feed the hawk is known by the term Sparrow Hawk. The cobbler gradually comes to know that his constant companion, the hawk is trapped and undergoes a tragic death, despite his feeding nature.
The story comes to a close with the following lines:
I caught sight of the hawk hanging from another branch.
“Why has he returned?” I asked myself.
But then I saw there was a second string on its foot, a string that stretched all the way to the cobbler’s shop. And this string was made of live sparrows.
There is food for thought beside the narrative line.
Beautiful thief
The second story comes from Myanmar. The Beautiful, Beautiful Heron is just the opposite type where a very young boy attracted by a heron, tries to own it by means of a theft. But he is struck by self-delusion and perhaps undergoes mental worry. As such, he refrains from being a thief. He is constantly reminded of a counterpart of a Robin Hood and gives up the intention.
One of the most notable and resourceful creations come from Iran titled as The Poet and the Sun written by Cyrus Tahbah. The work is an admixture of prose and poetry resembling some of the prose poems of Rabindranath Tagore in Gitanjali. The intention of the original writer is to depict the inner nature of a young boy, who so likes the various ways that he wants to come closer to the sun, in order to touch and feel it. But gradually as he ascends a mountain and comes closer to the sky, he comes to know that the sun is far away. The storyteller movingly makes the reader feel the pulse of the youngster in words:
The boy liked the sun. He liked the sun most of all. He could see, hear and sing in the sun.
The boy liked the birds. He liked their awakening songs. He liked to watch them fly and the colour of their wings in the sun.
As the boy wants to know more about the sun, the creator of the narrative envelopes various poetic visions that cover the developing process. In the end, he recalls a poem rendered by his father, in which he perceives the not merely the information but the knowledge he desired so much. The connecting poetic vision goes as follows:
Down by the river, an old turtle roams about, sunny is the day.
The old turtle lies in the warmth of the sun, sleeps peacefully by the river.
Down by the river, I am alone.
In the pain of desire,
I am looking forward to meeting my sun. Not even for one moment, do my eyes capture it. My sun has turned its face away from me in the faraway water.
If interpreted carefully, the narrative rests on two layers: fantasy and reality.
Sybil Wettasinghe
This form of narratives is cleverly perceived by our own children’s story writer and illustrator, Sybil Wettasinghe. Her short narrative, as I understand, is not only a story written for children but also for adults. The story in the collection is titled as A Lantern as Big as a Home. The narrative revolves around two characters, the granny and her grandson. As the Vesak dawns, the children in Sri Lanka are drawn to illuminate their houses with lanterns, using bamboo sticks and tissue paper. Granny loves her grandson who is denoted by the term Patiya. He comes to know through her association and loving kindness the various meanings adduced to faith and devotion. Both of them utilise time and energy in lighting up the house in the best way of making a Vesak lantern.
Surprisingly enough, however, the lantern is made in a massive manner with the grandest glory of creation; the old granny is seen inside the lantern. She manages to come out. Their effort is fulfilled as people come to see it. But the story rests on other layers as well. Granny is made to recall her days spent which culminates in her ways of imparting the same to Patiya.
She tells him:
If by renouncing some little pleasure a wise man can derive greater pleasure, let him renounce his little pleasure for the greater one.
The storyteller, Sybil, mentions that Patiya did not quite understand but he knew that granny was happy, filled with joy, beyond his understanding.
All in all, these 14 stories that come from 14 Asian countries could be reckoned as one of the best gifts for the settlement of social conflicts that rise up day by day.
