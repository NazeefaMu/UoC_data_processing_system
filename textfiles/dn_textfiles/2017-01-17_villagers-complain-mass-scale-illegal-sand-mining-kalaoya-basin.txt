Villagers complain of mass scale illegal sand mining in Kalaoya basin

Mass scale illegal sand mining carried out in the Kalaoya basin bordering the Wilpatthuwa National park has caused immense danger to several locations along the Kala Oya banks, residents complained to the authorities.
Residents alleged that racketeers involved are doing this sand illegal mining business after obtaining permits to the lands fed by the Thawusamadu project on the pretext of collecting paddy by inveigling the officials at the secretariat.
Residents alleged that several tractors laden with sand mined in the area crisscross the Wanathawilluwa Sanctuary daily, damaging the eco-system.
They allege that the Wanathwilluwa Divisional Secretary seemed to have turned a blind eye towards this illegal sand mining racket.
Residents alleged that wild animals including elephants frightened by the rumbling of tractors and other vehicles in the park, invade the adjoining villages.
However, Wanathwilluwa Divisional Secretary Sanjeevani Herath when contacted said they had never issued a sand mining permit in respect of this area in the Kala Oya.
She said a permit was issued earlier, but had been withdrawn later. There is a paddy tract known as Thawusamaduwa and two permits had been issued to persons cultivating paddy land. "Today houses were being built in the area for the benefit of several displaced families who had returned to the area. They had been issued with a permit to mine sand for making cement bricks."
