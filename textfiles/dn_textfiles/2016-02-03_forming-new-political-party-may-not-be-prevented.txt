Forming of new political party may not be prevented

The emergence of alternate political force cannot be prevented if the SLFP leadership doesn’t win over the confidence of the party’s grassroots, Kandy District UPFA Parliamentarian Keheliya Rambukwella said.
Rambukwella said a large section of the SLFP grassroots supporters have lost confidence in the party leadership. He said not paying heed to the voice of the lower level membership would have disastrous results on the party.
A vast majority of the grassroots membership believed the party could not be carried forward to victory without former President Mahinda Rajapaksa’s support, he said, and therefore an urgent solution should be found to the problem, before the forthcoming local government election.
