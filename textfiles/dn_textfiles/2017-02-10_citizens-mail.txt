Citizens' Mail

Ranjan exposes shortcomings in bureaucratic machinery
The manner in which Deputy Minister Ramanayake publicly dealt with the Divisional Secretary of Divulapitiya for her alleged failure to prevent the illegal mining of a large extent of soil brought into focus a major shortcoming in the states bureaucratic machinery not only in the prevention of the devastation of the environment, but even more importantly the daylight robbery of the state’s natural resources.
Although precious metals, diamonds or petroleum have not been discovered to date, Sri Lanka is richly endowed with gem stones of high value, high quality graphite, limestone, quartz, granite, rare endemic species of fauna and flora, mangroves and wetlands. Sand, earth and clay have become natural resources much in demand today because of the booming construction industry.
The Divulapitiya incident has shown that the issue of licences for the exploitation of these resources is a farce. Armed with a licence for the excavation of eg. a hundred cubes of soil or sand millions of cubes are excavated; with a licence for one gem pit hundreds of pits are dug; with a permit to fill 20 perches of land acres are reclaimed. Defective licenses are issued eg. places and quantities not specified ensuring failed prosecutions. These are intentionally done in most cases.
The open and blatant manner in which organized gangs carry out these operations invariably with the backing of a politician in power and officials turning a blind eye make the people believe that such operations are being lawfully carried out.
The businessmen who carry out large scale exploitation of these resources often engage the services of underworld criminals and bribe officials including law-enforcement officers. As a result people fear to complain or provide information to the authorities concerned.
The Divulapitiya incident is truly an eye opener. The President and others concerned should look at the positive side to this episode. Ramanayake may have been excessively harsh on the Divisional Secretary. But being a candid and forthright politician with a reputation for honesty his burst of anger is understandable. Any law abiding citizen would have been agitated seeing the devastation that the landscape had undergone.
These corrupt activities so prolific and widespread are causing inestimable losses to the state and illegally benefiting a coterie of rogues. The nation is indebted to Ramanayake for exposing this albeit unintentional. He should continue to fearlessly provide leadership for the eradication of this canker. What better cause than the preservation of the environment and the ending of the plunder of the state to the tune of billions.
This subtle manner in which losses are caused to the country has reached alarming proportions Apart from heavy fines, legal provision for the mandatory confiscation of all such illegal earnings appears to be the only solution.
