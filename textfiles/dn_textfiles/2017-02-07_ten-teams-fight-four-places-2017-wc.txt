Ten teams fight for four places for 2017 WC

Women’s cricket teams from ten nations will be seen in action in Colombo from today to February 21 where the top four teams among them will qualify to play in the 2017 Women’s World Cup which is to be held in England in June 2017.
Host Sri Lanka, India, Ireland, Zimbabwe and Thailand will battle in the Group ‘A’ while South Africa, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Scotland and Papua New Guinea are slotted in the Group ‘B’ at the Women’s World Cup qualifier first round. Only the top four teams of the points table after the Super Six stage will earn a place in June’s big event and also the opportunity to play in the next ICC Women’s Championship. First round will play in round-robin format where the best three teams of each group will advance to the Super Six round.
The decisive Super Six rounds will have two groups of three teams each with a card of nine matches. Each team of a group will battle with all three teams of the other group to determine point table leaders. Two top Super Six round teams will play the final of the qualifiers on February 21 at P. Sara Oval. Two dropouts from the Super Six stage will able to continue or gain ODI status for another four years.
Lankan women’s captain Inoka Jayaweera was very optimistic that her team is eager to capitalize on home advantage. “We have been practicing hard from about three months and the girls are ready to take up the challenge,” Inoka stated during a press briefing at the Galadari Hotel yesterday.
