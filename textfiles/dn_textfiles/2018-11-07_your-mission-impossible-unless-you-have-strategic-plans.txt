So, you want to start-up and develop a small business – Part 09
Your mission is impossible unless you have strategic plans

Have you ever been involved in a business that never seems to accomplish very much? Regardless of how hard you work, you just go in circles. The problem may be that you have not decided where you want to go and have not created a roadmap of how to get there. From the perspective of acompany, the problem may be that you are not focusing on what you want to achieve and how you will achieve it.
The first is a statement of vision. It provides a destination for the company. Next is a statement of mission. This is a guiding light of how to get to the destination. These are critical statements for the company and the individuals who run the company.
In short, vision is the big mental picture of what you want to achieve. Mission is the general statement of how you will achieve the vision.
For example, your vision may be to have a successful family grocery business. Your Mission maybe to provide hygienic and high-quality grocery products to the nation, both wholesale and retail.
As you can see, there is a close relationship between the vision and mission. As the vision statement is a static mental picture of what you want to achieve, the mission statement is a dynamic process of how the vision will be accomplished.
Let us check few vision statements of leading global organisations.
l To be the most creative organisation in the world. –BBC
l To use our unlimited passion for technology, content and services to deliver ground-breaking new excitement and entertainment. - SONY
l To provide access to the world’s information in one click. - GOOGLE
l To remain the most authentic, connected, and distinctive brand. - NIKE
In this instalment, we will give emphasis to mission statement as it is the dynamic process.
A good mission statement is a written, easy-to-remember sentence, a short list of bullet points, or a paragraph illustrating your business’s goals and purpose in life. Or, in other words, it’s what makes your company special. Mission statements come in many sizes, shapes, and forms, but they all have one common purpose: to guide you and your employees in making the critical decisions that affect your company’s direction.
Additionally, your mission statement should identify your company to outsiders - your customers, your vendors, the media, and others. To give you an idea of how well-developed mission statements identify the businesses behind them, let us give you few of them.
l To enrich people’s lives with programmes and services that inform, educate and entertain. BBC.
l To be a company that inspires and fulfils your curiosity. Sony.
l To organize the world’s information and make it universally accessible and useful. Google.
l Bring inspiration and innovation to every athlete in the world. (If you have a body, you are an athlete.)
Writing your mission statement
The question you should answer when creating your mission statement is, “What solution do I provide, and what must I do to make sure that the solution I provide is consistently delivered?”
So, how should your mission statement read? Let us help you. For example: If you were going to open a new bookstore, would your mission statement state “to sell books” or “to increase the educational and enjoyment levels of customers”?
If you were going to start a contracting business, would your mission statement read “to build houses” or “to provide affordable building solutions for customers”?
If you were planning to start a service and repair shop to handle household plumbing and electricity, would your mission statement be “to handle plumbing and electricity issues in your home” or “to provide houseowners with solutions to their plumbing and electricity problems and maintaining them life-long trouble free”?
You’d choose the second option. Notice the common inference in all three of these mission statements to the key word solutions. Give yourself plenty of room to grow within your niche when you develop your business’s mission statement.
For instance, when a bookstore owner defines the mission behind her business as “education and enjoyment,” she leaves open the option to sell DVDs rather than just books. When a contractor defines his purpose to provide “building solutions,” he has the option to build garages, barns, and outbuildings, in addition to homes.
Keeping your mission in people’s minds
For your mission statement to be effective, it should be readily accessible to your customers, employees, and all those who come into contact with your business. So, after your company is up and running, be sure to display your mission statement in many places: On the walls and bulletin boards in the most visible places in your business: Posting your mission statement in such visible places serves as a constant reminder to you, your employees, and your customers of what your business is all about.
It should be in the executive summary section of your business plan. Investors and other important outsiders are often busy and appreciate reading the highlights of your plan first and then selectively delving into the details as they feel necessary.
It should also be on the first page of your employee manual, if your business is large enough to warrant a manual. This prominent placement demonstrates to employees what their number one concern should be when they come to work each day. On every document your company generates, including but not limited to stationery, faxes, newsletters, and e-mails: This may seem like overkill, but it helps everyone to internalize the company’s purpose.
Strategies and goals
Once you have created statements of vision and mission, you can then develop the strategies, goals, objectives and action plans needed to activate your mission and achieve your vision.
Strategies – A strategy is a statement of how you are going to achieve something. More specifically, a strategy is a unique approach of how you will use your mission to achieve your vision. Strategies are critical to the success of a company because this is where you begin outlining a plan for doing something. The more unique the company, the more creative and innovative you need to be in crafting your strategies.
Goals – A goal is a general statement of what you want to achieve. More specifically, a goal is a milestone(s) in the process of implementing a strategy. Examples of business goals are: increase profit margin, increase efficiency, capture a bigger market share, provide better customer service, improve employee training.
Be sure the goals are focused on the important aspects of implementing the strategy. Be careful not to set too many goals or you may run the risk of losing focus. Also, design your goals so that they don’t contradict and interfere with each other.
A goal should meet the following criteria: (a) Understandable: Is it stated simply and easy to understand? (b) Suitable: Does it assist in implementing a strategy of how the mission will achieve the vision? (c) Acceptable: Does it fit with the values of the company and its members/employees? (d) Flexible: Can it be adapted and changed as needed?
Objectives
An objective turns a goal’s general statement of what is to be accomplished into a specific, quantifiable, time-sensitive statement of what is going to be achieved and when it will be achieved. Examples of business objectives are: (a) Earn at least a 20 percent after-tax rate of return on our investment during the next fiscal year. (2) Increase market share by 10 percent over the next three years. (3) Lower operating costs by 15 percent over the next two years through improvement in the efficiency of the management and product process. (4) Reduce the call-back time of customer inquiries and questions to no more than four hours.
Action Plans – These plans are statements of specific actions or activities that will be used to achieve a goal within the constraints of the objective. An example of an action plan:
Goal – improve skills of shames people
Objective – Conduct two training programs in the next six months
Action – Hire a professional trainer.
Action plans are converted to a full blown and detailed business plan where goals and objectives are also included. We will discuss it next week.
