Navy rescues five fishermenNavy rescues five fishermen

Sri Lanka Navy Ship Sayurala on Thursday evening rescued five fishermen stranded at sea off Point Pedro due to an engine failure of their fishing vessel.
The fishing vessel. Tharanga 1 had left the Cod Bay fisheries harbour in Trincomalee on June 13 and undergone difficulties when its engine malfunctioned in the deep sea.
The Naval Headquarters directed SLNS Sayurala upon receiving signals from the fishing boat to rescue the distressed fishermen and their fishing vessel. The navy ship located the vessel drifting in sea about 26 nautical miles north of Point Pedro and promptly rescued the fishermen. The fishermen and the fishing vessel were handed over to the Kankesanthurei harbour.
