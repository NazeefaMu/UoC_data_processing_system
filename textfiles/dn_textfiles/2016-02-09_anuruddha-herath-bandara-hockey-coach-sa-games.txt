Anuruddha Herath Bandara - hockey coach for SA Games

 
Former National goal keeper Anuruddha Herath Bandara who is a provincial sports journalist will go as the hockey coach of the national men's hockey team for the South Asian Games being held in Guwahati, India.
There was a bit of a hiccup whether the men's hockey team will make the tour as an injunction on the selections of players in the squad caused some doubts but saner counsel prevailed and the team left for the championship on Friday night.
Anuruddha Herath Bandara is an experienced coach and had coached with tremendous success Vijaya College, Matale winning a large haul of trophies. He is on the staff of Vijaya College and is the present coach of Vijaya College.
A top class goal keeper who maintains his cool and hardly utters a word. He represented the Matale Schools through Christ Church College Matale, the Combined Schools and the Matale District. He also played for Matale in both Junior and Senior Nationals and for two years for the Kandy District in the Senior Nationals. He also played for Young Stars SC.
He represented Sri Lanka for a number of years till he retired from the game to give way for the younger generation, at a time he had many more years of hockey left in him and devoted his time in coaching, to give back to the game what he has received.
