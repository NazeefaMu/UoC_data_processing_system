‘SLITHM plays leading role  comforting Tourism Industry’

With Sri Lanka achieving 2 million arrivals for the first time in its history last year and the numbers expected to grow this year, the country’s hospitality industry is facing the challenge of a serious manpower shortage.
However the country’s premier tourism and hospitality industry trainer is optimistic that the issue is well under control.
“At the rate the hospitality industry has been expanding in the past few years it has no doubt been a challenge to prepare a skilled workforce to feed the industry.
It is therefore noteworthy that SLITHM, which is the premier national institution tasked with training personnel for the hospitality industry has taken up the challenge in a positive spirit by increasing its annual output without compromising on the quality of its products,” noted Minister of Tourism Development, John Amaratunga speaking on the success of the Sri Lanka Institute of Tourism and Hotel Management (SLITHM) which comes under the purview of the Ministry of Tourism Development and Christian Religious Affairs.
SLITHM formerly known as the Ceylon Hotel School, has been in the forefront of training personnel for the hospitality industry across all levels from job specific craft courses to high caliber professionals not only to meet national demands but also global requirements.
In accordance with the 2016 Budget, 650 individuals were trained by private sector institutions under the guidance of the Ministry of Tourism Development and Christian Religious Affairs through SLITHM which monitored training quality and provided necessary resource assistance for the successful completion of the programmes.
Meanwhile keeping with industry requirements, Sri Lanka Institute of Tourism and Hotel Management developed a syllabus and introduced a specialized course in hospitality finance namely, Certified Hospitality Finance and Management Accountant Professional Qualification (CHFMA) in collaboration with the Institute of Certified Management Accountants (CMA) of Sri Lanka.
Marking a significant milestone, 131 fully fledged hospitality professionals graduated from SLITHM last year. This is the highest number of graduates to pass out from the institution in a single batch since its inception 50 years ago. All of these graduates have secured employment in senior management positions.
The professionally qualified faculty of SLITHM most of who are alumni of the institution, are constantly encouraged to further their education and are offered scholarships in countries such as the USA, China, Germany and Korea.
With Sri Lanka’s tourism industry moving in to top gear with the anticipated arrival of a number of new international hotel brands alongside a record number of visitors in 2017, SLITHM is poised to continue its leading role in guiding the destinies of the nation’s tourism and hospitality industry.
