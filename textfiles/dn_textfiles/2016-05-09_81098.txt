KG crackdown as Navy, PNB swoop on smugglers

Within the last six months, 1,490 kgs of Cannabis from Kerala, commonly known as Kerala Ganja, have been seized while 14,799 suspects in relation to smuggling, distributing and possessing Kerala Ganja were arrested by the Police, Police Narcotics Bureau (PNB) sources revealed. The authorities are now planning to set up an information exchange centre for the South Asian Region to combat the issue.
The frequency of smuggling Kerala Cannabis from India is evident from recent detections, Police Narcotics Bureau Director SSP Kamal Silva said.
The latest detection was from the North Western Province last week, with five Indian nationals being arrested with 100 kgs of Kerala Cannabis.
They were by the Sri Lanka Navy along the coastal line of Silawatura, Mannar.
Moreover, large quantities of Kerala Cannabis have been continuously seized by Police and Navy during the last six months. Kerala Cannabis weighing around 220 kgs valued at Rs. 40 million was seized by Police in Nawagaththegama, Puttalam in April.
Cannabis is transported to Sri Lanka mostly from South India with fishing boats used to smuggle the Cannabis, Dangerous Drugs Control Board Director General R. Gamage said.
He said there was no difference between the locally grown Cannabis and the Kerala variety.
SSP Silva said the quality of Kerala variety is higher than the local cannabis, increasing the demand for the imported variety.
It is said the price of Kerala Cannabis is over five times more than the local variety.
The smuggling usually takes place in the coastal area from Negambo to Jaffna. The sea route is used more than land route, Naval spokesman Commander Kosala Warnakulasuriya said.
The smugglers mostly enter as fishermen with hundreds of Indian fishing boats. Most packages are then transferred to boats headed to Sri Lanka, he added.
Cannabis and heroin are the major illicit drugs used in Sri Lanka, a report of the International Narcotics Control Board for 2015, United Nations revealed.
Cannabis is illicitly cultivated in the country. The estimated land area under cannabis cultivation was nearly 500 ha in 2014. Cannabis abuse has become a significant problem in Sri Lanka.
According to SSP Silva, there are only two ways to curb the rising smuggling of Kerala Cannabis. One is reducing the demand of Cannabis within the country and the second is to reduce the supply of Cannabis.
The National Drugs Control Board together with police conduct awareness programmes and rehabilitation programmes to reduce the demand of Cannabis, he said.
SSP Silva noted that investigations and detections are carried out by Police and Navy to discontinue the supply of Kerala Cannabis within the country.
Naval patrol craft have been deployed in all suspected areas in the North Western Naval Command, Commander Warnakulasooriya said.
Stating that the Navy maintains continuous surveillance along the coastal belt to prevent drug smuggling via sea, he assured that the Navy conducts intense patrolling along the vulnerable coastline to foil smuggling attempts
Gamage acknowledging that police and other security agencies were making serious efforts to crackdown on the drug smuggling, said Police and Navy apprehend smugglers and the role of Dangerous Drugs Control Board is to monitor them.
Sri Lanka has a clear legislation and the police take legal action against the smugglers, he emphasised.
Gamage added that a proposal to establish an Information Exchanging Centre for the South Asian Region has been referred to the Law and Order and Southern Development Ministry.
With Cabinet approval, further discussions will take place with the United Nations Organisation and the Indian Government to establish the centre, he added.
