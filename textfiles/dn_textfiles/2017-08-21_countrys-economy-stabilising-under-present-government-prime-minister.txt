Country's economy stabilising under present government: Prime Minister

"The country's economy has achieved some form of stability under the present Government. The loans obtained by the country should be settled during the present generation without leaving it to the next. We will be saddled with the highest amount of loans in 2020. Repayment of loans will not be a problem because the country will be able to record a higher income by then," Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said.
The Prime Minister was addressing a series of meetings in the Akuressa electorate after opening several new divisional secretariat buildings in Hulandawa, Malimbada and Thibbbotuwawa and opening several estate housing projects on August 18.
The Prime Minister recalled the first political revolution occurred in the country in 1956 and said the second political and economic revolution occurred in 1977 after J.R. Jayewardene became Prime Minister with a five sixth majority in parliament. "The next revolution occurred in 2015 even devoid of two third majority in parliament. That was with the setting up of a national government with the two main parties joining in. This was a unique and exceptional development unprecedented in South Asia," he said.
Prime Minister Wickremesinghe said that by the end of its first two year term, several concessions had been granted to the people as economic relief in consultation with the Finance Minister.
"After abolishing the 10 percent telecommunication levy, companies in the sector were requested to grant a corresponding relief on their part. Now they have granted relief in the form of a data package. This now added up to a 20 percent concession which would increase internet use and earn more income for the country.
"The massive tax concession granted to light vehicles would help facilitate the vehicle needs of areas like the Southern Province for transport of tea and other goods. The tax relief on motorcycles would grant a concession of nearly Rs. 50,000 to people purchasing such vehicles. The increased import of light vehicles would be a great impetus towards developing the village economy," the Prime Minister said.The Premier said the main objective of the Yahapalana Government was to increase the amount of money in the hands of the ordinary public. The Prime Minister said the management of the Hambantota Port, which was a white elephant earlier was given to a Chinese company on a 70-year lease.
"As a result the country will get 1.1 billion US dollars; a part of which can be put to use after paying part of a loan. Discussions were on with the Indian Government for managing operations of the Mattala Airport. As a result, the port and airport would become profitable ventures without being a national burden. The China Merchant Company will operate ships to Hambantota.
"It had expressed interest in starting an oil refinery there and setting up of a NLG power station to provide electricity tot he area.
"Inquiries were made to launch a steel factory, a dock yard, and a cement factory in Hambantota. It would be adequate for us even if half of these projects came into fruition.
"An industrial zone would be set up at Hambantota and a tourism zone at Mattala. Nearly 2,000 acres would be apportioned for setting up a tourism from Bentara to Pitabeddara. The first tourist zone would be set up at Dedduwa before the end of this year. Another industrial zone would be set up at Weligama. All these would bring development to Hiniduma, Deniyaya, Rakwana and other areas bordering the Sinharaja forest," the Prime Minister said. He said the Government was now implementing its pledge to provide houses for plantation Workers. Steps were taken to introduce science as an Advanced Level subject in plantation Tamil schools.
The Prime Minister said the previous regime held the presidential election two years before because it was unable to overcome the massive debt burden. The Government had not run away from the debt burden inherited by the previous.
w"We are improving the economy and trying to overcome the debt burden while offering relief to the people," he said.
"We have now launched the development era. We have transformed loss making institutions into profitable ventures. We will never heap unnecessary burdens on the people. We will ensure a better future for youth. So let us join hands in this forward march as your support is most crucial for its ultimate success," the Prime Minister said.
