No general election until 2020: Ranawaka

 
A general election will not be held until 2020. During this period, all should eschew party politics and rebuild the country socially and politically by defeating forces trying to obstruct the country's progress, Megapolis and Western Development Minister Patali Champika Ranawaka said.
He was addressing a meeting after inaugurating work on the second stage of the Homagama Town Development Scheme yesterday.
Ranawaka said Kottawa and Homagama were very important areas connected to the Western Development Master Plan.
The new inventions and scientific city will be built around Kottawa and Homagama. This will transform Homagama into the centre of the country's economic progress within the next five years, the minister said. Ranawaka said the new project would result in a modern fully equipped bus station incorporating the old and new bus stands.
A technological university would be set up in Homagama. A super market would also be set up in Homagama and all routes leading to the town would be fully developed, the minister said.
