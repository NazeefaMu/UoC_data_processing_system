Govijana Development Council replaces Agrarian Service Centre

The Govijana Development Council will come into effect in another six months replacing the Agrarian Service Centre said Irrigation Minister Duminda Dissanayake.
“Even though the farmers are represented, the final decisions are taken by the officers. It is clearly stated in the Govijana Development Act that the farmers should be given priority but it was never implemented. In future farmers will be given the opportunity to make decisions and the power will be in their hands,” he said.
The Minister was speaking at the launch of “Thirasara Lanka (Sustain Lanka)” programme at the BMICH yesterday.
Minister Dissanayake said out of 17 SDGs around 15 are in some way that connected to the Irrigation Ministry.
“The ministry organized a meeting with nearly 27,000 officers attached to the agricultural field. We briefed them about the SDGs and the measures that need to be taken to make it a success. So we have carried out many initiatives in the agricultural sector and they have benefited the people,” he said.
He further said that farmers who were affected by drought will be given compensations.
Minister Dissanayake said President Maithripala Sirisena understands the needs of the farmers in a better way.
“People are today reaping the benefits of the January 8 victory. The change that took place on January 8, 2015, was not just a change of a president but it lead to a transformation in the whole system,” he said.
