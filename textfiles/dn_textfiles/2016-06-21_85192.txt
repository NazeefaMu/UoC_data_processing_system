Harmonious Partnership for New York Philharmonic

Emirates is expanding its cultural sponsorship portfolio and has announced that it has signed a new multi-year sponsorship deal as the Official Airline of the New York Philharmonic. The contract begins June 2016 and will last for a period of three years. The sponsorship includes ticket and hospitality experiences at Lincoln Center’s David Geffen Hall and the New York Philharmonic Concerts in the Parks, Presented by Didi and Oscar Schafer, as well as branding and advertising opportunities.
The New York Philharmonic will be in good company as it joins Emirates’ roster of the world’s most renowned symphonies including the San Francisco Symphony, the Melbourne and Sydney Symphony Orchestras. Emirates’ support of the New York Philharmonic, San Francisco Symphony and Australian Symphonies will deliver world-class entertainment, connect to music patrons across the globe and highlights the airline’s commitment to arts and culture.
Their dedication to the growth of global arts and culture can be seen through a number of its sponsorships such as the Emirates Airline Festival of Literature, the Dubai Summer Surprises shopping festival, the Emirates Airline Dubai Jazz Festival and the Dubai International Film Festival.
These dynamic sponsorships inspire and bring cultural richness to people around the globe. Through this multi-year deal with the New York Philharmonic, Emirates hopes to bring beautiful music and this New York institution to the lives of many.
When flying Emirates, music comprises a significant part of the content offered on Emirates’ industry-leading ice entertainment system. Ice features over 1,000 music and podcast channels in almost 36 languages spanning genres such as Classical, Opera, Jazz and R&B among others. It also has channels dedicated to the Emirates Festival of Literature as well an audio book collection. The ice inflight entertainment system also has a dedicated channel to the symphony orchestras that the airline sponsors.
The New York Philharmonic partnership is a demonstration of Emirates’ continued commitment to New York, the city that welcomed Emirates to the United States nearly 12 years ago. Emirates launched services to the US with a non-stop flight between Emirates’ hub, Dubai International Airport (DXB), and New York’s John F. Kennedy International Airport (JFK) in 2004. Today, Emirates operates four daily flights to JFK including three daily flights from Dubai non-stop, as well as a daily flight to Milan and onwards to New York, all onboard Emirates’ flagship A380 aircraft.
