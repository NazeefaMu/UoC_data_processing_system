Canny canine’s farming tricks

Rambo the Golden Retriever attracts a stream of visitors to his home where he rides on a red Massey Ferguson tractor wearing a hi-viz vest in in County Down, Northern Ireland.
The hard-working dog has helped his master mow lawns, plough fields, cut down corn, and trim hedges.
The six-year-old dog is also the father of four puppies.
Rambo's owner, Albert Reid, said: "Nobody could believe it, when they saw it. They had to take photographs and video him.
"We have people that come to our yard who are just lost for words when they see him do his tricks, he is such a good dog as well. He is just too friendly and so welcoming with all the people that come round."
Albert is keen to show off his extremely talented dog and constantly puts Rambo's skills to the test.
Albert, 66, added: "He is a fantastic dog.
"I put him up on the tractor and then the dog will start his work from there. He has such a great temperament as well.
There were these two children and one of the girls who was with her granny and granddad was really scared of the dogs. The granny and granddad went to walk around the yard and when they came back the little girl was sitting there with her arms around Rambo.”
Retired lorry driver, Albert Reid, noticed his dog had these amazing talents since he was a puppy and said he has always been a helping hand for him.
"From a pup I just told him to sit there and I went out around the yard and he would just sit there and watch me. He helps me out a lot and he is good company to have. On a Saturday morning he will sit at the back of my Land Rover for hours waiting for me to go somewhere. He goes everywhere with me and everyone says 'whenever I see you, your always with that dog'.”
But there is one talent Rambo can't seem to get the hang of.
Albert, of County Down, Northern Ireland said: "He will sit and wait by my car but will never jump in himself. I always have to lift him into my car.
"His tail will go round like a helicopter because he will be so excited. But he just can't get himself to jump into my car for some reason." Mirror
