TBWAi Lanka Chief Creative Officer Subhash Pinnapola jury at ADFEST 2017

Subhash Pinnapola, TBWAi Lanka's Chief Creative Officer, joins the landmark 20th anniversary edition of ADFEST as jury member for Direct Lotus and Promo Lotus.
With Subhash'smany accolades, he brings his Asian expertise to ADFEST where he's excited to find the best of the best work in the categories he will be judging in.
Direct Lotus goes beyond the realm of traditional direct marketing to deliver measurable results with the consumer as well as to business to business marketing. Direct mediums can be used individually or in combination where there is a simple and clear method to measure success. The key to successful Direct communication is “targeted relationships” with measurable results.
Meanwhile, Promo Lotus involves the best use of promo and promotional activities created for the sole purpose of increasing sales. It includes tactics such as special sales, gift with purchase, competition, sampling, cross-brand tie-ups offers, limited time offer, and using the most effective channels resulting in an immediate measurable incremental action or sales of a product or service. The key in promotional marketing is a call for “action” within a limited time offer with measurable results.
“They're interesting categories. There is more action involved when compared to the traditional categories. I'm really looking forward to see some awesome work.” said Subhash
