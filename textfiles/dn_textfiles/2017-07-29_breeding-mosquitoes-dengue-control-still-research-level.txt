Breeding mosquitoes for dengue control still at research level

Breeding of dengue mosquitoes through a biological method to control dengue is still at research level. It will take another two to five years to obtain successful results, World Health Organization Representative to Sri Lanka Dr Razia Pendse said.
Addressing the Media Workshop on Dengue Prevention, Control and Management organized by the WHO and the Health Ministry at the Government Information Department Auditorium, she said dengue is an issue of national concern in Sri Lanka. A societal approach is needed to tackle dengue. Every individual needs to contribute to arrest dengue upswing. The WHO implements the global strategy for dengue prevention and control from 2002 to 2020.
According to Dr. Pendse, protecting against mosquito bite, vector prevention and control, and timely medical care are currently the only effective measures against dengue. There are no drugs yet to treat dengue. The treatment being provided seeks to address dengue symptoms and complications. With climate change, more frequent and larger outbreaks of dengue are being experienced globally. This trend can and must be arrested with enhanced vector control and personal protection practices.
Dr. B. N. Nagpal said there are certain issues when it comes to controlling dengue in Sri Lanka. For example, if a person is dengue infected through a dengue mosquito bite that takes place at the Government Information Department Auditorium, the health authorities would go to his/her home located 30 kilometres away from the Government Information Department Auditorium and fumigate the whole area. The dengue mosquito flies about 500 metres. Water tanks located on roof tops need to be cleaned thoroughly and regularly. The eggs of dengue mosquitoes survive for 400 days in dry condition.
Consultant Community Physician attached to the National Dengue Control Unit Dr. Nirmala Pannilahetti said a total of 301 dengue deaths and 110,372 dengue patients are reported from all parts of the country by Thursday. Dengue mosquitoes breed in places located inside construction sites, religious institutions and schools. Around 40 percent of dengue mosquitoes breed inside discarded items.
