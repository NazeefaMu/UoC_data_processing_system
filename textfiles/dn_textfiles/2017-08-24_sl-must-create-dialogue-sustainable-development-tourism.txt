'SL must create dialogue for sustainable development in tourism'


Sri Lanka tourism has been significantly making a remarkable growth since the end of war in 2009.
Tourism has so many impacts for the socio-economic development of Sri Lanka but it doesn’t mean that there are no challenges for the nation when developing tourism.
Sri Lanka as a country must create a dialogue to thrive for sustainable development, especially in the nation’s tourism industry.
In an interview Founder and Coordinator of Tourism Study Programmes at the University of Colombo Dr. Suranga Silva shed light on Sri Lanka’s tourism industry and the university’s role in its journey for sustainable success.

Q. As you said, Sri Lanka is facing many challenges when becoming a global player in the tourism industry. What do you think are the most current challenges we are facing?
A. As globalization takes place, industries are subjected to changes. When we look at the tourism industry we see new trends emerge as a result of global development. Tourism today has become a knowledge driven industry ever than before.
These changes take place according to the passion of the customer and their demands. This means that the trends are vague and less predictable.
Q. You just explained about the global trends but how do you aim to internalize these trends to the Sri Lankan scenario.
A. Tourism is a global product. It is no more a national product. Global trends works more in a one world, one market perspective. Most importantly the tourism industry now has to cater to individual customers that are mass customization.

Mass production is now outdated.No more mass product development with homogeneous tastes, economies of scales are now being challenged. Economies of Scopes are becoming dominant.
2017 is a very important year for the tourism industry. For the first time in known history tourism has become a slogan for world economic development.
The United Nations’ theme for this year is Sustainable Tourism for Development where they have indicated and connected 17 Sustainable Development Goals. Based on this the United Nations World Tourism Organization (UNWTO) has recognized five areas to be concerned with Sustainable Tourism Development.
They are: (1). Inclusive and sustainable economic growth, (2). Social inclusiveness, employment and poverty reduction, (3). Resource efficiency, environmental protection and climate change, (4). Cultural values, diversity and heritage and (5). Mutual understanding, peace and security.
Q. As a senior academic and the founder of tourism programmes in the University of Colombo what is your contribution to this?
A. The UN has very clearly identified the importance of sustainability. In its theme ‘Transforming our world: the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development’ there are five Ps being highlighted.
They are (1) People, (2) Planet, (2) Prosperity, (4) Peace and (5) Partnership.
From the university perspective we believe that we have the capacity and potential to combine all these five Ps into one of the most strongest and well connected platform in a bid to achieve sustainable development.
Q. We understand that meeting such a demand is not an easy task. How do you hope to achieve this?
A. Specifically we have an objective to establish a constructive dialogue and strong network among cooperate and business partners, industry leaders, national and regional policy makers, and research and academia in the sole objective of making effective strategies that can take Sri Lanka tourism to the international standards.
Therefore, we expect to organize several events during September and October of this year in parallel with the celebration of the World Tourism Day. These events are (1) Tourism Leaders’ Summit, (2) International Tourism Research Symposium with participation around 15-20 eminent international researchers and professors (3) Tourism Scholars’ Quiz with Seri Lankan and foreign tourism training and educational institutes, (4) Dialogue for Empowering Women for Tourism, (6) A survey for the identification of prospects, potential and challenges in enhancing women enrollment in tourism industry in Sri Lanka, (7) Tourism Industry Networking Cricket Match, (8) Tourism Awareness Walk, (9) Tree-planting Campaign.
All these events are focused to strengthen the Five P's of Sustainable Tourism Development.
Symposium will see a combination of Sri Lankan tourism front runners and foreign delegates from different countries.
In addition to these practitioners, CEOs of tourism Cooperate Sector and National Tourism Organizations from different countries will come to BMICH on 3 and 4 October 2017.
We believe that our tourism leaders’ summit will be the right platform to review a new strategic plan “Tourism Strategic Plan 2017-2020” for tourism development of the country.
Q. The local community is a vital component in tourism development. How do you hope to get their contribution to reach your vision of sustainable tourism?
A. Yes, if any policy maker implement the UN Sustainable Development Goals without the aid of the community that journey will only be a day-dream.
The biggest challenge we are facing right now is that we have not given the right awareness about sustainable tourism to our community.
These awareness programmes include the Tourism Scholars’ Quiz that is organized by the University of Colombo in partnership of the Sri Lanka Institute of Tourism & Hotel Management (SLITHM), Ministry of Tourism Development and Christian Religious Affairs.
Secondly, according to my knowledge a major shortcoming of Sri Lanka’s tourism sector is women participation.
This is especially seen clearly when taken other competitive destinations. Less than 10 per cent of women are actively involved in the tourism industry as employees.
Taking this into consideration we have planned to organize activities to empower women in partnership with the Ministry of Tourism Development and Christian Religious Affairs under the guidance of Minister John Amaratunga.
Women entrepreneurship would be greatly decisive for community based sustainable development of Sri Lanka.
Q. Finally, how is the University of Colombo or you involved in tourism?
A. I am the founder and coordinator of tourism study programmes of the University of Colombo.
We have study programmes starting from the certificate level to mater level. (www.uoctourism.com for more information.)
Here we have developed a reliable and internationally recognized academic path with the blessing of the Vice Chancellor of the University of Colombo Prof. Lakshman Dissanayake and the Faculty of Arts for anybody those wish to aspire their education in travel, tourism and hospitality management.
