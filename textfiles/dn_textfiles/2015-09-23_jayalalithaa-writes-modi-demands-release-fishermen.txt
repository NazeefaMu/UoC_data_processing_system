Jayalalithaa writes to Modi, demands release of fishermen

Voicing concern over the arrest of Indian fishermen by Lankan Navy in the ‘vicinity’ of Katchatheevu, the Tamil Nadu government has once again raised the demand that India “retrieve” the islet from Sri Lanka.
In a letter to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Chief Minister Jayalalithaa said 15 fishermen, who set sail from Nagapattinam, were apprehended by the Lankan Navy on September 21 and sought steps for their immediate release along with 28 boats in Lankan custody. This latest arrest of innocent and unarmed fishermen with a motive to “intimidate and prevent” them from venturing into their traditional fishing waters in the Palk Bay had happened in the vicinity of Katchatheevu, she said, the PTI said yesterday.
