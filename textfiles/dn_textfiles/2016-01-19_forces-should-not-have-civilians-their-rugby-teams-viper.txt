Forces should not have civilians in their rugby teams - Viper

It is a sad spectacle to see civilians playing rugby for the forces or Police teams and even foreigners have donned their jerseys in the past said former Sri Lanka, Sri Lanka Air Force, CR and FC and Vidyartha College flanker Viper Edwin Gunaratne.
He made these observations before the Kandy Sports Club - Sri Lanka Navy Dialog League rugby tournament match played at Nittawela recently. He was the Match Commissioner at this key match.
Viper Gunaratne Snr as he was known was one of the hardest and fearless tacklers this country has known. He was an automatic choice to the Sri Lanka team at a time the British born ruggerites from the plantations and the Agency Houses were packing their bags to return to 'Old Blighty' with the changes in the plantations and followed by the Land Reforms.
Asked why he was nicknamed as viper which in local parlance is the deadly 'polonga'. He said in one 'A' Division club match he was playing for Sri Lanka Air Force against Dimbula at Radella. The planters team was made up of hulky players who could bulldoze with the ball and the only way to stop them was to tackle the hard. He just did that.
He tackled so hard that five of his opponents had to seek medical assistance immediately and two others limped off probably with contusions. Air Force won the match against this planters side who were invincible at Radella. He over heard the opposing players telling the fellow players "be careful of that Viper". They did not know his name.
Next day the newspapers had the screaming headlines" A viper in the Air Force team sends five to the hospital "It was a catchy headline and caught the immediate attention of the readers as at one glance they thought these players were stung by a 'Polonga' in the field.
He played his entire rugby for Sri Lanka Air Force except for a brief period of one season when the airmen did not field a side due to the 1971 Insurrection. Money could not buy him as there were many lucrative offers but representing a club which was so close to his heart was greater. He signed off his career with the Air Force.
He said that the forces should field a team with home grown stuff as they have enough players at their disposal. They are trained to meet any situation. They are physically fit. They have the build who could be converted into forwards to have a heavy and mobile pack. Then there are the runners who could good three quarters like the case of Sudu Banda of Police who with no rugby back ground played for the national team with distinction.
With the clubs it is a different case as they have a limited membership and most of them come in the evening for a quiet drink or a game of poker or snooker. But forces should field their own men. They should mould ruggerites out of raw material and not depend on civilians to win matches for them.
Police team won many trophies with their own men and Air Force also won likewise. What have they achieved by fielding civilians except for one team.
When asked about women referees he said that they could hardly do anything. Tell one a woman in Sri Lanka who could handle the whistle. How can they do this where the men are struggling like the 'beep test'.
This is all none sense. They are termed as sub officials.
