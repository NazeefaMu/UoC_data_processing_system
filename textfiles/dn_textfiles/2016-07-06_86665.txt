Dias shaping the future of under 19 cricketers

Guiding the destiny of our under 19 cricketers and preparing them for the next under 19 cricket World Cup is former Sri Lanka batting great and vice-captain Roy Dias.
Dias has been handed the task of preparing a team of players good enough to make an impact in the under 19 World Cup if not win it.
His first task since been appointed to the post is the ongoing under 19 series against South Africa where Sri Lanka are playing a series of three youth tests and three youth one-day internationals.
Sri Lanka has held its own against a strong South African unit and held them to a nil-all draw in the three youth tests played at the P Sara Oval, Welegedara Stadium Kurunegala and at Pallekele.
“There are about four experienced guys other than that the rest are all playing for the first time at under 19 international level,” said Dias.
“They are quite good you have to expose them and give them more matches and see how they perform. My idea is to prepare them for the 2018 U19 World Cup which is in New Zealand. Right now we are playing the u19 boys but most of them are 17 plus and we need to give them the experience which is going to be important. I really involved in the last minute after the provincial under 19 tournament.”
According to Dias from the present squad includes four players who played in the last under 19 World Cup who won’t be eligible to play in the 2018 tournament. “We are playing the experienced guys so that the juniors can learn from them as well.”
Dias said that this was the first time he was handling an under 19 Sri Lanka squad. He had previously been head coach of the national senior team from 1998-1999 where they had mixed fortunes.
Sri Lanka had a successful tour of England in 1998 when they won the one-off Test at the Oval where Muthiah Muralitharan took 16 wickets and also the one-day tri-series that involved England and South Africa. Then on the tour to Australia in 1999 Muralitharan was called again in that infamous incident at Adelaide involving captain Arjuna Ranatunga and Australian umpire Ross Emerson. This was followed by a poor World Cup in 1999 where Sri Lanka failed to defend their crown which led to Dias getting the sack.
“I thought coaching the under 19 boys was a good opportunity for me because I feel you have to start at the grassroot level. I have been doing that in other countries and when I showed interest Sri Lanka Cricket gave me the job, it’s a one year contract which is renewable,” said Dias.
After his playing career was over Dias kept his links with cricket alive by setting up an academy for talented players in Colombo. He made a name for himself in the field of coaching when he was signed up by the Nepal Cricket Board as coach of both the senior and the junior sides in 2001. For the next eight years or so he was Nepal’s guiding light helping them to produce remarkable results.
They were Plate runners-up at the U-19 World Cup in 2002, beating Pakistan and Bangladesh before losing in the final to Zimbabwe.
They won the Asian Cricket Council (ACC) Youth Asia Cup in Karachi and qualified for the U-19 World Cup in 2004, and memorably beat South Africa and New Zealand to lift the Plate Championship in Sri Lanka in 2006. Dias’ efforts were recognised by the King of Nepal Gyanendra, who awarded him the Prabal Gorkha Dakshin Bahu (IV Class), an honour which is equivalent to a knighthood or OBE. After his stint with Nepal, Dias subsequently coached the Oman and Malaysian teams. Dias was unquestionably one of Sri Lanka’s first great batsmen whose career unfortunately divided between the pre-Test and post-Test era so that the international arena never had the opportunity of witnessing his fine technique and classic strokeplay especially his cover driving. By the time Sri Lanka became a fully-fledged Test nation and played their inaugural Test against England at the P Sara Oval in 1982 Dias was nearly 30. However for the next five years before his early enforced retirement his experience and skills were to prove of inestimable value to his country. He was a classically correct strokemaker, capable of both attack and defence, depending upon the circumstances and unlike many of his compatriots, equally comfortable against both pace and spin.
Two of his finest innings came in 1982 scoring a classic 109 on a fast Lahore pitch with Imran Khan at his best and the knock of 97 on a wearing Chennai (Madras then) pitch against India’s spinners.
Following Sri Lanka’s disappointing 1987 World Cup campaign Dias was one of a number of players who was discarded for both Test and one-day matches by the selectors. His final innings for his country was 80 against England in the 1987 World Cup. It was a sad end for a man who had done so much to make his nation competitive over the years since their admittance into international competition.
Dias was over 35 by this time, but he still appeared to have much to offer in the five-day game, and it seems unfortunate that his Test-match place was lost largely on the back of poor limited-overs results.
Dias’ final Test batting average of 36.71 is perhaps not overly impressive when viewed in isolation, but it fails to capture his immense contribution to a young and inexperienced team. He is still the fastest Sri Lankan to 1000 Test runs, getting there in just 23 innings, which ranks in front of legendary players such as Mahela Jayawardene and Kumar Sangakkara.
Dias’ next task with the Sri Lanka under 19 cricketers is a tour of England from July 17 where they are scheduled to play two under 19 youth tests and three under 19 youth ODIs.
“Although it is an under 19 series the cut-off date for players is March 31, 1996 so it is more or less an under 20 side that England will be fielding,” said Dias.
“Sri Lanka Cricket has given permission to play boys who will be 19 plus because we have to play good cricket. We can’t take a junior side and play an England team which is under 20,” he said.
“It’s a good thing because some of the under 19 boys who have finished with the under 19 World Cup gets another chance to play good cricket.”
Dias, a product of St Peter’s College said that it was difficult to compare the school cricket standards then and now.
“These guys are playing quite a lot of cricket than we did. We hardly played any cricket at all we had about eight school matches for the season. These boys are getting more cricket and more exposure. I don’t think the standards have fallen,” said Dias. “The side given to me is quite a good one and my job is to get them to the next level.”
