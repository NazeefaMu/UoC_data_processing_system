Strict action against those overstaying illegally in Israel : Thalatha

Strict legal action will be taken against those who are living illegally in Israel after completing their employment contracts, said Foreign Employment Minister Thalatha Athukorala.
She made this observation at a function held recently at the Sri Lanka Foreign Employment Agency to hand over air tickets to 22 Sri Lankans who have been granted with jobs in the agriculture sector in Israel.
Addressing the occasion, Minister Athukorale stressed the necessity of returning to Sri Lanka once the contract period is complete, adding that around 59 Sri Lankans currently reside there illegally.
There is a considerable growth in the number of job opportunities received from Israel to Sri Lanka compared to 2015, due to the successful discussions held by Athukorala with relevant authorities in Israel during her visit to Israel in 2016.
Around 201 Sri Lankans have been granted job opportunities in Israel from January up to now, and around 369 Sri Lankans have been granted jobs in the agriculture sector in Israel in 2016. Only 85 Sri Lankans have been selected to work in Israel in 2015.
Job opportunities in Israel are granted through the Sri Lanka Foreign Employment Agency and a Memorandum of Understanding has also been signed between the two countries to recruit caregivers from Sri Lanka and the first batch comprising eight caregivers have already left to Israel.
