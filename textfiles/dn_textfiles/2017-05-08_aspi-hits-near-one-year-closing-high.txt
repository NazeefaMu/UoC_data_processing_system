Point of view
The market rally which started in late-March continued its uptrend this week too, with the Bourse edging up to a near 1-year high to close at 6640.57 points on Friday.
Active buying interest in the Banking, Finance & Insurance, Manufacturing & Power & Energy counters helped the main index gain ~30 points W-o-W despite some profit taking early in the week. The benchmark price index’s 6 consecutive weeks of gains have added a cumulative~644 points to the index, and has helped the Index gain 6.6% Y-T-D (cf. 4.6% loss for the same period last year) while helping wipe off earlier losses on the Index.
Although lower than last week’s contribution of 41%, crossings over the week accounted for ~30% of market turnover, with Pan Asia Power contributing to 45% of the week’s total crossings.
Comparatively lower HNI participation this week therefore led the average turnover levels falling 46% W-o-W to end at LKR 0.73Bn (~19% lower than the year’s average turnover levels of LKR 0.90Bn).
Net Foreign inflows however, continued to be in the green for the 14th consecutive week (although average net inflows declined by ~90% W-o-W) bringing the total net inflows for the year to ~16Bn.
Similar market momentum is likely in the week ahead and could to be influenced by the direction of Mar’17 corporate earnings.
Jan trade deficit widens as oil imports grow
The trade deficit in January 2017 widened to $934Mn (cf. $691Mn Jan’16) driven by a 13.2% Y-o-Y increase in Import expenses as oil imports rose 101.6% Y-o-Y.
Oil imports rose over the month both due to increased volumes needed for thermal power generation (due to the drought) and increasing global oil prices.
Export earnings meanwhile declined 3.8% Y-o-Y amid slower demand for textiles and garments (49% of total export earnings) in both traditional and non-traditional markets. Continued momentum in tourist receipts (12.9% Y-o-Y to $376.3Mn) however, helped offset slower Worker remittances and net portfolio outflows (from equities and debt) over January.
The IMF meanwhile, announced that it would undertake the 2nd review under the EFF program in June 2017 as the new Inland Revenue Act is expected to be submitted to Parliament as a prior action by then.
The IMF added that the CBSL’s efforts to accumulate net international reserves as a corrective action for missing the end-2016 target is commendable and that this reserve accumulation should help reduce Sri Lanka’s external vulnerability.
The IMF also added that progress was being made in the country’s economic reform program particularly in improving the fiscal position, and that the new inland revenue act should enable durable fiscal consolidation that is based on revenue mobilization.
