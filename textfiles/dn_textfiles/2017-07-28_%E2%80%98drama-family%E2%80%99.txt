‘Drama family!’

Indomitable is a word that can be used to describe the thespians of Ananda College. These boys have gained a mastery of society mainly through their insights into life and behavior all achieved through drama. Dramatic Moves features Ananda College a bold group of dramatists who feel the pulse of society.
The Drama Circle was initiated in 2006 under the patronage of then-Principal Mr. B.A. Abeyratne, who invited Founding Director Mr. Nishantha de Silva to revive English theatre activities at Ananda College together with Master In-charge Mr. R. R. Rohana. The purpose of the Drama Circle was to improve the standards of English amongst the students whilst enhancing the school’s reputation for English language proficiency in wider society.
Understanding inner selves!
Master In-charge of the English Drama Circle and the English Literary Union, Coordinator of English Language and Literature, Rambukkanage Ranjith Rohana felt that doing drama can put the world at your feet!
“Through teaching drama I have gained the experience to identify different individuals and have developed a sensitivity to understand their inner selves. At the same time, it helps us widen the awareness of different spheres of the world while improving team consciousness to reach a common goal ultimately,” said Rohana.
Working with the boys is a very rewarding experience.
“Drama is a love presentation that showcases different aspects of life. It is a pleasing experience to work with these boys who are very efficient and dynamic people. Working with them promotes our potential to think of life in a novel way and understand current trends. Boys are innovative and they feature original ideas and strategies. It is a refreshing experience to work with a young team. They have plenty of physical and mental strength to face any difficult situation. Practising a play is not a bed of roses, but it is a long march on a path of thorny bushes. The boys have the potential to do the task,” explained Rohana.
Drama offers you the opportunity to master society.
“Drama is once again a live presentation that reflects human life and society at large. It also deals with actions, gestures and language skills. Drama is an event where actions speak rather than words. So I see those capabilities in these boys. They learn how to deal with real life situations. It promotes sensitivity and empathetic feelings towards their fellow men,” pointed out Rohana
“They develop confidence to face the audience and to face the society while improving their language skills along with performance capabilities. They also develop aesthetic faculties. Finally they learn to feel the pulse of the society - Their ability to face the society with confidence and promoting their ability to be sensitive. Drama also develops their powers of language in aesthetic situations,” he added further.
Building actors
Secretary Lakshitha Edirisinghe felt that a chief goal at Ananda is to raise thespians who appreciate the richness drama has to offer.
“One of our strengths is that our mindset is not entirely focused on making drama something competitive. What we focus on is building actors. Build people who have a passion and love for theatre. Through that we also establish drama to be a place where you come to have fun at the end of the day even though you do a certain amount of work. We don’t necessarily call ourselves the drama circle we call ourselves the drama family. We have a bond. So we don’t approach it with an entirely competitive mindset, but making it a place where you have fun,” said Edirisinghe.
Improving the English Language is definitely one of the benefits that the Drama boys of Ananda gained.
“Improving in English is not just talking or writing in English. It is also about the subtle things. So it has established us as better individuals. Drama is a very good way to learn about society. The moment you start to understand characters and the moment you start to study these specific roles, you recognize these people in society as well. You learn through the characters you enact. You identify a person doing a certain action and you give it your own interpretation,” added Edirisinghe.
Drama has taught Edirisinghe to love the simpler things in life. Look at things and appreciate things for what they are. All in all it has all been benefits.
It is all about family!
President Thilina Udayaratne stressed on the importance of leaving a legacy for others to follow.
“I joined the drama circle in 2010, and to be really honest, drama is the only place I find peace inside school.Drama is the place where there is least drama at school! It is all about family. It is not only about the technicalities. You learn to survive and go forwards as a team. Theatre is not all about competition. As the Drama Circle we make sure that we encourage all our youngsters to strive towards and take a more passionate approach to the theatre scene in Sri Lanka rather than just acting to win. Coming runners up in 2010 at Theatre Fest was a pleasing and delightful moment for all of us. As we grew year by year, we realized that doing this with the mindset of winning is not what we want. What we want is to leave behind a legacy where other people would look at us and understand that we do theatre for the love and passion we have for it,” said Udayaratne
Udayaratne pointed out that Ananda has progressed over the years with a bunch passionate and talented juniors and seniors. So what they want to do is to make this a collective, so that they ensure the audience that watches Ananda perform, has one heck of a day to remember. That is the goal.
“When we take part in the Drama Comp. organized by the Royal College Interact Club, what we do is we use the inter-house drama competition that happens prior to this at school. We take the four plays from the four houses. And we develop one of these plays into the drama comp. so what we do is, we don’t take our most senior and experienced actors and put them on stage. We experiment with the new talent we have and put them on stage giving them the chance to act and see how they perform. And from that we take it to drama comp. so that we take the young lot more than the most senior and experienced actors, so that the young ones get a chance. And that is the most fundamental thing. So you do drama for the love, and you share the love with each other. Because, for me drama is everything. That is the core insight I have gained,” explained Udayaratne.
