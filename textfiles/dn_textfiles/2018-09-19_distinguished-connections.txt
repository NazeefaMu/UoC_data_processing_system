Distinguished connections

The Japanese Cultural Exhibition 2018 was held last week with the usual enthusiasm and turnout. Once more various Japanese crafts were featured at the exhibition. On a sad note, Ambassador of Japan to Sri Lanka, Kenichi Suganuma attended his last Japanese Cultural Exhibition in Sri Lanka last Saturday at the premises of the Hotel School. It was no doubt a bittersweet occasion for the distinguished ambassador who has called Sri Lanka a home for quite some time. Now he will be returning back to Japan, and as one chapter closes in his life another one opens. He will return back to Japan to start another life in another vocation.
Ambassador of Japan to Sri Lanka, Kenichi Suganuma, said he is humbled and pleased to be a part of this exhibition which is being held for the third year at the hotel school.
Participating associations
“This is an opportunity for all to enjoy Japanese culture. I understand much effort has been put into this event and I must congratulate the Japanese Language Teachers Association and the participating associations. I am impressed by the fact that more and more Sri Lankans are taking an interest in Japanese culture and embracing it.
As a citizen of Japan, I am tremendously pleased that all these associations which are run by Sri Lankans, are promoting Japanese culture and that they are enjoying themselves in the process. That shows how the Japanese Culture has taken root in Sri Lanka,” said Suganuma.
He further stressed that the circulation and exchange of ideas through various discourses is doing a lot of good for both countries. New innovations will soon be introduced to our respective cultures through our interaction.
“The interaction between our two countries will usher in a new age as the world changes. This is how cultures develop and flourish. I am very glad that this exhibition is being held again. I have been here for more than three years and I see that there is an increase in activity taking place when you think of Japanese- Sri Lankan relations.
This is not only high-level visits on both sides, we have more Japanese companies coming into Sri Lanka. We see a lot of tourists coming to Sri Lanka from Japan and I see a definite increase in arrivals. We see Sri Lankans, in turn, going into Japan for various purposes. So many exchanges are taking place,” explained Suganuma.
Support and friendship
He also wished all involved great success and that his successor will soon take over from him. Suganuma said that he along with his wife have really enjoyed their stay in Sri Lanka.
“People have been so nice and we have visited beautiful places in Sri Lanka. The job has been very rewarding. Thank you for all your support and friendship. As for me, I may retire from the ministry and do something else. So we are leaving for Japan soon. My successor will no doubt continue this very good tradition that we have every year,” said Suganuma.
President of Japanese Language Teachers Association, Heshandrika Perera commented that diplomatic ties between Japan and Sri Lanka have existed for over 60 years.
“This annual event – the Japanese Cultural Exhibition, is organized by the Embassy of Japan in association with the Japanese Language Teachers Association of Sri Lanka. This gives us the opportunity of strengthening our ties of love and respect that we have towards each other. We hold a special place in each other’s hearts. We are teachers involved in teaching the Japanese language to Sri Lankan students that enables them to communicate with the Japanese people thereby enabling them to learn more about Japan and Japanese culture,” stated Perera.
Perera stated that we all know that the Japanese have preserved their culture which spans thousands of years and has seen new economic and technological changes.
“This event will open one’s eyes to a vibrant, proud and rich culture alive in all it wondrous ways. A culture that has mesmerized the outside world and been an inspiration,” said Perera.
