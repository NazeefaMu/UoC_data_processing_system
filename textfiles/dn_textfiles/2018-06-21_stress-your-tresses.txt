Stress On your tresses

Just as healthy and voluminous hair can boost your ego, hair loss can make you end up feeling pretty low. Hair loss or thinning has become a common problem among working women today. Follow these guidelines to help keep your hair on and attain luscious and lustrous locks. 
Losing hair every day 
The average woman loses between 50 and 100 strands per day, even up to 150 in some cases.
Excessive hair loss causes 
Androgenetic hair loss is seen in both men and women but is more dramatic in men.
Thyroid disease, anemia, protein deficiency, chemotherapy, and low vitamin levels may cause hair loss. Alopecia is a form of hair loss produced by the autoimmune destruction of hair follicles in localized areas of skin. 
Medications and hair loss 
Many different types of drugs are thought to cause hair loss, including: Acne medications containing vitamin A (retinoid) Antibiotics and antifungal drugs.
High blood pressure medications (anti-hypertensive), such as beta-blockers, ACE inhibitors, and diuretics too can result in hair loss.
Thin hair 
Telogen effluvium is temporary hair thinning over the scalp that occurs because of changes in the growth cycle of hair.
A large number of hairs enter the resting phase at the same time, causing hair shedding and subsequent thinning. Scarring alopecia results in permanent loss of hair.
Hair and scalp analysis 
During a hair and scalp analysis a live video microscope is used whereby magnified images of the scalp, hair and hair follicles are viewed on an in-room monitor to assess your hair follicles health, PH and sebum levels. This helps to identify the cause such as styling product build-up, bacteria and fungus, DHT enzyme symptoms, sebum build-up and lack of hair nutrition of your specific hair loss condition.
Hair transplant 
Hair transplantation is a surgical technique that removes hair follicles from one part of the body, called the ‘donor site’, to a bald or balding part of the body known as the ‘recipient site’. The technique is primarily used to treat male pattern baldness. In this minimally invasive procedure, grafts containing hair follicles that are genetically resistant to balding, (like the back of the head) are transplanted to the bald scalp. Hair transplantation can also be used to restore eyelashes, eyebrows, beard hair, and chest hair.
Laser technology and hair loss 
The hair regrowth process can be stimulated with low-level laser light therapy. This process involves the use of photons, which are irradiated into scalp tissue to restore health in weakened cells in the hair follicles.
