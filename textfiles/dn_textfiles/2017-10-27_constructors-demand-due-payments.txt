Constructors demand due payments

A discussion was organised between members of the National Construction Association of Sri Lanka and Chief Secretary of the Northern Provincial Council H.M.P. Bandara on Wednesday. At the meeting the constructors had requested authorities to settle payments due to them for construction works carried out as soon as possible. Members said that they have faced many problems as they haven’t received payments in time and it is necessary to solve the matter without any further delay.
