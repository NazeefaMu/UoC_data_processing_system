Cattle should not be allowed to stray : Patali

Megapolis and Western Development Minister Patali Champika Ranawaka has requested owners of dairies and cattle sheds in Colombo and suburbs to ensure that their cattle are not released and allowed to stray onto the roads. Officers of the relevant institutions and other authorities have been requested to remove cattle straying onto the roads in the Colombo, Dehiwala, Mount Lavinia, Moratuwa, Kotte and Kaduwela Municipal Council areas and other Pradeshiya Sabha and Local Council areas.
Cattle owners should obtain a permit from the relevant Municipal or Local Council to maintain cattle sheds in such areas. A postmortem conducted on a cow whose carcass was found on a street recently showed that its stomach contents included more than 20 kilos of polythene.
