Labour TU calls to provide maternity benefits equally

The National Labour Advisory Council (NLAC) Trade Union yesterday urged the government to rectify the discrepancy between the government and private sector on maternity benefits for female employees.
NLAC Trade Union Co-Chairman Anton Marcus, addressing a media briefing held in Colombo, said the discrepancy occurs both ways. He said that several maternity benefits enjoyed by public sector female employees are not entitled to private sector female workers.
Although female employees in the public sector are entitled to maternity leave of 84 days, excluding weekends and public holidays, private sector female workers are entitled only to 84 days, including weekends and public holidays.
“This is unfair. The two Acts; the Maternity Benefits Ordinance and Shop and Office Employees Act, which are applicable to woman employees in the private sector, grant 84 days of maternity leave for only the first and second child births while granting only 42 days of maternity leave for the 3rd child birth or subsequent child births,” he said.
“Furthermore, under the Maternity Benefits Act, a woman worker in the estate sector gets only three fourths of the maternity benefits whereas woman workers in other sectors receive full benefits.”
He said only women workers covered by the Maternity Benefits Ordinance are entitled to feeding intervals. Women workers covered by the Shop and Office Employees Act are not entitled to feeding intervals.
Under the Maternity Benefits Ordinance, employers should allow women workers feeding intervals of two hours.
He added that the ILO had stipulated that there should be no anomalies or discrepancy in granting maternity benefits.
