Battle against dark forces

People came from all over the world for the tea and an exciting talk with questions from writer Ashok Ferry with Herman Gunaratne about his latest book on curses and black magic, God's Secret Agent, which was launched in huge style on Easter day in the gorgeous setting of Mirissa Hills art gallery and bungalow grounds. Opened by a marching band up the hill and filmed by all the television media stations and this exciting talk was hotly debated afterwards over Handungoda premium teas and home made cinnamon biscuits, which as one group who came from Ireland put it was the most exciting book launch they had ever been to. In fact they can't wait for Herman to do a book tour of Ireand and the UK to discuss why as The Sunday Times put it 'The Demons are out of the bottle."
Truth as we all know is often stranger than fiction and so it is in this world where the devil dupes mankind over and over again into thinking he is god. Herman sets out on a journey over the last year to produce a book on a subject no one really feels comfortable talking about, particularly in the west, as it is one of the last real taboos: curses. This extraordinary book is the true story of a doubting Thomas in the world of Ceylon witchcraft or ‘mumbo jumbo’ as Herman likes to call it. Only, the mumbo jumbo in this book is very real and is all about bottles, hair, deadly stethoscopes, inhuman screams, bloody goats’ heads appearing from graveyards, snakes conjured out of thin air, demonic possessions with smatterings of holy water, prayers leading to visions and plenty of digging that would leave even crime writer Agatha Christie shaken to her core.
It is also the story of the power of two great religions, not in collision but working together to take on a whole host of demons that call themselves gods. This is not a new thing for the word demon is derived from the Greek for god and so ultimately it is about the one true God.
Herman’s stories in ‘God’s Secret Agent’ are not limited to the lower echelons of society, where most people think that witchcraft abounds still, simply in the imagination of the poorly educated and ignorant. No, these stories span the entire spectrum of the people of Sri Lanka from top to bottom of the island and go as far as how even a president was cursed during the civil war. It is a fascinating journey about a small band of people travelling through many dark places, both physically and spiritually.
But the main character of the story, besides notorious Galle white tea planter Herman, is the humble exorcist, a man from one great religion casting devils out in the name of another. His story is truly astonishing and one that would be considered too farfetched if it had been made up. Herman is a great storyteller with an even greater story to tell so do stop and talk to him about it if you see him at one of the many festival events. The question is why, do we think, has he left writing this book for his twilight years. Is it because he was afraid of what might happen to him or was it to protect some of the characters in the book still living? Maybe it is just that he didn’t think anyone would believe him before, or maybe a combination of all three? Herman wanted to call the book ‘In the name of God’ and we agonised over whether to indeed give it that name, for God must have the last word and this debate continues. However, we settled with ‘God’s Secret Agent’ although we were tempted to call it the God brothers as in some ways the book has Blues Brother energy to it.
The stories are not about conventional religious wisdom; rather they are about evil spirits and good spirits and the war between them with humans as purely the vehicles and supplicants for their motivation. The name is also perhaps more reflective of Sri Lanka’s current status with witchcraft, where the country on one level, seems to be the Devil’s playground, some say since being re-named Sri Lanka in 1974. But ultimately the book is about hope and faith and the power of GOD.
