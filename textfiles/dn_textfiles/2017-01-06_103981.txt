Govt failed to engage China in a diplomatic manner: Ven Samitha Thera

The government’s failure to engage China in a diplomatic manner had driven the country into a deep abyss today, Southern Provincial Member Ven. Baddegama Samitha Thera said. Addressing a press conference in Galle, Ven.Samitha Thera said former President Mahinda Rajapaksa who identified China as an economic giant negotiated with it on the diplomatic front to obtain necessary finding for development. “When one acted undiplomatically with China, it was bent on creating Chinese colonies the world over because the country was unable to cope with a teeming population. Ven.Samitha said the government had coined the term neo-liberalism to describe its economic policies. Neo-liberalism was being rejected all over the world today. “Through neo-liberalism the government was trying to transform the country into a cat’s paw of powerful nations. Although the government was bragging about a Right to Information Act the agreements.
Signed by it were never transparent. He alleged that the government had undermined democracy by trying all means possible to postpone local elections.
“Democracy today had become a mere propaganda slogan. People should unite and rise up to oppose government moves to sell off the country,” the Thera said.
