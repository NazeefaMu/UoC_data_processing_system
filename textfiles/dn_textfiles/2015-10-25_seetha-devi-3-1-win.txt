Seetha Devi in 3-1 win

Seetha Devi Girls College, Kandy put up a superlative performance to defeat the visiting Queen Margaret College (London) United Kingdom 3-1 in a thriller in a hockey match played at the University Grounds, Peradeniya. At half time the scores were deadlocked at one all.
The standard of hockey rose to high standards and the visiting girls put up a gritty performance on a grass court which they are not familiar. They could have even reversed the results if this match was played on astro turf where they could have had better ball control.
Seetha Devian drew first blood when centre forward Shenali Fernando scooped a pass to centre half Charuka Abeyratne who sounded the boards.
But hardly had the shouting died down the visitors fought back to equalise through centre forward Amelia Gayodan. With the scores level the teams went for lemon.
The second half saw a bitter fight with the visiting team more on the offensive.
On one such occasion Seetha Devi's right back Madhumali Karunatilleke decided to have a go and with a long and strong drive caught the visiting team's defence on the wrong foot. Madhumali's strong drive converted into a pass was collected by centre forward Tharaki Paranagama who in turn took play into the semi circle and beat the visiting teams custodian to score.
Seetha Devi's third goal too was fashioned by right back Madhumali Karunatillake whose desperate clearance reached substitute centre forward Ahimsa Devatillini who sold a ‘dummy’ to the visiting defence to score.
J.G. Prakash and Nataraja Paraneetharan umpired.
