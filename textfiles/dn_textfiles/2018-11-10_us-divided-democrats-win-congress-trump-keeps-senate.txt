US Divided: Democrats win Congress, Trump keeps Senate

Change has come to American politics and governance. The midterm election this week gave the Democrats a majority in the Congress, while the Trump led Republicans retained control of the Senate. The midterm election held two years after Donald Trump’s election as US President, is considered a referendum of President Trump’s governance in the past two years, and did show a turn of the public against President Trump, in what was a very divisive election in the United States.
The new challenge to Donald Trump comes from the Democrat’s controlling the Congress, which is a major change from when the Republicans controlled both the Congress and the Senate since Trump won the presidency in 2016. The results and the big rise in the number of voters in a midterm have shown the Americans using the ballot box to express their democratic opposition to the Trump presidency.
The Democrats can now question and object to the legislative plans of President Trump, with many questions being raised on the Republican policies on economic affairs, money bills, and seek better medical facilities to the people.
However, by retaining control of the Senate, getting a few more seats there, President Trump will have the facilities to appoint new judges to the Supreme Court, a matter which certainly influenced the poll after the appointment of Judge Brett Kavanaugh as a member of the Supreme Court.
Despite the large Democratic gains, President Trump remained proud at the record of the poll, especially of the Republicans having control of the Senate. Most Republican candidates to the Senate who were openly supported by President Trump won the race. In one of the most divisive polls in the country, the message of Trump on racism, anti-immigration, and what is being seen as ‘white nationalism’ has stressed importance in the American thinking. This is cause for great satisfaction to President Trump, who saw his supporters remain with him, and a sharp increase in supporters of Trump policies.
It is significant that Trump did not campaign on the success of his economic policies. He was silent on the rise of the economy, the increase of the employment with a continuing fall of unemployment, which would be very encouraging to the average US voters. Instead, he campaigned on racism, anti-immigration, and the overall right wing policies that were opposed to the policies of his predecessor in office, President Barack Obama.
Women’s role
The role of women in the politics in the US has made significant progress with at least 100 women being elected to the member House of Representatives. The Democrat control of the House will lead to checks and balances on the policies of the Republican Presidency, and more constitutional controls on presidential actions. A record number of women were elected to Congress as an unprecedented number of female candidates ran for the first time, marking an all-time high for the number of women in the legislatures.
The poll saw the election of the youngest woman, two Muslim women and two Native American women to the Congress. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, 29 years, the youngest elected to US Congress, is one of the biggest stars in this election. She describes herself as a democratic socialist, she defeated a long-time Democratic Representative in the party primaries. She won the race to the New York Congressional District with over 75 percent of the vote.
Another significant win for women and the Democrats was 36-year-old Ilhan Omar, a Muslim refugee born in Somalia, grew up partly in Dadaab, one of the world’s largest refugee camps in Kenya, and then moved to the US with her family, when aged 14, in 1995. The mother of three, who was elected to the State Legislature in Minnesota in 2016, and then ran for the Congress from the Democratic Party. This will be the first African-American Muslim refugee woman to be elected to the Congress.
The other Muslim woman elected to Congress is the Michigan Democrat Rashida Tlaib, endorsed by the Democratic Socialists of America, a rising left-wing group that also includes the youngest women elected from New York, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez.
Another big change was the election of two Native American women to the Congress. A political novice Sharice Davids, is a member of the Ho-Chunk Nation, won from Kansas and would be the State’s first Native American Congresswomen. She is also the first LGBT congressional representative.
Another Native American to win, also Democrat, is Donna Shalala from Florida. A former Health and Human Services secretary in the Clinton Administration, stood on a platform for ‘common-sense gun reform, support for higher education, environmental protection and affordable healthcare. Her strong campaigning said that, until every child has a fair shot at a higher education… and unless this heartless administration is held accountable for their numerous injustices, we will not stop.
President remains strong
President Donald Trump remained strong with the Republican control of the Senate, and gaining more seats too, although Democrats won control of the Congress. He was clear that the midterm election was a referendum on the record of his work. He has said that his name is on the ballot, to show how much the election is based on his policies. He took credit for the victory of the Republicans who he supported, and mocked those who lost for not taking his support by stating they refused his ‘embrace’. The Republican winnings were largely in white areas, helping fuelling in the divisive campaign, which sees America sharply divided on race, religion and immigrant people.
He was hugely involved in the poll campaign, and in the last two weeks went to the campaign rallies of a few candidates who were supportive of his policies, and many of them won re-election to the Senate. Trump ignored the success of his economic policies in the past two years and instead pushed the fearful message about immigrants, in keeping with his agenda in the presidential campaign. He made repeated warning of the would be refugees coming in what is called a caravan approaching the US from South America, coming from Honduras, San Salvador, Nicaragua coming through Mexico.
Trump gave emphasis on what was called migrant ‘invasion’, warning people that the bedraggled caravan of asylum seekers is a coming invasion, and ordered US troops to the US-Mexico border. His comments were often nakedly racist, and also sought to frighten voters on future threats to security. A significant slogan by Trump in his campaign was “If you want more caravans, if you want more crime, vote Democrat tomorrow”.
He also showed little concern about the toxic effect of his continued rhetoric in the campaign, which many critics say fuelled the recent parcel bomb attacks that were directed at leading Democrats, former Presidents Bill Clinton and Barack Obama, former vice president and the CNN TV service, and philanthropist Michael Soros. It is significant that during this increasingly heated campaign that a Jewish Synagogue in Pittsburgh was attacked by a man using guns, killing 11 Jewish persons. He also said of the need to abolish the ‘birth right citizenship’, where children of foreigners who are born in the US are entitled to citizen under the Constitution.
President Trumps feeling of success, and his understanding of a new tough approach in politics and approach to the public was seen in the Press Conference he gave at the White House, after the poll results were coming in. He was boastful of the victory in the Senate, especially in the States where he campaigned. His anger in the political developments was clearly displayed in the manner in which he verbally attacked the CNN reporter Jim Acosta, who asked some questions, by repeatedly and forcefully asking him to sit down, and give up his microphone. After that open and ugly clash as a meeting with the media, the White House pass of this correspondent has also been withdrawn. The White House reporters have already condemned the decision to bar Acosta from the White House.
Another important result of the middy-term election is the removal of the US Attorney General, Jeff Sessions, who was one of the first key personalities to support Trump in his presidential campaign, the questions raised by the removal of the Attorney General is what action the President would take to possibly stop the probe by special counsel Robert Mueller, on alleged Russian action to support Donald Trump in his presidential poll.
It is a largely divided America that will be active after this election, with major changes taking place in the increased participation of the people in midterm voting.
It will also see the impact of the new role of women, especially educated women, in the politics of the US, as well as the increased role of the racial minorities, Black Americans, Latin Americans and Asian Americans in the politics and governance of the country. Donald Trump remains President, and has already stated his decision to run for the presidency in 2020, with the same Vice President, Mike Pence. The American politics will be of increased interest globally in the coming weeks and months.
