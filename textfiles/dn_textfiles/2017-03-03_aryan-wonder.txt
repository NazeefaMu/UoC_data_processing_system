Aryan wonder

Archaeological evidence reveals that every major civilization has maintained cross-cultural interactions for their survival. Since the era of explorations, migrations, imperial expansions and long distance trade expeditions, invasions seeking spices and raw material and spreading religious beliefs and cultural traditions had laid the foundation in the formation of cosmopolitan societies throughout the globe.
During this era, people representing numerous countries met, mingled, interacted and maintained trade links with each other. These Global interactions had provided invaluable opportunities in sharing cultural, linguistic and religious traditions of other civilizations.
At the same time majority of ancient civilizations disappeared due to natural causes or destroyed and replaced by alien civilizations. This had been a continuous process since the origin of mankind.
Mass exodus of nomadic and pastoral people speaking Indo-European languages identifying themselves as ‘Aryans’ migrated to the Indian subcontinent. At the beginning, their migration appeared to be an invasion. According to the research findings of archaeologists these foreigners had migrated to the Indian subcontinent around 1500 BC through the passes of the Hindu Kush mountains.
Indus Valley Civilization
According to A L Basham, the Professor of Asian Civilization and the writer of the well- known book The Wonder that was India the great steppe land stretching from Poland to Central Asia was inhabited by semi-nomadic barbarians who were tall, comparatively fair and mostly long-headed. Referring to Indo-Europeans, they migrated in bands westwards, southwards and eastwards conquering indigenous populations and inter-marrying with them in forming a ruling class.
Their migration had coincided with the declining stages of the Indus Valley Civilization due to internecine conflicts and environmental degradations. There could have been instances that the original inhabitants of the Indus Valley clashed with the Indo-European migrants.
Some of the historians of Indology put forward diverse theories on the Aryan migration and interpreted it as an invasion. Aryans had been branded as tribal, martial and pastoral people hailed from Central Asia. They created fear phobia in the minds of the native inhabitants as they drove their horse-drawn chariots across the Indian subcontinent destroying what remained in the Harappa cities and irrigations channels found along their way.
Many centuries after their arrival inter-marriages took place between the Dravidians and Indo-Europeans and the gradual assimilation, the integration and the continuous interaction maintained between both the cultures had a lasting impact on social, cultural, political and religious spheres of the indigenous communities found scattered in the Indian subcontinent.
Mythological counterparts
The Aryans brought with them an Indo-European language known as the Vedic Sanskrit language which was also identified as the sacred and the classical language of ancient India. The descendants of the speakers of Indo-European languages are comprised of the populations of Nepal, Pakistan, Northern India and Bangladesh. In addition to Sanskrit numerous other languages are spoken throughout the northern portion of the subcontinent and on the Islands of Sri Lanka and Maldives.
The Indo-Aryans were responsible in introducing alien religious concepts comprised of a pantheon of naturalistic or functional gods, traditions of ritualistic cult practices , the sacrificial use of fire and an intoxicating drink called ‘Soma’.
Soma was a plant believed to be found in the North-Western Mountains and its juice was extracted and used as a stimulant having hallucinatory effects in the Vedic ritual drink especially among the Indo-Iranian priests and an entire book of Rig Veda was dedicated to Soma sacrifice.
Some of the gods mentioned in the scriptures of the Indo-Aryans are also found to have mythological counterparts in other Indo –European traditions of Iran, Greece, and Rome. These similarities can be considered as clear indicators of common origin of such gods in ancient times.
Max Muller a German national renown as a Sanskrit scholar, a philologist and a pioneer in Vedic studies maintained that the Aryans had originated in the Central Asia and one branch had migrated to Europe and another band of Aryans settled down in Iran and another segment of the Iranian branch and later moved to India.
Advanced poetic techniques
The Aryans on their arrival in the Indian Subcontinent were engaged in rearing horses, cattle, sheep and goats. Horses proved to be more valuable because horses did not breed in India. The Aryans replenished their supplies of horse meat by importing horses from Central Asia.
The Aryans harnessed horses to carts or wagons helping them in reaching long distant locations speedily. Horse driven chariots appeared to be devastating war machines and effective in creating fear phobia in the minds of the indigenous communities of Indian Subcontinent.
Cattle became the measure of wealth of Indo-Aryans and calculated prices in terms of cattle. Farmers of Indo-Aryans prayed to gods requesting to increase the number of cattle. The Indo- Aryan priests engaged in sacrificial rituals were usually rewarded with cattle for their services.
In addition to the Indo-European concepts of religion of the Aryans , they were also comprised of other religious traditions of indigenous communities in a modified form which they gathered in the course of their eastward migrations. The religion of the Aryans thus developed since their arrival in Indian subcontinent until 500 B.C. was embodied in a collection of Hymns, Ritual texts, and Philosophical treatises called Vedas.
The Aryan priests possessed very advanced poetic techniques which they used in composing religious hymns intended to be sung praising their gods during sacrifices.
Since the era of the establishment of the Aryan settlements the ‘Brahmin’ priests developed, celebrated and interpreted an elaborate schemes of sacrifices. These priests had settled down mainly in East Punjab in the region between Satlaj and the river Yamuna. Later this region was known as ‘Brahmavarta’. Rituals had been conducted on daily basis assuring long life, progeny and prosperity. Their leaders were also assured victory in battle. Indo-Aryan priests also played a dominant role in restructuring Aryan society.
The Hindus regarded the Veda as a body of eternal and revealed scriptures and embodying the essential truths of Hinduism.
Fire sacrifice
Rig Veda is the earliest section of the Vedic Corpus and the composition of the later Vedic Corpus –the Sama, Yajur and Atharva Vedas are generally dated to the first half of the first millennium B.C.
Rig Veda is the earliest text of hymns of the Vedic Corpus deals on the Aryan religion. It is comprised of 1.028 hymns and identified as the oldest religious literature in the world. The Veda is known as ‘sruti’ inspired or heard by ancient seers. The Hindus the world across consider Rig Veda as the most sacred religious text. The deities mentioned in the Rig Veda were personifications of natural forces.
God Indra referred to as ‘ eka deva’ ( One God) and venerated as pre-eminent and the core myth of Rig Veda recounted his deeds. According to this central myth, creation proceeded when Indra who was considered as the champion of the celestial gods slew a serpent demon known as ‘ Vritra’ who enclosed the waters and the sun required for the human beings.
According to this myth when Indra split opened the belly of this demon the essentials of creation such as moisture, heat, light were released. Thus the cosmic order ‘rita’ had been established, under the administration of the god Varuna.
Ritual based on a fire sacrifice personified as the god Agni. The Vedic Aryans lived closed to nature as a part of it. The vastness and the brilliance of nature, its blessings and maledictions, its inexorable and subtly operating law which dominated all its manifestations dominated the Aryan religious ideology. :
The Samhita section of each is a collection of hymns and Brahmanas are detailed explanations relevant to rituals.
The Upanishads and the Aranyakas are philosophical discourse which is also considered as a form of Vedic Corpus.
The hymns were memorized and transmitted orally over a period of many centuries before being committed to writing.
