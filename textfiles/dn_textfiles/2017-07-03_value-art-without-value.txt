The value of art without value

Ben Lerner’s 10:04 is not a conventional novel. It is a brilliant, piecemeal collection of entwining narratives; the book succeeds on the strength of its beautifully lucid stories, but one in particular leaves a lasting impression. In it, Lerner’s nameless narrator is invited to visit the “Institute for Totaled Art” – a collection of once-valuable artworks declared legally worthless for insurance purposes, housed in his on-off girlfriend’s Brooklyn apartment.
“It was wonderful to see an icon of art world commercialism and valorised stupidity shattered”, the narrator, who closely resembles Lerner, declares after holding the small fragments of a broken Jeff Koons Balloon Dog, once worth thousands of pounds, but now officially “worthless”.
The Balloon Dog, like all the works in the institute, had been declared a “total loss” by insurers. When a valuable piece of art is damaged – dropped, torn, burnt or otherwise – to the extent that the owner of the work and an appraiser agree that it cannot be restored, or the cost of the restoration would be too high, it is totalled. The insurer pays out the value of the work, which is then legally declared “zero value”. But these works are not destroyed. Instead they are left in vast warehouses by the insurers, “demoted from art to mere objecthood and banned from circulation, removed from the market, relegated to this strange limbo”, in the words of Lerner’s narrator.
Quick to judge
It is this limbo that prompted the Polish-American artist Elka Krajewska to set up the Salvage Art Institute (SAI), on which Lerner based his story. In 2012, the institute staged its first exhibition, No Longer Art, in New York, after securing a number of totalled art works from AXA Art, one of the world’s biggest art insurance firms. Since then it has grown, with an essay collection expected next year and a new exhibition at BNKR Space in Munich in November. The SAI explores the phenomenon of “No Longer Art” – Krajewska’s preferred term for written off pieces – and the questions it poses. When is art beyond repair? Are we too quick to judge art by its monetary value? What separates art from “objecthood”?
The first question is not as clear as it may seem. Although a total loss is declared when an insurer and owner agree that a piece is unsalvageable, there are instances where the owner’s sentimental valuation and the insurer’s commercial valuation collide. Julia Nagle, one of London’s most respected art conservators, has dealt with a number of such instances. While she was conserving art part-time in Cambridge, a professor of philosophy brought her a set of Voodoo paintings, bought from an artist in Haiti, but later damaged in a fire. “The paintings themselves were not high value”, she says. “But to him they were because they’re one off things.”
The cost of restoration outstripped the value of the paintings, so the insurer offered to pay out as a total loss on the works, but this meant the professor would have to hand the paintings over, even though they were irreplaceable. “It is really hard, I think, if people are very emotionally attached to things and they’re not of huge value”, Nagle adds. “You can’t get a total payout and then keep the artwork.” In the end this is what mattered to the professor, who rejected the payout and paid for restoration of the works himself.
Zero value
The difficulty in establishing whether a piece is a total loss or not is compounded by the fact that insurers often try to restore works once they have been totalled, in order to recoup some of their losses. This presents a problem for the SAI, which sets out to “maintain the zero-value of no longer art” in its manifesto.
“There was an Ed Ruscha painting in the AXA London office, that has since disappeared – meaning that it has probably been resold”, explains Krajewska. The institute will place markers at its Munich exhibition, showing where pieces of the collection would be sitting if they had not been resold by the insurers.
Works that are given a second life by insurers usually end up at auction houses where “caveat emptor” reigns – the onus is always on the buyer to establish the history of anything for sale. Reports commissioned by the auction houses may mention the fact that restoration has taken place, but they do not have to specify that it was ever a total loss. This gives fluidity to the definition of totalled art.
“I think in every insurer’s office there are specialists actually working on how to place those works back into the market and so we’re trying to catch them before that happens,” Krajewska says. “It’s a difficult process and whatever we get as donation [means] it automatically becomes easier, but sometimes our activity with the work is temporary.”
