HOW TO GET QUALITY BEAUTY SLEEP

When it comes to an effective beauty regime, the tips are endless. But the one thing you never hear enough about is the most important factor of all: beauty sleep!
Sleep is essential for the wellness of your mind, body, and soul. It’s your internal fountain of youth and a key element to beauty.
How exactly does sleep affect the way your skin looks? Rebecca S. Robbins, co-author of the book Sleep for Success!, explains that during a good night’s sleep, your body removes dead blood cells and other toxins that can build up in the skin.
USE A HUMIDIFIER IN YOUR BEDROOM
Hydration is what keeps skin buoyant and fresh. But when you spend all night fast asleep, you aren’t hydrating by drinking water. As a result, your skin loses vital moisture.
To help prevent skin dehydration, run a humidifier in your bedroom. Humidifiers work by taking water from a series of chambers and pushing it into the air, making that air less dry and, therefore, gentler on your skin. For the best hydration results, turn on the humidifier after you apply a night cream.
USE AROMATHERAPY TO WAKE UP ENERGIZED
Aromatherapy can be an effective aid for getting adequate beauty sleep. The scent of lavender, in particular, can help improve sleep patterns. According to a 2005 study conducted by Wesleyan University, lavender had a four-fold effect on test subjects:It increased the percentage of deep, or slow-wave (SWS), sleep in both men and women.It increased stage 2 (light) sleep.It decreased rapid-eye-movement (REM).It decreased the amount of time to wake after first falling asleep.
Overall, subjects reported more energy in the morning after lavender exposure. The study concluded that the smell of lavender can be used to promote deep sleep.
There are two ways to take advantage of aromatherapy. The simplest way is to scent your room with lavender and breathe deeply each evening. Another option is to breathe in the aroma from a bottle of lavender for two full minutes at three 10-minute intervals before bedtime.
WEAR A SILK SLEEP MASK
Avoiding light when you sleep is crucial to getting quality rest. An eye mask completely eliminates vulnerability to light, preventing it from interfering with your sleep. For the best results, use a silk eye mask. Since skin is susceptible to wrinkling, make sure that the material pressing against your face is as soft as possible.
For even more of the beauty sleep benefits silk has to offer, we recommend silk pillowcases and bedding. These bedroom essentials can greatly reduce redness and puffiness for beautiful skin after a night’s rest.
KEEP THE TEMPERATURE LOW
At night, your body’s natural temperature declines. Keeping the temperature in your bedroom low is good for both your metabolism and your blood flow. This is important because improving your blood flow helps oxygenate your skin, keeping it plump and even-toned for the day ahead. Maintaining a cool temperature in your bedroom will also help reduce redness in your skin.
EXERCISE REGULARLY
Exercise is another healthy habit that will help you get the ultimate beauty sleep. There is a mountain of research that shows physical exercise improves sleep quality.
Researchers at the University of Massachusetts, for example, note that exercise causes a rise in body temperature followed by a sharp fall in body temperature. This decline in body temperature, “which lasts for two to four hours after exercise, makes it easier to fall asleep and stay asleep.”
A study (found in JAMA Internal Medicine) on individuals with insomnia showed that “regular exercise may be a useful therapeutic modality in the treatment of patients with sleep disorders.” A different study, found in the Sleep Medicine journal, revealed that aerobic exercise of at least 30 to 40 minutes of exercise per day, four days per week, can “improve sleep quality, mood, and quality of life.”
As you can tell, the link between physical activity and sleep is well-established. Decades of research show that getting plenty of exercise is “a healthy, safe, inexpensive, and simple means of improving sleep.”
TRY STRESS REDUCTION TECHNIQUES
Stress and sleep are deeply intertwined. Studies have shown that high levels of stress can disrupt sleep. At the same time, a lack of sleep can cause stress.
The American Psychological Association performed a study that found “43 percent [of American adults] report that stress has caused them to lie awake at night in the past month.”
That’s why reducing stress is essential for you to get the best beauty sleep possible! And, of course, reducing stress levels isn’t just good for your sleep cycle; it’s also great for your health in all sorts of important ways.
Here are some techniques for reducing stress before you hit the hay:Practice simple yoga posesMeditate Try deep breathing exercises (see tip number six)Massage your temples, forehead, and neckClear your mind of negative thoughts
Learn which methods help you to relax, and put them to use before you fall asleep.
GO TO SLEEP AND WAKE UP AT THE SAME TIME EVERY DAY
To get the ultimate beauty sleep you deserve, go to bed and wake up at the same time every single day. This allows your body to develop a natural sleep cycle, sometimes referred to as your body’s circadian rhythm.
To develop a healthy sleep schedule, simply choose an eight-hour block of time for sleep and stick with it. Perhaps the ideal sleep schedule for you is from 11:00 p.m. to 7:00 a.m. Or if your work requires you to rise a bit earlier, perhaps 10:00 p.m. to 6:00 a.m. is best. Whatever times work for you, just remember to be consistent.
We should note here that it’s important to always go to sleep and wake up at the same time. This includes weekends and holidays! It can be tempting to stay up later than normal and sleep in when you have the chance, but this can disrupt your sleep cycle.
In addition, researchers at the University of Massachusetts found that “going to bed early actually makes insomnia worse.” This is true because you may sleep less deeply and wake up earlier than normal, which will lead to feeling fatigued the following day and perhaps needing a nap. To get the most restful beauty sleep possible, go to bed and get up at the same time every day, even if you haven’t slept well or feel super tired.
