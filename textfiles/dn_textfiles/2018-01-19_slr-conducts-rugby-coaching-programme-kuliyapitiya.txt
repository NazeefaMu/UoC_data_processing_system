SLR conducts Rugby Coaching Programme in Kuliyapitiya

Sri Lanka Rugby conducted a Rugby Coaching Programme in the Kuliyapitiya district on the 15th January with over 900 girls and boys participating in the event. It was a resounding success and it was nice to see the Minister of Sports gracing the occasion and encouraging the children.
Sri Lanka Rugby has a big plan to take the sport to the rural areas and they are targeting to take the sport to every educational zone.
Their initial plan is to cover all 25 districts by identifying one Educational Zone in the district. The idea of picking a zone is to create a competition within the zone without having to travel far and also to keep the costs down.
SLR has been conducting training programs for Coaches, Referees, Medics and Match Officials in order to help and support the development programs.
They have a very steep target of increasing the number of players in Sri Lanka to 30,000 within the next three years and this development has been well supported by the Education Ministry and the Sports Ministry.
Sri Lanka rugby are also planning to take the game to the North and the East and hoping to conduct Rugby Coaching Programmes in those provinces within the next two months.
