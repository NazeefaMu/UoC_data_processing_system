Gamini Dissanayake, a political colossus

In my career in Parliament, spanning over thirty years, I have always remembered the late Gamini Dissanayake as one of the most pleasant, charming, charismatic and most importantly erudite leaders this country ever possessed during the last several decades.
Having been educated in Trinity in Kandy, he was one of the Parliamentarians I loved to listen when he made speeches in Parliament both in English and Sinhala. I must also mention there is a vacuum that cannot be filled when Parliament does not include the great men of the calibre of Gamini Dissanayake in our national legislature. It is unfortunate the LTTE eliminated leaders of the type of GD who could have contributed immensely to the economic growth and sustainable development of this country - for the benefit of the people whether they are Sinhalese, Tamils or Muslims.
As I could recall, when JRJ government was elected to power in 1977 with a massive majority of five sixth in Parliament, the then leader entrusted GD one of the most important ministries - Irrigation, Power and Highways, who was in his early thirties. I must sincerely mention that I was fascinated so much to GD as a young staffer in Parliament in early twenties for his simplicity, unassuming nature, oratorical skills, smiling face - which no doubt in speed elevated him to national political groundbreaker - a Statesman in the making.
Mahaweli development project
In fact, I have always been stressing that the Parliament should consist of educated, capable representatives similar to GD. They should possess the ability and the capacity to use the human resources available in plenty as the engine to achieve country's goals for sustainable economic growth and development.
GD was solely responsible to the accelerated Mahaweli development project. His contribution to achieve test status in cricket is again a huge achievement for GD because we became the 8th test playing nation so early thanks to GD. We are now in the frontline in international cricket purely due to the untiring efforts of GD.
If my memory serves me right GD got down cricket legend - Garfield Sobers, to coach Sri Lankan cricketers at the very initial stage. Mr. Sobers was recently here in Sri Lanka. I am happy we have achieved so much in Cricket owing to the untiring efforts of the late GD.
The new politicians and cricket administrators need to learn and follow the footsteps of the late GD. It was indeed a pleasure to see how he ran the Ministry and the Cricket administration. I also recall he got down Dr. Rudi Webster, a well known psychologist, for the purpose of motivating and enhancing the mental abilities of our cricketers.
Sri Lankans should be extremely happy because we have a good number of leaders who have contributed immensely in the field of irrigation from the time of our ancient kings. Former Prime Minister the late D. S. Senanayake constructed Senanayake Sumudra under the Gal Oya Development Scheme, which is one of the largest reservoirs built in early 1960s.
Presidential elections
It was, thereafter, GD who constructed major reservoirs such as Randenigala, Rantambe, Victoria and many other smaller tanks in order to irrigate the dry zone for the benefit of the farmers under the Mahaweli Development Scheme. My father who was a senior Staff Officer in the Gal Oya Development Board (GODB) spoke so well of the ambitious projects undertaken by GD for the development of the country particularly to irrigate the dry zone. His only grouse was that GD took steps to liquidate the GODB, which was renamed River Valleys Development Board (RVDB), after having entrusted all the good work done by RVDB to the newly established Mahaweli Development Board (MDB). Mahaweli Development Board now looks after all the work carried out by the then RVDB, which is therefore now non-existent.
GD was an Advocate by profession having passed the final examination in the Law College in 1960s. I have no doubt GD was a visionary leader and it was so unfortunate that he had been assassinated by the LTTE together with several others when GD contested Presidential elections in 1994.
Gamini no doubt followed his father, the late Andrew Dissanayake, a Deputy Minister subsequently, who was elected to Parliament from Nuwara Eliya under the leadership of the late S.W.R.D. Bandaranaike in 1956.
It was a pity while addressing a Presidential Election rally in Mutwal on October 24, 1994, one of our beloved leaders, the UNP Presidential nominee, was assassinated by a suicide bomber. I wish GD be reborn in Sri Lanka to serve the country even better.
