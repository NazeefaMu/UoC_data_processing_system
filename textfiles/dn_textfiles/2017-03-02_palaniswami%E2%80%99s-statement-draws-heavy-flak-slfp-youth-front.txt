Palaniswami’s statement draws heavy flak from SLFP Youth Front

The Sri Lanka Freedom Party Youth Front (SLFPYF) yesterday condemned Tamil Nadu Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami’s statement that he would support for a separate independent state for Tamils in Sri Lanka, SLFPYF President Shantha Bandara said yesterday.
“We urge him not to interfere in the affairs of other countries, but to uplift the poor people in Tamil Nadu,” Bandara said.
Addressing a media briefing held in Colombo yesterday, he said that new the Chief Minister should at least solve the toilet problem of those people. We condemn his statement which has been made at a time when all communities in Sri Lanka are moving towards reconciliation.
“Both Chief Ministers in Tamil Nadu and the Northern Province are engaged in promoting separatism without solving the problems of the innocent Tamil people. The Northern Chief Minister is also retuning moneys granted by the Treasury without using them for the benefit of the people in the North. Today, the Tamil Diaspora is unable to raise funds with reconciliation efforts underway. This has led them to create unnecessary problem in the country,” the SLFPYF President said.
“We have invited all Joint Opposition (JO) members including it’s patron former President Mahinda Rajapaksa to participate in the SLFP Executive Committee and the SLFP All Island Working Committee under the patronage of President Maithripala Sirisena to be held today. Only those qualified can participate in these Committee meetings and We invite JO members to come and discuss their problems,” he said.
“We remember the damage caused by various factions to the party after the 1977 defeat of SLFP. That is why our President always invites all factions to join with the SLFP and strengthen the party. Even if they are against the national unity government, they can still work towards the strengthening of the party.We also appeal that the youth representation be increased up to 50 percent for the next Local Government election,” he said.
