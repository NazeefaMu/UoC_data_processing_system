High drama all round

She dubs their wedding day on April 4, 2014, as the happiest day of their lives. Three years from the day that they tied the knot this loveable couple has settled down to a comfortable lifestyle. They have had their share of ups and downs but Dananjaya and Shashini Siriwardane have realized today that nothing can keep them apart. Their history together says it all.
The actor
Dananjaya is very professional when it comes to his career. He is so committed to his job. I too was employed at Emirates and was part of the cabin crew and a part time instructor. However Dananjaya’s commitment to his profession really amazes me. He does not take sick leave even when he is ill. He loves his job. I believe that this feature shows in his work. I also think he has the talent to portray diverse roles.
The husband
The transition from boyfriend to husband has changed Dananjaya. He has become a very responsible person. I was surprised to find out how helpful he is around the house when he has some free time. I actually never expected that from him before we got married and it came as a pleasant surprise. He is also very loveable. That is mainly what a woman needs after she gets married. He takes care of me. He tries to give me everything that a man is supposed to give in a marriage. He is still learning but he is managing well.
First meeting
We started off as friends during our school days. I was at Sirimavo Bandaranaike Vidyalaya while Dananjaya was from Ananda College. We met for a photo shoot for a novel which was published in a magazine. Our pictures were carried on the page with each edition. He was my boyfriend in that magazine photo shoot. He was not famous then. He had just started his career.
More than friends
We were very young then. So I had no idea that he was ‘the one’. I think our relationship started out with maybe something like a crush. I can call it love at first sight but when I recall those times I think we were too young to consider it seriously. It was something like puppy love then. However later on through ups and downs we figured out that we should be together. Dananjaya did not ask me to become his girlfriend directly. We knew that our alliance is going towards a relationship.
The proposal
Unlike getting into a relationship, Dananjaya’s proposal was very dramatic. We had a lot of break ups in our relationship in between. We were both young so we did not really know how to patch things up. We have actually had disagreements like a zillion times!
I was in Dubai and Dananjaya came looking for me. We got back together. Then at the Mall of the Emirates he went down on his knees and in front of so many people he proposed to me. I was stunned because never saw it coming. I never expected such a thing from him! I was laughing at first because I thought that he was joking. Then I was embarrassed because so many people have stopped to watch and clap. What was really nice about it was that nobody knew who we were over there. We got engaged in 2013.
Favourite role he has played
Dananjaya did an amazing job in Rathu Ahasa. I think that it was the best he has done so far. He was nominated for Best Actor for his role. We were engaged when he took on the project and I witnessed how much he contributed to that teledrama mentally and physically. That character took a lot out of him. It was a complicated role. It is a person who has a mental disorder but is ordinary in his everyday life. At the end of the production, even though he was the villain, everybody felt pity for him.
We used to discuss his works together from those days onwards and he mentioned that the teledrama is a masterpiece. He was very excited about the script. He had a lot of hopes for the project and he was thankful that he got the role.
Sri Lanka is such a small country and the art industry here is small. Therefore actors do not get much exposure to showcase their talent. He took his character in Rathu Ahasa as an opportunity that was handed over to him to display his acting prowess.
Role best suited for him
I would like to see Dananjaya do a really thuggish role. He has done villainous characters before but not to the extreme level. I would like to see him do a character similar to the one Akshay Kumar played in Rowdy Rathore. I am sure he will do a great job!
Passions
Dananjaya has a passion for writing as well as painting. The writing talent comes from his mother. He is inspired by Mahagama Sekara. He reads his work and gets a lot of influence from them. I have not seen him doing oil paintings but the does abstract pencil drawings well.
Foodwise
Dananjaya is not at all fussy about his food. I know what ways and what kind of food he prefers now. However he does not push me to make them. So I have an easy time cooking for him. I try to make the meals as healthy as possible especially since he is an actor and has to manage his physique well. He has to maintain a proper diet.
I try to mix up the meals. For example if he has something heavy for lunch, then he gets something very light for dinner. We go for steamed food mostly in the night. The morning meal is usually Sri Lankan food. I make milk rice or string hoppers with pol sambol, chicken or fish curry and dahl curry. Those are two of his favourite meals. I love all types of food. There is a big, fat foodie inside me!We go out a lot. If it is only us together we go for a healthy choice. However with friends, we have no choice but to eat whatever food they go for.
Togetherness time
Honestly we don’t get that much of free time. We like to stay at home and watch movies together. He is not a fan of Hindi and Tamil movies but I make him watch them because it will benefit him as an actor. We love films based on real life stories. We always check to see what movies have won accolades and go for them. We watched La La Land together recently. The way I watch movies and the way he watches them are totally different. He was discussing with me about the camera angles and other techniques of the production. The movie was colourful but a little bit boring for us.
We switch off our phones and have some Zen time. We have a place we go to for meditation at Kelaniya temple. We are gym freaks. He goes to the gym more than me. I like to run and engage in contemporary dancing.
Dananjaya is not keen to travel out of Colombo much. I love visiting Nuwara Eliya. We fly to foreign countries whenever we can. We visit Dubai a lot because that is my second home.
Most toughing saying
Dananjaya was recently down with the flu. When I was attending to him he said that I take care of him ‘like a mother’. That was a very touching thing to hear from your husband.
Birthday celebrations
We were in Yala for one of my birthdays which happened in 2015. Dananjaya organized a moonlight dinner for me.
We haven’t really held parties for our birthdays. We prefer to put the money in some cause. We have given money to orphanages and like to spend time with the kids.
Acting offers
I have gotten some acting opportunities before we got married. However Dananjaya did not like me to get into acting. He knew that it was not for me though I was such a drama queen at school. I said ‘no’ because I don’t see any potential to flourish in the industry here. Whenever I see Jacqueline Fernandez on screen I feel so glad that she is not acting in Sri Lanka.
General opinion about artistes’ marriages
I believe that the public’s perception about the marriages of artistes becoming unsuccessful is very wrong. I have friends who do not belong to this field but have been divorced a couple of times. Nobody knows about it because they are not in the spot light. Artistes get the opportunity to reach out to many people and make contact. I was a cabin crew member and people have perceptions over that as well. All of this depends on the person and how they have been brought up.
Future plans
Dananjaya has not directed any production yet but he intends to. His father, Sunil Siriwardena, is a director. Dananjaya has an eye for it. I have watched more movies than him in my life. I have watched The Curious Case of Benjamin Buttons before but the minute I watched it with him is amazing. He has seen the film from a technical angle.
We are also discussing about having our own business. We want to have lots of kids and enjoy a good life.
