Sharjeel, Latif charged for alleged corruption

Pakistan and Islamabad United batsmen Sharjeel Khan and Khalid Latif face the prospect of lengthy bans from cricket after the PCB charged them for alleged breaches of its anti-corruption code.
The pair were handed official charge sheets of their alleged misdemeanours on Saturday in Lahore, a week after they were sent home from the ongoing Pakistan Super League in the UAE.
The PCB confirmed in a statement that Sharjeel and Latif had been charged for breaching various articles under Clause 2, including specific ones to attempt to corrupt a game, as well as more general misdemeanours of failing to disclose suspect approaches.
“They have been handed notices and been advised to seek legal counsel,” the PCB’s legal advisor Taffazul Rizvi said. “They have 14 days to respond.”
Sharjeel and Latif have been in Lahore for the last three days, where they have been interviewed extensively by the PCB’s Vigilance and Security department.
They were handed their notices in person on Saturday.
The other key figure in the investigation is another left-handed opener who has represented Pakistan - Nasir Jamshed, who was arrested in the UK by the National Crime Agency last Monday but released on bail until April.
