Teacher training course duration lessened

The training duration of teacher trainees undergoing courses at 17 national colleges of education countrywide is to be curtailed by six months this year.
Accordingly, 3,500 trainees would finish their courses by December. Their internship training of one year would commence next January 2018.
The Education Ministry has taken this measure to regularize teacher training activities of all National Colleges of Education.
The reduced time would not affect the quality of the training as supplementary and additional academic and practical activities are to be implemented for the teacher trainees, said Commissioner of National Colleges of Education W. H. Bandara.
He added that the decision when it is implemented will enhance the productivity of teacher training activities.
