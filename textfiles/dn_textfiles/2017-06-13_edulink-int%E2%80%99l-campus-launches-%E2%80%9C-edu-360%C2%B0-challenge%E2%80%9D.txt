Better soft skills for better jobs: Speaking of this initiative, The Director of EDULINK International Campus, Kanishka Weeramunda said, “We wanted to take a deep dive into helping eliminate and minimize the soft skills gap that exists among students in terms of being prepared to face the corporate world. Students need to have strong communication and problem-solving skills, leadership and teamwork if they want to succeed in the workplace today.It has been found that whilst many young students today are well qualified, these soft skills are greatly lacking. We believe that competitions of this nature will motivate students to learn these skills and understand their importance. Having these top soft skills on a resume could translate to placement in a much higher level job, resulting in a significantly higher pay for such students.by gaining these high-level skills.”
The event will be held on June 24 commencing from 9am at the Colombo Racecourse Grounds. Interested students can register by visiting www.edu360.edulink.edu.lk
