Administration of Matara DCA may change today

It is expected that the administration of the Matara District Cricket Association (MDCA) may change at their Annual General Meeting scheduled at the Sri Lanka Cricket Auditorium at 10am today.
State Minister for Finance and Member of Parliament for the Matara District is tipped to be elected as the President of the MDCA while Dr Sanjaya Sedara Senarath who has held the post for two terms will step
down.
It is learnt that Sunil Mohotti presently a member of SLC’s executive committee who has held the post of secretary of the MDCA for over two decades will not stand for election while a group of former cricketers
led by SLC’s former district coach Prasanna Galappaththi who opposed the present administration hopes to contest for the key positions.
There has been no spectacular development in the standard of cricket in the Matara District in the past few years due to the tight stringent policies of the District Cricket Association except for conducting the Matara Super League T20 held last year.
MDCA’s plans to maintain the Uyanwatta Stadium as an exclusive cricket venue did not materialize due to public outcry.
It is hoped that the first priority of whoever is elected to office at today’s AGM will be to better the standard of the game in the District.
