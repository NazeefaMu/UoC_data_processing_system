T20 match between Sri Lanka – West Indies rescheduled

The T20 match between Sri Lanka and West Indies which was scheduled to be held on 12 November 2015 has been rescheduled to be held on 11 November (Wednesday) at the R. Premadasa Stadium, after discussions with the relevant Cricket Boards, the Sports Ministry stated.
The T20 was rescheduled as 12 November was declared a national day or mourning by the government, due to the demise of Ven. Maduluwawe Sobhitha Thera. 
Further, the Ministry stated that a minute of silence will be observed prior to the match and the Sri Lankan cricketer will wear a yellow band on their hands as a gesture of respect.
