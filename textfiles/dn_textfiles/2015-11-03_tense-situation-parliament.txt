Tense situation in Parliament

A tense situation erupted in Parliament yesterday as opposition MPs protested inside the Chamber with placards against the Police attack on HNDA students who were protesting near the UGC last Thursday.
MEP Leader Dinesh Gunawardena rising to a Point of Order demanded to know why the Parliament road had been blocked by the deployment of Police and Army personnel without allowing the protesting students to come to Parliament to present their grievances.
"Former Speaker Chamal Rajapaksa did away with all barricades for people to visit Parliament because it is the right of the general public to come here. On the contrary, about 500 Police and military personnel have been deployed near Parliament today. We want to know why the Speaker has called to deploy the Army to prevent these student leaders from coming to Parliament to meet us and present their grievances. This is totally undemocratic," MP Gunawardena said. At this point, about 25 Opposition MPs rose from their seats in protest displaying placards which read "Let's condemn Yahapalana police's attack on students," and "Ranil's Police state is sucking the blood of students". The placards carried the line "Joint Opposition" at the bottom.
The MPs who protested holding placards included Dinesh Gunawardena, Bandula Gunawardena, Wimal Weerawansa, Mahindananda Aluthgamage, Kumara Welgama, Dullas Alahapperuma, Weerakumara Dissanayake, Niroshan Premaratne, Udaya Gammanpila, Vasudeva Nanayakkara, Gamini Lokuge, Jayantha Samaraweera, Rohitha Abegunawardena, Lohan Ratwatte, Roshan Ranasinghe, Namal Rajapaksa, Prasanna Ranaweera, Prasanna Ranatunga, SM Chandrasena, Sisira jayakody, Keheliya Rambukwella and CB Ratnayake.
