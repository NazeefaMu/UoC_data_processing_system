Taking stock post disaster

The government has acted prudently in cancelling all luxury vehicle imports for ministers, secretaries and government officials for the current year in the wake of the flood disaster. Parliamentarians have also decided to donate one month’s salary towards relief assistance which though a pittance, given the magnitude of the disaster, is none the less a welcome gesture.
Speaking at an emergency Cabinet session on Tuesday the President opined that top priority should be given at this stage to assist the stricken flood victims to the exclusion of all other matters. It has to be conceded that the import of luxury vehicles for use by ministers had been a sticking sore point with the public all along and such extravagance at a time of natural disasters resulting in a large scale loss of life and destruction to property, needless to say, can only exacerbate the ill feelings. Hence the government's energies should be fully focused in proving succour to the affected victims at this moment of calamity.
The President has also instructed that all officials circulars and red tape be dispensed with in providing relief to the victims while Deputy Minister Eran Wickramaratne announced that no official will be taken to task for acting out of the box in delivering emergency relief to the victims. Hence it is inexplicable why the personages of the Joint Opposition keep harping on the matter when the Head of State, no less, has given this assurance to the officials unless of course the JO has seized on the natural disaster to fish in troubled waters. JO stalwarts Udaya Gammanpila and Bandula Gunawardena who disappeared from the public eye in the midst of the disaster have suddenly emerged out of the woodworks to proffer gratuitous advise to the government on how to deal with the situation. What is more, former President Mahinda Rajapaksa has taken upon himself the task of instructing officials to ignore government circulars in getting about their business, perhaps still entertaining delusions of grandeur while Wimal Weerawansa, true to form, has placed the blame for the floods and landslides squarely at the doorstep of the government. This frivolity at a time of a natural disaster of the worst kind where one in 40 Sri Lankans have been affected.
It is time that all parties shelve their differences and act in concert to assist the unfortunate victims who are crying out for help. In this respect the GMOA has to be commended for coming to the assistance of the government with which it had been at loggerheads over the SAITM issue. A similar response is expected from others too who wield influence. Politics should not be brought to the fore at a time of national calamity. All should join forces in empathy with the stricken victims. It was this spirit that prevailed during the Tsunami catastrophe when, then Opposition leader Ranil Wickremesinghe joined CBK in a vigil ceremony at the Vihara Maha Devi Park on behalf of those who perished. Though not on the scale of the Tsunami the current disaster has wrought massive destruction to life and property and warrants equal attention by all.
The government has offered compensation on behalf of the dead and the damage to homes and businesses. A sum of Rs. 2.5 million will be granted for each damaged home while Rs. 2 billion will be given for businesses destroyed, by way of a soft loan. However restoring homes alone would not suffice. The government will have to assist the victims in rebuilding their lives. It is not just their homes which had got washed away in the deluge but also lifelong possessions, their livelihoods and much more. To begin with, the government will have to directly involve itself in the whole process of restoring the lives of these unfortunates given the trauma they had undergone. The issue of schooling of the children displaced must also seriously engage the attention of the authorities lest social problems emerge when the flood waters recede.
Be that as it may, contingency plans should at least now be put in place to mitigate flood disasters. Deputy Minister Eran Wickramaratne wants prevailing laws amended to draw up such contingency plans for the future. He has also called for a geological survey to be carried out to study the soil types in the landslide prone areas to explore the possibility of a solution. Of course work towards the flood control task would entail monumental funds which the country can ill afford at present. What is needed therefore are measures to mitigate the damage during floods and earth slips. Tough and unpopular measures will have to be taken and the public educated in this regard. While nature’s fury could not be fought by man there are things that could be done to minimize death and destruction such as clearing people from landslide prone areas and the eviction of squatters on river banks. A political will too will be needed to implement these measures.
