Navy opens five Reverse Osmosis plants

The Research and Development Unit of the Navy helped install five more Reverse Osmosis (RO) plants in different parts of the country where communities struggle to find drinking water.
This is an initiative to fight the rapid spread of kidney diseases in the area.
In line with these objectives, the Navy opened five more RO plants manufactured by the Navy’s Research and Development Unit for community use at Damanayaya in Dambulla, Kudagama, Halmillewa and Mayingamuwa in Anuradhapura, Thabbowa in Puttalam, Thissapura in Medirigiriya.
Accordingly, around 1,200 families in Damanayaya, 620 families in Kudagama, 550 families in Halmillewa, 520 families in Mayingamuwa, 520 families in Thabbowa, and 570 families in Thissapura will be benefited.
The Navy, on par with the far-sighted leadership of Navy Commander Vice Admiral Ravindra Wijegunaratne, has been installing RO plants in various parts of the country where kidney diseases are rampant due to the lack of water resources to meet drinking water needs of the community within the region.
Thus far, the Navy has installed 190 Reverse Osmosis plants in different parts of the country to date, facilitating 90,046 families and 70,200 schoolchildren with drinking water.
