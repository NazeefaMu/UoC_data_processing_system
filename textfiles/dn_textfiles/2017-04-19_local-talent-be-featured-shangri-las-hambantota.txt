Local talent to be featured at Shangri-la's Hambantota

Mueen Saheed, a contemporary abstract artist from Colombo, had his recent works on display at a special viewing held at Shangri-La's Resort and Spa in Hambantota on April 5th.
The artist showcased over twenty two warm-hued canvases-most of them figurative in nature.
The inaugural commemorative prints conveyed the aura of the surrounding landscape and wildlife in Hambantota. The artist claimed that his works were meant to be viewed as narratives. "This is a special event and I am grateful to Shangri-La's Hambantota Resort and Spa for this opportunity. What you see today reflects an abstract medium of art which is non-verbal and expresses only emotion. Feelings like laughter, fragrance, beauty, deep contemplation, moods, thoughts, heartbeats and my inner soul," Saheed said.
The artist's work will be on display at the resort in the lobby, the Bojunhala restaurant and in a select number of premium rooms.
"We are so glad to showcase the talented work of a Sri Lankan artist at Shangri-La's Hambantota Resort and Spa. Mueen is dedicated to his craft and has truly captured the spirit of Hambantota in these paintings. We are confident that our guests will derive as much pleasure from viewing these special pieces as Mueen did creating them," said Iain McCormack
