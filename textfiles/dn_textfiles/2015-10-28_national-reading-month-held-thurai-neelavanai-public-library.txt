National Reading Month held at Thurai Neelavanai Public Library

The National Reading Month was observed at the Thurai Neelavanai Public Library recently, organised by Librarian Hareesa Sameem. Valuable Tamil, English, Sinhala and Arabic books, cartoons, drawings, and artifacts were on display at the exhibition. Abacus and books of ancient days, were also on view at the exhibition.
Through library exhibitions, students are able to enrich their knowledge.
As reading habits of pupils are poor, this type of exhibition would really induce students to promote their reading habits and this would be the best opportunity to enrich their knowledge in all aspects by making use of the library, Librarian Hareesa Sameem said.
She said as the National Reading Month has had an impact on the students, this type of exhibition should be organized every year, while the use of the library too had considerably increased.
Students from various schools, parents and well-wishers thronged the streets of Thurai Neelavanai to view the exhibition.
Notary Public S. Sundaralingam, retired Principal S. Mylvaganam, Thurai Neelavanai Sithy Vinayagar Vidyalaya Principal A. Manokaran, In- Service Advisor S. Thillainathan, teachers and library staff participated on the occasion.
