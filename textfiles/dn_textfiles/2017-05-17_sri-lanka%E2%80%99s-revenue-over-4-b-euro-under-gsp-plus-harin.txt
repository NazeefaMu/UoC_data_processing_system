Sri Lanka’s revenue to up over 4 b Euro under GSP Plus: Harin

Sri Lanka will receive a revenue of over 4 billion Euro under the GSP Plus concession, Telecommunication and Digital Infrastructure Minister Harin Fernando said.
He made this remark while addressing the media at Sirikotha yesterday.
Fernando said Sri Lanka will receive immense benefits under the GSP Plus concession as the country will obtain a huge market potential. He said as a result of the notorious behaviour of the Rajapaksa regime, the country lost the GSP Plus concession.
“As an outcome of losing the GSP Plus concession, the country suffered a lot including the closing down of factories and cutting down employments,” he said.
According to statistics, more than 40 garment factories were closed. The financial loss was estimated to over Rs 1,500 million, he said.
He said the government does not care what the Joint Opposition says and does.
Fernando said the media suppression, assault on media personnel, failing to carry out law and order, unnecessary involvement in the judiciary and poor implementation of human rights resulted in the loss the GSP Plus.
