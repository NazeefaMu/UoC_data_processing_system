I resigned from the SEC as I did not condone illegal activities:MP Prof. Ashu Marasinghe
UNP MP Prof. Ashu Marasinghe yesterday, said in Parliament that he was forced to resign from the post of Chairman of the State Engineering Corporation (SEC), because he did not condone illegal activities.
The MP made this comment as a reply to the statements by the Joint Opposition, demanding his arrest in connection with the charges against former Minister Wimal Weerawansa over the misuse of SEC vehicles.
The MP taking part in the debate yesterday, said he at no point approved or encouraged sending SEC vehicles for the use of the then Construction, Engineering Services, Housing and Common Amenities Minister Weerawansa or his relatives and close associates.
“I did not do such foolish things. I told the then Minister that such acts could lead to imprisonment. That was the reason I resigned from the post. I took office in May 2010 and gave my resignation letter on May 25, 2011. I resigned on . The acting Deputy General Manager (DGM) who is now under probe, was appointed after I left. I gave a statement to the Police in connection to this charge and it was given in the B report too,” he explained.
The MP further revealed that the project to install toll gates at the Southern Expressway was received by the SEC after a competitive bidding process in 2011, but the project had to be given up due to political pressure.
“The SEC had made the lowest bid of Rs 1,000 million. However, soon after we secured it, I got a phone call from former President Mahinda Rajapaksa, asking me to give it up stating the SEC was not capable enough to handle it. Both former President Rajapaksa and former Minister Weerawansa wanted me to resign, but I resisted. Later, I resigned and after that they tried to arrest me. Muhammad Muzammil, who was a working director of the SEC at that time, came to my house and took all the files that were in my possession, threatening me of arrest,” he said.
He also called on COPE Chairman Sunil Handunnetti to hold a special inquiry on the project to install toll gates at the Expressway. “After I left, the SEC was removed from the project and given to the private sector. Probe as to why this project was diverted to another party allowing the SEC to collapse,” he said.
“I ask Weerawansa and those in his party to avoid throwing stones at others, while living in glass houses. The truth would prevail,” he added.
‘SPMC medicine production will not be handed over to India’
The government has no any intention of handing over medicine production of the State Pharmaceutical Manufacturing Corporation (SPMC) to India, but to expand its production, said Health, Nutrition and Indigenous Medicine Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne.
He made this observation yesterday in Parliament, in response to an allegation made by JVP Parliamentarian Nalinda Jayathissa that the government was taking measures to hand over a section of the medicine production of the SPMC to India.
“It is not what is happening there,” Minister Senaratne said. “The government is attempting to expand the factory. According to plans, when the expansion is made, a section of the SPMC has to be closed down temporarily.”
He said the SPMC without terminating the production, a factory would be rented out in India and production would be continued with Sri Lankan staff.
“Once the construction is over, everything would be brought back to the country,” the Minister said. “We sought opportunities to hire one in Sri Lanka, but the issue was, when it is done in Sri Lanka, the factory owner could commence the production with SPMC technology immediate after the factory was handed over to them. It would affect SPMC’s business. That was the reason for us to hire one from India.”
The Minister also asked MP Nalinda Jayathissa to inquire into the stance taken by the Sri Lankan Medical Council on the proposal of the SAITM to hand over the Nevil Fernando Hospital with 1,000 beds in order to enable SAITM students to receive clinical training. He made this demand when Nalinda Jayathissa said the ministers were attempting to grant permission for the SAITM although it was illegal.
The Minister said that he had not have any dialogue with the SLMC, but there were three concerns over SAITM. “They were the lack of Public health, Forensic medicine and Clinical training,” the Minister said. “Following a Court order, the Kaduwela MOH and Avissawella hospital have been directed for the students to receive Public health and Forensic medicine exposure. SAITM has also proposed to hand over the Neville Fernando Hospital to the government”
