PHI develops dengue mosquito detection instrument

Chirantha Guruge, a Public Health Inspector (PHI) attached to the Galle Municipal Council has produced an instrument which helps to detect the dengue mosquito, Aedes aegypti.
Guruge says his instrument helps to detect the dengue mosquito found in gutters, concrete slabs toilet pits and higher elevations in homes and buildings easily.
Introducing his novel creation at the Galle Municipal Council premises yesterday, Guruge said he used a vehicle reversing camera battery, monitor, aluminium pipe and a battery charger to turn out his instrument. The production cost was around Rs 10,000. It can be used to detect mosquitoes at a height of about 20 feet.
However the instrument had no recording facility. He could further develop with novel features if some person or institution came forward to assist him. He said the instrument has easy mobility as it could be hung on the shoulder. Galle Municipal Commissioner Ranil Wickremasekara and the MoH and several other PHIs were present on the occasion.
