Responsible investments drive sustainable success stories

On March 5, Tundra Fonder - in cooperation with the Colombo Stock Exchange – hosted the CSE Tundra Sustainability Forum in Colombo.
You might ask why an asset manager from the North would travel across the world to arrange an event on responsible investments in Sri Lanka? This article, the first in a series on responsible investing, corporate social responsibility (CSR) and international sustainability trends, hopefully will answer this question.
We will gather our thoughts on environment, social aspects and governance (ESG) in business and highlight requirements from institutional investors. There is an urgent need for action and we want to share our experiences in order for Sri Lankan companies to plan for the long game.
Tundra Fonder is an asset manager that focuses on listed equities in what is refered to as “The next generation of Emerging Markets”. Today we manage USD 600 mn in listed equities across our core markets: Vietnam, Pakistan, Nigeria, Bangladesh, Kenya, Egypt and Sri Lanka.
These markets are selected for being key potential growth markets in the decades to come. In the wake of globalisation, new markets are expected to repeat the growth from earlier success stories such as China and South Korea.
Initiatives like the “One Belt, One Road” will transform the next generation of emerging markets, creating the means to achieve high and sustained growth for the next 20 years.
“We currently hold an equity portfolio of USD 25m in Sri Lanka, which we expect to grow significantlyin theyears to come.
Sri Lanka is included in our core markets, despite being significantly smaller in terms of population as compared to the other countries in the portfolio.”
“ When we refer to Sri Lanka we often describe it as “the next Singapore”, meaning that Sri Lanka, in our view, has the potential to become an important trade and services hub. Its strategic location next to India and the potential availability for developing significant deep-sea ports are tremendous advantages; a young and literate population is another.”
Sri Lanka’s services sector has performed extremely well, IT services and tourism, in particular, deserves a special mention. Tourism revenue is already 4% of GDP and the prospects for future growth appear very strong. Today Sri Lanka welcomes about 2.2 mn tourists per year.
Mauritius, in comparison, welcomes 1.3m tourists to an area corresponding to only 1/30th of Sri Lanka’s size. With its well-developed leisure sector, coupled with continued improvements to infrastructure, Sri Lanka has the potential to see revenue from tourism grow at a double-digit growth rate for the next decade.
If handled well, tourism and associated services can enable Sri Lanka to avoid youth unemployment, and balance the eventual decline in remittances and increases in the import of raw materials.
The development of Sri Lanka and Tundra’s other core markets will not go unnoticed from foreign institutional investors who will gain increased interest for this new generation of promising markets.
Significant foreign portfolio inflows constitute a major possibility, something that can further strengthen the growth case.
Parallel to these likely success factors, global trends show an increased awareness among investors on the unsustainable path adopted by developed countries to achieve wealth during the past century. Aspects of ESG, Sustainability, Responsible Investments, CSR and a vast body of related terminology are rapidly becoming a top priority to investors. It all comes down to the same core features on how to adopt more responsible ways of conducting business.
New standards and demands for sustainable business models are unfolding. According to the Global Sustainable Investment Alliance (GSIA) socially responsible investments made up 26% of all financial investments in the world by end of 2016, growing at twice the pace of conventional investments during years 2012-2016. In our view this trend is accelerating, especially among younger investors and women. Going forward, successfully attracting foreign institutional investments will require demonstrating the existence of a robust ESG framework from companies.
There are several examples of initiatives that can provide solid guidelines and frameworks in support of a global ambition to reach sustainable, long-term growth. At Tundra we have chosen to support and align our work with global initiatives that encourage organisations to integrate ESG factors into their investment processes and strategies.
These include the UN Global Compact (UNGC), a UN initiative that encourages SMEs, large corporations and entire cities to adopt socially responsible policies under ten principles in four broad categories: human rights, labour, environment and anti-corruption.
Tundra is an active participant to the UN Global Compact and a member of the recently launched UNGC Network Sweden. With participating companies in over 160 countries, the UN Global Compact is the world’s largest corporate sustainability initiative.
At the United Nations Sustainable Development Summit, more than 150 world leaders adopted the new 2030 Agenda including the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) aiming to end poverty, protect the planet and ensure prosperity for all. We consider the work on the SDGs a fundamental pillar in the efforts for any business. This will be described more in detail in a later article.
Tundra also stands as a signatory to the PRI (Principles for Responsible Investment), an independent body that promotes responsible investments through its six principles, supported by the United Nations.
“Developed by investors for investors”, the aim of the PRI is to develop a more sustainable global financial system and encourage the incorporation of ESG concerns into everyday investment practices. The PRI has over 1,800 signatories across 50 countries.
“We also encourage companies, especially larger organisations to report through the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI). GRI - an independent international organisation providing a platform for businesses and governments worldwide to communicate their impact on critical sustainability issues such as climate change, human rights, governance and social well-being - celebrated 20 years last year and can be described as one of the pioneers in sustainability reporting.”
“We recommend all businesses to join and disclose through at least one international initiative for increased transparency and engagement”.
To us, responsible investing is an important part of our day-to-day business.
We believe that incorporating ESG into the core of the organisation will improve the long-term performance and increase foreign investor interest for companies in emerging and frontier markets.
With an increased understanding of the accelerating requirements and a sincere commitment to sustainable growth, we believe that Sri Lanka has a unique opportunity to write a new chapter in the Asian success story.
