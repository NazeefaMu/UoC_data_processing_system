Her speed was a lightning Rod

In the 1970s she was the QUEEN of the track in the country’s athletic world. Wherever or whenever she got under starters orders or on the blocks as it were, she would burn the track with her lightning like speed that left her opponents dumbfounded.
She was the cynosure of all eyes and she seldom let herself or her supporters down, winning her events with consummate ease, setting up records and then automatically earning national representation.
We refer to KAHANDA GAMAGE BADRA one of the finest and eye catching athlete produced by the country who we are proud to include in our Hall of Fame of ‘SPORTS LEGENDS’ today.
Prowess in running
It was on the old Sugathadasa Stadium track that she put on show her prowess in the running game. Being on the track also saw her falling in love and it was not long when the brilliant runner said ‘I DO’ to another speed gun on the track SUNIL GONEWARDENE and are still loving partners in the all important lives track.
First to BADRA who was the youngest in a family of five born to K.G.Francis Appuhamy and Cicilian Munasinghe on January 17 in Madawalamulla, Galle. Her father was a leading businessman in Galle. BADRA had her earlier education at Sangamitta Balika MV in Galle and
later switched to Buddhist Ladies Colombo. As a student she loved to do Science. But it was as an athlete was in what she shone in and being a champion in school and District level and then where ever she faced the starter’s orders that she began her career on the track that finally culminated in her being crowned the QUEEN of the track.
Bundle of energy
With her career blossoming she was a bundle of energy as she took to the track at every meet setting up records that took the local athletic world by storm. Her talent improved beyond recognition after she joined Holy Family Convent thanks to that great games mistress Trixie Jayasuriya. Many were the anecdotes on Txirie Jayasuriya that Marianne Decker who was Sports Sub Editor on the ’Daily News’ and a past Familian and a good raconteur would relate to me to break the monotony on the Desk and ease tension and together we would enjoy a laugh. I knew Trixie Jayasuriya well because I used to cover netball for the ‘TIMES’ and at times relate these
stories told by Marianne to her. She would retort by saying ‘You mean that Marianne ‘Double’ Decker? And would smile.
Trixie Jayasuriya who had the knack of spotting talent and turning them into champions was a dedicated and disciplined coach in all sports in the convent and many were the champions she turned out in athletics and netball. That was the golden era when there were many outstanding games mistresses in Kusuma George, Nancy de Siva, Cynthia Rasquingho and the pretty Nessi Nalliah.
The famous ‘Pubs’
In an earlier era when the famous Public Schools Athletic Championships was eagerly awaited and the cynosure of all eyes there were talented athletes who drew interest and attracted crowds in their numbers to the Oval where the meet was held. Women athletes of that era who come to mind are Rukmani Vethanayagam, Shrahi Bongso, Jilska Flamer Caldera and the Van Heers. The men were Sarath Wijesinghe, Nagalingam Ethiriveerasingham, Winslow, Adolph Silva, Vijitha
Wijesekera, T.D.S.A. Dissanayake and Ranjit Weerasena.
The Tarbat trophy awarded at that meet belonged every year to the Josephians who dominated the track and Field events shown the way by that unforgettable coach Anthony Abeysinghe.
Champion at school
Back to BADRA and she was a champion at school, District and All Island level. She was a flyer always off to a dream start along with the starter’s gun. She was the QUEEN in the 100m, 200m and 400m.
In 1969 she was All Island Champion and qualified to represent the country at the Thailand International meet in all three events. It was her father who sponsored her to Thailand where she got the first taste of what international competition is all about.
BADRA’S immense talent earned her reward when she was selected for a three month training course at the Munich Sports University in 1979. This training further helped improve her running which saw her as an automatic selection for the Asian Games and Commonwealth Games.
Once in a lifetime
BADRA treasures most the once in a lifetime opportunity she got to dine with another Queen - QUEEN ELIZABETH at Queen’s Palace in Scotland after the Commonwealth Games because she was the only competitor from the country. BADRA remained unassuming with records under her belt in the 100m with 11.9 secs running in a meet at the Munich University in Germany in 1970. At the Asian Games in 1971 she had good timings of 24.9 secs in the 200 metres
and she had another impressive timing of 56.8 secs in the 400 metres. What was great was that these records remained untouched for 20 years. AMAZING. With no other female athlete to challenge or break her records, she quit the track that she dominated with dash and daring and saying enough is enough she left open the track for up and coming young other athletes to
show their skill and if possible emulate her deeds that would remain ever printed for posterity in the record books.
Sports officer
BADRA was first invited to join the Ceylon Transport Board by her husband to be SUNIL GUNEWARDANE another gazelle on the track. But had to turn down that offer as she preferred to join the Sports Ministry as Sports Officer where she was confident that she could train and impart her knowledge to the budding athletes getting on the track.
It was not long before her hard work was recognized and it was not long when she was made Project Officer and capping it all by ending up as Assistant Director. Her hard work in spending her time showing the young athletes how was amply rewarded when she was awarded a one year Sports Diploma in the Minz Sports University in Germany in 1986.
She was also selected for a six month training course at the Munich Sports University in Germany in 1971.The writer visited this University when being the guest of the West German Government for the 1972 Olympic Games and can vouch for the wonderful training facilities that this University offers.
Part to perfection
Having played her part to perfection producing many national champions this dashing QUEEN and tagged the GALLE EXPRESS hung up her spikes leaving the track that she dominated open for other athletes to follow and if possible erase her phenomenal records. BADRA still sports that winsome smile. She is married to SUNIL GUNEWARDANE.
