Olympic champ Merritt reveals second kidney op

 
SHANGHAI, FRIDAY: Olympic hurdles champion Aries Merritt revealed on Friday that he needed a second operation for kidney trouble and said he was “months” behind in his preparations for the Rio Games.
The 30-year-old American underwent a kidney transplant in September but he said he then needed a second procedure after complications developed.
The latest details about Merritt's condition raise questions about his ability to mount a successful Olympic title defence. He said he still suffers discomfort when he trains and competes.
“About seven weeks later, I actually had a second surgery that many people don't know about,” Merritt told journalists ahead of the Shanghai Diamond League.
“I had one complication which caused me to have to go back in and have another operation... I was having difficulty with haematoma that had developed that was actually crushing the kidney.”
Merritt was back training in by January but he said his preparations were way behind those of his rivals. He finished sixth in the 110 metres hurdles at this month's Doha Diamond League.
“It is a struggle, but it's not because over time it will get better and better. But I don't want to make any excuses because I'm lining up with everyone else,” Merritt said.
