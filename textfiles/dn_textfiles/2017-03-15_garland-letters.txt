Garland of letters

“Sage Valluvar Priest of thy lowly clan, No tongue repeats, No speech reveals thy Name
Yet,all things changing dieth not thy fame, For thou art band of Universal man.”
This tribute by the Rev. Dr.G.U.Pope D.D one of the best known English born Tamil scholars, was written more than a hundred years ago. Valluvar, is more popularly known as Thiruvalluvar. But very little is known about him. His immortal work the Kural-more popularly called the Thirukkural does not reveal anything about the author or when it was written. The date of the work is uncertain. But it is believed it was written in the 1st century A.D.
Valluvar was not his name but it was the name of the priest of the lowly castle. The kural is not the name of the book. Kural in Tamil means a short poem composed in a very difficult meter. Thiru means holy. No other work has been written by Valluvar.
The Kural is a master piece and an exquisite composition and has survived unchanged for nearly 2000 years. The work itself is in three parts and contain 133 chapters. Each chapter has ten two line verses. Together making 1330 verses. The first part deals with virtue and apart from an introduction it deals with domestic virtue.
The 1st part opens with the words “A leads letters, ancient Lord, leads and lords the ensure world.”
The Thirukkural is not a religious work but essentially an ethical work. It seeks to teach mankind how to lead a good life. The second part is entitled wealth and deals with royalty, state, cabinet, politics, alliance and other miscellaneous matters. The third part is entitled Love, and deals with secret marriage life.
It is not possible to reproduce in a short article some of the poet’s exquisite verses, but a selection is reproduced below but it is neither comprehensive nor is it a judicious selection.
So little is known about Thiruvalluvar’s life and work that legends have grown that legends have grown around him. Not all of them are acceptable. Valluvar was married to Vasuki. It was a happy marriage. Vasuki obeyed her husband, and fulfilled his slightest wish.
It is told that a venerable person came to Valluvar’s house and asked which is better. “A married life or the life of a lonely hermit.” The sage made no reply, but invited the visitor to stay with him. The visitor during his stay, was able to see for himself how Vasuki looked after the house and her husband.
The visitor concluded. “If such a wife can be had it is wise to marry; if not the monastic state is better.” So without the sage answering the visitor’s question the visitor had been enlightened.
Thiruvalluvar was a weaver by profession and he bought his thread from a merchant Elelasingan, who became a faithful disciple of Valluvar. It is claimed that this Elelasingan was the 6th generation descendent of the one the famed Tamil Kings.
