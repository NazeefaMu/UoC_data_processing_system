Rajanganaya reservoir issue
Drinking water project under NWSDB, says GM

The drinking water supply project utilising water from the Rajanganaya reservoir is a government development project supervised by the National Water Supply and Drainage Board (NWSDB), the NWSDB General Manager Eng. D.U. Sumanasekara, issuing a special statement, said.
Sumanasekara said that the project is not a privately owned water-bottling project. After the completion of the project, it will be maintained and controlled by the National Water Supply and Drainage Board, he further stated. The NWSDB observed that it needs to come to a common understanding with local farmers’ associations on utilizing the waters of the Rajanganaya reservoir, despite the fact that the Irrigation Department agreed to allocate 44,000 cubic metres for this project in 2015.
The NWSDB pointed out that it is possible to limit the water supply for the concerned water project in the drought season and give priority to the water supply allocated for the farmers in the area. The current Thambuththegama Water Supply Project which was implemented under the Mahaweli Project provides drinking water for around 4,750 families from the Nallachchi reservoir. The proposed plan attempts to acquire water from the Rajanganaya reservoir to extend to the Thambuththegama Water Supply Project.
The Thambuththegama project requires 19,800 cubic metres per day. The new project will provide water for 28 grama niladhari divisions in Thambuththegama, four in Galnewa Divisional Secretariat and 12 in Talawa Divisional Secretariat.
The proposed project is funded with a loan of Rs. 17,000 million from China Development Bank.The water project was suspended by the National Water Supply and Drainage Board, adhering to the instructions given by Anuradhapura Government Agent R.M. Wanninayake, consequent to the protest by Rajanganaya farmers opposing the intake of water for the project from the Rajanganaya reservoir.
The Anuradhapura District Coordination Committee Meeting is to sit tomorrow, under the headship of President Maithripala Sirisena, to reach a final decision on the matter.
