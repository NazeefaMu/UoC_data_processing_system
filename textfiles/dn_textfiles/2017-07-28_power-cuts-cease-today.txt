Power cuts to cease today

The disruption of power will be halted by today, (July 28), CEB Spokesperson Sulakshana Jayawardena said.
He said that the supply of power was disrupted intermittently island wide in order to balance the national grid.
The Spokesperson said that the island wide power cuts were unscheduled.
Jayawardena stated that the third unit of the Norchcholai power plant which has a capacity of 300MW is no longer functioning which has contributed to the need for the disruption of the supply of power.
He also said that capacity of the Kelanitissa power plant had been reduced by 110 MW while Pallekale and Galle hydro power plants do not have sufficient oil to run them.
