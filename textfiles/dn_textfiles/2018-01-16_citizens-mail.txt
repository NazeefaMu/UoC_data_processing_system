Citizen's Mail

Unwarranted respect
Some politicians are in the habit of naming various buildings, projects and schools in their names. These buildings, projects and schools built using the government funds. We are immensely thankful that the incumbent political leaders have not stooped down to such lower positions.
When naming the buildings after themselves, what the politicians shall not forget is that they are dishing out the taxpayers’ money. The designs are by engineers. The construction is done by the workers. Sometimes a number of workers ranging from professional engineers to labourers have died in accidents in the course of performing their duties.
But at the opening ceremonies and at anniversaries the politicians forget all this and they put their names for the projects. Only the politicians sometimes are invited for the opening ceremonies. They forget to mention the names of workers who sacrificed their lives for the betterment of the nation.
It is alright to name a building using a name of a politician, if the politician paid for the construction of the building. If the building is built using government funds it is not correct to name it after a politician.
We hope the politicians will not claim unnecessary respect and credit in the future.
