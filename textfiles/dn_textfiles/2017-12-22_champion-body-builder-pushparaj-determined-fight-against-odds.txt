Champion body builder Pushparaj determined to fight against the odds

Professional body builder Lucion Pushparaj, better known as the Black Lion of Asia said at a press conference that his chances of representing Sri Lanka in the future is inevitable because his identity reflects his nationality as being a Lankan citizen.
Pushparaj made this statement at a press conference where he said that the Sri Lanka Body Building Federation has not officially imposed any official ban against him till this day.
When asked his opinion regarding a statement made by the Minister of Sports, Dayasiri Jayasekara to let him participate in this said international bodybuilding event because he was not representing Sri Lanka, thus disagreeing to this matter Lucion also stated that
“If there’s no official ban on the sport against me I have all the right to represent my country under the national flag,” said Pushparaj.
Explaining further he said that he even met Sports Minister Dayasiri Jayasekera in person before embarking to Texas America to take part in the Mr & Ms Atlas and Fitness Expo 2017 and the Minister had congratulated him.
Pushparaj won the fourth place in the contest which was held at the Arlington Convention Center in Texas, America on December 9.
He announced that he hoped to take part in five upcoming tournaments for 2018 despite the Federation’s attempts to prevent him from representing his country.
“I have dealt with the problems created by the Federation and faced them bravely. That has stood me in good stead when taking part at international competitions to win medals and bring honour to my country,” said Pushparaj, a professionally acclaimed bodybuilder who was awarded IFBB (International Federation of Bodybuilding & Fitness) Pro status in 2012.
Pushparaj won his first major competition with a gold medal in the 2014 Mr. Sri Lanka contest. The same year he also won a gold medal in the IFBB Pro Championship held in Oman, and later a silver medal in the IFBB Asian Championship.
Pushparaj proved his prowess in the 2017 Asian Body Building Championship held in South Korea this year which marked the turning point of his career.
