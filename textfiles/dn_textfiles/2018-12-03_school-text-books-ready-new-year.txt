School text books ready for new year

The Education Ministry will print all the required school text books for next year, Education Ministry sources said.
It has been estimated that 39. 4 million text books are required for 2019.
Of that volume 87 per cent of books have already been printed and distributed to regional centres to be distributed among students.
The balance 13 per cent will also be dispatched for distribution by the end of December, he added.
There is no truth in the news circulating that the printed text books are not distributed among students as there is a picture of the former Education Minister in text books.
Even though there is a picture of the former Minister in text books, those books are distributed as usual, the sources said.
