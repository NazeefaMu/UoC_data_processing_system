Junior Davis Cup Asia Oceania Pre-qualifiers
Sri Lanka wins opener over Saudi Arabia 3/0

Sri Lanka opened their Junior Davis Cup (B-16) campaign in a winning note when they recorded a clean sweep victory (3-0) against Saudi Arabia in the Asia Oceania Pre-qualifying tie worked off at the Sri Lanka Tennis Association courts yesterday.
Kavisha Ratnayaka put Sri Lanka on winning track with a thrilling victory in the first rubber beating his Saudi opponent Qassem Mohammed Alobaidan 6/0, 6/7(6), 6/3. Kavisha won the first set comfortably, but it has been a tough battle in the following set as Qassem bounced back to win in a tie-breaker. Kavisha came up with some superb attacking performance in the third set and sealed his victory while putting Sri Lanka in a steady position.
Chathurya Nilaweera won the second singles beating Abdullah Tawfeeq in easy straight sets 6/1, 6/1. It has been a one sided game from the beginning as Lankan lad dominated the match through out.
Even though Kavisha and Chathurya entered the doubles match as much fancied pair after winning both singles, the Saudi duo Qassem and Tawfeeq handed them a shock defeat in the first set (4/6). Two Lankans displayed a good teamwork and turned the tables in the following two sets 6/3, 10/7 to record a clean sweep win in their opener.
