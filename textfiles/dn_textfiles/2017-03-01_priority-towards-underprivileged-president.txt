Priority towards underprivileged: President

The Government has given priority towards the welfare of the poor and underprivileged in this country, notwithstanding the economic challenges it faced on account of the World Economic Crisis, President Maithripala Sirisena said.
He was addressing the inaugural session of the workshop on ‘Sustainable Finance’ which commenced at the Central Bank auditorium, Colombo yesterday.
The President said nearly 30 percent of the population in this country were in abject poverty confronting dire economic problems and as such the government had given priority to their welfare by declaring 2017 as the poverty eradication year.
He said the government expected the support of all in the financial sector for the successful implementation of this programme.
The President who emphasised the importance of environmental conservation in overcoming economic problems and challenges added that the guidance of intellectuals and veterans in all fields was of paramount need for the Management of Sustainable Development policies.
He said Financial Policy and Management should follow a very successful path in future development work based on the development of physical sources along with environmental assessment. He also highlighted the need for the implementation of a national programme integrated with finance institutions led by the Central Bank, Environment Ministry and all other institutions connected to environmental conservation.
Central Bank Governor Indrajith Coomaraswamy, representatives of the IMF and World Bank and several local and foreign experts in the finance sector participated.
