Anilana Nilaveli Resort in 5th anniversary to offer special packages

Anilana Nilaveli Resort will be celebrating their fifth anniversary soon and would be offering special packages for locals.
For the first time the hotel will be offering a package that includes four meals and an extended check out time in a bid to offer longer stay at the hotel for guests.
“It takes around six hours to get to the hotel due to the lack of a highway and if the guests have to check out at the usual time of 12 noon on the following day it would not be a holiday. Hence we have decided to offer them a late check out giving them the option of checking in for breakfast (for travelers who use the night train) or check out after dinner,” said Group General Manager of the hotel, Indrajith Kumara.
Under the second phase of development the management is looking to build a second wing with another 20 rooms to offer it for the mid travel segment. A spa too would be introduced. “We will also introduce a larger conference facility to meet the growing demand for MICE events.”
Spread across an area of over six acres and with two swimming pools, Anilana Nilaveli is one of the heavily invested hotels in the entire North East. Owned and managed by Anilana Hotels and Properties Ltd the total investment for the project was Rs. 1.5 billion. The hotel has 54 luxurious rooms which includes 27 deluxe rooms, 18 pool chalets, six studios and three suites.
Most of the furniture and other amenities have been imported form USA to add more luxury to the property. Amenities of the hotel include flat screen LED TV with cable channels, writing table, and personal safe and personal bar. Complimentary tea and coffee are available with a personal coffee machine.
“We also organise weddings, honeymoon parties, Beach weddings with Dancers, Drummers and Elephants, anniversary dinners, special events, family gatherings, parties and meetings. We can also custom design packages that are tailor made to suit your requirements. Nothing is too small nor is any challenge too big.” “Intimate moonlit dinners for two under the stars in the beach too are very popular.”
The hotel also offers visits to places of interests that include excursions to Fort Frederick built by the Portuguese in the 17th century, grand Koneswaram Temple on Swami Rock cliff, Gokanna Temple, hot springs. In addition dolphin and Whale watching packages, diving, snorkeling water sports and boat tours too are offered.
