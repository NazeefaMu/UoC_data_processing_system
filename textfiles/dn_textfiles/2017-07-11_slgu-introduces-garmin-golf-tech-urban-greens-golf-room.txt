SLGU introduces Garmin golf tech at Urban Greens Golf Room

Sri Lanka Golf Union (SLGU) took another giant step towards developing and training trainers to impart knowledge and ‘swing- analysis’ to help golfers understand their swing and take their game to a higher level.
Truswing, a device that helps to monitor and provide information to view your own swing and correct the swing action of golfers, was handed over to newly trained coaches at a training event conducted at Urban Greens Golf Room at the Taj Samudra Hotel.
The event was organised by SLGU together with Techinnovators (Pvt) Ltd. - the sponsors and local distributor of Garmin Truswing devices. The handing over ceremony was attended by Sri Lankan Professionals, Trainers and Coaches.
“Golf swings need more accurate analysis to improve your game” said Priath Fernando, President, SLGU.
The small, lightweight and easy-to-use sensor measures the swing metrics golfers need to improve their game, and makes the data available immediately. Unlike other swing sensors currently on the market, TruSwing syncs wirelessly to a variety of approach devices, so golfers can get instant swing feedback right on their wrist after each swing.
This device will truly enable the coach to detect swing action errors and correct the student whilst training.
Device syncs through a smart phone and connects to Garmin connect app. where both coach and student could view a 3D virtual play of the swing action done seconds earlier. All data that’s collected is stored in one place within Garmin Connect. Each session is organized by date, so users can go back to see each individual swing and how they’ve improved since then. Garmin Connect can show golfers’ overall cumulative stats, as well as stats per session, which can be broken down by clubs used.
Weighing only 28 grams and measuring only 2.4”, TruSwing has an unobtrusive design that can be securely attached to any club below the grip. The robust attachment offers a firm grasps on the club, and the simple, quick design makes swapping between clubs a breeze.
TruSwing can get up to 12 hours of battery life on a single charge with plenty of storage to make it through multiple rounds before uploading to Garmin Connect.
TruSwing boasts an IPX-7 water rating, which can withstand the elements if golfers get caught in a sudden rainstorm.
Anyone can visit Urban Greens Golf Simulator at the Taj Samudra Hotel through the week and ‘try your hand’ in Air-conditioned comfort.
The Golf Simulator provides a driving range, and any selected golf course in the world to play on! The enjoyment of golf is doubled with the availability of coaching and electronic feed-back provided with the swing results on the ‘trueswing’ device.
Additionally, most of the local professional coaches in Sri Lanka can be consulted via Urban Greens Golf Room.
