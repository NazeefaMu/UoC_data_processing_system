Over 500 paddlers for WP TT C'Ships

Over 500 paddlers will vie for honours at the annual Western Province Chief Minister Trophy open ranking table tennis championship organised by the Western Province Table Tennis Association which will be worked off at the Indoor Stadium of St. Thomas' College, Mount Lavinia today and tomorrow (April 9th and 10th).
All top ranked players are expected to participate mens Junior and Senior National champion Udaya Ranasinghe and women's Junior National Champion 14 year old Samadhi Hettiarachchi and Senior Champion Nuwani Navodya.
The other top paddlers who will be in the fray are Sri Lanka's ladies captain Ishara Madurangi, former champion Erandi Warusawitharna, Hansani Piumila, Chamathsara Fernando, Ruvini Kannangara, Thanushi Rodrigo and Bhagya Tennakoon. Twenty year old Nuwani Navoddya created a major sensation the Table Tennis Nationals last year by winning it and it will be left to be seen whether she could repeat her success but she will receive tough opposition from Ishara Madurangi, Erandi Warusawitharna, Hansani Piumila and Ruvini Kannangara in the open event.
Udaya Ranasinghe of Vidyartha College is a gifted paddler who is just 16 years of age and he has won most of the major championships during the last few years and often making it one way traffic. But he will have to overcome the likes of former national champions Rohan Sirisena and Nirmala Jayasinghe and Chameera Ginige and to some extent from his own school from paddlers like Krishan Wickremaratne and Prasad de Silva.
