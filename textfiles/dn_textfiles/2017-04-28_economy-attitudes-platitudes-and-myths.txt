Economy: Attitudes, Platitudes and Myths

It is no secret that Sri Lanka lacks coherent national policies in most socio-economic fields. In fact the present government was formed as a coalition or a consensus government to formulate among others national policies in education, culture, economy etc. The need for such policies and the disadvantage of their absence are felt in many spheres. For example, the SAITM issue has raised several fundamental issues pertaining to a national policy on education.
More significant is the lack of a policy on national economic development. There is no economic strategy and often contrary policies are followed by different ministries in the government. Therefore, there exists an urgent need for formulating a national economic development strategy. A lively public debate on economic issues is the need of the hour. However, there are several attitudes, platitudes and myths regarding various economic aspects that should be cleared or sorted out.
For example, there is no agreement on what type of economy that suits the country at this juncture. Of course, there is agreement among the ruling parties that the model to be followed is the neo-liberal one. That is despite the rhetoric against it in public. All governments since 1977 have tried to embrace this model. Whatever failures in that respect were due largely on account of public resistance. Exigencies of retaining or gaining power through the ballot, which necessitated the maintenance of a state sector in the economy was another factor.
Efficiency, matter of management
However, it is now acknowledged even by many bourgeois economists of repute that the neo-liberal model has failed. Symbolically our politicians have been marketing the Singapore model, which is patently neo-liberal as the goal of our economic development. What should be remembered is apart from the outdated nature of that model, no two countries could have identical paths of development be it neo-liberal or socialist or anything else. Unlike Singapore which is a maritime city state Sri Lanka has much more diverse economic activities and traditions, a different labour force etc.
The neo-liberal model is based on the self-regulating nature of the market and is also known as market fundamentalism. However, there are no “pure’ self-regulating markets and they need government intervention or regulation to function at their optimum best.
Associated with it is also the theory that the state should shun business and should hand over all business and industrial activity to the private sector. While developing countries are prescribed as “small government,” developed countries continue to run or maintain large industrial or business enterprises and services. Even in the United States the state sector was strengthened at the height of the economic and monetary crisis of 2008.
Another fallacy propagated by the adherents of neo-liberalism is the relative efficiency of the private sector vis-à-vis the state sector. However, efficiency is a matter of management and is not an attribute of any particular sector. One could find efficient and inefficient ventures in all sectors. For example we have quite efficient state hospitals as compared with some private ones. The private omnibus services also provide an example of inefficiency and mismanagement. Nor is corruption a prerogative of the State sector alone. The collapse of some of the private financial agencies provides an example. Even globally the fall of Lehman Brothers is well-known.
In the context of a developing country a mixed economy is considered the best option. It means the co-existence of different sectors in the economy. Principally they are State, private and co-operative alongside certain others specific to particular countries. Contrary to widely held beliefs even socialist countries had and have mixed economies in their transition period. The ratio among various spheres is to be decided by the concrete situation at each particular period in each country.
There is also an aversion to national planning as seen from the low priority given to it for the last decade or so. Lack of national planning gives rise to anomalies among various sectors of the economy and hinders holistic development. In its opposition to the central planning conducted bureaucratically top-down some of our economists have thrown the baby also with the bath waters.
Export-oriented development strategy
In economics as well as in many other fields an objective analysis of the concrete situation taking to account all external and internal factors is mandatory. Hence, it would be obvious that Sri Lanka with its small internal market must have an export-oriented development strategy. Yet lack of sufficient savings and investments compels it to seek foreign investments. Complete opposition to foreign investments is a suicidal policy. This does not exclude the necessity to be selective in seeking foreign investment. What is necessary first of all are productive investments rather than those required for consumption expenses.
Finally, it must be stated that the ultimate success of any economic strategy would depend on how far it could raise the technological level of production and labor productivity in the country. Another factor that is almost neglected ad relegated to the background is the need for developing the cooperative sector in the economy. It is particularly important for improving the SME sector.
A land reform to empower the peasantry and scientific methods of cultivation suited to the nature of our agricultural lands is also an imperative need. We have to go beyond Vap magul ceremonies and crowning Govi Rajas.
