Man’s body found

A body of a male of about 30 years old was found floating in the sea opposite Siddhalepa Aurvedha Hotel, Pothupitiya, Wadduwa by Wadduwa police yesterday morning. An undershirt covered his upper part.
The dress of the lower part of the body might have washed away with the rough waves, police said.
Investigations are continuing.
