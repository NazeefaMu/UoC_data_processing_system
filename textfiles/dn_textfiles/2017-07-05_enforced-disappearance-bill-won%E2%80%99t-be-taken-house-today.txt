Enforced Disappearance Bill won’t be taken up in House today?

There is a possibility that Parliament would not take up the International Convention for the Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearance Bill today, a higher official in Parliament said.
The Bill is to give effect to the ‘International Convention for the Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearance’ to which Sri Lanka became a signatory on December 10, 2015. It has been scheduled to be taken up for debate today.
However, concerns have been raised lately over several clauses in the Bill. A higher official said the Bill might not be taken up today as scheduled.
