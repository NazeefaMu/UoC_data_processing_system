[CITIZENS' Mail - (16-10-2018)]

Sanga, please come and serve your country!
Kumar Sangakkara is a former Sri Lankan international cricketer and a former captain of the Sri Lankan national team.
He is widely regarded as one of the world’s most influential cricketers and one of the greatest batsmen of all time.
He is very actively involved in social activities. There is a proposal to invite Kumar Sangakkara to contest at the next presidential election. We very kindly request to Kumar Sangakkara to come forward and save the country of the following tragic situations by taking following actions:
Control bribery and corruption.
Control drug abuse and control drug trafficking.
Control the very sad political culture.
Eliminate extreme poverty.
Make loss making government organisations profit making ones.
Improve agriculture and industries.
Make the public sector corrupt free and efficient.
Give a solution to regular strikes, protests and agitations. Manage well the development projects and make this country a developed one.
We feel you are the only person who can help us at this junction. Country is in a very miserable situation. Politicians are trying to increase their salaries by 215 percent.
At present they are getting at least Rs. 300,000 salary plus allowances per month.
We want you to come forward. There is no other alternative. You have the required personality and leadership. We have to learn from Imran Khan.
We wish you courage and good luck. We are with you, Sir.
