KANDY SPORTS ROUND UP:
38th Trinity-St Anthony’s one-dayer today

The much-awaited one day cricket encounter between Trinity College and St. Anthony’s College, the 38th edition of the series will be played at the Katugasota ground today for the Richard Aluwihare trophy. Of the 37 games played so far both schools have 17 wins each, with 1 tied and 2 no results. The high riding Trinitians after the good show in the big match will be hoping to win this game, but when it comes to one day cricket, it’s not predictable. The two captains Hasitha Boyagoda (Trinity) and Janindu Himsara (St. Anthony’s) should remind their leading batsmen that the ball is meant to be hit and not play in a defensive manner especially in limited overs cricket. Last week’s big match that promised so much was cruelly ruined by rain and play ended by tea on the second day. So, this 39th encounter should see a good game of cricket. Teams: Trinity College - Hasitha Boyagoda (Captain), Trevon Percival, Rashmika Dilshan, Hasintha Jayasuriya, Vimukthi Nethumal, Budu Bandara, Avishka Senadheera, Kavishka Senadheera, Ruvin Pieris, Ashan Lokuketiya, Abishek Anandakumar, Chanuka Kumarasinghe, Himanga Suriyampola, Narendranath Ashok Kumar, Uvindu Imaldana, Jeff Weerasinghe.
St. Anthony’s College - Janidu Himsara (Captain), Theeksha Gunasinghe, Sunera Jayasinghe, Dion Stouter, Mohamed Absar, Jamashana Abeykoon, Navodya Vijaykumar, Kalhara Senaratne, Gihan Achintha, Sateesh Wickremaarachchi, Nimnaka Jayatilleka, Sasith Himdika, Mohamed Kameel, Gayan Samarasinghe, Savin Weerasinghe, Pramuditha Panditharatne.
