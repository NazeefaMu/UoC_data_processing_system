“Our cinema should position itself with ‘Made in Sri Lanka’ identity. Global village concept sheds light on talents galore shared by people in diverse cultures. The youth must indulge in filmmaking by adhering to their individual philosophies. Yet their thinking processes should be updated constantly in line with old traits of botanical culture. On scientifically grasping these facts with knowledge updating, our contemporary filmmakers could make films with an international appeal”, said Jackson.

We identify cultural diversity in cinema as American cinema, Indian cinema, French cinema, Iranian cinema, and so forth and so on. We further subdivide more heterogeneous segments in world cinema culture as regional and linguistic. For example, we divide western cinema as English, French, German or Russian cinema, emphasizing on language. Likewise in the world cinema map, Sinhala cinema still has a colour”.
