UN Commander bids farewell to SL troops in Mali

UN Contingent Sector East Commander in Mali (MINUSMA), Brigadier General A.T.M. Anisuzzaman (Bangladesh Army) recently paid a visit to the Sri Lankan Combat Convoy Company (CCC) stationed in Mali, prior to relinquishment of his office in Mali.
CCC troops greeted him to a Guard Turnout at the entrance and warmly welcomed him.
He felt extremely honoured and privileged to command such a professional outfit (SL CCC) under the blue helmet. SL CCC is doing a noble job and working hard to fulfill the mandate of the MINSUMA, Brigadier General Anisuzzaman.
