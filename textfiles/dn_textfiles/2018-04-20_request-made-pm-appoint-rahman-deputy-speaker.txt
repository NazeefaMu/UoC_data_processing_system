Request made to PM to appoint Rahman Deputy Speaker

A group of UNP backbenchers have written a letter to the Prime Minister asking UNP MP Mujibur Rahman be appointed as the Deputy Speaker of Parliament.
Reportedly, 20 UNPers had signed the letter.
The post fell vacant when former Deputy Speaker Thilanga Sumathipala resigned from the post in early March to actively take part in political work.
Sumathipala was also targeted to censure of the UNP for voting in favour of the No-Confidence Motion (NCM) against the Prime Minister as it was considered that Sumithipala voted in favour of the NCM whilst being the Deputy Speaker.
UNP MP Rahman speaking to Daily News said the UNPers had handed over the letter, but he was not sure how it would happen.
Under the arrangement of the national government, it had been previously agreed that if the UNP held the post of Speaker, the post of Deputy Speaker would go to the SLFP.
“It has to go to a SLFPer. I am not sure how it will work out,” Rahman said.
