No common policy in Govt.-GL

Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) leader Professor G.L.Peiris yesterday said that there is no common policy or a common agreement between the parties in the Unity Government.
He made this observation at a SLPP press brief held at Borella.
Professor Peiris also said that 16 SLFP MPs will cross over to the opposition and the rest of the SLFP members will remain with the government.
Peiris also said that Sri Lanka Freedom Party has lost its identity and its momentum.
He also questioned the policy statement which is to be delivered at the Parliament by President Maithripala Sirisena on May 8. He pointed out that shuffeling ministers here and there does not solve any problem in the country.
Peiris also said “any idiot” could rule a country like this and furthered that the living expenses are unbearable. He also said it was unfair to increase the gas price.
