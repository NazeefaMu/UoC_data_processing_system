Nearly 83,000 kgs of paddy to be sold at a loss

The Agriculture Department has decided to sell traditional paddy stocks stored at Anuradhapura Senanayake stores to the private sector at a loss. Nearly 83,000 kilograms of traditional paddy is reportedly being sold at Rs. 56 per kilo.
The decision is because the plan to cultivate traditional paddy in the Anuradhapura district on a large sale was unsuccessful.
The Farmer’s Trust Fund in collaboration with the Agriculture Department had bought the paddy two years ago at Rs. 70 to 80 per kilo from the Padaviya zone where the cultivation of traditional native paddy on a large scale was initiated.
The target was to cultivate 50,000 acres with traditional native paddy varieties such as Suwadel, Pachchaperumal Kuruluthuda, Heenati, Madathawalu, etc without using any agro chemical or artificial fertilizer except carbonic fertilizer by 2017. However, at present, the cultivation is limited to just around 7,000 acres.
According to farmers’ organizations in Padaviya, Siripura and Parakramapura, the farmers have given up the cultivation of traditional native paddy as a result of lethargy on the part of the Agriculture Department. The farmers complain that they were encouraged to grow traditional native paddy on the promise of adequate marketing facilities being provided to them with a higher price for the paddy. However, such promises were not fulfilled and the farmers were put into great inconvenience. The government boosted the traditional native paddy cultivation in the Anuradhapura district some years ago in view of the increasing kidney diseases in the district as traditional native rice possessed medicinal qualities to heal and prevent kidney ailments.
