Foreign markets to be explored to address tea industry crisis

Foreign markets will be explored for Sri Lankan tea to address the crisis in the tea industry, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said in Parliament yesterday.
He was responding to a question raised by UPFA MP Dullas Alahapperuma on the fall of prices of tea buds.
The Prime Minister said new markets for tea will be explored in countries such as India, Pakistan, Turkey and Iran. He said the Tea Export Board was granted Rs. 1 billion by the Treasury to provide relief for affected tea smallholders due to the prevailing crisis.
“We met stakeholders in the tea industry recently. Money was disbursed to provide for relief,” he said.
The Prime Minister said tea exports had not reached new markets over the past years. Tea had been exported mainly to Russia. “There is no way that we can inquire into this matter, as the former Sri Lankan Ambassador to Russia and Ukraine is missing,” he said.
The Prime Minister said the government perseveres to protect tea smallholders and labourers attached to the tea industry.
Replying to a supplementary question by MP Alahapperuma, the Prime Minister said the crisis in the international tea market is worse than the situation in 2008.
“The economy of Russia and Ukraine had been affected. There are conflicts in the Middle East,” he said.

Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe yesterday in Parliament complimented Opposition Leader R. Sampanthan for raising a matter of national importance.
The Prime Minister made this observation after the Opposition Leader raised the matter of HNDA students by asking a question under Standing Order 23(2). “I thank the Opposition Leader for raising this matter. He proved that he would take up the issues pertaining to the North and the South alike.
This indicated that he is a true national leader of the Opposition.
I hope that he would continue this practice even in the future,” the Prime Minister said.

Speaker to inquire into military deployment close to Parliament
Speaker Karu Jayasuriya yesterday in Parliament said that he did not call for the deployment of military personnel close to Parliament. He would present a report to the House after looking into the matter, he said.
The Speaker made these observations in reply to a charge by MP Dinesh Gunawardena that the Speaker had deployed Police and military personnel near the Parliament road to obstruct the students who were protesting, from entering Parliament.
The Speaker rejecting the claim of MP Gunawardena asked him not to make false allegations against him. The Speaker warned MP Gunawardena to be mindful of his conduct in Parliament. “You are a senior MP, but you resorted to disturb the business of the House. I observed this for several days. I regret your conduct,” he said.
Even though the Speaker assured that he would inquire as to who gave orders to deploy Army personnel near Parliament, MP Gunawardena continued to protest without allowing the Speaker to proceed on the business of the House. The Speaker refused to provide a microphone to MP Gunawardena stating that he had been repeating the same for nearly 20 minutes.
“I allowed ample time for you to speak. I told you that I will inquire into the matter. Do not disturb the proceedings of the House,” he said.
MP Gunawardena took his seat and the protesting MPs in the Opposition also followed him ending their protest.

High defence authorities provide security for Parliament - Deputy Speaker
Deputy Speaker Thilanga Sumathipala said yesterday that the security arrangements of Parliament were designed and put in place by high defence authorities of the country.
The Deputy Speaker addressing a press conference at the Parliamentary Complex, said that the Army was not called to provide security to Parliament yesterday. It was wrong that MEP Leader Dinesh Gunawardena has said the Speaker had summoned the Army to stop the university students' protest march towards Parliament.
Police and STF commandos provided security on roads leading to Parliament as intelligence agencies have reported that some student protestors marching from the Sri Jayewardenepura University may come towards Parliament.
"The deployment of security personnel to prevent such intrusions is not our task," Deputy Speaker Sumathipala said.
The security authorities were bound by the duty to ensure the protection of Parliament. The security of Parliament is not a party matter, he said.
Meanwhile, the Deputy Speaker said the human rights sessions of the Inter-Parliamentary Union (IPU) in Geneva held recently were progressive for the country.
The delegation had explained that investigations and hearing procedures with regard to murders of two MPs, T Maheshwaran and DM Dassanayake were nearing completion.
"We requested them to drop the item from the IPU human rights agenda. But the decision would be taken by the eight-member committee which we don't have access. The IPU accepted our proposal," he said.
