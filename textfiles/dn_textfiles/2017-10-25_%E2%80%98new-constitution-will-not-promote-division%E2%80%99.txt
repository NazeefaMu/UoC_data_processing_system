‘New Constitution will not promote division’

Various parties and stakeholders have submitted different proposals towards formulating a new Constitutions. They are only the ideas and views of the respective parties and stakeholders. But a new Constitution draft bill has not even been formulated, said Fisheries and Aquatic Resources Development Minister Mahinda Amaraweera.
Given that situation, certain politicians are tying to create a storm in a teacup by uttering falsehoods about a new Constitutions which had not even been drafted yet, he said.
The minister said he would categorically state that they would never allow to harm the pre- eminent position afforded to Buddhism or a division of the country through the proposed new Constitution.
He was addressing a meeting after inaugurating the construction work on the Viharamahadevipura fisheries housing scheme in Kirinda on October 22. This is the third such village built under the ‘Dheevara Piyasa’ programme.
The minister said the ‘Dheevara Piyasa’ housing programme was formulated by the ministry to relieve the fishery community from debt.
This was different to certain other housing schemes which made the beneficiaries indebted to banks.
