Biopic on Irrfan’s life would be a mistake

Biopics and biographies are on a roll these days; especially in Bollywood. Not only are films being made on celebrated personalities but some Bollywood celebrities are coming up with their own biographies as well. After Karan Johar and Rishi Kapoor, the recent one being Nawazuddin Siddiqui. When Irrfan Khan was asked if he too was keen on getting a biography written, he told a daily that biography is not on his mind. Irrfan reportedly feels that going around praising himself is too boring a thing to do.
Irrfan added in the report that he doesn’t want people to sensationalise the episodes of his life.
However, the actor reportedly also mentioned that the only way to get him to be part of biography is to moving the focus of the narration from him to key anecdotes and episodes from his life.
He even reportedly dismissed the idea of a biopic being made on him citing that a biopic on his life won’t make up for an interesting script. Irrfan reportedly feels a biopic on his life would be a mistake.
