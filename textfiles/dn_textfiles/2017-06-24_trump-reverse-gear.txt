Trump in reverse gear

On June 16 President Donald Trump announced a series of measures that roll back the positive developments in relations between the United States and revolutionary Cuba that took place during the final days of President Barack Obama’s presidency.
Among the measures announced were the prohibition of economic, commercial and financial relations of US companies with Cuban companies, related to the Ministry of Revolutionary Armed Forces and the Ministry of the Interior, prohibition of individual travel by US citizens in the category vi-to-people exchange, and revision of subversive programmes against the Cuba to make them more effective. President Obama also recognized the independence, sovereignty and self-determination of Cuba. This was also repealed by President Trump. However, he stopped short of breaking diplomatic relations which in any case had not yet taken off the ground.
Obviously Trump has gone back on the policy initiated by President Obama. His new measures indicate a set-back in Cuba- United States relations and a return to the policies of the Cold War. It affects US commercial interests and the freedom of US citizens more than it affects Cuba. The latter has developed for over six decades despite US hostility, aggression, subversion and a criminal blockade amounting to genocide according to international law.
However, President Trump’s new move is not likely to gain popularity. A recent survey has shown that 73 percent of Americans support the lifting of the blockade against Cuba. Further, 63 percent of them are Cuban Americans. Also 62 percent of the Republicans (to which Trump belongs) support the lifting of the blockade. Similarly 75 percent of US citizens favour the normalization of relations between Cuba and the United States.
Responding to President Trump’s new measures Cuba has reiterated its principled position that it is always ready to normalize relations with the United States on the basis of mutual respect and the acceptance of its dignity, sovereignty and right of self-determination.
La Républica en Marche stuns France with historic victory
President Macron’s La Républica en Marche party has swept the Parliamentary polls in France with a stunning historic victory. Though only a year old it together with the MoDem party won 350 seats, in the 577 seat Legislature. According to the final results the Republican Party and its allies received only 137 seats instead of the 200 they had in the earlier Parliament. The Socialists and their allies could only win 44 seats. Communists and their allies won 27 seats. Noteworthy is the huge setback for the ultra-right National Front which won only 9 seats.
However, President Macron has a difficult job reconciling the diverse and often contrary interests of his Right Wing and Left Wing allies. He has vowed clean Government. Already the MoDem Party has withdrawn three Ministers from the Government on account of investigations that have been initiated against alleged misdeeds of those ministers. Despite such set-backs President Macron has a strong position in the Legislature that he would be a formidable President even much more than legendary General De Galle. Even in the international arena, France is likely to see a rise in its stature under President Macron. A strong supporter of European unity he has the backing of European nations with different policies, for example of Britain and Germany. This places France in a strategic role.
US-Russia relations take a nose-dive
Relations between the United States and Russia took a nose-dive in June. They reached the lowest depth since the birth of new Russia after the fall of the Soviet Union in the early 1990’s.
Resurgent Russia under President Putin has gained much of its former strength and glory witnessed during the Soviet era. It has become an indispensable player in world developments. It has already shown its capabilities in the Syrian conflict by consolidating stability in the region with its resolute action against ISIS terrorists.
Despite hiccups experienced earlier its relations with key players in the conflict zone in West Asia and Mediterranean nations have improved. Relations with Turkey are an example. It is largely due to the support extended by Russia that a domino effect in the region could be saved by preventing the fall of Syria following the debacles in Iraq and Libya. It has also succeeded in halting the expansion of NATO to the Black Sea.
