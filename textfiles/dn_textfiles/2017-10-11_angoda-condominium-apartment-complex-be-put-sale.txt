Angoda condominium apartment complex to be put up for sale

 
The 500 unit condominium apartment complex in Angoda built for low income families in Colombo has been put up for sale as the families have refused to move from their shanties in Colombo to condominiums in Angoda.
The ‘Urban Regeneration Project’ under the Ministry of Megapolis and Western Development had proposed to build a five storied condominium apartment complex on five acres in the Angoda Hospital premises.
The Ministry had proposed this as a solution to removing underserving settlements from the heart of Colombo. The overall goal of the Urban Regeneration Project was to build 70,000 housing units to resettle the low income families.
The low income families however have stated that they were not willing to move to Angoda, given their children’s education, access to work and other amenities and facilities. 
Minister of Megapolis and Western Development, Champika Ranawaka this week submitted a cabinet proposal to sell these flats to members of the tri-forces, lower middle income government servants, artists, small and medium businessmen and women and civil activists.
Cabinet thus granted approval on Tuesday to publish advertisements in the newspapers and call for interested parties to purchase these flats. The unit built at a cost of Rs 3.4 million each is to be sold between Rs 4-5 million.
The apartment complex is expected to be complete by the end of this year.
