Call for value-added products for bulk exports

Wewili Sawiya launched:
Plantation Industries Minister Navin Dissanayake stressed the importance of substituting value-added products for bulk exports to meet foreign market needs.
The minister was addressing the launching ceremony of Wewili Sawiya, the official newspaper of the Plantation Ministry at the Associated Newspapers of Ceylon Limited (ANCL), yesterday.
The newspaper is a joint collaboration of the Plantation Industries Ministry and the ANCL.
Minister Dissanayake said Sri Lanka’s plantation sector must move forward with value added exports under Sri Lankan brands. Around 60 percent of the products exported from Sri Lanka is in the form of bulk. Another 40 percent are exported as value-added products.
The minister said Sri Lanka has been able to diversify export products and markets but that value addition was not enough. Therefore, the ministry has taken measures to encourage value added exports from Sri Lanka with the intention of increasing the production of value-added exports up to 60 percent from the country’s total exports.
As the second largest foreign exchange earner of the country, the plantation sector comprising tea, rubber and coconut, continues to play an important role in the national economy. During the second quarter, Sri Lanka could be able to enhance the production of tea, he said.
“Receiving the best price for local products in the international market is not enough to achieve expected goals in the plantation sector. We should improve the production and the quality of the products as well,” said the minister.
He stressed the importance of finding new market opportunities without depending on textile and plantation sectors.
We should focus our attention on the country’s intellectual property, he said.
“Although the country invests a large amount of money on education, we have not yet been able to get the maximum use of this investment,” he added. Plantation Industries Ministry Secretary J. A. Ranjith and ANCL General Manager Abhaya Amaradasa also addressed the gathering.
