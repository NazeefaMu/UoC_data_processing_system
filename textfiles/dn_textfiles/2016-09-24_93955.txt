Nalanda, Mahinda continue strong form in Murali Harmony Cup

Nalanda College continued with their impressive early-tournament form with another clinical display on day two of the Murali Harmony Cup 2016, defeating Kalutara Maha Vidyalaya to remain group leaders.
Batting first, Nalanda made 118 runs thanks to a sensible run-a-ball 51 by SD Wijewardana who anchored the innings for his team. Lakshan and Silva were impressive with the ball for KMV each bagging 3 wickets for 27 runs.
Set a target of 119, KMV were in all sorts of early trouble as Subasinghe struck for Nalanda with three quick top order wickets sending Jayawardena, Kavinda and Nayanajith back to the pavilion without scoring.
KMV never could recover from their bad start and were eventually bowled out for 66.
Mahinda (126 runs) had a close call against Kingswood College (121/7) as they won by 5 runs at Mullativu in what was easily the match of the day.
Batting first, Mahinda stumbled earlier on as they lost their first two wickets for 12 runs. However a collective batting effort which rallied around skipper Welihinder (39 runs with 4 x 4’s and 2 x 6’s) saw them through to a decent total.
A target of 122 was always going to be a challenge for Kingswood given the depth of Mahinda’s bowling.
However, Kingswood did well in the middle overs with Liyanage and skipper Chandrasiri scoring 29 and 27 respectively to bridge the gap.
Kaushalya (19) and Wijesiriwardena (11) batted well under pressure however, thanks to some brilliant fielding by the Mahinda wicket-keeper Dulsara who affected two brilliant run outs.
The last six balls of the game went without a single run being conceded and Mahinda walked back victorious and unbeaten.
