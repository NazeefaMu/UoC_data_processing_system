Cinnamon Life Business Forum series kicks off with Andreas Krüger

Cinnamon Life, Sri Lanka’s largest and most iconic integrated multi-functional development project to date, in association with Ceylon Chamber of Commerce and German Development Cooperation (GIZ), hosted the first chapter of the Cinnamon Life Forum series yesterday. Leading the first event in the highly-anticipated thought leadership series will be world renowned property policy expert and Managing Partner of Belius GmbH, Berlin – Andreas Krüger, who explored the pertinent topic of creative placemaking and entrepreneurship in the 21st century.
The Cinnamon Life Business Forum series was launched to share powerful ideas that will ultimately help to shape Colombo into a dynamic and competitive city. By exploring the subject of modern day placemaking and entrepreneurship, Krüger tackled a wide array of important areas, including political, government and public administration policymaking, understanding of roles, stakeholder monitoring and provided an overview of recommended methods and process innovation.
He also touched on smart participation and collaboration formats, economic and financial feasibility, as well as the need to embrace a respectful, transparent and accessible culture of dialogue, communications and marketing.
The first segment of the forum addressed the key questions in the field of innovative placemaking and entrepreneurship in modern times, whilst empowering Sri Lanka’s top business audiences to conceptualize thoughtful frameworks and resources to power physical, digital and financial platforms.
In addition, Krüger also delivered exclusive insights from the drastic transformation of Berlin, a dynamic and fast-paced city that thrives on entrepreneurial drive, contrast and creativity. These valuable insights, coupled with useful learnings from some of Krüger’s projects such as Moritzplatz and Prinzessinnengärten, will collectively shed light on the important role that citizens and residents play in the development of a city and its governance, whilst fostering the understanding of behavioral changes that are required to keep a city constantly evolving and transforming.
Raised in north Germany and currently based in Berlin, Andreas Krüger is a multidisciplinary expert with decades of experience in the fields of creative placemaking, content related space strategies, urban humanity, artist interventions and cultural and creative working processes. He also has in-depth knowledge of the areas of international exchanges, urban development, urban planning, property policy, construction and real estate, among others. Krüger currently serves at the helm of Belius, a Berlin based strategic consultancy, which supports policymakers, urban administrations, property owners and investors, users as well as civic initiatives. His team helps them in their efforts to create and maintain human centered, livable, relevant and economically feasible spaces. Additionally, Krüger specializes in curating urban residences and developments for cultural, retail and commercial as well as residential use.
Commenting on spearheading the first event of the Cinnamon Life Forum series, Krüger, Managing Partner of Belius GmbH, Berlin, stated: “I am pleased to have been invited to participate at the Cinnamon Life Business Forum series and kickstart this innovative initiative, that will help to reshape the city of Colombo. Though Sri Lanka has evolved steadily and progressed rapidly since the end of the civil conflict, the country has yet to see a mixed development as large as Cinnamon Life making a mark on its skyline and economy. I hope that these talks will showcase the role that this project and the country’s rapidly growing real estate industry at large, will play in the development and positioning of the city of Colombo both regionally and internationally.”
Cinnamon Life is a mixed development by Sri Lanka’s premier listed conglomerate, the John Keells Group. Upon completion, the project will comprise an 800-roomed luxury Cinnamon Hotel, an array of entertainment facilities, apartments, retail and entertainment malls, office spaces, and many other attractions.
The development’s iconic design by Cecil Balmond will span across 4.5 million square feet, and it envisioned to be the epicentre of modern South Asia. Designed to be the first multi-functional development of its kind in the country, and a city within a city, Cinnamon Life is set to strengthen Colombo’s position as a travel, trade, lifestyle and entertainment hotspot in the Indian Subcontinent.
