SLT and University of Peradeniya sign MoU

Sri Lanka Telecom, the national telecommunication service provider entered into a landmark agreement with the University of Peradeniya, one of the top ranked universities in Sri Lanka that is also well known for its cutting edge research, to carry out collaborative ICT research projects as well as to establish a new state of the art R & D centre at Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, University of Peradeniya.
The MoU was signed recently at the University by Prof. Upul B. Dissanayake, Vice Chancellor of the University of Peradeniya and Tilak De Silva, Chief Business Innovation Officer of SLT. This futuristic step was undertaken with the main vision of providing a suitable platform for researchers from a wide variety of disciplines to come together to engage in research and development activities.
Prof. Upul B. Dissanayake, sharing his views on the partnership said, "University-Industry collaboration has been of great importance today more than ever before due to the fast evolving nature of industry as well as industrial practices. This requires intensive use of knowledge as well as research. As a result, high quality human resources become a vital need. This partnership and this research facility will enhance the availability of highly qualified human resources in the areas of R&D within the country.”
Speaking on the partnership and the long-term objectives of the initiative, Tilak De Silva, said, "There is a growing need for innovation and development in ICT to match rising world expectations. Further, the rapid development of technology and industry can exert pressure on our graduates to meet the growing demands of the corporate sector, which they could find difficult to meet, due to their lack of exposure.”
This landmark agreement will help develop a mutually beneficial framework so that SLT can provide support in the form of material, finance, human resources and testing facilities to the University to conduct research activities.
