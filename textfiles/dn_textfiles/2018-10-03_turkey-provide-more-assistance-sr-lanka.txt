Turkey to provide more assistance to Sr Lanka

Turkish Ambassador to Sri Lanka Tunca Ozcuhadar said yesterday, that Turkey is ready to continue supporting Sri Lanka’s development projects and also provide technical and humanitarian assistance.
He stated that Turkey provides assistance to a number of countries around the world through the (Turkish Cooperation and Coordination Agency) TIKA, Turkish Red Crescent Society and several Turkish NGOs.
The Ambassador was speaking at a ceremony to donate a 3D printer to the Peradeniya University Agriculture Faculty at the Turkish Embassy premises.
Ambassador Ozcuhadar said that the donation was aimed at improving knowledge among the youth and allowing them to find better jobs.
“Our humanitarian assistance policy is development-oriented. While providing humanitarian aid such as delivering food and medicine to a country in need, Turkey will also simultaneously facilitate capacity building programmes, construct essential infrastructure and providing education, sanitation and health services,” he added.
“Turkey has already undertaken a housing project in Mannar and has already built 100 houses as a first stage while 450 houses already built for Tsunami victims in the Southern Province. We have engaged in providing financial assistance for the repairing of water dams in several areas while donating computers and construing medical centers in several schools islandwide,” the Turkish Ambassador said.
He further said that Turkey is a strong advocate of international solidarity and partnership and that Turkey provided US$ 8 billion worth humanitarian and technical assistance world-wide in 2017. We believe that a country can truly archive a sustainable growth only through development-oriented assistance.
By donating a 3D printer to the Peradeniya University, Turkey could help Sri Lankan youth acquire vital skills and enrich the workforce in Sri Lanka.
