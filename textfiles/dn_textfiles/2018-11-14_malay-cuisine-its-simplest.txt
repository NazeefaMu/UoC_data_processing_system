Malay cuisine at its simplest

Hundreds of visitors thronged the Padang Complex to indulge in exotic Sri Lanka Malay cuisine recently. Several food stalls offered an array of popular Malay dishes, like Nasi Goreng, Satay Daging, Pittu, Cukka, Babath and Pasthol complemented with sweetmeats that included Cheena Kueh, Dosi Nannas, Agar Agar as well as Serikaya.
There were several handicraft and trade stalls as well, to complement the assortment of food stalls, which also added more excitement to the visitor. They were also enthralled by the Cultural performances depicting Malay dances presented by the Youth in traditional Malay costumes and also the music and songs provided a memorable entertaining evening. A mini Fashion Show was the Finale of the cultural show, showcasing a range of beautiful Malay attires, both for the male as well as the female which was a fitting tribute to an evening, which created a riot of colour, music, dance and food.
Malaysian High Commissioner Yang Thai Tan was the Guest of Honor.
