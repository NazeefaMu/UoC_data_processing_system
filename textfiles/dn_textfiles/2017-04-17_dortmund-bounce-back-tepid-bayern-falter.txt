Dortmund bounce back as tepid Bayern falter

DORTMUND, Saturday - Borussia Dortmund bounced back from the trauma of the bomb attack on their team bus and their Champions League defeat in midweek to earn an emotion-filled 3-1 home win over Eintracht Frankfurt in the Bundesliga on Saturday.
Champions and leaders Bayern Munich saw their advantage at the top cut to eight points after they were held to a 0-0 draw at 10-man Bayer Leverkusen, having missed a barrage of chances without their injured top scorer Robert Lewandowski.
The result left Bayern on 69 points from 29 games while second-placed RB Leipzig have 61 after booking Champions League football next season for the first time in the club's history with a 4-0 home win over Freiburg.
Dortmund fans gave their players a rousing reception back at the Westfalenstadion after their tumultuous week and ended up cheering goals from Marco Reus, Sokratis Papastathopoulos and Pierre-Emerick Aubemayang.
Their opening goal came in just two minutes after a slick one-two with Aubameyang saw American teenager Christian Pulisic use his pace to catch Eintracht goalkeeper Lukas Hradecky in no man's land. The American kept his composure to find Reus in front of goal for a stunning back-heeled finish on his return from a month out with injury. Eintracht had two good chances before Mexican Marco Fabian equalised only for a right-footed shot from Papastathopoulos to restore Borussia's lead 10 minutes before half-time.
