DELAY IN TREATING HIGH FEVER:
GALAHA TENSE AFTER INFANT’S DEATH

The Police Special Task Force and riot squads had to be deployed following a tense situation outside the Galaha Hospital yesterday. The situation arose following the death of an infant who had been admitted to the hospital for treatment.
An angry mob close to 2,000 attacked the hospital forcing the Police to be deployed to provide security to the premises and the staff.
The crowd alleged that the one and half year old child had died following a delay in administering treatment at the hospital. The infant’s parents said no treatment had been given to their child for at least two hours. The child had high fever and later suffered a seizure, they said. The parents had then taken the child to the Peradeniya hospital in a trishaw but the child had died before reaching the hospital.
The parents charged the hospital staff had taken steps to transfer two other patients with head injuries to the Peradeniya hospital in the only ambulance the hospital had but had ignored the plight of their child. The angry mob had damaged hospital property and several vehicles parked in the premises.
Central Province Health Director Dr.Shanthi Samarasinghe said she had immediately transferred the doctors at the hospital to another one.
She said an investigation will be conducted.
