Japan stuns South Korea 60-3

On a glorious sunny day at Asiad Rugby Field, the Japanese Brave Blossoms ran in 10 tries. But it was their defensive effort that pleased every one with 60 points to 3 win against South Korea in the end in Incheon, South Korea.
Japan gave up the first score of the game when Korean flyhalf Oh Ji Myeong banged over a penalty from halfway. But it was all Japan after that.
Atsushi Sakate opened the scoring for Japan in the fifth minute and the hooker was followed onto the score sheet in the first half by captain Keisuke Uchida (another superb individual effort) and Ryohei Yamanaka, who bagged a quick fire brace.
The Brave Blossoms were also awarded a penalty try and Yamanaka and Ryota Nakamura added a conversion apiece to make it 29-3 at the break.
Sakate opened the second half with his second try (like his first the result of a great driving maul) and there were further five-pointers for Kentaro Kodama, Kotaro Yatabe, Takuhei Yasuda and Ryuji Noguchi with Yamanaka adding two more conversions and Nakamura one.
However Japan coach said his side’s kicking game was a lot better as was their intent to play the game in the right part of the field.
Japan have 15 points from three games and play Hong Kong in Round 5, with the final game of the tournament set for June 4 when South Korea visit Hong Kong. (WAI)
