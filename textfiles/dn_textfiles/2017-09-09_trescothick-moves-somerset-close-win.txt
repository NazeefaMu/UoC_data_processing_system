Trescothick moves Somerset close to win

LONDON: Marcus Trescothick hit an unbeaten 119 as Somerset moved towards a win over Warwickshire on day three of the English County Championship at Edgbaston.
Continuing on 36 not out, 41-year-old Trescothick put on 148 with James Hildreth (68) to declare on 265-4, setting the hosts 402 runs to win.
Jonathan Trott (74) battled hard, but Tim Groenewald's 3-34 and two late wickets from Dom Bess left Warwickshire on 172-6, needing 230 runs to win.
Lancashire added valuable lower-order runs to post 290 all out against Essex before reducing the Division One leaders to 115-4 at Old Trafford.
Jamie Porter (5-73) completed a five-wicket haul by removing Lancashire opener Haseeb Hameed (88), who added only three to his overnight score. Tom Bailey (34 not out) and Kyle Jarvis (26) put on 57 for the 10th wicket.
With bad weather also preventing any play on day one, a draw looks the most likely result between the two Championship title challengers. Unbeaten Essex began the match 36 points clear of second-placed Lancashire, with both teams having three more matches to play this season.
Surrey will take a slender lead of 45 runs into the final day after Gareth Berg led a Hampshire counter-attack.
Beginning day three on 129-7, Hampshire made 290 - a first-innings lead of 90 - with runs from Berg (80), Ian Holland (51) and Kyle Abbott (37 not out).Liam Dawson (2-24) continued his good bowling form to reduce Surrey to 51-3.
Bad light and rain limited Yorkshire and Middlesex to only 45 overs of play on day three as their Division One game at Headingley headed for a draw. Resuming on 317-7, Yorkshire secured a fourth batting bonus point before being bowled out for 358.
Middlesex openers Sam Robson (47) and Nick Compton (42) put on 73 for the first wicket of their reply. But Ryan Sidebottom took three wickets to leave the visitors on 108-3 when play was abandoned.
Unbeaten Division Two leaders Nottinghamshire are on the verge of defeat by fellow promotion contenders Worcestershire at Trent Bridge. The visitors ended day three on 123-2 in pursuit of 226 for victory and need 103 more runs with eight wickets left.
Veteran captain Read received a guard of honour from the Worcestershire players as he entered the field for his final innings at Trent Bridge before he retires at the end of the season.
Liam Norwell took five wickets to keep Gloucestershire on course for victory at Leicestershire before bad light stopped play at Grace Road. Gloucestershire added 150 runs to their overnight total of 218-3 before being bowled out shortly after lunch. The hosts continued to struggle as they closed on 154-7 when play was abandoned, a lead of eight runs.
Tom Latham and Graham Clark extended Durham's lead to 156 runs before rain stopped play against Kent on day three. Latham (64 not out) and Clark (49 not out) moved the score onto 145-2 without losing a wicket in a important 106-run partnership for the hosts. But rain and bad light stalled the progress of Paul Collingwood's side as only 28 overs were bowled in the day.
Sussex's batsmen staged a late fightback to maintain hope of salvaging their Division Two game against Northamptonshire at the County Ground.
Sussex started on 34-1 after being made to follow on, trailing by 220 runs. Angus Robson (72) and Chris Nash (66) frustrated Northants, but their side were in trouble at 246-8. Jofra Archer (74 not out) and David Wiese (61) gave Sussex some hope by the close, with an aggressive 127-run stand taking them to 382-9.
Derbyshire were restricted to 236-9 against Glamorgan as their Championship match finally got under way after two blank days. Lukas Carey was the pick of the visitors’ attack with 3-49, despite three dropped catches off his bowling.
