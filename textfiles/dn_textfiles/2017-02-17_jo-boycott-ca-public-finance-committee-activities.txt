JO to boycott CA Public Finance Committee activities

The Joint Opposition (JO) members in the Public Finance Committee of the Constitutional Assembly have decided to boycott committee activities, UPFA parliamentarian Bandula Gunawardena said.
He alleged that the government was trying to introduce federalism to the country through the new Constitution.
The MP said the government has already drafted a Constitution secretly. Gunawardena said he was the chairman of the committee, and the committee members agreed that the central government and Parliament should have control over public finance.
Parliament should have the responsibility with regard to government revenue, taxes, expenditure and foreign loans, he said.
Gunawardena said former President Mahinda Rajapaksa and the Joint Opposition have already announced that they would not support any constitutional reform that would be detrimental to the country’s sovereignty and territorial integrity.
Six subcommittees were set up as supporting bodies to the Steering Committee. These committees will develop constitutional principles for the consideration of the Steering Committee in respect of the designated subject areas, the MP said.
Speaking at a press conference at the former President’s office in Battaramulla, Gunawardena said the joint opposition members of the public fiancé committee participated in eight committee meetings and this committee obtained the assistance from experts from many institutions including the Finance Ministry, Auditor General’s Department and Inland Revenue Department.
