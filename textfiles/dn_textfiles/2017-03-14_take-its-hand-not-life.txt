Take its hand, not life !

Forced birth-control NGO culture Vs. duty of Good Governance government – Part 1
If the present writer is to begin with the end, what has to be stressed is the following: Nation is a notion of illusion and that which vitalizes nation in to an existential reality and with life is, the child. Without children, with the fathers of infertility and in the presence of the mothers of sterility, the final result, a nation can expect is its own extinction, its total cessation and its nullification in to disappearance. Hence, forced birth control and abortion, the vested interest conspiracy propaganda of “Planned Golden Family”, with less or no children, the concept of unwanted pregnancy, the campaign, being launched to secure individual rights to become childless, the strategy of sterilization in the guise of reproductive health, the drum beat of economic prosperity potential, through the abortion and birth control are poisoned psychologies, introduced to ruin the nation in the years to come.
The Government of Good Governance was elected by the people, not to be preyed in to this pernicious venom, secreted by certain NGO pythons, but to be consciously aware of them, be persistent, perseverant and crush their atrocious efforts and designs, to destroy the nation, particularly, the Sinhala Buddhists.
The central tasking principle of any Government Governance, if it genuinely wants to be seeded in the maxim of goodness, is not blind belief in all, what is being exported from the West, but, nourishment of what is domestically ethical, historically existential and well approved by the majority community. Sri Lanka, the Heladiva, has such a beautiful maxim, to be more precise, the protection of the right to life, from the moment of its prenatal conception.
All nation-lovers, patriots, religious priests, social and community forces, the justice administration community, the Army and Police and certainly people-elected politicians, should get together and fight against this heinous crime of chopping the raw flesh of the neck of yet unborn fetuses, conceived in the wombs of our innocent mothers, not allowing them to peacefully grow in to beautiful and healthy children.
Power of media
Thus, in view of the above, it is deemed extremely expedient and truly timely that firm and continuous measures must be taken to engender a conscious awareness of this danger of forced birth control and abortion, in order to save the nation from a catastrophe, clandestinely being conspired to ensnare the nation in the trap of extinction. Herein, the media corporations, printing, broadcasting and telecasting, must be insisted in to volunteerism and also the internet and the face book medium should be used to proliferate a sense of urgency, to generate a forced-abortion and birth-control-battling-awareness, so that the innocent community members will be conscious, being conscious vigilant, being vigilant active and empirically engaged, in the extirpation of the exacerbation of the forced abortion and birth control.
International law flaw and abortion
The right to abortion, to birth control, to the artificial contraception access, for the most part, seem to have taken root, through the jurisprudential interpretations of domestic and international law.
Thus, Article 1 of the Universal declaration of Human Rights writes: "All human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights” . International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights stipulates:” Article 6:1- “Every human being, has the inherent right to life. This right shall be protected by law. No one shall be arbitrarily deprived of his life”. Convention on the Rights of the Child – Preamble envisions - “Bearing in mind that, as indicated in the Declaration of the Rights of the Child, “the child, by reason of his physical and mental immaturity, needs special safeguards and care, including appropriate legal protection, before as well as after birth”. Article 1 postulates “For the purposes of the present Convention, a child means every human being below the age of eighteen years unless under the law applicable to the child, majority is attained earlier”.
Now, from the above article content contexts, it is explicitly evident that the international legal etymology retains a definite and specific ambiguity, with no terminological and contextual unanimity at all. One refers to the born being with no allusion to prenatal fetus.
The other concerns safeguard and care of the child before and after the birth. Yet, it is not only pathetic, but truly cruel that the jurisprudential interpretations and international judicial practice and experience of juridical proceedings, seem to have granted preference and priority to the born being, totally deserting the life-potential fetus, empirically conceived in the womb of mother.
These so-called legal experts argue that the prenatal protection of the fetus would create a conflict of law, with the propensity of threat, to infringe the rights of the woman. This is an international law flaw and a jurisprudential dimension, commanding a much focused analytical and globally central attention.
The law must be refined and redefined in order to protect and defend its rights to be born, indeed, striking a judicial, jurisprudential and juridical balance between the rights of the mother and the rights of the conceived fetus.
This is not impossible. Hence, what is deserved by the abortion and forced birth control proponents is not commendation, but condemnation. The Government of the Good Governance of Sri Lanka can be proactive and with the direct assistance of the power of media, it can galvanize in to action, in order to proclaim a new, fresh and fragrant ontologico-jurisprudential invention in the orientation of the protection of the rights of the prenatal fetus, potential with the most precious, the life.
Deception of rights violation
The whole world recognizes that the right to life is a fundamental human right, central to the enjoyment of all other human rights.
(a) Yet, unfortunately, though not all, some international human rights legal norms recognize, that, this basic right begins at birth, and some international and regional human rights bodies, as well as certain courts in some countries, try to convince that any prenatal protections must be consistent with women’s human rights and the powerful emerging trend to vitalize and extend a right to life before birth, and in particular from conception, poses a significant threat to women’s human rights, in theory and in practice. There is no issue in the need of consistence between the rights of prenatal normative protection of the fetus and women’s rights. In fact it is what should be. However, should the women’s rights are overestimated, to the total detriment and trespass of the rights, which are the legal refuge, the natural life potentiality can take shelter of, right here, the injustice and the crime begins.
The pivotal depth of the truth, some legal luminaries must be well gripped with is, there won’t be any life in the world, in the absence of the conceived fetus.
Even the woman, whose rights, the advocates of the abortion and the adherents of birth control polemics are attempting to defend are born in to this world, thanks to the life potentiality of the prenatal fetus. Therefore, the proclaimed thesis of the infraction of the rights of women, by the prenatal rights protection of the fetus depicts not only jurisprudential irrationality, but also a criminal mentality, embedded in sinfulness.
This is not to say that couple of debatable issues cannot be discovered in the fetus and women’s right dispute. Such contradiction can be successfully sorted out by means of striking a balance. The Good Governance Government should have the will and courage to strike the needed balance and unify the rights of both women and the life potential fetus. Then, it must also chase out the nation destroying NGOs from this country and save the nation from the death trap.
(b) These abortion and birth control proponents further lament that such efforts, often rooted in ideological and religious motivations, are part of a deliberate attempt to deny women the full range of reproductive health services that are essential to safeguarding women’s fundamental rights to life, health, dignity, equality, and autonomy, among others. The abortion and birth-control-supporting-theoreticians seem to equalize all religions, aligning them with the equilibration and absolutization.
The Buddha is the first religious teacher, who treasured women with absolute equality, respect, feminine dignity and their wellbeing.
Hence, the said theoretical yell of the denial of full-range reproductive health to women, declared to be rooted in ideological and religious motivations does not fit to the land of the Buddha. It may be appropriate to countries, wherein such transgressions of discriminations prevail. But not for Sri Lanka. Now, the Good Governance managers have a duty. That is, not to be victimized in to the irrationality of constitutional secularism, the Office of National Reconciliation is determined to constitutionalize and grant the Buddhism, the total constitutional protection so that the ecclesiastical foundation of the protection of women’s rights will be well set forth.
(C) The other argument, being brought forth is, these attempts, to grant a right to life before birth—and therefore recognize prenatal legal personhood—seek to bestow rights on a zygote, embryo, or fetus that would be equal or superior to the rights of women. Firstly, it linguistically is not very clear what they mean by legal personhood, whether it is living human-being or the entity of legal personality, legally incorporated as a commercial firm.
Secondly, if the legal personhood denotes the human-being, then rejection of the conceived fetus, which is the authentic foundation of the existential life of the woman, represents a totally unnecessary ontologico-jurisprudential dispute. The basic interpretational and terminological breach, the advocates of abortion and birth-control herein committing is, they psychologize the existential-naturality of the conceived life-potential fetus, as having no full-fledged life.
In short these jurisprudential experts of erudition consider, the absolute life potentiality of the fetus as death. The fundamental error of their misunderstood and misrepresented comprehension lies in that, they endeavour to determine the reality value of life with man-made law. Law is not the creator of life. It is life, which made the law. Life is above and beyond law. It cannot be defined by law only, since, life has a dimension above the law, though some aspects of life has to be governed by law. The essence of this beyond dimension is not yet known to us. Nevertheless, our ignorance of it cannot serve as the proof of its absence. Now, the only intelligent option left to man is, to accept this mysterious reality and protect the conceived fetus, to the best of man’s ability, unless and until it poses a threat to woman’s life. Thus, in view of the above, it is inevitable that the first operation of the Good Governance Government will be the chasing away of NGOs of vested interest, which conspire the nation-destroying abortions and forced birth control in this land of the Buddha.
(d) They expound further, “in many cases, these measures aim to outlaw any procedure that terminates a pregnancy”. The proponents are also troubled that these attempts have sought to justify restrictions on access to in-vitro fertilization and contraception. They also counter-argue that across the board, these strategies attempt to deny women the ability to make autonomous decisions regarding their fertility with complete disregard for women’s basic human rights.
Women are born in to this world, not to abuse their freedom and liberties, to sinfully kill their babies, by committing abortions and birth-control, unless such measures are commanded by the threat of death to mother and medically recommended for the wellbeing and health of the mother. Their God-gifted maternal duty is to conceive children, nourish children and continue reproduction. That is her natural right, the foundation of dignity and the depth of respect. Nevertheless, it is true that devastating and deceptive psychology propaganda is being launched to coax women in to so called freedom, and independence in order to drag them in to so-called decision-making autonomousness.
This propaganda proliferation has a selective modus operandi and is aimed basically at developing Asian countries. If a woman is inborn-barren, no sane-thinking person would oppose her in-vitro fertilization. If she is going to encounter medically unfavourable indisposition or infirmity on account of pregnancy, her compulsion in to child production is fraught with the possibility of prosecution. Therefore, the above arguments, being brought forth to promote abortion and birth-control would corroborate only one psychology-the vested interest, conspiracy and criminality.
The Government of Good Governance cannot be good, if it does not fight against vested interest, conspiracy and criminality, the ulterior motive of which is destruction of this nation, particularly, the Sinhala Buddhists and Hindu Tamils, since, the wonderful Muslim women are clever enough not to be trapped in to the heinous death trap of abortion and birth-control.
