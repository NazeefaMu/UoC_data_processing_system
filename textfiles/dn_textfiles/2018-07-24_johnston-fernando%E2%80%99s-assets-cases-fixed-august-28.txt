Johnston Fernando’s assets cases fixed for August 28

Colombo Chief Magistrate Ranga Dissanayake yesterday fixed the trials of three cases against former minister and Parliamentarian Johnston Fernando for his failure to disclose his annual assets and liabilities between 2010 and 2012, for August 28.
Bribery Commission Assistant Legal Director Ganga Heiyanthuduwa appeared on behalf of the Bribery Commission. President’s Counsel Kalinga Indratissa appeared on behalf of Fernando who pleaded not guilty to all the charges. When the first charge was read, Fernando stated that he had handed over his assets and liabilities report for 2010 to the former president.
He also stated that he had handed over his assets and liabilities report to the then President each year.
The Magistrate ordered the Bribery Commission officials to issue notice on the witnesses.
