Pethara irrigation anicut in disrepair

The Pethara irrigation anicut is in a state of disrepair.
The Thihagoda-Godamaga junction in Welletota via Malimbada main highway lies on this anicut.
According to motorists, the stretch of the highway at the junction is not even 10 feet wide and motorists find it difficult to drive heavy and long vehicles through it. This irrigation anicut was built over 60 to 70 years ago, across the Kiramba Oya, which is one of the main tributaries of the Nilwala river. The hairpin bend off this anicut is also a dangerous road block. Several accidents have occurred, residents said. The handrails of the anicut are broken down as well. To avoid further road accidents, residents urge the SPC road development authorities to construct a permanent bridge at this point of the road for the convenience of motorists and pedestrians. This is the only short route to the Godagama interchange of the southern expressway for commuters from down South, pedestrians said.
