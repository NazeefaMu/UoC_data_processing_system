To move heaven and earth

Head Prefect of Wesley College Joshua Siriwardena has many aspects of his life that work for him such as faith in his God, the people who have a positive impact on his life and faith in himself. Perfect Prefects features Siriwardena a leader who leads others with peace and purpose in his heart and mind.
“In times of adversity I read my favorite verse Psalm 121:1 -2 –“I look up to the mountains, does my help come from there? My helps comes from the lord who made the heavens and the earth.’
I always carry a key in my pocket, and I when I hold that key I realize that I have the key to my life. I am responsible for my success and failure. If I fail it is all my fault. I could have done better,” explained Siriwardena.
Real privilege
“In school I look up to my chaplain Rev. Obeth because he has a lot of experience and knows how to tackle each and every situation in the right way. Then there is our principal, Avanka Fernando, a great leader who knows how to tackle every situation in the right way. Being in touch with them and working with them gives me much wisdom. Seeing them tackle the situation makes me learn so much. It is a real privilege working with them.
When I am in real trouble then I pray. If it is a really tough problem I face, I would consult my mom. She is a very practical thinker. She knows how to get stuff done in the right manner.
To solve a problem I would stand by my ground. I listen to everyone and make sure I make the right decision. If I am not sure about the decision I would consult someone or pray about it. Whatever I decide I would stand by my ground. I will stand my ground and make sure the proper thing is done,” elucidated Siriwardena.
Wesley College has a long history and a proud culture.
“We all treat each other as brothers. We are all very united. No one leaves the school gates with an angry heart. There is a strong brotherly culture in Wesley. I thank Wesley for all I am.
Educational system
As a Head Prefect you have to play more of a brotherly role in Wesley College. Because that is the culture that has been passing on. Being a leader cannot be taught by any book or educational system. You need to get out there. It is more or less a practical lesson. You can’t read a book and learn leadership. The experiences you go through day by day is what makes you a good leader,” said Siriwardena.
Siriwardena has so many role models to look up to.
“I have had so many heroes that have impacted my life. My dad is my first hero. I guess every boys first hero is his dad! Then there is our Chaplain Bro. T.R. Obeth who has helped me grow spiritually and gave me a whole new perspective of life. Then another leader I look up to is Nelson Mandela. 27 years in prison. But he just forgave and gave love. That takes a lot of courage. He was a very strong leader,” stated Siriwardena.
Living in the moment is one message he gives to the youth.
“One message I wish to give the youth is to live in the moment. Live in the present moment. Do what you have to do at that time. If you are in the classroom then do your studies. If you are on the field then do your sports. Because these days unlike those days life is not a run anymore. It is a sprint. Life is like a Marathon and you got to sprint the whole marathon. I treasure each moment in life because I will never get it back again. There are ups and downs, and days I want to put behind me, but I gain an experience out of it. But one day that was really special for me was the day I was appointed senior prefect. Being appointed Senior Prefect happened so fast. My mom and dad were in tears that day. I consider that the happiest day of my life,” pointed out Siriwardena.
Another message he gives the youth is to correct their attitudes.
“I think the attitudes some people have make a huge difference in this world. You should be able to treat the janitor the same way you treat the CEO. I should be able to treat the Grade 1 student or the support staff the same way I treat the principal. This I say in terms of respect. I should be able to respect each and every one equally. When I respect you, you give me respect back.
Pride and ego
In order to change the world today what I feel is, you need to change the attitudes of the people. You should be down to earth. These days’ people have more pride and ego. I have the title of Senior Prefect and I can become arrogant about it. But that is not how it should work. I should be humble and treat everyone equally. I should be who I am after getting the title as well.
If we want to change the world then we have to change our attitudes and thinking patterns. In other countries you see young people working in Mcdonald’s and places like that. So the thinking pattern should be – ‘He is trying to lay his foundation in life. He is doing it part time to come up in life’. The attitude should not be to look down on jobs like that,” elucidated Siriwardena.
Wesley College is a special place for Siriwardena.
“I have been at Wesley from Grade 1 and all the other boys in the school get home by 2.30pm or 3.00pm. But Wesley College is nicest before 6.00am and after 6.00pm. That is the time you get to interact with nature a lot.
Also the Chapel is the most peaceful place I have ever been. Whenever I am in trouble or whenever I feel down, this is the place I come to. Before and after six it is really silent. The chapel is where I come to meditate and do my prayers and then I feel totally different. I am a person who has a lot of patience. I listen to what everyone says. Because they may be right at some point. When the work has piled up and I just feel like giving up, the chapel is where I come. This place is really magical to me. It takes the stress out of my head. It brings me back to a whole new level,” added Siriwardena.
Attention to discipline
A love and sense of gratitude towards his school are his guiding principles in life.
“In Wesley we give more attention to discipline. But we give ample opportunity for all students to excel in their talents and strengths. Being the Head Prefect of Wesley, I get the opportunity to represent the whole student body. So a Head Prefect should be able to treat everyone equally. His vision should be to uphold the school’s name in every possible way. He should be able to rally the other prefects to be able to work towards one goal and uphold the school’s name,” stressed Siriwardena.
As he said before strong and positive role models are what any young boy or girl needs.
“In any stage in a person’s life you need proper and strong role models or a something strong to believe in, otherwise your path starts to deviate. It is not your fault because you think you are doing the right thing. I feel that the youth need to use their time in a productive manner. Again I think the biggest problems in this world are due to the attitudes. Ego plays a huge role and having an ego will not get you very far. Not forgiving the other person and the ego are the main two causes for all the problems in society,” shared Siriwardena.
“I watch inspirational movies like ‘Invictus’ and the ‘Miracle’. I watch more or less motivational movies. It is not action movies as such, but if it is about a sport and motivation, then that would be my kind of movie. I even watch comedies. I am fond of Adam Sandler movies,” summed up Siriwardena.
