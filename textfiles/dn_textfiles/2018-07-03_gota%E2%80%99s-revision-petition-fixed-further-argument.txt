Avant-Garde corruption case
Gota’s revision petition fixed for further argument

A revision application filed by former Defence Secretary Gotabhaya Rajapaksa, seeking an order to stay the Colombo Chief Magistrate’s Court proceedings pertaining to Avant-Garde corruption case, was yesterday fixed for further argument on July 4 by the Court of Appeal.
The Bribery Commission had filed a corruption case against former Defence Secretary Gotabhaya Rajapaksa and seven others for allegedly causing a Rs.11.4 billion unlawful loss to the government when giving permission to Avant-Garde Maritime Services (Pvt) Ltd to operate a floating armoury.
When the matter came up before the two-judge-bench comprising Justice Achala Wengappuli and Justice Arjuna Obeysekara, President’s Counsel Romesh de Silva appearing for Gotabaya Rajapaksa made his oral submissions.
Silva submitted to Court that the Director General of the Bribery Commission had filed this case without the written sanction of the Bribery Commission.
Through this petition Gotabaya Rajapaksa is also challenging the Colombo Chief Magistrate’s decision to refuse preliminary objections raised by Gotabhaya Rajapaksa regarding the Avant-Garde corruption case.
In his revision petition, Gotabhaya Rajapaksa has challenged the Chief Magistrate’s decision to refuse preliminary objections raised by him and the Chief Magistrate’s decision to fix the matter for trial.
On a previous occasion, the Colombo High Court had also turned down a request made by Gotabhaya Rajapaksa and seven others that they be released from a corruption case filed by the Bribery Commission over the Avant-Garde incident.
Rajapaksa is also seeking an order to set-aside the Colombo High Court’s order dated February 2, 2018.
The Commission to Investigate Allegations of Bribery or Corruption had filed this case against eight accused including Gotabhaya Rajapaksa under Section 70 of the Bribery Act.
The Bribery Commission alleged that the accused had given permission to Avant-Garde Maritime Services (Pvt) Ltd to operate a floating armoury between August 7, 2012 and January 8, 2015 in violation of laws by providing unlawful income to this private company, amounting to Rs.11.4 billion.
President’s Counsel Romesh de Silva appeared for the petitioner.
Senior State Counsel Janaka Bandara appeared for the Bribery Commission.
