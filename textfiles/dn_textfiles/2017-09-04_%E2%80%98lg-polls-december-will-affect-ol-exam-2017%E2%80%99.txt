‘LG polls in December will affect O/L Exam 2017’

Commissioner General of Examinations W.M.N.J. Pushpakumara has requested Elections Commission not to hold Local Government (LG) elections on a day close to the O/L Examination–2017 as the exam is scheduled to be held early December.
The Commissioner has pointed out that the exam is to commence on December 12 and the coordinating offices will be opened on December 10 and many government schools will be examination centres.
If local government polls are conducted, possible post-election activities and violence may affect the exam procedures, he said.
The Election Commission is to hold the LG polls on December 9.
