Govt. will take action against offenders: Minister Ranatunga

Petroleum Resources Development Minister Arjuna Ranatunga stated that the President and the Prime Minister are ready to take action against offenders attached to the current government.
He said so during a meeting with employees of the Sapugaskanda oil refinery.
“I had a great desire to establish a consensus government. The SLFP harassed the UNP when the SLFP won and vice versa. I have experienced these harassments. But our government has altered this culture by turning to a new path. This year we had to pay the highest debt. We are trying our best to manage debt payments without burdening the people,” he said.
“Our government and the Cabinet have dedicated to solve the debt issue. The President and Prime Minister have led the country on a new path together with all political parties in the East and West without discriminating Sinhalese, Tamils or Muslims,” he added.
“I am disappointed about not punishing wrongdoers. However, the President and the Prime Minister are taking action against offenders attached to our government too,” Minister Ranatunga added. Several dignitaries including Petroleum Resources Development Deputy Minister Dr. Anoma Gamage and CPC Chairman Dammika Ranathunga also participated.
