Quest for fitness

Hula dancing is a popular style of dancing in the Hawaiian Islands
Why hula?
You lose calories while hula hooping, and thus you can maintain your weight within the normal range for your height.
The hula hoop is a piece of workout equipment that can tone your thighs, abdominals, gluteal, and arms
Hula hoop exercise routines offer several health benefits
You can start with the basic moves until you feel comfortable, then step up your game to more advanced ones, mixing and matching for your own personal head-to-toe tone-up.
A 2010 study by the American Council on Exercise found that hooping burns about 7 calories per minute, or about 210 calories during a 30-minute workout.
After a long day in front of a computer, hula-hooping offers a rejuvenating workout that can help you realign your spine
Hula hooping improves your blood circulation, the healing process, concentration, muscle tone, flexibility, coordination and dexterity significantly.
Those who don't have time to go to a gym due to a busy schedule can try this at home itself.
First two minutes with a simple side-to-side move.
To do this move, hold the hoop at your waist, and your feet a little wider than shoulder-width apart. Push the hoop from your hip to get it started, then spin your hips in a side-to-side motion to keep it going.
Start with one foot about two feet in front of the other. Hold the hoop at waist level and push it off your hips to get it started. Rock your hips forward and back, keeping your knees loose, to keep the hoop going. Try to continue this motion for two minutes
Next two minutes, Stand with your legs squeezed together and your knees slightly bent, with the hula hoop at your waist. Lean forward and push the hoop off so it starts to rotate. Lift your body up and down to keep the momentum of the hoop going, keeping the weight on your toes.
Final minute, spin the hoop around your hand vertically, moving your hand up and down to keep it going.
Keep the hoop going for a minute, then rest, and repeat!
