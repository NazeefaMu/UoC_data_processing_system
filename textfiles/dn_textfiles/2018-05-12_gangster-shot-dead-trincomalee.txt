Gangster shot dead in Trincomalee

Underworld gangster Hendavitharanage Selin Kumara alias Thel Kumara has been shot dead in Trincomalee yesterday morning.
Police said that three unidentified men who came in a car had shot him while he was on board a lorry opposite his house at Sirimapura in Trincomalee.
He died on admission to the Hospital. Kumara is a close associate of Ice Manju who had very close connections with the LTTE during the height of war.
Ice Manju has allegedly helped the LTTE to transport weapons and ammunition to Colombo. Ice Manju went missing with the end of the war in 2009.
