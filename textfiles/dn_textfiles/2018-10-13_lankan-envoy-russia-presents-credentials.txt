Lankan envoy to Russia presents credentials

Sri Lankan Ambassador in Russia Dayan Jayatilleka presented his credentials to Russian President Vladimir Putin at the Kremlin, yesterday.
He was accompanied by Russian Foreign Affairs Minister Sergey Lavrov and Foreign Policy Advisor to the Russian President Yury Ushakov.
President Putin outlined Russia’s position on key foreign policy developments, with an emphasis on defending the principles of the UN Charter of the sovereign equality of states, opposing intervention in the internal affairs of sovereign states and the domination of force and sanctions.
The President noted Russia’s interest in ensuring closer economic ties with Sri Lanka, particularly in agriculture, fisheries and tourism, adding that he wished to highlight the intergovernmental agreement on cooperation in the defence sphere, signed in September 2018.
Ambassador Jayatilleke and his wife Sanja later hosted a reception for the Embassy personnel along with Russian Foreign Ministry officials. In his address, he underscored the importance of his mission in Russia.
