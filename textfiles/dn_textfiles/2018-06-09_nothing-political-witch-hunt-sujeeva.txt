NO KNOWLEDGE OF MENDIS FUNDING POLLS CAMPAIGN :
Nothing but a political witch-hunt - Sujeeva

International Trade State Minister Sujeewa Senasinghe denied that he had any knowledge of Mendis Distilleries having donated for his election campaign or that it was a subsidiary of Perpetual Treasuries Ltd (PTL). The State Minister addressing a media briefing at his residence at Chelsea Gardens, Colpetty, said many had donated to his election fund run by close friends and that they did not keep track of donated funds.
The B report filed in Court on Thursday in the case connected to the Central Bank Bond issue stated that Senasinghe had received three cheques (one in August 2015, another in October 2015 and third April 2016) of Rs 1 million each from W. M. Mendis and Company, and that they were cashed by police officers attached to the his security detail.
The Minister who sat on the second COPE Committee which investigated into the Bond Issue in 2016 said that it was only when they were investigating into PTL that he figured that Mendis was a subsidiary of PTL.
He however refused to answer questions of whether at the time, he should have mentioned having received funds from Mendis and Company. “It was only last year that we got to know that PTL was involved in all this. We did not want to protect anyone. Even though they called us the ‘footnote gang’, we scientifically studied the issue and all our recommendations were legal, even the Bond Commission admitted that,” Senasinghe said.
He added that if he had known earlier, he would not have taken the money. “I was just in the wrong place at the wrong time”.
Senasinghe also said it was unfair that his name was mentioned in the B report when thousands of those who had been paid by Mendis did not have their name on the report, “The B report clearly states that I have not committed a crime. So why is my name there? What about the suppliers, media and other people Mendis would have given money to?”, he asked.
Over Rs 300 million is being spent on this investigation with around 70 CID officers investigating. “This is nothing but a political witch-hunt. What about the other crimes that need to be investigated,” he said.
The State Minister added that if anyone was to make a genuine request, he was prepared to give back the Rs 3 million.
“I cannot speak too much on this.The Speaker told me to make a short statement, there is an issue of privilege here. Legally you cannot release the names of the MPs if they have not committed a crime. The Speaker is looking into this,” Senasinghe said.
