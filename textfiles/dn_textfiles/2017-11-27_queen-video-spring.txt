CEO of YouTube, Susan Wojcicki
Queen of the video spring

Being a leading personality in the tech industry, Susan Wojcicki has her own share of experiences when it comes to being subtly but firmly discouraged in her job simply because she was a woman.
“I’ve had my abilities and commitment to my job questioned. I’ve been left out of key industry events and social gatherings. I’ve had meetings with external leaders where they primarily addressed the more junior male colleagues. I’ve had my comments frequently interrupted and my ideas ignored until they were rephrased by men. No matter how often this all happened, it still hurt,” she writes to fortune.com, in response to a now-infamous internal memo that was recently released ‘Google’s Ideological Echo Chamber.’
The memo, which caused quite a stir in social media, was written by US-based Google engineer James Damore about Google’s diversity policies and suggested that “the distribution of preferences and abilities of men and women differ in part due to biological causes and that these differences may explain why we don’t see equal representation of women in tech and leadership.”
The ideas portrayed did not fail to hurt the feelings of women like Wojcicki,who is constantly heard speaking for women, encouraging more females to take up jobs in the tech field, motivating more women to make their way to the upper layers of the leadership hierarchy.
Wojcicki, while treading her own path of success, is on her mission to encourage more young women to work in technology because if they did not own the opportunities and retreated in the race in the tech field, women are at risk of losing out on tomorrow’s best job opportunities.
Google in the garage
In September 1998, the same month that Google was incorporated, its founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin set up office in Wojcicki’s garage in Menlo Park, California. Before becoming Google’s first marketing manager in 1999, Wojcicki worked in marketing at Intel in Santa Clara, California and was a management consultant at Bain & Company and R.B. Webber & Company.
Wojcicki grew within Google to become Senior Vice President of Advertising and Commerce and lead the advertising and analytic products including AdWords, AdSense, and DoubleClick.
Working with YouTube
Two students, in their dorm room, singing to the Backstreet Boys. And their roommate is in the background, doing his homework. This simple, funny moment, captured in a short video was YouTube’s first big hit when the site was just starting out. “I realized, in that moment, that anybody can be a creator,” said Wojcicki to Vanity Fair.
And there are so many people out there who have a story, or a vision or something that they want to communicate with the world, she said. “It was a big leap of faith, and there were a lot of things for us to work through but that video alone, made me realize that YouTube is going to be really big.” YouTube, a small start-up at first, was successfully competing with Google’s Google Video service overseen by Wojcicki. Her response was to propose the purchase of YouTube. She handled two of Google’s largest acquisitions: the $1.65 billion purchase of YouTube in 2006 and the $3.1 billion purchase of DoubleClick in 2007. And in February 2014 she became the CEO of YouTube.
Reputation
In the year 2013, Wojcicki grabbed the first position on the Adweek 50 list. In the year 2015, Vanity Fair’s New Establishment gave her the 27th rank that is quite commendable.She made it to the top 100 most influential people in 2015, which was one of her greatest achievements. She was also described as the most powerful woman on the Internet. Forbes also gave her the nineth place in the list of Power Women and the 46th place amidst America’s Self-Made Women. These ranks speak of the success and power Wojcicki holds as a one of the smartest minds in tech field.
Family and education
Wojcicki was born on July 5, 1968. She grew up on the Stanford campus, with American mathematical scientist George Dantzig as a neighbour. She attended Gunn High School in Palo Alto, California, and wrote for the school newspaper.
Wojcicki studied history and literature at Harvard University and graduated with honours in 1990. She originally planned on getting a PhD in Economics and pursuing a career in academia, but changed her plans when she discovered technology.
She also received her Masters of Science in Economics from the University of California, Santa Cruz in 1993 and a Master’s in Business Administration from the UCLA Anderson School of Management in 1998.
She is the daughter of Esther Wojcicki, an educator of Russian Jewish descent, and Stanley Wojcicki, a Polish American physics professor at Stanford University. She has two sisters: Janet Wojcicki and Anne Wojcicki.
Work-life balance
Wojcicki is said to have a strict separation of work and personal life: “She and her husband, also a Google executive, make it home for dinner with their five children almost every single night,” reports journalist Matt Weinberger of Insider.com. “Success is not based on the number of hours that you’ve worked,” Wojcicki said in an interview with the site. “If you are working 24/7, you’re not going to have any interesting ideas.”
Work-life balance was cited by the Industry Gender Gap report as a “leading barrier to attracting and retaining women in the tech industry,” and something that needs to be critically improved.
Empowering ads on YouTube
She speaks of allowing empowering ads on YouTube: “In the recent past, women in commercials were portrayed as either, mothers or models, wives or waitresses, with few depictions of the diverse lives we could lead outside of our relationships to men or children. If we weren’t arm candy, we were eye candy, as scantily clad women promoted everything from beer to cheeseburgers to gym memberships,” she writes on thinkwithgoogle.com.
But recently, some advertisers have portrayed women in a different light. And by encouraging such ads on her website, Wojcicki intends to empower women as “These video ads don’t just generate impressions, they leave impressions.”
From her own daughter to thousands of young women who misjudge their own abilities, Wojcicki is forever in a serious endeavor to call them home, call them into the world of fast advancing technology and inspire them to be passionate about what they can win the future with.
At a net worth of $410 million, compelo.com says she’s “the queen of Silicon Valley”, but it is evident that she doesn’t intend to lead the race on her own. For, in the end, what it comes down to is not the so-called ‘biological causes,’ but one’s own courage and one’s own will.
