Fulfilling prawn crazy cravings

Since opening up their doors to prawn lovers last year, ISSO has left its mark as a favourite go-to quick service restaurant in Colombo. Conveniently located down Sulaiman Terrace off Jawatta Road, this year, the restaurant celebrates its first anniversary in business. Their success as one of the most talked-about food joints is vastly owing to their unique menu offering which consists of all things prawn and is an ideal pick for those looking to indulge in mouthwatering prawn dishes.
Another aspect that adds to the uniqueness of ISSO is the option they offer its visitors to customize their order. Visitors can select the size and style of their dishes, and pick the carb of their preference to complete the combo. Additionally, each combo is also served with a complimentary salad to go on the side.
“When we started ISSO last year, what we wanted was to offer a novel food experience to our customers; and ISSO being a prawn-centric restaurant was a first in Sri Lanka. We also wanted to make our menu intriguing by letting our customers choose their own combinations for their meals. So we came up with a few interesting variations under the size, style and carb options, allowing our customers have access to a wide number of combos which they can customize. Through this we have been able to tap into different palettes with a variety of cuisines successfully,” Co-Founders of ISSO Apinash Sivagumaaran, Fawaz Fassi and Shuaib Yusoof said.
“During the past year we have been able to progressively grow, improve and strengthen our relationships with our customers. I think it’s safe to say, we are happy with how far we have come. Going forward we want to introduce a menu that has been inspired by different cuisines to give our customers a taste of prawn dishes from all over the world, be it Sri Lankan, Italian, Japanese, Indian and so on” they added.
The restaurant is also famed for its reinventions of traditional Sri Lankan foods such as the beloved local street food Isso Waday and the Jaffna Prawn Curry. ISSO’s Sweet Potato Fries, which took Colombo by storm when introduced is its most popular side option.
ISSO, which has been ranked among the top 5 restaurants in Colombo for 2017 by TripAdvisor, prides itself on the quality of its food. The ingredients that are used to prepare the food are carefully selected and the prawns, which are only of export quality, are guaranteed to be fresh, succulent and appealing to taste buds.
The outlet ambience is ideal to grab a quick meal with friends or family, with both indoor and outdoor seating. Customers also have the convenience of a take-out option and ISSO also offers free delivery within Colombo city limits.
