Palace phantoms

A palace used by Sweden's royal family is haunted, according to Queen Silvia. But the queen says there is nothing to be afraid of as the phantoms at their private residence Drottningholm Palace are "pretty friendly".
Silvia told a TV documentary that "there are ghosts, many" and says, "you feel you get a little excited" when talking about them.
She added: "You sometimes feel that you're not completely alone. It's really exciting but you don't get scared."
The palace, originally built in the 16th century, is located near Stockholm and is the permanent residence of Queen Silvia and her husband King Carl XVI Gustaf.
The palace is listed on the UNESCO world heritage list and has been the royal family's residence since 1981.
Aged 73, Queen Silvia married King Carl 40 years ago after they met at the 1972 Olympic Games in Munich and is Sweden's longest-serving queen.
Just before Christmas she was taken to hospital after feeling dizzy but was discharged a few days later. The royal family's role is largely ceremonial but they are hugely popular with the public.
