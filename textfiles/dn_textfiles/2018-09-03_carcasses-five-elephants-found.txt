Carcasses of five elephants found

Five decomposed carcasses of wild elephants lying in a marshy field in Onegama in Polonnaruwa were found by Wildlife officials yesterday.
Wildlife officials believe that the four jumbos in the Somawathiya National Park may have got bogged down in the marsh, while roaming the nearby fields in search of food and water. Officials said they had recently recovered the carcass of an elephant calf lying in marshy land in the area.
