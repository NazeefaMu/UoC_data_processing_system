The Petitioner states that the SLSFTA shall have a direct and adverse impact on the Public Finance of Sri Lanka and therefore requires the prior sanction and approval of the Parliament pertaining to the scope and mandate of negotiations, signing and implementation of the SLSFTA. However, in the absence of such approval the SLSFTA is lacking of constitutional mandate and therefore illegal and null and void.
The petitioner maintained that the executive actions relating to the commencement of negotiations, signing and implementation of SLSFTA shall violate Articles 148 and 157 of the Constitution and also amounting to alienation of the Legislative powers of the Parliament.
President’s Counsel Manohara de Silva, Ali Sabry PC, Sanjeewa JAyawardane with Senior Counsel Kanishka Vitharana appeared for the petitioners.
