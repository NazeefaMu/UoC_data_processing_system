NPHCTF to highlight Hill Country Tamils’ grievances

An organization by the name of Northern Province Malayaha Makkal Onriyam or Northern Province Hill Country Tamil Forum (NPHCTF), has been formed to represent the grievances of the Hill Country Tamils who are living in the Northern Province.
The Organization formed last week met Northern Province Chief Minister, C.V. Vigneswaran and submitted a memorandum to him, highlighting the issues Hill Country Tamils have faced since settling in the North after the ethnic riots in 1958, 1977, 1981 and 1983.
According to the Director of the Institute of Social Development, P. Muthulingam who led the delegation together with former Northern Provincial Council Member M.P. Nadaraja, the Chief Minister welcomed the idea of forming an organisation to represent the issues of the marginalised hill country Tamils who live in the Northern Province and regretted to hear the problems faced by the Malayaha Makkal in the Northern Province. Further he assured to take action to address the issues of the Malayaha Community.
The Hill Country Tamils at present reside in 40 Grama Niladhari divisions in the Kilinochchi district, 86 Grama Niladhari divisions in the Vavuniya district and 38 Grama Niladhari divisions in the Mullaitivu district; overall they consist of 40 percent of the Northern Province. But, the NPHCTF alleges that though the Hill Country Tamils became part and parcel of the 30 year war, “soon after the war, some initiations were taken to provide infrastructure development by the government and provincial council but the said attempts excluded the Hill Country Tamils who lived in the Northern Province.
Hence, the Hill Country Tamils live in the area with their distinguished cultural identity. The native Tamils also look at them as a distinguished separate Tamil community.”
In terms of livelihood, they point out that the Hill Country Tamils were settled in the upper part of the lakes and tanks and are not in a position to engage in agriculture due to the unavailability of water, “This made them rely on others for agriculture or work as daily labourers in their lands. As a result, the community is unable to engage in agricultural activities which is their main livelihood. This resulted in them having no opportunity to increase their income,” Muthulingam said.
Similar problems also exist in the areas of housing, education, political representation, employment and infrastructure development; where the NPHCTF feel that the Hill Country Tamils have been discriminated and dealt with a poor hand.
They have thus requested the “Provincial and National authorities to identify and address the development needs of the Hill Country Tamils to ensure their inclusion as a focus group in divisional development plans.”
