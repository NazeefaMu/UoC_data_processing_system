‘Govt. should provide allowance to flood-stricken tea smallholders’

Since tea cultivation in the south were devastated by recent floods, the government should provide allowance to tea smallholders until they start replanting and earn an income, said Tea Small Holders National Congress Organiser Lal Premanath.
He said so addressing a meeting held at Morawaka on June 19. Premanath said nearly 9,800 tea smallholdings were destroyed and the estimated damage is more than Rs. 600 million. This would be an adverse impact on the economy which will be seriously felt in another few months rather than immediately. It would take atleast three years for smallholders to reap the crop and earn an income from their replanted plots.
Premanath said, the government needs not incur an additional expenditure to assist affected tea smallholders because it could rely on the Cess fund which had reached over USD 60 million, rather than retaining it in the consolidated fund.
