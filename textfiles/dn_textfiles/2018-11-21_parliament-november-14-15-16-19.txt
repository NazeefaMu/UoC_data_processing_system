Parliament descended into unprecedented chaos in its history on November 14, 15 and 16 as Speaker Karu Jayasuriya entered the Chambers with dozens of Police officers and Parliamentary staff. The lawmakers met again on November 19 in Parliament after this incident under Deputy Speaker Ananda Kumarasiri, who presided over the sessions of the House and the assembly was peaceful. It proceeded calmly without any disruptions and the members dispersed peacefully after meeting for seven minutes.
