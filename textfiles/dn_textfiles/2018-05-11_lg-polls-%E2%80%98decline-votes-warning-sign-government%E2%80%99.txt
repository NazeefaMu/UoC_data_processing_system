LG polls: ‘Decline in votes, a warning sign for government’

The decline in votes for the Good Governance Government during the recent Local Government (LG) elections, was a warning sign from the people of the country, Anuradhapura District United National Party (UNP) Parliamentarian Ishak Rahuman said.
"Voters had given a warning signal to the UNP as well as the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) at the last election. If we fail to learn a lesson from that, they will send us home at the next election," MP Rahuman added.
He was addressing a meeting to mark the inauguration of the rehabilitation work on the Katukeliyawa Muslim Primary School playground, yesterday.
Rahuman said people voted the Yahapalanaya Government into power with faith and expectations. The President, Prime Minister and other ministers and parliamentarians alleged that some of their own party members were preventing them from performing a service to the people. Sixteen members who resorted to that tactic had now, left the government.
Rahuman said he would make one request from President Maithripala Sirisena: to develop schools and roads in the Anuradhapura district with equal emphasis as he gave the Polonnaruwa district, since he was considered the undisputed leader of Rajarata.
He said the government had another two years to complete its tenure; “We could march forward and win the next election too, if we act fast to fulfil the election pledges held out to the people during the balance term.”
