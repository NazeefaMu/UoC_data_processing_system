Ayurveda doctor and Asst Legal Officer arrested

An Ayurvedic doctor and an Assistant Legal Officer in the Ayurveda Department were arrested by the officers of the Bribery Commission yesterday when they were soliciting a bribe to renew the Annual License of an Ayurdevic Drugs Manufacturing Centre in Danowita.
Speaking to the Daily News, Commission to Investigate Allegations of Bribery or Corruption (CIABOC) Director SSP Priyantha Chandrasiri said the two suspects were arrested while obtaining Rs 50,000 as an advance of a bribe of Rs 250,000.
He said they have initially solicited a bribe of Rs 300,000 to get the annual license for 2018 approved by the Committee set up in the Department, but had later negotiated to reduce it to Rs. 250,000.
The raid was carried out around 3.45 pm at the Ayurdeva Department. He said the two suspects would be produced before the Colombo Magistrate today.
