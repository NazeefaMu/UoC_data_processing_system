US, allies expel Russian envoys over spy attack

FRANCE: The United States and its European allies on Monday expelled scores of Russian diplomats in a coordinated action against Moscow which they accuse of poisoning an ex-spy in Britain.
The United States expelled 60 alleged “spies” posted around the country and at the Russian mission to the United Nations.
It also closed the Russian consulate in Seattle over alleged spying at the nearby Kitsap submarine base and Boeing.
The retaliation against Moscow was taken “in response to Russia's use of a military-grade chemical weapon on the soil of the United Kingdom,” White House press secretary Sarah Sanders said.
Canada ousted four diplomats, calling the nerve agent attack “a despicable, heinous and reckless act”. Australia followed suit with Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull saying two Russian diplomats had seven days to leave.
Sixteen EU states have joined Britain in expelling Russian diplomats following a European Council decision last week to react to Moscow within a common framework.
“Additional measures including further expulsions are not to be excluded in the coming days and weeks,” EU President Donald Tusk said. Britain itself has already kicked out 23 Russian diplomats, with Moscow retaliating with a tit-for-tat move.
Croatia: One diplomat Czech Republic: Three diplomats Denmark: Two diplomats Estonia: One diplomat France: Four diplomats Finland: One diplomat Germany: Four diplomats Hungary: One diplomat Italy: Two diplomats Latvia: One diplomat Lithuania: Three diplomats Netherlands: Two diplomats Norway: One diplomat Poland: Four diplomats Romania: One diplomat Spain: Two diplomats Sweden: One diplomat
Two diplomats Macedonia: One diplomat Norway: One diplomat Ukraine: 13 diplomats President Petro Poroshenko called for even more action to be taken.
“The next step is to increase the price that Moscow has to pay for its international crimes, including the strengthening of personal, financial and economic sanctions,” he said. Meanwhile, true to President Donald Trump's embrace of superlatives, that was the largest single expulsion of Russians or Soviet intelligence officers on record, according to one senior official.
Trump also ordered the closure of the Russian consulate in Seattle -- within snooping distance of a US submarine base and a plant run by aircraft-maker Boeing, one of the president's favored companies.
Trump's aides, aware that Americans think he and Putin are too cozy, stressed the expulsions were the President's decision. It seemed like, as with US Presidents past, the scales may be falling from Trump's eyes when it comes to the former KGB officer who now runs Russia. - AFP
