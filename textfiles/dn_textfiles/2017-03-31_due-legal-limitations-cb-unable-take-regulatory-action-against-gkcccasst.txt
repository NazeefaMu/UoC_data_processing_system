Due to legal limitations CB unable to take regulatory action against GKCCC:Asst. Governor

Assistant Governor Sepala Ratnayake yesterday, said there were legal limitations due to which the Central Bank was unable to take regulatory action against the Golden Key Credit Card Company (GKCCC).
Ratnayake was the Director of the Non Bank Financial Institute, which was responsible in supervising the scandal-hit Golden Key Credit Card Company.
The Golden Key collapsed during year 2007-2008.
Ratnayake said, since there were legal limitations, they had to take measures to improve public awareness on the matter.
He was questioned on matters concerning his term of office as the Director of NBFI, by Supreme Court Justice P. Jayawardane yesterday, at the Presidential Commission inquiring into the Treasury Bond issue.
