Vaiko arrested while attempting to besiege Lankan embassy

MDMK General Secretary Vaiko and his followers along with traders union leader T. Vellaiyan were arrested on Saturday when they attempted to besiege the Deputy High Commission of Sri Lanka opposing a resolution in the UN Human Rights Council seeking more time for Sri Lanka to probe the war crimes during the military offensive in 2009. Addressing the protesters, Vaiko said the United States would bring a resolution giving two more years for Sri Lanka to hold an inquiry into the war crimes and the resolution also says that no international jurists could enter Sri Lanka without the latter’s consent.
The new resolution will bury justice for Tamils at the United Nations since a resolution asking Lanka to carry out an international, independent investigation was passed in the UNHRC in 2015, Vaiko said.
