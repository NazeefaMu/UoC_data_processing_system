AMG partners CMSC in first ‘Karting SLALOM’ in Sri Lanka

Once again the Ceylon Motor Sports Club (CMSC) introduces another brand new art of Motor Sport in Sri Lanka, by promoting the newly invented art of motor sport named as ‘Karting Slalom’. This art of motor sport was first initially the brainchild of the world governing body of motor sport, the FIA, and the Ceylon Motor Sports Club was chosen as the FIA’s Affiliate club to conduct a pilot project.
This is the first of its kind, whereby the FIA are looking at new innovative ways to promote grass roots level motor sport, which also covers areas of safe driving. Karting Slalom is mainly for children between the ages of 8 and 16 years, and provides and insight into how kids can get into motor sport at a young age.
The CMSC will provide two brand new Birel go karts and will get competitors to drive of a course, which will consist of many obstacles. The speed of the karts along the course will be almost at walking pace, whereby the competitors will have to ensure that they complete the course, by dislodging the least amount of cones in the process.
The CMSC will be using state of the art TAG Timing equipment and competitors will be give two heats, while the accumulated times will be recorded to adjudge the winner.
The first event will be conducted at the DIMO 800 (Mercedes Benz) facility in Peliyagoda, while students of S. Thomas College Motor Club will be taking part in this historic event.
Members, and friends of the CMSC, STC and Dimo are invited to witness this event which will commence at 7.30am on February 5.
