Job Fair in Puttalam District

"The President's and the Prime Minister's vision about the career opportunities for 10 lakhs youth is becoming a success step by step. As the second step of this, many Employment Organizations are to be constructed in Hambantota, by early 2018" said MP and Deputy Leader of ACMC M. H. M. Navavi.
He made this statement while addressing the Job Fair, which had been organized by the District Secretariat under the guidance of the Parliamentarian, on November 1 morning at Puttalam District Secretariat auditorium. The Parliamentarian attended as the Chief Guest of this event.
The event had a massive participation including Puttalam District Assistant Secretary E. A. T. M. Athukorala, Puttalam Assistant Divisional Secretary Sampath Weerasekara, Puttalam District Career Guidance Officer Sujeewa Manjanayaka, the ACMC Youth Organizer Iflal Ameen, other high officials, and many Youth from Puttalam and Vanathavillu divisions.
"Nowadays many of us expect government jobs and teaching. But we hesitate to enter into the job opportunities that are available in the private sectors. But now, private sectors provide many offers than the government. Also in the private sectors, we can get a vast knowledge and experience. Therefore, the youth should come forward to seek job opportunities in the private sectors too" Navavi said.
"The Chinese, Indians and Pakistanis have understood the value of Sri Lanka and they have come here to do a job. But our Sri Lankans fly to the countries like Saudi Arabia, Italy, for just Rs. 50,000 and Rs. 75,000. Rather than travelling far away from our home country, we can work in the private sectors, may be in a different town but inside our Motherland," the Parliamentarian added.
