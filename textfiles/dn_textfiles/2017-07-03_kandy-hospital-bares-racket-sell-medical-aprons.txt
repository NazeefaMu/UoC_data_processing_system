Kandy Hospital bares racket to sell medical aprons

The Kandy hospital authorities have launched an internal investigation to identify those behind an attempt to smuggle medical aprons worth Rs.1.5 million out of the hospital.
Following information, hospital authorities had found a stock of medical aprons which had been inside a lorry at the hospital premises.
The stock was to be sold to a private hospital, preliminary inquiries have revealed.
Authorities suspect that the racket of smuggling goods out of the hospital and selling them to private buyers is a practice going on for some time.
In connection with the incident hospital authorities have so far transferred a nurse from the unit.
Hospital sources say that authorities are dragging their feet in relation to the investigation and those responsible for smuggling hospital goods are still in the open.
