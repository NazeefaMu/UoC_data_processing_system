Candidates can now take  their IELTS on computer

The British Council in Sri Lanka has announced that IELTS candidates in the country, registered through the British Council, can take the globally recognised English proficiency test on a computer.
At an event held at the British Council Colombo recently, guests and members of the press were introduced to the operations and benefits of this novel test-taking experience, one that is certain to bring greater ease and flexibility to test-takers in the country.
The computer based alternative offers more test sessions a week, allowing candidates greater flexibility in scheduling their assessment dates in comparison to the fixed calendar schedule of the paper-based format. Candidates will also be able to receive their test results sooner -in 5 days as opposed to the 13-day waiting period of the alternative system.
“We are consistently dedicated to improving the IELTS test-taking system and experience,” said Gill Caldicott, Country Director of the British Council in Sri Lanka, commenting at the event on this new step forward. “IELTS on a computer is significantly beneficial in more ways than one, offering candidates greater flexibility and convenience.”
The new computer delivered format, allows candidates to take the Listening, Reading, and Writing sections of the examination on a computer, while the Speaking test will remain face-to-face. While the first three sections have to be completed on the same day, the latter can be taken up to a week either before or after the other sections have been completed. It is important to note however, that the test content, scoring, timing, and level of difficulty, will remain the same irrespective of the mode in which they are taken.
“IELTS on computer is not intended to replace the paper-based system, but will serve only to provide more options to candidates,” added British Council Sri Lanka Country Examinations Director, Rob Low. “Rest assured, candidates choosing this new computer delivered alternative will be taking the same trusted English language test, with the same security arrangements as with the paper delivered option.”
IELTS is one of the world’s most popular English language tests for higher education and migration, with over three million tests taken in the past year alone. Recognised by over 10,000 educational institutions, employers, and immigration bodies worldwide, in Sri Lanka it is more popularly taken by those who wishing to pursue migration, education, and employment options abroad.
