Shed political differences and help Meethotamulla victims: Asgiriya prelate

It is important on the part of all to set aside political animosity and differences and join hands in providing relief to the people affected by the Meethotamulla tragedy, said most Ven. Warakagoda Gnanarathane Mahanayaka Thera of the Asgiriya Chapter.
The need of the hour was assistance towards the affected people and the government should take measures to provide immediate relief to them, he said.
The prelate expressed these sentiments delivering an amassing when Jathika Hela Urumaya’s organiser for the Maharagama electorate Asanga Jayaratne called on him at his temple in Kandy and received his blessings yesterday.
The prelate said he observed Minister Patali Champika Ranawaka working with great dedication to promote development in the country. He said a majority of Buddhists today seemed to offer pride of place to Amisa (material) pooja over Prathipaththi (principles) pooja nowadays and certain anti-Buddhist forces were still active in the country.
Asanga Jayaratne said if politicians used the Meethotamulla tragedy to blame each other, the real victims of the tragedy would not gain any benefits.
