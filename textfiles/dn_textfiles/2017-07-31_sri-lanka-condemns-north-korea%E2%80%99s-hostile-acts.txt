Sri Lanka condemns North Korea’s hostile acts

The Government of Sri Lanka condemns the firing of a ballistic missile of intercontinental range by the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea (DPRK) on July 28, and the series of recent similar hostile acts by the DPRK in violation of the UN Security Council Resolutions, the Foreign Affairs Ministry said.
Issuing a statement, the ministry said, DPRK’s continued pursuit of nuclear and ballistic missile programmes and proliferation related activity pose a significant threat to international peace and security.
“In the interest of peace and security of all concerned, we urge the DPRK to refrain from such hostile acts and programmes in violation of UN Security Council Resolutions, which impact adversely on the stability of the region and beyond.
“The international community must unite in words and deeds to seek solutions to this grave situation which is an ever increasing threat to international peace and security,” the statement said.
