Govt. must take over SAITM: GMOA

The government must take over SAITM, not only the Dr. Neville Fernando Teaching Hospital, Government Medical Officers' Association (GMOA) Secretary Dr. Navin de Zoysa said.
Addressing the media at the GMOA Headquarters in Colombo yesterday, he said the GMOA will not let the government make SAITM function as a private company. The GMOA does not agree to let a private company use a state body which runs with public funds. According to Dr. Zoysa, a statement issued by the Higher Education Ministry on April 7, has reassured the facts presented by the GMOA. The statement said so called MBBS degree holders from SAITM do not have competence to obtain registration from the Sri Lanka Medical Council (SLMC). That is why clinical training and examination have been proposed for them by the Higher Education Ministry, he said.
Dr. Zoysa said SAITM has failed to manage its hospital as a teaching hospital. The Higher Education Ministry propose to take it over and fulfill its shortcomings. The Attorney General's Department should rectify the wrong details it presented to the Court of Appeal, he said. The GMOA Secretary said the pressure put on the Sri Lanka Medical Council (SLMC) by politicians should be defeated by uniting professionals in Sri Lanka. The SLMC is an independent body established by the Act number 40 of 1988. The Ceylon Medical Council (CMC) was established by the Medical Council ordinance number 24 of 1924, he said.
