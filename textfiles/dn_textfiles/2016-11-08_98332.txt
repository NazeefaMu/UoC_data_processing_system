Is Anushka Sharma the new Kareena Kapoor?

With Kareena Kapoor Khan on maternity leave, has showbiz found a worthy successor in Anushka Sharma? Indicators from her career certainly indicate that. Anushka has found her definite space on top of the marquee. She’s making a name in big budget films with big ticket superstars like Salman Khan, Shah Rukh Khan and even when she pairs with the new crop, like Ranbir Kapoor or Ranveer Singh, she goes home with hosannas.
Anushka’s career catapulted into the big league when her film with Shah Rukh Khan and Katrina Kaif, Yash Chopra’s ‘Jab Tak Hai Jaan’ became one of the biggest hits of 2012. In 2014, her much hyped film with Aamir Khan, ‘PK’, shattered every known box office record in India as well as overseas. And now 2016 has proved to be even more bountiful as Anushka’s big releases, ‘Sultan’ with Salman Khan and ‘Ae Dil Hai Mushkil’ with Ranbir Kapoor and Aishwarya Rai Bachchan have fast tracked to box office success. Sample this, ‘Jab Tak Hai Jaan’ box-office - 120 crores, ‘PK’ box-office - 340 crores, ‘Sultan’ box-office - 300 crores. ‘Ae Dil Hai Mushki’l has managed a respectable 66.8 crores in five days too. This is very reminiscent of Kareena Kapoor’s career design too. Filmfare
