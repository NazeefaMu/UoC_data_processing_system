Air Force - Navy a close tussle

The game between Air Force Sports Club and Navy Sports Club will be a closely fought out battle for supremacy at Air Force grounds in Rathmalana today in their Dialog ‘A’ Division inter club league rugby tournament. The match will commence at 4:00pm.
The Navy Sports club has failed to live up to expectations losing (19-26) to Havelock’s at Havelock Park last week.
The Airmen who have faced an unexpected plight losing some of their key players due to injuries are bound to field a couple of sidelined big names for today’s game. However adding to the woes would be the absence of their play maker and scrum half Ashok Wijeykumar from today’s game as he is touring with the Sri Lanka national under 19 team to take part in the Junior Rugby Asiad in Malaysia to be held from December 11-17. On the other hand Air Force who has won their outings against Police (22-12), CH and FC (26-12) and Army SC (32-29) last week after beating the mighty Kandy SC by 24-21 in the season’s second match is going all out to pull this one through with a victory.
Navy SC boasts of having in their ranks quality talented players in the form of Dulanjana Wijesinghe, Lee Keegal, Richie Darmapala and Chanaka Chandimal who are playing key roles for the sailors. Then comes the granite forward Danushka Perera ‘Gertha’ and players in the caliber of Sathya Ranathunga, Supun Peiris, skipper Gayantha Iddamalgoda and ever reliable full back in Thilina Weerasinghe.
Navy skipper and prop forward Roshan Ranasinghe faces another acid test after losing to Havelock’s (19-26) last week while the Air Force skipper Gayantha Iddamalgoda has fared admirably with the resurgent force by pulling off a superb (32-29) win over formidable Army SC last week.
