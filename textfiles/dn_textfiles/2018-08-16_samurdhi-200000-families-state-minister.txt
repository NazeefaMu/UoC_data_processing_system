Samurdhi for 200,000 families - State Minister

The government will grant Samurdhi relief to 200,000 families by the end of this year, Home Affairs State Minister J.C.Alawathuwala said.
Addressing the media at Sirikotha yesterday, the State Minister said the government had already identified around 500,000 low-income families who had not received Samurdhi benefits due to various reasons.
Initially, 200,000 such families will be provided with Samurdhi dividends by the end of this year. Within three years, the present government has been able to commence a large number of development projects in the country and some of these projects scheduled to be vested with the public within next few weeks to mark the third anniversary of the present government under the theme of “Husma Gaththa Wasara Thunak”.
“A massive development drive in the country is moving ahead and the government plans to start a large number of development projects under the ‘Gamperaliya’ covering all 25 districts of the country within next 15 months,” he said.
Alawathuwala said that the economy had suffered as a result of a debt crisis. But the present government focused on improving the economy through various projects and now the economy has become stable and the country is moving forward.
He said the construction activities of Kurunegala expressway are scheduled to be completed by 2020.
