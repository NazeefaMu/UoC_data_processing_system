Day of the Dead!

Throughout history, cultures across the globe have adopted creative ways to deal with death. In ancient China, they crafted funerary sculptures. During the Dutch Golden Age, artists touched on mortality in their still-life paintings. And, in modern Mexico, people celebrate Día de los Muertos, a colorful holiday dedicated to the dearly departed.
Though this festival has evolved over centuries, it remains one of Mexico’s most important events.
