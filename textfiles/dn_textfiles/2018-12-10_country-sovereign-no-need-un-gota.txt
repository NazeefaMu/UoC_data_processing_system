Country sovereign,  no need of UN - Gota

Former Defence Secretary Gotabhaya Rajapaksa rejected the need for United Nations security for the North as the local Forces are strong and capable to protect the country.
Rajapaksa was speaking to the media at the Abhayarama temple in Narahenpita last evening. He was questioned by journalists on the Global Tamil Diaspora’s purported request from the United Nations for security to the North, considering the prevailing political instability. “We can deal with such matters with our militaries,” he said.
He said international powers cannot influence Sri Lanka on political matters as a sovereign country.
The prevailing political crisis came up as a result of international involvement during some regimes, he said.
The former Defence Secretary also criticised the UNF government for not having enough understanding regarding national security.
Incidents like the recent murdering of two policemen in Batticoloa would not have taken place if they were aware of national security, he said.
Commenting on the current political situation, Rajapaksa said as the issue is with Parliament, people should be given the opportunity to elect a stable government in Parliament first. Going to the people for a General Election should not be a difficulty for anyone, he added.
“The country’s Constitution should not be amended according to personal interests. It is clear that there is a problem with the 19th Amendment,” he said.
