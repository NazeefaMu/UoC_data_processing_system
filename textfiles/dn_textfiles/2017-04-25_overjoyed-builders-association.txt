An Overjoyed Builders Association..!

The world president of the International Builders Association smiled as he received a standing ovation from his members as soon as he entered the hall and walked up to the podium. The clapping and applause continued and as he looked at the happy members, he reflected how different it had been a year ago, when he’d nearly been thrown out of the board for his failed policies and how the association had almost shut down.
A year ago, most of the builders had been facing bankruptcy and somehow they had blamed him for their dismal state of affairs.
How things had changed!
“He continued walking up to make his speech and the cheering went on unabated. He allowed it to go on for a while, then raised his hands asking for quiet. “Dear Members, thank you!”
The applause was deafening, but died down as he continued, “A year ago, we were a dejected lot. Today things have changed. There is construction everywhere, and there is money in your bank accounts!”
“More money then we ever imagined!” shouted a builder, with a telltale paunch who a year ago, had been lean and skinny. “And all thanks to you!”
The President put up his hand before the applause could start again, and said, “Well I would like to thank our world leaders who listened to me! Though I must tell you, it did not take much convincing to make them see my point of view! All I did was advice them to..”
“Build walls!” shouted the hall in crescendo. “Build walls! Build walls! Build walls!” they all shouted.
“And they have started!” beamed the president. “You dear members are making money, not building high-rises, skyscrapers and towers but miles and miles of walls. Walls around countries shutting themselves off from their neighbours, walls around communities, walls around races, walls around everything you could possibly think off!”
“Build walls! Build walls! Build walls!” shouted the members in unison.
“We have to be thankful of course to President Trump, a former member of our association, who kick-started the idea in his country and now has created walls between the white collared and blue collared, the whites and the blacks and browns, and huge, thick walls between religious communities. Being a builder himself it was not too difficult selling him the idea, and other countries seeing him going on to his building spree followed suit with glee!”
The members rose again to clap and cheer and the president allowed himself a moment to bask in the glory of achievement. “We knew England would follow immediately with the Brixit Wall, but many of us are surprised with developing countries like India, so quickly becoming master builders of masonry, brick and mortar!”
The applause continued, and the president of the International Builders Association smiled as he went back to his honoured place to sit, he knew there was enough walls to build to keep him president for life..!
