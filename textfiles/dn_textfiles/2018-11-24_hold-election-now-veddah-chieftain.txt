Hold election now - Veddah chieftain

Veddah Chief Uruwarige Wannila Aththo said the country needs to go for an election now to untangle the current political impasse.
Wannila Aththo stated this when a group of academics met him to discuss the prevailing situation in the country yesterday.
“At this juncture, where the entire country is in a crisis, it would be better to give the people an opportunity take a decision for the country than giving it to the 225 public representatives in Parliament,” he said.
He said public representatives who had been elected to Parliament by the public are crossing sides continuously.Therefore, taking decisions as per their desire would further aggravate the crisis, he said.
Wannila Aththo said the conduct of MPs had damaged the image of the country before the international community.
