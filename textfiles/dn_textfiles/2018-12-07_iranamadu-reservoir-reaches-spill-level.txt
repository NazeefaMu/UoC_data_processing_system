Iranamadu reservoir reaches spill level

Northern Province Governor Reginald Cooray went on an inspection tour of the Iranamadu reservoir which had reached spill level on December 5.
Speaking on the occasion, the Governor said the Iranamadu tank covering an extent of 21,000 acres devastated during the war period had been renovated at a cost of nearly Rs. 2,000 million to revive irrigation facilities and community life.
After renovation, its sluice gate had a height of 36 feet in place of the earlier sluice gate which was only 34 feet in height.
He said the renovated reservoir will sustain 9,180 farmer families enabling them to cultivate their paddy lands during both seasons and obtain drinking water facilities.
In future, steps would be taken to divert excess water from the Iranamadu reservoir to Jaffna.
