Keppel Shipyard to deliver Yinson’s FPSO soon

 
Singapore-based Keppel Shipyard is on track to deliver a floating production storage and offloading (FPSO) vessel to Yinson Production (West Africa), a subsidiary of Malaysia’s integrated offshore production and support services provider Yinson.
The spread-moored FPSO unit was named John Agyekum Kufuor during a naming ceremony held at the shipyard on February 3, 2017.
Purchased by Yinson in 2014, John Agyekum Kufuor was converted from a tanker into an FPSO.
“FPSO John Agyekum Kufuor is our 27th conversion project for Africa, and 125th overall,” Michael Chia, Managing Director (Marine & Technology) of Keppel O&M, said.
John Agyekum Kufuor will be chartered by ENI Ghana Exploration & Production Limited (ENI Ghana) to process oil and gas from the Offshore Cape Three Points (OCTP) block located in offshore Ghana.
The FPSO has a storage capacity of 1.7 million barrels, with an oil processing capacity of 58,000 barrels per day. It has a design life of 20 years without dry docking and can be moored in an average water depth of 1,000 meters with a total topside weight of almost 15,000 tons.
Keppel Shipyard said that its work on the FPSO included modification work, new equipment installation, as well as installation and integration of the FPSO process topsides.
