Fixing the ‘unfixable’

The forthcoming local elections are so important. The UNP’s presence at the local level following these elections will determine the future of our economy.
Following the passage of the 19th Amendment and the establishment of the Independent Election Commission, we are witnessing a peaceful election free from money power, posters and violence. The amendments to the Local Authorities Election Law proposed by the UNP will be giving, for the first time, women power to deliver for their local area with record levels of female representation. It will also now be possible for everyone to vote for their local representative directly with the new wards system.

We must ensure that everyone who votes in this election can do so peacefully, with a clear mind on their future. Whether it be a father thinking about an improved local road or a mother safe in the knowledge she can provide clean drinking water for her children or a young person enjoying recreational facilities. The UNP want to build up the people of Sri Lanka to reach their full potential.
The UNP in national government is focused on building up the national economy. We have delivered on attracting new investments, creating jobs, more housing progress and building public infrastructure. But there is still more to be done.
This progress has to be brought to the villages and the towns to improve the economic and social standards of all Sri Lankans, more money for local government and a stronger local village economy.
A strong UNP presence in local government means a stronger UNP in national government and a stronger national economy. Voting for the UNP locally guarantees a good deal from the national government for your area. Your local issues can only be fixed if we have a strong national economy. Otherwise there will be no money to do anything.
A strong economy is able to fund activities at a local government level to build better local roads, provide safer drinking water, clean-up our streets, prevent dengue and make local transport more reliable.
At this election, you have a choice. By voting for your carefully selected, educated and honest local UNP candidate, you can guarantee the best deal from national government for your area.
The UNP has demonstrated our ability to deliver for people across the country at a national level. Now we must lift up local communities directly through local government.
Victory at these elections will enable the UNP to build on the progress made since 2015 and means sticking with our plan to build a stronger economy and help us secure an outright victory in the next general election.
So be sure that this election will be close and every vote will count.
Voting for another party or not voting at all - which is effectively the same thing - risks getting a bad deal from national government for your local area and missing out on future development that will make the lives of you and your family better.
Only the UNP has the knowledge and ability to fix our economy. And only this government is trusted by the international community to deliver a fair and just economy where foreign companies will invest. Only by sticking to our plan to strengthen our economy can we keep Sri Lanka on the path to a better future. And only voting UNP will deliver funds for your area.
