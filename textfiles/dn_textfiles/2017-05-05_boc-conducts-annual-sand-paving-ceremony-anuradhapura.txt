Organized by the Bank’s North Central Province Assistant General Manager Ranjith Welikannage and his team and sponsored by the Bank, this act of devotion takes place annually with the participation of members of the bank’s staff and many other Buddhist devotees coming from all parts of the country as a respond to the Bank’s open invitation to participate at this event.
Every year Thousands of Buddhists come to worship Jaya Shri Maha Bodhi daily and this act will provide a cleaner environment to those who come to worship.
The chronicles of Sinhalese, known as the Mahawansaya says that miracles occurred during the ceremony of planting the Jaya Shri Maha Bodhi sapling. Since then the Bodhi has been worshipped as one of the most sacred objects of Buddhist worship.
