Ancient courts complex neglected

The ancient courts complex at Hambantota which is about one hundred and fifty years old was abandoned when the new courts complex was setup several years ago.
Currently the courts complex remains overgrown with shrub jungle. This is a historical monument that should be protected for the future generation but the relevant authorities at Hambantota and the officials of the Department of Archaeology observe silence for reasons not known.
