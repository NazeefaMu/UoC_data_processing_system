“The 24-hour book sale concept is to allow all those who are travelling from outskirts of Colombo and those who are working late, to still come and get their reading needs at any time of the day that is most convenient to them. Customers can enjoy 255 hours of non-stop book browsing and get their hands on various types of books,” shared Dipak Madhavan, Malaysian Partner of Big Bad Wolf Books.
This year, The Big Bad Wolf Sale is supported by The Ministry of Education of Sri Lanka. The partners of the Sale are Bank of Ceylon – the official banking partner, Mobitel – the official telco partner, and the sale is powered by The Capital Maharaja Organisation Limited.
Director of ProRead Lanka Nishan Wasalathanthri said, “The aim of a book sale of this scale and nature is to make good books available at an affordable price and to contribute towards the rising readership numbers by increasing awareness on the value of quality English books that can help improve English literacy among Sri Lankans”.
This year The Big Bad Wolf will also be donating books to communities in need through their Red Readerhood programme, supporting The Capital Maharaja Organisation Limited’s Gammadda initiative. Customers can participate in this worthy initiative by purchasing selected books at the Red Readerhood section and donating them at the same place.
