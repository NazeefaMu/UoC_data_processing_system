Joy of a toy

A wind spinner that splinters, a car with its metallic paint peeling, brightly-coloured plastic balls that go into the mouth and sometimes in the nose - toys are not the safest. Here are some tips that will help you choose the perfect playing thing for the child of your life.
Look at toys that grow with the child
This helps the child develop the ability to cherish the toy, rather than encouraging a use-and-throw culture. Children like to be challenged — a child may first just climb the ladder to a slide, and then sit at the top for a while, before gradually sliding down. As he gains confidence, he will climb the slide from the opposite end. Ask the toymaker how the toy will develop with the child.
Pick gender-neutral toys
Buy toys that don’t have a gender at all, that focus on the character, so the child is free to imagine it in his or her own way.
Consider fooducation
The best way to get kids who fuss about food out of the habit, is to involve them in the cooking process. Encourage them to help out with prep, so they’re more likely to eat what they’ve ‘cooked’, building their palate and developing a healthy relationship with food.
Get a toy with a positive message
Even as Barbie turns ‘real’ with different body shapes, there’s Nanea Mitchell, the newest doll from American Girl. A dark-skinned half-Hawaiian, she’s from 1941 wartime America. Then there’s Hearts for Hearts that has dolls from all over the world.
Read the toy label right Look for the company name
Not heard of them? Check them out online. If they’re being imported, they pass our standards and are safe to use. If they are exporting to Europe, the US and Australia, they’ll be safe as well.
Follow age grades
If a toy stipulates 3-6 months, it is only meant for that age group. There may also be a warning about small parts, so pay attention to that. www.thehindu.com
