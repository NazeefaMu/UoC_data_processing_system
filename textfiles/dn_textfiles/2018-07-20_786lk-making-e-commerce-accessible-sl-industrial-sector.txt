786.lk making e-Commerce accessible to SL industrial sector

A new entrant in the Sri Lankan e-Commerce space, 786.lk is making waves across the digital landscape as the country’s pioneering e-Commerce platform dedicated to industrial products and services.
With a soft launch in April this year, 786.lk has fast spread their wings to cover Sri Lanka’s industrial manufacturing segment - a market sector that lacked the serviceability and commercialization on existing e-Commerce platforms in the country.
786.lk was initiated as a groundbreaking platform for e-Commerce and supporting e-Logistics services for locally manufactured industrial products, and in three months on-boarded is leading Sri Lankan companies to include fast-moving sub-sectors such as solar components, electrical components, power tools and machinery on the platform.
The overarching objective of 786.lk is to take the ‘Made in Sri Lanka’ label to the world through products that are not traded on other e-commerce platforms that were identified to be mainly industrial-based, and are looking to expand the platform across all verticals.
The exporting of the sold products falls under the company’s e-Logisitics service offering that offers the most economical and ecofriendly export service for goods purchased via the 786.lk website. Additionally, the team at 786.lk are also offering a collaborative approach for vendors who are on-boarding the website on how to reach and target a wider export market.
The company is now looking to meet the demand of the rapidly growing local customer-base by creating an island wide agent network segregated to 3 areas covering the Western, Southern and Central regions of the country respectively. This will further consolidate the company’s benchmarked standards in customer servicing, with guaranteed rapid response and delivery times as well as supportive and personalized customer support and consulting.
“We are thrilled to see the enthusiasm shown by local suppliers and manufacturers of industrial goods who have finally found a digital solution that fits their marketing needs,” stated Pubudu Thiloshana, Head of Operationsof 786.lk. “Our main criteria when on-boarding vendors is high quality products traded at a very competitive rate.
Our own pricing model does not tax the supplier with a monthly fee, but is rather based on a percentage of the sales carried out within the month. This has been one of the most attractive offerings that has been successful with our potential vendor base.”
The company has numerous more expansion strategies in store for the platform, and are encouraging small and medium scale enterprises (SMEs) to also join the platform under the ‘ApeyDeyak’ sub category, a service created by the company to empower local businesses to explore their customer base for consumer goods that are Made in Sri Lanka.
