Compensation for land owners soon

The government has instructed the Irrigation Department to accelerate the payment of compensation to those who have been moved from their lands taken over by the government for the construction of the proposed Yan Oya reservoir.
A 3Km dam is being built across the Yan Oya river close to Wahalkada in the Horowpothana Divisional Secretariat division under the programme. The estimated cost of the project is Rs. 34,000 million.
According to Irrigation Department sources, 546 families in the project site area are being evacuated and resettled. Rs. 13,000 million will be payed to them as compensation.
According to Project Director Eng. Palitha Wickramatilake, Yan Oya reservoir construction is to be completed by mid 2017.
