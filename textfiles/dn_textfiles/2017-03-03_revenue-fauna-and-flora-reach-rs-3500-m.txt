Revenue from fauna and flora to reach Rs. 3,500 m

Estimated revenue of Wildlife Conservation Department, National Botanical Gardens Department and National Zoological Gardens Department for 2017, is reported as Rs. 3,500 million, Sustainable Development and Wildlife Minister Gamini Jayawickrama Perera said.
Speaking at a media briefing at the Sustainable Development and Wildlife Ministry yesterday, the minister said 3,500 km long electrified elephant fences would be erected to control the human-elephant conflict.
He said fences will be constructed linking Information Technology (IT) to establish an uninterrupted execution of the fences. A team will monitor the controlling systems of the electrified fences islandwide.
The minister said a special computerised system will be installed to trains along with a vibration detector to track down elephant movements to avoid accidents caused to elephants by trains.
He said 16 damaged elephant corridors due to human intervention will be recovered this year.
Perera said: “Ten digital screens will be set up in zoological gardens and botanical garden following the initial launch at the Dehiwela Zoo. They will be established to educate the public on environmental conservation and to provide a platform to promote tourism. This will be financed by the Wildlife Trust and other donations.”
The minister made it mandatory for wildlife officers to wear the uniform within the working hours.
Perera said ‘Sewa Prasadini’ Awards Ceremony will be held on March 3 under the patronage of President Maithripala Sirisena at the Bandaranaike Memorial International Conference Hall (BMICH).
The Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) Forum will take place in Sri Lanka in 2018, the minister said.
