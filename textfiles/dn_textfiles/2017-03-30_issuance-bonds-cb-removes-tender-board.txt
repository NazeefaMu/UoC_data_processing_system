Issuance of bonds: CB removes Tender Board

Deputy Central Bank Governor P.Samarasiri said the Monetary Board has taken a decision to reconstitute all the members of the Tender Board of the Central Bank until the proceedings of the Presidential Commission inquiring into the Treasury bond issue ends.
It was revealed at the Presidential Commission that all the members of the Tender Board have received letters on March 24, 2017 sent by the present Governor in which the reasons for the removals were stated. According to the said letter the Monetary Board is of the view that ‘in the context of good governance and in order to enable conducive environment for the ongoing proceedings of the Commission of inquiry it would be appropriate if the officers who were members of the Tender Board during the period from February 2015 to March 2016 not continue in their substantive positions until the findings of the inquiry are made.’
It was pointed out the removal was not done just to an individual but the entire Tender Board.The decision for the removal has been made before DG Samarasiri started testifying before the Commission.
DG Samarasiri was the ex officio Chairman of the Tender Board from February 2015 up until the recent removal.
