Union opposes closing down of State Medical Faculty

The State Medical Students’ Parents’ Union strongly opposes the closing down of the State Medical Faculty of the Eastern University, State Medical Students’ Parents’ Union Media Spokesman Wasantha Alwis said.
Addressing the media in Colombo yesterday, he said that the union opposes the move because there is no connection of the Medical Faculty to the issue of the nursing course and the Health Science Faculty.
Therefore, there is no point of closing down the State Medical Faculty.
Alwis said it is possible to have hidden agendas behind the closing down of this State Medical Faculty because there are many reasons for the Government and certain persons to close down this State Medical Faculty of the Eastern University. There is a private medical faculty,’Baticaloa Campus of Sri Lanka’ to be opened soon. It is located very close to the Eastern University.
“Closing down the State Medical Faculty for more than two weeks is a grave violation of their right to education and the issue will be brought to the notice of the Higher Education Minister by the union,” he added.
