Patali misused public property

A complaint was made to the IGP’s relief centre at Police Headquarters yesterday against former Minister Patali Champika Ranawaka for alleged misuse of the property belonging to the Megapolis and Western Development Ministry including the Ministry office and its vehicles.
The complaint was made by the ‘Satya Gaveshakayo’ organisation. A team of lawyers belonging to the organaisation led by its convenor, attorney-at-law Premanatha C. Dolawatte handed over the complaint.
Dolawatte said Patali Champika Ranawaka had not only misused property belonging to the Megapolis and Western Development Ministry, but had also trespassed into the Ministry office and held various discussions with the Ministry staff.
It was taxpayers’ money that the former Minister had misused. Dolawatte said he hoped the IGP would not only pay attention to this serious complaint, but also conduct a proper and fair investigation into it.
Fielding a question raised by the media, Dolawatte said that his organisation had made several other complaints too to the IGP during the past, but the IGP had failed to investigate them.
He said the former minister had committed the alleged offence of criminal misuse of public property under the provisions of Sections 386 and 388 of the Penal code.
