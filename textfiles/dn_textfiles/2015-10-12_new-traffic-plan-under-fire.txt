New traffic plan under fire

The new traffic plan introduced to lessen congestion during morning rush hours in the Colombo city was called into question by the public yesterday due to difficulties faced by them.
Heavy traffic was reported at the Rajagiriya junction, Maharagama junction and several roads leading to Colombo.
The new traffic plan was implemented yesterday between 7.30 a.m. and 8.45 a.m. to ease congestion in Colombo.
All vehicles plying from Battaramulla to Colombo were diverted to Sri Jayewardenepura Road opposite Welikada Police to the Ayurveda roundabout while vehicles leaving Colombo were diverted to Kotta Road from Borella towards Battaramulla.
Some commuters reported of being late to their work places by as much as an hour. It was reported that in Rajagiriya, pedestrians had to walk more than 300 to 400 metres for a bus halt as the halts were also shifted to a different place. People had to walk from Rajagiriya town to the parliamentary road to get a bus to travel to Colombo.
The new traffic plan introduced in several parts of Colombo became neither accessible nor reliable to the people.
The area got more congested during the peak hour even after the new traffic plan was introduced. The chaos revealed that a viable and more practical traffic system is needed to resolve the current congestion in the Colombo city, commuters told the Daily News.
