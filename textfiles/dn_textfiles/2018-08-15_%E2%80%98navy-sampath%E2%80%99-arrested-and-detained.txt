‘NAVY SAMPATH’ ARRESTED and DETAINED

Hettiarachchi Mudiyanselage Chandana Prasad Hettiarachchi known as ‘Navy Sampath’, wanted in connection with the abduction, torture, extortion and murder of 11 persons in 2008 and 2009 was yesterday ordered to be kept under CID custody until today (15) by the Colombo Chief Magistrate’s Court.
Colombo Additional Magistrate Kanchana N. Silva ordered the suspect to be detained under CID custody until today, for further questioning.
He was arrested by the Criminal Investigation Department (CID) on Monday in Lotus road, according to the Police Media Spokesman’s office.
The suspect had been impersonating a guard named Polwattage Gallage Ashoka with a fake National Identity Card. He had been working as a guard in an estate in Dompe. The arrest had been made by OIC of CID’s Gang Robbery Unit-Inspector Nishantha Silva in Colombo.
Hettiarachchi was in the Sri Lanka Navy in the rank of Lieutenant Commander. He was wanted by police in connection with kidnapping for ransom, illegal detention and murder of 11 youths in 2008 and 2009. He also had a warrant issued against him in connection with the assassination of former MP Nadarajah Raviraj.
Previously, he had been issued an open warrant to be arrested by the Fort Magistrate’s Court. Speaking on the case, Law and Order Minister Ranjith Maddumabandara said the CID has been given the freedom to carry out their investigations without any political interference or pressure.
‘Navy Sampath’ had a warrant issued by the Colombo Fort Magistrate’s Court for his arrest but had been evading arrest and the CID believed that he was being harboured by certain parties. The CID warned that legal action would be taken against anyone found to harbour this fugitive.
The CID is currently investigating the abduction and disappearance of 11 youth and several navy personnel have been arrested in this connection including former Navy spokesman Commodore D.K.P. Dassanayake.
The CID is investigating the abduction and disappearance of 11 youth based on a written complaint by then Navy Commander Admiral Wasantha Karannagoda to the DIG CID on May 28, 2009 against his personal security officer, then Lt. Commander Nilantha Sampath Munasinghe following which the CID was able to uncover the Navy’s involvement with the abductions.
Those abducted were Kasthuriarachchilage John Rit alias John, Rajiv Naganathan alias Malli, Pradeep Vishvanathan, Tillakeshwaran Ramalingam, Mohomed Sajith, Jamamdeen Dilan, Amalan Leon, Roshan Leon, Anthony Kasthuriarachchi, Theagaraja Jegan and Mohomed Ali Anver alias Hajiya.
