New home for courageous woman

Army personnel of the 57 Division collected funds and offered a new house to an iconic Sinhalese woman who lived in Kilinochchi, irrespective of numerous terrorist threats and untold hardships.
This was in coordination with the technical expertise, provided by 9 Vijayabahu Infantry Regiment (VIR) troops of the 571 Brigade.
The septuagenarian, Hemalatha of Deraniyagala, Kirihena with her husband has lived in Krishnapuram II village after she arrived in Krishnapuram II village in Kilinochchi in 1979.
Having left her four children with her parents elsewhere as LTTE terrorist threats were on the rise in the Kilinochchi region, they both put up a cadjan hut and continued to reside there. In 1996, after terrorists intensified fighting, she was forced to take refuge in a refugee camp and live there for nearly 4 years.
Afterwards, she began to sell vegetables in Kilinochchi town and later she developed good acquaintances with Tamil residents there.
However, she returned to her cadjan hut again with her husband in Krishnapuram after troops cleared Kilinochchi from LTTE terrorists in 2009 and was leading a hand to mouth life when their plight was brought to the notice of Major General Vijitha Ravipriya, General Officer Commanding (GOC) 57 Division.
After serious thoughts of the possibility of constructing a new house for them, all troops serving the 57 Division consented after they were enlightened on this proposed meritorious and humanitarian project.
Accordingly, engineering and technical expertise of 9 Vijayabahu Infantry Regiment (VIR) troops of the 571 Brigade undertook the construction part under the guidance of the GOC, 571 Brigade Commander and the Commanding Officer 9 VIR, Major Dananjaya Udapamunuwa on July 15, 2018.
On November 18, arrangements were in place to formally vest the house with Hemalatha and her husband who had undergone the bitter side of life for over 40 years. Major General Ravipriya, along with Colonel Najeewa Edirisinghe, 571 Brigade Commander and 9 VIR Commanding Officer, Officers and Other Ranks in a ceremony formally vested the new house with them.
