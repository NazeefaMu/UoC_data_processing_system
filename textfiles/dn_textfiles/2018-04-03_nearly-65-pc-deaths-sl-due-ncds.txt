Nearly 65 pc deaths in SL due to NCDs

Nearly 65 percent of hospital deaths in Sri Lanka is due to Non-Communicable Diseases (NCDs), of which nearly 17 percent occur prematurely, Health Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne said.
Addressing the first annual NCD meeting of the SAARC countries held in Colombo recently, he said with regard to the 10 global targets for NCDs to be achieved by 2025, Sri Lanka has launched a multi-sectoral action plan built on four strategic pillars - advocacy, partnerships, leadership and health promotion.
Underlying these is the reorienting of the health system for early detection and management of NCDs and their risk factors, surveillance and operational research.
According to Minister Senaratne, one of the key initiatives in NCD control is strengthening primary healthcare facilities in the country. Close to 950 ‘Healthy Lifestyle Centers’ located island-wide linked to MOH offices provide screening for cardiovascular diseases, diabetes and cancers. These and the ‘Well Woman Clinics’ function as screening centres for NCDs. In the future, the screening centres will be linked with diagnostic facilities, backed up by medical specialists. All centres will be digitized to facilitate the exchange of medical information, record keeping, stock management etc.
“We have taken action to reduce the price of essential drugs, some by more than 400 percent, but most by 40 to 100 percent. This is a relief for patients, especially those being treated by private health service providers. We have also lifted the price ceiling on cancer drugs to be provided free at government facilities,” said the Minister.
He added: “Now the patients can get the best of medication, often costly, free of charge at government facilities. We have also extended similar benefits towards eye care, providing the best quality eye lenses to patients free of charge. Similar packages have been introduced for expensive, urgently needed cardio-thoracic medication including cardiac stents. The process, which has already started, is still being fine-tuned and will be fully operational by 2020.”
