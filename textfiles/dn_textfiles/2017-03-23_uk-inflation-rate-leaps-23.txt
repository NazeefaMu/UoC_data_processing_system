UK inflation rate leaps to 2.3%

Rising fuel and food prices helped to push last month's inflation rate to the highest since September 2013.
Inflation as measured by the Office for National Statistics’ Consumer Prices Index (CPI) jumped to 2.3% in February - up from 1.8% in January.
The increase has pushed the rate above the Bank of England's 2% target.
Food prices recorded their first annual increase for more than two-and-a-half years, standing 0.3% higher in February than a year earlier. The Bank of England has said it expects inflation will peak at 2.8% next year, although some economists think the rate could rise above 3%.
“DON'T PANIC” are the words that will be written across the Bank of England's next inflation report, in large friendly letters. Well, maybe not, but the Bank's governor, Mark Carney, said pretty much the same when he was quizzed over today's jump in inflation. Actually, what he said was, “Look - single data point, you never overreact to a single data point,” but then he is a central banker and not the author of the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy.
It does, however, amount to much the same thing. The Bank of England is not going to be panicked into increasing interest rates to try to control price rises just because of one month's figures. But that doesn't mean they aren't important.
