Galadari celebrates Admin Professionals' Day

The Galadari Hotel celebrated Admin Professionals' Day in grand style at the Coffee Shop recently. The gala luncheon buffet included an elaborate spread which was a magnificent sight to behold.
A buzz of activity was experienced from the guests who feasted on the mouthwatering spread which included a range of items including specialty breads, salads, meat and fish dishes to a delectable selection of desserts and much more.
The day climaxed featuring a special raffle draw.
Upali Perera, the Financial Controller gave a warm welcome to his secretarial staff and in appreciation gifted them with a rose and a specially done cake.
