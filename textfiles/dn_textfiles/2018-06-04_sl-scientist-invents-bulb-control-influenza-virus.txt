SL scientist invents bulb to control influenza virus

Manju Gunawardene, a scientist attached to the Sri Lanka Institute of Nanotechnology, has invented a bulb to control the influenza virus.
The bulb, which has received world acclaim, helped him to win a gold medal at the World New Inventions Congress held in Geneva in 2012.
Gunawardene said epidemics are spread through three main venues - through hospitals, patients suffering from epidemics and long exposure to particles in the air.
“We detected a nano particle which can destroy any bacteria, waste or any virus. We applied this nano particle to the surface of the blub.
Patient suffering from influenza, diarrhea, allergy, eye disease or viral bacterial or epidemic condition can be recovered by keeping the bulb lit,” he said.
He said, however, he approached several authorities in the health field in Sri Lanka to make them aware of the importance of his invention, but to date, they did not use his invention to benefit the public.
