Sports Minister makes stunning revelation

 
Two Sri Lankan cricketers Rangana Herath and Kusal Perera have been approached for match fixing by an individual associated with the national cricket team Sports Minister Dayasiri Jayasekera revealed at a press conference yesterday.
This individual had approached Perera during practice to 'fix' a match during the home series between Sri Lanka and West Indies in October-November.
"I have complained regarding this matter to the Financial Crimes Investigation Division (FCID)," said the Minister.
"This person who is assisting the players during the practice sessions has links with match fixers," the Minister said.
The Minister queried as to why Sri Lanka Cricket had not taken any steps to investigate the persons involved in this kind of activities.
"This is a link for worldwide match-fixing which is a big issue. I hope this individual who is supposed to help the national players during practice sessions will be arrested shortly and an inquiry held into this matter," he said.
