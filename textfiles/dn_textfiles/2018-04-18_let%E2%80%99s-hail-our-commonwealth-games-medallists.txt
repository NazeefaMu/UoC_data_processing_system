Let’s hail our Commonwealth Games medallists

Sri Lanka has every reason to feel elated with their performances at the recently concluded XXIst Commonwealth Games in Gold Coast, Australia as our competitors brought home the highest medals tally in the history of the Games since 1938 when they first participated.
Although Sri Lanka did not win a single Gold medal they collected one Silver and five Bronze making it a tally of six medals overall which outstripped the four (1 Gold, 2 Silver, 1 Bronze) won at the 1950 Commonwealth Games in Auckland, New Zealand. On that occasion the Gold was won in athletics by Duncan White in the men’s 440 yards hurdles, the 2 Silvers and 1 Bronze in boxing by K Edwin (Flyweight) and Albert Perera (Bantamweight) and Bronze by Alex Obeysekere (Welterweight).
Thus it is after 68 years that Sri Lanka has once again shone in boxing by winning three medals at Gold Coast. However on this occasion they have produced the first boxing medal won by a woman for Sri Lanka in the Games’ history when 38-year-old Anusha Kodituwakku took the Bronze in the 48kg category. She was unfortunate to meet India’s experienced woman boxer 35-year-old Mary Kom in the semi-finals which she lost unanimously on points.
Anusha, a former Sri Lanka women’s rugby sevens player who is employed by MAS Holdings - a strong promoter of boxing, suffered a horrific injury when she broke her collarbone and suffered a fractured knee from a road accident during the 2014 Commonwealth Games in Glasgow, that almost ended her career as a sportsperson. However after a long layoff and rehabilitation Anusha fought her way back to make a miraculous recovery and comeback to win a Commonwealth Games medal for her country four years later at Gold Coast.
The other two Bronze medals in boxing were won in the men’s category by former Vidyarthian southpaw Thiwanka Ranasinghe in the 49kg class and by Vidanalange Bandara in the 52kg class – both on their Commonwealth Games debut.
It was in Australia that Sri Lanka won their first Commonwealth Games medal when in Sydney in 1938 Barney Henricus, a sub inspector in the Ceylon Police Force (as it was then known) won the Gold in boxing fighting in the featherweight (57kg) class. Henricus defeated Scotsman James Watson in the final. Henricus served in the Police Force for 33 years before retiring as a Chief Inspector and migrating to the US in 1988 where he later passed away in California in 2007 at the age of 91.
For the next seven Commonwealth Games that Sri Lanka participated from 1954 to 1990 (they did not participate in 1954, 1974 and 1986) they had a barren run not winning a single medal. The drought was broken once more in Australia in Victoria in 1994 where Sri Lanka won one Gold and two Silvers – all in shooting. Pushpamali Ramanayake of the Sri Lanka Army and Malini Wickramasinghe did their country proud by winning Sri Lanka’s third gold medal in the Games’ history in the Women’s Air Rifle Pairs. Malini also went onto bag Silver in the Women’s Air Rifle event. The second Silver was won in the Men’s Small Bore Rifle Prone Pairs by Dodangoda Chandrasiri and Lakshman Rajasinghe.
Sri Lanka followed this success at the next Commonwealth Games in Kuala Lumpur in 1998 by winning their first medals in athletics with Silver and a Bronze. Sriyani Kulawansa won the women’s 100 metres hurdles Silver and Sugath Tillakaratne the men’s 400 metres Bronze.
Sri Lanka’s fourth and last Gold medal at the Commonwealth Games was won once again in Australia (Melbourne) in 2006 in weightlifting that was to play a prominent role in the country’s success for the next decade or so. Chinthana Vidanage, a product of Polonnaruwa Royal Central College covered himself with glory by winning his country’s only medal (Gold) at the 2006 Games in the men’s 62kg category. Vidanage went onto win Silver in the men’s 69kg class at the next Commonwealth Games held in Delhi in 2010 to join Malini Wickramasinghe and another weightlifter Sudesh Peiris as the only three Lankans to have won more than one Commonwealth Games medals. As overall captain of the 2018 Sri Lanka team to the XXIst Commonwealth Games in Gold Coast Vidanage made a valiant attempt to win a third medal but failed in the men’s 77kg category.
Sudesh Peiris who hails from Kurunegala won a Bronze in the men’s 62kg at Delhi, 2010 and improved on that performance at the next Games in Glasgow, Scotland four years later by winning the Silver in the same class as overall captain of his country.
At Gold Coast, Dinusha Gomes won Sri Lanka’s first Commonwealth Games medal at women’s weightlifting with a Bronze in the 48kg class. Able Seaman Indika Dissanayake of the Sri Lanka Navy took the Silver in the men’s 69kg category and Corporal Chaturanga Lakmal of the Sri Lanka Army the Bronze in the men’s 56kg class.
Thus Sri Lanka’s overall medals tally at the Commonwealth Games is 20 (4 Golds, 8 Silvers, 8 Bronze) with Boxing and Weightlifting grabbing the lions share with seven apiece leaving Shooting and Athletics to share the remaining six.
As one would have gathered by the facts provided of the medal winners by now these are athletes who have come up the hard way from rural areas with basic facilities to bring glory to their homeland. They are the most deserving but the least recognized for their efforts because the sport they indulge in is not one of the more glamorous ones that catch the headlines often. It is their sheer determination to succeed and the hunger for recognition that has brought them to the forefront, more than anything else. Once they are out of the scene they are quickly forgotten and sometimes never seen or heard again. It is a sad reflection of our sports culture that we all live in.
