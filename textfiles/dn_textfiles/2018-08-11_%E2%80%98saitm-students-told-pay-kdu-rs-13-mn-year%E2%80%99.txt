‘SAITM students told to pay kdu Rs 1.3 mn per year’

SAITM students who are to be absorbed to the Kotelawela Defence University (KDU) have been asked to pay Rs 1.3 million per year, JVP MP Dr Nalinda Jayatissa said.
He pointed out this was unfair as these students had been paying money to SAITM for many years. He made this comment while moving a private member’s motion in Parliament yesterday.
“When we passed the legislation to give effect to the transfer of the SAITM students, there was no mentioning of payment of money to the KDU. The transfers must be done free of charge,” he said.
UNP MP Prof. Ashu Marasinghe joining in the same debate said even the students who received free scholarships from the SAITM have been asked to pay money when transferred to the KDU.
He requested Government intervention to settle this matter.
