Work on ‘World’s tallest Christmas Tree’ recommences

 
Work on what will be the world’s tallest Christmas tree on record has recommenced after Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe intervened to speak to Archbishop Cardinal Malcom Ranjit Fernando.
The project to build the 100m long tree on the Galle Face Green was abandoned after the Archbishop called it a ‘wasteful expenditure’ and suggested the monies be used to build homes for the homeless and provide children with scholarship.
The Premier had met with the Archbishop yesterday, together with Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayake, and the go-ahead was later given to Ports and Shipping Minister Arjuna Ranatunga whose initiative this was.
Project Committee Chairman Mangala P. Gunasekera explained:  “A group of people had informed the Archbishop that the construction was being carried out using the government’s money. But, neither the money of government nor the Port Ministry is used for the construction. The construction is based only on personnel funds. They are also not financial funds, but physical assistance,” he said.
The world’s tallest Christmas Tree is expected to be unveiled on December 20, as scheduled.
