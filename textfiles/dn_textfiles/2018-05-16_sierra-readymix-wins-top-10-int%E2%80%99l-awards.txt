Sierra Readymix wins Top 10 at the Int’l Awards

Sierra Readymix was adjudged as one of the ‘Top 10 Best Practices in the World’ at the 5th International Best Practice Competition held in Mumbai, India.
The Company won this prestigious position for its CSR initiative done in collaboration with ‘SIRASA TV GammeddaProgramme’ to construct a series of buildings at the Mune Sinhala Vidyalaya in Kandakuliya, Puttalam and install a solar power generation system at the premises in order to provide a cost-efficient and a green energy solution to the school.
Sierra Readymix previously won a place amongst the top 23 at the International Best Practice Awards held in the Philippines for its pioneering practice of Waste Process Water Reduction, Grout Accumulation Reduction and Precast Reutilization, in its efforts to minimize the environmental impact of current industry practices.
L . C. Weerasinghe, Director/General Manager said, “There is much to be done in terms of assisting this particular school as well as other schools in the area.
However, we were happy to set precedence in supporting the community in the area, in particular the future generation who will one day join the driving force behind our country.”
Sierra Readymix built five class rooms, a multipurpose building, a theatre along with a dressing room and a movable classroom that can double as a main conference hall at the school premises. The solar power system installed at the school premises today provides electricity to the school.
Mune Sinhala Vidyalaya in Kandakuliya, Puttalam facilitates around 400 students from grade 1 – 9. The school lacked even the basic infrastructure, compelling a large number of students to attend classes in the shade of a tree.
Having identified this crucial requirement, Sierra Readymix stepped forward to provide assistance and succeeded in constructing the multi-purpose building within a month’s time as discussed with the students and parents.
D.N.N. Lokuge, Chairman, Sierra Readymix and L. C. Weerasinghe, Director/General Manager, Sierra Readymix were instrumental in carrying out the entire project to complete construction of the series of buildings and installing the solar power system.
