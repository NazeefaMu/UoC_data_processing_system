Govt. needs 146,000 blocks of land for resettling

 
 The government is in need of 146,000 blocks of land in Kegalle, Ratnapura and Kandy districts to resettle the people in landslide prone areas, Land State Minister T.B. Ekanayake said.
Addressing a press conference at the Disaster Management Centre yesterday, the state minister said the government has already commenced identifying suitable alternative lands to resettle these families.
He said each relocated family should be given a land unit of at least 10-20 perches.
Ekanayake said President Maithripala Sirisena has ordered to take over the uncultivated lands belonging to plantation companies under the Land Reform Commission (LRC) also for this purpose.
He said a Special Gazette Notification would be issued to take over such uncultivated lands suitable for resettlement.
“All these lands will be selected subject to the observations and recommendations of the National Building Research Organisation, Disaster Management Centre and Geological Survey and Mines Bureau. This time we are more particular about the recommendations of these authorities that those lands are safe for people to reside in,” Ekanayake said.
“The identification of 146,000 land blocks has already commenced with the coordination of the Land Commissioner General’s Department, Survey Department, LRC and relevant district and divisional secretaries. The construction of houses in these lands has been undertaken by the National Housing Development Authority,” he said.
“The problem is that many people in mountainous areas cultivate cardamom and cloves. They are reluctant to leave that area and move. We have paid attention to this issue as well,” Ekanayake said.
Disaster Management Minister Anura Priyadarshana Yapa, explaining on the current situation in disaster hit areas, said the flood water was gradually receding in many parts and the number of people in temporary camps was decreasing.
As of yesterday, 115,494 people belonging to 25,793 families are in 291 temporary camps. The number of deaths had risen to 92 while another 108 are still missing. Thirty three people had sustained injuries due to natural disaster, he said.
The minister said the cleaning of houses, wells, tube wells, roads and other public places have commenced in areas where flood water had receded.
He said the Presidential Task Force would meet every two weeks to discuss on the future course of action.
“The government has disbursed money needed for disaster relief measures and post-disaster activities. We have also got foreign aid and those have been deposited in the account under our ministry or given to the Treasury. The donations of items received from foreign countries would be distributed to the people via Army and Air Force personnel,” Yapa said.
Commenting on the on-going operations by the Army in Aranayake, Major General Sudantha Ranasinghe said 27 bodies and parts of another 20 bodies had been recovered in the area. He said the number of soldiers deployed for search operations was reduced to 100 yesterday. “There are difficulties in identifying some bodies. As of the information we have collected, we suspect over 100 persons are still buried under the soil. We will continue search operations to find their bodies, but we may have to discuss with the authorities and people to end the search operations in the coming days,” Yapa said.
He said the boat operations in Colombo was also stopped by yesterday.
Civil Defence Force Major Vajira Kumaratunga said a team of 800 had been deployed for cleaning activities in disaster hit areas.
Megapolis and Western Development Ministry Secretary N Rupasinghe said plans are afoot to construct two new tunnels to carry water to the sea to control the floods in the city.
“As of now Colombo goes under water from about 250 mm rainfall. After the construction of these two tunnels it will resist for a rainfall of about 350mm. The constructions will be completed within two years,” he said.
Irrigation Minister Vijith Wijayamuni de Zoysa, Environment Ministry Secretary Udaya N Seneviratne, NBRO Director (Landslide) R M S Bandara and Health Ministry Epidemic Control Unit Director Pabha Paihawadena also spoke.
