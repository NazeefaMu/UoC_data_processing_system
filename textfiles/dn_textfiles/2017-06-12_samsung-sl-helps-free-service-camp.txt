Samsung SL helps with free service camp

Samsung SL reaches out to affected communities with free service camp for flood damaged Samsung products
In a gesture that will enable flood affected communities to overcome difficulties with regard to their damaged equipment, Samsung Sri Lanka plans to host a free service camp in Galle and Matara for all Samsung devices and products.
The Service Camp will be held from June 7-21 and will provide free labour and a discount of 50% on all affected parts. This will be a special incentive for customers with a view towards enabling them to repair their products with minimal effort.
“We believe that we can reach out to communities affected by the floods in this manner with a service they would require”said HanBae Park, Managing Director of Samsung Sri Lanka,“It not only gives us an opportunity to do something for them but also enables us to give our time and effort towards the most vital part of recovery, that of returning back to normalcy.”
Samsung Sri Lanka says that consumers can bring their flood damaged Samsung products to the location of the Service Camp.
Samsung Sri Lanka confirms that sooner these products are brought in, the greater chances they will have of being repaired and restored in the right manner.
“This service camp will be manned by our experts who can attend to the products as soon as possible.Which would be the best way to restore the products without having to take them anywhere else ; which may damage them further,” he adds. In addition to the service camp, Samsung Sri Lanka has also donated school stationary items consisting of 5,000 books and writing instruments to students in areas affected by the recent floods.
