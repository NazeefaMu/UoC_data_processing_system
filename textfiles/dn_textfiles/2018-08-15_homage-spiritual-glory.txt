Homage to  spiritual glory

The 2018 Esala festivals of the Kataragama Kiri Vehera and the Ruhunu Kataragama Maha Devalaya, two important places of worship in Sri Lanka, are being illuminated by the Swadeshi Industrial Works PLC, the pioneer herbal - personal care products manufacturer. The illumination is done under the theme of Swadeshi Khomba Aloka Puja Sathkaraya.
The ongoing events began on July 13 and ended on July 27. The Swadeshi sponsored the Aloka Pooja for the 17th consecutive time. Swadeshi Chairperson Amari Wijewardene emphasises it is the fervent duty of any Sri Lankan company to safeguard the culture and traditional heritage by supporting activities.
Swadeshi Deputy Chairperson Chulodhara Samarasinghe explained that illuminating the places of worship is for the benefit of all worshippers plus educating the younger generation on the importance of safeguarding the country’s heritage. The illumination is followed by a colourful cultural pageant which highlights Sri Lankan traditions and history.
According to the Mahavamsa, Kiri Vehera was built by King Mahanaga in a commemoration of the Buddha’s visit to Kataragama Kihiri Uyana to deliver Dharma during his third visit to Sri Lanka.
The Kataragama Devalaya was built by King Dutugemunu as a fulfilment of a vow made to safeguard the national interests of Sri Lanka. The Lord Kataragama is worshipped by people of different races and religions not only in Sri Lanka but also in various parts of the world.
