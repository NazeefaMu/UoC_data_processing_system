Laboratory for  Chefs and Foodies

Sri Lanka’s first-ever Food Atrium, set to open on September 19 at Colombo’s City Centre, is a place for chefs to grow and foodies to indulge, making fine-dining accessible to more people in Colombo.
On a Tuesday afternoon, more than 80 children from the Warehouse Project and the Sri Jinananda Children’s Home ascended the service elevator of Colombo’s unfinished City Centre. They reached the third floor, where Sri Lanka’s first ever Food Atrium was being unveiled, and offered a sampling of the Atrium’s vast menu: fresh plates of dumplings, samosas, Singaporean chicken rice, and large bowls of creamy gelato.
On a picturesque perch overlooking Gangaramaya park and Seema Malakaya temple, the Food Atrium is decorated with wicker chairs, wooden benches, and pear-shaped lanterns that contrast high, industrial ceilings. It opens out onto a terrace with panoramic views of the city, unmatched by most of Colombos’ restaurants. The walls are painted with rainforests and gems by local artisans, said Lim Tai Toon, Chairman of Food Studio, which finances the Food Atrium, and the furniture is designed by local craftsman too. “But nothing too traditional,” says Toon, “[these are] Sri Lankan concepts in a modern setting.”
The Food Atrium is no ordinary food court. “There’s no difference in terms of schematics,” said Toon,“but in terms of the principle behind the product, it’s a huge difference,” the principle being the quality of food the Food Atrium serves. One indication of the Food Atrium’s principles is its Chairman, Mr. Toon himself, a co-founder of BreadTalk. Toon refuses to acquiesce food-quality for convenience, and takes a hands-on approach to managing the Food Atrium’s restaurants: “I have the right,” he says “[to] insist on the quality of the food [a chef] is serving, and at the same time to dictate the menu he serves.” During a food-tasting on the Atrium’s launch, Toon made notes on the temperature of each dish, its presentation, the quality of the meats, and the sauces that came with each dish. “The ability to cook is, for us, very critical,” he says. Toon makes sure that “no stall serves the food of another stall,” and refers to this replication as “food cannibalism,” and so his Atrium serves up at least nine different types of cuisine: Japanese, Indonesian, Singaporean, Sri Lankan, Malaysian, Chinese, Indian, Portuguese, and Balkan food.

Another way that the Food Atrium distinguishes itself from any typical food court is its business plan. Rather than renting out space to different chain restaurants, Toon handpicks the chefs and food for the Atrium, and collects a percentage of the restaurant’s sales. In this way, Food Studio ties its success to the success of their restaurants. Most of the restaurants in the Food Atrium are obscure, and the establishments are family-run, and Toon notes the “Midah Sisters” restaurant, run by the Wong sisters. The sisters apparently up and quit their jobs to pursue their passion for Singaporean snacks, and specialise in a sumptuous Singaporean Curry Puff, and tender Teppanyaki beef. Toon says that the logo of the restaurant, a modest two storey house, is actually a sketch of the Wongs’ childhood home in Malaysia.

These local chefs use the Food Atrium as a launching pad for their businesses, and a number of Food Studio’s restaurant-tenants have now become major franchises. “I’m proud to say that some of our tenants, quite a number of our tenants, started with one stall,” said toon, offering the example of a husband and wife team in Singapore. “A wife was cooking some Biryani way back in 1999. Today, the husband and wife team, they have 17 restaurants in Singapore This kind of community development is what we hope to bring,” to Colombo, says Toon.
Toon described the long (and delicious) process of determining which chefs and restaurants to choose for the Atrium. “We need to test the food. We see how they make the food,” and goes through a careful process of selection to determine which chefs and foods to feature at the Atrium. “There’s a lot of eating involved,” said Food Studio Director Nadeem Rajabdeen describing what it was like to test the Sri Lankan food chefs they chose for Food Atrium. “We literally went to taste it in their house,” at least three times, “and they cooked unbelievable food.” The Sri Lankan restaurant, Okra Kitchen, is run by a husband and wife team, Ravi and Sepali, whose son won Sri Lanka’s first Michelin Star and currently works at the restaurant Botanik. Rajabdeen says they cooked Sri Lankan food, “but there is like stuffed cuddle-fish with fish sambol… all Sri Lankan food but with fresh ingredients.”
Food Studio chooses chefs who make a great product, but may struggle with the branding and business of selling them. And that’s precisely the role ofthe Food Atrium, says Toon, to manage the business and branding efforts for the restaurants, “so that they can focus on cooking.”
