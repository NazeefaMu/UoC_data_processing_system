Ordeal in Malaysia

Ever since Kumara Dissanayake (31) returned from his job in Malaysia, he has had memory problems and mild mental retardation. His family claimed that this was not the same ‘Kumara’ who went to work abroad.
Pitigala Mudiyanselage Dharshana Kumara Dissanayake, a resident of Yaddhessawa, Atharagalla, Galgamuwa, flew to Malaysia with aspirations of creating a better life for his wife and his little eight-month-old child.

The plight he faced in Malaysia came to light only a few months after he returned home. His family members lamented that they began to see significant differences in Kumara in every way.
There was a cut on his head and it was clear that some sort of surgery had been performed on him and as a result he had lost much of his memory, except for being able to recall a few major incidents.
In March 2016, Kumara went to Malaysia to work at a house, but due to some issues in his passport, he had to return to Sri Lanka in June 2016.
After spending two days in the country, he left to Malaysia again, to the same house, using the tickets he had.
Mystery in Malaysia
“It has been five months since I got back to Sri Lanka. My memory fails me every day. Therefore, with whatever my wife tells me, I figure out what has happened in my life. I do not remember what happened to me after I left for Malaysia for the second time. But when I was there, I have had situations where I would feel that I had woken up from a deep and long sleep.
One day, when I opened my eyes, I was inside four glass walls and it looked more like a hospital. Then my head started to hurt and it became unbearable,” he explained.
He said a short while after he became conscious, his employers had visited.
“They told me that I had fainted and that they had immediately admitted me to the hospital. They further assured me that I was doing well and said that we could go home now.
Later I remember them taking me home. I do not remember anything that happened afterwards,” he said.
Kumara does not remember who brought him back to Sri Lanka. He is aware that some person accompanied him to the airport but does not remember who it was.
“As far as I remember, afterwards another man took me to the airport in Malaysia. He kept a folded white sheet in my hands and put my passport in the pocket, tapped my shoulders and said that we could go home now.
Then I remember getting on the plane. Yet, I do not remember what happened till I got down in Sri Lanka.
When I got back to Sri Lanka, I could not even recognize my parents and siblings. It was after an operation at the hospital here that I have this memory power. There was a hole cut in my head and that is very visible,” he said.
V.A.P. Susilavathi (51), Kumara’s mother, understandably, has been very disturbed by the whole incident.
“Kumara is my oldest son. The stability in the house is lost due to my son’s situation. All what we need is to cure my son. When he went to Malaysia for the first time, he sent us money and spoke well. After he went for the second time, he only spoke to us for about a month and assured us that he was doing well,” she said.
Susilavathi said that there was no news from her son for more than a year and she did not know what had happened to him until he was found in town.
Kumara returns
“Then for about a year or two, there was no news about him. Though the number he was using there was working, nobody answered the call. Until my son returned home, we did not know where he was. He was wearing torn clothes when he returned, he was not in his senses. His beard and hair were overgrown and we could not recognize him. He did not speak a word and did not remember what happened to him. Then we took him to a hospital here,” she explained.
P.M Dissanayake, his father, said he prayed that the tragedy which befell Kumara would not happen to anyone else.
“The man who went to work returned losing his memory. Now he is recovering, thanks to God. When we inquired what happen, we found that some person had brought him to Sri Lanka.
They had taken the train to Ambanpola from Colombo. One of our local authority councillors identified him while he was roaming around the railway station and shops in Ambanpola. Yet, we could not get any information from my son in that situation. It was with great suspicion that we brought him home, because even we could not recognize him,” he said.
He said that doctors revealed that his head had been cut and improperly stitched.
“When we took him to the Thambuththegama hospital, they said that my son’s situation was serious and he was transferred to the Anuradhapura Teaching Hospital. Tests conducted revealed that his head had been cut and the stitches were improperly placed. The doctors said that an operation needs to be done in two days or my son’s life would be in danger. But we could not afford to collect Rs 50,000 at that time. Then they sent him to the Colombo National Hospital and the surgery was done. He is recovering now. He still hasn’t got his full memory, but is improving,” he said.
Dissanayake said that doctors had said that they needed Rs 300,000 to do the second operation. “My wife and I cannot find that amount to conduct the operation. We are into agriculture and we do not earn a huge profit,” he said. “When some incidents appear on my mind, I cry aloud and scream. I am helpless today,” Kumara said.
Further, according to Kumara, his passport too had been altered.
“When I left for Malaysia, I had a passport valid for 10 years, but the passport that I used to return has been issued on January 24, 2017 with expiry on April 24, 2017,” he said. Further, the picture on the passport was not of him and it had been replaced with another.
Kumara said his employers in Malaysia had taken all his documents including his certificates, receipt issued by the agency and his identity card. Due to these incidents which occurred over a short period of his life, Kumara lamented that he felt like a mentally retarded person. “My wife said that one day when she called my number, a woman had answered the phone and said that I was dead and cremated there. She was sure that the woman who spoke on the phone was a Sinhalese person,” he said.
The mystery of what happened to Kumara Dissanayake in Malaysia continues with very little hope of finding who is responsible. Kumara, in the meantime, is worried that his family was suffering because of him. “The breadwinner is now a burden,” he said.
