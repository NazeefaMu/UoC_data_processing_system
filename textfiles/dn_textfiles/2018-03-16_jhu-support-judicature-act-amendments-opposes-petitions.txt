JHU support for Judicature Act amendments, opposes petitions

Jathika Hela Urumaya (JHU) will appear before court as an intervening party to oppose petitions filed by various groups challenging the bill entitled Judicature (Amendment), JHU Leader Megalopolis and Western Development Minister Patali Champika Ranawaka said.
The Minister said several petitions have been filed by various groups challenging the proposed amendment to the Judicature Act No. 2 of 1978, presented by Justice Minister Thalatha Athukorala.
He was addressing the media yesterday at the JHU office in Battaramulla.The petitions filed by various groups including the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna challenging the proposed amendment to the Judicature Act will be taken up for hearing in Court today.
“As a political party against fraud and corruption, we have decided to intervene to oppose the petitions in order to protect the Act,” Minister said.
The proposed amendment to the Judicature Act No. 2 of 1978, once enacted into law will enable the Attorney General to directly forward cases to the Special High Court comprising three judges. This Act will help to accelerate the hearing of cases filed against persons with corruption charges of both ruling party as well as the previous regime.
The Minister said this decision could have been taken soon after forming the yahapalana regime to fulfill the wishes of majority of Sri Lankans who voted for the President.
“Not only the independence of the judiciary but also the impartiality and accuracy in judicial decisions and the adaptation of modern technology when taking decisions are important to ensure a reliable and credible justice system,” the Minister stressed.
Deputy Minister Karu Paranawithana was present.
