UNP to consider Tissa’s request to re-join party: Kabir

United National Party (UNP) General Secretary Kabir Hashim yesterday said the Party would consider any requests made by former UNP General Secretary Tissa Attanayake to re-join the party.
“Given our political culture in the past, many switched from one party to another. Some came back to our fold, some left and some did both on many an occasion. This is nothing new,” he said, addressing a media briefing at Sirikotha and added that anyone could join the UNP.
“Let him make a request,”Hashim said.
In 2015,the UNP Working Committee made the decision to expel Attanayake from the party over the alleged forging of signatures of the President and Prime Minister in a document during the last Presidential election.
