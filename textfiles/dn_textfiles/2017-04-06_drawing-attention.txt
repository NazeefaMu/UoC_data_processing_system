Drawing attention

Versatile can be the other name for Narmada Bharathi. This 11 year old small town girl has shown prowess in a variety of fields. Be it drawing, Bharatanatyam dancing, creative writing, acting or singing, her passion is unbounded.
Gifted with a flair for drawing, she recently won a belt and certificate for the best leader of the year in a competition organized by the Colombo Children’s Book Society. She also bagged a bronze medal and certificate of achievement for a drawing she submitted to the art competition conducted by the Kumamoto UNESCO Association. Narmada had done a drawing of an eco friendly city under the category of ‘My beautiful city’ for the competition.
The student of Swarnamali Girls’ College, Kandy, says that if she was given a choice to excel in only one aesthetic activity she has shown a flair for, she would choose creative writing.
“That is because through creative writing I can communicate with people through words without a limited space. Aesthetic activities do not restrict you. They know no prejudice. They helps us become ourselves rather than make us carbon copies of one another,” Narmada opined.
She notes that her talent for art emerged out of the blue. It did not come out to the spotlight till she was around six years old. Her mother noticed the little girl dabbling with her coloured pencils and saw her skills for the subject making an appearance on her drawing books. Soon Narmada had a fan base with her grandparents joining in and encouraging her to fine tune her artistry.
Though she uses a variety of media in her art, she says that she prefers to draw mainly using watercolours and acrylics. She does mostly nature and expressional drawings. The first time she scored in art was at the Homerun Pas ‘Varna Mangalya’ art competition held in 2009. She won third place at the event. Since they were not given a topic for the event Narmada has drawn a picture of herself with her grandparents and two elephants using crayons.
“My grandparents are close to my heart. That is why I chose to draw them with me and the elephants. I am sure my grandfather would have been thrilled with my achievements if he had been alive today,” Narmada said with a note of sadness.
Another art competition she has excelled in recently was winning a gold medal at the Kshitij International Art Competition which was held towards the end of 2016. It was conducted by India and she had submitted a drawing of a pottery shop for the event.
Queried on what is the most memorable moment in her artistic stint Narmada says that the NSB ‘Patha Patha Hapankam’ all island art competition she took part in was a milestone for her.
“It was my first all island art competition in which I drew at the venue itself rather than submit my work for a competition. It was held in 2015. I won the central province first place and later the all island first place. I did not know that it has clinched the all island first place till the last stages of the event. That drawing was used for the NSB desk calendar as well,” Narmada expressed.
She had also taken part in the Literacy Development Project Workshop in Sri Lanka in their 33rd annual training course. The event was organized by the Colombo Children’s Book Society which was founded by Dr Dhammadesha Ambalampitiya. The society has 12 programs each moth every year. The Literacy Development Project Workshop and Leadership Training Workshop are included in their annual calendar. Narmada submitted two works: a poetry book titled ‘A Poem in My Mind’ and a story book titled ‘Sudu Nendage Sudu Puta’ at the end of the event which was held at the Department of National Archives. Both books were chosen as worthy material for publication though no one had yet stepped up to help fund the printing procedure.
She has taken part in another program put together by the Colombo Children’s Book Society - an All Island Summer Camp. It was held in April 2016 and marked its 32rd chapter that year. The Education Ministry and Defense Ministry too have been roped in for the event. Each participant had been put in groups with houses named after famous authors. Then they were asked to make fact files about the author. A general knowledge test too had been a part of the program. Narmada had enjoyed the whole experience thoroughly because it had given her the perfect excuse to indulge in her passions. Narmada aims to become a surgeon, a lawyer, or an English lecturer. She encourages other youth to venture forward without hesitation.
“You might fail but do not take this as a discouragement. True, there are potholes and pitfalls in life but there are also heartwarming moments and success. Your victory becomes sweeter when you have strived hard to achieve your goal,” she said.
