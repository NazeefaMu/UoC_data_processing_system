Lanka, Thailand aim for ambitious trade surge to US$1.5 bn

Sri Lanka and Thailand have come to a consensus on a FTA for trade in goods as the first step before a comprehensive FTA that will follow.
Thailand has proposed an MOU on a strategic economic partnership (SEP) with Sri Lanka as a stepping stone, on June 2, in Bangkok.
The latest breakthrough in Sri Lanka–Thai trade is reported from the ‘Second Sub Committee Meeting on Trade-Related Matters’ between the higher level trade officials of both countries held in Bangkok on June 2.
The bilateral meeting was held at Eastin Grand Hotel, Sathorn, Bangkok.
The Thai delegation was led by Director-General of Thailand’s Department of Trade Negotiations Boonyarit Kalayanamit, while the Sri Lankan side was led by Director General of Commerce of Sri Lanka Sonali Wijeratne.
While exchanging views on trade and economic situations of both countries, the two parties expressed their interest to further enhance their trade and achieve the targets set by the leaders of the two countries to reach total trade to US$ 1.5 billion by 2020. Current annual trade levels between Thailand and Sri Lanka is in the range of US$ 550 million.
To achieve the US$ 1.5 billion trade objective, it was agreed to explore the possibilities of establishment of the bilateral Free Trade Agreement (FTA), and developing the SEP between Thailand and Sri Lanka in identified sectors of mutual interests.
Under the proposed FTA, it was considered to explore the possibility of the establishing an FTA on Trade in Goods as the first step towards a comprehensive FTA with the offer lists under the BIMSTEC to be considered as the basis for the FTA negotiation on the goods under the Enabling Clause of the WTO.
The Thai side submitted a draft MOU on Economic Strategic Partnership to Sri Lanka for consideration for which both sides exchanged views, and Sri Lanka suggested some additions and an action plan.
The MOU is expected to be concluded with an action plan in order to be signed during Thai Deputy Prime Minister Somkid Jatusripitak’s visit to the island in August 2017.
Both sides also discussed areas such as basic infrastructure in Sri Lanka, food preservation and food processing industry, gems and jewellery industry, tourism and hospitality industry, export credit line, small and medium enterprises, agricultural products, floriculture, tea, automobile component manufactures, electronics and electrical sector, trade fair participation, capacity building, quarantine clearance to export of fresh strawberries to Thailand, and long processing time in the issuance of business visa to Sri Lankan exporters.
