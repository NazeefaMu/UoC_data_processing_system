Why Thomas Hardy’s Angel Clare is the Worst

Reading a novel is an affair of the heart. And like most confirmed bookworms, my relationship to a book is textured by emotional attachment to its characters. Some—Jane Eyre, Maggie Tulliver—summon my affection like old chums. Fitzwilliam Darcy? What can I say—an epidemic crush always possesses some widespread appeal (it is a truth universally acknowledged, and so forth). And yet, my most passionate literary relationship is characterized neither by empathy nor by romantic whimsy. I’m instead most preoccupied by an almost lunatic animosity for a single—irredeemably wretched—fictional man.
Incandescent goodness
Thomas Hardy, born on this day in 1840, introduced me to the object of my devoted loathing when I first read his 1891 novel Tess of the D’Urbervilles.
I consider Hardy one of my favorite writers and count the book among those most beloved to me. Each time I weep for Tess Durbeyfield because her incandescent goodness finds no sanctuary in Hardy’s indifferent universe—and because she has the misfortune to become entangled with one despicable Angel Clare. Dear readers, I fucking hate that guy.
If you’ve also read the novel and share my staunch loyalty to Tess, I suspect your own estimation of Angel Clare is none too lofty. After all, nearly every misery Tess encounters results, if not from cruel happenstance, others’ vanities and caprices.
Wealthy family
After her drunkard father, John Durbeyfield, learns that his family is descended from the great English family D’Urberville—now all but extinct—he and his wife, a similarly callow person, send Tess to claim kinship with the last of their wealthy family.
On this errand, which Tess is mortified to perform, she encounters Alec D’Urberville, a mustachioed villain who would be comical if his lust were not so dangerous. After raping Tess, she lives unwillingly as his companion until, utterly unable to bear it, she abandons him, returns home, and delivers his illegitimate child—a boy called Sorrow, named deliberately by his mother before he dies in infancy.
Tess meets Angel a few years later while working as a milkmaid, and though their attraction is potent and mutual, she fears taking a husband when, according to Victorian morality, her virtue has been blemished. Yet she finally yields to him, too in love to deny herself the first ardent joy she has known. And for a fleeting moment, she believes that she is delivered—that she has emerged, finally, from the shadow of her past.
On the night of their wedding, Angel confesses to Tess that, years ago, he had an affair in London. In turn, Tess readily confides her history with D’Urberville, believing—appropriately but naively—that Angel could not possibly fault her when her “sin” matches his own. But he does.
Platonic ideal
Nineteenth century misogyny teaches Tess that she bears the brunt of D’Urberville’s shame, and so she equates rape with Angel’s willful dalliance. But Angel’s perspective is further mangled—not merely by social mores, but also by his warped mythology of women. For he has come to love Tess as a platonic ideal—she is not merely a woman, but burdened with the mantle of idealized virginity. After learning that his new wife is not an untouched nature goddess he pronounces Tess “dead” and abandons her. “Forgiveness does not apply to the case,” Angel declares, as Tess begs for her new husband’s pity. “You were one person; now you are another…the woman I have been loving is not you.”
Perhaps, after following my account this far, you’ve already raised a skeptical eyebrow. To be sure, Angel is a feckless hypocrite, but what about Alec D’Urberville, Tess’s rapist—a man who ravages the Wessex countryside in search of fresh, naïve prey, and who wields his influence to indulge his obsession with Tess. I don’t deny Alec’s villainy: he is one grotesque and immediate cause of Tess’s bevy of misfortunes. - Lit Hub
