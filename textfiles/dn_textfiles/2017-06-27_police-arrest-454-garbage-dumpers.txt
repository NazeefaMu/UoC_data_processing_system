Police arrest 454 garbage dumpers

The Police in a three-day joint operation with the Army have arrested 454 errant individuals dumping garbage at various locations within the Western Province.
“The Police will file legal action against the individuals arrested for illegal garbage dumping. The respective Police stations where the individuals were arrested will carry out this process,” a statement by the Police Media Spokesman’s Office said.
“The raids to nab errant garbage dumpers will continue,” the Police further said.
The three day raid according to the Police had been conducted from June 21 to June 23 covering nine police divisions.
According to the Police, 95 individuals had been arrested from the Gampaha Police Division, 68 from Colombo Central, 57 - Colombo North, 56- Kelaniya, 53 - Panadura, 53 - Nugegoda, 33- Colombo South, 30 - Negombo, and 9 from Mount Lavinia.
The Local Government authorities no longer collect garbage that is not segregated. According to a Colombo Municipal Council official, most of the illegal garbage dumpers are those who don’t segregate their waste.
