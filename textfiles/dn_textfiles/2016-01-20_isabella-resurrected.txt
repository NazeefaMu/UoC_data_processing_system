ISABELLA RESURRECTED

Two combined verses from his 1818 long poem, Isabella (or the Pot of Basil), a robust tragedy spiced in romance and death, laid upon a helpless, beautiful girl who is at the mercy of her two brothers. The story has high quality value, seeped in romance, death, and cold-blooded murder. It is a remarkable story of passion and compassion but Keats fail to rise to its depth. The verses are filled with unwarranted melancholy and stero-type, run-on-the-mill poetry. It is sad that he failed to draw out the essence, the aura that surrounds the subject. Compared to Keats' ENDYMION, Isabella takes a back seat with so much potential that has gone untapped. Given to Shakespeare, Isabella could have been dialogued to such scaling heights with a spectacular, rise, that Isabella would have been among his top tragedies.
It was a vision... In the drowsy gloom
The dull of midnight, at her couch's foot.
Lorenzo stood, and wept; the forest tomb
Had marr'd his glossy hair which one could shoot
Lustre into the sun and put cold doom
Upon his lips, and taken the soft lute
From his lorn voice and passed his loamed ears
Had made a miry channel his tears.....
Keats has failed to seize the significance of his own story and build around it a glorious episode. Instead, his mile long stanzas are painful to read and if the reader was not updated with the story, he would have felt reading nonsense.
In fairness to Keats, we must realize that he never wrote a play rather a narrated story stat would have been better written to a tale rather than a poem. May be he was intent conveying the poem into a poetic play but it never happened. When the poem was published, it met with a lashing from some while others saw a glint of hope in the flagging poetry scene. This tale was praised by Charles Lamb but in 1853, Mathew Arnold pitched it for criticism. But later, the reader was given the option to decide to himself on a comparison with his ISABELLA as with A SICLLIAN STORY, written by his friend, Barry Cornwall in a version of modern refinement. It was conceived with love and misery of Isabella.
Yet the question remain:- Why did it have to trail behind ENDYMION ? or for that matter, why did Keats have to trail behind Wordsworth? Keats confined himself to his own art of writing and drew heavily upon archaic and pseudo English that produced a sense of public disgust not so much for Isabella but in general. By this time, poetry readers were tired of antiquity and were looking for robust Romanticism and his style was static where certain spellings could have been removed. I am not a great poet to sit in judgment on Keats but taking for granted that poets such as Shelley, Coleridge, Milton, Wordsworth; Robert Browning and lesser known English poets who had left him behind in spite of his spectacular ENDYMION and the rest. However ENDYMION was the target for the criticism against Keats but later, one critic asserted it on the failure of those critics to understand the beauty and meaning left behind this literary saga even after his death.
Keats opted to dream a story to evolve around Isabella but came up with a long poem instead and originally titled The Pot Of Basil derived in turn from the narrative in Baccaccio's THE DECAMERON. The love story trend into a tragedy; a gruesome murder where Isabella becomes the innocent victim. Lorenzo visits her in a dream and tells her where his body lies so that she could exhume it and hold unto her heart in a bottle of basil where later, the brothers discover it only to destroy what she obsessively possessed whereupon she pines and dies.
ISABELLA RESURRECTED Keats died in 1821 and Frank Bridge in 1879, fifty eight years later. Bridge was to resurrect Isabella as well as Keats to phenomenal heights of fame and popularity. Keats was buried after casts of his head, hand and foot were taken before his body was interred in the Protestant Cemetery according to his wishes where violets grew and wrote his own elegy. Bridge was the Messiah for the awakening of Isabella in symphony.
I attended this massive orchestration in September, 2011 at the Royal Albert Hall by the BBC symphony Orchestra with the rare notation by Frank Bridge whose music had been a regular feature at the RAH.
Bridge had been only 27 years old when he scored Isabella after its tone-poem inspired by the most horrible, gruesome story of the innocent eponymous heroine whose brothers kill her lover, Lorenzo and who visits her in a dream and inform her whereabouts his body is. Isabella finds the grave, cuts off his head and conceal it in a pot of basil. Later the brothers discover, it, steal, and destroy the head and whereupon, she pines and dies. Great was her love for Lorenzo.
Bridge completed the score of Isabella of 1907 and was his most effective orchestral work. It established him as recognized individual music voice. The symphony was conducted by Sir Henry Wood and was a smashing success. In 1935, The BBC Orchestra played the score with Bridge conducting for the first time.
The grisly story related in John Keats' Isabella (or POT OF BASIL) was derived from a narrative, THE DECAMERON. No other work by Bridge follows a literary programme so closely as this poem.
The composer had segement the score into four division in order to retain the elements of sadness, horror and love tragedy. It is a simple diatonic melody which reflects Isabella's bold character as suggested by Keats.
Apparently Bridge had studied Liszt's symphonic poems as well as Tchaikovsky's Romeo and Juliet, and perhaps some of Richard Strauss's essays in genre.
But the radient orchestral outpourings that Bridge combined Lorenzo's and Isabella' theme pointed forward to his maturity in mixing tone poems in symphonic scores, to outshine many who tried to follow him.
Thus Isabella remain resurrected.
