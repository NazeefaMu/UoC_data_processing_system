CA Sri Lanka honours four founding  members for outstanding leadership

The Institute of Chartered Accountants of Sri Lanka (CA Sri Lanka) recently paid tribute to four founding members of the institute, who during their lifetime gave leadership towards developing the accounting profession, almost six decades ago.
At a ceremony held recently, the institute’s founding President L.A. Weerasinghe, the institute’s first elected President K Satchithananda, and founding council members R.S. Wijeyesekera, and M.T.L. Fernando, were posthumously inducting to the CA Sri Lanka Hall of Fame.
The four founding members were inducted to the Hall of Fame in recognition of their outstanding contribution and for giving leadership in developing the profession and the institute, during the first decade since the institute was founded in 1959.
Speaking at the event, incumbent President of CA Sri Lanka Lasantha Wickremasinghe said the institute boasts of a proud history dating back to nearly six decades, and the institute stands tall today because of the vision, direction and hard work by the founding fathers of the institute.
“This year, the CA Sri Lanka Council decided to pay tribute to our founding fathers, posthumously, by inducting them to the CA Sri Lanka Hall of Fame in recognition of the significant role they played during their lifetime, in developing the accounting profession in Sri Lanka,” he said.
