Youth attacked by bear hospitalised

A youth who had sustained serious injuries all over his body after escaping from the clutches of a she bear which attacked him in the Wilpattu National park was admitted to the Anuradhapura Hospital recently.
The she bear had attacked him when he went into the forest with three other friends to pluck ‘Palu’ and ‘Weera’ fruits.
Hospital sources said the youth who had gaping wounds in head, stomach and hands was subjected to a surgery.
