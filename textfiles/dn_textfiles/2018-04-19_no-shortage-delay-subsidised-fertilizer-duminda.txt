No shortage, delay of subsidised fertilizer - Duminda

Agriculture Minister Duminda Dissanayake yesterday assured that the government has already taken measures to provide subsidised fertilizer to farmers without a shortage or any delay.
Addressing the media yesterday at the Agriculture Ministry, Minister Dissanayake said that a circular mentioning the fertilizer distribution procedure has already been issued to all Agrarian Services Centres and agricultural officers at the grassroots level.
According to the Minister, a 50 kg bag of fertilizer will be sold to paddy farmers at Rs. 500 and the fertilizer will be issued through Agrarian Services Centres.
A bag of fertilizer for farmers who grow other crops including fruits, vegetables, tea and rubber will be sold at Rs.1,500. But they cannot purchase fertilizer only through the private sector and not through the Agrarian Services Centres.
Minister urged the public to make complaints about any sale of fertilizers, urea, TSP, MOP and sulphate of ammonia at a price higher than the subsidised price of Rs. 1,500, via hotline 0113 036666.
A team of officials headed by the Secretary to the State Minister of Agriculture has been appointed to take decisions related to next cultivation season and the dates of supplying water and fertilizers.
According to the Minister, measures have already been taken to supply required fertilizer stocks to the stores at Nikaweratiya, Galenbidunuwewa, Murukkan, Hanguranketha, Niyagama, Medirigiriya, Buttala and Bakamuna.
