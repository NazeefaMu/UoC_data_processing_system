We will form stable government - Ranil

United National Party (UNP) Leader and former Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said the first priority of the Party now was to form a legitimate and stable Government.
He was addressing those who had come to Temple Trees to wish him well after the Supreme Court verdict invalidating the Special Gazette notification of President Maithripala Sirisena yesterday evening.
Wickremesinghe said: “We very much value the decision of the Supreme Court judgement delivered where it has upheld the supremacy of the legislative body. We will now concentrate in forming a very strong and legitimate government. We have the necessary majority in Parliament to do so. We will all be united to form a stable government to resolve pressing problems of our people,” he said.
