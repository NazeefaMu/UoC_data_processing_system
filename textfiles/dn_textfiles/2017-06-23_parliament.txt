Debate on SAITM issue postponed

He said the Joint Opposition members discussed the matter on Wednesday evening and needed to debate the matter in Parliament.

The debate on the Notification under the Excise Ordinance came to an end at 4 pm and presiding member Ananda Kumarasiri called to move the adjournment motion. As the member to move the adjournment motion was not present in the House, sittings postponed for today.
Anura Kumara points out conflict of interest:
Aligayawanna called on to step down from one of his portfolios
There is a conflict of interest in Finance and Mass Media Deputy Minister Lasantha Alagiyawanna holding the Chairmanship of Committee on Public Accounts, Chief Opposition Whip and JVP Leader Anura Kumara Dissanayake said.
Speaking at the debate in Parliament yesterday he requested Alagiyawanna to step down from either of his portfolios. He said there were clear discrepancies in the Finance Ministry records and he called on the COPA to look into the Ministry records, particularly the 2016 annual report.
MP Dissanayake demanded Alagiyawanna to decide between the two portfolios as it was a conflict of interest to hold both. The MP said the National Lotteries Board Act clearly indicates that it should be under the Finance Ministry, and therefore handing it over to the Foreign Ministry without amending the Act is a clear violation of the law.
He requested the attention of the President and the Prime Minister to the matter.
COPA report No. 2 to be presented today
The Committee on Public Accounts (COPA) will present its second report to Parliament today.
It comprises findings on 31 public institutions including three special investigations carried out between May and October, 2016.
On behalf of the Committee, its Chairman Lasantha Alagiyawanna will table the report at the commencement of sittings today. The COPA presented its first report to the 8th Parliament in September last year.
