All down to fitness and patience...the hottest league season by far

In all things rugby.... considerations and focus shift to survival and fitness in the Singer league.
There has been hardly any love lost between the major contenders.
Royal have weathered it all with customary patience and solid performance from the start...most pleasingly, it’s the manner in which they handle and absorb pressure that sets them apart.
What a grand treat for all rugby hearts both at home and across both hemispheres.
Sri Lankan islanders by nature, are colourful souls ...and serious about their cricket, rugby, and all things F&B.
So naturally, whatever part of globe, match schedules are precious occasions for sharing.
Take the schools tournament so far ...the burners ...who will challenge Royal..?
Will Peter’s have the firepower, and match the inform boiler house 8..? Can Joseph’s turn this league on its head ...especially if Patana and their green machine, pressure keg Royal into mistakes? Then somehow craft a big W, when they meet?
What a mind boggling finish that would be in sunny Sri.....certainly a day like no other.
Peter’s are recovering from the long trip to that Lions den last week...and grateful for the 28 hard points that Trinity just failed to better.
If Martis was happy with that performance, is a matter for closer and more specific scrutiny by all the experts ...self appointed or not?
The script for Royal v Peters is a real cracker and not for anyone with a weak constitution or lack of patience.
Both coaches know each other max....so for Lewke to outwit or outsmart Martis will take some doing.
But that is only one humble thought ....despite the pundits and rugby intellectuals striding our turf.
A thought that might well change the course and strategy of the 70mins in the middle.
To consider the possibilities of Joseph’s and Peter’s is harsh on what might be expectations...as anything is possible and no fixed assurances written in stone.
Let’s bite our lips and simply...look forward to the matches.
The results certainly matter….and are huge impediments in the players mind ...affecting his thinking and sense of being.
Players need max protection from game stress, and should as part of team wellness, be shielded from the .... ‘must win ambassadors’ who do more damage than good.
Sensible to prep players how to tune out, be calm and step up at the right moment, both mentally and physically.
The bodyclock theory in terms of getting ready for the match ....is an absolute.
Do the normal things, the simple daily routine that one follows...food time and habits must not change.....if you tolerate that change...you are inviting stress and more.
This little change starts adding up during your day...and will out during warm up or worse ....during game time.
Fundamentals must be jealously guarded and policed as part of team planning.
Club and international 7s emerge from their specified slumber...with the club’s lining up the best available in June...and subsequently selection options for the national squad.
Plenty in that 7s basket...with club, Mercantile, international locally...then regional with the Asian series and this year the Asian Games for a true test of skills and quality.
Our islanders will need maximum strength, fitness, skills, courage, mindset for pain and hearts that crave the impossible...
Players are expected to think and behave like true warriors...as 7s is the hardest game in the known world.
For those who have played the almighty 15mins in the middle, will understand the pressure to finish and how lung busting to cover tackle 35m across the park, pick up loose ball in your own 22m...then motor up 80m to corner flag the winning try with a minute left to play!
I can taste the endorphin adrenaline as I remember with mixed emotions...and more the heart pounding a perfect reminder.
The mind’s eye ...exhilarating and intimidated, all in the same breath.
What a fabulous feeling indeed.
Let’s wish the selectors and their deliberations, much success.
Then hope the players like Danushka Ranjan, Srinath Sooriyabandara, Williwera, Jason D, Ritchie Dharmap, Muthuthanthri, and some inspiration impact forwards to step up this international spell till November.
Blessings for good rehabilitation and stronger minds.
May the Sri islanders force be with them Bula bula Sri api!
