Designer divas!

Intex South Asia 2018, the largest International Textile Sourcing Show of South Asia was held recently at the BMICH. This event showcases the best in yarns, fabrics (apparel and denim), clothing accessories and allied services from across Asia and the world. The Show provides access into South Asia, which is not only the second largest garment manufacturing and exporting region in the world but also has a massive domestic market spurred by South Asia’s 487 million fashion conscious youth with increasing disposable income and spending power. Here are some models who showcased the latest designs on the catwalk. Pictures by Vipula Amarasinghe
