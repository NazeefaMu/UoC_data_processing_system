Mullaitivu sea area normal says NARA

National Aquatic Resources Development Agency (NARA) has dispatched a team of officials to observe the sea off Mullaitivu following some media reports published on Tuesday claiming that an abnormal condition developed in the sea area off Mullaitivu.
Paying his immediate attention on these media reports, Fisheries and Aquatic Resources Development Minister Mahinda Amaraweera instructed NARA authorities to find out the development of any abnormal condition in the sea.
The Meteorology Department has confirmed that there is no any abnormal weather condition developed in the sea area off Mullaitivu.
There’s no need for alarm over the presence of jelly fish as reported along Mullaitivu beach since it is a normal condition which was resulted due to sea temperature variations, surges or abundance of food for fish near beaches.
