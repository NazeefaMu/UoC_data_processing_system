Happy to have  changed electoral  process - Musthapha

Provincial Councils and Local Government Minister Faiszer Mustapha said he was happy to have changed the corrupt electoral process.
Speaking to the media yesterday he said he received the blessings of President Maithripala Sirisena and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe.
“I was able to change this corrupt electoral process with great difficulty.I am thankful to the Provincial Councils and Local Government Ministry Secretary, cabinet ministers, Chairman of the Election Commission and the delimitation committee who helped me to succeed in this endeavour and those who encouraged me by their criticisms. I respectfully thank everyone who gave me the strength in this process. Everyone was a source of strength to me. I did all of these for the people of country. Because of my actions today, I believe that in the future we will have an intelligent political generation. Especially, we have achieved a big victory in introducing 25% women’s representation. I believe that where there are women present, the opportunities for corruption will be reduced.”
“With the introduction of 25% women’s representation, the voice of women in parliament will increase and we can expect a new political culture where morality and justice will prevail,”he said.
