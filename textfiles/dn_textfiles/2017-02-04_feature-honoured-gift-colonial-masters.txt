FEATURE: Honoured gift from the colonial masters

Going back to its beginnings in the pre independence era, it will be of immense use to know the historical background that led to the emergence of the most prestigious institution, the University of Ceylon, Peradeniya, noted for its historic glory and cultural heritage. It will be of great importance to the past as well as the present generation of undergrads to go back to the scenario that brought about the origin of this unique institution. It rich historic legacy is keenly felt even today, in its atmosphere as a worthy institution which has a surprising way of living for decades as it was originally created. Its stature possesses such power that any passer-by or any fresher (new) student might want to delve deep into the past to its origin. The honour of preserving it to-date is taken over by the time factor and the mighty tradition.
One could say that the University was an outcome of imperialism which we experienced till we gained independence. University education in its initial stages was mostly governed by political considerations during early colonial rule. The education policy then was determined according to the financial resources of the colony and the creation of a University was not given attention until after they stabilized their power in the island (than Ceylon). The need for a University arose much later. The Colombo Academy, which was created in 1853, affiliated to the University of Calcutta, renamed Royal College in 1881, enabled the students to sit for London University external degrees. It was during this time that several colleges established by the religious missionaries, Christian as well as Buddhist provided the opportunity to go for higher education. Their devoted attention leading to excellence in studies elevated the colleges to prestigious position. The secondary schools thus emerged were producing students who had to be provided with higher education, culminated in the demand for University education. At the same time a new era was going to be witnessed.
The Legislative Council as far back as 1870 which truly opposed the earlier mentioned affiliation preferred the British Universities to Indian ones. As it was discontinued, the rich and the affluent just a handful, were happy to educate their children in the United Kingdom. Education then was in the English medium confined to the rich. Fees were charged and University education was beyond the reach of the average. Yet the general opinion of the wealthy was that a local seat of higher learning was a dire necessity. The executive council having discussed the matter, adopted a resolution for the establishment of a University College, so that those who are anxious, could do a degree without proceeding to UK. The outcome was a University College affiliated to the University of London, which was of a no value to the professional elite who were clamouring for an academic model that would make a meaningful contribution to the forward march of the country. It was against this backdrop that there emerged a legendary University of Ceylon. Thus began the great edifice that has spread to many parts of the island as a network continuing to this day.
The University of Ceylon was set up in Colombo, under the British in 1942 until the premises were prepared at Peradeniya. At this juncture, Dr. C. W. W. Kannangara, respected as the father of free education, during his tenure as the Minister of Education in the State Council (1931 to 1947) brought about a drastic change in the sphere of education. Along with his greatest contribution – the Free Education scheme, the establishment of the Peradeniya University, the concept of the Central Schools opened the doors of higher education to the poor and the talented.
Thanks to the sincere efforts of the doyen of education, the way was thus paved for the clever, rural intelligentsia to reap the benefits of university education. Now on the completion of the first phase of the University at Peradeniya in 1952, after ten years' stay in Colombo, the first residential university commenced with the arrival of 820 students of the Arts and Oriental faculties. I do still remember how the most esteemed journal widely read, even at that time, the Daily News carried the photograph of their departure to Peradeniya by train. It was a happy occasion for the then Entrance students to watch the scene. They arrived at the “haven on earth”, the newly constructed majestic university of regal splendor, in a picturesque, scenic location with greenery all round, founded by the intellectual genius – Sir Ivor Jennings. Whatever this may mean, it cannot be denied that this magnificent seat of learning owes its origin to the colonial masters and its legacy lives on.
True Wonder
When it was first inaugurated it was a true wonder and it was the best ever, in this part of the globe. Beautiful memories must be still alive in their hearts and minds. It was set up on the British University model (Oxford, Cambridge) described as the best in the British Empire, following a steady upward journey towards academic excellence. The Tudor style halls of residence were still another example. My memories flash back to our first day in the campus. My friends to this day – Padmini, Winnie, Shiva Beatrice and Chandra when going for a walk in the cool breezy evening, I vividly remember how we met late Dr. Horace Perera, the father figure in History, during our student days. The first question he put to us was “Do you feel yourself important? Of course that was a wonderful question that enhanced our first impression.
Having served the Motherland in numerous ways, living in retirement, in Switzerland, in his mid 90s he has passed away. May his soul rest in peace. One time glory of the University, still linger in our hearts. It proved its value as the highest academic institution. Study programmes and curriculum then, was the most advanced on par with modern trends and methods, in addition to the excellent facilities provided. There was the strong tradition of quality in every aspect. In short, the University of Ceylon offered the best for everyone.
Transition Post – Independence Era
The decade beginning with 1960 marked the new era. Wealthy and the privileged that dominated the University scene, after independence gradually decreased. It came to be centred on truly bright and intelligent. The introduction of Free education system led to the admission of Swabasha medium students who had to exist with the English speaking elite for sometime.
Competition to seek admission became a feature as the State University could accommodate only a limited number, the concept of external students too had to be considered. On the whole, the role of the University too had to be changed taking many progressive steps to suit the emerging needs in the post independence era. This led to the expansion, extending a historic service, laying the foundation for a network to serve the country. Mahapola Scholarship scheme, the brainchild of Honourable Minister, Lalith Athulathmudali, which opened the doors to the intelligent but economically backward students for university education at this juncture should also be mentioned here. The colourful history of the University of Ceylon does not end here. It has touched the hearts and minds of thousands uncountable, with a deep sense of affection, which is evident from the writer herself.
