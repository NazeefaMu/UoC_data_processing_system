Tisara Engineering joins RCGC to sponsor August Monthly Medal

Recognized for delivering turn-key, economical engineering solutions to some of Sri Lanka’s most prestigious brands for over two decades, Tisara Engineering teed off in a new direction this month by stepping forward to be the main sponsor of the recent Royal Colombo Golf Club - August Monthly Medal. This monthly golf tournament is a highly anticipated event in the Sri Lankan golf calendar and attracts over 150 golfers from different parts of Sri Lanka every month.
In addition to an admirable display of golfing prowess and sportsmanship that yielded 17 winners from four divisions, the August Tournament also set the stage for the presenting of the Golf Club’s first ever “Best Caddie” Award. The tournament additionally featured an exciting ‘business card raffle draw’ which gave club members a chance to win 2 return air tickets to Malaysia courtesy of Tisara Engineering.
Tisara Engineering is a subsidiary of the Tisara Group, an established engineering solutions provider that represents some of the world’s best brands in industrial and portable air compressors, aerial work platforms, lift equipment, packing & seals and mobile crushing plants.
