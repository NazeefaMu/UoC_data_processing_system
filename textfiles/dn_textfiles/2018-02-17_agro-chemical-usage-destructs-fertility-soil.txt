'Agro chemical usage destructs fertility of soil'

The fertility of the soil in the Hambantota District has been destroyed with agro chemical usage, former Agriculture Assistant Director Hemantha Amarasinha said.
He was addressing the District Agriculture Committee meeting held at the administration complex.
He said that excessive usage of agro chemicals had destructed the fertility of soil and samples of soil tested for the carbonic value of soil has shown a four percent decrease.
Setting fire to straw also worsened the situation and the soil of the entire district are tested at the moment, he said.
He cautioned the farmers to use carbonic fertiliser to prevent the destruction.
