Jayathma: Second UN Envoy on Youth from July 17

Jayathma Wickramanayake will officially become the second United Nations Envoy on Youth on July 17, UN Country Representative for Sri Lanka Una McCauley yesterday said at a press conference at the UN office.
Secretary-General of the UN Antonio Guterres appointed her, and she will replace current envoy Ahmed Alhendawi.
Wickramanayake has worked with the UN for years, having represented Sri Lankan youth as a UN youth delegate and as a member of the Youth Parliament. She was a youth negotiator in the process that led to the adoption of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. In Sri Lanka, she worked on the post-conflict reconciliation process.
Though she has lived in Sri Lanka her whole life, Wickramanayake said she was very excited to move to New York to better the plight of the world’s youth. “Youth development is one key element to sustain and develop our world, not just in Sri Lanka but everywhere. This is an opportunity to work with a lot more people worldwide,” she said. She said the she hopes to boost investment in youth development programmes, including youth councils and youth events. She also hopes to work with young women and refugees.
“This is a great opportunity for stakeholders, whether they are youth organisations, members of the private sector, or universities, to work closely together to create a visionary agenda for young people that promotes youth participation.
Wickramanayake thanked the Sri Lankan taxpayers for funding her schooling and helping her get to where she is today. “My story is a testament to what Asian young women can achieve if they’re empowered,” she said.
