A group of nearly 50 persons from Colombo, Negombo, Wennappuwa, Marawila and Thoduwawa were present at the Marawila Police station when he surrendered.
Shehan Curera, a resident of Negombo alleged that this suspect had defrauded him and his relatives by obtaining nearly Rs.500 million from them.

The suspect confessed that he could not give a time frame to return the money to his debtors, but intended to pay back his clients after selling a house owned by him and receives nearly Rs.100 million from the proceeds.Marawila Police are conducting investigations.
