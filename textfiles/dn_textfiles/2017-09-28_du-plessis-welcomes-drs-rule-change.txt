Du Plessis welcomes  DRS rule change

Potchefstroom: South African captain Faf du Plessis on Wednesday welcomed a change to the decision review system that will come into effect for the first time in the first Test against Bangladesh starting at Senwes Park on Thursday.
The change in the DRS system is one of several changes to playing regulations made by the International Cricket Council, including a restriction on bat sizes and a provision for players to be sent off the field for serious misconduct.
Teams will no longer lose a review for a leg before wicket decision if television replays show “umpire’s call” – a provision for umpires to have discretion on close decisions. Previously an unsuccessful review meant losing one of two opportunities for challenges in Test matches.
“The umpire’s call is a very good change,” said Du Plessis. “The system is there to back up the umpire but if you ask for a review and have made the right call (on whether the ball is shown to be hitting or missing part of the stumps) at least you get it back.”
Another change to the regulations is that reviews will not be re-set after 80 overs as in the past. AFP
