Child bone marrow transplants successful

About 30 successful bone marrow transplant surgeries have been performed on children so far <U+200B>in Sri Lanka, Health Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne said.
Addressing the gathering after laying the foundation stone to launch the development projects at the Aluthgama Provincial Hospital, he said 13 hospitals will be developed with Chinese aid. The total cost of all development projects will be US $ 85 million.
According to Minister Senaratne, in addition to developing hospitals, medical equipment will also be provided. All state hospitals in the Kalutara district are to be developed. A total of Rs. 450 million will be spent on developing provincial hospitals. A 22-storeyed building will be constructed for the Out Patients' Department (OPD) of the Colombo National Hospital.
The Ragama Teaching Hospital and Colombo National Hospital had performed 35 successful liver transplant surgeries. One leg had also been transplanted. The patient is doing well. However, four patients who underwent leg transplant surgeries in other countries had died, the minister said.
During the past regime, a large sum was spent on publicity. But now, no publicity was given to the work carried out by the government. Media gives negative publicity for weeks and not for positive things such as reducing the prices of drugs etc. The law is implemented for all, including the sons of ministers. Journalists have the freedom to criticize anyone, the minister added.
