CEB employees to receive bonus

The Ministry of Power and Renewable Energy has decided to provide the Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) with their bonuses for this year. The Secretary to the Ministry of Power and Renewable Energy was expected to receive approval for the bonuses through a special paper submitted to the CEB Director Board yesterday.
Joint Trade Union Alliance Convener, Ranjan Jayalal speaking to Daily News said, “The Engineers who took the bribe of Rs 225,000 in 2014 have requested the Ministry not to provide our bonuses. We would launch a continuous strike if the bonuses are not given to us. A total of 23,000 workers will join us in Colombo for the strike”. President of the Engineer’s Union of the CEB, Saumya Kumarawadu in the meantime, explained that, “In 2014 a salary scale was introduced for the technical staff by the government at the time and that it was through this that they had received their salary increments. Usually we get our increments every three years and the approvals which were taken in the year 2015 were for our increments for the year 2014”.
“The ‘Viduli Sevaka Sangamaya’ of the Ceylon Electricity Board has filed a case in the Court of Appeal and the Accounts Division of the Ceylon Electricity Board has filed three cases in the Supreme Court, in which one of the cases was found to have no grounds to proceed further. So if we had taken any illegal money or bribe, the Courts would decide accordingly,” he added.
