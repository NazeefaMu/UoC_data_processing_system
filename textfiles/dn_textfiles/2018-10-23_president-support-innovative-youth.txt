President support innovative youth

A miniature rocket developed by student Gihan Hettiarachchi of Gampaha Bandaranaike Vidyalaya captured the attention of President Maithripala Sirisena when he attended the school’s Centenary celebrations as the Chief Guest and opened the X-Ban Exhibition held to showcase student talents on October 13. The President yesterday presented a financial grant of Rs.1 million to the student to further develop his innovation and also directed technical officers of the Sri Lanka Air Force to help Hettiarachchi launch the rocket.
