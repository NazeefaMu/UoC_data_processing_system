A ‘reel’ treat!

China and Sri Lanka have celebrated 60 years of diplomatic relations. It would be accurate to say that relations between China and Sri Lanka are the stuff of legend. In fact legend is the correct word because our relations date back over hundreds of years.
Both countries have become popular destinations for tourists. Fa-Hien the celebrated Chinese Buddhist pilgrim traveled to Sri Lanka, visiting Anuradhapura in 413 A.D. Chinese General Cheng-Ho who visited Sri Lanka left a record in a tri-lingual stone inscription before he left. In this slab the three faiths –Buddhism, Hindu and Islam are revered in a single inscription.
Since then the relationships between both countries have come a long way, with the Chinese media streaming into the island. One needs to only frequent Colombo to see China’s hand in our industry. Daily News attended the opening ceremony of the second Chinese Film Festival which was graced by the presence of Minister of Parliamentary Reforms and Mass Media Gayantha Karunathilaka. The film festival began on February 16 and will end on the 21st. It will feature eight movies ranging from youth to romance to action. It is free of charge for the public.

“Last year the Chinese Film Festival attracted a monumental audience. This will be the second Chinese Film Festival in Sri Lanka. It is one of the major events held to celebrate the Chinese New Year. The Chinese New Year is also called the ‘Spring Festival’ in China. All these festivals in China date back 4000 years. It is important for the Chinese people, because Spring festival means family reunions and gatherings in China. The Chinese New Year celebrations will bring joy and harmony to the Sri Lankan people,” said the Political Counselor at the Embassy of China in Sri Lanka, Pang Chunxue. Chunxue also commented that the Spring Festival is one of the major programs to celebrate the 60th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations between China and Sri Lanka. “It is also the 65th anniversary of the signing of our rubber and the rice pact between China and Sri Lanka. China and Sri Lanka are close neighbors enjoying centuries of friendship. 60 years ago we established diplomatic relations and because of the concerted effort of both sides, the bilateral relationships have always been based on sound understanding despite the internal conflict of both nations.
We are very proud of the tremendous achievements achieved through the bilateral relations during these six decades,” explained Chunxue. Chunxue stressed that there is a certain confidence about the future of our bilateral relations.
“This will be even better in the years to come. China is ready to work with Sri Lanka for the well- being of our two peoples and for the lasting friendship between our two nations. Last and not least, I would like to use this opportunity to extend my gratitude to the National Film Corporation of Sri Lanka and the public performance board for the great support for this festival. I wish all a happy and prosperous Chinese New year,” summed up Chunxue Minister of Parliamentary Reforms and Mass Media Gayantha Karunathilaka did not conceal his heartfelt pleasure at attending the opening ceremony. His speech was filled with warmth and passion.
Strengthening relations
“As you are all aware China and Sri Lanka relations date back many centuries. Throughout the years our relations were strengthened with ever more warmth and friendship. And it will continue to be so for centuries to come. If you look at our history, centuries back, the monk Fa-Hien and admiral Cheng Ho gives us evidence of strong and bonded ties that we enjoy.
Pang Chunxue
This year marks the 60 anniversary of diplomatic relations between our two nations. If you examine history, I am honored and humbled to say that Sri Lanka has recognized the formation of Peoples Republic of China, by being one of the very first nations to do so in 1948 by our first Prime Minister D.S. Senanayake who was also the founding leader of the United National Party which I represent as a member of Parliament and Cabinet Minister today,” said Karunathilaka. Karunathilaka also pointed out that it is worth mentioning that the historical rubber-rice pact which was signed in 1952, was again under the leadership of the United National Party government which brought immense benefit to Sri Lanka.
Official ties
“Therefore I would be proud to say that even before we established official diplomatic ties in 1957, the Sri Lanka government had official ties with Peoples Republic of China since its formation in 1948,” pointed out Karunathilaka This is the second time we are having a Chinese Film Festival during their new year season. “When we Sri Lankans celebrate new year in April according to the Solar Calendar, Chinese Celebrate their new year according to the lunar calendar. Last month, January 28, Chinese people around the world welcomed the year of the Rooster according to the Chinese tradition.
Therefore my new year wish to your excellency, the Ambassador, is that during the year of the Rooster may we be able to organize a Sri Lankan Film Festival in China. As Sri Lankans we love eating Chinese foods. Or watching Chinese martial arts movies.
I believe that although we have strong political, economic and foreign relations with China, we bond with China through social and cultural ties at a personal level even more strongly,” elucidated Karunathilaka Karunathilaka expressed his views that if you want to understand a country’s culture and social life you need to see their art, music, drama, food, fashion and history. “But if you look at a film from that country you will see all of this entwined nicely. Therefore I appreciate the effort of the Chinese Embassy and the Chinese Cultural Center in Colombo and the National Film Corporation for organizing this film festival. I wish this film festival be a success and gift to the Chinese New Year,” summed up Karunathilaka. Pictures by Sarath Peiris
