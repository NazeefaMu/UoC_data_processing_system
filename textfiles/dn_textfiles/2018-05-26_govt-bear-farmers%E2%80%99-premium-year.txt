Govt to bear farmers’ premium this year

The Agriculture Ministry will provide paddy farmers with the agriculture insurance premium free for the first time this year.
The government had allocated Rs.5228 million for the agriculture insurance this year.
Farmers who cultivate paddy, chilli, maize, potatoes and onions will also be eligible for the insurance.
The initiative for this programme was proposed by Agriculture minister Mahinda Amaraweera.
Paddy farmers had to spend Rs.1375 as the annual membership fee for the insurance programme. However, the government had decided to bear the fee on behalf of the farmers this year.
The ceremony to present the insurance cover before the ‘yala season’ will be held on Monday at the Nonagama cultural centre in Hambantota with the participation of Agriculture Minister Mahinda Amaraweera and State Minister Wasantha Aluwihare.
