This summer’s blockbuster movie ‘Skyscraper’ centres around a fictional megatall tower that is intended to be as realistic as possible, according to architect Adrian Smith, who was consulted during its development.
Drama in the action-adventure film revolves around an imaginary 240-storey skyscraper in Hong Kong, called The Pearl, which catches on fire.
The movie’s director Rawson Marshall Thurber wanted to make the building believable, so enlisted Chicago-based Smith – whose firm Adrian Smith + Gordon Gill Architecture is behind some of the world’s tallest structures – to advise on the project during the writing process.
“Fictional skyscrapers in theory have no limits and can be designed using systems and materials that do not currently exist,” Smith told Dezeen. “This was not the case with the skyscraper in the movie since the producer wanted this to be a tower based on real possibilities.”
Smith’s portfolio of skyscrapers includes the 828-metre-tall Burj Khalifa in Dubai, which currently holds the title of world’s tallest tower. This is set to be surpassed by his firm’s Jeddah Tower in Saudi Arabia, which is under construction and set to rise over 1,000 metres once complete.
To help Skyscraper’s director and writers, Smith provided information about these projects and others for them to reference when creating the story around The Pearl.
