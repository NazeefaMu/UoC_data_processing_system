SWAROVSKI PRESENTS GEM VISIONS 2018

For its 2018 edition, Gem Visions, the industry-leading trend and design service from the Swarovski Gemstone Business, is prepared to fling open its doors on a Wunderkammer packed with ideas, inspiration and pure creative energy. Gem Vision 2018 Preview Presentation was organized by Swarovski Gemstones and presented by Kurt Zbinden, Vice President Operations Asia Pacific and Roza Topolnicka, Head of Creative and Retail Marketing. The launch was held in Sri Lanka on February 24, 2017 at the Kingsbury hotel with a large participation from leading jewelers and jewellery designers.
Re-imaging the concept of a Renaissance cabinet of curiosities for the modern era has offered Swarovski a magical showcase in which to display its remarkable array of genuine gemstones and created stones.
This is done in direct relationship to the cultural megatrends that are actively shaping the design directions for the worldwide jewelry industry. Gem Visions’ world-class team of in-house creative, gem-hunters, and technical gurus has worked tirelessly alongside consultant jewelry experts, trend forecasters and futurologists to identify and evaluate the evolution of these trends. These experts have identified three major design directions, Naturalia, Mirabilia and Artificialia that are pervading the cultural consciousness. Each incorporates two key trends, and together they make up Gem Visions’ Wunderkammer of delights, a heady concoction designed to intrigue, provoke and inspire.
