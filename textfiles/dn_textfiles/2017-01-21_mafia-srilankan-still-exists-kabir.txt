Mafia at SriLankan still exists: Kabir

Public Enterprise Development Minister Kabir Hashim yesterday expressed disappointment over not being able to clean up SriLankan Airlines and bring the offenders to book.
“There is a mafia within SriLankan Airlines and they still exist. It is not only SriLankan but even other government institutions have this. The Weliamuna report was released during the first 100 days but no action has been taken,” the minister told a media briefing at the ministry.
The Weliamuna report accused several top officials including its former Chairman Nishantha Wickremesinghe of financial misappropriation.
“Certain people have to go to clean up SriLankan and I am determined to clean it up. We are going ahead with the systematic changes that need to be made. I don’t want it to be seen as political revenge,” he said.
Meanwhile, SriLankan Airlines Chairman Ajith Dias dismissed the Weliamuna report and said there was no problem with the airline.
The Minister responding to it said: “Everybody has a right to an opinion but I believe that the Weliamuna report is valid and that it has to be implemented”. In response to why he did not take appropriate action, Hashim said he was restricted when it came to implementing certain things.
“The Finance Ministry has a golden share of these institutions and thus they too have the authority to appoint people. My powers are limited but I am trying to work around that,” he said.
