Youngest player to top ICC player rankings

India, Sri Lanka and Pakistan have always produced the best spinners in world cricket throughout the years but the three nations now have stiff competition from Afghanistan.
Less than one-year-old as a full member nation, the Afghanistan national cricket team’s rise has been phenomenal to say the least.
Cricket has been played in Afghanistan since the mid-19th century, but it is only in recent years that the world has taken notice of the national team after it was granted a full ICC membership along with Ireland.
Afghanistan recently hammered Zimbabwe in the United Arab Emirates and won the 5-match ODI series 4-1 with two spin bowlers playing the starring roles.
Leg-spinner Rashid Khan and off-break bowler Mujeeb Zadran are making waves in world cricket and were the chief architects in their team’s triumph in the UAE.
Rashid ended up as the highest wicket-taker in the series with 16 wickets in 5 ODIs at an average of 7.93 with best bowling figures of 5 for 24.
Rashid joined India pacer Jasprit Bumrah at the top of the ICC ODI rankings for bowlers to become the youngest to attain top ranking.
His 51 runs in two innings in the Zimbabwe series, including a brisk 43 in the final match in Sharjah last Monday, also helped him break into the top-five in the list of all-rounders while he has also moved up 11 slots to take 114th place among batsmen.
Overall he has 86 wickets in 37 ODIs which makes him the most successful bowler in the 50-over format after 37 games ahead of some great names like Saqlain Mushtaq (73), Mitchell Starc (73), Ajantha Mendis (72) and Shane Bond (71).
Sixteen-year-old Mujeeb came in a close second with 12 wickets at 17.58 with best figures of 5 for 50 in the 4th ODI which made him the youngest bowler to take a five-wicket haul in one-day internationals The teenage spin twins had also picked up 7 wickets each in the three-match ODI series against Ireland last month.
Nineteen-year-old Rashid has already become a household name in India and Australia after finishing as the second highest wicket-taker (11 wickets in 7 matches at an average of 16.63) in the World Twenty20 in 2016. He then made a huge impact in his debut seasons in the Indian Premier League last year and the Big Bash League this year. 2016 IPL champions Sunrisers Hyderabad had seen Rashid’s potential and skill which is why they paid a whopping Rs 4 crore for his services last year.
The Nangarhar-born cricketer repaid the faith shown in him by the team management with 17 wickets in just 14 matches in his debut season at an average of 21.05.
He was the second highest wicket-taker for SRH behind purple cap holder and teammate Bhuvneshwar Kumar (26 wickets in 14 matches) and the sixth-highest overall last season.
That is why SRH retained Rashid using the Right to Match card for a mind-boggling Rs 9 crore at the auction last month making him the joint-seventh costliest player along with Australia’s Glenn Maxwell.
He was costlier than even India’s first choice spinners - Yuzvendra Chahal (RTM by RCB for Rs 6 crore) and Kuldeep Yadav (RTM by KKR for Rs 5.80 crore).
He was even better in the BBL this season finishing as the joint-highest wicket-taker, along with Dwayne Bravo, with 18 scalps in 11 matches at 13.83.
Then comes Mujeeb, who burst onto the international scene in December last year against Ireland, which made him the first cricketer born in the 21st century to make his international debut.
Mujeeb picked up 4 wickets for 24 runs in 10 overs as Afghanistan defeated Ireland by 138 runs in the 1st ODI of the three-match series. He now holds the joint-best figures for an Afghan bowler on ODI debut with Shapoor Zadran.
The Khost-born spinner also went for a staggering price in the IPL auction last month, being sold for Rs 4 crore to Kings XI Punjab despite not having played in the tournament yet.
Mujeeb will now be aiming to make an impact as big as Rashid did in his maiden season in the IPL and make his country proud just like his national teammate.
