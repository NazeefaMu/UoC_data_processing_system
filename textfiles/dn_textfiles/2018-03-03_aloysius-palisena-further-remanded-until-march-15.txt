Aloysius, Palisena further remanded until March 15

Perpetual Treasuries Limited (PTL) beneficiary owner Arjun Aloysius and its Chief Executive Officer Kasun Palisena, arrested in connection with the controversial Central Bank Bond issue, were yesterday ordered to be further remanded until March 15 by the Colombo Fort Magistrate’s Court.
The court was informed through Deputy Solicitor General Haripriya Jayasundara that notices issued on a previous occasion directing Arjun Aloysius to be present before the CID had not been served.
The Magistrate had issued an order directing former Central Bank Governor Arjuna Mahendran to appear before the CID to make a statement, before March 8. The notices in this regard were sent through DHL Courier Service.
“A representative of DHL Courier Service in Singapore had reported that the recipient has moved out after it visited Arjuna Mahendran’s residence in Singapore.
The CID director had also sent an email asking him to appear before the CID on March 8,” DSG Jayasundara added.
On February 16, Magistrate Lanka Jayaratne refused to release the two suspects on bail citing that reasons given by the defence are not sufficient enough to consider releasing the suspects on bail under exceptional circumstances.
The suspects have been charged under the Public Property Act, Penal Code, Registered Stocks and Securities Ordinance and Code of Conduct for Primary Dealers for illegal insider trading.
The Magistrate observed that the concerned Treasury Bonds can be considered as property described under Section 388 of the Penal Code.
Meanwhile, the Magistrate granted permission to the CID to record statements from Aloysius and Palisena at the Colombo remand prison between March 5 and March 15.
The Magistrate further issued an order directing the Prison Superintendent to take necessary steps regarding the defence complaint that Arjun Aloysius was suffering from a skin disease with ulcer urinary symptoms.
Filing a B report before the Colombo Fort Magistrate’s Court regarding the Central Bank Bond issuance on February 27, 2015, the CID had named former Central Bank Governor Arjuna Mahendran, Perpetual Treasuries Limited (PTL) beneficiary owner Arjun Aloysius, its Chief Executive Officer Kasun Palisena and the PTL as suspects in the case.
The prosecution maintained that there had been a direct loss to the government following the issuance of bonds on February 27, 2015.
The prosecution said that Arjuna Mahendran can be charged with the criminal breach of trust, misappropriation of public funds and two others for aiding and abetting to commit this offence.
Deputy Solicitor General Haripriya Jayasundara with Senior State Counsel Lakmini Girihagama appeared for the CID.
Defence Counsel Kalinga Indatissa PC with Counsel Jeewantha Jayatilleke appeared for the suspects.
