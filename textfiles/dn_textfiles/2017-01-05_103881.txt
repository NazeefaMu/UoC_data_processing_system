District Judge orders Army to submit LTTE surrendees’ list

Mullaitivu District Judge M.S.M.Samsudeen who inquired into several Habeas Corpus applications filed in Court on January 3, ordered the Sri Lanka Army to submit a list of names of LTTE members who surrendered to the Army on the final day of the war in the North, on the next day of hearing on January 30.
Relatives of several former LTTE members have filed 14 Habeas Corpus applications in the Mullaitivu District Court alleging that nearly 400 LTTE members who surrendered to the Army had gone missing. They also said that two Catholic Priests had signed as witnesses when these LTTE members surrendered to the Army and the surrendees were taken away by the Army in buses along with the two priests.
