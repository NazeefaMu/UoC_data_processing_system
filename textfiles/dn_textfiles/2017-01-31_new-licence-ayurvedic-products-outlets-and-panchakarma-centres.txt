New licence for Ayurvedic products outlets and Panchakarma Centres

Health Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne has decided to issue a new licence for all Ayurvedic products outlets and Panchakarma Centres in 2017 cancelling the current licence to make the licence issuing system accurate and methodical, a Health Ministry spokesman said.
The spokesman said Dr. Senaratne had taken this decision after considering the large number of complaints received from the public and the police in connection with those institutions.
Another reason that led Minister Senaratne to make this decision was the information he received from Central Province Health Minister Bandula Yalegama in connection with Babul being sold among schoolchildren by registered and unregistered persons, the spokesman said.
Ayurveda Commissioner A. H. Thilakaratne informed Dr. Senaratne that houses of ill fame operate countrywide on the pretext of massage parlours. He also said most operate with fake licences of Ayurveda issued to run Panchakarma Centres.
