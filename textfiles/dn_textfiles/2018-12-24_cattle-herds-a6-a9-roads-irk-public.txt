Cattle herds on A6, A9 roads irk public

Herds of cattle wandering on A6 and A9 roads cause traffic jams and inconvenience the public very much. Many road accidents occur due to this situation, residents of the area complain.
Provincial authorities have not taken any steps to prevent cattle from scattering on the roads so far. The herds of cattle eat vegetables and other eatables from cafes at either side of the roads and cause immense losses to the businessperson as well.
They urge authorities to resolve the issue fast.
