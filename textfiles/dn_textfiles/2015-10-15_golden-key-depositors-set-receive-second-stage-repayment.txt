Golden Key depositors set to receive second stage repayment

The Cabinet of Ministers approved the release an advance of Rs. 3,945.6 million from the General Treasury to the Central Bank (CBSL) for the second stage repayment to Golden Key depositors, said Health, Nutrition and Indigenous Medicine Minister and Cabinet Spokesman Dr. Rajith Senaratne.
Minister Senaratne stated that this amount of money is approved to repay the deposit holders of the Golden Key Credit Card Company Limited (GKCCCL) holding deposits from Rs. 2 million to Rs. 10 million and to reimburse the said amount to the General Treasury by liquidation of assets of the GKCCCL.
The Minister made these observation at yesterday's Cabinet briefing held at the Information Department auditorium.
The minister stated that the repayment schedule was prepared by the Central Bank of Sri Lanka (CBSL) for resolving the difficulties confronted by the deposit holders of the GKCCCL. He added that as its first step the General Treasury had granted an advance of Rs. 544.3 million for the repayment to deposit holders who have deposits worth less than Rs. 2 million.
The proposal to the Cabinet was made by Finance Minister Ravi Karunanyake.
