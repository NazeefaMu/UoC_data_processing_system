Daredevil season 3: Kingpin's return confirmed as showrunner announced

 
Marvel’s Netflix series have been diminishing in quality recently, Iron Fist and The Defenders having been somewhat substandard compared to Jessica Jones and Luke Cage.
Daredevil has remained somewhat sturdy throughout: an excellent first season followed by a second season that started out tremendously before losing pace.
With The Hand having been vanquished, the upcoming third season will feature an old favourite as the primary antagonist. 
According to Deadline, Vincent D’Onofrio will return as Wilson Fisk, the Kingpin crime lord who was present throughout season one, making a fleeting appearance in season two. 
There will also be a new showrunner taking over proceedings, Erik Oleson — best known for writing episodes of Arrow and The Man in the High Castle — handling proceedings. 
“Vincent is an exceptional actor who returns with the incredible gravitas he brings to Fisk,” Marvel TV chief Jeph Loeb said of the announcement. 
“We’re very excited how Marvel’s Daredevil develops through the creative lens and guidance of our new showrunner, Erik Oleson.”
Oleson takes over from second season showrunners Doug Petrie and Marco Ramirez, both of whom originally helmed The Defenders although Petire left early on.
Season three does not have a release date yet, neither have the second seasons of Jessica Jones and Luke Cage. The Punisherreaches Netflix 17 November.
