‘Increasing savings AND investment essential’

The rate of investment and domestic savings supplemented with foreign direct investment will be the most pertinent determinants to achieve desired 6 % economic growth in Sri Lanka, said Dr. P. Nandalal Weerasinghe, Senior Deputy Governor, Central Bank of Sri Lanka.
Emphasising that savings and investment gap to be financed through portfolio investment, increased foreign direct investment and loan and grant inflows to the government, Dr. Nandalal said that in Sri Lanka, investment as a percentage of GDP is hovering around 32%-35% while domestic savings has tendered to hover around 25-28%.
He made these remarks speaking at EU- Sri Lanka Trade related assistance workshop on Investment Negotiations.
“So, it is essential to increase domestic savings and attract higher amounts of foreign investment to achieve the desired growth rate.”
Underscoring the importance of adopting a rule based transparent system to attract FDI into Sri Lanka, Dr. Nandalal said, “there is a gap between what is available in domestic savings and what is required to attract investment into the country .This where foreign investments come into play.” The deputy governor also stressed that those who bring in money to Sri Lanka should be encouraged and given concessions.
Quoting Global Investment Report 2018, Sonali Wijeratne, Director General of Commerce, Department of Commerce speaking at the event said global flows of foreign direct investment fell by 23 per cent in 2017. Cross-border investment in developed and transition economies dropped sharply, while growth was near zero in developing economies.
With only a very modest recovery predicted for 2018, this negative trend is a long-term concern for policymakers worldwide, especially for developing countries, where international investment is indispensable for sustainable industrial development.
“Structural impacts of the digital economy on foreign direct investment are posing formidable challenges for developing and least developing countries. Developing countries also need to contain rising challenges such as negative trends in global investment scenario.” Developing countries are beset by structural constraints and lack of adequate infrastructure, scarce facilities to finance, strategic issues and domestic labor shortages, she noted. Wijeratne also underscored the need to create a conducive investment environment in the face of troubling global picture characterized by open, transparent and non-discriminatory investment policies.
Dayaratna Silva, National Project Coordinator-EU-Sri Lanka Trade Related Assistance program speaking at the workshop noted that free trade negotiations are key components of the government’s policy agenda and modern free trade agreements are going beyond trade and goods encompassing a wide range of trade policy issues such as investments.
I believe sound investment policies, aimed at attracting FDI is an important component of the development strategy and Sri Lanka’s investment policies too should fall in line with industrial policies.
“Industrial policy shouldn’t be a taboo world. In certain circles, it is a taboo world.”
According to the World Investment Report 2018, 101 countries have adopted industrial development strategies during the last decade.
The report also shows that new types of industrial policies have emerged, responding to the opportunities and challenges associated with a new industrial revolution.
