Trinity-Kingswood rugby clash should be close

The eagerly awaited confrontation between the first two schools who played an inter-school rugby match in 1906, Kingswood College and Trinity will be a close tussle when they meet in a schools rugby match at Nittawela today at 4.30 pm.
It will be interesting to see how both teams who are good at rugby dish out today. Kingwoodians lost their opening game to Royal College and in the second game beat S. Thomas’. Trinity who beat St. Anthony’s College in the first game went down in the second game to St. Joseph’s College in their own den, due to poor rugby.
Kingswoodians is led by Tharindu Waligampala and Trinity by Avishka Shiek.
