Gammanpila allowed to travel to Laos

The Colombo High Court yesterday permitted Pivithuru Hela Urumaya (PHU) leader MP Udaya Gammanpila to travel to Laos from June 12 to 15.
MP Gammanpila whose passport was impounded by Court for allegedly cheating Rs.20 million and misappropriation of another Rs.21 million following his alleged fraudulent share transaction, had sought the Colombo High Court’s permission to temporary lift his travel ban. Accordingly, his passport was ordered to be released on a personal bond of Rs.500,000 by High Court Judge R.Gurusinghe.
Defence Counsel Thushara Dissanayake appearing for MP Gammanpila moved the High Court that his client be allowed to travel to Laos from June 12 and June 15 to participate in an official tour for Parliamentarians. Deputy Solicitor General Dilan Ratnayake appearing on behalf of the Attorney General informed Court that the prosecution would not raise objections for the request.
Minister Athukorale was examining the relief camps set up for the victims of the Thoranakada, Arabbakanda landslide.
