Wheels move on Horana tyre factory: Navin

The process of setting up of the tyre plant in Horana has not been suspended, Plantation Industries Minister Navin Dissanayake said yesterday.
The minister said there was no truth in the rumour that Sri Lanka's largest fully integrated tyre manufacturing plant of which the foundation stone was laid by Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe recently, had been suspended by the President. He made these observations at a press conference at the Plantation Industries Ministry auditorium.
He said work on the factory was in progress.
Dissanayake said the setting up of the factory would benefit the country's rubber cultivation and in turn the country's economy.
"I don't mind as to where the money is from and who owns the money as far as the money is invested in the country," the minister said.
"The banks take the responsibility of the money. They would not accept black money."
