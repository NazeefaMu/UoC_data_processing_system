Radiologist arrested

A radiologist attached to a private hospital in Kandy who had allegedly taken nude pictures of a woman kidney patient admitted to the scanning room for a MRI scan  on his mobile phone after blindfolding her was arrested by the Kandy Police Children and Women’s Bureau officials on March 29.
The woman who realised this on suspicion after removing her blindfold had followed the radiologist who left the room and snatched the phone after grappling with him.
She had later lodged a complaint with the Police after submitting the phone as proof. Police who checked the photo clips in the phone had established that the man had taken the photographs. The suspect was produced before Kandy Chief Magistrate Gihan Indika Attanayake and remanded till April 6. Investigations are continuing.
