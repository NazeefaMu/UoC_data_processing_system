Welikada prisoners call off hunger strike

The hunger strike launched by the prisoners who were sentenced to death and life imprisonment in the Welikda Prison yesterday called off, Commissioner of Prisons T.N. Upuldeniya said.
Speaking to the Daily News, Upuldeniya said the prisoners took yesterday afternoon meal as a token of calling off their strike.
Over 150 prisoners who were sentenced to death and serving life imprisonment in the Welikada Prison launched a hunger strike last Friday (15). They demanded to be paroled via a common pardon.
According to Upuldeniya, the inmates who were on hunger strike were unaware of the committee appointed by the Justice Ministry which gives recommendations to the President on the fate of prisoners.
After they were made aware of the committee, they called off the hunger strike, Upuldeniya said.
The 50 inmates in the Bogambara Prison who were in a hunger strike from last Thursday (14), are still refusing food, Commissioner Upuldeniya said.
“We are taking steps to make them aware of the committee appointed by the Ministry. We are positive that they will call off the strike,” Upuldeniya said.
