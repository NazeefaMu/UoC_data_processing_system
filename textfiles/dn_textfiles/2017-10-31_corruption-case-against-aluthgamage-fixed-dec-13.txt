Corruption case against Aluthgamage fixed for Dec. 13

A corruption case filed against former Sports Minister Mahindananda Aluthgamage and another Sports Ministry official for allegedly committing a Rs. 53.1 million fraud while importing sports equipment during the last Presidential Election, was yesterday fixed for December 13 by the Colombo Chief Magistrate.
When the case came up before Chief Magistrate Lal Ranasinghe Bandara, the former Minister was not present in Court. The Court was informed through the defence counsel that the accused was attending Parliamentary sessions.
Meanwhile, the Chief Magistrate issued an order directing the former Minister for his passport to be handed over to the Court. The Commission to Investigate Allegations of Bribery and Corruption had filed a corruption case in the Colombo Chief Magistrate's Court against former Sports Minister, Joint Opposition MP Mahindananda Aluthgamage, and another official at the Sports Ministry, over a Rs. 53.1 million fraud said to have taken place when importing sports equipment.
