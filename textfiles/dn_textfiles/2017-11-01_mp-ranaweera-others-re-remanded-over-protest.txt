MP Ranaweera, others re-remanded over protest

MP Prasanna Ranaweera, Provincial Councillors Upali Kodikara, Ajith Prasanna and 31 others were further remanded until November 13 by Hambantota Magistrate Manjula Karunaratne yesterday, over their involvement in the protest outside the Indian Consulate in Hambantota.
Out of the 32 arrested by Police, one person was released having posted two personal bails of Rs. 500,000 each on the ground of having to pursue his higher education.
MP Namal Rajapaksa, MP D.V.Chanaka and Provincial Councillor Sampath Athukorala who were arrested and currently out on bail, arrived at court yesterday for the hearing.
The Police also informed Courts that they had to arrest five others including a monk with regard to the case and asked that the suspects be remanded until they can file charges against the five on the advice of the Attorney General’s Department.
The Magistrate informed Police to file the cases soon and take action to punish the wrongdoers.
