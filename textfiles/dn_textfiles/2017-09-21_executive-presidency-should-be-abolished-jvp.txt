Executive Presidency should be abolished: JVP

 
The Executive Presidency should be abolished by the new Constitution in order to guarantee the existence of a vibrant democracy in the country, said Chief Opposition Whip and JVP Parliamentarian Anura Kumara Dissanayake today. 
 He made this observation after Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe presented the Interim Report of the Steering Committee before the Constitutional Assembly, which was held in the Main Chamber of the House of Parliament.
Commencing his speech MP Dissanayake stated that the JVP had a different view over the Constitution.
He said that their party decided to support the process of formulating a new Constitution as they are maintaining that the constitution should be changed.
He added that the electoral system should be changed as well.
"It should be done by the way of a new Constitution and not by any other means," MP Dissanayake said.
"The other matter is that the Executive Presidency should also be changed."
He stated that the 1978 constitution was designed to polarize power around Executive Presidency.
"However 19 amendments have been made to the Constitution since then," MP Dissanayake said.
"The existing government has made Amendments on 17 occasions in order to secure their power."
He said further that the sovereignty of the people, national defence and the people’s rights should be secured by the Constitution.
