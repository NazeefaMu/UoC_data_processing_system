Fisherman ‘clung onto boat’ for a day

Sri Lanka Navy on Wednesday recued a fisherman who clung to his wreaked trawler for a day after it was involved in a collision with a moving ship, about 30 nautical miles off the Galle coast.
The Navy also retrieved the bodies of four others of a total of seven fishermen on board the fishing trawler Malindu Putha.
The trawler had left the Beruwala coast on Tuesday and the accident had occurred early that morning.
Eranda Puspakumara, 26, the fisherman who was rescued, recounting the drama at sea, said after the collision, he was thrown into the sea, while the other fishermen were stuck inside the trawler.
“We did not notice the ship until it collided with our boat. However, I could swim back and cling onto the wrecked boat. I kept on clinging until I was rescued by the Navy the next day.
On information received by the Maritime Rescue Coordinating Centre (MRCC) from a merchant vessel about the ill-fated trawler, a fast attack craft of the Southern Naval Command swiftly launched an operation to rescue the fishermen and their trawler on Wednesday.
The Navy brought the fisherman they rescued to the Galle Harbour and rushed him to the Karapitiya Teaching Hospital for treatment. The dead bodies were handed over to the Galle Police for post-mortem examination.
The Navy is continuing its search operations for the two other missing fishermen.
Meanwhile the Fisheries Department has initiated a comprehensive inquiry into the accident under directions of the Director General.
