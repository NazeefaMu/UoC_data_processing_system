Motorcycles: main cause for fatal accidents - Dr. Kodagoda

Motorcyclists failing to adhere to road rules have resulted in a large number of deaths. The National Council for Road Safety and the Traffic Police Department have shown concern over the increase in road accidents due to motorcycles. The quality of the motorcycle and safety of the children who travel on motorcycles without helmets have become the prime concern of the authorities in order to reduce fatal deaths.
A preliminary study on the condition of the motorcycle would begin in the near future in collaboration with the Moratuwa University's Engineering Faculty, said National Council for Road Safety Chairman Dr Sisira Kodagoda.

According to the Traffic Police Department, there is a vast difference between the conditions of the Japanese manufactured motorcycles and Indian motorcycles.
The durability and brake system of the Japanese motorcycle is in better condition, compared to the Indian motorcycle, while there is also the possibility of Indian motorcycles being thrown away easily, Traffic Police Department sources said.
However, there is also a clear difference in the nature of injury caused to the riders, the sources added.

"It is motorcycles that collide with vehicles very often and it is also the motorcyclists who violate road rules in all possible ways," Dr Kodagoda said.
The Traffic Police Department enforces laws pertaining to road rules, but it is the traffic police officer who experiences the real situation on roads.
Motorcycle riders are those who are hard to handle as they never adhere to road rules, said a Traffic Police officer, who declined to reveal his identity as he had no authority to speak to the media.

According to the police department, the main causes for accidents are careless riding, unable to control vehicles, speeding, overtaking ignoring traffic laws, driving on the right side of the road, drunk driving and cornering carelessly.
Dr Kodagoda said motorcycle riders between the ages of 25 to 40 years, are those who prefer taking up the challenge of riding motorcycles at high speed.
He further said the motivating factor for the riders is that, they are able to move faster on our roads by the use of motorcycles than cars, while buses have to endure traffic jams. Motorcyclists maneuver in between vehicles at the risk to their lives, unmindful of the rights of other road users such as vehicles and pedestrians.

Many riders are not up to standard in riding, especially in busy streets or the suburbs. Inexperienced motorcyclists have led many of them in colliding with vehicles quite often, said sources of the Traffic Department.
According to police statistics, 43 percent of the accidents have occurred when motorcyclists lose control and 49 percent of deaths have occurred due to speeding.
High speed is one of the main reasons for the loss of control, said Dr Kodagoda.

Careless riding is another reason for many accidents, said Dr. Kodagoda.
The Police Department said that motorcyclists and pillion riders should wear authorized head gear, while the chin strap of an authorized helmet protects the rider as well as the pillion rider.
The Police Department intends to strictly implement laws against motorcyclists and pillion riders wearing helmets which violate laws.
Most riders do not use proper helmets. They are unable to see through the helmets. Motorcyclists do not wear authorized helmets. Helmets are thrown away when motorcycles collide with other vehicles. This causes head injuries, said Dr. Kodagoda.
He added that other drivers do not notice motorcycles when they are in front. Therefore, steps are taken to attach light sensitive glow stickers on helmets and motorcycles to enable other drivers to notice the motorcycles travelling in front.
Dr. Kodagoda pointed out that parents who take children on motorcycles without their helmets should consider the dangers of this practice.
Children who travel on motorcycles should wear helmets and parents should make sure that they wear the correct size, he added.
Almost all parents take their children on motorcycles without their helmets. This is very dangerous. They carry infants on motorcycles. Mothers carry babies on one hand and holds on to the motorcycle with the free hand. This is very unsafe, said the traffic police officer.
Dr. Kodagoda said awareness programmes would be conducted for parents on the dangers caused to children riding without helmets.
However, the Traffic Police Department pointed out that according to law, not more than two persons could ride on a motorcycle.
Parents should be cautious as their children's lives are at stake, they said.
Motorcyclists are accused of accidents and deaths that occur due to carelessness. The Traffic Police Department who deal with incidents daily, stressed that it is the carelessness of motorcyclists that lead to deaths.
Police statistics have revealed that 38 percent of the people killed in vehicle accidents are motorcyclists. About 75 percent of pedestrians are killed in accidents caused by motorcyclists.
They do not ride on the proper side of the road and make sudden turns which are reasons for the increase of motorcycle accidents. They do not care for road rules. Some motorcyclists take us for a joke, he added.
Dr. Kodagoda said when vehicles are stopped to let pedestrians cross the road, it is the motorcyclists who move forward first, causing injuries to pedestrians.
He said motorcycles are a convenient mode of transport, but they need to ride safely.
Motorcyclists should understand that it is not only they who are affected due to carelessness, but also threatens the life of pedestrians. However, he said, change in the attitude of riders would reduce fatalities.
"We are planning to strengthen the legal system pertaining to motorcyclists and increase the fines imposed on them. Programmes would be conducted for youths on the dangers of reckless riding, he added.
