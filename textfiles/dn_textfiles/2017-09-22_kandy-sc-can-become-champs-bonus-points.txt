Kandy SC can become champs with bonus points

If Kandy Sports Club wins the game with bonus points, they can become the champions for the first time in the Asian Western Club Championship today at 4 pm at Nittawela grounds, Kandy SC will take on Bahrain Rugby Football Club. Both teams in their first game against Abu Dhabi Harlequins RFC saw Kandy SC draw and Baharain RFC lose.
This match is all about taking opportunities. It’s an opportunity for the Kandy SC players to grow individually and collectively as a team, if they do so, today they should have things to their own liking.
Kandy SC has taken a lesson from last Fridays game at the same venue and now it’s an opportunity to take those learning’s into this match. Head coach Sean Wijesinghe has made the Kandy SC a dynamic, physical team who are growing in their style of game.
Bahrain RFC will try their best to come out on top in this important match. They have been a dominant force in the early years of the Gulf Leagues in 1980s and continued to reign as the region’s premier side through most of the next decade, winning 13 titles in that time.
Since 1994 Kandy SC has won the league on 17 occasions, especially due to the backing of Mr. Rugby Malik Samarawickrama and the players. At present the club has some notable players including players who have represented the country internationally.
