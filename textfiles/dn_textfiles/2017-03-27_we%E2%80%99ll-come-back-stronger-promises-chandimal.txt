We’ll come back stronger promises Chandimal

DAMBULLA: Vice-captain Dinesh Chandimal who was the only stand-out batsman with Thisara Perera in Sri Lanka’s crushing 90-run defeat at the hands of Bangladesh in the first ODI played here on Saturday has promised a better performance in the second ODI of the three-match series scheduled at the same venue for Tuesday.
“The defeat is very painful. We are a young group and hopefully they will learn soon and do the right things in the next game,” said Chandimal at the post-match press conference.
The defeat follows the one in the second Test match where Bangladesh recorded their maiden Test win over Sri Lanka in 18 Tests. Saturday’s ODI win was Bangladesh’s fifth against Sri Lanka in 39 matches and their second on Lankan soil.
“You can’t say every time that this is our transition period. We need to put our hands up and come up with results. All the players should take responsibility from the opportunities they get. Everyone is working hard towards it and hopefully we will be able to see the results soon,” said Chandimal.
“We have some game plans up our sleeves and we are looking forward to execute them. We are looking forward to improve on our mistakes and come back stronger,” he said.
Chandimal admitted that the absence of skipper Angelo Mathews along with that of Niroshan Dickwella and Kusal Perera had somewhat weakened the batting.
“Dickwella has been our in-form batsman and Angelo is our best batsman. It’s a big blow that we don’t have them and Kusal. We are a young team and when we miss some of those guys that is a huge blow. As a team we need to make most of the opportunities,” said Chandimal.
Mathews and Perera are nursing injuries while Dickwella served out the second of his two-match ICC ban for dissension in the first ODI and will be available for the second game on Tuesday.
Chandimal put down Bangladesh’s win to the experienced one-day players they have in their side.
“Since I came into the side we have been beating them easily. But if you take the modern day Bangladesh side they have seven to eight players who have been playing international cricket. They have a lot of experience as this group has been playing together,” observed Chandimal.
With Sri Lanka’s fielding continuing to falter on the field Chandimal was hopeful that it would improve with time.
“We were awful on the field. If we had restricted them to about 280, then we could have done something. But we were sloppy on the field,” said Chandimal.
“We do lot of training with regard to fielding. There’s pressure when we come into the game. There are several young players and there could be mistakes. But we are doing our training well and we are looking forward to sharpening our fielding in the next two games,” he said.
Chandimal defended the decision of not including a specialist off-spinner in the side against Bangladesh’s left-handers in the top order.
“Asela (Gunaratne) can bowl off-spin as well. We wanted Dhanushka (Gunathilaka) to get a few overs as well. We thought that the both of them were able to do the job although we didn’t have a specialist off-spinner in the side,” said Chandimal.
Instead Sri Lanka played two left-arm spin all-rounders – Sachith Pathirana and Milinda Siriwardana and none of them was made full use of. Pathirana sent down only five overs and Siriwardana didn’t get a bowl at all. The result was a match-winning record partnership of 144 runs between left-handers Tamim Iqbal and Shakib Al Hasan.
