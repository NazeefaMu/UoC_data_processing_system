Plantation strike cripples tea, rubber industries

The plantation workers’ strike demanding Rs.1,000 wage increment continues for the fourth day without a solution, despite several round of talks the authorised unions had with the plantation companies. The CWC, the LJEWU and the JPTUC are the unions agitating for the wage increase. All workers belonging to the unions have joined the strike, cripling the entire tea and rubber indusry.
Work on estates in Hatton, Bogawantalawa, Maskeliya, Talawakelle, Diyagama, Nuwara Eliya, Nawalapitiya, Kandy and Matale have come to a standstill.
CWC President Arumugan Thondaman has called on all plantation unions to cooperate with the management of their companies.
