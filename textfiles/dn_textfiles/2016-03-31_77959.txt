Pandey replaces injured Yuvraj

The ICC has confirmed that the Event Technical Committee of the ICC World Twenty20 India 2016 has approved Manish Pandey as a replacement player for Yuvraj Singh in India's squad for the tournament.
Yuvraj twisted his ankle while batting in the previous match against Australia in Mohali and has been ruled out of further participation in the tournament.
The 26-year-old Pandey has played two T20Is, which were against Zimbabwe in Harare in July last year. He has also played four ODIs.
2007 champion India will take on 2012 winner the West Indies in the second semi-final at the Wankhede Stadium in Mumbai on Thursday.
