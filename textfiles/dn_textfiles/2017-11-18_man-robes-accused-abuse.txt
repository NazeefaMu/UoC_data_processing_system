Man in robes accused of abuse

Panadura Provincial High Court Judge Padmini Ranawaka Gunatilleke told a lawyer appearing in a sexual abuse case against a man in robes on Thursday, that the law of the country is equal to all citizens and that no extraordinary treatment is granted for members of the clergy.
The accused had allegedly committed a sexual offence on an underage boy who had visited the temple.
“Bhikkus must live in society upholding Buddhist principles. However, certain Bhikkus are not adhering to it but engage in nefarious activities and come before Court.
The laity is committed to safeguarding the Buddha Sasana rather than some Bhikkus,” the Judge said.
“Bhikkus must lead an exemplary life respecting the Buddha Sasana,” the Judge added. The Attorney General indicted the man in robes residing at a temple in Kuda Uduwa in Horana with committing a sexual offence on a 16-year-old boy in December 2008. The lawyer moved that this case can be compounded. State Counsel K. V. Indika strongly objected to this application and told Court that the case could be fixed for trial. The Judge refused the application of the defence lawyer and fixed the case for trial on January 15, 2018.
The accused is on bail.
