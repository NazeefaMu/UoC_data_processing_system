Michael Carberry hits a ton on return to cricket after cancer treatment

Former England batsman Michael Carberry made a hundred for Hampshire on his maiden first class appearance since being diagnosed with cancer.
The 36-year-old was told he had a cancerous tumour last summer and immediately started treatment, with his last first-class appearance coming on July 8.
Carberry, who made six Test appearances for England, returned to training with his county over the winter, having undergone a successful operation.
He marked his return to the middle in some style, scoring exactly 100 from 121 balls as Hampshire faced Cardiff MCCU at the Rose Bowl.
He was given a standing ovation as he left the field, his knock ending when he found the hands of Matthew Norris off the bowling of David O’Sullivan.
Carberry has enjoyed an outstanding pre-season, scoring a century in an inter-squad friendly, two fifties on tour and smashed a 41-ball 78 as Hampshire amassed 255 for eight in a T20 win against Durham University. In a statement released last week thanked those who helped him recover and resume his cricket career, Carberry said: ‘I would like to thank my family, the club, the supporters and my team-mates worldwide for all the kind messages of support and love through another very tough time in my career and life. ‘There is still a long way to go to being ‘recovered’ fully, but the outpouring of support from the cricket family has helped massively in getting me back playing and I’m looking forward to another great summer with Hampshire.
‘In regards to the media, I would like to thank them for respecting my privacy in dealing with my illness and I would like to ask for this to continue on my return.’ – Daily Mail
