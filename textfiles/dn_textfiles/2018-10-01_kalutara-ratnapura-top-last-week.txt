BoC Thurunu Diriya loan recipients
Kalutara, Ratnapura top last week

The highest number of youth who received Bank of Ceylon Thurunu Diriya loans under the Enterprise Sri Lanka Project in the last week of September was recorded in the Kalutara and Ratnapura districts, according to the latest progress review reports, the Policy Development Office of the Prime Minister's Office in a statement issued on September 29 said.
Fourteen loan-assisted projects have been launched in the districts up to September 26. The Western Province has 33 projects started with the loans and 136 loans were issued to date - 11 per cent increase compared to the number of loans issued in the previous week.
The Thurunu Diriya loan scheme had become very popular among youth entrepreneurs since it has very simple surety scheme and low interest rate.
The scheme empowers youth entrepreneurs who hold a degree or approved vocational skills certificate. The details of the loan scheme are available from the Bank of Ceylon branches or the Divisional Secretariat offices.
