Attack on Rohingya shelter : Ven. Akmeemana, another remanded

Ven. Akmeemana Dayarathna Thera and Ravindra Warnajith Perera who were summoned to the Colombo Crime Division (CCD) yesterday morning in connection to the attack on the Rohingya safe house in Mt Lavinia last week, have been remanded. The two suspects who surrendered to the CCD around 9 am yesterday, were questioned for over five hours prior to their arrests.
The Police media unit in a statement released to the media stated that Perera was a 40-year-old resident of Gangodawila, Nugegoda and the two were produced before the Mt Lavinia Magistrate’s Court later that day and subsequently remanded till October 9.
With the newly arrested duo yesterday, police have arrested eight suspects in connection with the attack on the Rohingya. The six arrested earlier have been remanded until October 9.
The 31 Rohingya refugees, mostly women and children who were evacuated from the safe house in Mt Lavinia were moved to the Boosa Detention Camp in Galle last week for greater protection. Certain extremist groups however had declared that they would hold a protest outside the camp over the refugees being given shelter there. The police which sprung into action after much criticism over their actions during the Mt Lavinia attack have been successful in obtaining a court order against any protest before the camp and had deployed close to 600 km policemen to guard a perimeter of 2 km around the camp.
