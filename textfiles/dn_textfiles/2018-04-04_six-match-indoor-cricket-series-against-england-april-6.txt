Six-match Indoor Cricket Series against England from April 6

The Sri Lanka Indoor cricket team will take on the visiting England counterparts in a six-match Indoor Cricket Series from April 6 to 8 at the Austasia International Stadium, Thalawathugoda.
This is the third time an English indoor cricket team is visiting Sri Lanka since their first visit in 2003 for a three-match series where Sri Lanka emerged winners 3-nil.
The second England indoor team visited Sri Lanka for the 2004 World Cup.
This year the Sri Lankan team will be coached by Asela Pathirana who captained the Lankan team on both previous occasions against England.
The team will be led by experienced Kamal Kuruppu and will have Kolitha Hapuarachchi as his deputy. The Lankan team has been training hard since February after their return from the Asia Cup in India where they became runner-up.
The six-match test series has been sanctioned by the World Indoor Cricket Federation (WICF). In addition, England will also bring a development team and a Masters’ team who will be seen in action in few friendly encounters against local teams.
