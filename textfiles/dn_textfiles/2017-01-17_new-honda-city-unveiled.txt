New Honda City unveiled

While the SUV/Crossover craze is still growing in the Indian automotive market, the Honda City had been the consumer favourite in its segment for a long time. But with competitors like the Maruti Suzuki Ciaz (also getting a facelift later this year), the revised Skoda Rapid and the Volkswagen Vento catching up, Honda felt the City could do with a mid-life facelift and evoke buyer interest.
The new City gets some very obvious cosmetic updates, with the chrome band running across the grille and the nose and chin looks more like the latest generation of the Civic. The front bumper has more prominent sections for the air dam and the housings for the fog lamps, with a restyled grille as well. It looks the same as the current model in side profile, though. The headlights now house LED daytime running lamps, while the tail-lamps have also been slightly tweaked. It also gets sporty new 16inch alloys, though that’s probably only in the top trim.
Mechanically, Honda has made no changes to the City which will still be powered by the same old 1.5-litre petrol and 1.5-litre diesel engines, but there is a minor update to the suspension compared to the current model. Features like ABS and dual airbags will come as standard, while the major equipment upgrade would be the new infotainment system with Android Auto. Top-of-the-line variants will get leather seats and a soft-touch dashboard. There are also reports of the ZX-badged variant being reintroduced in the Indian market.
While prices for the current City start from Rs 8.8 lakh (ex-showroom, Mumbai), expect Honda to charge a slight premium for the revised models.
