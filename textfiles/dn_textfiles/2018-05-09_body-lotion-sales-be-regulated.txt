Body lotion sales to be regulated

A law to regulate the sale of body lotions used for skin care is to be introduced by the Consumer Affairs Authority soon.
The law will stipulate that the ingredients and the quota of the lotion to be applied on the body at a time should be indicated in the label of the bottle or vial containing the lotion.
Consumer Affairs Authority Chairman Hasitha Tillakaratne said he had already signed the relevant gazette notification to be released shortly.
The producers and importers of these lotions would be given a respite of six months to conform to its stipulations.
This decision was taken because the authority had found certain lotions in the market to be sub-standard and harmful to the skin.
