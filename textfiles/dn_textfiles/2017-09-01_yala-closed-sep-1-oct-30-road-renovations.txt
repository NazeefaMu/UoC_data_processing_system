Yala closed from Sep 1 to Oct 30 for road renovations

The Yala National Park will be kept closed from September 1 until October 30, according to Park Warden D. P. Sriyasinha.
The park will be kept closed for the renovation of interior roads of the Yala National Park and to allow wild beasts to engage themselves in breeding activities without hindrance.
The park warden said the reservoirs and potholes in the National Park have dried up almost to the bottom and wild beasts experience an acute shortage of drinking water.
He said wildlife officials engage themselves in providing drinking water to them utilizing solar panels and that the water of Menik Ganga is being used for this purpose.
