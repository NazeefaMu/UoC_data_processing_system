The ‘Global Alliance for Trade Facilitation: Making Cross - Border Trade Easier for Sri Lankan Business,’ forum organised by the Global Alliance for Trade Facilitation and the International Chamber of Commerce Sri Lanka (ICCSL) will be held on April 26, 2017 at the Cinnamon Grand Colombo.

The forum will be held at Oak Room in Cinnamon Grand Hotel at 9.30 a.m. The Forum will include trade-related speeches, one on ‘Private Sector's Role in Trade Facilitation' and another on ‘Sri Lanka's potential to boost trade with private sector leadership'- by two eminent foreign speakers with experience from the Global Alliance for Trade Facilitation and from the private sector. The speech on ‘Private Sector's Role in Trade Facilitation’ will be delivered by Mr. Eric T. Miller, the Trade Expert and Senior Advisor of the Global Alliance for Trade Facilitation.
Minister of Industry of Commerce Rishad Bathiudeen will deliver the Keynote Speech at the forum.
Ms. Donia Hammami, the Vice President of Global Alliance for Trade Facilitation and Head Customs and Trade Facilitation of ICC will grace the event as the Guest of Honour.
ICCSL Chairman Keerthi Gunawardane, who will moderate the Panel Discussion and Open Forum, said the attending business experts will highlight on the unique opportunities of the Trade Facilitation Agreement (TFA) which will bring in all relevant stakeholders together for effective and commercially meaningful trade facilitation reforms.
“Swift implementation of the TFA will make it hassle free and less costly for members of the Sri Lankan business community to engage in cross-border trade leading to inclusive growth, sustainable development and increased government revenue,” Gunawardane elaborated.
The TFA of the World Trade Organization (WTO) provides a unique opportunity to promote inclusive growth by making cross-border trade easier, quicker and less costly for businesses of all sizes.
Speakers at the Forum will provide perspectives on the importance of TFA implementation to support economic growth, investment and the empowerment of small and medium-sized enterprises.
The Global Alliance for Trade Facilitation which is co-organising the event is an innovative public-private partnership between the World Economic Forum, the International Chamber of Commerce, the Center for International Private Enterprise and the Governments of Australia, Canada, Germany, the United Kingdom and the United States.
It aims to advance effective implementation of the TFA for creating opportunities for broad-based economic growth.
ICCSL Chairman Keerthi Gunawardane requested the members of the business community and all those who are interested in taking part in this inclusive and informative Forum on TFA to contact the organisers at earliest.
“There will be a few seats available for the general public who are interested in trade to participate in the forum. However, theywill be selected on a first come first serve basis due to high demand and limited seating,” Gunawardane added.
