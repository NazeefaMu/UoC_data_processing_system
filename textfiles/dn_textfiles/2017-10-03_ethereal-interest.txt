Ethereal interest

Having gone to Art school in Oxford University very late at the age of 48, Elizabeth Porter did her MA at the Royal College of Arts also in London. Her degree was in Fine Arts. Elizabeth Porter has an interest in how animals relate with human beings. The animal and the man made. Most of her paintings are about animals. Daily News spoke to artist Elizabeth Porter who says she is interested in things that are slightly overlooked by people.
“I perform as well as paint. I also do drawings and sculpture. I am interested in things that are quite small and in some ways not ordinary. But things that are ethereal. I have been painting since I was five years old. I have also done many exhibitions that are all slightly different to each other. Even though I am based in London, I have done exhibitions in Beijing, Germany and South of France. But mostly in London,” said Porter.
Porter admits she paints in a very traditional manner. I even look back into the medieval. Like Fra Angelico. Even Medieval artists interest her. One feature in her paintings are that they are very portable, as in you can pick it up and put it in your bag. Even before Porter went to University she had a training in Chinese style of painting and lacquer. Her work is also from across the world. There is a small art school in Oxford University called the ‘Ruskin’. Oxford takes in 3000 students every year but there are only 30 arts students. They are all over the University. Nearly everyone in the group that Porter was in were in the age range of 19s. She was the only student in her 40s. Porter admits that in some way she felt lonely. However porter points out that they were so kind to her and she learnt so much from them.
“Particularly in a city, we try to exclude animals. And we are not entirely successful. We try to police animals in the way we do ourselves. If you take small animals, they don’t see the world as we see it. They do not see the glass and the concrete. In London we have pigeons everywhere. They don’t see the city. They see it as cliffs where they breed. What would a bird make of a gun? It would see a branch or a tree. I really don’t know but I am interested in putting the animal and the man- made together. Put it besides each other. I want to ask the viewer questions,” explained Porter.
Her message for someone who wants to take up art is simply to do it. Don’t think about it. Just do it. One of her favorites ever, is a tiny painting in the National Gallery of London. The front has angels depicted and Richard the III that makes it 15th century. “But the bit that I like is the animal on the back. It is not important. It is just a deer on the back. I am interested in the things that you might not notice. Things that are just behind. Even in the Barefoot Café there are so many varieties of birds and even squirrels, and people don’t notice them,” said Porter.
Art school was so much fun for her! Interestingly enough Porter calls herself ‘very quiet and very shy’ during her formative years. She recalls that she once went to an interview and she simply could not speak! A lot of us can relate to Elizabeth Porter. Sometimes we are so shy that we are simply unable to speak! Painting is now Porter’s bread and butter. She paints to earn a living and she loves to work.
“To go to arts school and be with other artists for three years in Oxford, that is an amazing experience. I have always had a very rich fantasy life. One reason I went into fantasy maybe because of my introverted nature. I lived in a very tiny village in the middle of a country side. I had a lot of time on my own with dogs and cats. I was in the farmland In the middle of nowhere. There was an airport nearby and I would walk around the woods. And I remember that planes would fly over my head! And I felt that I could touch them. The books I liked as a child were the Narnia Chronicles. I am quite a leader. I loved that,” said Porter.
A sensitive woman she feels so powerless when she hears about war. So there is a small reference to it in her mind.
“In a city small animals are everywhere and is see a certain beauty in their circumstances. Things that really people have discarded. Some of my paintings are pretty random,” said Porter.
Porter calls herself mostly spiritual and that she was brought up as Catholic even though she does not belong to any denomination. And she says that there is always something that can break inside of us and needs care and needs love. Like a small animal might. I am interested in being creative generally. I am not in one particular way of expression.
“I am interested in my own dreams and what happens in them. They are full of animals. I am more interested in things that are more animal and less human. I don’t know but my dreams are like that,” said Porter.
