Former Navy Spokesman further remanded till December 13

 
Former Navy Spokesman Commodore D.K.P Dassanayake and five others who were arrested for aiding and abetting the abduction and disappearance of 11 youths in 2008 and 2009 were today ordered to be further remanded till December 13 by Colombo Fort Magistrate Lanka Jayaratne. At a previous occasion, the court had issued an order directing the Superintendent of Welikada Prison that former Navy Spokesman Commodore D.K.P Dassanayake be transferred to the Prison Hospital from Welikada Navy Hospital. The Magistrate made this order taking into consideration a request made by both prosecution and aggrieved party of the case alleging that seventh suspect D.K.P. Dassanayake was enjoying special privileges while being at Welisara Navy Hospital contrary to the normal prison procedure.
Former Navy Spokesman was not produced in court by prison authorities citing that he is currently receiving treatment at a hospital.
On July 12, the CID arrested the former Navy Spokesman at the Sri Lanka Navy base in Welisara following an investigation into the incident.
