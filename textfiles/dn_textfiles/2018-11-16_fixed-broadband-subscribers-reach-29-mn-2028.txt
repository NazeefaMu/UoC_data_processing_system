fixed broadband subscribers to reach 2.9 mn by 2028

Sri Lanka’s fixed broadband subscribers could reach 2.9 million by 2028, Associate Research Analyst at Kagan and author of the research, Wangxing Zhao, said in a report.
He said that the rise in fixed broadband service adoption is due to strong economic growth and poverty reduction in Sri Lanka. Sri Lanka’s fixed broadband customer base reached 1.2 million connections in 2017, first time ever hitting the 1 million mark. Broadband penetration increased from just 1.3% in 2007 to 22.1% by 2017 year-end, the highest among its regional peers in South Asia the report said.
“We expect Sri Lanka’s fixed broadband subscribers will grow over the next 10 years, reaching 2.9 million by 2028, a 47.1% penetration rate.”
He said that Fiber would become the leading platform in Sri Lanka over the next 10 years, while Digital Subscriber Line (DSL) subscribers will shrink.
As of 2017, DSL remained the dominant fixed broadband platform in Sri Lanka, serving an estimated 606,000 subscribers, nearly half of the market. Fixed wireless and fiber currently serves around 447,000 and 167,000 customers, respectively.
“We expect fixed wireless to become the most adopted broadband technology by 2020. However, fiber is anticipated to take over fixed wireless as the leading platform.”
“Our model indicates both fiber and fixed wireless services will each serve more than 1 million subscribers by 2028, whereas DSL subscribers will start to decline.”
