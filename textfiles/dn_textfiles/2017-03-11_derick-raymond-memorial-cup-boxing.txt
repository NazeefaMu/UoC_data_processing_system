Derick Raymond Memorial Cup boxing

St. Sylvester’s College, one time king makers of the boxing ring will hold their Inter-House boxing tournament after many years on March 18 Saturday thanks to the efforts of the 2006 batch of Sylvestrians, who have come forward to organize this meet.
Former national champion Nimal Lewke will be the chief guest. This school has a history where they have produced some of the brilliant boxers this country has ever seen. In the 1960s and early 1970s, they really dominated the Stubbs Shield inter-schools boxing, and many of their boxers were in the Sri Lanka School Boxing teams that took part in the dual competition with Indian Schools for the M D Gunasena Trophy during that period.
This was the time Derick Raymond who was stationed at Peradeniya University as a Marshall, was in-charge of St. Sylvester’s boxing. He produced brilliant boxers, who as schoolboys went on to win National Championship and even represented Sri Lanka in Commonwealth Games and Olympics. It is a fitting tribute to a person who has contributed so much to Sri Lanka boxing to be recognized and at this inter-house meet a trophy in memory of the late boxing guru Derick Raymond will be awarded to the champion house team. It was the idea of Nimal Lewke (the last National champion produced by Derick Raymond) to donate the trophy in memory of a most respected boxing coach. Raymond migrated to Australia in the early 1970s and later to UK where he passed away few years back.
The following trophies will be presented at the meet: Malcolm Bulner Challenge Trophy for Best Boxer, Derrick Gunasinghe Memorial Trophy for Junior Best Boxer and Nimal Lewke Challenge Trophy for Up and Coming Boxer.
