Farmers threaten to surround Agriculture Ministry

Farmers will surround the Agriculture Ministry on April 12, if they do not receive the compensation for their harvest affected by the prolonged drought.
According to The All Island Agrarian Services Confederation Convenor Namal Karunaratne, the farmers have decided to resort to stern action if the government fails to pay the compensation to them as promised.
“Today, the farmers are standing in long queues at banks to pawn their valuables to find money to celebrate the New Year,” he said.
President of the United Rice Producers Association Mudhith Perera said the people will have to use imported rice to make Kiribath for the New Year for the first time. He further said one of the largest rice producing mills is retaining expired rice.
“They mix the local and imported rice and sell it for a higher price and those rice stocks are being sold in many stores today,” he said.
