S.Thomas College Mount Lavinia ruggerite cum second row forward Harith Senanayake touched down for a try in the last move of the day carrying out an excellent second half rally, where they came back after holding on to a 19 all score line to beat the fighting D.S.Senanayake College Colombo side by 24 points ( 4 tries, 2 conversions) to 19 ( 3 tries, 2 conversions) in their Singer ‘B’ Division inter-schools league rugby second round Plate championship match played at Havelock Park yesterday.
