Break-in at MP Arundika’s house
Suspect remanded till August 10

The suspect who had illegally entered the official residence of MP Arundika Fernando, was ordered to be remanded until August 10 by Nugegoda Acting Magistrate P. Manchanayake on Sunday.
The suspect is said to be a driver under State Minister Radhakrishnan and a resident of the Hatton area.
He had reportedly entered the first floor of MP Arundika Fernando’s residence in Madiwela, around 2.30 am, last Saturday. The parliamentarian’s brother-in-law and four other relatives had been in the house at the time of the incident, police said.
Mirihana Police said that a female relative had witnessed the man on the balcony and they had subsequently notified the police post, after which measures were taken to arrest the suspect, who was intoxicated at the time.
Preliminary investigations had revealed that the suspect may have broken into the residence of the MP with the intention of stealing from him. However, MP Fernando had not been present at the time of the break-in.
State Minister Radhakrishnan had told police that although the said driver worked under him previously, currently, he was not working for him and if he had violated the law, he should be punished.
