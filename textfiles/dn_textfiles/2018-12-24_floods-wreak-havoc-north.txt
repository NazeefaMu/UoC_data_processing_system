Floods wreak havoc in North

The heavy rains wreaked havoc and displaced many families living in areas such as Peraru, Manankandal, Karuwalakandal and Kanakapuram in Mullaitivu, as well as Udayarkattu South in Pudukuduirippu. Troops of the Mullativu 64 and 68 Divisions rushed to the aid of flood victims and provided them shelter. Pictures by Bandula Senevirathne, Vavuniya North Group Corr.
