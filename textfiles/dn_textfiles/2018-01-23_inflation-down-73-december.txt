Inflation down to 7.3% in December

Issuing National Consumer Price Index (NCPI) for December 2017, Director General of Census and Statistics Dr. Amara Satharasinghe said that the year-on-year inflation based on NCPI has declined to 7.3% from 8.4% in November 2017.
Before inflation decreased to 7.3% in December 2017, over 8.0% inflation was reported for three months (November, October, September of 2017) consecutively. Contributions to the inflation in December 2017 from food group and non-food group are 5.7% and 1.6% respectively, whilst contributions of these two groups to the inflation in December 2016 were 1.0% and 3.2% respectively, resulting in headline inflation of 4.2%, which reflect comparatively lower food prices particularly prices of coconuts and vegetables, in December 2016.
However, when compared to month-on-month changes, NCPI in December2017 has increased to 126.6 from 126.4 reported in November 2017. This shows an increase of 0.2 index points or 0.2 percentage points in December 2017 as compared to November 2017. This month-on-month change was due to the increases of expenditure value of food items by 0.12% and non-food items by 0.03% respectively.
The increase in expenditure value of food items was due to the price increases of vegetables, fresh fish, red onions, coconuts, papaw, eggs, coconut oil and tea dust. However, decreases in expenditure value in index were reported for rice, green chilies, banana, mysore dhal, potatoes, limes and dried fish.
The increase in expenditure value of non-food items in December 2017 compared to the previous month was due to the expenditure value increases in groups of ‘Transport’ and ‘Clothing and Footwear’.
Further, the groups of ‘Furnishing, Household equipment and Routine household maintenance’, ‘Restaurant and Hotels’ and ‘Miscellaneous Goods and Services’ recorded very slight expenditure value increases compared to the preceding month.
The expenditure value of ‘Housing, Water, Electricity, Gas and Other fuels’, ‘Health’, ‘Communication’, ‘Recreation and Culture’ and ‘Education’ groups remained unchanged during the month.
