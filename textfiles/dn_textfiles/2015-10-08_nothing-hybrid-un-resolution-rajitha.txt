Nothing hybrid in UN resolution - Rajitha

Cabinet Spokesman Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne said there was nothing hybrid in the UN resolution because if it was a hybrid court, Jayalalitha, Karunanidhi and the others who supported the LTTE will never protest against it.
Dr. Senaratne addressing the weekly Cabinet press briefing at the Government Information Department yesterday said the mechanism was entirely domestic and this was why pro-LTTE elements opposed it. He said during former President Mahinda Rajapaksa's time a request was made for an International Court.
Three foreign judges took part in formulating the Paranagama Report. Everything now happens according to the law of Sri Lanka and under the Sri Lankan Judiciary, Dr. Senaratne said.
He said according to the resolution, everything will be done after discussions with the Sri Lankan government. "It is the Sri Lankan government which decides what to do and how to do. The Sri Lankan government is the decision maker," he said.
"The need to amend the Sri Lankan law depends on what the Sri Lankan government expects from foreign experts. There is no hurry and everything will be done during a period of one year or more," the minister said.
