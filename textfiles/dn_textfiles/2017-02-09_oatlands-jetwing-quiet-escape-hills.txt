OATLANDS BY JETWING: Quiet escape to the hills

Adding to Jetwing Hotels exquisite villa collection is Oatlands by Jetwing – a British colonial style bungalow cradled amidst the mist covered highlands of Nuwara Eliya. With spectacular sights over a valley with constantly changing panoramic views, invigorating climate, and landscaped tea plantations, Oatlands by Jetwing is a quiet escape into the hill country.
The drive up to Oatlands by Jetwing is a scenic one, with lush greenery, waterfalls, tea plantations and majestic mountains. It is approximately 170 km (5 hours) from the Bandaranaike International Airport and is a short stroll away from the town and the famous Jetwing St. Andrew’s.
Built in the early 1920s during the British rule, the property is a comfortably furnished and well-equipped bungalow, opening towards ½ an acre of private garden space perfect for family getaways and romantic escapes. The villa echoes classic colonial architecture with carpeted wooden floors, bed chambers, and tall drapes fitting into the old-world charm and the feeling of warmth the property promises for its guests.
Oatlands by Jetwing is a colonial style bungalow with four bedrooms inclusive of individual heating units, dressed in crisp white linen and furnished with modern amenities such as tea and coffee making facilities, an electric safe, iron and ironing board and a hair dryer.
They also come with attached bathrooms equipped with hot and cold water. In addition, all four rooms provide easy access to the main hall featuring an authentic fireplace, and to the dining room. Experience the warmth of the property while you sit down for your meals at the cozy dining room or be at ease when you opt for al fresco dining in the garden amidst the cool weather. As a guest of Oatlands by Jetwing you are also welcome to dine in at any food and beverage outlet of your choice at Jetwing St Andrew’s, which is only a short walk away.
There’s much to explore in Nuwara Eliya, for the adventurous souls a walk into the town will take you to shops selling fresh local produce and vendors displaying their lovely collection of bright and colourful flowers. Known as ‘Little England’, much of the colonial influence is seen in Nuwara Eliya. The Racecourse, Golf Club and the red bricked post office are residues of a bygone era which are now viewed as architectural masterpieces.
From a trek to Horton Plains, a visit to the Hakgala Botanical Gardens or Ambewala Farm, there’s much to see up in Nuwara Eliya. Providing a unique experience is the naturalist at Jetwing St. Andrew’s, who enthusiastically takes you on a ‘Frog Trail’ excursion in the night allowing you to spot up to 10 species of frogs in their natural habitat along with many other night creatures. An extended stay in Nuwara Eliya will give you a dose of adventure followed by days of leisurely comforts.
