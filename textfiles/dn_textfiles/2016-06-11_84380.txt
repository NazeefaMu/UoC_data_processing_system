No need to take up NCM against Parliament SG: Parliamentary Business Committee

The Parliamentary Business Committee decided that there was no need to take up the No Confidence Motion (NCM) against the Secretary General of Parliament as he had not made any deliberate efforts to distort the results of the vote on the Supplementary Estimate on May 5, 2016, announced Speaker Karu Jayasuriya.
The Speaker observed that the Parliamentary Business Committee reached this decision after taking into consideration the report submitted by the committee appointed by him to investigate into the issue arisen during the vote on the Supplementary Estimate on May 5,2015.
Making a special announcement in Parliament, he made this observation and said that the Secretary General had already expressed his regrets to him (the Speaker).
The Speaker also observed that a mistake in counting the votes taken in Parliament had happened in many other places in the world. He added that it was wrong for some MPs to interpret the recent voting fiasco in Parliament as the first such incident of its kind.
The Speaker said that there had been three earlier occasions of vote counting mistakes in our Parliament. Such mistakes had been rectified later. In the Parliament of Great Britain, there had been 11 such miscounting incidents.
The Speaker said that he had received the committee report appointed by him to investigate the mistake of voting in Parliament on May 5, 2016.The committee comprised Opposition Leader R Sampanthan, former Speaker Chamal Rajapaksa, Urban Planning and Water Supply Minister Rauff Hakeem and Justice and Buddhasasana Minister Wijayadasa Rajapakshe.
According to the report, the error in counting occurred because of MPs coming to the Chamber at various times while the vote was being taken. The MPs had come into the Chamber at three separate occasions while the process of vote taking was in progress. The officials had included late comers too and there had been a human error and a mistake occurred in that process.
However, there had been no deliberate intention to distort the vote results.
The Speaker said that the committee was of the view that during the last few months the conduct of some MPs had been unruly, aggressive and hostile.
The committee in its report under the subheading general observations says:
“If there will be a continuation of this kind of conduct, there will be an erosion of public confidence reposed in Parliament and the democratic system of governance. Such a situation might eventually eat into the vitals of the democratic principles and norms. Hence the committee recommends that
stringent measures should be taken to uphold the discipline and to maintain the decorum of Parliament.”
“The committee recommends that the issue is a noteworthy matter to be resolved, by a discussion at the party leaders’ meeting in the interests of the parliamentary system. If no consensus is arrived at, in considering circumstances under which the uncertainty has arisen, we recommend to hold a fresh counting vote.
“When a bill or a resolution is presented to Parliament, the Minister in charge of the subject concerned (including the officials) shall act in due diligence and appraise the House with clarity the nature and the purpose of the Bill or resolution.
“The ringing of Division Bell to indicate the voting of members must be continued for five minutes.
“When voting had been fixed at a particular time, the House shall not commence voting before the fixed time even if the debate is concluded.
House may be adjourned till the time fixed for voting.
“At the time of voting, in the absence of the Speaker, the Deputy Speaker shall preside and conduct the voting in the House.
“Members of the Speaker’s Panel shall be given a special training to develop their skills”.
“Officials of Parliament shall not engage with MPs or any outsider to evaluate or examine the conduct in the House or any other related matter unless there shall be a direction from the Speaker.
“Stringent measures should be taken to uphold the discipline and maintain the decorum of Parliament.
“The existing Standing Orders may be revised appropriately to meet the above mentioned requirement.”
Speaker Jayasuriya said that he had received a written apology from the Secretary General of Parliament.
The Speaker also said that MPs Wimal Weerawansa and Sisira Jayakody met him and appologised over their conduct and behavior at the time of incident,” the Speaker said.
The Speaker emphasised that the cooperation of all MPs was needed when a vote in Parliament was taken and the Board of Secretary General too should take utmost care in counting with the assistance from the Chair.
