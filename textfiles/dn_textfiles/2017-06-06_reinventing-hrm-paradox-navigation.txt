Reinventing HRM as paradox navigation

Following is the text of the Prof. Sudatta Ranasinghe memorial oration on May 25 delivered by Prof. Ajantha S. Dharmasiri, Director, Postgraduate Institute of Management (PIM), at the PIM Auditorium.
Prof Sudatta Ranasinghe wrote in HR Challenge: “In contemporary organizations HR currently plays the role of a business partner only to a limited extent due to reasons such as lack of capacity and authority of HR to influence strategic level business decisions. “ This was one factor that was repeatedly highlighted in many HR researches done in Sri Lanka. On one side, the CEOs lament that “my HR person knows HR and not business”. On the other side, the HR person laments that “I am not given enough exposure in business decisions”. I named these two aspects as competency deficit and opportunity deficit in my doctoral studies. The time is opportune to reinvent HRM. One key element in such an endavour is to have clarity of what really HRM is all about.
We can see hundreds of different ways of describing HRM. Some are over simplistic whilst some others are highly scholastic. What could be the best way to approach HRM in defining it related to local needs? A think tank from the Institute of Personnel Management (IPM) took the initiative of developing a suitable definition of HRM for Sri Lanka. This move was very significant as IPM being the pioneering and premier HR institute in Sri Lanka, is moving towards a Charter status. Of course, we missed the “would have been wonderful” contribution of late Prof. Ranasinghe.
Our approach was specific and straightforward. We looked at what is available in terms of HRM definitions, identified key salient points in those and listed them and brainstormed of their relevance to Sri Lanka. That was one aspect. On the other hand, we also brainstormed how to accommodate the socio-cultural and religio-political dimensions influencing management practices in Sri Lanka. Our aim was to find the best fit.
Based on the brainstorming we had as a team and feedback obtained from professionals and professors, the following definition emerged. A strategic and integrated approach in acquisition, development and engagement of talent, using relevant tools, with proper policies, practices and processes in creating a conducive climate towards achieving organizational excellence and societal well-being.
Goals and specific objectives
What we meant by strategic is working towards achieving overall goals and specific objectives of the organization. It is essentially aligning with the broad organizational priorities. It highlights the strategic significance of HRM and the holistic role it should play.
Talent refers to three Cs going in line with Prof. Dave Ulrich, a prolific researcher of HRM from the Michigan University. They are competence, commitment and contribution. He in fact arranges them as an equation.
Talent = Competence X Commitment X Contribution
The multiplication sign in the above equation symbolizes the collaborative and combine nature of the three vital aspects. Competence essentially refers to the knowledge (head), commitment refers to action (hands) and contribution is related to values (heart).
Reinventing...
What we do with talent occupy a significant segment of our definition. Acquisition refers to hiring (recruitment, selection and placement). Engagement means a range of aspects such as involvement, attachment and extra effort.
There is a reference to the term, relevant tools in our definition. What we meant was to incorporate testing methods, assessment techniques etc. which should be linked to the organizational requirements.
We consciously included the term Conducive Climate in our HRM definition. This means a supportive environment within organization. HR has a critical role to play in creating such a climate. Climate refers to those aspects of the environment that are consciously perceived by organizational members. Perception is essentially an understanding based on the information obtained by senses such as eyes and ears. Hence, climate is something people see, hear and feel. That is why we see a difference when we enter a hospital, police station or a restaurant. In summary, climate is what we see and feel when we enter an organization, whereas, culture is something much deeper as bedrock.
The end result of all HR endavours, the way we see, is having twin aspects, Organizational Excellence and Societal Well-being. What we mean by organizational excellence is its overall performance with continuous improvement. It, obviously, include financial results, customer satisfaction, process efficiency and people development, the four perspectives of a typical balanced scorecard.
HR professionals cannot function in isolation ignoring the social realities. This is more relevant to a developing country like ours, where issues such as poverty, unemployment and ethnic tensions cannot be ignored. That’s why we included Societal Well-being as a key outcome of HRM. It highlights the need to support people outside the organization and protecting the environment as well.
Defining HRM clearly was one step towards delivering sustained results. Now we need to put the acts together, in ensuring the awareness, appreciation and application among Sri Lankan HR Professionals. “Great vision without great people is irrelevant”, so said Jim Collins of “Good to Great” fame.
HR professionals
Human Resource has always been an evolving function. It not only focuses on the most precious resource in any organization but also engage in actions to ensure the presence of competencies for competitive advantage. As much as it had in the past, and having in the present, the function of HR will have many challenges in the future. It reminds me of seven Gs of HRM in relation to talent, the framework I used in my textbook, “HRM for Managers: A Learning Guide”. They refer to goal, get, give, grow, glue, glow and guard, each representing a specific function of HR.
The world of HR is full of jargons. My attempt is not to complicate it by adding more terms. As Shakespeare vividly wrote in Romeo and Juliet, “What's in a name? That which we call a rose, by any other name would smell as sweet." Whether we call critical competencies or core capabilities or by any other name, the reality is the need to deliver promptly. That is where HR professionals have to act as “thinking performers”, in taking the profession forward.
There had been numerous discussions on why HR professionals are “at the tap” and not “at the top”. Prof. Dave Ulrich and his team of researchers have been working on an evolving model on the cutting-edge competencies required by the HR professionals. They started identifying the need to play the roles of strategic partner, employee champion, administrative expert and change agent. The seventh revision that came last year which was termed as HR Competency Model of 2016 is revolving around “paradox navigation”.
The typical dictionary meaning of paradox is that it is “a seemingly absurd or contradictory statement or proposition which when investigated may prove to be well founded or true.” Navigation on the other hand means “the process or activity of accurately ascertaining one's position and planning and following a route”. This is the acute need in front of HR professionals.
As Prof. Ulrich explains, “navigating paradox means accepting, exploring, and dealing with the inevitable tensions in a business. They have to help the business to be both short and long term, top/down and bottom/up, global and local, divergent and convergent, strategic and operational, etc. By navigating these paradoxes, organizations are more able to respond to the demands of change in today’s business context.”
In essence, “paradox navigation” is the ability to steer amidst the many embedded tensions in complex organizational operations. We can raise a few vital questions here. Does the HR professional effectively manage the tensions between high-level strategic issues and operational details? Does he/she effectively manage the tensions between internal focus on employees and external focus on customers and investors? Does he/she effectively manage the tension between taking time to gather information and making timely decisions? Does he/she effectively manage the tensions between global and local business demands? Does he/she effectively manage the tensions between the need for change (flexibility, adaptability) and stability (standardization)?
The reality is that the HR professionals are constantly wrestling with embedded tensions that must be resolved in some circumstances and cultivated in other circumstances in order to help the business move forward. Wisely navigating through these surrounded strains becomes one of the central challenges for modern HR professionals.
What could be some of these key challenges? I would call them the challenge to be lean, seen and green. Let’s explore them further.
There is a wave of becoming faster, cheaper and better in an increasingly competitive global scene. HR cannot avoid its influence. Stemming from the Japanese concept of creating value by eliminating waste, lean management has spread its wings to cover both manufacturing and service sectors.
Gone are the days that HR was “humanly rich” as a department with all sorts of people, mostly dumped by the seniors. Efficiency with regard to optimizing cadre, in clearly identifying the needs and the specific roles associated is of utmost importance. One key thing to remember is that HR has to work hand in hand with other functional departments in being lean. There is no room for silo mentality.
Be Seen is the second challenge. There are a variety of virtual teams that are technologically connected but geographically separated. A global virtual team might have members based in New York, New Delhi and New South Wales. Telecommuting is an arrangement where a person can work from home by connecting through technology without physically coming to work. What could be the possible HR challenges? Let’s discuss.
Major challenges
Based on my research with two US-based colleagues, it was evident that one major challenge in a virtual team arrangement is to trust each other. If you have worked with someone physically in the same office at least for some time, they found it easier to work as a virtual team. The challenge was to interact with relatively unfamiliar members of the team in a distant location.
It is an interesting HR scenario in this context. Each member of the virtual team based in a different location has to be governed by their local labour laws and other local HR practices. At the same time, there is a global HR strategy. Hence, it is a case of thinking globally and acting locally with regard to HR practices pertaining to virtual team arrangements.
Why the “seen” factor is so important to HR? The answer lies in the nature of virtual teams and telecommuting workforce. They are the new net-centric nomads. Nomads, in the sense that their work desk can be a seat in an airplane with laptop or palmtop connected to the internet. For them, what matters is the connectivity more than the location. Their daily HR functions are carried by a supervisor, also in a remote location. Some of the virtual team members have not seen the central HR colleagues, after their initial hiring discussion. On one hand, it is good to delegate and to make every manager a people manager. However, on the other hand, the vibrant presence of the HR as a guiding and facilitating function is also essential.
Such a scenario leads to a visibility issue. How can HR show its availability for coaching, training, performance advice and other matters? Is it practically possible to meet all employees scattered all over? What should be the best cost-effective arrangement? These are some of the questions that HR professionals have to find answers.
Let’s move to the third challenge, which is to be green. We are living in world where nature has begun to strike back. Chaotic weather patterns across the globe are a grim reminder that eco-friendly practices of work need a lot more attention. What matters is not only profit but people and planet as well. Obviously, it impacts HR in collectively ensuring the triple bottom line.
Some common green human resource initiatives in the west include, using Web or teleconferencing to reduce travel, promoting the reduction of paper use and implementing wellness programmes to foster employees’ proper nutrition, fitness, and healthy living.
The important point here is the need to integrate green initiatives with lean and seen initiatives. In other words, they are not three isolated sets of actions but one holistic path. Take paper reduction for an example. Instead of having piles of personnel files in a store room, a well-designed HR information system (HRIS) will do the needful in a much more effective manner. It is a case of being lean and green at the same time.
By being green, HR has to foster SHE. SHE stands for safety, health and environment. A healthy workforce who perform their duties with safety in mind, without polluting the environment is the growing need of our workplaces.
In essence, HR professionals have to be paradox navigators by being diligent in a digital workplace. As Prof. Ulrich’s team has coined, the paradox navigation encompasses eight other key roles an HR professional has to play. He/ she has to be a strategic positioner, a credible activist, a culture and change champion, a human capital curator, a total rewards steward, a technology and media integrator, an analytics designer & interpreter and a compliance manager. It is very clear that when HR professionals play such comprehensive roles committedly, they contribute immensely to their respective organizations. That is when HRM as a profession experiences a rewarding renewal.
In digging deeper, I see a parallel between paradox navigation by western HR researchers and the Yin-Yang concept of eastern wisdom. In simple terms, yin is characterized as slow, soft, yielding, diffuse, cold, wet, and passive; and is associated with water, earth, the moon, femininity and night-time. Yang, by contrast, is fast, hard, solid, focused, hot, dry, and aggressive; and is associated with fire, sky, the sun, masculinity and daytime.
To put even more precisely, yin yang are complementary opposites that interact within a greater whole, as part of a dynamic system. Everything has both yin and yang aspects, but either of these aspects may manifest more strongly in particular objects, and may ebb or flow over time. This is the nature of HRM in reality, where managing employee concerns as well as employer concerns need to take place with synergy and harmony.
In other words, showcasing paradox navigation is one way of accepting the eastern duality. This is very much pertinent in the context of change where we are increasingly moving into a Volatile, Uncertain, Chaotic and Ambiguous (VUCA) World.
Paradox navigation can in fact move beyond HR. In practical sense, every manager has to do so in some way or the other. In other words, it is challenge of balancing the harmony between yin and yang.
Leader, manager and administrator
I recall Prof. Sudatta Ranasinghe delivering a thought-provoking speech on indigenous management at a research conference organized by the University of Sri Jayewardenepura. The more we identify ways of harmonize management concepts with indigenous aspects of a culture, better will be its impact. HR professionals in becoming paradox navigators have to fulfill this need.
Thomas J. Watson Junior, the founder of IBM, in his book, “A Business and its Beliefs” says: "I believe the real difference between success and failure in a corporation can be very often traced to the question of how well the organization brings out the great energies and talents of its people." This is relevant to Sri Lankan organizations and their managers as well. As every manager has a people management role to play, they have to work hand in hand with their HR colleagues. It reminds me what our ancient Subhashitha poet said.
Famous people with wisdom will not get unhappy even when they are much tired. Fragrant Sandalwood will still emanate its fragrance, even if it is crushed or squeezed.
Obviously, this has been very true for Prof. Sudatta Ranasinghe. I am sure this should be true for any HR professional. Also, it is for any leader, manager and administrator.
Life is not only to live but to leave a legacy. Prof. Ranasinghe has aptly done that in his knowledge creating and knowledge sharing life. “In order to succeed, people need a sense of self-efficacy, to struggle together with resilience to meet the inevitable obstacles and inequities of life”, so said Albert Bandura, the most admired living psychologist of our times. This was evident in the way Prof. Sudatta conducted himself in difficult times.
He had a purpose to live and it was indeed a purpose driven life. His thoughts will spark our minds for a long time. I am proud to be one of his “learning partners”, a term we prefer to use at the PIM signifying the valued intellectual interaction.
As I firmly believe, the best tribute we can pay for late Prof. Ranasinghe is to have a serving mindset towards deserving humanity. One sure fire way of doing that is to become a paradox navigator in facing the reality and moving ahead with confidence and competence. It will be pertinent to ponder on a serene Sanskrit Shloka that I came across.
Asato Maa Sad-GamayaTamaso Maa Jyotir-GamayaMrtyor-Maa Amrtam Gamaya
Lead us from Unreality to the RealityLead us from the Darkness to the LightLead us from the Fear of Death to the Knowledge of Immortality.
My humble invitation to all you in concluding my first ever memorial oration, is to reflect, refresh and relate in the relished realms of management. As a continuous learner in management, l would express from the bottom of my heart: Good bye my beloved teacher, Prof. Sudatta Wishwamithra Ranasinghe.
Thank you very much for your pleasant and patient participation.
