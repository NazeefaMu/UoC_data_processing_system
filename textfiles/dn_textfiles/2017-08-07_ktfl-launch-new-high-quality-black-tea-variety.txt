KTFL to launch new high-quality black tea variety

KTFL Chairman Pushpika Samarakoon said his company had decided to introduce BP 1 to the local market after Plantation Industries Minister Navin Dissanayake had instructed to introduce quality tea at an affordable price to the local market. He said CTC BP 1 was earlier produced mainly for exports, but added that this will be released at a very affordable price to the local market, heeding the instructions of the minister. He also said the CTC BP 1 will be a deviation from the dust tea varieties which are prevalent in the local market.
Samarakoon added that the BP 1 will be issued at a concessionary price to welfare shops managed by government and semi-government institutions as well. The CTC BP 1 variety Samarakoon said will be of good taste and flavor and people could make more tea cups out of the variety than the normal ones prevailing in the market. He also noted that KTFL tea was being produced with minimal agro-chemicals to ensure that products are healthy and toxin-free. Speaking about the progress of the KTFL, he said that all four factories under the company were earning profits. He said around 5,000 smallholders were currently providing tea leaves to the company. The Smallholders and their families, according to Samarakoon, are provided with many benefits, including insurance coverage’s, educational scholarships for children, concessionary loans etc.
According to Samarakoon, the company currently produces over 2,000,000 kgs of black tea annually and its products have a high demand in both foreign and local markets. KTFL contributes to 6.89 per cent of national CTC tea production and 30.23 percent of total low-grown CTC tea production to national output. It’s output has been recognized and rewarded as the best quality low-grown CTC tea on several occasions. Kalubowitiyana Tea Factory Ltd (KTFL) was incorporated under the Companies Act on September 30, 1992 as a public company fully owned by the Government.
It began commercial operations at the then newly built CTC Tea Factory at Kalubowitiyana on August 1, 1994. This CTC Tea Factory was built with the assistance of the Indian Line of Credit.
The Company has been operating on a self-financing basis since 1995.
