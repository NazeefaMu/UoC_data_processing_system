Rahuman urges action to curb extremism

Attack on Rohingya refugees:
UNP Colombo District MP Mujibur Rahuman yesterday urged the government to take action to curb extremist groups in the country.
He explained that the extremist group which attacked Rohingya refugees on September 26 had been involved in similar racist attacks for the last 2-3 years with little action taken against them.
“These people were acting like thugs in front of the Police and were allowed to get away with it. Among this group was one person who was previously arrested and out on bail. He has clearly violated bail conditions and yet not arrested,” said Rahuman.
The Colombo District MP said such inaction by the government made those within and outside of government question whether the regime was party to such acts.
Those who voted for the current government hoped that they would put a stop to these racist attacks but I am disappointed that it has continued, he said.
“The President and Prime Minister travel the world trying to win the faith of the international community but these acts will just damper their efforts,” said Rahuman.
He further asked that the government call for a report from the intelligence services and find out who is responsible for these groups and who is funding them.
“We cannot have reconciliation and development with such groups. The end result if this continues will only be a change in regime.
Even we, who are with the government, have a problem with how things are going,” said the UNP MP.
“There is no point just having two thirds majority in Parliament. We need to have law and order ensured in the country,” he added.
