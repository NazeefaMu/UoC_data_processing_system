Navy rescues two from  drowning at Gregory Lake

Naval personnel attached to the Navy’s Rapid Response Rescue and Relief Unit rescued two persons from drowning in the Gregory Lake in Nuwara Eliya yesterday.
The rescued were residents of Uhana, Ampara. They had fallen off the high-speed Jet Ski they were riding, being unable to control its speed.
The 4RU boat on patrol rushed to the location and brought the two persons safely ashore, the Navy media unit said.
