The Colombo Chief Magistrate yesterday permitted Bribery Commission to amend charge sheets pertaining to five corruption cases filed against former Minister Johnston Fernando and two others.
This is for allegedly causing a Rs.40 million unlawful loss to the government by employing 153 employees of the Cooperative Wholesale Establishment (CWE) for election work during the period 2010 to 2014.
Accordingly, cases against former Cooperative and Internal Trade Minister Johnston Fernando, former CWE (Lak Sathosa) Chairman Eraj Fernando and former Minister’s Private Secretary Raj Mohideen Mohammad Sakeer were fixed for July 14 by Chief Magistrate Lal Ranasinghe Bandara.
The Director General of the Commission to Investigate Allegations of Bribery or Corruption filed these corruption cases against three accused under Section 70 of the Bribery Act on three charges.
The Bribery Commission alleged that the first accused Johnston Fernando had unlawfully employed 153 employees for election work during the period 2010 to 2014, while he was serving as Cooperatives and Internal Trade Minister.
