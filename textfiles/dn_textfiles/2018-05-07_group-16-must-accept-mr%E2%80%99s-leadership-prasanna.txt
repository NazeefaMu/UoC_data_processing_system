Group of 16 must accept MR’s leadership: Prasanna

The group of 16, who resigned from the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP), must accept Mahinda Rajapaksa’s leadership or they will end up being another group that safeguards the government from opposition ranks like the JVP and the TNA do, Gampaha District Parliamentarian Prasanna Ranatunga said.
He was addressing a meeting at Galle on May 5.
Ranatunga said the 16 member group should work with the ‘Pohottuwa Party’ under the leadership of Mahinda if they really had a backbone.
Ranatunga said they were opposed the 16 member group joining their ranks.
“Everyone in the JO including Ramesh and Mohan opposed them,” he said.
“There is a group supporting Mahinda Rajapaksa with dedication from the day he faced defeat at the elections,” Prasanna said.
“You all need not get upset even if the 16 member group joined us, because you are the people who had the right to vote at an election. I ask you to ensure the defeat of the 16 member group by voting against them even if Mahinda Rajapaksa canvassed supporting to them.
You ought to remind Mahinda Rajapaksa that they were the people who betrayed him last time being his bosom friends.
Ranatunga said that even though Mahinda Rjapaksa advised him not to attack the 16 members as his intention was to spoil the government’s two third majority, he agreed to it on the spur of the moment, but the very next moment he criticised and attacked them because that was his nature.
Ranatunga said that as the JVP was bringing in the 20th amendment to the constitution to suppress the other burning problems in the country and make people forget them. “Today no one was talking about the Central Bank Bond issue,” he said.
Recently, certain top officials attached to the President were caught in the bribery net.
He said the Pohottuwa decided Galle should be its venue for the May Day Rally since the government refused to give them the Galle Face Green.
“The government had changed Vesak Poya and May Day. This could have been the real change it had promised,” Ranatunga said.
