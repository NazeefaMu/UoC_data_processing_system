Navy initiates projects to preserve eco-system

The Navy carried out several projects of planting mangrove saplings in the lagoon areas of the Northern and Northwestern Naval Commands recently to mark the International Day for the Conservation of the Mangrove Ecosystem.
Accordingly, over 1,000 mangrove saplings were planted in the lagoon areas in the Northern Naval Command under the guidance of the Commander Northern Naval Area, Rear Admiral Merril Wickramasinghe. Officers and sailors attached to the Northern Naval Command participated.
Saplings were planted in the Modara Gam Aruwa region belonging to SLNS Barana in the Northwestern Naval Area as well.
The drive was joined by the Commander Northwestern Naval Area, Rear Admiral Sujeewa Perera, Naval personnel of SLNS Barana, students and teachers of Mullikulam Roman Catholic School, fisher folk in the area and several foreigners. Similar programmes were carried out in the naval establishments of Rapid Action Boat Squadron Headquarters, SLNS Thambapanni, SLNS Therapuththa and SLNS Vijaya as well. Over 2,170 mangrove saplings were planted in the North Western Naval Area. A key partner in conservation of land and marine environments, the Navy has thus far planted over 100,000 mangrove plants to promote mangrove ecosystems.
