Prosperous Capital and Credit wins Green Leadership award

Prosperous Capital and Credit Limited (PCCL) has won global accolade and has being nominated for a Green Leadership award at the Asia Responsible Entrepreneurship Awards (AREA).
The awards ceremony organized by Aruna Liyanage, Senior Programme Manager, Prosperous Capital and Assurance Ltd, said that PCCL was set up just three years ago and receiving an international award speaks volumes about their success.
The project (Green Word) for which the award was won included the promotion of Green Agricultural practices.

Some of the key objectives of this award-winning project included giving support to achieve United Nations sustainable development goals, reduction of environment pollution, supporting domestic financial management, creating savings habits among people, increasing family health conditions and helping to increase their revenue and promoting organic farming.
PCCL Managing Director Madhawa Edussuriya said they are currently incorporated as a private limited company and has applied for the micro finance licence along with several other players from the Central Bank.
Edussuriya said the company which is run by a Board of veterans in the industry with over 20 years of local and foreign experience opened their first branch in Sooriyawewa, in August 2014.
“This venture can be regarded as one among the firsts in the finance industry involving a region where micro finance had not yet penetrated.” He said that they hope to open more branches in the North and East this year as they see a great demand for this model from these areas.
The awards ceremony would be held on June 1 in Thailand and is being organized by Malaysian-based Enterprise Asia, a non-governmental organization in pursuit of creating an Asia that is rich in entrepreneurship as an engine towards sustainable and progressive economic and social development within a world of economic equality.
