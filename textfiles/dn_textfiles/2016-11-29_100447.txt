How Natalie Portman became Jackie O

It’s not easy being Jackie.
Until her deat h in 1994, former first lady Jacqueline Bouvier Kennedy Onassis was one of the most famous, photographed women in the world. Every outfit was obsessed over; every facial expression - indeed, each word she said - analyzed. This was never more true than during the time period following her husband John F. Kennedy’s assassination in Dallas on Nov. 22, 1963, when she impressed the world with her graceful stoicism. The new biopic “Jackie,” by Chilean filmmaker Pablo Larrain, stars Natalie Portman in the lead role.
The film focuses on the week after the assassination, alternating between the day itself, the state funeral, occasional flashbacks and the interview Kennedy gave to Life magazine in Hyannis Port, Mass., one week after the assassination.“Don’t let it be forgot, that once there was a spot, for one brief shining moment that was known as Camelot,” she said in that interview, consciously planting the seeds for a presidential myth.
“There will be great presidents again. But there will never be another Camelot.”
So how to become Jackie, a role that has been played over the decades by dozens of actresses, from Katie Holmes to Jaclyn Smith, Ginnifer Goodwin to Roma Downey?
For one, there’s the voice: Kennedy had a distinctly patrician, unusual accent. “She has that breathy, almost girlish sound, but with an affected air of calm,” said dialect coach Tanya Blumstein, who worked with Portman.
“A lot of the girls went to Miss Porter’s [the Connecticut boarding school Jackie attended], and they were forcibly lady-fied. Jackie’s accent is mid-Atlantic but peppered with L ong Island.”
