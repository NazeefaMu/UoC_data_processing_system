ProMate exercise books  creates sales record

ProMate, a leading Sri Lankan brand of exercise books, manufactured in compliance with international standards, established a new sales record during the last school term, Nalinda Jayamanne, Chief Operation Officer, Printxcel Pvt. Ltd., said.
Inspired by the rich inheritance of 60 years in the domain of publications and printing of government school text books it carries from its parent company, ProMate is all set to take the exercise books landscape to the next level.
Expressing his views on the new sales record achieved by ProMate exercise books, Nalinda Jayamanne, Chief Operation Officer, Printxcel Pvt. Ltd., said “With the introduction of ProMate exercise books to the market, the products became exceedingly popular amongst school children within a short period of time. The primary reason the ProMate brand became so well received and widely favored was its superlative quality and refined finish, which are both attractive and appealing. It was because of these distinctive features that we were able to set a new sales record during the last school term.”
ProMate exercise books are manufactured using an exclusively picked paper of 70GSM imported from Indonesia. These books are produced in compliance with global standards, taking in to account the health and safety aspects of school-going children, Nalinda Jayamanne stressed.
The production process of these books have been awarded ISO 9001-2008 international certification.
Apart from its ProMate books, Printxcel has also introduced to the market a range of superior quality stationery products under the 'Mango' brand for the use of school, home and office.
The relaunch of “Rathna Exercise Books”, the well-known brand produced by the prestigious Rathna Publishers, under a new look with the depiction of famous and popular cartoon characters it tipped to be significantly popular amongst children is also in the offing.
