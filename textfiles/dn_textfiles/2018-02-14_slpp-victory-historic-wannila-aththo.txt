SLPP victory historic: Wannila Aththo

The victory recorded by the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna is a historic turn in Sri Lankan politics, the Chief of Adivasi people Uruwarige Wannila Aththo said yesterday.
Wannila Aththo said: “A new party recorded the victory at the Local Government polls this time.
They defeated the oldest two political parties in the country. Thus, this victory is historic,” he said.
“I believe this will go down in Sri Lankan political history as a party with a very short history defeating the largest two political parties in the country.
I am personally baffled by this victory,” he added.
