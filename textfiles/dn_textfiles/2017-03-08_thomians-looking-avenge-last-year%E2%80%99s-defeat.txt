Thomians looking to avenge last year’s defeat

After an initial spell of uncertainity the Thomians are firmly believing in themselves and are in a positive frame of mind that they can avenge last year’s defeat at the hands of Royal College this time around at the 138th Battle of the Blues encounter which begins on March 9 and goes on for three days at the SSC grounds Maitland Place.
According to Thomian coach Dinesh Kumarasinghe, the present outfit is the youngest Thomian team playing in a Royal-Thomian match since 1983 with just three coloursmen sans much fanfare.
The team has reached good heights by winning five of their 18 matches and remained unbeaten.
They have recorded outright wins against Dharmapala, Dharmasoka Ambalangoda, Anuradhapura Central, St. Sylvester’s and Trinity College, Kandy.
The last win against Trinity College after 29 years has really boosted the confidence of the side and has made them feel second to none.
Although there are only two centurions in the side namely Dinura Gunawardene and Ishen Perera, skipper Romesh Nallaperuma (over 650 runs), opener Ravindu Kodituwakku (over 800runs) and Mithila Perera (over 650 runs), Sithara Hapuhinna and Delon Peiris have proved that they are consistent scorers.
However, the Thomian’s forte has been their bowling. Their spin attack comprising the left- arm leg-spin of Pavith Ratnayake who has already taken 95 wickets for the season with a best analysis (7 for 47) against Dharmapala Pannipitiya and looking forward to complete the century mark of wickets during the three day contest.
Supported by Delon Peiris with the capable Kalana Perera, Dinura Gunawardene and Ravindu Kodituwakku in addition to his batting could also chip in as an useful bowler. The Thomians are fortunate enough to get the expertise of Sri Lanka’s World Cup winning coach Dav Whatmore as a consultant coach. Whatmore along with Dinesh Kumarasinghe, the head coach has given the team more confidence.
Kumarasinghe is aware of the capabilities of the experienced Royalists and prefers to be und erdogs. At the same time he is supremely confident and knows the strength of his side and along with Whatmore would have drawn a strategic plan how to combat the opponents.
Duleep Mendis struck 184 in 1972 and it stands as the highest individual score for the Thomians in the contest.
Royal’s Sumithra Warnakulasuriya’s194 in 1980 is the highest individual score by any player in the series. The Thomians last won in 2007 under Ashen Peiris when the Royal captain was Haroon Mowjood.
