Over 2,500 local and overseas jobs at EDEX fair on September 2-3

Over 18 prestigious Sri Lankan private sector companies will expect to provide nearly 2,500 local and overseas employment opportunities to participants at the EDEX Mid- Year Expo 2017 two-day exhibition which will be held on September 02 (tomorrow) and September 03, at the Sri Lanka Exhibition and Convention Centre (opposite Lake House).
The exhibition which will open to the public from 10.00 am to 6.30 pm on both days will be declared open by Minister of Law and Order Sagala Ratnayaka, while the job fair will be opened by International Labour Organization (ILO) Country Director Simrin Singh.
Speaking to Daily News Business, EDEX Chairman Mahinda Galagedera said over 20,000 visitors including students from public, private and international schools and from universities are expected at the two-day exhibition.
He said the education exhibition will be represented by over 100 local and foreign universities in 20 countries, including USA, UK and Australia.
He said this exhibition will highlight the importance of receiving higher education by school children, school leavers and university students. Galadegera further said three exhibitions are held in Colombo and Kandy every year and the objective of holding these exhibitions is to create awareness among Sri Lankan youth about existing local and international educational courses and thereafter how to find employment.
He said the EDEX Expo also encouraged local youth to be entrepreneurs who could create employment for job seekers.
“The forthcoming Mid-Year Expo will live up to its reputation to be a comprehensive platform offering choices, options in realizing opportunities in school-to-work transition, entrepreneurship and sustainability.”
Chairman Galagedera further said the exhibition will help participants to select academic, vocational, technical and professional courses and post graduate programmes which will be offered by both local and foreign educational institutions.
It is said that all educational institutions which tie up with the EDEX organizing committee have agreed to offer discounted course fees, full or partial scholarships and many other offers with financial support options for the benefit of students.
He also said the job fair will be a catalyst for youth to market their inherent talent, skills and qualifications to impress employers.
He said during the exhibition period interactive seminars in accountancy, finance, HR and management will be conducted for the benefit of students
“Like in the previous year, we have been facilitating the administering of psychometric testing for all participants at the specially designed EDEX Career Pavilion,” he added.
The print media sponsors of the exhibition are Daily News and Sunday Observer.
