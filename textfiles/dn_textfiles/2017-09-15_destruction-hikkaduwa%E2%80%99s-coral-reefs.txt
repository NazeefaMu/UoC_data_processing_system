The destruction                         of Hikkaduwa’s coral reefs

Sri Lanka’s coral reefs have long been attracting tourists from around the world. According to research stemming back to the 1980s, about two percent of the country’s coastline contains nearshore fringing reefs. Peppering the sea-beds of the Indian Ocean, these coral reefs are home to a host of marine life making them both aesthetically pleasing and environmentally consequential.
The coral reefs were bleached in 1998, with the other impacts in the Indian Ocean, due to the El Niño effect
In and around the waters of Hikkaduwa, specifically, these coral reefs are part of the Hikkaduwa Marine Sanctuary, the first such designated sanctuary in Sri Lanka. And they’ve gained a reputation among visitors who come from near and far to see them up close. All along Galle Road in the area, there are diving shops and individual instructors offering the opportunity to snorkel or scuba dive, among them.
But, there is trouble in paradise.
Trouble in Paradise
“Most of the coral here have waved goodbye,” said Kalu Priyantha, the founder of Blue Deep Diving Centre in Hikkaduwa, who has been working in the diving business here since 1995. By goodbye, he means the coral has died or been bleached.
“Everyone asks about corals this, corals that. People come to see their bright colours and all the fish swimming around them. And when I tell them many are dead, then they don’t even want to snorkel. It’s hurting our business because the tourists expect living corals.”
Unbeknownst to many, coral reefs are not abiotic structures but clusters of thousands of tiny sea animals called polyps. They’re alive, always growing and changing and evolving. In doing so, they become hotbeds of biodiversity, providing a home for at least 25 percent of all marine species, even though they occupy less than 0.1 percent of the world’s ocean surface. But coral reefs, just like any living being, are susceptible to death if they aren’t properly cared for or if they are constantly under threat. And in the Hikkaduwa Marine Sanctuary, that is exactly what’s happening.
Degradation of reefs
According to Dr. Arjan Rajasuriya, the International Union for Conservation of Nature’s (IUCN) Marine and Coastal Thematic Area Coordinator in Sri Lanka and one of the two leading proponents of the creation of the Hikkaduwa Marine Sanctuary in 1985, there are a host of factors responsible for the degradation of the reefs.
“The coral reefs were bleached in 1998, with the other impacts in the Indian Ocean, due to the El Niño effect,” explained Rajasuriya. During that time, a climatic phenomenon known as El Niño generated a warm ocean current that increased the temperature of the sea in Hikkaduwa by 5 degrees Celsius, which in turn reduced the number of live coral cover from 47 percent to just 13 percent.
Healthy coral reef
This is where climate change and global warming come in, for the El Niño effect is but one of its many consequences. Healthy corals play host to microscopic algae that live in their tissues, act as their primary food source, and give them their coral. But when the coral becomes stressed due to pollution, or, as is the case with El Niño, and increased oceanic temperature, the algae flees the coral tissue. Without the algae, the coral loses its major source of food, turns white or very pale, and becomes more susceptible to disease. This is what is meant by coral bleaching.

Often, coral reefs can recover, if not entirely, from episodes of bleaching. “Some species are fairly tolerant of partial bleaching,” said Rajasuriya. But when asked about the current status of Hikkaduwa’s reefs, almost 20 years after El Niño caused mass coral bleaching in the Indian Ocean, Rajasuriya responded with little optimism.
“Very poor, because there are other negative impacts that are there, particularly filling the area with sand, which is something that is happening naturally,” he said.
Rajasuriya explained that there was an improvement to Hikkaduwa’s fishery harbour after the Boxing Day Tsunami in 2004, an extension added to the Southern breakwater of the harbour. Unintentionally, this accelerated the filling of sand inside the sanctuary, leading the area to become extremely shallow and sand deposition within it to be quite high.
“As a result, recovery is very slow and only certain species are able to tolerate that kind of sedimentation or sand accumulation. Those are the ones that are there now. Most of the corals, particularly the branching corals, have never recovered fully after the ‘98 bleaching event.”
Human activity can harm or help
Further human activity could be working to improve the conditions that would best allow for the reefs to recover. Instead, we’re making it worse.
“People are still walking on the reefs, climbing onto the corals, and so on. The glass bottom boats are still operating over the corals and tend to bump into the corals. These boats are using engines with fuel containing kerosene, and as a result there is the exhaust fume of kerosene, which doesn’t burn completely and mixes with the sea water.”
Much of the degradation of the coral reefs has already happened or is no longer preventable. According to Rajasuriya, there is no longer a way to stop the coral bleaching.
“That is no longer within the control of humans. It will go on, because climate change is happening. We have set that in motion and can’t put a brake on it in a hurry.”
However, he maintains some optimism.
“There are some species that are fairly tolerant of the level of bleaching that is happening now. So they get partially bleached and then they recover. And then maybe after another two years they get another partial bleaching and then again they recover a little bit. Like that it goes on. Many of the corals in Hikkaduwa go through this process now. They can adapt to some extent, as long as the effects of climate change don’t accelerate rapidly, and the sand accumulation does not accelerate. There will be some recovery taking place.”
The key, he insists, is to ensure that whatever corals are undergoing recovery completely avoid exploitative human activity. Since the Hikkaduwa Marine Sanctuary was formed under the Flora and Fauna Protection Ordinance, which falls under the Department of Wildlife Conservation, Rajasuriya says the department has a big role to play in this regard. He says the department has taken a positive step by attempting to regulate the glass-bottom boats by requiring the trips to be ticketed. Still, he says, there is more that can be done.
“The Department of Wildlife Conservation needs to be more proactive and prevent people from walking on the reef. They should advise people who are about to go snorkelling, and advise the various diving stations how they should inform their customers about what to do inside the sanctuary. And generally, they should patrol the area. They have a responsibility to look after whatever is remaining there.”
If human activity is channelled toward aiding rather than abusing the coral reefs in Hikkaduwa’s Marine Sanctuary, they will have a chance at recovery. Still, restoration to what the reefs once were, before the bleaching incident in 1998 and the subsequent threats to their survival, is unlikely.
“It is not a total write-off,” Rajasuriya said. “But, you can’t expect it to have the same conditions, the same amount of coral, the same beauty, as it once had.”
