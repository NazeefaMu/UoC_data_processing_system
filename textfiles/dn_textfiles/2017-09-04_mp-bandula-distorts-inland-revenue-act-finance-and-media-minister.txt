MP Bandula distorts Inland Revenue Act: Finance and Media Minister

Finance and Media Minister Mangala Samaraweera said MP Bandula Gunawardena was making distorted statements on the Inland Revenue Act following Kurunegala District MP Mahinda Rajapaksa, who is conspiring to disrupt the current regime.
"MP Bandula Gunawardena had stated recently that the new Inland Revenue Acts was in favour of foreigners. He seems to have conveniently forgotten the various tax holidays and exemptions given by the ministers of the previous regimes to their cronies and nepotists making use of the provisions of the Strategic Development Act," Minister Samaraweera said.
"The actions of the previous regime in granting long term tax concessions and tax holidays in an undue and unjustifiable manner to their henchmen and to selected foreign nationals upon lucrative commissions have resulted in the distortion in economic benefits in the country. This situation has led to 10 percent of the population to enjoy 54 percent of the economic benefits,: the minister said.
"The Government has introduced a transparent policy of tax concessions through the new Inland Revenue Act where all parties including the so far neglected local investors can enjoy tax concessions upon their investments putting an end to the era of going behind politicians and their henchmen by bribing them for such concessions," Minister Samaraweera said.
"Since the Act clearly defines tax concessions available to investors, they can recognise beforehand the tax concessions they deserve," he said.
"Mahinda Rajapaksa and his group is against streamlining tax holidays due to fear that in future no politician would have the upper hand in deciding the issuing of tax holidays to investors because the Ministers of the previous regime made use of the Strategic investment Act to arrogate powers unto themselves and to make money for them," he said.
"With the introduction of this Act, the discretionary power vested in the Finance Minister to grant tax concessions will also be negated," he said.
The present Finance Minister would like assure the caretakers of religious institutions as well as the entire public that there’s no truth whatsoever in the canards propagated to mislead the public claiming the members of families with an annual income of Rs. six lakhs, senior citizens and religious institutions will be taxed by the new Act," Minister Samaraweera said.
He said the Government would launch eight new concessionary loan schemes in September for diverse beneficiaries including entrepreneurs, small and medium scale industrialists, farmers and journalists through state and private sector banks introducing tax concessions and tax holidays in comparison to their investments.
