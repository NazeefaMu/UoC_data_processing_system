Adivasis offer bees honey to Sacred Tooth Relic

Sri Lankan Aborigines (Adiwasis) offered bees honey to the Sacred Tooth Relic at the Sri Dalanda Maligawa in Kandy led by Veddah Chief Vishwa Keerthi Vanaspathy Uruwarige Vannila Aththo yesterday morning (21). This is an annual event of the Adiwasis in Sri Lanka. The Diyawadana Nilame welcomed the Adiwasis.
The Adiwasis traditionally offered honey to the Sacred Tooth Relic on the 1st day of its Randoli Perahera. Customary, they offer the best and the foremost part of honey collected from honeycombs in forests. The Veddah chieftain expects safety and prosperity of their clan by the custom.
He said usage of chemicals and pesticides has resulted in reducing quantity and quality of honey.
