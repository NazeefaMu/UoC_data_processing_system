Addalaichenai Weaving Centre road needing urgent repairs

Residents of Addalaichenai DS division are faced with great difficulties in reaching the Addalaichenai division No: 12, as the Weaving Centre concrete road is in a dilapidated condition due to disrepair.
School children attend the Addalaichenai Central College (National School), Al-Muneera Ladies High School and Iqrah Vidyalaya with much difficulty. They have to cross the road with shoes in their hands.
Although residents have brought this matter to the notice of authorities several times, no action has yet been taken to repair the concrete road. People in the area urge the authorities to provide a quick solution to this matter.
Picture shows the present condition of the road.
