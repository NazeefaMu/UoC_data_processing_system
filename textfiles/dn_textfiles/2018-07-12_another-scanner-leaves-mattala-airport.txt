Another scanner leaves Mattala Airport

The only scanner installed at the entry to the passenger terminal gate at the Mattala Airport was removed yesterday.
The scanner is to be taken to the Katunayake Airport (BIA).
When the Mattala Airport was opened, it had six scanners installed at various locations, while three of them had been removed from time to time in the recent past. The scanner removed yesterday was the fourth to be removed. Airport employees have expressed fears that the removal would pose a threat to the airport security.
