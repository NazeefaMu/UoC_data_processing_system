‘I should have freedom to take decisions within Wildlife Act’

Sustainable Development, Wildlife and Provincial Development Minister Field Marshal Sarath Fonseka yesterday stressed the importance of finding a permanent solution to the human-elephant conflict in order to save the lives of both parties.
“As the Minister, I have the responsibility to protect wildlife. But when it comes to the human-elephant conflict, I have to think beyond the limitations and protect the lives of people,” he said.
Speaking to the media after the launching of book Hasthiraja Wanshaya by Tharaka Umayanga Dilshan at the Mahaweli Centre, Minister Fonseka said that the support of the government, general public and environmentalists is essential to put an end to the human-elephant conflict.
Speaking about his decision to remove two elephants temporarily from the Sinharaja Forest Reserve, Minister Fonseka said that it was a decision taken by him for the betterment of these two elephants and the residents of the area that the elephants frequented.
He further said that not only the lives of the villagers, but also the lives of those invading elephants are at risk. If these villagers cannot bear the behaviour of these two elephants anymore, they will definitely try to kill them by using a trap gun or something else.
“Around nine deaths of elephants have been reported since I was appointed as the Wildlife Minister. Around 50 percent of those deaths were due to gunshot wounds,” he said.
People who live in Colombo cannot empathise with those who live in areas where the human-elephant conflicts prevail. They do not feel the suffering of poor farmers due to invading elephants. The elephants destroy farmers’ crops and damage their homes.
“As the Minister of Wildlife, I should have freedom to take decisions that I can take within the limitations of the Wildlife Act,” said the Minister. He further charged that electric fences are not the best way to safeguard people from invading elephants. If those elephants cannot find food and feel hungry, they will try to find food even by destroying these fences.
“Using elephants for cultural events cannot be stopped. But we cannot accept the inhuman way of treating some of these elephants. Nobody should harm these elephants or limit their freedom,” he added.
