DHL Ranked as World’s Best Workplaces of 2018

DHL Express, the world leader in logistics and express delivery, has been recognized as the sixth best place to work globally in a 2018 employer ranking from Great Place to Work® and FORTUNE. Every year, Great Place to Work®, a global people analytics and consulting firm, assesses the work experience of employees through their certification program.
In 2018, more than 7,000 organizations participated in the survey process, representing the voices of 12 million employees worldwide. From that pool of companies, the 25 World’s Best Workplaces have been selected.
The assessment criteria are built around the core criterion of Trust, analyzing the relationship of employees with management, other employees and to their jobs.
“At DHL Express, we build our business strategy around our motivated people”, said Ken Allen, CEO, DHL Express. “We believe that employee motivation directly results in customer satisfaction and loyalty which brings business success. Our more than 100,000 employees are the biggest asset we have. This is why it is amazing to see that our investment in our people shows a sustainable impact.”
“Our HR strategy is looking holistically across the entire employee journey”, said Regine Buettner, Executive Vice President HR, Global and Europe, DHL Express. “While establishing a customer-first mindset across the organization, we make sure that we meet the needs of our employees so they have their best day at work every day. ‘Respect & Results’ is the principle guiding our actions and decisions, it reflects that while we create a trustful work environment, we sustain a high-performance mentality. A culture of engagement and recognition happens by design, not by default. While HR has a strategic, enabling and consulting role, it requires our leaders to actively shape the culture and our employees to live it on a daily business.”
“Congratulations to the World’s Best workplaces. It is a big challenge to build a high-trust culture that is great for employees in many countries across the globe. These organizations have bold leaders who have risen to the challenge, they are the vanguard showing millions of organizations worldwide that is possible and desirable to create a great place to work for all,” said Great Place to Work’s CEO, Michael Bush.
In Asia Pacific, DHL Express was also ranked second on the list of Asia’s Best Multinational Workplaces 2018, by Great Place to Work®. This accolade was presented in recognition of the company’s commitment to providing strong, caring and innovative culture.
In Sri Lanka, DHL Express received accolades in five categories by Great Place to Work in 2018: Gold Award for the Best Multinational Corporation, Gold Award for Best Medium Sized Enterprise Category, Special Award for Best Organization in ‘Trust’, Special Award for Best Organization in ‘Employee Collaboration’ and second place recognition for Best Multinational Workplaces in Asia.
