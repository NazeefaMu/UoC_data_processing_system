PUBLIC CONFIDENCE IN THE JUDICIARY

“The strength of the judiciary lies in the command that it has over the hearts and minds of men”. In the view of Justice Kenny, part of the Courts’ authority rests upon public confidence in the judiciary. In a democracy, the enforcement of judicial decrees and orders ultimately depends upon public co-operation (Judicial Ethics 1985). The public confidence in the judiciary highly depends upon the independence of it associated with judicial ethics.
For instance, four thousand years ago, the Code of Hammurabi provided that a judge who altered a written judgment should pay twelve-fold the penalty ordered in the judgment and should be publicly expelled from the bench. The principle of the independence of the judiciary requires the judiciary to ensure that judicial proceedings are conducted fairly and that the rights of the parties are respected (Principle No. 6, UN Basic Principles 1985).
Does Judiciary come under constant public scrutiny?
Justice must not merely be done but it must also be seen to be done. A judge shall avoid impropriety and the appearance of impropriety (Canon 1, Code of Judicial Conduct, American Bar Association 1990). For instance, in the matter of ‘John Chiovero 1990’, it was held that, when a jurist is offered a gift by a litigant, he must be aware of the possible appearance of an impropriety. Judges should regulate their conduct both in and out of Court as to further increase the public confidence in them.
Every Judge must at all times be conscious that he is under the public gaze and there should be no act or omission by him which is unbecoming of the high office he occupies and the public esteem in which that office is held (Canon 16, Restatement of Values of Judicial Life 1997). There would be a destruction of the public confidence if the public is aware of any corruption or some other serious wrongdoing of the existing judges (Gibbs 1987). According to Sydney Smith, “Nations fall where judges are unjust”.
Justice is not a cloistered virtue
As held in ‘Ambard Vs. Governor for Trinidad and Tobago 1936’, “Justice is not a cloistered virtue; she must be allowed to suffer the scrutiny and respectful, though outspoken, comments of ordinary men; no wrong is committed by any member of the public who exercises the ordinary right of criticising, in good faith, in private or in public, the public act done in the seat of justice”. In a democratic society, a certain level of criticism of the judiciary is inevitable and is also desirable. No judge is above the law he is sworn to administer (In re Esworthy, N.Y. Commission 1990).
Proceedings of every Court are fully exposed to public and professional scrutiny and criticism (‘Russell Vs. Russell 1976’). There is no disagreement that public criticism of judges and their work is not permissible, but it is also desirable and necessary to ensure that judges would continue to retain public confidence in the judiciary by performing their functions in accordance with their constitutional duties and professional responsibilities.
The Article 19 of the UDHR 1948 says that “Everyone has the right to freedom of opinion and expression; this right includes freedom to hold opinions without interference and to seek, receive and impart information and ideas through any media and regardless of frontiers”. The Article 14 (1) (a) of the Sri Lankan Constitution says, “every citizen is entitled to the freedom of speech and expression including publication”.
However, exercise and operation of this right are subject to restrictions as may be prescribed by law in relation to contempt of Court and defamation (Article 15 (2)). Therefore, the criticisms against the judiciary should be fair; otherwise, it could amount to the offence of contempt of Court. For instance, if words of a politician obstruct or interfere with the course of justice or the due administration of justice by the Court that would constitute a contempt of Court.
Fair criticism in respect of Judiciary
Proceedings for contempt of Court must not be in a diminution of free speech. There would be no contempt if the questioned statement could not be said to be of a character calculated to interfere with the administration of justice or to undermine the public confidence (Mills Vs. Townsville City Council 2003). For instance, even Presidents like Abraham Lincoln, Franklin D Roosevelt and Thomas Jefferson have rebuked judges of their day (American Bar Association report on the independence of judiciary 1997).
In ‘Attorney-General Vs. Butler 1953’, it was held that Courts of Justice should be subject to the freedom of criticism which is a necessary accompaniment of the freedom of speech which is the right of all free men. In ‘Nationwide News Pty Ltd Vs. Wills 1992’, it was held that the judiciary should be open to criticism; if the defendant exercised his ordinary right to criticise judiciary in good faith, then there was no contempt.
Scandalising the Court by unfair criticism
The contempt of Court sometimes worded as scandalising the Court. Contempt could be committed by publishing material scandalising the Courts or judges by abusing them in scurrilous terms, alleging they are corrupt or lack integrity, or that they have bowed to outside influences in reaching their decisions. Unfair criticism of Court decisions could break down the respect for the judiciary, in the minds of people.
In Contempt of Court, there must be involved some “act done, or writing published calculated to bring a Court or a judge of the Court into contempt or to lower his authority or something calculated to obstruct or interfere with the due course of justice or the lawful process of the Courts”. For instance, in ‘Re S.A. Wickremasinghe 1954’, at a public meeting, the respondent criticised Judges in the Courts in the city of Galle. Court held that it is no less an offence of contempt of Court to scandalise the judiciary generally than to scandalise the Judge or Judges of a particular Court.
A well-regulated law of a civilised community cannot be sustained without sanctions being imposed for contempt of Court. It is important to maintain the respect and dignity of the Court and its officers because without such respect, public faith in the administration of justice would be undermined and the law itself would fall into disrepute. The court in ‘AG Vs. Times Newspapers Ltd 1973’, held that the contempt of Court consists of conduct calculated to prejudice the requirements of the due administration of justice or to undermine the public confidence in it.
Punishing for contempt of ‘facie curiae’ or ‘ex facie curiae’
Both contempt in the presence and absence of the Court are considered offences. According to Article 105 (3) of the Constitution of Sri Lanka, the Supreme Court and the Court of Appeal could punish for contempt of itself, whether committed in the Court itself or elsewhere, with imprisonment or fine or both as the Court may deem fit. The power of the Court of Appeal shall include the power to punish for contempt of any other Court, Tribunal or Institution, whether committed in the presence of such court or elsewhere.
Every High Court, District Court and Magistrates’ Court shall have jurisdiction to punish the offence of contempt of Court committed in the presence of the Court itself and all offences which are committed in the course of any act or proceeding in the said Courts respectively, and which are declared by any law for the time being in force to be punishable as contempt of court (SS.18 & 55 (1) of Judicature Act No.02 of 1978).
In ‘Fernando Vs. AG 2003’, it was held that where a person is guilty of gross misbehaviour in Court and disturbs the proceedings it constitutes “ex facie curiae” (contempt in the face of Court) for which he is liable to be summarily judged and punished, without a formal charge. In the matter of ‘John Ferguson 1874’, Court held that the Supreme Court of Ceylon has all the powers for punishing for contempt, wherever committed in this Island. The Court in ‘Regent International Hotels Vs. Cyril Gardiner 1980’, held that the Court of Appeal has all the powers under Article 105(3) of the Constitution of punishing for contempt whether committed in ‘facie curiae’ or ‘ex facie curiae’.
Taking to task of the judiciary by political and media elements
In certain situations, politicians and media are playing a role in irresponsibly fabricating stories to show that public confidence in the judiciary has eroded by highlighting certain lapses of the judiciary out of proportion to their importance. For instance, websites operating from abroad might fabricate and publish false criticisms about our judiciary in order to achieve their personal agendas. If a publication by a politician or media has been made recklessly it would create a bad impression of the judiciary in the minds of the ordinary person.
Justice Michael Kirby has mentioned that “many attacks on judges are now made by politicians who see mileage in that course. The current level of political and personal attacks on the judiciary is unacceptable. It has gone too far…the judicial institution will be damaged and judicial integrity undermined”.
In the view of Justice Dr A R B Amarasinghe, “media has time to time reported allegations of misconducts like rape, immortality, fraud, corruption on the part of individual judges and criticisms like delay in justice, inefficiencies and injustices” (Judicial Conduct Ethics & Responsibilities 2014). Mass media report the bare facts of what Courts do, and what others say about judges without analysing and explicating their role properly (Miller 1970).
In ‘DPP Vs. Francis 2006’, a broadcaster who made a statement “oh, smash the judge’s face”, was convicted for contempt of Court. In the matter of ‘Armand De Souza 1914’, the defendant wrote in the newspaper that “the Police Magistrate of Nuwara Eliya having been himself at one stage in his career in the Ceylon Police- Force, is partial to the police view;…who is there to say what happens in his chambers”. Court held that the defendant’s language, as interpreted in the innuendoes, amounted to contempt of Court.
In the matter of ‘D M S B Dissanayake 2004’, respondent was convicted for contempt of court punishable under Article 105 (3) of the Constitution and was sentenced to a term of two years rigorous imprisonment for making statements which were interpreted as an attempt to undermine the public confidence in the judiciary and to adversely impact upon the due administration of justice.
In ‘AG Vs. Vaikunthavsasan 1951’, the respondent published an article containing matter which was calculated at prejudicing the fair trial of a case that was then pending before a Magistrate’s Court. Court held that an offender guilty of contempt of Court should not be permitted to go unpunished merely because he acknowledges his offence and expresses regret.
In the matter of ‘Hulugalle 1936’, the respondent was charged with contempt of Court in respect of certain passages appearing in a leading article, published in the newspaper. The article entitled “Justice on holiday”. Court held that the article imputed a serious breach of duty to the Judges of the Supreme Court and further held that the article was calculated by bringing the Supreme Court into contempt and to lower its authority.
According to the principles of rule of law, no one could be lawfully restrained or punished except for a violation of the law and everyone is governed equally by the law. The mere criticism of judiciary could make people disbelieve the said principles of rule of law.
In ‘State Vs. Ram Chander Sharma 1958’, it was held that the maintenance of the dignity of the Courts is one of the cardinal principles of the rule of law in a free democratic country and when the criticism which may otherwise be couched in language that appears to be mere criticism results in undermining the dignity of Courts and the course of justice in the land, it must be held repugnant and punished.
The Court in ‘Arundhati Roy 2002’, held that “Rule of Law is the basic rule of governance of any civilised democratic policy;...it is only through the Courts that the rule of law unfolds its contents and establishes its concept;…for the judiciary to perform its duties and functions effectively and true to the spirit with which it is sacredly entrusted, the dignity and authority of the Courts have to be respected and protected at all costs;…the confidence in the Courts of justice, which the people possess, cannot, in any way, be allowed to be tarnished, diminished or wiped out by the contumacious behaviour of any person…”.
The Sovereignty of Sri Lanka is vested in the people (Art.3 of the Constitution). It is a combination of legislative, executive, judicial bodies, fundamental rights and franchise. The judicial power of the people shall be exercised by Parliament through Courts, Tribunals and Institutions (Art.4 (c)). Hence, an unfair criticism of judiciary is a criticism of judicial power of people which is a part of the sovereignty of Sri Lanka.
In ‘Hewamanne Vs. De Silva 1983’, it was held that ‘the power vested in the Judges to safeguard the welfare and the security of the people is a delegated part of the sovereignty of the people. Contempt against the judges is, therefore, an insult offered to the authority of the People and their Constitution.
Sometimes people merely criticize judiciary due to delay in justice without properly analysing whether there were factors beyond the control of the judge. According to Miller, delay in justice is not necessarily attributable to judges alone; there are instances where judges may be unable to reach prompt decisions after the trial, possibly because the issues and evidence are so complex.
The remedy to avoid delay in justice is to expedite the process. (Public confidence in the Judiciary 1970) For instance, in order to avoid delay in criminal justice, judges were informed to ensure that indictments are served as early as possible after they are received (Circular No.272, Judicial Service Commission (JSC) (2002).
In ‘Attorney-General Vs. Butler 1953’, Court held that any publications which are calculated, or have a tendency, to impair confidence in the rule of law,…constitute contempt of Court unless they are made…with a proper respect for Courts as institutions established to administer the law in the interests of order, and the good government of the country. The court in ‘Gallagher Vs. Durack 1983’, held that the authority of the law rests on public confidence, and it is important to the stability of society that the confidence of the public should not be shaken by baseless attacks on the integrity or impartiality of Courts or judges.
Judges sometimes exhibit vanity, irascibility, narrowness, arrogance and other weaknesses to which the human flesh is the heir. They would make mistakes; they are human beings and not robots woven from steel mesh (In re Johnson 1978). Even if the judge knows the parties in person that would not harm the justice as long as he performs his duty honestly. The mere fact that a party or a material witness being known to the judge is not a reason for the presiding judge to disqualify himself from hearing the case (Circular No.287, JSC 2004).
In ‘Chandradasa Nanayakkara Vs. Liyanage Cyril 1984’, accused had addressed the Magistrate in rude language, abused and threatened him. It was held by the Court that the outrageous nature of the acts committed by the respondent constitutes not only an affront to the dignity and authority of the Court but also a direct challenge to the fundamental supremacy of the law itself. Court held that it amounted to contempt of court.
According to Justice Michael Kirby, attacking judges by inaccurate generalisations panders to public prejudice. It reinforces stereotypes about the judiciary. Such conduct is unworthy of countries that claim to uphold fundamental rights and the rule of law. (A Universal Phenomenon 1998). For instance, if the ‘web mafia’ continue to attack upon the judiciary, “the people would lose the trust they have in the judiciary and take up arms to settle their scores; they would no longer go to Court” (Warnakulasuriya PC 2016)
Dealing with unfair criticism
If proper responses have not been taken against mere scandalising the Court, it would definitely affect the law and order. In the view of Justice Kirby, “it seems now to be an accepted obligation of Chief Justices and other senior judges to respond, on behalf of their Courts, to attack the Courts, their judgments, their personnel or the administration of justice itself. It is also a responsibility of the Bar to defend the judiciary, to correct blatant misinformation and to remind politicians, the media and others of the precious heritage of judicial neutrality and independence.”
He has further held, “Leaders of the legal profession, whatever their own general political persuasion, should speak up where judges are unfairly criticised by politicians and others for doing their independent duty. The Attorney-General, as the traditional leader of the legal profession, should do so in appropriate cases” (A Universal Phenomenon 1998). In the view of Justice Dr A R B Amarasinghe, “the bold spirits on the bench should be mindful of their duty to safeguard public confidence in the judiciary” (Judicial Conduct Ethics & Responsibilities 2014).
It is the duty of each generation of judges to ensure that public confidence in the judiciary is maintained (Commentary to Canon I, ABA Model Code 1990). Further, the political leaders should defend the judicial institution and individual judges when they come under improper personal and political criticism for doing their duty. No political interference from any quarter should be tolerated by the judiciary. The judiciary shall decide matters before them impartially…without any restrictions, improper influences, inducements, pressures, threats or interferences, direct or indirect, from any quarter or for any reason (Principle No.2, UN Principles on the Judiciary 1985).
Stabilising and reinforcing public confidence in the judiciary
Despite every ignoble criticism, judges should mete out justice ‘come hell or high-water’. In the view of Lord Francis Bacon, the place of justice is a hallowed place. Members of the judiciary are supposed to perform a function that is truly divine. If the independence of the judiciary comes under suspicion, it directly impacts upon the public confidence in it.
People should not make sweeping statements based on prejudices against such a holy institution like the judiciary. If the public confidence in the judiciary is eroded, law and order which is sacrosanct could collapse unleashing a chain of distressing events. Therefore, all those who have the welfare and the interest of this country should be sensitive to this issue and contribute to strengthen and uphold the public confidence in the judiciary in every possible avenue.
