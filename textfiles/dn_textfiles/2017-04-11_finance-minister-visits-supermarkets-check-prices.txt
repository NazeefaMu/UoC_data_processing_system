Finance Minister visits supermarkets to check on prices

Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayake made surprise visits to several super markets in Colombo on April 9 to ascertain whether they maintain standard commodity prices.
The minister talked to consumers and enquired them about commodity prices. Many consumer goods were sold at ordinary prices but certain super marketers were selling canned fish, sprats and powdered milk packets at different prices. The minister informed the Consumer Affairs Authority in this regard.
“We engaged in a similar surprise visit to Colombo wholesale market recently and, enquired about prices of consumer goods in the market. Later we worked out how much should be the price of each item when it reaches the retail outlets. During this visit, we came to know that not only the ordinary retail shops but also super markets sell goods at lower prices,” the minister said.
“Several places sold goods at high prices. We complained about such places to the Consumer Affairs Authority. Price differences were observed in powered milk and specially sprats, though price of sprats is already controlled. However, 80 - 85 percent of goods are sold under low prices,” he said.
The minister said a relief sack of essential items will be provided to consumers with effect from tomorrow. The sack of 10 items worth Rs.1,515 will be provided at Rs.975 under the programme during the New Year season until April 20. Potatoes, big onion, rice, sprats, sugar, canned fish, chopped chilies, gram and powdered milk will include in the relief package. One million sacks will be distributed throughout the country and it costs the Ministry Rs. 540 million.
“We cleared that there is no shortage of consumer items in the market as charged by bankrupted politicians. Therefore, it is the duty of the media to disseminate this message to the people in this country. A rice kg was sold at Rs.110 at the time we assumed power on January 8, 2015. When it is dropped to Rs.75, they shout. Dhal was Rs.230–240 at that time, and it is Rs.157 today, he said.
“Powdered milk was Rs. 425 at that time; it is Rs.210–300 today. Fuel and LP Gas are available at reduced rates today. A cylinder of LP Gas was sold at Rs.2,635 at that time and it is dropped to Rs.1350 today. Kerosene was Rs. 80 at that time and it is Rs.45 today. Relief has been brought to the ordinary people today. These current prices should be further reduced. A programme is afoot under the guidance of the President and the Prime Minister to make that programme a success,” the minister said.
MPs Kavinda Jayawardana and Harshana Rajakaruna were present.
