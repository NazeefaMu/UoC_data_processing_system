New Landmark in Bilateral relations between Russaia and Sri Lanka

Relations between Sri Lanka and Russia took to greater heights with President Maithripala Sirisena’s historical visit to Moscow at the invitation of his Russian counterpart Vladmir Putin.
His visit marked the first State visit by a Sri Lankan Head of State to Moscow after a lapse of 40 years.
Former Prime Minister Sirimavo Bandaranaike’s visit to Russia in 1974 cemented more closer ties in the field of economy, trade, tourism and technical cooperation. The then Soviet Union set up the Steel factory in Oruwala, tyre and tube factory in Kelaniya, four milling plants and a grain elevator in Trincomalee and the Sugar-cane plantation at Kantale. They are the symbols of sound relations between the two nations.
It was the then Prime Minister SWRD Bandaranaike government that recognized the Soviet Union and established diplomatic relations. President Maithripala Sirisena who arrived at Domodedovo International Airport received a warm welcome from the Russian officials.
The visiting president was received by Deputy Foreign Minister of Russia Igor Morgulov. Russian President Vladimir Putin pledged to enhance long term economic cooperation and affirmed to build a strong foundation to take bilateral relations to a net height when he met Sri Lankan President Maithripala at Kremlin on Thursday evening.
The Sri Lankan delegation led by President Maithripala Sirisena participated in a special ceremony to mark 60 years of diplomatic relations between the two nations.
The President also met the first woman to have travelled to space and Russian politician Vladimirovna Tershkova at this ceremony
