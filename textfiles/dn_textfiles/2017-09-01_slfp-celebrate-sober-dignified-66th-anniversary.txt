SLFP to celebrate sober, dignified 66th anniversary

Fisheries Minister and UPFA General Secretary Minister Mahinda Amaraweera said the 66th anniversary of the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) will be the biggest event in the recent political history and it will be free of alcohol.
Addressing a media briefing held in Colombo yesterday, he said Presiedent Maithripala Sirisena has instructed all electoral organisers that alcohol will be strictly prohibited during the event.
The 64th anniversary of the SLFP was held in Polonnaruwa with the participation of about 10,000 supporters after President Srisena took over the leadership of the party in January 2015.
The 65th anniversary was held in Kurunegala with the participation of a record number of people including the large number of people from the North and the East and it was a biggest successful rally in the history.
He said the 66th anniversary would see the largest attendance for a party anniversary in the country in the recent past.
"Passenger buses heve been hired from the Sri Lanka Transport Board (SLTB) and the private sector after payment and no State transport service, property or funds were abused for the SLFP anniversary".
"We will introduce the future Political Programme of the party at the event.We have invited all parties including members of the Joint Opposition. The event will be held under the theme of a pure and clean national political campaign for the future of the country.
It is the whole aim of the President creating a SLFP as a pure and clean political party.
"The President has instructed us not to entertain any corruption and fraud because he will be compelled to take action against each individual regardless of their position. The Minister further said that the SLFP leadership and the members have now reached the decisive moment that action has to be taken against those trying to split the SLFP through the formation of new party.
"We thought that they would unify with the party and now many party rankers in the grassroot level are questioning us as to why no action is being taken against these people.
He added that several media outlets which still strike fear of former President Mahinda Rajapaksa do not broadcast or telecast their voice cuts.
"They should not be afraid of their work as the Yahapalana Government has given media freedom suppressed by the dictatorship rule of Mahinda Rajapaksa," he said.
Local Government and Provincial Councils Minister Faizer Mustapha and State Minister of rehabilitation, Resettlement M.L.A.M. Hizbullah spoke.
