Promising future for dairy industry

Dairy continues to play an integral role in Sri Lankan culture, from being a regular feature at meal times and cultural occasions, to being a vital component of the local rural economy. With the demand for dairy increasing annually, a significant gap still exists between consumption and local supply, and there has been an observable refocus on enhancing and improving the local dairy industry to be more sustainable and profitable. For example, the 2017 Budget outlines many proposals targeted at supporting the local dairy industry, including a Rs. 400 million allocation to assist Sri Lankan dairy farmers. In this context, a critical and practical understanding of the industry and its needs are required to effectively move it forward.
Contributing to the economy
Dairy farming is a source of extensive employment opportunities. Currently, the local dairy animal population of 1.3 million produces approximately 38-42 percent of the total annual dairy consumption of Sri Lanka. Smallholder dairy farmers dominate the livestock industry with an estimated 300,000 registered farms, and of this, 72,400 people depend solely on dairy as their main source of income.
The local dairy sector is currently growing at a rate of 7.5percent, and this will need to double to about 15 percent annually for the next eight years, while total consumption remains static, to meet complete consumer demand. This is a challenging task, given the current state of the industry.
Small holder dairy farmers who supply about 94percent of the milk collected in Sri Lanka are mostly from rural and plantation areas, and often run their dairy farms with inadequate dairying knowledge and training, and face difficulties in the following areas:
1. Insufficient and unproductive stock; and replacing these animals is very expensive compared to output.
2. Access to newer dairy related technologies that contribute to better productivity from the limited land available.
3.Lack of extension services especially regarding the nutrition of dairy animals.
4. Insufficient veterinary services have given rise to the formation of many quackers in the livestock sector, endangering ‘food safety’.
5. Food safety issues due to certain forage stores, especially in the up-country area, selling all veterinary items – including anti-microbial hormones – without a prescription.
6. Newly established livestock farms employing non-professional personnel to treat their animals, which creates an animal welfare issue.
In this regard, the companies that are involved in milk collection could play a large role in bridging this gap, as they have greater access to farmer communities. In addition to being involved in milk collection, these companies can provide their farmer suppliers with additional training and education to help address the issues outlined above.
Moving towards a sustainable industry
The Government has set an ambitious target to achieve an increase in self-sufficiency in dairy production by 2020, and it has put forward plans through the “National Food Production Programme”.
Moreover, the previous and current governments have implemented some important measures to develop the sector by increasing the farm gate milk price and giving tax concessions to dairy related machineries and equipment.
However, this in itself is not sufficient, and local dairy farmers need to develop better skills in dairy farming in order to build a profitable business and contribute to closing the gap between demand for dairy and local supply.
Importance of training and education
Since 2010, we have witnessed some improvement in the participation of the private sector in the dairy industry, where some of the leading companies have implemented training and development programmes which will undoubtedly have a positive impact on the sector and on the economy of the country.
An example of an initiative that will have a positive impact on the industry is the establishment of a fully-fledged training farm in Pannala, Kuliyapitiya. At the farm, dairy farmers, extension officers and local veterinarians are exposed to various aspects of dairy farming including dairy farming as an enterprise, feeding practices, handling dairy related machinery and animal health. The most interesting aspect of the training sessions at the Pannala demonstration farm is the pragmatic approach which is tailored to suit the needs of local farmers, who can apply the knowledge they acquire using available resources to increase the productivity of their farms and the animals.
Milk is currently collected through a combination of private and public organisations working in tandem with each other. Total milk collection has increased by 22 percent in 2014-2015 largely due to the increased price paid for milk, which has risen from Rs.33.50 per litre in 2010 to Rs.65-70.00 per litre in 2015. An improved collection network has also played an important role.
Sanctioned by the government, institutions and companies in the dairy industry have formed public-private partnerships to conduct training programmes for those working within the sector, with a focus on educating farmers on the basics of dairy farming, animal nutrition and welfare, and running a sustainable farm business.
These initiatives have encouraged the industry to flourish in a number of ways:
1. There are examples of farmers who have increased milk production from 4-6 litres of milk per cow to 10-12 litres per cow per day, through the introduction of Good Management Practices (GMP) such as feed management, animal nutrition, animal welfare, milk quality management and so on. However the average still hovers around 5 litres.
2. Similarly, some dairy farmers with indigenous breeds of cattle that yielded 2-3 litres of milk per day, have boosted their milk yield to 6-8 litres by replacing their cows with breeds of cattle with stronger genetics.
3. Greater investment and the introduction of new technologies have seen an influx of new entrepreneurs into the dairy sector.
These results demonstrate just a hint of the abundant potential of the Sri Lankan dairy industry, and what is achievable through proper farm business practices.
It is vital that all those involved, including the Government, dairy farmers, milk processors and dairy producers, work in partnership towards the unified goal of a progressive and sustainable dairy sector, and ultimately close the gap in meeting the country’s demand for dairy.
