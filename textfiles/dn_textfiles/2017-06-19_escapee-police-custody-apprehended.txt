Escapee from police custody apprehended

A suspect held in the Minuwangoda Police cell who had escaped from police custody on the pretext of going to the toilet was apprehended by police assisted by residents in Nilapaniyagoda on June 17 morning.
The 22-year-old suspect, a resident of Katuwellegama, Palugahawela, was first arrested by police with several others on June 16 during an anti crime operation.
He had been locked up in the cell pending investigations.
When other suspects in the cell were asleep he had left the cell on the pretext of going to the toilet and escaped by breaking its wall.
An assistant policeman who took over duties on June 17 morning had checked the suspects in the cell and found one of them missing and reported the matter to the authorities. Police had later launched an operation to locate the missing and arrested him with the help of the residents.
An initial investigation revealed that the dilapidated condition of the building was one reason that helped suspects escape from police custody.
Investigation are continuing.
