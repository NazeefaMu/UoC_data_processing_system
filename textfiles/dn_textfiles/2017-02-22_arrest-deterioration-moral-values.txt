Arrest, deterioration of moral values

It is unfortunately observed that in recent times there has been a serious deterioration in the moral standards of the country. Perhaps this is true not only of Sri Lanka but for most parts of the world. It is not only the number of cases of violence that is increasing rapidly but also the rising brutality of such incidence.
These phenomena in Sri Lanka considered the land of the Buddha where more than 2/3rd of the population comprises of Buddhists cannot be easily condoned. Some would say that with the increase of population and the greater media visibility the number of recorded crimes would naturally rise. However, leaving allowance for these factors, still crimes appear to be on the rise.
On the other hand, the brutality in killings is also increasing with the torturing of the victim prior to the killing. Eyes are removed, the tongues are cut and such kind of torture where the victim often appeals to the torturer to put a quick end to his life.
Dhamma sermons
In this situation the Buddhist monks has the capacity to play an important positive role, especially those monks in the rural areas where the relationship between the monks and the laity are strong and the people in the village are known to each other.
In this connection, it should be noted that Arahats, who have attained the supreme bliss of Nibbana, have an internal urge realizing how happy they are to encourage and help others to follow the path and achieve liberation.
Apart from exhorting the people to lead virtuous life at Dhamma sermons, the monks could play a more active part by visiting the areas where violence and even murders are likely to occur. News travels fast in the village and monks could personally visit likely explosive areas to desist those likely to engage in violence. They could play the role of honest mediators when violence and murders are likely to arise where they have built for themselves a reputation of being fair and just in all situations. If it is a family dispute pertaining to property they could be advised to seek the assistance of commissions and tribunals established by the Government consisting of honourable persons held in high regard by society.
Noble eightfold path
Different monks could and do specialize in different areas depending on their inclinations and aptitudes. Some would concentrate on their personal development to realize the Buddhist goal of Nibbana, the liberation from all the unsatisfactory features of life such as impermanence, unsatisfactoriness and the absence of a permanent, unchanging ego or self.
Some would be inclined to preach the Dhamma and induce people to follow the Noble eightfold path and realize early the freedom from Dukkha, the unsatisfactory aspects of life including old age, disease and death.
Reflecting the imminence of death which could be traumatic to some old people with rising agitation the main fear is the “undiscovered country”, to use a term from William Shakespeare’s Hamlet – his outstanding master piece.
One does not know what lies ahead after death. This would be especially so with those who have led unethical lives recollecting their past foul deeds.
In such situations some monks or even laymen with knowledge of the Dhamma could have the ability to calm the agitated and enable them to pass away somewhat peacefully.
For those who have led reasonably good and fair lives with consideration for the welfare of others and society, they could be reminded of their good deeds which would give them confidence to face death and beyond.
On the other hand, for those who had led not so ethical lives, they could be told not to think of one’s bad actions because as the Buddha explained there is nothing that could be done to eliminate what has already been done.
However they could establish a firm determination not to do unwholesome actions even in the few days of available life with thoughts of goodwill and best wishes to all living beings- mankind, animals and even invisible beings. A mind full of such thoughts would be an asset at the time of death.
Thus, the monks have a vital role to protect and advance the moral standards of the people and the ability to enable them to exist from this life calmly and gracefully.
May all beings be well and happy.
