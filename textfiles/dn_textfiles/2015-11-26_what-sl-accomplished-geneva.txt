What SL accomplished at Geneva

Some politicians and a section of their retinue seem to misinterpret the recent Sri Lanka co-sponsored United Nations Human Rights Council Resolutions in Geneva as a threat to the sovereignty of the state of Sri Lanka. Their illogical and unreasonable arguments seem to be an attempt to mystify and bamboozle a section of the innocent people of this country.
As we all know, the attitude of the UN Human Rights Council was not favourable to Sri Lanka during the period of the previous government. We then lost the vote in Geneva and were granted time till March 2015.
The inevitable next step would have been the imposition of economic sanctions - but not the misleading, rhetoric and manipulated, slogan of the electric chair on the eve of most elections.
We had already been deprived of the GSP+ concession. Our fish exports to the European market had been banned. Restoration of these concessions is in the offing following the January 8 election and especially after the Geneva Resolutions.
The deprivation of GSP+ by the US was a significant obstacle to our garment industry and foreign exchange earnings. The next step would have been imposition of various major economic sanctions. It is the poor in this country who suffers most in a situation like that.
Thus, the functioning of the UN Human Rights Commission is not a novel arrangement orchestrated to trap Sri Lanka, as some people inadvertently or ignorantly or maliciously propagate.
Universal Declaration of Human Rights emerged following the proclamation by the UN General Assembly on December 10, 1948, whereas the Charter of the United Nations signed on June 26, 1945, in San Francisco and came into force on October 24, 1945.
All member countries were called upon: “to publicize the text of the Human Rights Declaration of 1948 and to cause it to be disseminated, displayed, read and expounded principally in schools and other educational institutions, without distinction based on the political status of countries or territories.”
Now, in our country, those who disagree with the Geneva resolutions, inter alia, raised the following three basic issues probably with a view to give vent to their own interpretation.
1. Interfering with the sovereignty of the state
2. Creating a hybrid judiciary
3. Entertaining foreign expertise into the country.
When we answer the above questions succinctly within the confines of this space, the first question ‘Sovereignty’ of a state is meaningful only when it ‘binds’ itself with other states, organizations in the performance of reciprocal duties and obligations. We are ‘bound’ by the UN Charter; Human Right Commissions covenants etc, and we are expected to respect them and uphold them. We have pledged to do so (even individual liberty has its limitations to respect the liberty of other individuals and rest of the society). Eminent political scientists such as Prof. Harold Laski, Prof. Krishna Peasanna, Mukerji prefer the notion of ‘Supremacy’ to ‘sovereignty’. Mukerji in his celebrated work ‘The State’, ventures to suggest his ethico-evolutionary definition of the state and he advocated legal ‘supremacy’ as against sovereignty.
Hybrid judiciary
Regarding the hybrid judiciary issue, it is pertinent to draw the attention to our constitution: Establishment of courts is governed by section 105(1) (a),(b),(c) of the constitution of the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka. Further, Section 105(2) ensures, that: “............Parliament may replace or abolish, or amend the powers, jurisdiction and procedure of, such courts, tribunals and institutions. “Similarly, section 7 of article 2 of the Charter of the United Nations clearly states that: “Nothing contained in the present Charter shall authorize the United Nations to intervene in matters which are essentially within the domestic jurisdiction of any state.”
Entertaining foreign expertise seeking expert opinion on a matter of importance is an ad-hoc arrangement made by most countries whenever necessity demands. This facility was made use of during the time of Paranagama Commission too.
Historically, foreign experts of varied disciplines carried out reconnaissance missions on our invitation or on their own and nobody objected to their presence. For example, a team of world renowned economists visited this country in 1960s, familiarized with the economic situation of the country and prepared individual invaluable advisory papers covering macro-economic issues substantiated by micro-economic concepts. Thus, the compilation named ‘Papers By Visiting Economists’ emerged.
Yet another criticism by some dissidents is that our representatives had failed to bargain in Geneva in 2015 with regard to co-sponsored resolutions and had simply agreed to said resolutions in toto. In this instance, we should not be unreasonable as to forget that the subsequent co-sponsored resolutions had dropped the names of forty eight persons embodied in the UN Human Rights Commissioner’s resolutions. As the removal of those 48 names from the UNHRC’s resolutions being a major triumph, perhaps bargaining any further on the remaining solvable matters would have been treated as unethical, irrational and provocative.
United we cherish divided we perish
At this crucial juncture, what is needed is reconciliation and not conflict: unity and not division: consolation and not creating fear psychosis in the country, making unduly use of arsenal of invective, kindling chauvinism. We want ethical, religious and political harmony, justice and fairplay and not distrust, fear and divisiveness. Our country needs statesmen and not mere ‘politicians’ manoeuvring for power and self aggrandizement.
Untiring efforts, tact, diplomacy, goodwill and non-alignment of the trio: the President, the Prime Minister and the Foreign Minister, brought about a ‘renaissance’ in friendship, good relations and recognition amongst most nations of the world and the resultant progressive and cheerful image may be highly productive in our present and future relations with Geneva.
