Police look for three-member gang, tuition master

Anuradhapura police launched investigations to nab a three-member gang led by a person nicknamed S.F. Lokka.
They had come in a white van and hijacked a tuition master's luxury vehicle, which was being taken to Colombo on April 21 by vehicle seizers for non-payment of lease premium.
Police investigations revealed that the gang had taken the vehicle valued at nearly Rs. 15 million and handed it back to the tuition master who had taken it to Polonnaruwa and lodged a complaint at the Polonnaruwa Police saying three men arrived at his tuition institute and demanded the keys to his vehicle at knifepoint and he fled to Pollonnaruwa to escape from them.
Police are also looking for the tuition master who is alleged to have paid Rs. 100,000 to the gang led by S.F. Lokka, a suspect in the Vasantha Soysa murder case, to get his vehicle back from the custody of the vehicle seizers.
