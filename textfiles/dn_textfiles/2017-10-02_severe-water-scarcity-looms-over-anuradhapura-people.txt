Severe water scarcity looms over Anuradhapura people

People in Anuradhapura fear that they will not receive drinking water in the near future. The city has over 300,000 population who now undergo severe drought.
The Mahaweli Water Control Committee and the Mahaweli Authority supply water to Nuwarawewa, Thuruwila and Tisawewa responding to the requests made by the Anuradhapura GA, Water Supply and Drainage Board (NCP) and the Irrigation Authorities, Chief Irrigation Engineer Jayantha Silva said.
"We requested to provide 8,000 acre feet (a.f.) of Mahaweli water to the Nachchaduwa tank. The tank will retain 5000 a.f and release the balance to the Nuwarawewa through a feeder canal," he said. "We have arranged to get 1,000 a.f of water from the Nachchaduwa to Nuwarawewa. Nuwarawewa water has gone down to 6,000 a.f where it should have been 36,050 a.f. It is hardly enough to supply drinking water to the city and its suburb," Anuradhapura Irrigation Engineer P.U.K. Tilakaratne said.
Plans are afoot to get water from the Malwathuoya anicut area if the drought continues. A spokesman of the board said water would be pumped to the Nuwarawewa Purifying Plant though a three km long pipe line.
At present, 15, 000 cubic metres of water is purified and provided daily from the Nuwarawewa.
