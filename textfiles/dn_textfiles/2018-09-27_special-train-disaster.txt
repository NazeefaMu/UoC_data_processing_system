Special train, a disaster

The special train targeting tourists from Mount Lavinia to Rambukkana became a non starter with the high price tag put by the Railways Department.
The price for a one way journey was announced at Rs 3000 per head. The inaugural trip was done with no passengers on board except for the driver, assistant and the guard.
The Railways Department said it had decided to cancel this train. Regular travellers said it would have been prudent if the train had plied to either Kandy or Badulla with a second class fare that could have attracted a much better passenger load.
