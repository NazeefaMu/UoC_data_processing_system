Private bus fares to be reduced tonight

Private bus fares will be reduced by 2 percent from midnight, today.
All private bus associations agreed to reduce bus fares in line with the reduction of diesel prices by the new government, at a discussion held with National Transport Commission (NTC) Chairman M.A.P Hemachandra, yesterday.
Inter-Provincial Private Bus Association (IPPBA) President Sarath Vijitha Kumara told the Daily News the decision was taken in support of the new government.
“Although a bus fare reduction is not possible according to the existing policy, we have agreed to this concession for the benefit of the commuters,” he said.
Kumara said that Cabinet would be informed about the decision.
“The minimum charge will not be changed,” he said.
