CITADEL OF  PATRIOTISM

Old Boys’ Union – 1993 Group
“Ananda College imparted education to many men of action who played prominent roles to uphold the interests of the people and country, religion and culture by infiltrating the slaves who embraced the alien culture then and held in high esteem the worldly pleasure provided by them than the freedom of the people and religion”, is a quoted passage written by an old boy of Ananda College and an anti-imperialist freedom fighter Philip Gunawardena.
The above statement clearly illustrates the reasons for the birth of Ananda College, Colombo which is engaged in rendering social services and walking majestically even today after reaching 131 years on November 1, 2017.
Vision of the College
Despite the fact that the Anandians were more proficient in the English language than the Englishmen, they stood by their principles without becoming slaves to it. The then Principal of Ananda College L.H. Mettananda and the academics of Ananda College strongly agitated to grant the foremost place to the mother tongue, Sinhala language and that it should be made the official language.
In addition, when they voiced that the Science subject could not be taught in Sinhala, the intellectuals such as the then Principal of Ananda College M.W. Karunananda strongly expressed that the Science subject could be taught in Sinhala language and engaged himself in the task of writing and publishing the books needed in Sinhala. Hence, the contribution made by Ananda College in making the Sinhala as the official language is immeasurable.
Ananda College laid the foundation for the establishment of many schools similar to the branches spreading from a tree. As a result of that, glittering schools such as Dharmaraja College, Kandy, Mahinda College, Galle, Rahula College, Matara and Maliyadeva College, Kurunegala emerged. The main reason for Ananda College to march forward even after passing a hundred years was because from the very inception did not have any differences or discordant views. Anandians who held their own ethnic group in high esteem never displayed racism. While they showed due respect to Buddhism never displayed any differences or discordant views about any other religions.
This situation was understood by many from the very beginning. Hence, the Christian priest Reverend Father Leadbeater who became the very first Principal of Ananda College took steps to teach Buddhism not only to the students but also to the teachers according to the vision of the College. Even though the subsequent school Principals Bultjens, Davies Moor and Fritz Kunz belonged to different ethnic communities and religions, they worked with firm determination from the day they assumed duties as Principals of Ananda College to establish a future generation of Buddhists following the right path. The endeavour made by the experts belonging to other ethnic communities such as T.B. Jayah, A.H. Sundararaman, V.T.S. Sivagurunathan and E.M. Selvaratnam in the Administrative Committee to attain the vision of Ananda College was indeed a marvellous deed.
Great personalities
Those who were appointed as Principals of Ananda College, irrespective of their status, dedicated their services considering the country first and made gigantic efforts to create great personalities the country needed. That was indeed a stupendous feat. Among them the services rendered by Sir D.B. Jayatillake, P. De S. Kularatne, Professor G.P. Malalasekara, L.H. Mettananda, M.W. Karunananda, Colonel G.W. Rajapaksa, Colonel V.S. Kudaligama, A.P. Gunaratne T.B. Damunupola and Kithsiri Liyanagamage to the country should be held in high esteem.
The vision of Ananda College to create dynamic personalities and achieving that task within a hundred years is indeed a matter to be proud of. Hence, the incumbent Principal S.M. Keerthiratne and the Administrative Committee, the Old Boys’ Union, the students along with the Buddhist populace should be determined to forge ahead on the occasion of the 131st anniversary of Ananda College.
