Protest against shortcomings at school

Parents and past pupils of Chilaw St. Mary's Boys Vidyalaya conducted a protest campaign, blocking the Chilaw Zonal Education Office, yesterday morning, demanding quick solutions to problems and shortcomings confronting the school.
They assembled near the school premises and explained the reasons for the protest after religious observances. Thereafter, they went in procession and held the demonstration blocking the Zonal Education Office.
The protesters pointed out that the St. Mary's school currently had a shortage of 17 teachers as well as an acute shortage of buildings. Apart from this, a newly opened school building had cracks due to poor construction. The derelict old school building had not been demolished and removed, posing danger to students’ lives. The computer unit had not been equipped with a single computer and the newly built playground is threatened with destruction they pointed out to the Zonal Director of Education.
However, Zonal Director of Education Sadhamangala Subasinghe said he was unable to provide quick solutions since he too was in a helpless situation. He said when he executed teacher transfers, the transferred teachers got their transfers deferred through political patronage. When he requested new buildings for needy schools by giving them preference, politicians acted according to their whims and fancies by ignoring preference lists. He had no funds available with him to produce computers either, he said.
As the situation became restive with the Zonal Director and protectors exchanging heated worlds, another female employee of the Zonal Education office came to the scene and dragged the Director back into the office premises in an attempt to prevent him from divulging the true plight.
Then the protectors tried to forcibly enter the Zonal Director's office but they were prevented by the police.
Thereafter, the protectors visited the Chilaw Bishop's House and participated in a discussion.
