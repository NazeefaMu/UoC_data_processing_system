Hospitals to be powered by solar panels

 
Health Minister Rajitha Senarathne proposed to fix solar panels in hospitals island-wide under the ‘Suryabala Sangramaya’ project.
The monthly electricity bill of hospitals is approximately Rs. 3 million and annually it amounts to several billions the Minister said.
He said that in addition to this, another million is spent on repairs.
Minister Senaratne proposed this, intending to minimise the amount spent for electricity by hospitals, from the national grid.
