Initiated by the Department of Government Information and SLRC
‘Towards Democracy in Sri Lanka’  documentary series  to be launched

A documentary series titled ‘Towards Democracy in Sri Lanka’ will be launched at the Department of Government Information (DGI) auditorium on May 24 at 3pm.
This documentry series was put together by the Department of Government Information (DGI) and Sri Lanka Rupavahini Corporation (SLRC).
Democracy is a system of rule by laws and values backed by the contribution of individuals. In a democratic country, the rule of law protects the rights of citizens, maintains order, and limits the power of government. All citizens are equal under the law. The four main pillars Equity, representation, freedom and justice are vital for democracy. Sri Lanka is on a steady march achieving these goals.
During the last regime Sri Lanka witnessed an authoritarian practice, weakening of the rule of law due to centralization of power by the executive, shrinking of space for human rights and dissent and the exacerbation of the culture of impunity. Politicization of independent institutions and the lack of investigation and prosecution into serious human rights abuses were seen. The political interferences hindered the operations of various independent institutions that included the Human Rights Commission and National Police Commission. Thus they were unable to play a significant role in taking action against perpetrators. These developments resulted in brining a negative image on Sri Lanka in the face of international community.
A major concern relating to the Independence of the Judiciary was the impeachment of former Chief Justice by Parliament and the Executive disregarding the Supreme Court judgment and the Court of Appeal order and protests by Bar Association of Sri Lanka. Also the time witnessed several appointments made to the Superior Courts of individuals who were perceived as close to the Executive. Freedom of association and assembly were subject to severe threat. Attacks against journalists and the failure to address the impunity for crimes against journalists particularly those attacked and killed in the Northern and Eastern provinces was a failure. Similarly worrying trends of surveillance, intimidation and militarization, continued attacks against religious minorities and the inability or unwillingness to hold perpetrators to account for a range of rights violations have contributed to an apprehension among many at the prevailing culture of impunity and the state’s inaction, with concerns raised of the inability to reign in extremist forces.
Justification:
The situation with regard to democracy since January 2015 has seen a remarkable improvement under the leadership of President MaithreepalaSirisena and Prime Minister RanilWickremesinghe through the unity government. The government intention is to re-establish the lost democracy and it had various cardinal measures in this regard. However, it is not an easy thing to achieve democracy overnight as it is a continuous and time consuming process.
The benefits of democracy are not a short time that people can feel or see but it has a long time impact and benefits for the people. With the change of government in January 2015 and subsequent introduction of a few reforms, some structural changes and improvements are evident. For further developing the path towards democracy it is vital to educate and engage the public in the discourse. Thus SLRC and DGI along with the support of the Ministry of Mass Media are proposing a docu-drama series on democracy.
