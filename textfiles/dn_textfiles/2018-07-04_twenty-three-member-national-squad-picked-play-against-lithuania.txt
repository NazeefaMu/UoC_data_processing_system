Football Federation of Sri Lanka is gearing to showcase ‘Football Extravaganza on our home soil after a long gap when Sri Lanka National Team plays against Europeans Lithuania on the 8th July 2018 at 6.30 PM at Race Course.
A Couple of weeks ago, FFSL arranged a media conference in a different style to promote this event under the theme of “International Football is Back” which was staged quite successfully. The management convened a special press conference yesterday to announce the final squad of 23 players who will take part in the match against Lithuania on the 8th of July 2018
The players are relatively young, however looks solid in terms of fitness and commitment. Although the new team is short of International match experience, many positive approaches are expected from the new Coach Nizam Packeer Ali. Sri Lanka is looking forward to see some success story from this young team and it is certain that whatever result it could be, Sri Lanka fans will support this young team and cheer them until they play the SAFF Championship in September 2018.
FFSL is inviting all fans and public to visit the Race Course grounds on Sunday 8th July at 6.30 PM to show the solidarity with the young National Team.
