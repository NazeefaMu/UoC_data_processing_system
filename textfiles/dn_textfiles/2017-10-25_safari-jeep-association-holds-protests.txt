Safari Jeep Association holds protests

There was a tense situation near the wildlife office on the Yala-Katagamuwa access road as members of the Safari Jeep Association decided to turn away tourist jeeps entering the Yala Sanctuary from Katagamuwa as a protest against the decision taken by the Wildlife Department to limit the number of safari jeeps entering the Yala Sanctuary, yesterday.
This forced wildlife authorities to Summon the Tissamaharama Police to maintain peace.
The wildlife has implemented a rule to allow only 50 jeeps to enter the sanctuary from the Katugamuwa entrance and only 100 jeeps to enter from the Palatupane entrance.
Tissamaharama Police OIC Inspector Jude De Silva addressing the protesting safari jeep owners, advised them to resolve the problem peacefully through discussion with the relevant authorities. Kadirapura Safari Jeep owners Association Secretary Vasantha Vithanage said they have to pay lease installments in respect of their vehicles and a large number of youth stand to lose their jobs due to the new decision to limit entry to jeeps.
He said this had discouraged tourists from visiting Yala and the number of visitors had also dropped sharply.
