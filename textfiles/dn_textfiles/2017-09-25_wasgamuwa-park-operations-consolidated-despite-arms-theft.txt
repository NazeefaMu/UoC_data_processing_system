Wasgamuwa Park operations consolidated despite arms theft

Wasgamuwa National Park's operations are continuing despite last Thursday’s firearms theft from the Park’s armoury, Wasgamuwa National Park Warden, R.A.D.D. Samaranayaka said yesterday.
He said the Park’s safari services, wildlife bungalow bookings and other services have gone along without any interruption in spite of the weapons going missing.
The burglars had broken two doors and two armoury lockers of the Wasgamuwa National Park office and stolen two shot guns, two repeaters and a T-56 assault rifle.
Samaranayaka said the loss of weapons did not disrupt Park’s operations or their services.
"We have weapons to keep things going,”he said.
He said two police teams from the Wilgamuwa Police and the Matale Police Crimes Investigation Division were investigating into the incident.
