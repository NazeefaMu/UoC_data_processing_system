I see this as a humble beginning of a solid journey and it is very satisfying for me to be a part of this. This Award program is a springboard in building relationships and creating networking possibilities between Sri Lankan origin women in Canada and members of WIM Sri Lanka with the intention of supporting one another and building successful business.
