CCC’s economy.lk launches ‘Corporate Snapshot’

With the agenda of furthering the economic discussion in Sri Lanka, economy.lk brings you views, news and opinions on the latest of the Sri Lankan economy.
The digital platform functions on Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, Linkedin, YouTube and its website, and is dedicated to disseminating information on key economic and business sectors in the Sri Lankan economy.
Curated by the Secretariat of the Ceylon Chamber of Commerce (CCC), economy.lk began its operations on July 25, 2017 and today marks the reach of its first milestone – 1 year of insightful dialogue on economic and financial issues, trade, policies and views from key influential individuals both in the local and global business sphere.
Today, economy.lk announces the launch of its “Corporate Snapshot” – a weekly round-up of corporate news exclusive to Dialog users who subscribe by typing Reg<space>economylk and sending it to 77177. Everything you need to know on how the week progressed is available in a concise, easy-to-digest 3 minute snapshot. The scope of economy.lk further covers in-depth exploration of the Sri Lankan economy with its monthly economic updates, brief blog-style articles on current issues, and the airing of “Front Row” every Wednesday at 4pm - a YouTube series featuring acclaimed business leaders, policy makers, economists and thought leaders from both Sri Lanka and overseas.
Over the past year, economy.lk had the privilege of featuring personalities such as Sanjeev Sanyal, Economic Advisor to the Government of India; Shashank Srivastava, Former CEO and Board Member of Qatar International Financial Centre; Dr. Harsha Vardhana Singh, Executive Director, Brookings India; Arun Miranda, Chairman and Managing Director, Trinity Steel (Pvt.) Ltd, Sri Lanka; Dr. Amitendu Palit, Senior Research Fellow, the National University of Singapore; S Iswaran, Minister for Trade and Industry in Singapore; Ranil Jayawardena, MP, UK; David Stanford, CIMA President; Philip Dalidakis MP, State Government of Victoria, Australia; Dr. Arvind Subramanian, Chief Economic Advisor - Government of India; and many other industry experts. Innovation and technology, environment, foreign policy, and Sri Lanka’s investment climate are a few topics that have been explored on Front Row thus far.
The platform will continue to progress and contribute to Sri Lanka’s economic growth by discussing and raising awareness on the critical economic and business topics.
Being informed is the first step in a positive direction of addressing issues and bringing about impactful change. The team extends a heartfelt thank you to all of its followers, and all those who have contributed to its discourse over the last 365 days.
