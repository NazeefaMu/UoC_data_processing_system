Lopez teams up with Anthony again

Jennifer Lopez is working on a new album and she’s teaming up with her ex-husband Marc Anthony to bring it to market. The singer, actress and entrepreneur has picked a project that celebrates her roots, recording all the songs of her next production in Spanish.
The former couple previously collaborated on her hit album ‘Como Ama Una Mujer,’ which debuted at No. 10 on the U.S. Billboard 200 all-genre chart in 2007, proving language is no barrier to cross-market appeal.
Anthony’s entertainment company, Magnus Media, and Sony Music Latin will develop, produce and release the yet unnamed album, which will be Lopez’s first all-Spanish album in a decade.
“I am so excited and really looking forward to this new musical journey and to celebrate my Latin roots with Marc Anthony and the Sony/Magnus family,” Lopez said in a statement.
Although it’s been almost a decade since she released a Spanish-language album, in recent years she has teamed up with other Latino artists, including Pitbull, Ricky Martin and Wisin y Yandel to record hit singles in English and Spanish such as “On the Floor,” “Follow the Leader,” and “Adrenalina.” Earlier this year, she also collaborated with Lin-Manuel Miranda to record “Love Make the World Go Round.” The song was released as a digital charity single as a tribute to the victims of the 2016 Orlando nightclub shooting.
Given her superstar status and popularity, J-Lo can pick projects based on what piques her interest.
“She’s one of the few people who can chose. How cool is that? She can say I know that I want to do this and know people will buy it,” says industry veteran Peggy Dold, who worked in the Latin music industry for 17 years and is now the CEO of entertainment consulting firm Navigation Partners LLC.
“I don’t think there’s a risk here,” Dold says about Lopez launching a new album in Spanish.
“She has proven she’s willing to go out on a limb. She works really hard. She’s got a great profile: she’s a great dancer, executive, and actor. But she’s also a bicultural American who has always represented her people and the new album will probably resonate with a large audience. My prediction is that Jennifer will deliver a fabulous record.”
