Probe into NLB’s alleged misuse of funds

The Financial Crime Investigation Division (FCID) commenced an investigation to find out if over Rs. 150 million of the National Lotteries Board (NLB) had been misused during the 2015 presidential election period by spending on advertisements not relevant to the institution. The COPE Committee revealed that Rs. 152,754,960 had been misused in such a manner from 2013 to 2014 and November 2014 to February 2015. The details of the misuse were revealed in the third COPE report presented to Parliament on February 8 by COPE Chairman Sunil Handunnetti.
