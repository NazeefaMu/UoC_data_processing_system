Prince Harry pays tribute to terror victims

AUSTRALIA: Prince Harry Wednesday paid tribute to victims of the London terror attack as he marked 100 days until the next Invictus Games, after it emerged two Australians were among the dead in the latest British atrocity.
Harry, patron of the games for injured and sick service personnel, was in Sydney to promote the sporting extravaganza he said proved it was possible to overcome adversity.
“I would like to start by sending my thoughts to those affected by Saturday's attack in London Bridge,” the former soldier said as rain pounded down outside Admiralty House, home of the Queen’s representative in Australia Peter Cosgrove.
“Australians form an important and vibrant part of the fabric of life in London and we are reminded of that in good times and bad.” - AFP
