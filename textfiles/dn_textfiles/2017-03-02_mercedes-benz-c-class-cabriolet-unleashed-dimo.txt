Mercedes-Benz C-Class  cabriolet unleashed by DIMO

The new C-Class Cabriolet is now available in Sri Lanka through Diesel & Motor Engineering PLC, the general distributor for Mercedes-Benz in Sri Lanka.
Whether open or closed, the Cabriolet shines with an expressive appearance and distinctive character. The Cabriolet is optionally available with the AIRCAP electric draught stop system and AIRSCARF neck-level heating - for exceptional comfort during open-top driving 365 days a year.
Efficient, powerful engines delivering between 115 and 375 kW (156 to 510 hp) and a suspension designed for dynamic performance (with optional AIRMATIC air suspension) ensure sporty, agile handling. The 9G-TRONIC automatic transmission is available for all engine variants. Also on board: proven assistance systems and state-of-the-art infotainment. As the new entry-level model into the world of Mercedes-Benz convertibles, the C-Class Cabriolet is also a consistent embodiment of the Mercedes-Benz design philosophy: sensual purity as the definition of modern luxury - hot and cool.
It exhibits independence of character with a visibly sporty expression and youthfully fresh appeal.It's tightly stretched soft top with glass window transitions harmoniously into the distinctively styled rear end, which has a highly sporty look with its wide shoulders and flat LED tail lights.
With a capacity of 360 litres (285 litres with the roof open), the boot is capable of holding an exceptional amount of luggage for a convertible, thus offering high everyday practicality.
Based on the S-Class Cabriolet, the C-Class Cabriolet soft top also meets high quality standards in terms of durability and function. It can be opened and closed in 20 seconds, and at speeds of up to 50 km/h. After opening, it folds down quietly and precisely and is stored in the soft-top compartment in the boot.
In shape and colour the cover of the soft-top compartment is an integral part of the interior, and is made of the same material as the beltline.
DIMO offers best in class service with 24 hour road-side assistance. The all new C-Class Cabriolet is now available at DIMO 800, The Mercedes-Benz Centre of Excellence to experience.
