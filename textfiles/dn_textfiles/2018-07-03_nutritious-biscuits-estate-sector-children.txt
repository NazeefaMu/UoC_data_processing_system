Nutritious biscuits for estate sector children

The Health Ministry has introduced a special variety of biscuits to improve the nutrition level of estate sector children, a Health Ministry spokesperson said.
According to the spokesperson, the highly nutritious biscuits help improve the nutrition level of estate sector children. It was revealed that the nutrition level of estate sector children is lower than the children in other parts of the country.
Health Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne handed over the biscuits to estate superintendents in the Kalutara district, recently. The biscuits are to be distributed among estate sector children between the ages of two and five, he said. Addressing the gathering at the handing over ceremony, Minister Senaratne stated that the biscuits will be given to children three times a week and they will provide the required nutrition to the children. Thriposha is being provided to pregnant and lactating mothers, free of charge to improve their nutrition level.
