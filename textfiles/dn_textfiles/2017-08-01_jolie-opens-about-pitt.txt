Jolie opens up about Pitt

After Brad Pitt talked about his split from Angelina Jolie a few months ago, the actress is also opening up. In a latest interview with Vanity Fair magazine, she said, “It’s just been the hardest time, and we’re just kind of coming up for air. (This house) is a big jump forward for us, and we’re all trying to do our best to heal as our family. Things got bad… I don’t want to use that word. Things became ‘difficult.’”
On her kids, she said, “(Our lifestyle) was not in any way negative. That was not the problem. That is and will remain one of the wonderful opportunities we are able to give our children. They’re six very strong minded, thoughtful, worldly individuals. I’m very proud of them. We are all healing from the events that led to the filing. They’re not healing from the divorce. They’re healing from life, from things in life,” reported JustJared.com.
On developing hypertension and Bell’s palsy, “I can’t tell if it’s menopause or if it’s just been the year I’ve had. Sometimes women in families put themselves last until it manifests itself in their own health. I actually feel like more of a woman because I’m being smart about my choices, and I’m putting my family first, and I’m in charge of my life and my health. I think that’s what makes a woman complete.” Agencies
