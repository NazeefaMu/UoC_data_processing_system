Parents Union of the State Medical Students waiting to meet President

The Parents Union of the State Medical Students is waiting for an appointment with President Maithripala Sirisena to discuss the issue of the Eastern University Medical Faculty, the Union’s Media Spokesperson Wasantha Alwis said.
Addressing the media in Colombo yesterday, he said the President has given several opportunities for the parents of SAITM students to hold discussions with him, and also provided scholarships and other facilities for the SAITM students to enter the Kotelawala Defence University (KDU). However, the Parents Union of the State Medical Students is still waiting for an appointment from him even after making several requests, he said.
According to Alwis, funds required for the proposed Medical Faculty at the Eastern University were received several years ago from the Kuwait Government. However, the project has not commenced yet. “Several requests were made to the President to obtain an appointment to discuss the issue, but we did not receive the opportunity yet,” he said.
“Everything has been done to ensure the welfare of the SAITM students but qualified medical students in state universities and parents still suffer because of the struggle they launched against injustice. The Law and Order Minister had broken his pledge to remove all cases filed against them. Meanwhile, efforts are being made now to sell the MBBS degree through state medical faculties for 62,500 US Dollars,” he added.
