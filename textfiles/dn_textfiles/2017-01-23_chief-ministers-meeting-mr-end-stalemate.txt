Chief Ministers meeting with MR end in stalemate

The talks between the Chief Ministers representing the SLFP and former President Mahinda Rajapaksa failed to reconcile the divided factions of the party and ended with no agreement yesterday morning.
Joint Opposition MP Mahinda Yapa Abeywardena speaking to the Daily News yesterday said the Chief Ministers’ proposals were not well received by Rajapaksa.
Chief Ministers of six Provinces met the former President at his official residence at Wijerama Mawatha, Colombo to discuss how to unite the party and take it forward. Abeywardena who participated in the meeting said the former President was clear that “peace talks” of that nature was futile at a time the leading political figures of his camp were subjected to a “political witch-hunt” and “revenge taking”.
“The Chief Ministers said they want to protect the party without letting it to be divided. They invited us to work together. Former President Rajapaksa stressed the party was not divided by him, but on the day some contested the elections with the UNP. He said by and large the accusation of dividing the party should be borne by the other group in the government,” Abeywardena explained.
The MP pointed out that any attempt to work together must be reciprocal, adding that this type of negotiations, while openly insulting the former President would not help to resolve the problems.
“We asked the Chief Ministers to dwell on these matters and come back if they wish to discuss on the future course of action,” he said.
Asked whether any arrangement with regard to the upcoming Local Government Elections was discussed, Abeywardena said there was no point in wasting time discussing about it when the government is hesitant to hold the elections. “Let the government declare the elections first, then we will talk about it,” he said.
Western Province Chief Minister Isura Devapriya speaking to the Daily News confirmed that there was no final agreement, but said the discussions would continue to reach a common ground.
“The problems faced by both factions were stated at the meeting. Many political issues were discussed and there were arguments too. We were informed of the grievances on the part of the former President’s group,” he commented.
Former President Rajapaksa speaking to the media following the meeting said there is little hope of reconciling while a group in the SLFP is working within the UNP government. “The Chief Ministers met me with the approval of President Maithripala Sirisena. We stated our stance clearly to them. However, we are open for discussions at any time,” he added.
Chief Ministers of Western, Sabaragamuwa, Central, Southern, North Western and Uva attended the meeting while North Central Province Chief Minister Peshala Jayaratne was absent. MPs Gamini Lokuge, Mahinda Yapa Abeywardena, Bandula Gunawardena, Prasanna Ranatunga and Johnston Fernando and former MP Prof. G.L. Peiris participated along with former President Rajapaksa.
