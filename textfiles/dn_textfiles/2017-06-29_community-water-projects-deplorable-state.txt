Community water projects in deplorable state

Community water projects in the Matale district launched about two decades ago are now in a deplorable state creating a water scarcity in rural areas.
During the period, nearly 50 such water projects were initiated by the government with the assistance of foreign funds.
In the beginning, the projects were monitored by local government bodies. However, at present, they have stopped monitoring the projects after handing them over to community organizations. Thereafter, poor management of the projects and financial fraud had made some water projects inactive.
Therefore, the public request the government to rectify this issue as soon as possible.
