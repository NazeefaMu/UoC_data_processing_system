With another ‘Ashes’ series commencing on Thursday we bring you a string of articles related to the time honoured series commencing today
Blood, sweat and tears,  Adelaide 1932-33

In 1930, during the Lord’s Ashes Test with Donald Bradman unbeaten overnight on 155, his second century of the series in only its second match and his fourth in six Tests against England, the Times’ cricket correspondent compared Australia’s batting phenomenon favourably to Miss Marie Tempest, a 66-year-old actress, erstwhile star of the Geisha, the Marriage of Kitty, Hay Fever and scores of other West End and Broadway hits.
“Both are so exquisitely right in the general design and in the polished execution of every detail,” he wrote. The analogy was arch but accurate – Tempest, known as “the queen of her profession” was cited to anoint Bradman the king of his at the age of 21.
At Headingley a fortnight later, on the morning after he scored 309 in a day to take him past 1,000 Test runs in his eighth match, the Times wrote in its leader column that Bradman had “pulverised the English bowling by a display of batsmanship which, for ease of scoring, combined with absolute security, was beyond all criticism”.
Cardus called him a “genius
By the end of the series, which the tourists won 2-1 to regain the Ashes, he had scored 974 runs at 139.14, a triple century, two doubles and a mere 131 at Trent Bridge in his seven innings. He left England from Tilbury on the SS Oronsay in September with the Manchester Guardian’s Neville Cardus calling him a “genius gifted with quick feet and eyes, with mercurial spirits and all the rapid and powerful strokes of cricket” who had managed to “expel from him all the greenness and impetuosity of youth while retaining the strength and alacrity of youth”.
A man of Bradman’s peerless talent commanded admiration and respect, but Cardus, never bashful about declaring his devotion, held back on the affection. There was something about Bradman’s pitiless appetite for dominating bowlers and his innate modesty and reserve. Whatever charisma he possessed came from his actions rather than his bearing or words, and his lack of orthodox magnetism endowed his image among England’s cricketers with a severity perhaps unwarranted by his personality.
Bradman’s confidence was not cockiness and his coy grin at reaching a milestone was not insincere, yet Douglas Jardine, the man appointed to captain MCC on the 1932-33 tour of Australia and New Zealand, saw the earnestness as much as the excellence as falsehoods his patriotic duty compelled him to expose. He identified Bradman as a sadist and bully who was too good to be true.
The imperial ruling class, and particularly Wykehamists of Jardine’s ilk, believed challenges had to be confronted and by rule of force if victory depended on it. If you deem that defeat is dishonour and the foot-sore, servile role Bradman had forced you to play demeaned you further, small wonder “by any means necessary” becomes your doctrine. Build a grim bogeyman comprised of huge numbers, depersonalise him further by referring to him as “the little bastard” and you equip your team with a cause. Now all you need is a strategy, one that was likely to be brutal, cynical and ugly, given the opponent’s apparent infallibility, and the dispassion to implement it. Jardine had missed the entire 1930 Ashes series because of business commitments, but had played all five Tests under Percy Chapman in 1928-29, during which his demeanour and cautious batting had inspired the crowds to barrack him. He had captained England in three Tests against New Zealand in 1931 and against India in 1932’s solitary home match. Sitting in a darkened room at Lord’s preparing for the tour, Jardine watched short clips of newsreel footage of Bradman in 1930 and, while studying his 232 at The Oval, was galvanised when he saw the batsman cringing with pain after being struck on the sternum. The ball, delivered by England’s fastest bowler, Harold Larwood, had lifted alarmingly off a pitch given some welcome zip by a brisk shower and forced Bradman to try to retreat down the legside.
Duncan Hamilton, in his superb biography of Larwood, calls this Jardine’s “Eureka moment” and the sliver of evidence convicted Bradman of cowardice in the England captain’s eyes. Furthermore, since Bradman seldom hit the ball in the air, if you attacked his body where you perceived his sole flaw to be, testing his courage by bowling short, you also gained the advantage of restricting his scoring opportunities. For a man whose supreme gift, or at least primus inter pares, was his dazzling footwork, this was also a way to pin him on the back foot.
On the 1911-12 tour, England’s Frank Foster had targeted Australian thighs and leg stumps with vicious inswingers, and a dozen years later South Australia had packed the legside ring at the Adelaide Oval for a barrage of bumpers propelled by Lance Gun at New South Wales. Jardine did not devise leg theory, the innovation on the 1932-33 tour was its application systematically and with persistence by an imperturbable captain.
In Larwood, Bill Voce and Bill Bowes, he had strong, accurate, implacable, professional and ultimately obedient bowlers. The first two were under the guidance of Jardine’s friend, the Nottinghamshire and former England captain, Arthur Carr, and they experimented with it at the tail-end of the domestic season and, intermittently, in the six matches played between docking in Perth and the first Test at the SCG.
Bradman played in three of those matches for two Australian XI sides and NSW, scoring 3, 10, 36, 13, 18 and 23. In the two years between Ashes series he had appeared in 10 Tests, five each against West Indies and South Africa, scoring 1,253 runs and making three more double centuries, but by the beginning of his third rubber against England he was in dispute with the board over his employment as a newspaper columnist and carried the burden of being not so much a national figurehead as a beacon of Australian exceptionalism, a symbol of hope during the depths of a depression that had seen unemployment hit 28%.
Bradman’s achievements lifted Australia’s brow
Economic defeat cannot be salvaged by victory in sport, but Bradman’s achievements lifted Australia’s brow. Not least among his triumphs was his equanimity despite the expectation invested in him, the pride of a people that depended on his deeds, but in the buildup to the first Test and under England’s sporadic use of Jardine’s counterstrategy, specifically in the second of those matches, his form wobbled.
He missed the first Test on doctor’s orders, diagnosed with exhaustion, though Jardine was convinced Bradman had cracked. Proving that leg theory was as much a psychological weapon as a tactical one, Jardine persevered with his plan despite the absence of the man with the metaphorical bullseye on his heart. Stan McCabe scored 187, arguably the greatest Ashes innings, despite being repeatedly peppered on the thigh and hip, but Larwood’s two five-fors, his second by sticking rigidly to the legside attack, won England the match. In the Melbourne Herald’s dispatch from the first day’s play, the term “bodyline” was used to describe the strategy and, though many others were coined – “torso bowling” by the journalist EHD Sewell, “leg-slinging” by Cardus and even “header bowling” – none stuck so enduringly, much to the displeasure of Jardine and Larwood.
Bradman returned for the second Test at the MCG and was greeted rapturously by the crowd and, eventually, by a field of three leg slips, two leg gulleys, forward short leg, long leg and a mid on. He was out first ball in the first innings, Bowes getting lucky when his confidence trick went horribly wrong and gloriously right. Bradman, expecting a bouncer, was already committed to hooking and bottom-edged Bowes’s long hop on to his stumps. Bowes was flabbergasted. “Well, I’ll be fucked,” he said, while Jardine, uncharacteristically, danced a Rumpelstiltskin jig.
In the second innings, Bradman made 103 not out in Australia’s 191, hitting only seven fours but batting magnificently, scoring prodigiously between mid-on and square leg and taking runs from every part of the field.
Play was suspended for several minutes by applause when he reached his hundred and on the fourth day Bill O’Reilly levelled the series by taking five for 66 to complement his five for 63 in England’s first knock.
There had been jeering when Australia’s players had been hit at the MCG and condemnation of Jardine, Larwood, Voce and Bowes in the press. Jardine had only fuelled resentment by expelling the public from net practice before the third Test when he had been heckled throughout the first session as “fucking Sardine” and the air of naked hostility on the first morning at the Adelaide Oval was so palpable that mounted police had been summoned to patrol outside the turnstiles. England won the toss and batted, making 341 in a day and a half before Australia’s openers Jack Fingleton and the captain, Bill Woodfull, began the reply. Fingleton was dismissed by Gubby Allen after five minutes and then the sixth ball of Larwood’s second over, bowled to an orthodox field, skimmed up and hit Woodfull, who had taken no evasive action and had barely straightened his back out of his stance, on his left breast.
The captain put both hands to his heart, and opened his shirt to reveal a livid mark on top of an existing bruise received when struck on the same spot six weeks earlier.
The whistling and booing, under the cover of which Jardine had shouted “well bowled Harold” to faze Bradman at the non-striker’s end, took more than three minutes to die down. The guilty ball had not been fathered by leg theory but it was routinely assumed to be its bastard son.
Larwood and Jardine would die believing that Woodfull hammed up his old soldier routine to use the crowd to intimidate them, but the England captain, by his next move, was surely the architect of his own demonisation. When the opener was ready to resume and the bowler tearing in for the seventh ball of the over, Jardine stopped play. He clapped his hands and summoned his fielders into the leg trap. Eighty years on, it seems an act of villainy so grossly theatrical and corny that it bordered on the preposterous, yet Jardine was serious, identifying it as the very moment to move in for the kill and Larwood obliged by knocking Woodfull’s bat out of his hands. The jeering grew ever shriller.
Woodfull, a model of wounded valour, dug in for more than an hour and was the fourth man out after Bradman and McCabe had joined Fingleton back in the hutch. Shortly after he arrived there, MCC’s joint tour managers, Richard Palairet, the secretary of Surrey, and Pelham Warner, grand panjandrum of the most exclusive tartan, formerly of Rugby, Oxford, Middlesex and England and in 1933 the chairman of selectors and cricket correspondent of the Morning Post, invited themselves into the Australian dressing room to commiserate with him.
Rage against the “maniac”
Warner attempted to be emollient, to intimate his sympathy without daring to be explicit, the refuge of the perennial survivor who uses the defence of powerlessness to intervene then rages against the “maniac” in charge when he’s safely been dispatched. The pained expression is designed to say “I’m on your side”, even if the words never do. Woodfull refused to play that game. “I don’t want to see you, Mr Warner,” he said. “There are two teams out there. One is trying to play cricket and the other is not.”
Warner scuttled away and was later found weeping in his hotel room. For a man who considered himself a Corinthian and, above all, a gentleman, Woodfull’s words impugned his self-regard as an honourable man to whom sportsmanship, or at least the appearance of being a good sport, was sacred. To Australians then, and to our tastes now, he may seem supercilious, vain and hypocritical, but it is important to understand how trenchant the criticism was, akin to a guest at White’s accusing a member of not paying his gambling debts. Duels had been fought over less at the beginning of the previous century.
Woodfull, who had been staunchly opposed to retaliating by bowling at the Englishmen’s bodies, despite the urging of his vice-captain, Vic Richardson, still managed to land the most stinging blow of the series. He and his players may have winced when hit, the MCC’s joint tour manager was reduced to tears by three sentences.
When the snub was reported the next morning – Warner blamed Fingleton, the opener maintained Bradman was the source of the leak – the crowd’s fury now had a vigour imbued by righteousness. The tinder could not have been more susceptible to a spark and though the ball that knocked Bert Oldfield off his feet and fractured his skull had pitched wide of off-stump and without the leg trap in place, it has become Bodyline’s defining motif. Oldfield, who had been scoring runs through midwicket, top-edged his pull and said while lying on the ground in response to Larwood’s remorseful remarks: “It was my fault, Harold. I was trying to hook you for four.”
Little good it did the England team, who feared for their safety, and when Woodfull strode across the field in his suit to comfort Oldfield, they genuinely felt they would be lynched. Perhaps in Sydney or Melbourne they might have been, but the crowd stayed behind the fence, confining its anger to verbal abuse, ferocious hissing and bellicose postures. Oldfield retired hurt, missed the second innings and the next Test, and, when play resumed, England eventually won by 338 runs, by which point the drama in committee rooms on two continents overshadowed the performances of the players.
Woodfull’s words, and his actions when running to the aid of his stricken team-mate, prompted his board to send a cable to Lord’s on the fifth day of the Test and circulate it to the press.
“Bodyline bowling,” it said, “has assumed such proportions as to menace the best interests of the game, making protection of the body by the batsmen the main consideration. This is causing intensely bitter feeling between players as well as injury. In our opinion, it is unsportsmanlike. Unless stopped at once, it is likely to upset the friendly relations existing between Australia and England.”
“Unsportsmanlike”
It went from “not cricket” to “unsportsmanlike” in three days, an escalation in the arms race designed to provoke a response, but the reply it elicited five days later was a firm slap-down, couched in the withering wolf-in-sheep’s clothing language of diplomacy.
“We deprecate your opinion that there has been unsportsmanlike play,” MCC said. As Hamilton notes, without having seen it in action and relying largely on the laudatory reports in the English press, how could MCC condemn it even if its dignity could allow the ACB to lecture HQ in such a public forum? “If you consider it desirable to cancel remainder of the programme,” it continued, “we would consent, but reluctantly.” By the beginning of February, having weighed the financial implications of cancelling the tour, both for the board and the possible repercussions for Australian exports throughout the Empire, the ACB conceded: “We do not regard the sportsmanship of your team to be in question.”
There have been scores of books on the subject, millions of words, documentaries and, famously, a histrionic and occasionally camp mini-series. Whether Jardine was amoral or immoral has been debated for 80 years, yet the same conclusion is commonly reached.
He played within the laws of the game as they then existed and a concept as nebulous as the game’s spirit never troubled his conscience. Victory at all costs became another’s rallying cry seven years later, and neither Jardine nor Larwood would need to be told that it would take blood, toil, tears and sweat to achieve.
