Vigneswaran appeals to President on behalf of Vavuniya hunger strikers

 
An appeal signed by Northern Provincial Chief Minister C.V. Vigneswaran on behalf of the hunger strikers in Vavuniya was submitted to President Sirisena yesterday (25).
Residents in Vavuniya have been carrying out a hunger strike for the past few days, demanding to restore their missing family members from the civil war.
In his letter, the Northern Provincial Chief Minister stated his concern over the strikers by saying “fasting individuals are weak and old”. 
Furthermore the Chief Minister had made four suggestions on ways to act toward the protestors.
Some of the suggestions listed are to direct a Senior Minister to visit the hunger strikers, to pronounce a definite time frame to ascertain missing person’s whereabouts and to release political prisoners.
The Minister had also requested President Sirisena to take necessary measures to relocate the rightful owners of the Keppapulavu land which was released by the Army yesterday.
The Minister ended the letter by urging the President “to make note of their feelings not only for political reasons but also for ethical and humanitarian reasons”.
The letter is reproduced below:
