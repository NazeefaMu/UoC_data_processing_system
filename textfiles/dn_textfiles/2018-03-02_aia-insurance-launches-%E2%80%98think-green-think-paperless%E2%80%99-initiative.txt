AIA Insurance launches ‘Think Green,  Think Paperless’ initiative

AIA has launched the ‘Think Green, Think Paperless’ initiative, to reduce the company’s carbon footprint while also encouraging customers to save paper. AIA Insurance actively promotes green initiatives through corporate social responsibility efforts.
AIA’s Director of Operations Kelum Senanayake stated “We have prioritized going paperless so that we can contribute towards the preservation of the environment. We also understand from customer research that our customers prefer SMS communications as they find it faster and more convenient. We believe that going paperless will not only benefit the environment but will also benefit the customer.” 
He added, “The paperless initiative is intended at moving away from cumbersome processes that require you to store piles of paper which can be rather tedious. We have adopted best practices in going paperless and have the most integral and secure processes to ensure customer data protection while increasing the overall efficiency of processes. Moving away from reliance on paper is an AIA Group priority and we look forward to implementing this in Sri Lanka.”
With this initiative all AIA customers will receive a SMS with a summary of their payment receipts and other communications. This SMS will also include a personalized link through which they can view further details, download or print an electronic version of letters and notices.
