‘Sajith must be UNP candidate for premiership at general election’

The UNP Central Working Committee should nominate UNP Deputy Leader Sajith Premadasa unanimously as the UNP candidate for the Prime Minster at the general election if the UNP needs to win this time, former Deputy Minister Ashok Abeysinghe said.
“If the UNP presents former Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe this time as its candidate for Premier, it will record a sure defeat in the forthcoming general election,” he said.
He said he told the UNP Central Committee members in 2010 that Sajith Premadasa was the most suitable UNP candidate for the Premiership.
“We are now ready for the general election after the judgment of the Supreme Court. Ranil Wickremesinghe has been functioning as leader of the UNP for over 25 years. The UNP needs a reform and a change in its leadership to win elections. Therefore, he should give the leadership to Sajith,” he said.
