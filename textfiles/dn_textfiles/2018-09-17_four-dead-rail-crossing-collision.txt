Four dead at rail crossing collision

Four people died and two injured when a nano cab with eight passengers collided with the Matara bound weekend express train from Kankesanturai, at a level crossing at Omanthai around 10.30 a.m yesterday.
Two injured passengers were admitted to the Vavuniya General Hospital. One is said to be in a critical condition.
According to Police, the cab is said to have stopped on the rail track on seeing the approaching train. The cab driver and another passenger managed to escape before the collision.
The deceased are Kamalanadan Shiwaranjani (30), Kandeepan Yamuna Ranjani (32), Kandeepan Dishalani (13) and Izei Gnanawathi Yogaratnam (56). Except Shiwaranjani, the other three are residents of Delft. Shiwaranjani was a resident of Sweden.
Three persons are receiving treatment at the Vavuniya Hospital including the car driver and husband of deceased Swedish resident and their daughter. They are James Kamalanadan (34) Kamalanadhan Jesika (6) and driver Muttaiah Reddiyar.
They were visiting a relative’s house in the Omanthai in a car hired from Killinochchi. Meanwhile, residents of the area claimed that although, they had requested the authorities to set up a rail gate with permanent gatekeepers at this unprotected level crossing, their requests have so far been to no avail.
