Citizens' Mail

Why not a ‘Nagara Peraliya’
In the city of Colombo on every road, street, lane or passage the following are never removed.
 CTB season ticket issuing rusty shelters that are abandoned.
 CEB area power supplying unused steel compartments.
 Unused SLT concrete posts lying idle.
 CMC steel lamp posts that are being unused and corroded at the base. Wherever projects or repairs were done, specially on roads and pavements, debris, unused materials etc. not being removed. Over- grown trees are not trimmed and tree trunks have not been removed.
Residents collecting debris and other waste products near their homes have not been cleared. Broken, rusty, dismantled bikes, three-wheelers, cars and even lorries being parked near houses. Unused and abandoned ‘business carts’ blocking the pavements with no trace of the owners.
And so many other eye-sores like blocked roadside drains etc.
The simple question I would wish to ask is as to whose responsibility it is to look into these things? I don't think Mayors and Commissioners would have ever thought it to be their part of duty. May be they would have assumed that the five District Offices with a few engineers to each office handling their part of duty would attend to the necessities of Colombo city. These engineers do not care at all to see at least the basic requirement of repairing the pot-holes, pavements and street lamps are done in the areas allocated to them. Since the demise of President Premadasa, the sad plight of the CMC continues.
Now the members of the CMC have increased manifold. Enjoying everything on our tax contribution. No fuss! Why cannot groups of members join together and attend to the above mentioned shortcomings with the support of the area people and of those who walked behind them during the canvassing period. Cannot a name like ‘Nagara Peraliya’ be introduced to improve the Colombo city also?
