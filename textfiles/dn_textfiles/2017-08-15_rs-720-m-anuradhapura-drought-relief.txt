Rs. 720 m to Anuradhapura for drought-relief

President Maithripala Sirisena has instructed Anuradhapura government agents to take prompt action to distribute dry food rations to the drought-affected farmer families.
The President during his Anuradhapura visit recently, gathered firsthand information about the drought situation.
Rs. 720 million is to be provided to grant drought relief food rations in the Anuradhapura district. Anuradhapura government agent R. M. Wanninayaka told the Daily News that the first phase of the ‘food aid for work’ programme would commence in Thalawa and Kahatagasdigiliya DS divisions. Each drought-hit family would get food rations worth Rs. 5,000 including sugar, dhal, cowpea, wheat flower, green gram, garlic, canned fish, big onion and potatoes.
He said under the programme, a recipient was expected to work five days per month at a worksite as directed and food relief would be granted twice a month.
The food relief recipients are to engage in the renovation of rural tanks, irrigation canal systems, agriculture roads, cleaning of rural public building premises etc for a few hours in the morning.
Wanninayaka requested others not receiving food relief, to inform the Grama Niladhari or the relevant Divisional Secretary about it.
