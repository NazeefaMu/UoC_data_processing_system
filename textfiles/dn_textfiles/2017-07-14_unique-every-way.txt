Unique in every way!

At Trinity College ethics are taken very seriously. Indeed inculcating moral values is considered as one of the goals of practising drama at Trinity College. Dramatic Moves features the thespians of Trinity College, who value wit and proper conduct.
The Trinity College Literary Association, founded on March 19, 1875 by Andrew Loos, is the oldest society in school. The Drama Society is a segment of the TCLA. So to this date the TCLA is more than 140 years.
Master in Charge of Drama, Aslam Marika, highlighted how drama contributes to intellect.
“Drama is everything about soft skills. I think when it comes to drama the boys have acquired good moral values. That is what we try to inculcate in the students doing drama. Our Principal Andrew Fowler Watt is a drama enthusiast. He did drama while he was in England. He is very conscious of getting more students involved in theater. We had a wonderful inter-house drama competition. The students passionately practicsd with wonderful props and costumes,” said Marika.
Marika believes that the drama circuit as a whole is very challenging.
“A lot of schools put in a lot of hard work to stage their productions. It is a good festive experience when you go to Colombo. We do enjoy ourselves. We have good memories of going down to Colombo. That is one of the plus sides to theater and traveling down to Colombo. It is a wonderful experience.”
“One aspect of drama is that there is a collision between good and bad. It is an opinion of good and bad always colliding. By doing different dramas, the boys are open to different aspects of how people perceive good and bad. It expands your intellect. It is easy to get things done with these boys because they are passionate and enthusiastic with what they want to do,” stated Marika.
Meeting new people
President of the Trinity College Literary Association – 2016, Shalitha Seneviratne feels Trinity have a pool of young talent which is very encouraging.
“At the moment one of our strengths is our juniors. They are a young batch of actors who are being molded in the Middle School. We have seniors, even though they have left school they are still strength to us. Prior to the competition they help us with the directing and choreography. There are even seniors doing their A/L’s, who take their time to participate in competitions,” said Seneviratne.
Seeing as to what is happening at the moment with the juniors stepping in, he feels drama at Trinity will continue to flourish.
“Because like what Mr. Marikar said, the Principal is also focused on drama and we are having more competitions within school and we have identified new talent and we definitely have the potential to move forwards.
Doing drama is a wonderful experience. For me it was an experience that holds lot memories. Coming to the end of my school career I have done seven dramas and all seven dramas have stood out. When it comes to doing dramas you meet new people and you get this whole new experience and exposure. When you do drama you learn to go beyond what you can do. You improve the talent you have within you. When you do drama it unlocks a lot more than what you think you can do, so I would definitely encourage anyone to do drama. You will find a lot of friends. That experience will last a lifetime, so if you want that experience I would say do drama,” explained Seneviratne.
Brotherhood
Treasurer of the Trinity College Literary Association - 2016, Manula Dissanayake spoke of the bond created between the boys.
“When we get together to do drama and when we get to know each other, a special bond is created between us. Like a brotherhood. We start to understand each other. I think that is one of the main strengths we have. We do a lot of comedies and tragedies. But we are more understanding of the tragedies. We do much better in tragedies. Comedies is a bit hard when it comes to making a person laugh. When it comes to tragedies we tend to understand more of the play. So we do well in tragedies,” said Dissanayake.
Drama teaches you moral ethics.
“Through drama we find different characters. While acting we explore them. We debate on their actions. In that way we gain a greater understanding of society. It also give us discipline. To do drama you need a great deal of discipline. It also challenges our memory power, because when we memorize lines we need to do it in a short time. In an overall way it builds the character of a person. And this is vital when we go out into the society. It teaches us to work together,” explained Dissanayake.
“When it comes to playing a female character, we are not women! But what we can do is, get to know about the character and that can be the foundation and then you need to get in touch with your feminine side. If you are in touch with that, you can develop your character. Then you can go a long way,” pointed out Dissanayake.
A challenge
Secretary of the Trinity College Literary Association – 2017, Bilaal Marikar, felt that by doing drama you will not be disappointed and there is so much to be gained.
“There are many juniors and seniors who are quite enthusiastic and they also work to develop their specific talents in drama. Recently we had the inter-school drama competition. We saw a huge pool of students come every day for practices, and they keep developing themselves. They are a very enthusiastic bunch of young people,” said Marikar.
Definitely drama has prepared these boys to go out into the world.
“As Mr. Marikar said it instills many moral values in yourself which prepares you to go out into the world. Because when you do drama it is not just going out there and acting on stage. It gives you much more than that.
I think when it comes to challenges one of the challenges might be going for competitions in the middle of examinations. Because sometimes the students find it hard to balance both activities. For me that has been quite a challenge but I manage to do both properly,” stated Marikar.
Being able to perceive behavior traits in people can be gained by portraying characters.
“Whenever I play a character I do a thorough background check, so I can actually get into his skin. For example the reasons behind his actions and why he is taking them? What has affected him in the past to do what he is doing? So that way it is easier for me to get into the character because I understand the character more. You also need to explore the society around him as well.
By exploring the minds of people, it prepares you for society, because you get a better understanding of why people behave the way they do and what challenges people might be facing. The values you have gained doing drama will never leave you and you can take it with you when you leave school,” elucidated Marikar.
Having fun
Coordinator of the Trinity College Literary Association – 2016, Tishan Kularatne felt that every play has been equally special.
“Considering the plays that we have performed over the years, I can’t specifically point out a most memorable one, because actually the whole point of drama is having fun and getting that exposure and experience. It is basically the festivity of it. It is an all-round molding of ones’ character.
When you think of all the Shakespeare Dramas that we have performed, each one has been quite memorable and every play has had its uniqueness. In my point of view there is no specific unforgettable drama. Everything has been really good.
Every drama that we have performed is a challenge. We try our best to always analyze the character and get into character. We try to get the maximum out of ourselves so the play can take place in a proper manner. Every play poses a new challenge. There is a huge difference between a tragedy and a comedy. So I will not be able to point out a specific hard play because every play has its own challenges,” explained Kularatne.
He feels that his personal favorite from the Shakespearean plays he has done is that of Sir Toby from Twelfth Night. The specific scene where he is intoxicated having consumed alcohol is challenging, because to portray someone when you are not drunk and intoxicated is a challenge.
“When it comes to chemistry between the boys, starting is the hard part. We know some people and we don’t know some people. As the play goes on, we get to know people on a personal basis. We get to know their personalities. And we connect through the play. By the end of the drama we are one big family. There is a unique bond of brotherhood,” added Kularatne.
