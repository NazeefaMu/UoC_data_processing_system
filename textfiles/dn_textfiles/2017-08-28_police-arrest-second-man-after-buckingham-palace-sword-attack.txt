Police arrest second man after Buckingham Palace sword attack

UK: Three unarmed cops were injured as they incapacitated the 26-year-old attacker, who was repeatedly yelling "Allahu Akbar", with CS spray outside the royal residence on The Mall on Friday night.
The suspect, from Luton, has been arrested under the terrorism act following the rampage at the palace - and cops have been given more time to question him.
Police arrested a second man - a 30-year-old - after raiding an address in West London this morning. The suspect was arrested on suspicion of being involved in the commission, preparation or instigation of terrorism and is currently in custody.
Police have said the 26-year-old attacker in a blue Toyota Prius "reached for a 4ft sword" in front of terrified tourists as three heroic unarmed cops rushed to tackle him.
At least six ambulances and police cars were seen rushing towards the London landmark as dozens of uniformed police pushed back tourists just after 8.30pm.Two of the officers were taken by ambulance to hospital with minor cuts and discharged a short time later.
The third officer did not require hospital treatment.Police blocked off all entrances to the palace, which was not occupied by The Queen, who is in Scotland, last night.
Witness Emma Bell, 28, said of the terrorist: “There was blood all over his face and his shirt.
I don’t know if the blood was his or from the police. I was scared.
"We didn’t know if there were other terrorists. An officer said calmly, ‘You need to get out of here.’”Commander Dean Haydon, the head of the Met’s Counter Terrorism Command, said: “I would like to pay tribute to the bravery and professionalism of these officers who quickly brought this incident under control.
"Their vigilance, courage and the swiftness of their response demonstrates how our officers are protecting the public at this time.
“Officers from the Counter Terrorism Command are now investigating and searches are being carried out in the Luton area today.
“We believe the man was acting alone and we are not looking for other suspects at this stage."While we cannot speculate on what the man was intending to do - this will be determined during the course of the investigation - it is only right that we investigate this as a terrorist incident at this time.
The maniac is said to have been seen driving erratically before coming to a halt near a police car and lunging at officers with the blade.An onlooker said: "He hit a bollard and got out with a machete."
Pictures on social media showed a police cordon surrounding the top of The Mall in central London with forensic teams working next to the Queen Victoria Memorial.A witness said: “The officers wrestled a man from a car who looked like he was driving his vehicle towards them.
“The scuffle took place and he was dragged out the car brandishing a knife, which cut the police tying to detain him.” - THE SUN
