DMM urged to launch drought relief programme in A’pura

Anuradhapura District Secretary R.M Wanninayaka has urged the Disaster Management Ministry (DMM) to launch a drought relief programme in the Anuradhapura district.
He requested the ministry to allocate funds and implement a food supply drive to help the drought affected.
Wanninayaka said 124,500 people in the district have been affected by the drought. He said the 2017 Yala season has been a failure. In some areas in the district such as Mahavilachchiya, Mahakandarawa, Rambeewa and Mihintale, farmers have been unable to cultivate in three seasons due to the lack of water, he said.
