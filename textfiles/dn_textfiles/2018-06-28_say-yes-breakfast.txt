Say yes to breakfast

Eating breakfast will give your child energy and get his/her metabolism started. It will help the body use the food he/she eats more efficiently throughout the day. After a night without food, your body does not have the energy it needs. This is why we need a top-up before we tackle the day. Try these tasty and healthy breakfast ideas to get your child to eat this important morning meal. You can also get your child’s help to prepare their own breakfast.
