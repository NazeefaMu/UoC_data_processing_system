Strike to continue despite of talks

 
The Railway Trade Unions said that the railway strike will continue despite of holding talks with the Secretary to the President, today, in Colombo.
Trains beginning from Colombo Fort and Maradana were cancelled due to the strike yesterday, causing inconvenience to daily commuters.
The Railway Trade Unions said that the strike was launched in protest of issues relating to recruiting engine driver assistants.
