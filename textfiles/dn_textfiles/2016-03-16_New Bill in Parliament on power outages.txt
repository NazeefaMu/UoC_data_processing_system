New Bill in Parliament on power outages

A new Bill holding engineers and related officials responsible for any power failure in the country will be introduced to Parliament soon. The decision comes in the wake of the continued power cuts experienced across the island.
The absence of any one person to take responsibility for the failure led to the move to introduce a Bill that will hold engineers and officials responsible for power supply responsibly or for any power outage.
