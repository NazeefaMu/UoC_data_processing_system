Welikada massacre penned down

Kasun Pusswaella, a journalist who extensively covered the massacre of 27 prisoners at the Welikada prison in 2012, will launch a book '12-11-10 Welikada' on September 15 at the Mahaweli Centre, Colombo.
A riot in the Welikada prison led to the murders on November 9, 2009 and the massacre continued till morning. Pussawella, an award winning journalist attached to the Ravaya newspaper and thereafter the Irudina newspaper, extensively wrote about the alleged murders in both newspapers.
A public petition will be signed at the venue following the book launch.
