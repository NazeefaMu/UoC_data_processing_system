Minister Ajith challenges Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe to refrain from spreading falsehoods

Power and Renewable Energy Deputy Minister Ajith P. Perera yesterday challenged former Minister Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe to refrain from spreading falsehoods to cover up the truth behind his removal from his Ministerial position.
Deputy Minister Perera pointed out that former Minister Rajapakshe failed to fulfill the promises relating to fighting corruption included in the UNP election manifesto, ‘A New Country in 60 Months’.
Perera also alleged that Rajapaksa failed to improve the efficiency of the Attorney General which was under his purview.
Deputy Minister Perera was addressing a special press conference at the Power and Renewable Energy Ministry premises yesterday evening.
The Minister also commented on a statement made by former minister Rajapakshe who said that he was ashamed to have belonged to the present Cabinet. Perera wondered why Rajapakshe waited until he was removed from his position to feel ashamed about the Cabinet.
The Deputy Minister also pointed out, if Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe was to resign in shame, it should have been when he made an irresponsible comment on the Hambantota Port agreement or when the UNP Working Committee questioned his conduct.
Deputy Minister Perera further pointed out if Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe was really ashamed to be a part of the Cabinet, he should have willingly stepped down from his post without waiting till his removal. Perera also said that he has no personal vendetta against Rajapakshe, but was critical of his conduct taking the country's interest at heart.
Deputy Minister Ajit P. Perera refuted Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe's allegation that the Attorney General was reprimanded at Temple Trees regarding the investigations relating to the Treasury bond issue.
Perera highlighted that no UNP Minister or an MP have ever accused the Attorney General at Temple Trees. He also said Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe has no corruption allegations in relation to the Treasury bond issue.
According to Perera, Rajapakshe has told media that while he (Rajapakshe) is the Justice Minister, the Attorney General will not be allowed to file a case against the suspects connected to the Treasury bond issue, after the report of the Presidential Commission of Inquiry investigating into the case is out.
Deputy Minister Perera also said he is not interested at all in taking up responsibility as the new Minister of Justice.
