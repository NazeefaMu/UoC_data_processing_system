Regulating private hospitals to commence shortly

Minister Dr. Senaratne said regulating private hospitals will commence after studying the report and formulating a plan and a system. The state rural hospital network will also be developed. He expressed those views addressing the gathering after handing over awards to hospital staff of the Ampara General Hospital during a ceremony held recently.
According to Minister Senaratne, he had opened seven development projects at the Ampara General hospital completed at a cost of Rs. 300 million. More medical faculties will be set up in future and medical education will be given through both state and private medical colleges.
He pointed out that some who took part in the January 8 revolution and who did not take part in it cannot understand what Good Governance is. The Northern people did not receive any relief. Demands of trade unions will be met and the free health service will be protected, he added.
