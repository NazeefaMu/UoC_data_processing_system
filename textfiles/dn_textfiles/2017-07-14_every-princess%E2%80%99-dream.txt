Every Princess’ Dream

Three years ago she crossed the Atlantic with a broken heart. Her relationship with ex-fiancé and boyfriend of eight years had come to an end amidst claims that he had cheated on her. Needing time to get herself back together she flew to New York in search of 'peace and quiet.' And promptly fell into the arms of the man who would, in the months to come, completely heal her broken heart.
As the old saying goes, you have to kiss a few frogs before you find Prince Charming. This was so for Princess Madeleine, the younger daughter of King Carl and Queen Silvia of Sweden. After some hard knocks on the path to true love, she found her dream husband in Chris O'Neill, a 36-year-old millionaire who makes a living dishing out financial advice to super-wealthy clients and who bears more than a passing resemblance to her former finance.
Chris is the son of socialite Eva O'Neill who reportedly once dated Prince Charles and made a splash in 2003 when she invited the future King to a celebration of Mozart's music, and greeted him with a kiss – a gesture which was captured by the British press and witnessed by Camilla, who also attended the event.
How does he fit into the Royal Family? Perfectly, it seems. According to Madeleine's mother, Queen Silvia Chris is "every mother-in-law's dream". This glowing review from the Queen comes courtesy of his gallant behaviour – and his glittering society credentials. And his kindness and his sensitive ways.
He was overcome with emotion and struggled to hold back tears as he waited at the altar, at the Chapel of the Royal Palace of Stockholm, on 8th June 2013, watching his beautiful bride glide towards him accompanied by her proud father King Carl XVI Gustaf.
Princess Madeleine looked breathtakingly beautiful in a pleated organza gown with ivory-coloured Chantilly lace detailing by Valentino. The bridal bouquet that Madeleine carried consisted of classic white garden roses: Austin roses, Winchester Cathedral and Alabaster, as well as lilies of the valley. All the flowers were white, and the bouquet was tied into a round shape. Her dazzling tiara was softened with sprigs of orange blossom, in harmony with the ceremony's summer meadow theme, which was evident in the chapel's beautiful floral decorations as well. Adorning the chapel were beech leaves, cow parsley, pink and white peonies, white lilacs, foxgloves, and lilies of the valley, all in keeping with the pale pink, green and white colour scheme, inspired by the natural beauty of the early summer in Sweden.
Seen as Sweden's answer to William and Kate's royal romance, many European royals were present at the wedding to witness the couple's vows with the minister addressing Madeleine by her full name, Madeleine Thérèse Amelie Josephine, and Chris as Christopher Paul O'Neill. The couple looked intently into one another's eyes and exchanged smiles as they made history in becoming man and wife.
While his efforts to learn Swedish lead us to understand why the queen would call him "every mother-in-law's dream" after he placed a stunning diamond ring on Madeleine's finger, that accolade no doubt, extended to include every princess' dream.
As Jenny Alexandersson, the royal reporter at Swedish tabloid Aftonbladet, said, the breakup with her boyfriend had been 'really, really hard' for Madeleine. “She was really sad...this time I hope it's a big love. They look really, really happy together so I'm crossing my fingers for them.'
