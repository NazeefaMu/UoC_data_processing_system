The Science, Technology and Research Ministry has taken measures to grant financial aid to new inventors to commercialize their products under the ‘Nawa Nipayum Diriya’ Grant Scheme Programme.
A ceremony to hand over financial aid to five inventors was held yesterday at the Science, Technology and Research Ministry under the patronage of Science, Technology and Research Minister Susil Premajayantha.
Financial aid was handed over to Dr. Sanath Hettige who won the Presidential Award for the best medical invention in 2016 for his invention of papaya leaf syrup, tablets and capsules for the treatment of dengue fever. Kodikarage Piyasena was awarded for his invention of alternatives for polythene products using banana fiber.

Financial aid worth Rs. 9.6 million was also handed over to the Engineering Faculty of the Jaffna University for the establishment of the National Incubation Centre.
The Ministry plans to set up five National Incubation Centres in five districts and one such centre had already been established at the National Engineering Research and Development Centre. Addressing the media after handing over the financial aid, Minister Premajayantha said the Sri Lanka Inventors Commission has been mandated to grant financial aid to inventors for the commercialization process.
The Minister said the commission disburses funds through the Innovation Accelerator Funding Mechanism of Sri Lanka. The Science, Technology and Research Ministry has set up an Innovation Accelerator Funding Mechanism for Sri Lanka which will be managed and implemented by the Sri Lankan Inventors Commission (SLIC) to support Sri Lankan inventors to commercialize their inventions.
