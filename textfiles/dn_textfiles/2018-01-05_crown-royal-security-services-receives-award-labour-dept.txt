Prior to receiving this award, a team from the Labour Department visited Crown Royal Security Services for a physical inspection, said its Chairman/CEO Lt. Cdr Ajit P. Kangaraarachchi.
“They also went through the employees' salary scales and statutory payments such as EPF and ETF and also looked at bonuses that were offered to the staff.”

These include cash transportation, CCTV operations, Marine Corps Security Service (Private) Limited, Crown Support Services cleaning and janitorial, Imagination Advertising, and Sainsbury Pawning Centers.
“We have been able to build and maintain strong relationships with many leading private and public sector enterprises through the years and today our current staff strength on field is around 2,000 and 75% of the total are from ex-service personnel.”
“Today, we are also a preferred company to offer services to reputed companies like HNB, BOC, NSB, MBSL, banks and over 300 other companies to date.
