Aussie Kirk wins Thornberry Creek LPGA title

Washington,Sunday:Katherine Kirk birdied the final hole to edge Ashleigh Buhai by one stroke Sunday, claiming a third LPGA tour title at the Thornberry Creek Classic in Wisconsin.
Australia’s Kirk went into the final round with a four-shot lead over South Africa’s Buhai and had the LPGA Tour’s 72-hole scoring record in her sights.
She nabbed six birdies in a final-round 70, and while it didn’t threaten the scoring record of 27-under, her 22-under total of 266 was enough to hold off Buhai.
“To make that putt (on 18) was huge,” Kirk said. “All wins are good. Winning out here is hard, and it’s gotten a lot harder out here since I first did it, that’s for sure.
“There is so much talent out here now and it makes it so much harder to win. I think I’m the 15th-oldest player on Tour,” added the 35-year-old. “So if you’re looking at age it’s more in favour of the younger generation these days ... but hard work pays off.”
Kirk, of Brisbane, notched her first LPGA win since the 2010 Navistar LPGA Classic. She also won the 2008 Canadian Women’s Open.
She also secured a berth in the US Women’s Open that starts on Thursday at Trump National Golf Club in Bedminster, New Jersey.
Johannesburg’s Buhai rolled in the last of her five birdies in a bogey-free 67 at the 18th and finished alone in second on 267. AFP
