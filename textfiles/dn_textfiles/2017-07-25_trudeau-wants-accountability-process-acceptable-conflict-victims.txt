Trudeau wants accountability process acceptable to conflict victims

Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau yesterday reiterated the need to establish a process of accountability that will have the trust and the confidence of the victims of the North and East conflict.
Issuing a statement on the anniversary of Black July, the Canadian Prime Minister welcomed international efforts underway to achieve long term reconciliation and peace for all Sri Lankans. “As we pause to reflect on the dark days of the Sri Lankan Civil War, we must continue to work to heal the wounds of all those who suffered. Canada welcomes international efforts underway to achieve long-term reconciliation and peace for all Sri Lankans, but we reiterate the need to establish a process of accountability that will have the trust and the confidence of the victims of this war,” the Canadian Premier said. Trudeau said the anti-Tamil pogroms were carried out in Colombo and other parts of Sri Lanka resulting in thousands of deaths and the displacement of countless victims between July 24 and 29, 1983
“Canada’s cultural diversity is one of our greatest strengths and sources of pride. As we mark the 150th anniversary of Confederation, let us take the time to recognize the contributions of all who have made Canada their home regardless of their cultural, religious or linguistic background,” the statement added. - AGENCIES
