Reintroduction of death penalty greatest folly


Contemplating the reintroduction of the death penalty, the willful taking of life, thinly veiled in judicial respectability, is hideous at best. Such musings which have no place in any civilised society, are even more preposterous in a Buddhist nation that professes the sanctity of all life and abhors its wilful destruction. To present this extreme punishment as a viable deterrent to crime, in a country where political interference has destroyed any semblance of judicial independence and integrity, where there exists a de facto two-tier justice system favouring those with wealth and political power, where the instruments of law can be bought, applied and wielded at will, and where a chief justice can be arbitrarily ousted without due process, is beyond folly. The very idea, however fleetingly contemplated, is utterly deplorable and morally bankrupt.
Judicial murder can never be the answer, however heinous the crime, because we as members of civilised society should never have the power of life and death over any other human being. It is not a right we can claim through judicial ritual or by evoking eye-for-an-eye vengeance. Understanding of the sanctity of life, even the life of the most despicable and depraved, is what defines civilisation.
Buddhist teaching
A society that celebrates and revels in the achievements of its most promising, must also accept a duty of care to its most aberrant. As Sri Lankans, the detailed and profound understanding of what entails wilful and premeditated destruction of life, as articulated in Buddhist teaching - the first of the five precepts - is what defines us as a Buddhist society. Surely we cannot lay claim to any philosophical and moral superiority if we are so easily seduced by an almost primal urge for revenge. To silently condone the death penalty or openly bay for it, is to say that we as a society are willing to sully our hands with murder - judicial murder.
Justification for institutionalised murder is often presented as righteous and necessary for the protection of wider society - as the ultimate deterrent to criminal activity. But surely such justifications are spurious if they are merely based on whim, political expedience or populist belief rather than tangible evidence that proves a causal link between the death penalty and a reduction in heinous crime. The truth is, no such evidentiary link is apparent, and there is no reliable proof that such a link has ever existed. Studies on this subject bear testament to the folly that is capital punishment. Therefore if we chose to ignore this crucial fact, and forge ahead with the reintroduction of a death penalty, we must concede that our true reasoning is merely to seek retribution - a determination to kill off less desirable members or our society.
Violent retribution
As compassionate human beings who profess to cherish the virtues of metta, karuna, mudita, and upekkha, premeditated killing should be condemned not only because of the suffering of the condemned, but also, and perhaps more importantly, the suffering it inflicts upon the families of those we collectively kill.
Even if these vile offenders have had the benefit of a fair trial and are beyond our pity, surely we have no right to tell a mother, who has committed no crime, that we will take their child to the gallows and hang them because our system demands its pound of flesh. In doing this we fail her and we fail ourselves. Such barbarity is not life affirming, it only serves to cheapen human life, and strip us of our humanity.
The criminal's crimes certainly have already destroyed lives, but our violent retribution will only bring more misery and suffering to a land that has seen an unfair share of carnage.
Any decision to reintroduce the death penalty in Sri Lanka, while ultimately rubber stamped by a President and Cabinet, will in reality, be a decision made by Sri Lankans, by virtue of our action or indeed our inaction. Reintroduction of the death penalty is something each and every Sri Lankan must consider deeply.
It requires some serious soul-searching - more so for every Buddhist in the country who proclaims they live in a dharmadveepa, for where in that Buddhist philosophy or great Theravada tradition of compassion is such barbaric, premeditated judicial murder sanctioned? If we truly value Buddha's teachings rather than merely pay it lip service, then we cannot in all good conscience condone this most fundamental of breaches. What's more, we must not remain silent or indifferent. Hiding behind politics and a collective anonymity will not keep the blood from our hands. Our failure to object will make hangmen of us all.
