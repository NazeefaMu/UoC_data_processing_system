CID questions State Minister Wijayakala over alleged involvement

Main suspect's release in Vidya murder case:
The Criminal Investigation Department(CID) on Wednesday questioned Women and Child Affairs State Minister Wijayakala Maheswaran extensively over the allegations that she had aided and abetted the release of Mahalingama Shashi Kumar alias Swisss Kumar, the main suspect in the murder of Vidya Sivaloganathan.
According Police sources, Maheshwaran has arrived at the CID at around 3 p.m. on Wednesday to give a statement over her alleged involvement in the release of ‘Swiss Kumar’. Kayts Magistrate M.M.Riyal had instructed the CID to investigate how State Minister Vijayakala Maheswaran had allegedly instructed the police to release Mahalingam Shashi Kumar alias Swiss Kumar, the main suspect in the Vidya murder.
Counsel appearing for former Deputy Inspector General Lalith Jayasinghe informed court that Maheswaran arrived at the place where the main suspect was captured and tied to a electricity post by the residents.
The counsel said the State Minister had come to the scene and released him by untying him from the electricity post, without handing him over to the police.
Former Senior DIG Lalith Jayasinghe was earlier arrested on charges of aiding and abetting Kumar’s release. Sivaloganathan Vidya was abducted, gang raped and murdered in Jaffna in 2015.
