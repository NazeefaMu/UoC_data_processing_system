Hospital lacking lab assistant

Patients who attend the Kobeigane District Hospital in Kurunegala complained that there has been no lab assistant present for over one and half years. The former lab assistant went on retirement and thereafter, no replacement has been made so far.
Although many appeals were made to responsible health authorities of the North Western Province Health Ministry, no favourable steps have been so far made in the interest of low-income patients in the Kurunegala District who seek free medical services at provincial hospitals.
