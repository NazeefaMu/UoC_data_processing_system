Accelerated scheme to electrify all houses in Polonnaruwa

An accelerated domestic electricity supply scheme has been launched in the North Central Province. Under this programme every household in Polonnaruwa district will be provided with electricity by mid January.
This was revealed at a Provincial electricity supply progress review meeting held recently at the Polonnaruwa District Secretariat with North Central Province Chief Minister Peshala Jayaratne Bandara and Power and Energy Minister Ranjith Siyambalapitiya.
It was disclosed at the meeting that Rs. 8,000 million has been allocated to provide electricity to families in the North Central Province.
Minister Siyambalapitiya pointed out that since a road modernization programme was underway in the Province it was advisable to install power lines along the roads being renovated for transmitting electricity from village to village simultaneously.
The Chief Minister pointed out that there were a large number of low income group families in the province unable to meet the initial expenses to be met in getting the supply for their households. In the background the CEB agreed to grant a relief loan facility of Rs. 40,000 to a family for covering the expenditure including wiring, etc. which could be settled in installments within six years payable with the monthly electricity bill.
Minister Siyambalapitiya emphasised that the accelerated electricity supply project in Polonnaruwa shall be completed in January.
