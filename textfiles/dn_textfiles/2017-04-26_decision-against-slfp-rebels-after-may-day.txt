Decision against SLFP rebels after May Day

A decision, regarding SLFP Parliamentarians and organisers failing to attend or support the party’s May Day rally at the Getambe playground in Kandy, will be taken by the party central committee at its meeting held after May Day, said Central Province Chief Minister and Chairman of the SLFP May Day Committee Sarath Ekanayake.
He said all party members were duty-bound to join and support its May Day rally which is a major party programme and no one could shirk this duty and responsibility.
He said party supporters from all districts including those in the North and East would attend the Getambe rally which would be held in an environment-friendly manner. There would be two processions converging on Getambe playground. Participants coming from the direction of Colombo would join the procession starting from Gannoruwa and those coming from the direction of Kandy would join the procession from Peradeniya road. Members of the SLFP youth front will join the forefront of the procession from Gannoruwa and party trade unions will lead the procession coming from the direction of Kandy.
