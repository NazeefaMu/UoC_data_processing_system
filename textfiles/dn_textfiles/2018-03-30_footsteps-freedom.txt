Footsteps to Freedom

“Everyone deserves to be heard and respected,” says Kumar Sangakkara, former Sri Lankan cricket captain as he joins forces to assist fellow Lankans win the battle of life. “Improving the emotional well being of all Sri Lankans is vital.
According to sources currently eight to ten people commit suicide per day. For every one person who dies by suicide, there are many failed attempts. We should all together create awareness and prevent suicide in the country,” said Sangakkara, Ambassador of CCCline 1333.
CCCline 1333 established by the Courage Compassion Commitment (CCC) Foundation in partnership with Lifeline in Australia and the National Institute of Mental Health in Angoda, Sri Lanka aims to prevent suicide in Sri Lanka through education, engagement and empowerment to break the stigma attached to mental illness and social issues.
Since its inception in December 2009, CCCline 1333 has been steadily moving forward towards its goal of being a credible, accessible and most utilised telephone counselling service in Sri Lanka.
CCCline 1333 is a confidential and free telephone counselling service to encourage people to talk about their problems whether they are personal, relationship or family issues, schools or work worries, mental illness or suicide thoughts. CCCline’s 1333 short code number is a toll free number accessible to all people of Sri Lanka. The service currently averages over 2,000 calls every month.
CCCline 1333 Telephone Counsellors are trained under the guidance of Lifeline Australia, the largest telephone counselling service in Australia. The Telephone Counsellors provide their services in a voluntary capacity.
“At the moment CCCline 1333 operates from 9am to 9pm. We want to expand it and make it open for calls 24x7. All callers are treated with dignity and respect by the Telephone Counsellors, who listen and empower the callers to resolve their problems.
If required, callers are also referred to other related services in their local area for further support,” CCC line Manger, Ranil Tillakaratne said. To raise the needed funds CCCline 1333 will commence a walk on April 1. ‘Footsteps to Freedom’, a 44-day walk across the country, with a team of volunteers, holding workshops along the route to educate residents on mental health. This walk is a collaboration between two organisations that are doing significant work around emotional well-being and suicide prevention: CCC line 1333, which is a telephone counselling service available toll-free, and Shanthi Maargam which is an organisation that works towards the emotional well-being of the young people of Sri Lanka.
‘Out of the Shadows’, 1333 Bikeathon will also be held in August this year to create national awareness of CCCline’s 1333 toll free number in Sri Lanka and raise funds to sustain and expand its operations.
Kumar Sangakkara, ambassador of CCCline 1333 may join part of the ride in Sri Lanka depending on availability.
Apart from its CCCline 1333 Telephone Counselling Service, CCC Foundation also established and manage CCChouse, a 194 bed transit home for outpatients with cancer and their carers at the premises of the National Cancer Institute Maharagama Sri Lanka.
