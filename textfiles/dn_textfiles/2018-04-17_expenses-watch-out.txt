The COPE Reports - Part 1
Expenses to watch out for

The Government is entrusted with billions of rupees of public funds, collected from the people. It has a duty to account for them and use them in accordance with the wishes of Parliament, without excess, extravagance or waste.
Ensuring the money is properly used is the responsibility of Parliament which works through two Committees, the Committee on Public Accounts (COPA) and the Committee on Public Enterprises. COPA scrutinises the Government, its Ministries, Departments, Provincial Councils and Local Authorities while COPE scrutinises public corporations and business undertakings.
Summarised are some findings of the 1st COPE report. The COPE, by its own admission, is under-resourced. It lacks staff particularly for audit and legal support. They also lack IT systems and apparently, even a proper office.
Despite these limitations and the fact that the reports are not comprehensive-they have examined a limited number of issues in a few institutions, they are a devastating critique of the state of governance. This is only the tip of a very large iceberg and underlines the need for a drastic re-think in the role of government.
A few highlights are presented below.

Board of the Sri Jayewardenepura General Hospital
Payment of consultants’ fees
Note: Although this is a state hospital it also runs a paying ward. These payments of fees appear to be over and above the normal remuneration to staff.
1. 50% of the total income charged from the patients of the paying wards has been paid as professional fees to the doctors and staff of the hospital. PAYE tax has not been deducted from the payment. Unpaid PAYE tax for 2014 and 2015 amounted to Rs.74.7m
Purchase of anaesthetic equipment
1. Four anaesthetic machines had been purchased at a cost of Rs. 29.9m without following a proper procurement process. The purchase of the equipment had apparently gone ahead despite an offer from the Australian Government to provide these free of charge.
2. The purchase of the equipment had been justified on the basis of three existing machines being defective. No technical evaluation is available to support this and no proper procedure was followed for disposal. The Committee was later informed that the disposed of equipment had been given to the Negombo, Kalutara and Monaragala hospitals.
Expired stock
Drugs and other worth Rs.5.1m had been purchased for the Neurosurgical Unit in February 2012.
80% of the stock valued at Rs.4.1m had not been used and expired.
