Former British school chief here

Former Chief Inspector of Schools in England Sir Michael Wilshaw will speak in Sri Lanka later this month as the country moves to develop its educational infrastructure.
He will be the chief guest at the International Schools of Sri Lanka’s fifth Annual Conference, the organization announced at the Lyceum International School in Nugegoda on Wednesday.
“We are very honoured to have him with us this time,” TISSL Chairperson Kumari Grero said.
Along with Wilshaw, education experts Dr. Matthew Anderson and Dr. Mark Winterbottom too would speak on the theme of “problem solving” at the conference.
