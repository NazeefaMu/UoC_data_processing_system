Third leg of  International Yoga Day in Mannar

The celebrations of the Third International Day of Yoga was held at Mannar Urban Council Ground last week.
The event was organised by the Indian consulate in Jaffna and it was assisted by the Ministry of Education and several government and Northern Provincial Council Ministers and several business institutions in Jaffna.

 This is subsequent to the United Nations General Assembly adopted a resolution piloted by India declaring June 21 each year as the “International Day of Yoga”.
The resolution was supported by more than 170 countries, with Sri Lanka being one of the first co-sponsors of the Resolution.  Yoga is an invaluable gift of ancient Indian tradition that embodies unity of mind, body and soul.
