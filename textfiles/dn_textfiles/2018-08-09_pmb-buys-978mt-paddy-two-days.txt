PMB buys 978MT of paddy in two days

The Paddy Marketing Board (PMB) has purchased around 978 metric tonnes of paddy in two days, an Agriculture Ministry spokesman said.
At the request of Agriculture Minister Mahinda Amaraweera, the government has allocated Rs. 4.9 billion for the purchase of paddy from the Yala 2018 harvest, from farmers.
The PMB began purchasing the paddy two days ago at Kohombana in Uhana in the Ampara District.
Paddy harvesting in the Yala season of 2018 has already begun in the Eastern Province and the PMB has decided to start purchasing paddy from these farmers first. The PMB expects to purchase 120,000 metric tons of paddy from this year’s Yala harvest.
A kilogramme of nadu will be purchased at a certified price of Rs. 38, while a kilogramme of samba will be purchased at Rs. 41.
The PMB will also provide the poly-pak bags free to farmers for the packaging of paddy. Farmers do not need to present documents from the agricultural research product development assistants to prove their identity.
It has been reported that the private sector is purchasing paddy of the Yala harvest at Rs. 10 higher than the certified price.
