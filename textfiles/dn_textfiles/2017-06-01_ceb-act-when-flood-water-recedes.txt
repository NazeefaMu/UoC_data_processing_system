CEB to act when flood water recedes

Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) maintenance teams are readied to spring into action and restore electricity supplies to affected households and institutions the moment flood waters recede, Power and Renewable Energy Minister Ranjith Siyambalapitiya said.
The minister made this observation at a conference at the Matara Electricity Grid Station and Consumer Service Centre on Tuesday.
Minister Siyambalapitiya said: "CEB employees have worked as a team to restore electricity supplies to affected consumers. I am thankful to everyone of them for their devotion to duty during this national emergency."
The minister said nearly 625,000 consumers lost electricity supplies due to disconnections carried out for security reasons during recent landslide, flood and gale conditions.
This had reduced to 177,775 because the rest have been restored with the return of normalcy in certain areas, he said.
This meant that only 28.4 percent of the people who faced the disaster situation were now without supplies.
Minister Siyambalapitiya said a large number of CEB offices in the Matara, Ratnapura and Galle districts were submerged by flood waters. The worst affected were those in the Matara district. He said maintenance teams had been strengthened by posting workers from unaffected areas to the affected areas.
The minister said the CEB had announced a relief package to disaster affected consumers. If electricity lines and metres had been broken, they would be replaced free of charge. Consumers had been given a grace period of six months to settle arrears of electricity bills for May and June in installments.
Minister Siyambalapitiya said when people whose house were fully destroyed are re-settled, they would be provided with electricity connections free of charge and exempted from paying arrears of electricity bills. Owners of small scale business and industrial ventures would be given six months to pay arrears of electricity bills in installments. He said distressed people can contact telephone number 011-3030303 to get their electricity needs attended.
