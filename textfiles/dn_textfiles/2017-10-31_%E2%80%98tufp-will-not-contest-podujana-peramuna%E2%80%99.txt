‘TUFP will not contest with Podujana Peramuna’

The Tamil United Freedom Party (TUFP) will not contest the local government elections with the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna affiliated with former President Mahinda Rajapaksa but will join him at a General Election, said TUFP General Secretary V. Kamaladas.
The TUFP is led by former Deputy Minister and Vice President of the SLFP, Vinayagamoorthy Muralitharan alias ‘Karuna Amman’.
“Our party is against the new Constitution. It has to be defeated. Hence, we will work together with Mahinda’s group on a national level. Although we will have our own party offices at the local government level,we will support Mahinda Rajapaksa at a future Presidential election,” added Kamaladas speaking to the Daily News.
The TUFP had conveyed this message to former Minister Basil Rajapaksa during a meeting between the two parties, yesterday.
