Gazette notification to reduce prices of eye lenses

Health Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne ordered ministry Secretary Anura Jayawickrama to issue a gazette notification on reducing the prices of eye lenses, Health Ministry sources said.
According to the sources, the Health Ministry received many complaints from patients in connection with high prices of eye lenses used for cataract surgeries.
Some lenses imported from India for Rs. 6,000 are sold for Rs. 25,000 or more to patients. An eye lens can be sold for Rs. 10,000 for a patient, the sources said.
Minister Senaratne instructed the officials of the National Medicine Regulatory Authority (NMRA) to formulate a price formula for surgical items, the sources said.
