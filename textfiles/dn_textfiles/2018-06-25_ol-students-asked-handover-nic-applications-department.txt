Postal strike continues
O/L students asked to handover NIC applications to Department

Commissioner General of Department of Registration for Persons Viyani Gunathilake has sent a special message to school heads.
The message informs that students who wish to obtain their NICs for the GCE (O/L) Examination-2018 in December to hand over their applications to the Department since a postal workers’ strike continues. Only 60 per cent of students have so far applied for the NICs and the rest are instructed to apply for their NICs through their heads of schools as early as possible to avoid delays.
The school heads were instructed by the Department to send their applications for NICs to the department, Krunegala District Senior Education Director W.M.Balasooriya said.
