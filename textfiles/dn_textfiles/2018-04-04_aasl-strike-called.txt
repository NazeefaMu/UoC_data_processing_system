AASL strike called off

Employees at the Bandaranaike International Airport (AASL) who engaged in strike action yesterday morning, called it off last evening as authorities agreed to the payment of allowances.
Airport Sri Lanka Freedom Party Union (ASFPU) members had blocked all three entrances to the Airport using backhoes and other vehicles. The aviation sector however was operational and security and air traffic controllers continued to function during the strike.
The union had met Transport and Civil Aviation Minister, Nimal Siripala de Silva on March 28 but they failed to reach an agreement on the occasion.
Transport and Civil Aviation Ministry Secretary G.S. Withanage told Daily News they had agreed to sign an agreement to provide an allowance of Rs 10,000 per month for three years.
The Union had alleged that eventhough the Airport & Aviation Services (Sri Lanka) Limited had promised them a Rs 10,000 increase in 2015 they have not been paid it for the last three years. “The allowances will be paid with no increment to the salary,” Withanage said . The Police, Special Task Force (STF) and anti-riot squads had been called for during the chaos at the airport. Union Convener M.W.P Muhandiram was not available for comment despite various attempts made to contact him.
