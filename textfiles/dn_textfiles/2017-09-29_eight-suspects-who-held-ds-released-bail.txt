Eight suspects who held up DS released on bail

The eight suspects who held up the Suriyawewa Divisional Secretary for eight hours, were produced before the Hambantota Magistrate's Courts and released on bail of Rs. 200,000 each.
The suspects were convicted for holding up the Suriyawewa Divisional Secretary when he came to meet the protestors at Buruthakanda.
Buruthakanda and Suriyawewa residents held up the Divisional Secretary during a protest against the death of a woman caused by a wild elephant. The Divisional Secretary fell sick and was admitted to the Hambantota General Hospital.
