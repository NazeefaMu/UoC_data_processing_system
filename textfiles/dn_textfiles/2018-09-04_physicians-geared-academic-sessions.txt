Physicians geared for academic sessions

The Ceylon College of Physicians (CCP) will hold its 51st Annual Academic Sessions from September 12 to 15 at the Galadari Hotel, Colombo.
The fellows, members and associate members of the College, numbering over 700 throughout the country in the state and private sectors, will come together over four days for academic deliberations.
The academic programme will get underway with the inauguration in the morning of September 12. The Chief Guest is Professor Sudharshan Seneviratne, Emeritus Professor of the University of Peradeniya, former Director-General of the Central Cultural Fund, and former High Commissioner for Sri Lanka to India. At the inauguration, the CCP Oration, titled ‘Medicine and the structure of knowledge’, will be delivered by Professor Anand Zachariah, Professor of Medicine, Christian Medical College, Vellore, India.
The academic programme comprises 14 plenaries, 18 symposia, eight special workshops, several teaching sessions for trainees and six free paper sessions. The free paper sessions will feature 45 local research papers vying for seven awards. There will also be two memorial orations: P.B. Fernando Memorial Oration by Dr. Ananda Wijewickrama, National Institute of Infectious Diseases and K. Rajasuriya Memorial Oration by Professor Udaya Ralapanawa, University of Peradeniya.
The resource persons will include 35 overseas (including 10 expatriate) speakers and over 40 local speakers. The theme of the conference ‘Inventing the future, with Science, Professionalism, Knowledge’ seeks to lay the foundation for the College’s second 50 years of existence, the 50th anniversary having been celebrated on a grand scale last year.
The CCP was established in 1967, with Dr. E. M. Wijerama as the Founder-President, and was incorporated in Parliament in 1972 before the country changed its name to Sri Lanka. It is a voluntary professional organisation dedicated to uplift the standards of specialist medicine, which includes General Internal Medicine, Cardiology, Endocrinology, Gastroenterology, Geriatrics, Nephrology, Neurology, Pulmonology and Rheumatology.
It is also a major contributor to multi-disciplinary fields such as Critical Care Medicine and Emergency Medicine.
Providing high-standard healthcare to the public is its goal. It does this by providing Continuing Professional Development (CPD) for its membership and training facilities for those aspiring to be specialist physicians. Its activities are funded through sponsorships and philanthropy.
It is a non-profit organisation and the dedicated, untiring and quiet contributions of its fellows and members, often at their own expense, generate the drive forward.
More information is available on the CCP website (ccp.lk), which also provides the link to the conference website where online registration is also available.
