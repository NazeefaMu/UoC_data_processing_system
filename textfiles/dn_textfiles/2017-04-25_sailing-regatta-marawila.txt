Sailing Regatta at Marawila

The Asian-German Sports Exchange Programme will conduct a Sailing Regatta at Marawila this year in which competitors from Sri Lanka, India and Maldives will take part. It will be held with the intention of promoting sailing in the North Western Province coastal belt from Wennappuwa to Chilaw.
It will be followed by another sailing regatta on a bigger scale next year in which competitors from Europe, New Zealand, Australia, Japan, South Korea and Sri Lanka will take part which would help to promote the region as a tourist destination as the competitors from foreign countries will be visiting the country along with their family members and friends.
