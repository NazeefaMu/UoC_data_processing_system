Case on leasing state land postponed to Sep. 27

Panadura Provincial High Court Judge Damith Thotawatte directed the State Counsel to inform court whether the Panadura Division Coordinating Committee had legal powers to lease state lands to individuals or societies.
This was when a Mandamus petition filed by M. K. Anil Erwin Nanayakkara, the Managing Director of Lotus Flower International Company of Thalpitiya in Wadduwa came up for inquiry on September 3.
The Judge postponed further inquiry for September 27 calling for a report.
The Western Provincial Council, after perusing documents regarding a plot of state land at Ratnayaka Place, Thalpitiya South in Wadduwa, had made a decision to lease it to the petitioner of the Mandamus. However, the decision of the Western Provincial Council had been dishonoured by the Panadura Division Coordinating Committee as it had decided to lease it to the Daladawatte Welfare Society. The petitioner challenged the decision of the Panadura Division Coordinating Committee through a Writ of Mandamus and a Writ of Certiorari.
The Counsel for the petitioner Sisira Kodikara in his submission to court said the approval of the Panadura Division Coordinating Committee had been obtained by the Panadura Divisional Secretary in a letter with the forged signature.
