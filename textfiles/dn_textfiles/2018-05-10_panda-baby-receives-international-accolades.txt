Panda Baby receives international accolades

Panda Baby recently launched Sri Lanka’s first 100% Natural Baby Oil, made purely with a carefully selected blend of 5 nourishing natural oils, natural vitamin E and a natural fragrance, this revolutionary product received the prestigious Nature natural certification by The International Natural and Organic Cosmetics Association in Europe.
The product has also been Pediatrician-tested, Dermatologist-tested and Proven for Mildness by an FDA approved research laboratory in USA.
Dr. Nimal Punyasiri, Director of Research and Development at Nature’s Beauty Creations stated, “We always pride ourselves in manufacturing products of the highest quality, and we are proud to unveil our Panda baby oil which is truly the purest, most natural and highest certified baby oil in Sri Lanka. Majority of other baby oil brands in the market are synthetic and use Mineral Oil, Paraffinium Liquidium or White Oil as they are cheaper than natural oils.
They also use synthetic fragrances. However, to ensure that Panda baby oil is 100% natural and does not contain any synthetic ingredients, we have even carefully selected a natural certified fragrance from France to give our babies nature’s best.” Explaining the benefits of usingan all-natural baby oil, Dr. Nimal mentioned, “It is great for naturally moisturizing and softening baby’s skin, protecting from dryness. Unlike mineral oil, natural oils such as Virgin Coconut Oil, Almond Oil, Olive Oil, Sesame OiI and Sunflower Oil, (which are natural oils found in the Panda baby oil), are similar to the oils produced by the baby’s skin. Therefore, these natural oils provide a direct caring and nourishing benefit to the baby’s skin.”
The Dermatologist and Pediatrician-tested Panda Baby range is manufactured by Nature’s Beauty Creations Ltd., Sri Lanka’s first and largest herbal personal care manufacturer with European recognized GMP and ISO quality standards.
It is also a US FDA registered production facility.The ultramodern manufacturing complex is nestled within a sprawling medicinal plant garden created by the company with over 800 medicinal plant varieties.
