UNP, SLFP agree to common agenda

The SLFP Ministers and UNP Ministers will put their heads together and come up with a new programme for the Government shortly, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said.
The Prime Minister said that two ministerial groups from both the parties held discussions on the way ahead for the Government on Wednesday night in the aftermath of the defection of 16 SLFP members.
“The SLFP ministers met the President prior to this meeting. We discussed on forging ahead with a new programme. I expect that we will receive it very soon, so that we can go forward based on it,” said the Prime Minister.
The Premier made these comments at a ceremony in Thalapathpitiya yesterday to begin the construction of a 30-storeyed middle class housing complex consisting of 400 housing units.
Speaking to the Daily News, UPFA General Secretary and Minister Mahinda Amaraweera said the meeting between the ministers of SLFP and UNP was centered on evolving a common agenda for the Government rectifying the shortcomings in the past. “It was emphasised during the meeting that we need to have one leadership and one programme if we are to govern together. There must be transparency and both parties must be kept in the loop,” he said.
He said both parties would agree on a common policy framework and a committee compromising of members of both parties would be appointed to finalise it. “The proposed new programme will be presented to the President and the Prime Minister after the Sinhala and Tamil New Year,” he added.
