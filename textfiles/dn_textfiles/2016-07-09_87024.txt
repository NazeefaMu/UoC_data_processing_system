VAT (Amendment) Bill to be taken up in Parliament on July 20

The Value Added Tax (Amendment) Bill has been scheduled to be taken up in Parliament on July 20, Leader of the House and Minister Lakshman Kiriella said. He said the Party Leaders were in agreement to take up the Bill during the next Parliamentary sittings week, but, if petitions were filed before the Supreme Court, Parliament may have to postpone it. Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayake presenting the Bill for the first reading asked the chair when it could be taken up for debate, while observing it must be passed without delay. He said some people were trying to gain political mileage out of the VAT issue.
Deputy Speaker Thilanga Sumathipala said the Bill has been scheduled for July 20, but added there were reports that some parties were planning to go before the Supreme Court over its provisions. He said if so the date would have to be changed again. As of the Bill, the wholesale and retail supply of goods has been exempted from the VAT till May 2, 2016. However, VAT would apply to the wholesale and retail supply of goods after May 2.
