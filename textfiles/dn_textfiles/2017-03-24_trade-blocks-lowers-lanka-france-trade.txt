Currently exports from Sri Lanka to Franc are around 200 million Euros while the exporters from France are only Euro 100 million. “There is certainly room to improve,” he said.
Country Director AFD France one of the largest donor agencies in the world said that they have been in Sri Lanka since 2009 and have credited around US$ 300 million for various government and private sector projects and banks.
