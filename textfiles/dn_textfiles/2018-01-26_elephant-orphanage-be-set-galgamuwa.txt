Elephant orphanage to be set up in Galgamuwa

Minister of Buddhasasana and Sustainable Development and Wildlife and Kurunegala District Parliamentarian Gamini Jayawickrama Perera has taken steps to set up an elephant orphanage in the Kurunegala district. A plot of land of 800 acres has been selected for this purpose in Galgamuwa electorate of the Kurunegala District.
Orphan and injured elephants from the North Western Province will find sanctuary here. In future, this area would be developed as a tourist attraction too, the Minister said.
