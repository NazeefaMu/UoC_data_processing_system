P.M.B. ready to purchase Yala paddy harvest

Paddy Marketing Board has taken initial steps to purchase paddy harvest of Yala season in Matale district, an officer of P.M.B. said.
At the beginning of August, Yala harvesting period will begin while the paddy stores in the district are clearing now so as to store the paddy harvest reaping from the Yala season. The state guaranteed price of Nadu and samba varieties is Rs.38 and Rs.41 respectively while the private sector is purchasing these varieties for Rs.40 and Rs.45 per kilo respectively.
However, Paddy Marketing Board is taking paddy on due standard. Therefore, farmers are reluctant to sell their paddy to P.M.B. though the private sector does not care about any standard. Under this situation, farmers are eager to sell their paddy harvest to the private sector. In accordance with that, during the current season, farmers can sell their paddy harvest without any delay, officers said.
