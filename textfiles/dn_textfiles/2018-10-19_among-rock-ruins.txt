Among Rock Ruins

Juliet Coombe explores the heady heights of Dambadeniya, Sri Lanka’s Third Kingdom, dating back 800 years and during a half day climb discovers a fascinating fortified rock fortress with plenty of fascinating things to see.
A waterfall of rain suddenly erupted from a peaceful tropical sunny sky, forcing us to take cover at the kade village snack shop at the foot of the royal rock palace stairway of Dambadeniya, Sri Lanka’s Third Kingdom, dating back 800 years. The shop was owned by Jayerathphne, who treated us to the traditional, pre-colonial tea called Bellimal (fruit flower), a surprisingly delicious and energising local brew. As the water cascaded, like Niagara falls, locking us inside his shop, we learnt how his father, on preparing the site for their current house at the base of the rock palace, discovered a moonstone covered in ‘copper’, or so he thought, and a pot of coins, which had squares cut out of their centres. The grapevine has it that around the area other discoveries have been made including hairpins, earrings and other types of jewellery.
My naturalist guide Hemantha brought with him a passionate local expert Chinthaka, who has been exploring this area since his early teens, to tell us all about this fascinating little known site. He made us laugh as with the biggest twinkle in his eyes he said that the objects found by the surrounding villages might explain how some of the people have suddenly acquired four-wheel drive vehicles! Jayerathphne’s father innocently went on to sell the moonstone in the 1930s to a dealer whilst keeping a small section of the metal, which they later made into a lotus flower to donate to the temple. It was then that they discovered from the jewellery maker that the copper was in fact gold and later were told that the moonstone ended up in a British collection.
With these stories in mind, we started to climb the 298 steps of this ancient rock fortress and were incredibly surprised and impressed by how the rampart walls, made of granite blocks, blend with this natural edifice by both protecting against invasion and erosion, and maintaining the status of the king. At a point near the top, the steps are deliberately steep and short to slow you down so that the king could decide whether he wished to have an audience with you or not. It was also a method used to force respect on the people whether in a temple or palace. Take a closer look at the granite steps you are climbing as they are a fascinating insight into an extraordinarily clever method of breaking the vast granite rocks into five foot square lintel-like steps. Imagine the painstaking process of using a square, hollow, and probably easily blunted, chisel or punch to chip out one inch square holes an inch apart into the parent rock, then filled with a specific dry wood, which when water was added made the wood swell and split the brittle granite.
Three quarters of the way up we come to the palace ruins, built on a flat area with the most amazing views of the surrounding countryside, neighbouring vast rocks, paddy fields and coconut plantations for as far as the eye can see. Don’t forget to place another stick for good luck, alongside all the other visitors’ sticks that look like an amusing attempt to stop the giant rock rolling over in its sleep. It was here an incredible clay map of the country was found in the 1970s excavations and sent, along with other valuable artifacts, to the Colombo museum.
Climbing to the top, we reach a stunning lookout point that once supported a watchtower, with incredible 360-degree views of the surrounding countryside. Look across to the west and you will see Dambadeniya’s sister rock where the king’s architect was incarcerated, to prevent him from escaping to other lands with knowledge of the palace and secret tunnels that might enable an enemy to overcome the kingdom. Chinthaka explains, “If you abseil over the lookout point half way down this shear face you will find a large tunnel entrance, big enough for an elephant,” This might have been a platform that one of the four kings, perhaps Parakramabahu, might have addressed the masses below. From the watchtower you can also see, on a clear day, Adam’s Peak to the north, Kurunegala to the south-west and Kegalle to the east. Chinthaka points out a tree, in the middle distance, explaining that the visible white flowers, which must be huge close up, are from the Thallanala tree that flowers only once in its lifetime, attracting huge numbers of bees, after which it promptly dies.
With this in mind we carefully start our descent, passing a water reservoir probably for royal bathing, hewn out of the rock, which you can see once had a wall across it that tied neatly into each end of the rock. Further down we observed excavations activity and saw how ancient small red grooved tiles that had been exposed, had been beautifully stacked into the shape of a stupa. Then, over to one side we came upon a wavy ornamental garden wall that overlooked a huge pool, probably secluded away for the royal family as well as maybe being a water reservoir for the community. Then the last of the ruins, the assembly house on a prominent outcropping rock with stairs hewn into it, affords a slightly closer look at the plantations and paddy fields below.
Everywhere was evidence of nature’s beauty and power to reclaim. Butterflies, with six-inch velvet wings and amazing purple spots the size of pennies, flit around us, occasionally alighting to see if the colours of our clothes promise any sustenance while twisting trees attempt to swallow rocks whole with their root systems and drape vines the size of my wrist along the paths, and yet others cover stones with a mass of maggoty roots while their neighbours grow in and out of each other or die, to be consumed by anthills, in this once diverse and manicured forest around the rock; home also to many songs and sounds from diverse birds such as hill swallows, blue-faced Malcohas, grey hornbills and rosewing parrots.
As I take one last look at another tunnel entrance now collapsed and then across the flat land to the jailhouse rock, I remember the story of how the architect’s wife smuggled his tools to him in his lunch packets so that he could carve out steps to escape. When you look at the rock you can see the steps coming down the face only to stop suddenly and this is where his wife arranged a crash mat of paddy straw for him to drop quietly onto in the dead of night on pain of death. I wonder if, like the ancient Egyptians, the secret of the tunnels must be kept at all cost and this is the price you pay for being the King’s architect. What divine justice, then, that he should escape with his wife in such a fashion.
