‘Don’t pay for substandard  constructions: Daya

Primery Industries Minister Daya Gamage advised public officials not to pay for substandard constructions. Addressing the Ampara District Development committee meeting, he said they should determine if the construction has been done as required.
Government officers should serve the public properly, he said, adding that his Primary Industries Ministry will implement all plans by the end of March.
He noted that a massive sum was needed to resolve the grave water problem in the district.
Gamage expressed dissatisfaction over the steps taken by the Wildlife Conservation Department to prevent wild elephants from invading villages. The Department officers should enforce the law against encroachments, he added.
