NWS&DB employees end strike

The employees of the National Water Supply and Drainage Board (NWS&DB) who had been engaged in strike action since February 2 have suspended their strike after officials from the board agreed to their demands to increase their salary by 25%.
“What they have asked for is not unfair. They are usually given a salary increment of 25% to 30% once in three years,” the NWS&DB General Mnager Engineer D.U.Sumanasekara said.
“We have accepted their demands and are willing to give them a 25% salary increase,” Sumanasekara said.
