Police report, Grama Niladari certificate a must for LG election contestants

The Lanka Federation of Self National Employees yesterday, urged the Elections Commissioner to make a Police report and a Grama Seva Niladari’s certificate for the contestants at the Local Government Elections before they take oaths, provided they win the election. Stating that 251 contestants from all parties in the Colombo District have allegedly had involvements with crimes, the Lanka Federation of Self National Employees Chairman Sunil Jayawardena made the request by way of a complaint made at the Elections Secretariat yesterday morning.
In his complaint, he stated that approximately 20 percent of the contestants islandwide were persons who had been involved in criminal activities. He added that some contestants had charges of heroin trafficking, illegal liquor trading, while some were involved in prostitution. He added that if these persons were to be elected members, the Police would not be able to execute their duties and their activities would worsen.
He also said that some had connections even with Islam extremist organizations, local and overseas. He added that their association was ready to share their facts with the authorities.
