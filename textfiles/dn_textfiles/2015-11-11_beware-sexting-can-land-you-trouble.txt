Beware! Sexting can land you in trouble

Digital devices and social media have made sexual exchanges instantaneous and more gratifying. Just one slightest mistake, though, can put your reputation on the line.
It begins with a Facebook friend request. Once accepted, you embark on a let's-get-to-know each-other-better adventure without wasting any time. Things escalate quickly from kiss blowing emojis to conversations that are more intimate. The action gets hotter as your fingers flutter on the keypad at breakneck speed. "Hey baby, I'm going to hit the gym," you say, and he demands a sweaty workout picture that reveals your cleavage. Having lost almost 10 pounds in the past couple of months, you happily show off your curves. The next time, you decide to turn up the heat by sending him a semi-nude out-of-the-shower selfie and that is followed by a graphic account of your body. Your three month-relationship is sailing smoothly, but then suddenly, it hits the inevitable tip of an iceberg. And as you sling mud at each other, it occurs to you that you probably shouldn't. After all, the boy owns your reputation.
No matter how much you trust your partner, a compromising photo could come back to haunt you for the rest of your life. But does this mean we conclude our sexting experiments altogether? Make your decision while we offer a low-down.
NOT-SO-SWEET SIXTEEN
Remember your initial days in college when you were struck by Cupid's arrow? The very sight of your crush made your heart go pitter patter, and you were convinced that he was the one. Natasha Sabrewal, 18, and her boyfriend Ryan D'Souza were in a stable relationship for over a year. They went to the same college and watched the same movies. While both of them promised each other that they wouldn't have sex till they graduated, they saw no harm in sexting and sharing sexual selfies. Little did they know that they were rocking the boat. "We never crossed our limit as teenagers, but there were times when we just couldn't resist the attraction. So we sexted a couple of nights every week. One baneful day Ryan forgot his phone at a friend's place. By the time he could go back and pick it up, his friend had transferred all our personal pictures to his phone and began blackmailing us. We were in college and we hardly had any money so we took the matter to our parents who were rather unforgiving. Although Ryan and I are still together, my parents refuse to treat me like before. This tragic episode has left me traumatised. I often get nightmares of the pictures resurfacing on social media," regrets a vulnerable Natasha. Just one click and your private pictures are instantaneously shared with many people. The problem is, once it's on social media, there's no going back.
REVENGE OF THE EX
Kavita Mittal, 30, was over the moon after getting engaged to the love of her life -a hand some, soft-spoken boy she'd met on a matrimony site. The D-day was finalised and relatives from across the world were going to fly down for the wedding. But a stroke of bad luck changed the course of her life -an email sent by her exboyfriend to her fiancee's sister. It had a number of attachments, including intimate chats and seminude images of Kavita. "When you're in love, you're ready to do anything for that person. That's where I went wrong. I never knew things would take such an unfortunate turn," says a disheartened Kavita, who later married her fiancee in a simple ceremony, against their family's wish.
"Sexting works well for mature couples and strengthens their bond, especially when they spend long periods apart. However, this phenomenon can prove to be dangerous for those who don't understand its consequences. It begins with harmless emoticons and there's a gradual exposure to semi-nude and nude selfies," says Dr Shyam Mithiya, psychiatrist, sexologist and counsellor. He indicates that sexting also caused a significant increase in the number of divorce cases. "There's an instant loss of emotional connect between couples after a fight, and when that happens, the partners turn into individuals and begin to connect with newer people on WhatsApp or Facebook -emotionally and then physically. One thing leads to another and both individuals no longer wish to work things out as a couple," he says.
WHAT IS SEXTING?
Sexting is the act of sending, receiving or forwarding sexually explicit messages or photos via cellphone, computer or other digital device. The term `sext' was first used by the media in 2005 and was also considered for the New Oxford American Dictionary 2009 Word of the Year. The trend is popular among teens with approximately 25 to 30 per cent of them admitting to sexting.

FIVE TIPS THAT WILL HELP KEEP SEXTS SAFE
THE NO-FACE RULE
It’s best to avoid sending a picture even to your husband. But if you have to, make sure you crop the face. In case of a photo leak, your identity will not be revealed.
USE SNAPCHAT
This app sets a timer to your pictures so they exist only for a few seconds.
STRANGER IS DANGER
Casually flirting with the guy at the bar? Beware!
SAY NO TO DRUNKEN SEXTS
Keep your phone away when you’re drunk, horny and have no control over yourself. You don’t want a series of `oops’ moments in the morning.
HIT DELETE
You never know who is snooping around, so delete all kinds of intimate communication between you and your partner, and advise him to do so as well.
