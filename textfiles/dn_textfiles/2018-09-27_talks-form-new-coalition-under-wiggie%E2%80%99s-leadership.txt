Talks to form a new coalition  under Wiggie’s leadership

Talks are underway between several Tamil parties in the North to form a new coalition under the leadership of Northern Province Chief Minister C.V.Vigneswaran by next month, according to former TNA MP Suresh Premachandran.
Speaking to the Daily News, he said the new coalition would be formed as an alternative to the Tamil National Alliance, as the people feel that the TNA had let them down. This coalition is expected to get the support of the Tamil United Liberation Front (TULF), All Ceylon Tamil Congress and other reputed Tamil parties.
It is also reported that while discussions with these parties have commenced, there has been favourable response from them for the formation of this new alliance.
This new alliance is to be formed under the total sponsorship of the Northern intellectuals, university student organisations and the Diaspora, it is reported.
It is said that Wigneswaran would take up the leadership of this alliance after the Northern Provincial Council term ends and it is dispersed.
Premachandran said, “Talks are taking place but it is still not finalised. I think there needs to be an alternative to the TNA as the people need a new leadership. The people strongly feel that the TNA has let them down and several issues facing the people that have not been sorted out yet and the powers and functions of the Provincial Council and the TNA leadership does not take up these matters in Parliament. Even the day-to-day resettlement and releasing of lands is also not being addressed. We feel that Sampanthan and group are working with the government and not doing anything to benefit the Tamil People. Hence, we feel we need a strong leadership for the North. We hope to see a new and strong political coalition in the near future,” he said.
However, he said there are several parties in discussion but did not disclose exactly how many parties would join this coalition.
