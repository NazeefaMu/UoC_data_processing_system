Detection machines to inspect sugar containers

The Government would import detection machines to inspect sugar containers as a solution to the smuggling of cocaine into the country in sugar containers, Law and Order and Southern Development Minister Sagala Ratnayake said in Parliament yesterday.
He said the Police Narcotics Bureau and the Organised Crime Prevention Division would be combined to form a new division under a senior DIG to investigate these incidents.
He said he would seek the permission of the National Police Commission to join the two divisions.
The minister made these observations while responding to a question raised by JVP Leader MP Anura Kumara Dissanayake over the last week detection of a haul of cocaine inside a sugar container.
Minister Rathnayake said investigations have revealed that the Government had no connection with smuggling cocaine in sugar containers. The Government wonder as to how and why cocaine is smuggled into the country in sugar containers. He said the Navy, the Customs and the Police Narcotics Bureau have conducted raids to nab drug kingpins.
Minister Ratnayake said the Government has found checking each sugar container a cumbersome action. The delay in releasing sugar containers from the Customs could create a shortage of sugar in the market, he said.
