Laws to be brought to insure laborers in companies with more than 10 workers

Labour and trade Union Relations Minister W.D.J.Seneviratne hands over a school bag to a child of a late labour during the ceremony.
Labour and Trade Union Relations Minister W.D.J.Seneviratne said that Laws will bring in soon to make compulsory for all private companies with more than 10 workers to have life insurance for the workers.
He said this while addressing the 19th anniversary of Sharam Vasana fund celebrated in Colombo recently. 
Minister Seneviratne said that at the moment the maximum compensation paid for a dead worker is only Rs. 550,000 which is not adequate at all.
Laws will be brought in soon to make it double (Rs. 1.1 million) without burdening the employer.
It will be done through a life insurance policy.  
 Minister Seneviratne pointed out that arrangements will be made soon to amend all compensations pay for the labourers who die during their duties.
There are a lot of accidents which have taken place in work places and several labourers have died by these accidents the Minister said.
 He said that labour Officials should act similar with officials who conduct Bribery Investigations.
Prompt legal action should be taken against all private companies which do not pay relevant compensation for the families of dead employees and offer other benefits to them, he added. 

Children of late labourers offer merits to their late fathers. <U+200B>
