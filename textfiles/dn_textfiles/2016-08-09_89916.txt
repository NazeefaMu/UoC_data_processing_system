Geelong set to host Sri Lanka T20 international

 
International cricket is headed to Geelong this summer, with Kardinia Park to host one of the three Twenty20 International matches against Sri Lanka next February.
Cricket Australia today confirmed the venues for the three-match KFC T20INTL Series, with the first game to be staged at the MCG on February 17 before the action heads to Geelong (February 19) and Adelaide Oval (February 22).
All three games will be double-headers with the Commonwealth Bank Southern Stars, who will take on New Zealand.
Sri Lanka will also feature in this summer's Prime Minister's XI match, to be played as a T20 fixture at Manuka Oval on February 15.
Kardinia Park, the 11th venue in Australia currently accredited to host international cricket, played host to a KFC Big Bash League warm-up match between the Melbourne Renegades and Stars and a two-day warm-up match between Victoria and West Indies last summer.
CA have also announced Adelaide Oval will continue to host an international match on Australia Day for the next five years.
This announcement completes the schedule for the 2016-17 international summer of cricket, which will see four nations tour Australia.
South Africa and Pakistan will each play a three-Test series against the home side, while Pakistan will also play a series of five one-day internationals in January.
The Black Caps will tour in early December for a three-match ODI series to defend the Chappell-Hadlee Trophy, the matches scheduled in between the South Africa and Pakistan Test series.
