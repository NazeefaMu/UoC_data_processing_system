Situation at Jayewardenepura Hospital:
GMOA to voice concerns to President

The Government Medical Officers' Association (GMOA) will inform President Maithripala Sirisena about the current dire situation of the Sri Jayewardenepura Hospital allegedly caused by the political appointment made by the Health Minister, GMOA Secretary Dr. Haritha Aluthge said.
He was addressing a press conference at the GMOA Head Quarters in Colombo yesterday.
Dr. Aluthge said the GMOA will submit their complaints to the Sri Lanka Medical Council (SLMC) and all other relevant institutions on the unethical practices of Sri Jayewardenepura Hospital Director appointed by the Health Minister.
According to Dr. Aluthge, this political appointee has launched a cunning and well-planned strategy against all consultants who oppose his unethical and illegal practices. Slinging mud against them using social media, cutting down additional allowances paid to them etc. are among the tactics employed. Now the strategy has improved up to the level of physically harassing consultants and threatening them.
"According to the Court judgement given, fresh applications should be called from qualified individuals and a new Director should be appointed to the Sri Jayewardenepura Hospital. But the current director who is a political appointee without the required qualifications remains in the position with the blessings of the Health Minister,” Dr. Aluthge alleged.
