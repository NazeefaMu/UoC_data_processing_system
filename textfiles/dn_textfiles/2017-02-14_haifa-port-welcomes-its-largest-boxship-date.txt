Haifa Port welcomes its largest Boxship to date

 
In today’s spotted, we bring an image of Maersk Elba, the largest containership to visit Israel’s Port of Haifa.
The Neopanamax boxship docked at the port’s Carmel Terminal in the morning hours of February 2, 2017.
The 13,092 dwt Maersk Elba features a length of 366 meters and a width of 48.2 meters.
Built by South Korean shipbuilder Hyundai Heavy Industries (HHI) in 2011, the vessel is owned by German-based shipping company Rickmers Reederei KG, VesselsValue’s data shows.
The Marshall Islands-flagged Maersk Elba is deployed in the service operated by 2M, an alliance between two container carriers including Maersk Line and Mediterranean Shipping Company (MSC).
Back in 2015, Maersk Line and MSC entered into a cooperation agreement with the Port of Haifa, bringing their ships to the port.
