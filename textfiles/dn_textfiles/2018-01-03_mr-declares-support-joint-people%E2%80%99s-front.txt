MR declares support for Joint People’s Front

Everybody wants my picture on their poster, but my picture belongs to the Pohottuwa, said Kurunegala MP and former President, Mahinda Rajapaksa as he declared his support for the Joint People’s Front at the upcoming polls. The former President addressed a meeting held at Sugathadasa Stadium yesterday (2) to launch the Joint People’s Front election campaign.“This election was won among many protests and struggles. On January 8 2015 we lost. We lost because a SLFP member, our own General Secretary went to the other side and contested against us. But 60 days later, we arose as a separate force”, said Rajapaksa.
Rajapaksa called on voters to support the Joint People’s Front represented by the Pohottuwa, instead of the SLFP, which he is a member of.
