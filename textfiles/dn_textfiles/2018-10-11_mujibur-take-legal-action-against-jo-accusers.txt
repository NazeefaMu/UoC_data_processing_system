‘Contaminated’ milk packets:
Mujibur to take legal action against JO accusers

UNP Colombo District Parliamentarian Mujiber Rahuman yesterday said he will take legal action against those who damaged his reputation by accusing him of distributing poisonous milk packets to the participants of the Joint Opposition janabalaya protest .
Addressing the media at Sirikotha yesterday, MP Rahuman said that the Government Analyst has already confirmed that the milk packets provided to the Joint Opposition protesters were not contaminated. By spreading this type of false information, the corrupt politicians of the previous regime attempted to create a Sinhala-Muslim conflict in order to cover up the utter failure of their ‘Jana Balaya Kolambata’ campaign and used it as a ruse to cover their heads in shame.
“I have lodged two Police complaints and I earnestly request from the IGP to investigate these complaints without any delay and take action against the culprits,” Rahuman added.
