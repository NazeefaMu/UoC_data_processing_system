Call of the Greenery

All of us are concerned about the Environment than older days as we know it is vital for us to have a safe life. For instance, all of us are facing global warming related issues at the moment. There are many real life stories about how environment damages created serious threats to human beings living in the world.
When we critically analyzed these stories the reasons for those was boiled down to the improper practices of humans. In other words, the responsibility to protect environment mainly lies with the human beings living in the world. Because of this very reason, green practices play a vital role to enhance the environmental protection.
In particular, these practices bring in a disciplined approach leading to implementing accepted norms with the intention of protecting and preserving the environment. Moreover, these practices have been introduced after a careful review of the environmental issues and to provide proactive solutions to protect the environment. Hence, Green Practices are becoming very popular and more and more people are keen to understand these practices and committed to protecting the environment in their professional as well as personal lives. The whole idea is to improve the quality of life of the people. Let’s look at some of the Green practices for our understanding purposes.
Five R’S
This is a very basic principle and can be used by anyone who is really keen to contribute to protecting the environment and the beauty of this concept is it can be used in a very practical manner and is a very effective one. The five R’s are Reduce, Reuse, Recycle, Renew and Respect. These practices go a long way to support the protection of the environment. Let’s look at these in a very brief manner.
Reduce
The idea of this concept is to contribute to the protection of the environment by reducing the consumption of every possible activity. For example you can reduce driving by limiting the use of car because sometimes we use our car to buy even a single item but if we can use an alternative approach we save our fuel contributing to protect the environment, reduce the consumption of energy as it has a rippling effect in their local community and worldwide, In other words reduce the use of electricity, reduce the use of cleaning supplies and likewise try to reduce every possible areas which has a contribution to environment.
Reuse
Look at the items that can be reused and as much as possible take steps to reuse those items. As a simple example is reuse your shopping bag without keeping a room to use multiple bags.
Recycle
This is another technique that we can use. Prepare a list of items that can be recycling, for example, laser printer cartridge, car battery, tires etc. and practice it.
Renew
Use as much as possible renewable resources. For example, if possible use solar power or wind generated power.
Respect
We need to always consider our environment and take every possible step to protect our environment by practicing the above concepts as much as possible. That helps to contribute to our society to develop a better environment paving the way to shrink your individual ecological footprint.
GREEN PRODUCTIVITY (GP)
This is also a concept that an organisation can use to protect environment whilst improving the productivity and business performance. It can be used by any type of organisation irrespective of their activities. Most of the organisations are concerned about the bottom-line of their organisation and GP support these organisations to reduce cost by helping to minimize wastages and to improve the product/service quality as both factors are strongly connected to overall profitability. The fundamental tools of GP are waste minimization, cleaner production, life cycle assessment and pollution prevention tools and use of those tools as part of the implementation of GP would result to savings providing a focused approach to protect the environment. In many situations, waste or pollution created due to inefficient manufacturing practices and those can be easily improved by practicing of GP tools. Productivity is a part and parcel of GP and therefore productivity improvements are taken into consideration when implementing GP. Moreover, the long -term perspective of GP is to have a better Environmental Management System incorporating the GP tools so that organisation has a strong foundation to improve environmental performance whilst improving the bottom-line.
ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT SYSTEM
Considering the importance of environment and to provide a globally accepted suitable management system, International Organization for Standardization (ISO) established a Technical Committee – TC 207 to formulate international standards on Environmental Management Systems. As a result of this, TC 207 produced the world’s first set of international environmental management system (EMS) standards in the year 1996 and it was accepted by more than 100 nations and adopted this international standard as their national standard. Like other standards established by ISO, ISO 14000 is a voluntary standard and it covers the specifications in a generic manner to establish an EMS tailor-made to any organisation. In the ISO 14000 series of standards, many other important standards have also been introduced like environmental product labeling, Life- Cycle Assessment, Environmental auditing, and on Environmental performance tools.
In this series ISO 14001 is the standard that an organisation can use to develop its environmental management system. An environmental management system helps organisations identify, manage, monitor and control their environmental issues in a “holistic” manner. ISO 14001 is suitable for organisations of all types and sizes, be they private, not-for-profit or governmental. ISO 14001 standard requires that an organisation considers all environmental related issues connected to its operations, such as air pollution, water and sewage issues, waste management, soil contamination and, resource use and efficiency. Therefore, for any organisation which is committed to run its operations whilst protecting the environment the best model that they can use is ISO 14001 standard as it provides all the relevant requirements that an organisation should meet.
All ISO standards are reviewed and revised regularly to make sure they remain relevant to the marketplace. The changes also ensure that the standard is compatible with other management system standards. Based on this principle, ISO 14001 EMS standard had undergone revision in the year 2004 and now the standard was again revised and republished in the year 2015, considering the current activities taking place in the world to have a better environmental management system.
The most important change that the new standard focused was the greater Commitment from Leadership. This is very important as without the top management commitment and leadership it is not possible to have an effective environmental management system (EMS) as the support of Leadership is vital to sort out all matters related to EMS. Moreover, the commitment of Leadership is very much important as the Leadership can always measure and monitor the performance of the ISO 14001 EMS and its contribution to environment protection and accordingly can make further relevant recommendations.
Moreover, the EMS system should be aligned with the strategic direction of the organisation and it can only be done with the commitment of leadership only. Furthermore, a focus on life-cycle thinking to ensure consideration of environmental aspects from development to end-of-life is a new area of the revised version and it provides a platform to look into the complete cycle of the process in a proactive manner as a much broader concept and that makes the EMS system more effective and to provide the results to protect the environment. There are multiple benefits in compliance with the ISO 14001 standard, such as market advantages, financial benefits, and efficiency and performance benefits.
ASTM STANDARDS
Enabling green practices, ASTM International has published a series of standards (nine standards) covering the best practices to have Green meetings, events, trade shows and conferences.
Now it is easier to hold environmentally friendly meetings and other events because of this series of ASTM standards. Furthermore, this series of standards detailed the requirements for choosing the location for an event, environmental sustainability criteria for set-up and dismantling of trade shows and the exhibits that are built within the event floor, criteria for evaluating and selecting transportation and focuses primarily on the reduction of carbon emissions from transport-related activity arising from events, encompasses the range of audio visual and production services required to provide staging, decor, and scenic elements, audio, video, lighting, and technical production, focuses on communications and marketing and covers paper, printed materials, promotional items, signage, educational materials, surveys, exhibitor advertising leaflets, event guides, describes procedural requirements for the evaluation and selection of accommodations for environmentally sustainable meetings, events, trade shows, or conferences and covers specifying, selecting, and procuring, food, beverage, and non-consumable food- or beverage-related items, and waste management, energy, and water- related practices.
GREEN BUILDINGS
The LEED green building rating programme in the U.S. is a very famous one which provides guidance on environmentally responsible design/construction and therefore it can be used by all relevant parties in the construction industry such as architects, contractors, and facility managers. In Sri Lanka, Green Building Council provides this facility of Green Building rating taking into consideration of Sri Lankan context. Buildings can be rated for their environmentally sustainable construction.
The term “green building” apply not just to products, but to construction strategies, building design, and orientation, building design, building operations, maintenance and many more. Normally this type of programme covers the areas like sustainable site development, water savings, energy efficiency, materials selection, indoor environment quality etc. Since these rating systems are based on international benchmarks the green building certification ensures that the building is sustainable.
Moreover, it is possible to calculate the individual impact that is the total set of Green House Gas (GHG) emissions caused directly and indirectly by an individual and that is called carbon footprint. There are many calculators available on the internet to calculate the carbon footprint. Once you can understand your carbon footprint it is possible to find ways and means to further reduce it. Out of many methods, some of those are the use of reusable bags when shopping, use of energy star appliances, plant trees, and much more we can do to make our environment -friendly.
It is our responsibility to make our environment green as it has a huge impact on our planet and that will provide a better platform for a future generation to live happily.
