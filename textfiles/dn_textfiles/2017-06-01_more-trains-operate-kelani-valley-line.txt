More trains to operate on Kelani Valley line

The number of trains running on the Kelani Valley railway line will be increased from five to eight to meet the increasing demand of passengers travelling daily from Padukka to Colombo Fort.
Transport and Civil Aviation Minister Nimal Siripala de Silva said, the government has planned to lay a double track from Padukka to Colombo Fort as well.
Accordingly, a socio-economic survey will be carried out in the surrounding areas of the Kelani valley railway line by an independent organization—UN HABITAT. It will be engaged in the task for at least six months.
“We have allocated Rs.1,000 million to build new railway stations as well as purchasing and installing high quality sleepers on this line,” the Minister said.
An awareness programme to educate politicians in the area regarding the survey was conducted recently at the Ministry Premises under patronage of Minister Nimal Siripala De Silva.
There have been a large number of unauthorised structures along the Kelani Valley railway line for the past 25 years.
This threatens the lives of train passengers as well as residents of the unauthorised constructions. The former regime and its politicians should be responsible for these unauthorised erections.
Proper decisions have not made in the right time due to the political influences. So, we had to face severe problems as a result of this,” he said.
The people of these houses
will evacuate without harming
their livelihoods. They will be provided with new houses or compensation.
A programme will be implemented in collaboration with the Megapolis and Western Development Ministry to distribute houses for these people in a section wise.
It will be positive to bring a very large number of people from Padukka to Colombo after improving the infrastructure facility.
