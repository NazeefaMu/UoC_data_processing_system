SLIIT introduces degree Faculty of Science and Education

SLIIT has introduced a new Faculty of Science and Education to meet emerging trends in the field of higher education. SLIIT is the leading non-state degree awarding institute approved by the University Grants Commission and the Ministry of Higher Education in Sri Lanka.
Qualifications ranging from Diploma in Early Childhood Education to Master of Education offered by the Faculty, grooms students to become professionals in the field of education. The first program on Bachelor of Education (Hons) in Physical Sciences has just opened for registration for the June intake. The content of the program is uniquely designed as it focuses on teaching the subjects of Physics and Mathematics with Education as the professional component.
This exceptional degree program is the first of many specialist education degree programs scheduled to be introduced at SLIIT. The other programs that will be offered for the 2019 intake include, Bachelor of Education (Hons) in Biological Sciences, Bachelor of Education (Hons) in English and Bachelor of Education (Hons) in Information Technology.
Graduates who successfully complete the Bachelor of Education (Hons) in Physical Sciences degree program have the potential to be employed as teachers for Advance Level classes in state and private schools. The demand for teaching vacancies for Physics and Mathematics is on an increasing trend in Sri Lanka and the current numbers of qualified teachers is insufficient.
Upon completion of the program the graduates also secure the competitive advantage over conventional science graduates as the Postgraduate Diploma in Education is not required for their career promotions and confirmation of employment.
In addition to the teaching sector of Sri Lanka, the graduates will also be competent to apply and be considered for vacancies in various state services such as the administrative services, education services, scientific services and the Sri Lanka Customs.
The Physics courses of the program were designed and will be conducted primarily by Prof. Denzil Rosa, one of the top Physics educators in the country. Prof. Rosa is an exceptional Physics teacher and is highly respected by graduates and advanced level students.
Apart from theory courses, each Physics module is coupled with a practical component.
