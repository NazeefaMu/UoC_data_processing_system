Fashioning the future

Global fashion trends have been rocking the city of late. However the country’s awakening towards this fast growing industry had begun on a small scale and had been given less emphasis in the years gone by.
This is evident in the manner that the newspapers of the era had stuck to simply providing political news and details about the incidents that have occurred across the country. Most of the fashion related images were found on advertisements while an occasional new form of attire was donned by an international model in a simple caption and picture, mostly as a filler to cover a blank space or to catch the eye of the reader and draw him or her to read the news items on that particular page.
Later as the interest towards the glamour scene evolved, more fashion articles made it to the Daily News pages. They began to appear regularly once a week on a page aimed at the female readership. ‘Feminine Round’ (1960), ‘Woman’s Sphere’ (1970), ‘Woman to Woman’, ‘Women & Leisure’ (1987 - 1994) and ‘Daily News Woman’ (2006) are some examples of the pages which carried articles which were regarded as female oriented. Maureen Hingert, the first Sri Lankan beauty queen to win an award as she became the runner up at the Miss Universe 1955 pageant and Rosy Senanayake’s triumph as Mrs World 1985 too fueled interest towards fashion and beauty as the Daily News had featured the charity work of the former Mrs World even on its front pages during the time of her reign.
With the dawn of the millennium, the global fashion industry began booming. More fashion related articles and even whole pages with models in colourful attire and various designs were published in the Daily News features section. From the Colombo Fashion Week and Lakme Fashion Week, India, to beauty pageants in the caliber of Miss Sri Lanka for Miss Universe and Miss Sri Lanka for Miss World, the Daily News has provided immense coverage to bring the latest fashion trends and beauty techniques to its readers.
Lake House newspapers have even sponsored beauty pageants, fashion designer competitions and bridal shows in the likes of Derana Veet Miss Sri Lanka for Miss Earth, Miss Sri Lanka for Miss Tourism Queen International, Ms Lanka for Ms Asia, Fashion Designer of the Year, CATS Singer Designer of the Year, Vivaha, Bridal Fair etc. The ‘Spice’ section carried on Saturdays in 2006 saw not only models on the ramp and individual photo shoots for clothing brands but also fashionistas tastefully dressed during various glamour events like cocktail parties, launches, embassy get-togethers and birthday bashes.
Today fashion photographs are carried and upcoming young designers have been interviewed and featured in the ‘Town and Country’ section on a regular basis. Garments ranging from bridal outfits, to cocktail dresses, casual clothes office wear, men’s cloths, children’s clothes, resort wear and lingerie grace the pages.
