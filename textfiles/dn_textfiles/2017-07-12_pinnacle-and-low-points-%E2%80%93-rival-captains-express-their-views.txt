Pinnacle and low points – rival captains express their views

HAMBANTOTA: Rival captains Angelo Mathews and Graeme Cremer expressed their views at the end of the five-match One-Day International series which Zimbabwe won 3-2 for their maiden series triumph in any format against Sri Lanka.
While victorious captain Cremer said the win was the pinnacle of his career, a dejected Mathews described the series defeat as one of the lowest points.
“I have been through a lot of good moments since I started playing. There’s been nothing like this. This is the pinnacle of my career. No doubt about that,” said Cremer as he and his team soaked in the historic victory at the Mahinda Rajapaksa Stadium in Sooriyawewa here on Monday.

“A series win in Sri Lanka is tough and to lead the team is a super feeling definitely the highest point in my career. The win is very special just knowing that quality Zimbabwe sides have come here and gone empty-handed makes the series win so special. As a team, the unity we had was special. To lead a team like that to a series win I am really happy,” he said.
Cremer said he was not sure why Sri Lanka kept some of their top players away from the series but added, “With the team they had on paper it was still a powerful team. We had plans for all those players. Given the way we played, the series would have gone the same way. We were excellent today in all three departments. We collapsed chasing today, but we played today to win the game and the series.”
Cremer emphasized the importance of fielding and said, “Fielding actually separates teams often. That catch from Musakanda was a turning point in the game. If not for that Sri Lanka could have got to 230 and that would have been a tough total. I thought our fielding was brilliant. Definitely fielding is a positive for us.”
Tarisai Musakanda plucked off a blinder of a catch at point to dismiss Akila Dananjaya when he was building up a useful eighth wicket partnership with Asela Gunaratne.
Cremer was all praise for all-rounder Sikander Raza and experienced opener Hamilton Masakadza who played key roles in Zimbabwe’s win.
Masakadza top scored with an important innings of 73 at the top and Raza whose off-breaks broke the back of the Lankan top order batting followed it up with a useful knock of 27 not out to see Zimbabwe home after an anxious period when they lost seven wickets for 175 chasing 204.
“Raza came on this tour after Scotland and Holland out of form. The faith we showed with him by keep selecting him was a confidence booster knowing that that the team backed him,” said Cremer. “This tour showed how dangerous he can be with bat and ball. He opened the bowling today and was brilliant. We knew Sri Lanka will be thinking that we will go with two pacers, but we decided to go with Raza and he was awesome. It was only pre-planned this morning.
“Masakadza is very experienced. His batting is crucial so is his experience. He has been in the team for so long and knows a lot. We are lucky to get his experience. His contributions are massive,” he said.
Cremer said the only way Zimbabwe can improve their cricket is for them to get more matches against stronger opposition.
Defeat hard to swallow - Mathews
Sri Lanka captain Mathews described the defeat as “a hard one to swallow”. “Everything went against us from toss to misreading the wicket. No excuses. At the end of the day we were not good enough to beat them. They played better cricket.
“We have a Test match with Zimbabwe before taking on India; we need to play the Test match well. This is a very hard defeat to bear. We did some costly mistakes,” said Mathews.
“I am bitterly disappointed. We didn’t play well. Our batting was a flop today although we did well throughout the series. There was some turn for the spinners in the beginning but our eventual score wasn’t enough. We have a lot of improvements to make. The Indian series will be even tougher. In a small period we have to fix our problems. As a team we did during training but nothing is working in the middle,” he said.
“Pressure is on all of us. The more we lose the more pressure we are under. There is no solution for that and the only solution is winning. We try to win games, but we commit too many mistakes. We did well with the bat in the last four games, but this game we were awful. If we could have got to 237 we could have done well.”
About his future as captain Mathews said, “Still haven’t thought about. There’s time. Give it a bit more thought. Talk to the selectors. I haven’t decided on anything yet.”
Sri Lanka and Zimbabwe will play a one-off Test at the R Premadasa Stadium starting on Friday. – ST
