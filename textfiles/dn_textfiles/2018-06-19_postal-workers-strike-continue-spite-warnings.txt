Postal workers' strike to continue in spite of warnings

 
The strike launched by the Postal and Telecommunication Officers Association will continue in-spite of warnings issued by the government to cancel leave and terminate the employment of postal workers who fail to report to work.
The decision was made by the trade union citing that authorities failed to provide adequate solutions to their demands at the meeting held yesterday, Postal and Telecommunication Officers Association President Chinthaka Bandara said.
Furthermore, Chinthaka Bandara said that the postal workers are determined to face any challenge until their demands are met by the authorities.
The strike is carried out by the Postal workers based on two demands, which are to amend the recruitment process of the department and make the profession of the Acting Sub Post Masters permanent.
