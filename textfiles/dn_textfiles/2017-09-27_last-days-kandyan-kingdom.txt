Last days of the Kandyan Kingdom

The downfall of the Kandyan kingdom can be traced back to the ascendancy of the Nayakkar rulers also called Vaduga or vaduge belonged to the vaduge caste, Telagu speaking group, originally hailed form Madurai. When their territory was overrun by the Muslims they moved to the Coramandal coast which formed part of the Vijayanagar empire.
It was King Senerat (1604-1635) who wanted to enhance the prestige of the line descendants by getting his son Rajasinha II (1635-1687) married to a Nayakkar princess from Madurai in South India. This practice of marrying a Nayakkar princess was followed by his son Vimaladharmasuriya II (1687-1707). Before King Narendrasinha died without issue, he nominated his queen’s brother Sri Vijaya Rajasinha (1739-1747), a Nayakkar as his successor and thereafter in 1739 Nayakkar dynasty became the ruling dynasty in the Kandyan kingdom.
Thus Nayakkar queens arrived in Kandy with their parents, brothers, sisters and close relatives. During this period there were many Nayakkar families living in Kandy. The kings occupied the present Malabar Street which was earlier called Kumaruppe Veediya which was made a forbidden area for the Sinhalese including the Buddhist Sangha.
Royal villages
The relatives of the Nayakkar rulers were maintained at state expense. They were given posts of honour and revenues of specified royal villages – Gabadagam. Some of them had trade dealings with the Dutch East India Company.
They traded with the Dutch and amassed considerable riches and provided money for the Sinhalese Chieftains and obtained valuable property close to the capital. Thus the Nayakkar families of the kings were economically better off than the Sinhalese chieftains. Along with their economic power Nayakkars became superior and remained aloof from the Sinhalese people.
There were other differences like religion and language that brought a rift between the Sinhalese people and the Nayakkars. They were Hindus and followed South Indian customs. They rarely married into Sinhalese families and remained close to their king giving him advice on the affairs of government and accepted bribes for granting favours from their king.
Nayakkars also created rivalries between ministers. They observed Hindu rituals conducted by the Brahmin priests and encouraged dancing in the royal court like what the Indian rulers did in their royal courts and they had Kavikara Maduwa to eulogize the kings by the minstrels.
Nayakkar dynasty
The Sinhalese chieftains complained to the kings about these changes that were disadvantageous to their interests. But the Nayakkar relatives of the king conspired to keep their power with the Nayakkar dynasty.
The resentment of the Sinhalese chieftains was first manifested in 1709 when Yalegoda Adikaram attempted to install Pattige Bandara, son of Vimala Dharma Suriya II by a Sinhalese wife in place of Narendrasinha, son of the same king by a Nayakkar queen.
The second rebellion in 1732 was caused by King Narendrasinha’s appointment of a Nayakkar to the important post of the Gabada Nilame in charge of the king’s lands.
The third attempt against the Nayakkar rule was an unsuccessful attempt by the chieftains. It was led by Leuke to place Unambuve Bandara, son of Narendrasinha by a Sinhalese wife on the throne in 1739, in preference to the King’s brother-in-law Sri Vijaya Rajasinha (1739-1747) who was a Nayakkar.
The fourth attempt was in 1749 when the ministers of King Kirthi Sri Rajasinha (1747-1782) wanted to place on the throne a person who would safeguard the customs of the Sinhalese. The ministers planned to appoint a Siamese prince to the throne. This move was headed by an Adikaram name Samarakkodi and the chief prelates of the Malwatte Vihara – Welivita and Tibbotuwawe Theras.
The fifth attempt was to dispose Rajadhi Rajasinha (1782-1798) and place Mapitiye Bandara, son of Kirthi Sri Rajasinha, on the throne.
The Nayakkar rulers survived all these plots because there was disunity and rivalry among the Sinhala chieftains. They were unhappy over the Nayakkar rulers but would prefer to see a foreign ruler on the throne rather than one of their own.
Against this background the actions of Adikarams and Pilimatalawa and Ehelepola should be examined. Pilimatalawa Adikaram was a nationalist who wanted to oust the Nayakkar rulers from the throne of Kandy.
When King Rajadhi Rajasinha died without issue, the opportunity arose for Pilimatalawa Adikaram to achieve his task. According to the custom of succession to the throne of the Nayakkars, the queen’s brother Muthusamy should have been elected by the chieftains and he was also nominated by the late king before he died. But Pilimatalawa Adhikram ignored this accepted custom and rejected Muthusamy’s claim to the throne. Instead he imprisoned Muthusamy and selected an unknown youth of 18 Kannasamy, who was the son of a sister of one of the queens. He was made the king as Sri Vikrama Rajasinha (1798-1815), who was the last King of Kandy.
