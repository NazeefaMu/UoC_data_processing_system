Japanese technology for long-term food preservation

A Japanese company has pledged to provide its Cells-Alive System (CAS) technology for fish and food preservation in Sri Lanka.
Fisheries and Aquatic Resources Development Minister Mahinda Amaraweera, during his recent visit to Japan, met ABI Chairman Norio Owada. The company management briefed the minister on the CAS technology which keeps food fresh for a longer period.
During the meeting, Minister Amaraweera inquired the possibility of using the CAS technology in Sri Lankan fisheries and other industries to reduce post-harvest loss.
ABI was established in 1989 and developed innovative CAS freezing technology for long-term storage by keeping tissue cells alive. Norio Owada developed a freezing system with magnetic induction function with which he succeeded in freezing cream for the first time in the world.
Thereafter, he invented CAS which was a revolution in long-term preservation of food products while keeping the taste of the defrost product as if it has just been harvested or produced.
