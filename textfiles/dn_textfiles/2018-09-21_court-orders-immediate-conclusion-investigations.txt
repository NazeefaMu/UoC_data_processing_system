Court orders immediate conclusion of investigations

While expressing his displeasure regarding the delay in investigations into the murder of former rugby player Wasim Thajudeen, Colombo Additional Magistrate Isuru Neththikumara yesterday ordered the CID to immediately conclude investigations into this murder case.
The Additional Magistrate observed that the Court cannot be satisfied with the progress of the investigation which initially commenced in 2012.
The Additional Magistrate further issued an order directing the CID to file a report in Court explaining the reasons which led to the delay in the ongoing investigations.
Meanwhile,the CID was directed to file a report regarding the summary of evidence available against three suspects, former DIG Anura Senanayake, former Narahenpita Crimes OIC Sumith Champika Perera and former Colombo Chief Medical Officer Prof. Ananda Samarasekara.
In reply to the allegation, Deputy Solicitor General Dilan Ratnayake appearing on behalf of the CID informed court that the CID was able to conduct a formal investigation after 2015, though the murder in fact occurred in 2012.
