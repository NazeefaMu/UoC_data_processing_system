Wait and see what will happen after Vesak: MR

Kurunegala district MP and former President Mahinda Rajapaksa asked people to wait and see what will happen in the country after Vesak.
He was responding to media personnel when they questioned him about the Joint Opposition (JO) pledge to bring about a change after two poya days.
The media personnel made the query when the former President visited Anuradhapura on April 20 to pay homage to the Jaya Sri Maha Bodhi and seek blessings for the New Year.
Mahinda Rajapaksa said the present government had miserably failed to bring about a positive change in the country as promised even though two years had elapsed since its victory.
He said the only change brought about was the collapse of the Meethotamulla garbage mountain.
Rajapaksa said the present government had failed to match the amount of development work undertaken by his government which successfully won the war and established peace in the country. When he was in power, he had drawn up plans to relocate the garbage mountain in Puttalam and allocated funds for the project but the subsequent defeat at election prevented its implementation.He said his government always worked according to proper planning and showed success.
He said the May Day Rally at Galle Face would prove to be the most successful this year because people are getting ready to fill up the entire Galle Face Green on this day despite government manoeuvres to deprive them of using public transport facilities or private buses.
Mahinda Rajapaksa and his entourage called on Ruwanweli Chaityaramadhipati Ven. Pallegama Hemaratne Thera and lankarama Chaityaramadhipati Ven. Ralapanawe Dhammaajothi Thera and received their blessings. They visited the Jaya Sri Maha Bodhi and participated in religious observances.
The Maha Sangha chanted seth pirith and invoked blessings on them. They also participated in religious observances at the Mirisavetiya.
Parliamentarians S.M. Chandrasena and S.C. Muthukumarana, Provincial Ministers S.M. Ranjith Samarakoon, K.H. Nandasena, and H.B. Semasinghe, North Central Provincial Council Chairman T.M.R. Siripala, Provincial Councillors Gamage Weerasena, K.P.S. Kumarasiri and former Anuradhapura Mayor H.P. Somadasa were present.
