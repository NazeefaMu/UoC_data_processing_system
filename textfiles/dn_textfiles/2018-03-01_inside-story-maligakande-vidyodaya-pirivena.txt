Inside story of  Maligakande Vidyodaya Pirivena

Dr Mahinda Relapawa’s latest legal publication titled as Maligakande Vidyodaya Pirivena Viharaye Nadu Theendu (Judgements of Maligakande Vidyodaya Piriven Viharaya) was launched at the Vidyodaya Piriven Hall (Hikkaduwa Sri Sumangala Mawatha, Maradana, Colombo 10) recently. Most Venerable Niyangoda Vijithasiri Mahanayaka Thera chaired the occasion. Chief Justice Priyasath Depp was the Chief Guest. The first copy of the book was presented to Venerable Balangoda Sobhitha Thera. Dr Wickrama Weerasuriya delivered the keynote address. Among the special guests were Venerable Ittepane Dhammalankara Mahanayaka Thera, Venerable Anamaduwe Dhammadassi Mahanayaka Thera, Venerable Vendaruwe Upali Mahanayaka Thera and Venerable Pallegama Sirinivasa Anunayaka Thera. The Supreme Court Judges Eva Wanasundera, Buwaneka Aluvihare, K T Chithrasiri, Priyantha Jayawardene, Prasanna Jayawardana, Vijith Malalgoda, L T B Dehideniya and Nalin Perera also graced the occasion.
The Vidyodya Pirivena was founded due to the efforts of Hikkaduwe Sri Sumangala Thera, who is considered to be one of the pioneers in the revival of Buddhism and the tradition of oriental education during the 19th Century in Sri Lanka.
The land at Maligakanda (a suburb of Colombo) and funds for its foundation were donated by the philanthropist Andiris Perera Dharmagunawardhana. Both Hikkaduwe Sri Sumangala Thera and Migettuwatte Gunananda Thera, following their success in the Panadura Debate, played key roles in its development.
Their aim was to train educated orator monks to save Buddhism from the decline it was undergoing due to colonial rule, and for that purpose it was made the study of logic compulsory in pirivena education.
The Pirivena taught Buddhist studies as well as pseudo-sciences such as astrology, which were widely accepted and held in high esteem in traditional society.
