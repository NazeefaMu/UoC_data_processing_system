Russian whistleblower lives in fear in America

New York: Doping guru Grigory Rodchenkov has emerged from hiding, donning a disguise and reiterating that Russian President Vladimir Putin wants to silence him for good.
The controversial whistleblower and former head of Moscow’s anti-doping laboratory says he is risking his life by exposing Russian doping secrets.
In his first televised interview since fleeing his native Russia, Rodchenkov told the American news programme 60 Minutes on Sunday night that he continues to live in fear in the United States.
“Kremlin wants me to stop talking,” Rodchenkov told interviewer Scott Pelley.
Since fleeing to America in November 2015, he has gone into hiding because he says Putin wants him dead -- a claim he has made several times previously.
The news magazine programme allowed Rodchenkov to wear a disguise and showed him putting on and walking around in a bulletproof vest.
“(The disguise) was done for security reasons,” says Rodchenkov, who dyed his hair a different colour and shaved his mustache. “There is information that my life is in jeopardy and we took all necessary steps.”
Rodchenkov’s escape to America followed the sudden death of two senior officials from Russia’s anti-doping agency. There is a warrant out for his arrest back home. AFP
