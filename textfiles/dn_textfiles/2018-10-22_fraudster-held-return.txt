Fraudster held on return

Bingiriya Police arrested a man who had allegedly defrauded 50 businessmen in the Kurunegala district of a total of Rs. 20 million, at the Katunayake Airport, when he returned from abroad after several years.
The suspect was to be produced before the Hettipola Magistrate on Friday.
The suspect had promised the victims that he would offer them interest rates of over 30 percent for their investments.
Bingiriya Police are investigating the case. Some 28 moneylenders have also been arrested by the police in the district during the past seven months, a senior police chief in Kurunegala told the Daily News.
