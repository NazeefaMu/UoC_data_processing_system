‘Imports disrupt local poultry farming’

Small-scale poultry farmers had been inconvenienced as a number of large-scale companies connected to the poultry industry were importing hens for the upcoming festive season, Kurunegala Poultry Farmers’ Association Chairman S.M. Premaratne said. He was addressing poultry farmers at a meeting held at Hettipola in Kurunegala, yesterday.
They said that they had been unable to sell their products at fair rates.
Therefore, the authorities concerned should take immediate measures to save local poultry farmers, he added.
About 23,000 small-scale poultry farmers in Kurunegala and Puttalam were affected by the issue, Premaratne added.
