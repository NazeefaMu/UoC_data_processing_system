Bed Bugs are normally active at night and cause red spots on the body which are often mistaken for mosquitoes or other insect bites.
Bed bugs like to nest in crevices and hollows in beds and sofas, clothing and upholstery, in the immediate vicinity of a host they can feed on. They are extremely troublesome and are very difficult to eradicate, once a serious infestation sets in. Eliminating them completely requires a destruction of the adult insect, larval stages and the eggs.
