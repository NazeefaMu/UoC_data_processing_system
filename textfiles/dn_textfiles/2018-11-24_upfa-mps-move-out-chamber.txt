UPFA MPs move out of Chamber

The UPFA government members walked out of the Chamber in protest against the Speaker’s actions.
This involves violating the Constitution, Standing Orders and Parliamentary tradition, Leader of the House, MP Dinesh Gunawardena said. “Never in the history of Parliament had there been a vote taken on the appointing of members to the Selection Committee and the Speaker is dancing to the tune of Sirikotha,” he said.
