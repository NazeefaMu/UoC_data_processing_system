Zimbabwe wins the toss, chooses to bowl

 
Zimbabwe won the toss and chose to bowl first in the deciding ODI, at Hambantota. The previous four matches in the series have been won by chasing sides.
Sri Lanka made two changes to the attack that failed to defend 219 off 31 overs on Saturday, swapping out the expensive Lakshan Sandakan and inexperienced Asitha Fernando, for Akila Dananjaya - the offspinner - and seam bowler Nuwan Kulasekara.
Dananjaya had played the first match but had been out of the XI since. Kulasekara is a late addition to the squad, having been added only after Nuwan Pradeep picked up a thigh strain. The batting order remains intact.
Zimbabwe, chasing their first series win away since 2009, made no changes to their winning XI, leaving seamer Chris Mpofu in the attack, and batsman Tarisai Musakanda in the top order.
The weather is expected to remain fine through the day, with temperatures in the low thirties.
Sri Lanka: 1 Niroshan Dickwella (wk), 2 Danushka Gunathilaka, 3 Kusal Mendis, 4 Upul Tharanga, 5 Angelo Mathews (capt.), 6 Asela Gunaratne, 7 Wanindu Hasaranga, 8 Nuwan Kulasekara, 9 Dushmantha Chameera, 10 Akila Dananjaya, 11 Lasith Malinga,
