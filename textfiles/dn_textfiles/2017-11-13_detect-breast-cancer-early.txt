Detect breast cancer early

MyDoctor.lk organised a “Breast cancer awareness symposium” for the fourth consecutive year recently to educate the public and address the common problems related to breast cancer. The keynote speaker was consultant surgeon of the Colombo South teaching hospital and
Professor in Surgery, Faculty of Medical Sciences, University of Sri Jayewardenepura, Prof. Aloka Pathirana.
In the early stages of breast cancer, symptoms are minimal, therefore disease might progress even without notice. Annually, more than 2,500 women in Sri Lanka are newly diagnosed with breast cancer. Thus it is a timely requirement to increase awareness on breast cancer and thereby to reduce the number of deaths caused.
Artists and people excelling in many fields including popular actress/model/presenter Vinu Udani Siriwardhane, participated in this symposium to encourage all women of Sri Lanka.
The founder of MyDoctor.lk, Dr. Harsha Jayakody and his team concluded the event by empowering ladies to detect symptoms of breast cancer at an early stage.
