UNP can form government of its own-MP Thushara Amarasena

Commenting on the so-called 'Caretaker Government' proposed to be established by the SLFP and SLPP, UNP MP Thushara Indunil Amarasena said if this happens then the UNP has the capacity to form a government of its own before the formation of 'Caretaker Government'.
"Around 10-12 SLFP ministers who do not want to work further with the corrupt politicians rejected by the people of this country in 2015 are willing to join with us to form a UNP government," he said. Addressing the media at Sirikotha yesterday, MP Amarasena said that since January 8, 2015, various attempts have been made by the Joint Opposition to topple the government. But, all these attempts hav neen futile.
"Therefore, this is another gimmick by this group to mislead the public," he said.
"If they really want to send this government home, they can easily do it by defeating the Budget 2019 without resorting to such chikdish acts to mislead the public," he added. The group of 16 SLFPers those who cannot live without power are trying to use this topic to latch up with the SLPP.
Commenting on the plot to assassinate President Maithripala Sirisena and former Defence Secretary Gotabhaya Rajapaksa, MP Amarasena said that there is an attempt to put this in to UNP account. "This is a discussion between an idler and a police officer. If this police officer had contacts with idlers like this, he is not suitable to hold his position," MP Amarasena added. The MP charged that Namal Kumara is getting a monthly salary from a leading institution. "So, it is suspicious that he is fulfilling a contract of that institution," he added.
He further stressed the importance of conducting an inquiry in to the alleged January 8 conspiracy of the former President and former Defence Secretary to retain power through military intervention.
