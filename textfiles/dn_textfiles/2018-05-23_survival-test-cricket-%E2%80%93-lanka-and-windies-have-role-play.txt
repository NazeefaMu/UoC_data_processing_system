Survival of Test cricket – Lanka and Windies have a role to play

After much rumblings about the tour being in danger of getting cancelled and the threat of the itinerary being pruned down to less than three Tests, Sri Lanka’s tour to the Caribbean after a lapse of ten years has somewhat survived the storm and thankfully will definitely go ahead as scheduled with no alterations to the itinerary.
Thus for the first time since the two teams began playing Test cricket in 1993 Sri Lanka will be involved in a three-Test series in the Caribbean. Sri Lanka’s past experience of Test tours to the West Indies have involved only a series of two Tests in 1997 and 2003 where they lost the series 1-0 on each occasion and in 2008 when they recorded their first-ever Test win in the Caribbean and drew the series one-all. Thus the current tour of the West Indies will be of historical value as they will be playing a three-Test series for the first time and furthermore will be looking to record their first-ever series win over there.
The reasons for a Test series between Sri Lanka and West Indies hardly attracting a world wide audience or filling the turnstiles at cricket venues is due to the absence of any superstars from either side whom people would pay money to go and watch.
Gone are the days when Sri Lanka was a force in world cricket when names such as Aravinda de Silva, Sanath Jayasuriya, Muthiah Muralitharan, Chaminda Vaas, Arjuna Ranatunga, Mahela Jayawardene and Kumar Sangakkara would attract a large audience to the grounds. These are iconic players who had stamped an indelible mark in cricket history. Cricket fans come to watch them play even in a five-day Test - that is the impact these cricketers had on the game. They were more or less game changers.
The present Sri Lanka team is still not established and following the retirements of greats like Muralitharan, Vaas, Jayasuriya, Jayawardene and Sangakkara have not quite produced an outstanding cricketer whom the fans can quite look up to and emulate as a role model. The team has an abundance of talent but there are no stand-out players like those mentioned to make heads turn and to admire. Maybe with time we could produce a few but until then we will struggle as a team to make an impact with cricket audiences.
In West Indies’ case the scenario is quite different. The inability of Cricket West Indies to have a control on their players has led to some of their glamour stars calling the shots and making themselves available for the national team only at their whim and fancy. Draw cards like Chris Gayle, Keiron Pollard, Dwayne Bravo and Andre Russell have all moved away from playing Test cricket for West Indies to concentrate on the shortest format Twenty20 around the world. By doing so they have weakened West Indies cricket to the extent that since the departure of iconic players like Viv Richards, Desmond Haynes, Gordon Greenidge, Clive Lloyd, Curtley Ambrose, Courtney Walsh and later Brian Lara, they have hardly regained those glory days of the sixties, seventies and early eighties. The advent of T20 cricket gave the cash strapped West Indies cricketers a leeway to make a fast buck with less effort on the field. For just three and a half hours or 40 overs of sweat they could earn twice or thrice as much money as they would playing Test cricket. Players in the caliber of Gayle, Russell and Co have been in big demand in T20 leagues across the world and draw cards because of their high success rate in this format.
Former Zimbabwe captain and coach and current coach of Kolkata Knight Riders in the ongoing IPL, Heath Streak put their success in T20 cricket down to boredom. Streak feels that the West Indies players are successful in T20 cricket because perhaps the 'powerful' Caribbeans get 'bored' playing Test cricket.
"Firstly, they enjoy it I think. They get bored by playing the long format of the game. A lot of them are playing all the leagues around the world if you look at guys like Andre and Sunil (Narine) from our team and others in the tournament like Pollard," Streak said.
"You are getting to a stage where guys are making a career solely out of playing T20 cricket.
They play in PSL (Pakistan), CPL (Caribbean), BBL (Big Bash), IPL. They've got physical attributes, the power. Guys like Pollard, Russell are physically strong even their mis-hits go over the boundary," Streak said.
The difference between the West Indies teams of the past and today is that the past greats had a point to prove to the white sahibs that they were as good if not better than them in the sport and they went all out to prove it. Under the leadership of Frank Worrell and Garry Sobers and later Clive Lloyd and his successor Viv Richards, West Indies were unconquerable with their quartet of legendary fast bowlers that dominated international cricket in the sixties, seventies and early eighties.
For Test cricket to survive countries like Sri Lanka and West Indies will have to do a balancing act with their international fixtures so that Test cricket is not outshone by the limited-over format for the sake of financial gains.
