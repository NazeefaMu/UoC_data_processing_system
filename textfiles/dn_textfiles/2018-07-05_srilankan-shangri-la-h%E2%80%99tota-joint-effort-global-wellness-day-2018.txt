SriLankan, Shangri-La H’tota in joint effort  on Global Wellness Day 2018

SriLankan Cares, the CSR arm of SriLankan Airlines, partnered with Shangri-La’s Hambantota Golf Resort and Spa to conduct a medical camp for needy communities in the Hambantota area for the second consecutive year on Global Wellness Day.
The medical campaign was a tremendous success, with approximately 300 people receiving medical consultation. The medical screening, which was held at Seetharama Temple, Hambantota, received positive comments from both the community and those who came in numbers to contribute and be a part of the project.
Voicing his thoughts on the importance of organizing an event of this scale, Head of Human Resources of SriLankan Airlines, Pradeepa Kekulawala, noted: “As the National Carrier, we have always made an effort to extend our assistance to communities in need. We strongly believe that medical facilities and expertise should be made accessible to people in all parts of the country. Therefore it is an exemplary initiative which invites other responsible organizations, governing bodies and entities to reach out and contribute towards elevating healthcare.”
Since its inception, the Shangri-La network has been continuously making efforts to drive social change through CSR initiatives. Sharing his thoughts on the project, Palinda Perera, CSR and Sustainability Manager of Shangri-La’s Hambantota Golf Resort and Spa, stated: “As a network, our CSR efforts have always focused on setting an example and being a source of inspiration that could drive social change. As a leading organization in the hospitality sector, we believe in reaching out and doing our part to uplift healthcare. We are glad to partner with SriLankan Airlines, as it is through such collective efforts that we can pave the path for the change that we seek and achieve the global goals for sustainable development.”
The medical camp was coordinated by SriLankan Airlines’ Medical Centre under the guidance of Dr. Anomi Jayasinghe, Group Medical Officer of SriLankan Airlines. Dr. Neeluka Abeysekera, Commanding Officer, SLA Base Hospital Katunayake, Dr. Nalin Goonesinghe, Consultant Ophthalmologist, Dr. Chula Goonesinghe, Senior Medical Officer at the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit of Sri Jayewardenepura Hospital, Dr. Bimal Dias, Senior Civil Aviation Inspector Aviation Medicine at the Civil Aviation Authority of Sri Lanka and Dr. Chandima Rodrigo, Medical Officer Anesthesia at General Hospital Negombo volunteered to extend their expertise and efforts towards the successful completion of the medical campaign.
SriLankan Airlines and Shangri-La network seek to conduct the event annually and continue with their endeavors to empower communities through joint charity initiatives of this scale.
