Sri Lanka reinforces ties with Palestine

Officials from the highest levels of government expressed their continuing support for the cause of the Palestinian state to mark the United Nations day for solidarity with Palestine.“The government of Sri Lanka has been consistent in its policy to stand for the inalienable rights of Palestinian people,” President Maithripala Sirisena said in a written statement.
In his statement, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said “Sri Lanka has always been a dear friend to the nation of Palestine, and I’ve consistently maintained a strong interest in moving forward.”At an event organised by the Sri Lanka Committee for Solidarity with Palestine on Monday, government officials and diplomats gathered at the Lakshman Kadirgamar Institute to condemn what they called the continued occupation of Palestine by Israel.
“For many years, Sri Lanka has worked very, very closely with the aspirations of the Palestinian people,” Speaker of the Parliament Karu Jayasuriya said. “The Sri Lankan government continues to be a strong advocate for the Palestinian cause,” he said.
The Speaker said Sri Lanka would keep representing Palestine on the international stage, so that it may become a “sovereign, independent, viable and united state … existing within secure and recognised borders, side by side and at peace with Israel.”
“I appreciate that here in Sri Lanka you are aware in following the catastrophic situation that is happening in Palestine,” said Zuhair Mohammad Hamdallah Zaid, the State of Palestine’s Ambassador to Sri Lanka.He said he extended “our grateful thanks to President Maithripala Sirisena, the Prime Minister, the Minister of Foreign Affairs, the government and the people of Sri Lanka for their active support.”
“We will never forget your support and generosity,” he said.Sri Lanka’s diplomatic relationship with Palestine extends decades. It was one of the first countries to recognise the Palestinian Liberation Organization, which opened an office in Colombo in 1975.
More recently, Sri Lanka voted in 2015 to raise the Palestinian flag at the UN General Assembly in New York.
