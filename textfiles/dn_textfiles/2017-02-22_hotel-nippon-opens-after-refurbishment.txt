Hotel Nippon opens after refurbishment

Hotel Nippon one of the oldest first five hotels in Sri Lanka at Slave Island Colombo 2 which is 130 years old opens after refurbishment tomorrow.
Started as a mansion apartment complex during Colonial era, Nippon is one of the oldest buildings in the vicinity is now open for business and has undergone a complete renovation, whilst maintaining the old exterior, the interior is all brand new, apart from a few ornamental and iconic pieces from its past.
Hotel Nippon has undergone a complete face-lift and change of Status. It has been given the care and attention that any Heritage property deserves.The investment towards its renovation has amounted close to Rs.400 million and it has taken two years for it.The building was first built as Manning Mansions; apartments for the British during their rule.
It was then converted to Hotel Polski briefly and then Hotel Nippon. Since the civil unrest in the 1980s and subsequent
war that followed, the hotel had fallen into a state of dormancy and mismanagement.
It is currently owned by 4 brothers, V. K. Chandrasena, V.K. Vasan, Dr.V.K. Valsan and the late V.K. Prasannan (all sons of the late Vethody Kumaran). Dr. V.K. Valsan spearheaded the renovation.
The hotel aims to cater to a completely new demographic and is equipped and designed to receive guests with various needs, including medical tourists, budget travelers looking for a more sophisticated level of accommodation, the business tourist for location of the hotel is very central and 10-15 minutes away from the Central Business district and other major venues and institutions in the City and it has 49 bedrooms.
They have maintained some key elements of the building’s history, like the 130-year-old Burma Teak Staircases that runs through two areas of the building and the 130-year-old Antique Seth Thomas grandfather clock. The iron beams that run through the skeletal structure of the building are all still in place since the time Nippon was first built as “Manning Mansions” and in fact have embossed seals on them that state their factory of origin - All from England during the mid-1800s (19th Century). All
though these are not visible right now, they are very much restored and still what keeps this magnificent building intact at its core.
“At the KAFÉ we want to focus on providing the best quality at the quoted price range. All our items (including our bread) are made in-house and we have two Chefs from Kerala, who provide Kerala Snacks and meals to ourgradually expanding menu,” Hotel official said.
The bamboo room has the first and only Authentic Kerala Cuisine menu in Sri Lanka and will be experimenting with a variation of continental, Sri Lankan and South Indian delicacies in time to come.
