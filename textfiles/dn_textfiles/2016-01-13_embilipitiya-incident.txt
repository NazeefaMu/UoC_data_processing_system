“According to the Police, the officers attached to the Embilipitiya Police had arrived at the scene at midnight on January 4 where a party was held following several telephone calls to the Police complaining that the loud noise was disturbing the neighbours.”
The minister said Police had stated that when they went to the house, several people who were drunk assaulted them
“Later the Embilipitiya Police HQI and the ASP had come to scene to resolve the issue and Sumith ran and jumped from the third floor to flee from the Police”.
He said Police claimed a civilian claimed seeing Sumith falling from the third floor.

Minister Ratnayake said according to the statements by those at the party, the Police officers who came at midnight had demanded liquor from the owner of the house.
However a heated argument had taken place and Police had assaulted the participants at the party. Meanwhile, police officers in civil attire too had joined them. He added that the people said that the Police officers pushed Sumith from the third floor during the conflict.
He added that Sumith was admitted to Embilipitiya Hospital and was transferred to Ratnapura Hospital where he died.
