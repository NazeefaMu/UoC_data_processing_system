The Colombo Commercial High Court issued an Enjoining Order today preventing well known tuition master and author Upul Shantha Sannasgala and Sanhinda Printers and Publishers from publishing, distributing and selling eleven books written by prominent academic in Sinhala Literature late Prof. Sucharitha Gamlath, until April 7. 
 Colombo High Court Judge Shiran Gunaratne made this order pursuant to a lawsuit filed by Shantha Pathmaperuma, widow of Prof. Gamlath over a claim of alleged copyright infringement.
Filing a lawsuit before Colombo Commercial High Court Judge Shiran Gunaratne, the plaintiff Shantha Pathmaperuma sought an injunction order to prevent two defendants from publishing, distributing and selling of eleven books written by late Prof. Gamlath.
The plaintiff complained the defendants had allegedly infringed the rights protected under Intellectual Property Act by an unauthorised publication, selling, distributing of eleven books.
The plaintiff informed Court the rights of these publications are owned by the plaintiff after the demise of Prof. Gamlath and maintained that the defendant party has no right to publish, distribute and sell them without her consent. 
Taking into consideration the facts, the defendants were issued notice applications for the Interim Injunction to appear in court on April 7.
Counsel Nuwan Bopage with Kenady Kodikara appeared for the plaintiff.
