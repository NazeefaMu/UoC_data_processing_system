SC grants leave to proceed with FR filed by medical student

The Supreme Court has granted leave to proceed with a Fundamental Rights petition filed by a medical student who obtained a MBBS degree from a Bangladesh university, seeking an order to quash the decision of Sri Lanka Medical Council (SLMC) to postpone the Examination for Registration to Practice Medicine in Sri Lanka (ERPM) which was scheduled to be held last May.
A three-judge-bench comprising Justice Eva Wanasundare, Justice Buvaneka Aluvihare and Justice Vijith Malalgoda fixed the petition for argument on December 4.
This petition had been filed by R.A. Sakshara Warananie Ranasinghe of Kelaniya.
The petitioner had cited Sri Lanka Medical Council, the Registrar of the SLMC, Health Minister Rajitha Senaratne and four others as respondents.
The petitioner stated that she having passed the G.C.E. (A/L) examination conducted by Department of Examinations in 2008, and having failed to secure a place locally proceeded to Bangladesh to follow the course of study therefore leading to the award of the degree of Bachelor of Medicine and Bachelor of Surgery (MBBS).
The petitioner stated that she returned to the island having graduated from the University of Science and Technology, Chittagong with a degree of Bachelor of Medicine and Bachelor of Surgery in July, 2015.
The petitioner stated that the Medical Ordinance provides that a foreign medical graduate can be registered by the SLMC if he or she has passed the special examination prescribed in that behalf by the SLMC.
The petitioner stated that the special examination is named the Examination for Registration to Practice Medicine (ERPM) in Sri Lanka, which was earlier known as the 'Act 16 Examination' held in terms of section 29(1) (b) (1v) (cc) of the Medical Ordinance.
The petitioner stated that on 04-05-2017, the second respondent posted an urgent notice on the official website of the SLMC that parts A and D of the Examination for ERPM which had been scheduled to be held on May 15, 18, and 22 were postponed until further notice.
