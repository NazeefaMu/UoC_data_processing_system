Udayanga’s properties debarred from sale

Colombo Fort Magistrate Lanka Jayaratne yesterday ordered the Land Registrars of Attanagalla and Colombo to stop the sale or the transfer of ownership of the properties in Dompe and Borella purchased in the name of former Ambassador to Russia, Udayanga Weeratunga.
The FCID sought court’s permission to issue an order directing the Land Registrars to prevent the identified properties from being sold to another party.
On last Thursday (18) the FCID informed the Colombo Fort Magistrate that it had traced properties worth Rs.94 million belonging to Udayanga Weeratunga.
The FCID informed court that they were able to trace seven acres valued at Rs.40 million in the Dompe area. A land and apartment in Colombo valued at Rs.25 million and Rs.29 million have also been traced.
The FCID revealed these facts after filing a further report regarding the alleged financial fraud that is alleged to have taken place in procuring seven MiG-27 ground attack craft for the Sri Lanka Air Force (SLAF).
