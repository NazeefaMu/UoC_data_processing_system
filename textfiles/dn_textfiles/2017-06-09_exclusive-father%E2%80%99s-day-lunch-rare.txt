An exclusive Father’s Day lunch at Rare

Rare at Residence will host an exclusive Father’s Day lunch in a celebration including the entire family on June 18 from 12pm-3.30pm.
A special menu will be prepared for the day, complete with multiple courses in true Rare fashion. The highlight of the menu will be having your children prepare and serve one of the dishes themselves, under the supervision of an expert chef.
Along with a unique lunch menu for the adults, there will also be two action stations for the kids.
Specially designed aprons for the occasion will be given to children who partake in the culinary activities of the day. There are also a host of entertaining surprise kids’ activities lined up to keep them busy while dad enjoys his meal and takes some much needed time-out.
Children under 12 years of age eat for free from the Special Kids’ Menu. There are also complimentary beers on offer for dad. Prior reservations are required, so reserve your spot in advance to avoid disappointment.
