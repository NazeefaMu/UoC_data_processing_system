Premier proposes increase in intake of students to Sri Lanka Law College

 
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe has released a proposal containing measures to increase the intake of students to the Sri Lanka Law College and to further develop legal studies in Sri Lanka.
The Premier released the proposal in response to a request made by the Sri Lanka Bar Association in his capacity as the National Policies and Economic Affairs Minister at the Prime Minister’s Office in Colombo, yesterday.
The proposal was made following an extensive study carried out by the Prime Minister’s Office, which revealed that the number of lawyers in Sri Lanka stands at a minimum, relative to the population of Sri Lanka.
The proposal suggests increasing the student intake to the Sri Lanka Law College in order to mitigate the prevailing shortage of lawyers in the country and ensured that this decision will pave the way for a society of more law-abiding citizens.
Furthermore the proposal deduced that the high cut off mark and the limited amount of opportunities vacated to peruse law studies as reasons for the current shortage of lawyers in Sri Lanka.
In 2016 statistics, it revealed that 8,432 students have lost the opportunity to enter in to the government law school due to the high cut off mark and even though 5,135 students have applied to follow the curriculum only 239 students have been qualified.
To mitigate this shortcoming the proposal suggested establishing more law schools, introducing new subjects related to law studies and conducting examinations under the direct supervision of the Sri Lanka Examinations Commissioner General and the Sri Lanka Constitutional Assembly to ensure the standard of law studies.
