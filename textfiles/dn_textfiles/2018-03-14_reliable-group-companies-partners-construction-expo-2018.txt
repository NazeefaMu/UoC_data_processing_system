Reliable Group of Companies partners with Construction Expo 2018

Reliable Group of Companies has join hands with Construction Expo 2018 as an official sponsor.
Reliable Group of Companies is happy to be an official sponsor for Construction Expo 2018 and to continue our patronage with LECS for the 11th year. Bringing together suppliers and service organizations in the building, construction, engineering and architecture industry, the “Construction Expo” will be held on June 29 - 30 and July 1, 2018 at the BMICH.
Sri Lanka is shaping up steadily over the last eight years. I believe that the country’s architectural designs in property and environmental developments, infra-structure, the quality of constructions and our heritage sites will provide Sri Lanka an uniqueness in the Asian Region. Every one of us, architects, engineers, professionals, builders and providers of products and services in the construction industry, has the opportunity to contribute to her uniqueness in designs and developments.
Reliable Group of Companies are committed to provide Reliable Propositions that will offer uniqueness to every building and to its purpose of architecture (designs) and engineering (developments).
"We focus on construction finishing products such as roofing, wall paneling, flooring, energy and water delivery pumps and many more. We find our propositions are highly appreciated and welcomed by many architects and professionals since they are very innovative, durable, technically compatible, internationally trendy and the solutions to many constructions related issues."
Held for the 7th consecutive year, the expo will once again showcase the best of what the industry has to offer. Highlighting the theme “Towards a Green Sri Lanka”, Construction Expo 2018 focuses on the green building evolution that is a fast evolving area of building practice.
Organized and managed by Lanka Exhibition and Conference Services (Pvt) Ltd in collaboration with the Ceylon Institute of Builders (CIOB), organizers hope it would be the platform in which the future development of the industry would take place.
