Budget brand easyHotel is planning to launch in Sri Lanka

easyHotel has announced plans to open branches in Sri Lanka and Iran, the Business Insider reported.
The “super budget” hotel, part of the group that owns budget airline easyJet, said on Monday it signed deals with British companies 3SV Limited and MHA Hatfield Limited for developments in the two countries, which will comprise a combination of new-build hotels and takeovers.
the company expects to open over 200 rooms in Sri Lanka, 100 of which should be ready by 2022.
“easyHotel has made good progress over the last year against its plans for the international expansion of the brand,” said Guy Parsons, CEO of easyHotel.
“I am pleased to announce a further extension of our franchise network, enabling us to establish the brand's presence in new territories where there is growing demand from cost conscious consumers for value hotel accommodation,” he said.
