SLIIT Walk 2017 helps raise funds for IT education in rural schools

SLIIT Walk 2017 was held for the 6th consecutive year, organized by the Student Interactive Society under the theme “Strides for Hope” and helped to bring together the student community and the staff, promoting the institute’s interactive culture.
The SLIIT Walk 2017 was a successful fund-raiser and helped to collect Rs. 1.16 million. The funds were raised with the specific objective of utilizing them to uplift the quality of life of underprivileged children in line with SLIIT’s vision as an educational institute, of disseminating knowledge to young people. This year’s sizable collection was used to upgrade the IT labs of two selected schools in Ratnapura and Badulla districts.
The school in Ratnapura is Amuhenkandha Sri Wimalasara Maha Vidyalaya, Eheliyagoda, with over 1000 students and classes from grade 1 to 13. The school currently has an IT Lab with only four working PCs but with sufficient space for 15 more PCs.
The other school that benefited is Konthahela Vidyalaya, Pattiyagedara, in Bandarawela with a student population of 288. The school has classes from grade 1 to 11 and more than 150 students learn IT facilitated by only one working PC. The contribution from the SLIIT Walk 2017 will enable the school to have much needed PCs, two fans, tables and chairs.
Students from both schools were unable to have an effective IT education due to the lack of IT facilities and the funds raised by the SLIIT Walk 2017 made a difference by uplifting the lives of these children. Empowering the youth in rural schools with IT education will enhance their employment prospects and help make their future brighter while supporting the government in its endeavour to reduce poverty and illiteracy in rural Sri Lanka.
Prof. Samantha Thalijjagoda, Dean of SLIIT Business School said “As an educational institute, SLIIT takes pride in empowering rural youth as a result of the annual walk that has raised a commendable amount of funds that would go a long way in upgrading IT education in two rural schools. This endeavour will also motivate our students to focus seriously on the need to help the community they live in and help to make them worthy citizens that benefit the nation.”
Vice President of Student Interactive Society, Mihiran Weerathunga said “SLIIT’s farsighted vision is to ensure that Sri Lanka benefits from Information Technology, Business Management and Engineering by promoting research and development as well as software services, nurturing IT ventures, thus ensuring a valuable pool of experts in the future.”
