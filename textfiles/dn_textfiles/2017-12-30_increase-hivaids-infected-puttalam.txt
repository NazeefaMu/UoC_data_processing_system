Increase in HIV/Aids infected in Puttalam

 The number of HIV/Aids infected patients in the Puttalam district had increased to 113 from 70, Dr. Nandika Rohan Amarajeewa of the Chilaw Hospital Socially Transmitted Diseases Unit said.
He said the number had incresed despite the clinics held in the Chilaw, Puttalam, Kalpitiya, Anamaduwa, and Marawila hospitals. He said the Unit was active 365 days of the year and any suspected patient could visit to the clinics and undergo a free investigation including blood tests to clear their doubts about contracting the diseases.
He said homosexual activities among males had been one of the causes that contributed towards spreading of the disease. Youngsters are more vulnerable to contract the disease via homosexual activity, he said.
