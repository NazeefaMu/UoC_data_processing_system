BASL lobby for speedy introduction of new constitution

The Bar Association of Sri Lanka (BASL) has decided to lobby for the expeditious introduction of a new Constitution by making representations to the President, Prime Minister and the Justice Minister requesting them to take early action in this regard, Association President Geoffrey Alagaratnem P.C. said.
He said the BASL decided to take this step since there had been an inordinate delay in introducing the new Constitution. He said a new Constitution was urgently required for the country since it would bring immense benefits to the country as regards law and order and peace.
BASL Secretary Amal Randeniya said their Association had already made representations to the Parliamentary Select Committee.
