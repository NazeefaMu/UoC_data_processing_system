Pathway to Good Governance

One of the founding principles on which the vibrant socio-political revolution that took place on January 8, 2015 was based on the notion of nation building and the promise of building a state on the principles of one nation, one country imbibing equal citizens with access to equal opportunities. Many look at building the nation i.e. nation building commonly in terms of ethnic lines where national integration is purely based on bridging the differences which exists (due to a host of socio-political and economic reasons) between ethnicities in multi ethnic societies. But it has to be questioned whether such a narrow view of nation building can suffice given the context we inhabit now.
The Rajapaksa regime which was in power from 2009 to 2015 did have a golden opportunity to bring about national reconciliation and construct a strong nation state especially after of the war which ravaged the country for over 30 years. But the then ruling regime willfully failed to do function in any constructive manner which would have brought about nation building.
It spread violence and fear within the society through false ethnic propaganda which led to violent clashes between the Sinhalese and the Muslims like in Aluthgama. It spread terror through extra judicial abductions by spreading white van terrorism. It promoted nepotism, corruption, and ethno nationalism (by allowing organisations like the Bodhu Bala Sena and the Ravana Balakaya among many others) which severely fractured the already broken and fractured social kaleidoscope of Sri Lanka.
Rajapaksa led regime
One of the most destructive things done to Sri Lanka by the previous Rajapaksa led regime was the gross manipulation of the fragile under developed political culture of Sri Lanka which lacked and still lacks a cohesive nature. The Rajapaksha’s brought about a “tribal” extremely male dominated patriarchal system of governance where people were ideologically manipulated by the institutional state apparatuses to rally around a “strong” ruler and his clan.
The ruler was portrayed as a king and his family as saviours of the nation from what they termed and identified as neo-colonial political influences. Accordingly, fear mongering, the threat of imminent western invasions, inquiries into alleged war crimes and the threat of another ethnic upheaval was enough to keep the Sinhalese Buddhist majority under check. By manipulating this political climate, corruption and terror became wide spread but those who spoke against them were shown as unpatriotic or either as western NGO agents working on destabilizing the nation state under the auspices of “dollars”.
But it became evident that corruption done under such fear mongering could not survive for long as Sri Lanka still has reminiscences of democracy left.
Thus, all these combined negativities of the previous regime paved the way to bring about the political revolution which took place on January 8, 2015 with the election of a new President and the appointment of a new government on the promise of good governance.
Even after the conclusion of the parliamentary elections in 2015, the UNP which secured a victory joined hands with the SLFP for the first time in the history creating a new political culture within Sri Lanka with the promise of bringing about sustainable development through constructing (or it is fair to say reconstructing) the Sri Lankan nation state. Before going into specifics, I believe that it is important to understand the theoretical formulations behind what these concepts mean.
Politics of nationalism
Before going on the concept of national integration, let me explain the meaning of the term nation. The term nation tends to be used with little precision and is often used interchangeably with terms such as the state, country, ethnic group and race. Andrew Heywood in his book ‘politics’ states that there is a difficulty in defining the term nation as it comprises a mixture of objective and subjective features, a blend of cultural and political characteristics. In objective terms nations are cultural entities: groups of people who speak the same language, have the same religion, and are bound by a shared past, and so on. Such factors undoubtedly shape the politics of nationalism.
This form of the definition of the nation then is problematic because it will lead to a breaking up of the state on cultural lines such as the case was in Sri Lanka and many other South Asian states. This in a sense leads us to forming a second definition of the term nation based on Subjective terms. Again as Heywood points out, the nation is a psycho-political construct.
What sets a nation apart from any other group of collectivity is that its members regard themselves to be a nation. What does this mean? A nation, in this sense, perceive itself to be a distinctive political community. This is what distinguishes a nation from an ethnic group. An ethnic group undoubtedly possess a communal identity and a sense of cultural pride, but unlike a nation, it lacks collective political aspirations.
These aspirations have traditionally taken the form of the quest for, or however, they may consist of a desire to achieve a measure of autonomy, perhaps as part of a federation or confederation of states.
It becomes clear from this discussion that two opposing descriptions for the term nation exists.While one works on cultural elements while the other works on political aspirations. But when analyzed critically, one can clearly see that cultural nationalism or trying to build up a nation on cultural terms can result in deadly outcomes as was the case in Sri Lanka and other South Asian States.
Collective memories and traditions
This notion which states the nation to be essentially an ethnic or cultural entity is considered to be the primary concept of the nation. This notion can be traced back to the work of 18th Century German writers like Herder and Fichte. Herder emphasizes that the innate character of each national group was determined by its natural environment, climate, physical geography, working habits, attitudes and creative propensities of a people.
Above everything else, he made emphasis on the importance of language which he believed was the embodiment of a people’s distinctive traditions and historical memories. Each nation reveals itself in songs, myths and legends which proves a nation as its source of creativity. The nation then is built on collective memories and traditions instead of an overtly political quest for statehood where national and ethnic identities overlap. Cultural nations tend to view themselves as exclusive ethnic groups where the membership of the nation is seem to derive not out of a political allegiance, voluntarily undertaken, but from an ethnic identity that has somehow been inherited.
The view that nations are essentially political entities emphasizes civic loyalties and political allegiances rather than on a common cultural identity. This notion which shows the people bound together primarily by a notion of shared citizenship regardless of their cultural and ethnic background can be traced back to the writings of Jean Jacques Rousseau. His writings which stressed on a general will as well as popular sovereignty are regarded as the founding seeds of looking at the nation as political communities. The idea that nations are political and not ethnic communities has been supported by a number of theories of nationalism.
The idea that nations are political, not ethnic, communities has been supported by a number of theories of nationalism. Eric Hobsbawm (1983) for instance highlighted the degree to which nations are invented traditions. Rather than accepting that modern nations have developed out of long-established ethnic communities, Hobsbawm argued that a belief in historical continuity and cultural purity was invariably a myth, and , what is more, a myth created by nationalism itself. In this view, nationalism creates nations, not the other way round.
A widespread consciousness of nationhood did not for example develop until the late nineteenth century, perhaps fashioned by the invention of national anthems and national flags, and the extension of primary education. Certainly, the idea of a mother tongue passed down from generation to generation and embodying national culture is highly questionable. In reality, languages live and grow as each generation adapts the language to its own distinctive needs and circumstances.
National identity
Moreover, it can be argued that the notion of a national language is an absurdity as it is extremely political in a serious sense. Benedict Anderson (1983) also portrayed the modern nation as an artifact, in his case as an imagined community. Anderson pointed out that nations exist more as mental images that as genuine communities which require a level of face to face interaction to sustain the notion of a common identity. Within nations, individuals only ever meet a tiny proportion of those with whom they supposedly share a national identity. If nations exist, they exist as imagined artifices, constructed for us through education, the mass media and a process of political socialization.
A political nation clearly then is one where citizenship has greater political significance than ethnic identity. Though there are many contentious political problems within USA, it has been described as a prime example of a political nation.As a land of immigrants, the USA has a distinctively multiethnic and multicultural character, which makes it impossible for it to construct a national identity on the basis of a shared culture and historical tires. Instead a sense of American nationhood has been consciously developed through the educational system, and through the cultivation of respect for a set of common values, notably those outlined in the declaration of independence and the US Constitution. Similarly French national identity is closely linked to the traditions and principles of the 1789 French revolution.
What such nations have in common is that, in theory, they were founded upon a voluntary acceptance of a common set of principles or goals, as opposed to an existing cultural identity. It is sometimes argued that the style of nationalism which develops in such societies is typically tolerant and democratic. If a nation is primarily a political entity, it is an inclusive group, in that membership is not restricted to those who fulfill particular language, religious, ethnic or suchlike criteria. As we can see, a political nation is always preferred over a cultural nation. In a way a political nation encompasses a cultural nation because culture will exist there and the outlook will be that of a salad bowl.
National integration
The question then is as to how people in actuality can build up a modern nation state. From the time of the Polis in ancient Greece to the modern nation state the fundamental political question has remained the same and that is as to how one can build up a nation building. Thus in this context various questions like what does the project of national integration entail? What are the means whereby states might achieve this end? Which of these means would enable states to achieve integration without counterproductive consequences? What are the ethical limits to the desirability of this goal? Thus, this becomes a very difficult concept to define as well as pin point. According to Swarna Rajgopalan three definitions of integration can be identified as follows.
1. Integration is a process whereby the cooperation over time of the several creates a more or less singular entity that in turn facilitates further action and change and in which the several repose their allegiance to a greater of lesser degree.
2. Integration is the state’s goal of realizing its constitutional self-image
3. Integration is a process of coming together in attitude, memory, and interest.
This process derives from and contributes to the development of constitutive individuals, groups, and units. The state bears the primary responsibility for directing the integrative process, which may involve a variety of relationships among the constituent groups and between those constituents and the collective
Myron Weiner one of the earliest contributors to the subject of national integration in the field of social science in his Political Integration and Political Development provided five definitions of the term integration focusing on the functional dimensions and usages attached to it.
Weiner defines national integration as a process of bringing together culturally and socially discrete groups into a single territorial unit and the establishment of a national identity and recognized it as a key issue to be tackled by the countries with pluralistic social order and offers public policy strategies for the achievement of national integration for those societies, namely the (a) the elimination of the distinctive cultural traits of minority communities into some kind of a national culture, usually that of the dominant cultural group and (b) the establishment of national loyalties without eliminating subordinate cultures. According to Weiner the first strategy is generally referred to as the policy of assimilationist and the second as the policy of unity in diversity.
According to this presentation by Myron Weiner, national integration is a process dealing with the ethnic diversity in society. Thus, there are two strategies to achieve it (In this light National integration is a means of community building which has to take place within a state for it to function effectively as a cohesive political unit and is an essential aspect of democratic state building. What is interesting is that the national integration efforts are conducted essentially in two means by the use of the policies of assimilation and integration.
Accordingly assimilation can be viewed as a political project which is attempts to eliminate distinctive cultural elements belonging to minority communities into some kind of national culture, usually that of the dominant cultural group.” Assimilation is a rigid homogenizing process, a where boundaries are reduced and people are re-socialized. In such an instance a minority group loses its traditional identity and has to acquire a new identity which generally belongs to the dominant group.
Integration is a much more politically correct concept. It generally means the establishment of a closer interdependence between the parts of a living organism or between the members of the society. It allows and encourages diversity and the maintenance of group boundaries. With integration, ethnic groups can remain within their own boundaries with autonomy where they will be able to maintain their own distinct cultural traits and boundaries while they get an equal opportunity to participate in the larger and the essential process of production, distribution and government.
Thus when we look at this above discussion, it becomes clear that Sri Lanka from the time of British Colonialism has followed a policy of divide and rule where a cultural nation working along the lines of assimilationist policies were favored over a political nation working on the means of integration.
Historical examples
There are some prime historical examples to validate this fact. The breaking up of the Ceylon National Congress in the 1940’s, the official language act of 1956, giving prominence to Buddhism in the constitution of 1972 and 1978, the riots which took place during the Black July and the recent violence against the Muslims are cases in points. The problem here lies in the very fact of the erosion of the minority cultural traits which leads up to definite discrimination and extreme marginalization. Even if they adapt and embrace the dominant cultural traits, fair participation within that dominant cultural nexus will be far restricted and controlled. What then follows is resistance against such discrimination which can escalate upto conflicts at various levels which was quite substantially visible before the political revolution which took place in 2015 as the previous Rajapaksa regime did everything contrary to the accepted political means of constructing a nation.
Their notion of the nation state was created on what one would term in a Janus manner where they took selective historical items to create the future of the country to serve their political needs.
This government which was the creation of the UNP inherited a state which is extremely fractured and broken. It was politically stunted and economically disabled. Tensions were ripe and despite the war being over there was no democracy or rule by law which made nation building a mere dream reduced to fancy rhetoric. The rhetoric and the dominant discourses which emanated from the propaganda of the previous regime suited a certain section of the population and the ruling elites. But it definitely did not serve the purpose for the “others”.
When you look at the present political climate within Sri Lankait becomes clear then, that the present government within Sri Lanka is on the proper path to construct a nation state. One must remember that these serious errors in governance and the inherent weaknesses of the political culture cannot be rectified or replaced within a short period of time. In order to do that, it is necessary that the foundations are laid and that it is built on over a period of time to bring about a vibrant new political culture.
As stated before national integration cannot be merely achieved by finding a solution to the ethnic issue alone. It requires that the state be free from corruption, that rule of law is established and democracy strengthened by establishing constitutionalism and a clear cut system of checks and balances.
In this light, the present government brought about some fundamental changes to bring back the lost glory of democracy, constitutionalism, rule of law and the independence of the judiciary. The press of the state is largely free from the previous harassments it received and the judiciary is largely free from political influence it had to face earlier. The politicization of the public service too was largely reduced with the establishment of the independent commissions which became operational.
The 19th constitutional amendment reduced the term of the President to five years from six and it again specifically stated that the President of the state can be only elected twice. It further reduced the power of the President by not allowing him to dissolve parliament until four years pass after a parliamentary election. These of course are strong measures to protect democracy which will curtail the chances of authoritarianism coming into the state again.
In addition to these, for the first time in the history of Sri Lanka, the leader of the opposition hails from the Tamil’s and the two major parties came together to form a unity government which actually was regarded by many as the dawn of a new political climate and a culture.
A new constitution with a wider socio-political philosophy is being drafted with policies promoting integration as opposed to assimilation which will definitely move the state towards the ultimate goal of one nation one country imbibing equal citizens who have access to equal opportunities. It is in these lines that the lands occupied by various parties in the North and East are slowly being released to its rightful owners and new development projects are brought to the country to generate employment and macroeconomic stability within the state.
One must remember that all these things will only serve as the mere foundations and that they have to be built up with time in order to totally revamp the corrupt political culture of this state. It will obviously take time. But we must salute this current government for the initiatives it has taken so far to build a political nation along integrationist lines which gives us citizens hope for the future.
