WB unaware of potential loss in bond case

The World Bank(WB) has said that they are not aware of international best practices to accurately calculate the potential loss in the case of past bond auction.
World Bank country Director Idah Pswarayi – Riddihough in a letter to the Secretary to the Prime Minister Saman Ekanayake has stressed that quantifying the loss accurately would require knowledge of the actual cost of the bond placement under non competitive allocation (a necessary counterfactual). “In our view that counterfactual cannot be accurately calculated on an expost basis as it depends on the market conditions on the auction date,” she has said in her letter to Ekanayake.
“The World Bank hopes to effectively and immediately contribute to the design of auction rules and practices for issuing government debt in the upcoming joint mission with the IMF, the letter said.
“The targeted mission will be further complemented with a range of technical assistance activities to support development of the government bond market and the capital market at large including the formulation of Medium Term Debt Management Strategy,” the letter added.
