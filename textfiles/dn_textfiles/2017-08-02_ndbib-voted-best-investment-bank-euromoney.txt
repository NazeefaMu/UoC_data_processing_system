NDBIB voted Best Investment Bank by Euromoney

Repeating their feat for the sixth consecutive year, NDB Investment Bank was once again crowned as ‘Sri Lanka’s Best Investment Bank 2017’ by the prestigious Euromoney Magazine.
Following a record-breaking year in 2015, NDBIB managed to raise Rs 48 billion in 2016 in both debt and equity capital despite subdued market conditions; the second highest in terms of funds raised during a given year in the history of NDBIB. The performance assumed greater significance in light of the policy uncertainties in Sri Lanka and volatile global political events. NDBIB continued its vigorous quest for innovation, by introducing several new structures and products to the Sri Lankan Capital Markets. A case in point is the maiden introduction of a Cornerstone Tranche for an IPO in Sri Lanka in line with best practices in regional markets. Darshan Perera, CEO of NDBIB said, “Being awarded as the best in the country at what we do for six consecutive years is no small achievement. NDBIB has continuously sought out new challenges and avenues to express ourselves as the pioneers of innovation in the local capital market.”
