Mother held for starving her children

A mother of three was taken into custody by Potuvil Police after her children had come to the police station asking for food as they claimed to have been starving for several days.
Potuvil Police Inspector Nishantha Kumarasinghe had taken immediate steps to provide food and beverages to the children. Two of the children are boys, 14 and 13, and the youngest is a seven-year-old girl.
According to the police, the father had gone for foreign employment and the mother was not taking care of her children properly.
The children told police that another person who visits the mother daily is taking care of the mother but does not provide them food. The mother was remanded until December 12 after she was produced before the Potuvil Magistrate’s Court by Potuvil Police.
The children were handed over to their uncle under the custodian of the Child Protection Authority. Magistrate Mohamed Rafee further ordered the police to produce the children before the Potuvil Magistrate’s Court on December 12.
Police are investigating.
