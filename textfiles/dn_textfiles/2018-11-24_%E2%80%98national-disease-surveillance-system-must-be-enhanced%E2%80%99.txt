‘National disease surveillance system must be enhanced’

Sri Lanka must prevent use of biological agents, Sri Lanka Permanent Representative in Geneva Ambassador A.L.A. Azeez said.
He was addressing the International Seminar convened by the Geneva Centre for Security Policy (GCSP) and the Implementation Support Unit (ISU) of the Biological Weapons Convention (BWC) on 'the importance of disease surveillance and alert mechanisms: lessons for the BWC’on November 20.
The Seminar focused on the Article 7 of the Biological Weapons Convention (BWC) that accentuates the importance of technical assistance and international cooperation to respond effectively to epidemics involving bio-agents.
Ambassador Azeez explained the existing disease surveillance mechanism in Sri Lanka. He said it comprises a wide range of medical and administrative networks including at national, provincial, and district levels. He also drew attention to the role and contribution of hospitals and primary healthcare units in addressing the challenge.
“Continuing work on strengthening the system involved further updating of policies and programmes to empower the National Disease Surveillance System is a part of an integrated health-security mechanism,” he said.
He said Sri Lanka has an exemplary platform which could be further built on to be more effective in meeting new and emerging challenges and unanticipated outbreaks of epidemics, with the active support of all stakeholders.
The need for a web-based surveillance system that facilitates heightened surveillance by integrating hospitals at all levels and effective pursuit of a meaningful public-private partnership, which could enhance the feeding of data into the central database, was highlighted at this forum. It would go a long way in ensuring efficacious responses to future challenges.
WHO scientist Prof. Maurizio Barbeschi appreciated Sri Lanka’s system of disease surveillance, It provided an appropriate base to be further worked on as a model, he said.
Health Security experts representing Japan, Russia and South Korea, and regional and international organisations and the private sector made presentations on the varied aspects of disease surveillance.
