A journey of soul search,

He is widely known as Rohantha Reggae. Hailing from a little town nestled in the chilly Nuwara Eliya, Rohantha was studying for his A/Ls in Mathematics stream at St. Anthony’s College in Kandy when an idea urged him to rediscover his aspirations.
This was an idea that would take him on a long winding journey for several decades, across the island and beyond the seven seas.
“I wanted to explore various subjects and discover a means to heal people. Sri Lanka is a tropical island and it draws a lot of people with spiritual energy. I became interested in music and started listening to different genres like pop, jazz, rock and reggae. And little by little I was drawn to Reggae, to the life story of Bob Marley and their way of life. Reggae is like a ladder, where you can’t see its end. So I decided to learn reggae music, make it popular in my home country and compose my own songs.”
During the many years of self-studying, experimenting and research, Rohantha kept tabs on the local Reggae scene and when he realized that authentic music has yet to reach the local fans, he decided to step forward with his own style of Reggae - marking the birth of Rohantha Reggae.
With an ad-hoc band he groomed himself and an unwavering passion for music, Rohantha made his debut appearance gaining recognition and popularity following his first performance. Reigniting the spark of soul search, he once set off on a quest for the origins of music, and continued traveling to many countries visiting the original homes of the world’s top musicians including Mozart.
While studying and experimenting the scope of music, Rohantha continued his higher education in Engineering. A long journey has seen to him performing at every university in Sri Lanka, in small towns and big cities, street corners as well as glitzy clubs - with the same inimitable passion to share the spirit of music.
An artiste of one of a kind calibre, Rohantha has rediscovered music as a lifestyle and a spiritually uplifting experience, rather than a vocational education. He has travelled far and wide cross borders from the orient to the west, gaining deep insight into multifarious cultures and music styles while learning different languages. This comprehensive experience and knowhow led him to compose songs incorporating eclectic language phrases, transcending time, space as well as boundaries to spread his message loud and clear.
Rohantha released his debut album in 2000, and since then he has released scores of songs warmly embraced by his fans across the globe. He believes that through reggae music he has spiritually become closer to nature, and can feel the pulse of people.
Expressing his views on the distinctive Rasta appearance he said, “I have met Rishis (sages) and Sadhus (ascetic persons) when I travelled to Rishikesh and Himachal areas in northern India. It was a sight to behold, these holy men wearing dreadlocks, just like the Rastafarians from Jamaica. Dreadlocks do not belong to one country, ethnicity or religion, but it’s a universal attribute. Rastafari was originally a religion, a culture and a way of life, which later became popular through Bob Marley and his reggae influence across the globe. Rastas love nature and everything about humanity.
They live by the two words - ‘Love and Respect’ and Reggae is about ‘One Love’. It has become my mission to inspire many people, across generations, from the richest to the poorest.”
As a composer, lyricist, musician and researcher - Rohantha says he is closer to realizing his ultimate dream. After embarking on a world tour, he said he is finally prepared to visit Kingston, Jamaica - the very town which nestles the residence of the timeless legend - Bob Marley. Rohantha has fondly named his own residence as ‘Kingston’ long ago with a strong desire to visit the legendary Bob Marley’s home in future.
Before commencing his world tour, Rohantha was back in the island to perform for his fans in the commercial capital.
Joining the Colombo Hippie Market held in Kolamba Kamatha, BMICH Recently, Rohantha performed with true zest and passion kindling the spirit of reggae to the delight of the crowds.
“While touring the country, Avi and the Hippie Market team approached me and we had a discussion to hold special reggae sessions. I’ve been to Hippie Markets in Goa, San Francisco and some European countries.
I was really excited to join the local Hippie Market and it’s really nice to see the especially the young generation embracing the world cultures. So this is like a learning experience for them, to learn music, cultures and lifestyles of a bygone era. And there’s also a special coincidence, I performed once at a Hippie Market in Goa on March 26, 2012, and here I find myself performing again on 26th March 2017 at a Hippie Market in Colombo. This is called positive vibrations.”
Concluding his thoughts Rohantha said that he feels like the tiny seed he planted decades ago has grown into a soaring tree. And if anyone aspires for something, they should set aside the little doubts and hesitations and pursue their dreams with strong determination.
