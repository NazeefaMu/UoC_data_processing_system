ITAK official newspaper Sudhandiran re-launched

The official newspaper of the Ilankai Thamil Arasu Kachchi (ITAK) which had stopped printing nearly 35 years ago, started printing the newspaper as the ‘Pudiya Sudhandiran’ on Tuesday (14), in Trincomalee.
The ITAK which established itself as a party in 1949, started a newspaper titled “Sudhandiran” in 1960, as a means to propagate its ideology amongst the people.
The paper was in print until 1983. During Black July riots of 1983, its head office in Jaffna was destroyed and they stopped printing due to the ethnic war that followed thereafter.
The paper now re-launched as the new Sudhandiran, had its first copy handed over to TNA Trincomalee District MP, K. Thurairathnasingham by TNA Trincomalee District Organizer and former Eastern Provincial Council Education Minister, S. Thandaiyuthapani at the TNA office in Trincomalee.
The paper will be printed monthly. The event had the participation of provincial politicians and members of the TNA.
