Political hand behind IUSF protest: Sagala

The Front-line Party is behind the unruly protests of the Inter University Students Federation (IUSF), Law and Order Minister Sagala Rathnayake said.
He said a political hand operated behind the scene where the students stormed into the Health Ministry building. He was addressing a press conference at Sirikotha yesterday.
“The undergraduates must be wise enough not to fall prey to the narrow minded motives of political parties,” he said.
