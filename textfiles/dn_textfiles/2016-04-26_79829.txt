SP thrash NCP in innings win

Southern Province (SP) piled up a commanding first innings score of 343 all out, well supported by Amindu Udara (98) and Navidu Nirmal (41) which earned them an innings and 15-run victory over North Central Province (NCP) in their Super U19 Provincial tournament match concluded at the Surrey Ground, Maggona yesterday. NCP scored 147 for the firs innings and in their follow on they were skittled out for 181 with Asela Sigera capturing 6/94.
Despite a sparkling second innings knock of 118 by Vishad de Silva of Western Province Central (WPC), their dismal first innings total resulted a first innings defeat at the hands of North Western Province (NWP) at the Colts ground.
Damitha Silva returned fine bowling figures of 5/115 to restrict WPC to 320 total in their second innings. At close NWP were struggling at 35/5 with Vimukthi Kulatunga (3/12) and N. Wanniarachchi (2/9) doing the damage to NWP batting line up.
Western Province -North registered a six wicket win over Uva Province while Western Province - South recorded a first innings win over Eastern Province.
