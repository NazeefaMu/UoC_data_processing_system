JVP to bring no confidence motion against Faizer Mustapha

The JVP will bring a no confidence motion in Parliament against Local Government and Provincial Councils Minister Faizer Mustapha for snatching away the voting right of the people by issuing a wrong gazette notification regarding the Local Government Elections, said JVP Publicity Secretary Vijitha Herath.
Addressing a Press Conference held at the JVP head office in Pelawatta yesterday, Herath said the gazette notification on the Local Government Elections was issued in February.The writ petition against the delimitation gazette was filed in November.
The question was why the writ petition was filed after nine months. The role of the appeal court and its limitations were known to Minister Faizer Mustapha.
Being a Presidents Council he should have observed the deficiencies in the gazette notification before issuing it. It did not happen due to a need for a conspiracy to postpone elections, alleged Vijitha Herath.
“It was the Minister himself who knew the shortcomings in the gazette notification. The ordinary public were unaware of such shortcomings. As such we believe that the Minister himself would have given the necessary tips to the litigants who filed the writ petition.
Without filing the petition at the very outset they would have waited till the time arrives to announce the election to file it on the compulsion of the government itself”, said Vijitha Herath.
“This clearly proved an intention to postpone the election. As such, he is not fit to hold the post of Minister any more. Therefore, he should be removed from the post forthwith. But the President will not remove him because he is catering to the needs of the SLFP including the President. As such, we will bring a no confidence motion against him”, said Vijitha Herath.
