Dairy farmers’ payments settled: Zoysa

Fisheries, Aquatic Resources Development and Rural Economic Affairs Minister Vijith Vijayamuni Zoysa said arrears valued at Rs. 700 million owed to dairy farmers, had been paid by yesterday.
The payment for milk purchases after May 31 would be paid within the next two months, he added.
Addressing a media briefing held in Colombo yesterday, the minister said that the dairy farmers had numerous issues when he took over this ministry.
“We have developed an action plan to address all issues pertaining to the dairy industry and requested for a time period of two months to solve them. It was wrong of dairy farmers to demonstrate in front of the ministry. Milco had a monthly turnover of only Rs.27 million when I took over the ministry; it has now risen to Rs. 58 million due to efficient work and correct decisions,” he said.
“Fresh milk collected from dairy farmers was wasted in the past. I prevented that wastage and hence, milk purchased from farmers are currently utilised for the dairy products. That is why Milco is currently earning profits,” Minister Zoysa added.
He said multinational companies were producing ice cream with chemical compounds and artificial additives, without using fresh milk.
“Only Highland uses fresh milk for their dairy products. Their yogurt has a shelf life of 14 days, whereas other yogurts, which have chemical additives in them, have shelf lives up to one month,” the minister said.
“We have a plan to stop the import of dry fish, canned fish, chicken and eggs which could be produced here and are negotiating with the relevant parties to provide fresh milk packets to schoolchildren as well as eggs to pregnant mothers,” he added.
Minister Zoysa further said that Indian fishermen using outdated and banned methods were catching fish worth Rs. 6 billion in Sri Lankan waters, adding that it was destroying the country’s marine resources.
“We will take immediate measures in order to avert this situation. The Indian Government is currently directing their fisherman to use better and legal fishing methods,” he said.
