Bring the miscreants to book
I thank the European Union and many other countries for their concern over the recent wave of mob attacks on mosques and Muslim business establishments in the country. It is appreciable the foreign envoys of the European Union, the Netherlands, Australia, Norway, Switzerland, South Africa and Canada have urged the Government to take swift action to halt these incidents and arrest the miscreants who are plunged to disturb the peace and sabotage the reconciliation process the Sirisena –Wickremesinghe government has set in motion.
Despite several mob attacks on Muslim mosques and business establishments by the BBS, it is astonishing the Government is still on the slumbering state without taking any action on the perpetrators. It is absurd and lamentable the Government waited until the foreign countries have taken their task to urge it to take action for the chaotic rabble rousers in the country.
The good governance government is committed to protecting the fundamental and human rights of every citizen of this country. It may be a Buddhist, Muslim, Hindu or Christian. Everybody should have his freedom of living, following a religion and worshipping one’s own god. Disgracing and belittling a God or place of worship is unethical and illegal of creating hatred and tension among people of different faiths. We condemn such despicable and heinous acts whoever is responsible for them.
In addition, we are committed to thanking the Bar Association of Sri Lanka for calling upon the IGP, Attorney General and the Government to take immediate action to arrest the increasing trend of attacks against the Muslim community.
However, we never forget to thank Anura Kumara Dissanayaka for his recent speech in parliament raising the issue of the racial hatred against the Muslims unleashed by the BBS.
