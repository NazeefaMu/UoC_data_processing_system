ComBank draws crowds at ‘Kedella’, Auto Vision motor show

Banks can help make dreams come true, a point underscored by the Commercial Bank of Ceylon through its participation this month in two popular public events the ‘Kedella’ Living in Style exhibition and the Auto Vision Motor Show, both at the BMICH.
The Commercial Bank stalls at these two events drew large crowds interested in the many loan schemes available for housing and the bank’s attractive leasing products for motor vehicles. Pictured here are the Commercial Bank stalls at ‘Kedella’ (above) and the Auto Vision Motor Show.
