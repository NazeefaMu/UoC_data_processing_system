Of all wishes Akankha Sutta

On one occasion the Blessed One was staying near Savatthi in Jeta’s Grove, Anathapindika’s monastery. There he addressed the monks, “Monks!”
“Yes, lord,” the monks responded.
The Blessed One said: “Monks, dwell consummate in virtue, consummate in terms of the Patimokkha. Dwell restrained in accordance with the Patimokkha, consummate in your behavior and sphere of activity. Train yourselves, having undertaken the training rules, seeing danger in the slightest faults.
“If a monk would wish, ‘May I be dear and pleasing to my fellows in the holy life, respected by and inspiring to them,’ then he should be one who brings the precepts to perfection, who is committed to inner tranquillity of awareness, who does not neglect jhana, who is endowed with insight, and who frequents empty dwellings.
“If a monk would wish, ‘May I be someone who receives robes, almsfood, lodgings, and medical requisites for curing the sick,’ then he should be one who brings the precepts to perfection, who is committed to inner tranquillity of awareness, who does not neglect jhana, who is endowed with insight, and who frequents empty dwellings.
“If a monk would wish, ‘Whatever I use or consume in terms of robes, almsfood, lodgings, and medical requisites for curing the sick, may that be of great fruit, of great benefit to those who provided them,’ then he should be one who brings the precepts to perfection, who is committed to inner tranquillity of awareness, who does not neglect jhana, who is endowed with insight, and who frequents empty dwellings.
“If a monk would wish, ‘When my kinsmen and relatives who have died and passed away recollect me with brightened minds, may it be of great fruit, of great benefit,’ then he should be one who brings the precepts to perfection, who is committed to inner tranquility of awareness, who does not neglect jhana, who is endowed with insight, and who frequents empty dwellings.
“If a monk would wish, ‘May I be content with whatever robes, almsfood, lodgings, and medical requisites for curing the sick are available,’ then he should be one who brings the precepts to perfection, who is committed to inner tranquillity of awareness, who does not neglect jhana, who is endowed with insight, and who frequents empty dwellings.
“If a monk would wish, ‘May I be resistant to cold, heat, hunger, and thirst; to the touch of gadflies and mosquitoes, wind and sun and creeping things; to abusive, hurtful language; to bodily feelings that, when they arise, are painful, sharp, stabbing, fierce, distasteful, deadly,’ then he should be one who brings the precepts to perfection, who is committed to inner tranquillity of awareness, who does not neglect jhana, who is endowed with insight, and who frequents empty dwellings.
“If a monk would wish, ‘May I overcome displeasure, and not be overcome by displeasure. May I dwell conquering again and again any displeasure that has arisen,’ then he should be one who brings the precepts to perfection, who is committed to inner tranquillity of awareness, who does not neglect jhana, who is endowed with insight, and who frequents empty dwellings.
“If a monk would wish, ‘May I overcome fear and dread, and not be overcome by fear and dread. May I dwell conquering again and again any fear and dread that have arisen,’ then he should be one who brings the precepts to perfection, who is committed to inner tranquillity of awareness, who does not neglect jhana, who is endowed with insight, and who frequents empty dwellings.
“If a monk would wish, ‘May I attain — whenever I want, without strain, without difficulty — the four jhanas that are heightened mental states, pleasant abidings in the here-and-now,’ then he should be one who brings the precepts to perfection, who is committed to inner tranquillity of awareness, who does not neglect jhana, who is endowed with insight, and who frequents empty dwellings.
“If a monk would wish, ‘May I — with the ending of mental fermentations — remain in the fermentation-free awareness-release and discernment-release, having directly known and realized them for myself in the here-and-now,’ then he should be one who brings the precepts to perfection, who is committed to inner tranquillity of awareness, who does not neglect jhana, who is endowed with insight, and who frequents empty dwellings.
“Monks, dwell consummate in virtue, consummate in terms of the Patimokkha. Dwell restrained in accordance with the Patimokkha, consummate in your behavior and sphere of activity. Train yourselves, having undertaken the training rules, seeing danger in the slightest faults,” thus was it said.
