Billy Ray Cyrus shoots down rumours about Miley’s marriage

Singer-songwriter Billy Ray Cyrus has shot down speculations that his daughter Miley Cyrus had gotten married to her fiance Liam Hemsworth, and urged her fans not to jump the gun.
Billy, 55, took to Instagram recently to quell the speculations.
He posted a screenshot of a digital camera with an image of beaming Miley, 24, on the screen. He captioned the image: “I’m so happy...you are happy Miley Cyrus.”
But it was Miley’s attire which got her fans talking since the singer and actress was clad in a floaty white dress. Fans were quick to wonder if she had tied the knot with her Hemsworth.
Billy then took to the photo-sharing site to repost the image and add a new message, which stated: “Whoa! Don’t jump the gun. Been at work Still The King Glad to see so many love Miley Cyrus the same as I do #happy.”
