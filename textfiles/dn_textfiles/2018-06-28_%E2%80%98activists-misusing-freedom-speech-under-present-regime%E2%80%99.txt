‘Activists misusing freedom of speech under present regime’

 
Some civil organisation activists are making baseless allegations misusing the freedom of speech ushered by the present government, Highways and Road Development Minister Kabir Hashim yesterday said.
He said that these allegations are baseless and malicious.
“Today they have freedom to make allegations. But there should be a basis for these allegations. I am sorry to state that those activists as well as the media which spreads this baseless information should check the truth of such information before they publish or broadcast it,” he said.
Minister Hashim made these observations after attending a special programme in Kegalle yesterday morning.
The Minister pointed out that he worked as the Higher Education Minister until March 2015 under the 100-Day Programme and Dr Sarath Amunugama was appointed as the Higher Education Minister on March 22, 2015, by the President.
“Meanwhile, on June 19, the Board of Directors of the University Grants Commission decided to channel investments through the National Savings Bank. At that time the Higher Education Minister was Dr. Sarath Amunugama. Not me. The decision was taken by the University Grants Commission. Therefore, contrary to allegations of activists, I have no connection at all with these matters and clearly I must say that these allegations are baseless,” Minister Hashim said.
Minister Hashim said that the University Grant Commission was blamed by COPE and a system was introduced for UGC investments even in 2013. The UGC did so under the instructions of the Attorney General. Minister Hashim requested that fraud such as that committed by primary dealer, Entrust Company, amounting to over Rs. 12,000 million, be revealed. He was critical of the silence maintained on such issues as these have happened under the previous regime.
“Out of that, Rs. 2,500 million was taken from the Central Bank Pensioners’ Fund and another Rs. 2,500 million from the Ceylon Electricity Board Pensioners Fund,” he said.
