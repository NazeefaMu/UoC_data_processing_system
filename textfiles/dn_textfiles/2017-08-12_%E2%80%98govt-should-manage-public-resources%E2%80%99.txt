‘Govt should manage public resources’

Public resources should be managed under the purview of the government without privatising or entering into agreements with foreign parties, Science and Technology Minister Susil Premajayantha said.
The minister said the Hambantota harbour should have been managed under the government with a capable management without relying on foreign parties.
He said a sound management plan should be implemented to protect public resources.
“If any shortcoming with the management plan arises, a fresh management plan should be implemented.
The country has capable personnel to manage institutions. We are not utilising them for the betterment of the country,” he said.
Privatisation or relying on foreign parties is not an answer to protect state institutions, the minister said.
