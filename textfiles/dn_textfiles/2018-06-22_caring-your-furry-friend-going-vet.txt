Caring for your furry friend Going to the Vet

Taking care of puppy is both a lot of responsibility and a lot of fun. Here is a list of basic puppy care tips for you to make sure your pup stays in good health.
When you get a new puppy you’ll want to setup an appointment with a vet. Depending on where you got your pup and how old they are, you may immediately be due for some shots. If they aren’t currently due you’ll be able to get a health checkup and get on a schedule for yearly shots. Your vet will give your dog some vaccinations to prevent common issues as well as rabies shot.
Ticks and fleas
If you’re bringing your dog outside you’ll want to consider a repellant. If you take your dog in the woods and to the lake and you will occasionally have to pull ticks off him. Make sure to check him after a trip in the woods.
Puppies Eat Anything
Always keep in mind your pup will put just about anything in its mouth. You’ll want to make sure there’s nothing dangerous in reach. These include things like things that will break apart or trash.
Teeth
Taking care of your dog’s teeth is something that often gets neglected, but it’s very important to keep their chompers in tip-top shape. Like humans, they can develop tartar and plaque buildup and gingivitis.
When caring for your dog’s teeth, the earlier you start, the better. The younger your dog is, the more comfortable they’ll become with the process, and of course it starts them on a healthy path early on. Another easy way to take care of your pup’s teeth is by giving them a dental chew.
Grooming
Each breed of dog requires a different amount of grooming. This could be bringing it to get a haircut at the pet store, some occasional brushing, or just giving some baths. When giving your dog a bath you’ll want to get the water to a safe temp and use some pet specific shampoo. You can use treats to make the experience better. Also make sure to get all the soap out or it can get itchy.
Nails
You’ll want to keep your pup’s nails from getting too long. This is something you can do yourself, or you can have it done for you at any place that does grooming, such as a pet store.
Extreme Temperatures
You want to make sure your puppy is safe in extreme temps. In the cold make sure they’re not out too long unless they’re a breed that can handle it. Roads are often salted against ice, so make sure to wipe their paws down after a walk. In the heat you’ll also want to watch how long they’ve been out and how they’re panting. Get them cooled down as needed and make sure they’ve always got water available.
