Pizza Hut introduces new flavours

Pizza Hut introduced three delicious pan pizzas in the month of July, to satisfy each and every pizza fan. The new pizzas include the delicious Peri Peri Chicken, the delectable devilled beef and the tantalizing BBQ chicken.
Yasa Nadaraja, CEO of Gamma Pizzakraft Lanka (Pvt.) Ltd., stated “With every new step that Pizza Hut takes every year, we always ask ourselves what we can do to take our loyal clientele on new journeys of taste, and so, we are proud to be introducing a trio of new toppings to the Pizza Hut menu, including the all new Peri Peri Chicken and Devilled Beef pizzas. As we firmly believe in never standing still, the trio also includes thenew and improved BBQ Chicken pizza, made even better than it was before.”
The Peri Peri Chicken is bound to be a favourite for many, simply overflowing with flavour and it is a brilliant combination of succulent pieces of roast chicken and flavourful peri peri sauce, topped with crunchy onions and a layer of creamy mozzarella cheese. It is sure to be a frequent choice for many. The Devilled Beef is also a first for the menu, featuring the traditional Sri Lankan devilled beef that is made with ginger, garlic, pandan leaves and curry leaves, complemented by fresh capsicums, crunchy onions and a double layer of mozzarella cheese. The BBQ Chicken has always been a favourite for most, and the new upgrade comes as a present of sorts for Pizza Hut’s customers. It is made with BBQ Chicken accompanied by the newest ingredient of the winning formula that is the spicy jalapenos, together with crunchy onions and a double layer of mozzarella cheese, giving customers the ultimate pizza experience.
“Pizza Hut has always been a place for friends and family to celebrate their special moments through their love for pizzas. So we always consider ourselves responsible for finding new tastes for our customers to take delight in. The three pan pizzas coming out truly define the constant efforts we make to produce pizzas of the highest quality and taste”, said Sharmila Arasaratnam, Director Marketing of Gamma Pizzakraft Lanka (Pvt.) Ltd. Peri Peri Chicken and Devilled Beef pan pizzas are now available in the Signature category of the Pizza Hut menu.
