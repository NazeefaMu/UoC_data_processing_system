Villagers demand Galaha Hospital re-opened

A large group of people held a protest at Galaha on Saturday demanding that authorities reopen the Galaha Hospital closed following a tense situation recently after a child's death.
They complained that they are inconvenienced by the closure of the hospital as the next nearest government health facility is at Deltota, 10 km from Galaha.
The Police Special Task Force and riot squads were deployed recently following a tense situation outside the Galaha Hospital following a death of an child admitted to the hospital.
Close to 2,000 people attacked the hospital forcing police to provide security to the hospital and its staff.
The crowd alleged that the one-and-half-year-old child died following a delay in administering treatment at the hospital. The parents had then taken the child to the Peradeniya Hospital in a three wheeler, but the child died before they reached the hospital. The angry mob had damaged hospital property and several vehicles parked at the hospital. Central Province Health Director Dr. Shanthi Samarasinghe transferred doctors at the hospital and health authorities and the police commenced separate investigations.
Seven persons allegedly responsible for damaging public property were arrested later.
