Strike called off

The 48 hour token strike called by the Collective of Railway Operational Supervisory Officers Unions was called off yesterday after discussions held with the Secretary to the Prime Minister.
The Unions which comprised of engine drivers, controllers, guards and station masters launched the strike in protest over salary issues.
A member of the Railway Locomotive Engine Drivers Union speaking to the Daily News said a recent Cabinet Paper had proposed unfair changes to MP1 and MP2 salary scales.
The Unions had two weeks ago directed their grievances to the National Salary and Cadre Commission but had not received a response from them.
The Prime Minister’s Secretary, Saman Ekanayake had in writing promised to resolve the salary anomalies.
