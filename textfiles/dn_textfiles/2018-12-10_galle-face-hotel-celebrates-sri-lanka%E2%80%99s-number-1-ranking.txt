Galle Face Hotel celebrates Sri Lanka’s Number 1 ranking

Sri Lanka, the pearl of the Indian Ocean, has once again made headlines across global media with the release of Lonely Planet’s ‘Best in Travel 2019’ guidebook where the globally acclaimed travel advisor has adjudged Sri Lanka as the number one destination to travel in 2019.
In commemoration of this historical moment, Galle Face Hotel hosted a gala ceremony at Chequerboard with the participation of esteemed guests including Vice President Client Solutions of Lonely Planet Andrew Hinshelwood. The event was graced by many dignitaries including diplomats, representatives of travel and business fraternities, media personnel and travel bloggers.
Citing its reasons for naming Sri Lanka the top travel destination, Lonely Planet reiterates that having better transport links, emergence of new hotels and facilitating diverse leisure and sporting activities crowned Sri Lanka as the coveted number one destination in its annual ‘Best in Travel 2019’ guide book. Lonely Planet is not only one of the largest travel book publishers in the world, but also offers people with comprehensively detailed travel guides covering almost all parts of the globe.
Overlooking the turquoise waters of the Indian Ocean and the lush green expanse of the Galle Face Green, the Galle Face Hotel rises in the heart of Colombo, epitomizing the historical splendour of Sri Lankan hospitality.
