SL envoy’s residence burgled in Islamabad

Islamabad : The residence of the Sri Lankan high commissioner in the capital was burgled, police said on Friday.
The burglars broke into the house located in F-8/2 even though it was guarded by paramilitary troops, and made off with bronze lamps and tabs worth thousands of rupees.
Margalla Police Station House Officer (SHO) Inspector Athar Khan told Dawn that the house was locked since the high commissioner left Pakistan last month. The incident came to light when some officials of the high commission came to the house and found bronze lamps and tabs missing, the SHO stated.
A case was registered on the complaint of high commission official, Sujeeva Amaranath. Meanwhile, burglars stole Rs 30,000, prize bonds worth Rs 75,000 and gold ornaments from a house at G-6/2. Two motorcycles were lifted from a house at G-7/3-4 and a university at G-7/1. (DAWN)
