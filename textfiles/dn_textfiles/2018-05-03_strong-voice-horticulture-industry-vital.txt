Strong voice for horticulture  industry vital

Serendib Horticulture Technologies Chairman and CEO Dilip de Silva says if the government institutes are more amenable to producers and exporters of horticulture products, most of the challenges could be overcome and the opportunities could be made into reality.
Speaking to Daily News Business, Dilip de Silva said that the government agencies should support exporters in their endeavour to reach markets and archaic regulations of import and exports should be looked into on a case by case basis. Commenting on improving the industry in Sri Lanka, Dilip de Silva said there should be only one Ministry dedicated to Horticulture.
“At the moment there are several ministries involved. This model will never work in improving the industry.
We will be stagnant while all the other countries are advancing. I hope the President and the Prime Minister will give serious consideration to this point of view when assigning responsibilities to the new ministries.”
Also commenting on increases in fuel prices, he said, that would certainly have a negative impact on the market.
“Firstly, our production costs will go up and then the costs of our customers who have greenhouses which need heating will also have a higher bill to pay. We need to be very mindful about the cost. If the market is going to stagnate or decline, then expansion of business will have to be put on hold and we would concentrate on existing orders.”
In the meantime, Serendib Horticulture Technologies on its global expansion as consultants in plant biotechnology has been contracted to an Iranian company, Zarkesht in the province of Mazendaran.
Commenting on the latest venture of the company, he said that they have been working for over a year on the consultancy with the objective of transforming an existing laboratory in Iran to a commercial entity at the invitation of its owners.
Dilip de Silva further said, “It’s an honor for the company and the country to be invited to Iran, which is a technologically advanced country, to transfer the company’s technology to Iran.”
The company’s main objective is to introduce commercial technology in plant tissue culture and to introduce management information systems in order to make labs in the host country more productive and competitive.
In April this year, two of its Mangers, Shyamali Widyarathne and Prasanna Thirimanna along with Dilip de Silva were invited for two weeks to train the staff in commercial applications, development of protocols and to develop a management information system.
This was successfully completed. We have now been invited to take up a management contract for a period of two years, said Dilip de Silva.
“When other countries are seeking our advice and technology to improve their horticulture industries, Sri Lanka lacks the commitment to develop horticulture with the locally available technology.”
In addition, the company is currently working on another project in Qatar with a private company, where a new lab will be established with the company’s expertise.
This will also open up job opportunities for Sri Lankan diploma holders and graduates. The company will be interviewing for job opportunities during the next two weeks.
