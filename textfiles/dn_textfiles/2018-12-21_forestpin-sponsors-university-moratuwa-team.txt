Forestpin sponsors  University of Moratuwa team

A Sri Lankan student team has been selected to present their findings at the YES Bank Machine learning competition in Bangalore, India.
YES Bank invited data scientists, companies, researchers and students from all over the world in August to take part in a machine learning competition that involved access to the actual data of YES Bank.
The first round of the competition involved four different machine learning tests over a two month period where data was given and each of the teams were asked to make specific predictions. Based on the results the best teams were selected and given access to actual YES Bank data.
A team of third year undergraduates from electronics department of the University of Moratuwa, Mahendran Sutharasan, Indula Rasanjana, Uththara Chandratilake, Chaturi Jayaweera got selected as one of the teams to receive YES Bank data.
All four of them just completed machine learning internships at Forestpin (Pvt) Ltd. During the last few weeks they have been working closely with the Data Scientists at YES Bank to show how machine learning can be used to improve the banks marketing initiatives.
They have now been selected to the finals to present their findings to the YES Bank executives in Bangalore on December 22.
Forestpin is sponsoring the air tickets of the team to take part in the finals.
