Distributing Petrol to bottles, plastic cans banned

 
Petrol shed owners were notified to refrain from distributing Petrol to individuals with bottles and plastic cans by the Petroleum Resource Development Ministry, today.
The Petroleum Resource Development Ministry said this in a circular, citing the prevailing Petrol shortage crisis.
The demand for petrol rose following a rumour regarding an oil shortage due to the rejection of a fuel shipment imported by the Lanka Indian Oil Company.
CPC sources said on Sunday that the usual consumption of petrol, which is about 2,000 MT per day, had doubled in the last three days as panicked consumers started stocking up on petrol.
