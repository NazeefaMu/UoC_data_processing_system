Let them roam free

Poson Poya is devoted in Sri Lanka for commemorating the advent of Venerable Mahinda Thero to this country, Sri Lanka, to institute the dispensation of Lord Buddha or the Buddhasasana, which took place 2267 years ago (ie. 250 BC) on a Poson full moon day.
After Venerable Thero’s arrival in the country the intellectual conversation that took place between him and King Devanampiya Tissa, the then ruler of the country, on beautiful Mihintale rock is something which everyone in this country must mull over with a sensible mind, of cause, the literal meanings of the conversation was passed down from generation to generation in this country.
In one dialog which the great Thero had with King Devanampiya Tissa, the former uttered to the King, who had run into the thick forest where Mihintale rock was, on a deer hunting expedition, ““Oh! Great King, the birds of the air and the beasts on the earth have an equal right to live and move about in any part of this kingdom as thou. The land belongs to the people and all other living things, and thou art but the guardian of it"
This lofty utterance signifies not only everyone’s right to live but the freedom every being is entitled to. But, to what degree Sri Lankans, at least Buddhists, are fully cognizant of the meaning of this utterance is something to be weighed upon by Sri Lankan Buddhists themselves with a serious and compassionate mind, at least in this Poson season. As Buddhists, can we be happy about the status quo?
Some people in this country who call themselves Buddhists think killing an animal is the act which breaks the first precept, the sin and the wrongdoing, off cause it is a sin and a wrongdoing which breaks the first precept.
But what about caging a bird, keeping a dog in a kennel, chaining an elephant until it gets festering wounds in the leg, forcefully making an elephant to take part in a pageant for many nights continuously, snatching a baby elephant from its helpless mother, depriving a feeble little calf of its mother’s milk, keeping fish in a small tank and so on. Are they alright for a Buddhist ? or acceptable within Buddhist principles. ?. Regrettably, those so called Buddhists have failed to think that such acts are sins, cruelties and unbecoming for Buddhists. Strangely, they don’t know or consider that such acts violate the teachings of Load Buddha the most compassionate one.
To utter dismay, some Buddhist temples are no exceptions. Is it because, those who are dwelling in those temples are less concerned about what Venerable Mahinda Thero uttered on Mihintale rock on the very first day the great Thero set foot on this thrice blessed island to found Buddhasasana or they are less concerned of the very basic values of Buddhism ? or something else? Whatever it is, wrong is wrong which needs to be put right.
Thus, there is no other better time of the year than the Poson season for us, Sri Lankans, to think about this seriously and correct ourselves while celebrating this great Poson season with grandeur and piety.
