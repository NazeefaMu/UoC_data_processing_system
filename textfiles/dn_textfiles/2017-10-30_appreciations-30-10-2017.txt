[APPRECIATIONS - (30-10-2017)]

 
V. Vamadevan
An innovative police administrator
V. Vamadevan was one of those senior police officers who had excellent public relations and always thought of the welfare of his subordinates.
He was one of those exceptional officers in the Police department, never wanting to follow only his predecessor's systems and always thinking out of the box.
Perhaps if he had joined the mercantile sector, he would have certainly reached the position of chairman with ease. Not many are aware that he initiated the change of uniform from shorts to pair of longs for the lower ranks with the blessing of the IGP at the time, Standley Senanayake.
It was his idea to have shoulder flashes with the insignia on the shirts worm by the constables and sergeants, despite comments by some by saying that it resembled beer bottle labels. However, later it became popular as it did give some colour to the uniform.
I never worked with Vamadevan, but it was certainly a strange meeting when he was the Colombo Police Commissioner, when we in the security industry invited him as our chief guest at the Police pavilion to form an association of industrial security, along with the then Lever Bros.
Security Manager Bobby Welikala, Rtd SSP late H. B. Dissanayake and the later Ceylon Cold Stores Chief Security Officer Sydney Soysa, who was then in the Defence Ministry. There were many others including Security Consultants and Investigators General Manager (and Railway Department former Chief Security Officer) E. J. De Silva.
He gave us all encouragement, but unfortunately, enthusiasm was lacking in most of the participants and only later, we formed the Industrial Security Foundation in 1992 with the leadership of Rtd. Senior DIG Edward Gunawardane.
It was unfortunate that Vamadevan and his family had to leave this country under sad circumstances. We lost a gentleman officer who would have contributed much to the Police Department and the country at large.
I did speak to him briefly on the phone in June, this year, whilst I was in Australia, as I had visited my son in Brisbane and the first question he asked me was "Nihal, when are you coming to see me?" I had to disappoint him and told him that since I was in Brisbane, I would certainly see him during my next visit. He did inquire about various Police officers, including M. Edward Gunawardane and Terry Williams.
Perhaps I was not fortunate enough to see him before he closed his eyes! His wife, Charmaine and his children who lived close to his house were a blessing to him.
I recall a verse in a hymn which is typical of him:
Make me your brother, make me your friend Make me a part of your life till its end Accept me in full whatever I be Whatever my race, whatever my creed May he rest in peace.

Terry Willilams
He was an honest officer
I came to know Terry Williams when he was the Kuliyapitiya Police Headquarters Inspector with ASP Iddamalgoda when I was the officer-in-charge of the Narammala Police. He often acted for the ASP when Iddamalgoda was on leave.
Later, he retired prematurely due to personal reasons as a Police superintendent and on an appeal made by him, he was given the rank of retired Senior Superintendent of Police.
After Terry's retirement, he worked in the capacity of Security Manager at Carson Cumberbatch and Co., with his office located at Turret Road and overlooked all their institutions.
He had an excellent rapport with the Chairman, Directors to Manager and other staff.
His unblemished reputation in the Police, his sports connections at St. Peter's College and as Captain of the Police rugger team certainly helped him in his management and leadership skills. He was a capable leader and a rugby legend in the Police. As Security Manager of Carsons, he was assigned to work with me towards the end of 1997, when I was the KLM Royal Dutch Airline Security Manager, when KLM ceased to operate in Colombo. Both of us had a very responsible task in checking the travel documents as the airline was fined for transporting illegal passengers to Amsterdam and the West. In this operation, he was active and he displayed a high degree of honesty and integrity.
Perhaps my task was made easy by his presence and assistance and I would proceed on leave without any hesitation, as there were many travel agents who were trying to bribe both of us to send passengers with forged travel documents.
In our endeavour to prevent unauthorized travel, we angered many in the immigration, travel trade, airport and Sri Lankan Airlines, but Terry stood firm with me and KLM. He was courageous and feared none if challenged, as he was knowledgeable and a man of character, a rare breed.
Having retired from Carsons, he joined my company as a Director Consultant and was of great assistance to me in developing the investigation aspect and coordinating with the Police.
Some family members of his were keen that he retire from work and relax at home watching sports on TV.
I advised him not to retire and work half a day in my office, as he was still healthy and could drive his car.
But he opted to listen to his family members and ultimately fell ill due to inactivity and not having an opportunity to use his knowledge and experience and being unable to keep his mind and body occupied and alert. I visited him as often as I could.
It was sad that his wife Celine died before him, which made him depressed due to loneliness and lack of company with his long-standing spouse departing from this world. All his children were close to him and they loved him, so did his in-laws and the sister-in-law who cared for him till he breathed his last.
Terry, we are sad about your demise. But we know you lived an exemplary life. Perhaps you and Celine are together once again. May you rest in peace

Jeyadevi Chelliah Jesudason
An exemplary teacher
It is saddening to know that death has taken way my dearest, eldest sister, 'Periya akka' Jeyadevi Chelliah Jesudasan from our midst. She lived amidst us fruitfully for 89 years and the latter period of her life after retirement was spent with her daughter in the USA. It has been almost three months since she was called to eternal rest. We are certain she will be safe in the abode of our creator.
My husband and I share with her daughter and family, along with her loved ones, the pain and grief of their personal bereavement and poignancy of the void left in their lives.
As I write this tribute, tears from my eyes trickle down my cheeks and a flood of memories flash back to the days I spent closely with my 'periya akka.' Hailing from a distinguished family in Jaffna, my eldest sister had a great pride in our family heritage. She always loved and cherished her childhood memories and the times we spent with her. Even before she passed away, she phoned us on her last birthday, June 19 and expressed her concern about our health. She was the very epitome of love and sacrifice.
She had her secondary school education at Jaffna Vembadi Girls’ High School until she enrolled herself at Jaffna Central College for her GCE Advanced Level. It was during the days of the English Principal Scowcroft that my sister learnt English from her and developed the love of reading. Besides her academic progress, she excelled in Dramatics and Music, which helped her later in her career as a teacher.
She was a faithful and devoted wife, an affectionate mother, a loving grandmother, an understanding mother-in-law and a dearest sister. She brought up her only daughter in the fear of God, trained her in character and instilled noble values in her. Her hospitality endeared her to her friends and relatives and she stood by them in times of adversity. She was not only a mentor, but also a guide to them. Her life was exemplary and it was a blessing to her near and dear ones.
Though her loving and caring husband, Samuel Jesudason; who was a senior lecturer at Kundasale Training School of Agriculture, predeceased her in 1989; she did not feel her heart withered, because her daughter and son-in-law looked after her with much love and care and they kept her spirits up till the very end.
My sister started her career as an English Teacher in Jaffna with the qualification of London Matriculation and subsequently gained her BA Degree from the University of London, followed by a Postgraduate Diploma-in-Education from the University of Sri Lanka.
She spent her major period of her teaching career at Kandy Girls’ High School, which is a school of name and fame. She served there as a Graduate teacher from 1958 for 30 years and retired from her services in 1988. During her tenure, she held the positions of Grade 2 Special Post and Grade 1 Principal Post (SLPS-1).
Being an experienced graduate teacher with her Postgraduate Diploma-in-Education, she served with a stamp of efficiency, commitment and integrity and she was greatly admired by her students and superiors. She taught especially Tamil in the GCE Advanced Level classes and her strategy of teaching, interspersed with humour and familiar examples, made the students to comprehend the subject concepts easily and achieve excellent results.
She not only taught lessons to students, but also instilled in them the values of discipline such as obedience, punctuality and responsibility. Though she was stern, she built up a good rapport with the students. This facilitated her to maintain discipline. Her students still remember her as the sectional head of the Tamil section, attired in a sophisticated style, well-suited to her fair complexion, gracefully and elegantly walking down the school corridors to maintain discipline. Many of her students are holding professional qualifications and even serving in different parts of the globe.
She gave her full co-operation in all the extra-curricular activities of the school. She composed a song in Tamil in regard to the Education Ministry centenary celebrations and also served in the Education Ministry Centenary Executive Committee. She trained students, staged dramas and played a key role in organizing Tamil Day/Cultural celebrations. She was a good singer, song writer and had translated the school anthem into Tamil. She used to represent the principal at the principals’ meeting for the Tamil section.
Though she is a practising Christian, the most admirable quality in her is that she had reverence for other religions and never showed any racial or religious bias. She even trained the students for bhakthi gee programmes and thus, set an example of inter-religious harmony. She is the very embodiment of simplicity, gentility, geniality, generosity and humaneness.
The then principal of Kandy Girls’ High School, T. K. Ekanayake, in her school annual report, made a special mention of my dearest sister, Jeyadevi Chelliah Jesudason, as a person who had all the noble values of a successful teacher and that the void created by her retirement cannot be easily filled.
My sister had a lively mind even in her old age and she spent her leisure in a fruitful way. The pictures patterned in cross-stich by her reminds her aesthetic skill in decorative sewing as we see them on the walls of the sitting rooms of her relatives and friends.
My husband and I extend our deepest sympathies to her daughter Kausi, her son-in-law, Wijeyan (Both are University Dons) and to her grandson, Cholan who is pursuing his medical studies. May the Almighty God, the greatest comforter, give strength to them to bear this profound grief.
Let me conclude my tribute with the following lines:
Dearest 'Periya akka,' You are gone, but not gone forever. Your sweet memories, we always treasure; That too, to an immense measure. Your near and dear ones, you will miss, Until we meet again in heavenly bliss

Remembering Nirmala Devi Ramachandran
The first lady Inland Revenue Commissioner is no more,
Because this sprightly 81-year-old has been summoned before, The universe's creator, To be assigned a place in the abode of the Maker. The news of her demise, Came as a surprise, After a private funeral-cremation, To many a friend and relation. In the salubrious environs of Ward Place, she was born and bred, And lived there, performing on the world’s stage, till she was pronounced dead. Born in 1935, on the 23rd of November Died in 2017, on the 21st of September. The only girl in a family of four, Her father: the late Dr. Vairamutthu Kathirgamatamby predeceased her by 70 years or more, Though deprived of a father's love and care at a tender age The values of honesty, justice and fair-play, she was imbued with from her mother (Chellam) and alma mater, enabled her to face any challenging task on the world’s stage. At Ladies College, she had her primary and secondary education, And read for a Physical Science degree of the London University, from Aquinas College, a Private Institution, And secured a Hons. class degree, That paved the way to join the Prestigious Inland Revenue fraternity. In 1960, Dr. Surendra married Nirmala Devi. In 1962, they brought forth Sudarshan, their progeny, Who has soared over his father’s medical renown, By bagging two professorial medical gowns. Dr. Surendra and Nimo acted as the wind under the other’s wings, To soar to great heights despite envious stings. The husband was bestowed the much-coveted Deshamanya National Award, The wife as the First Lady Commissioner General in the field of Inland Revenue a recond. During her watch as Commissioner General, The Revenue Collection reached a very high level. The Collection for the period 94 -95 being 20 percent of G.D.P. The highest in the last one and a half decades of the 20th century. Nimo was a voracious reader, And also a great traveller, Hence, she put pen and photography to paper, To publish 3 volumes of Hindu heritage to enrich Hindu culture. To the Ramakrishna Mission Trust Fund treasury She assigned the book’s royalty, To be used for charity, To alleviate poverty. Friends and relations please note, Nimo’s favourite quote, Culled from the verse ‘Farewell my Friend’ by Rabindranath Tagore A plea by those who we will, on planet earth, see no more 'Farewell, farewell My friends I smile and bid you Goodbye. No, shed no tears For I need them not All I need is your smile' It is difficult to say goodbye with a smile dear friend Because your life on earth has come to an end. But Sudarshan, Sanju, Shanath, Pravinath, Harishnath and those near and dear to you will you miss, While you enjoy eternal bliss.
A. Pulle,
Former Inland Revenue Commissioner
