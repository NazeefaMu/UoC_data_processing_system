Special religious ceremony to commemorate tsunami anniversary

A special religious ceremony will be held at the tsunami memorial at Pereliya, Galle today to commemorate the 13th anniversary of the devastating tsunami on the boxing day of 2004 which killed over 35,000 people.
Two minutes silence will be observed from 9.25 a.m. to 9.27 a.m. today to commemorate the tsunami victims.
The 2004 tsunami-rail disaster in Peraliya is the largest single rail disaster in world history where over 1,500 people travelling in the Matara bound train from Colombo died.
Similar commemoration services are organised by the Disaster Management Division district branches island-wide.
Sri Lanka was hit by the tsunami triggered by a 9.0 magnitude earthquake off the coast of Sumatra on December 26, 2004. The tsunami tragedy was one of the worst disasters ever recorded in Sri Lankan history. It left thousands dead, many more homeless and misery around the country.
