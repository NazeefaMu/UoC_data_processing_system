Provincial Councillor performs devil dance

Southern Provincial Councillor Krishantha Pushpakumara conducted an unusual demonstration against the United People’s Freedom Alliance Councillors loyal to the Yahapalana government before the commencement of the council meeting yesterday.
The councillor who arrived much earlier to the meeting steered a Salu Paliya (a traditional dance) from the Kalegana Junction to the Council Secretariat bearing a couple of flambeaux and reciting demonic stanzas. He performed a devil dance in the council later on pleading demons to chase away robber demons from the council chamber. Puspakumara recited a number of stanzas denoting that the UPFA councillors are a gang of robbers.
