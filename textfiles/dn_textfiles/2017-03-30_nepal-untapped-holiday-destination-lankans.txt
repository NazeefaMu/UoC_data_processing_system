Nepal, an untapped holiday destination for Lankans

Both Sri Lanka and Nepal are yet to exploit the tourism potential and this is an area that needs urgent attention.
The Nepal Embassy hosted a highly interesting event titled ‘Tourism in Nepal’ at the Kingsbury Hotel recently and it was said that this is despite the two countries having direct air links between the two countries and also having a simplified visa procedure.
A select group of those connected with tourism and key government officials, representatives of the private sector and Chambers of Commerce was present on the occasion. The event was timely and appropriate since Nepal is making an endeavor to arouse interest in tourism, a key source of her revenue generation which coincides with that country's efforts to stabilize itself with after relative inactivity politically, and economically.
Sri Lanka on the other hand is on the crest of a wave in tourism and the recent developments are reflective of the big strides made in this field.
The staff of the Nepal Embassy headed by Charge de Affairs M. Joshi needs to be complimented for undertaking this task. There were two main components of this valued exercise.
Sri Lankans could obtain visas free from the Nepal Embassy in Kynsey Road, Colombo and its free visa for Nepalese from Colombo. One was the visual presentation accompanied by a narrative which explained the geography of Nepal, her culture, ‘and hot spots’ for tourists. This presentation was orchestrated by the Charge de Affairs herself.
The second component was the screening of a film on Nepal which too was of absorbing interest.
Before the presentation was the address delivered by the chief guest, Secretary of the Ministry of Tourism and Christian Religious Affairs, Janaka Sugathadasa outlined the macro perspectives of tourism.
Sugathadasa opined that tourism is a driving force for development and a medium for promoting people to people contact. These were necessary for creating goodwill and are an effective measure to develop cosmopolitanism.
According to Sugathadasa while Nepal had been affected by natural disasters, Sri Lanka too had been affected by disasters which were man made.
Commenting on the recently inaugurated direct flights between Kathmandu and Colombo by Himalayan Airlines, Sugathadasa said that it was a boost to tourism. Concluding his address he said that Sri Lanka should add value to the tourism product, re-define and adopt a more holistic approach to the development of tourism.
The film presentation also showed Nepal's vast hilly regions, valleys and rivers and people of different ethnic origins that live in Nepal.
The film also depicted Nepal's unique architecture, her handicrafts besides the most favored tourist locations.
Also shown were water sports and other features of interest to tourists in this land of arresting beauty.
