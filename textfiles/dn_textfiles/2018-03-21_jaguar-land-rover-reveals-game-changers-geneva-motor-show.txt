Jaguar Land Rover reveals game-changers at Geneva Motor Show

Jaguar Land Rover has revealed two ground-breaking models to the world at the 88th Geneva International Motor Show, which concluded last Sunday.
Fresh off its global reveal, the Jaguar I-PACE that made its way to Switzerland from Austria for its public debut, with the battery electric, all-wheel-drive, premium SUV leading Jaguar’s presence at the show.
Land Rover also had something to shout about by reinventing the SUV segment with a luxurious, limited edition, two-door Range Rover. Unveiled to the public for the first time at the Geneva Motor Show, the Range Rover SV Coupe becomes the world’s first full-sized SUV, which sets new standards for materials and craftsmanship.
With only 999 vehicles being made, each will be crafted to a customer’s specification by Jaguar Land Rover Special Vehicle Operations division.
Making its presence at the show is Iron Maiden drummer Nicko McBrain’s custom-made Jaguar XJ6 III, which has been lovingly restored by Jaguar Classic as a ‘Greatest Hits’ version of the musician’s car.
