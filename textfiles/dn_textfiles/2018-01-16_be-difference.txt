Be the difference!

The band Wildfire is loved by its fans and respected by its competitors. It has been successful due to the fact that its band members have got the right idea about music and they have the proper temperament. The first thing that Derek Wikramanayake of Wildfire did when he was part of the original line up of Purple Rain was to listen to other bands and discover what he was up against.
Music was made in heaven and created for the angels to sing. And then it was gifted to the world we live in and its power is awesome. Yet Melodies discovered that being able to sing is not everything. Yes you have the voice and the talent, but there is much more to it. Because as Wikramanayake points out singing is one tenth of the musical experience.

“My message to any young guy or girl who wants to enter the music industry is not to be in a hurry to get to the top. Some young people want to become a super star overnight. Just because you can sing well does not make you a superstar. To become a star you need more than that. You need to be able to communicate with people. You need that charisma. You need to be able to present yourself,” said Wikramanayake.
We all know that there have been many child stars not only in the music industry but even in fields such as acting and sports who have gone wrong since it became too much for them – the fame and the added pressure and temptations that come with that fame.
“You need to know how the band should harmonize. Some bands cannot do it and they are so bad. In my band, the members freely express their opinion and we are open to each ones ideas. We are very humble with each other. We are a group and unity is very important. My advice to any youngster is to know what you are up against. I always believe in being different and not like any other band. Wildfire has to be different. Don’t be afraid to get advice from older musicians because you can learn from them and experience is something you cannot buy. You have to grow through experience,” said Wikramanayake.
Wikramanayake has been passionate about music since he was a kid. He says that when he listens to good music his mind is at ease and free, and that he is not angry, depressed or sad when he is listening to good music. Good music does not give you a headache.
“We have done a lot of concerts and foreign tours, and last year we did Australia, Dubai, Maldives and this year we have some tours coming up as well. We are an entertaining band and we love playing requests. My favorite band is Steely Dan. I also like David Bowie, the Beatles, Rolling Stone, Christopher Cross and Chitral Somapala,” stated Wikramanayake.
Interestingly the name Wildfire came from a horse. There was a story about a horse called Wildfire and Wikramanayake suggested this name for the band which would one day be called Purple Rain. But Geoffrey Fernando said he wanted the name Purple Rain. Purple Rain was a good name and the band was very successful. Then when Wikramanayake formed Wildfire with Chris Dhason he called it Wildfire.
“The beginning of Wildfire was in February 2000. This was at the JAIC Hilton. The person who was handling affairs for JAIC Hilton knew me and Chris Dhason. We were given a spot on Sunday. When we played on that Sunday, there were only five people at the bar. After the first break when we came back there were 15 people. When we came after the second break there were around 25 people. And then on the third Sunday from making Rs. 25,000 a night, JAIC was recording over Rs. 200,000 on a Sunday. By the third Sunday it was packed and you could not even move!,” explained Wikramanayake.
The group started off with Retro Music. They did not want to play disco stuff, and instead played oldies such as the Beatles and 1960’s and 1970’s music.
“Our music changed from Retro, to more pop music with a lot of dance and hip hop music. We started playing rock music and then alternate rock. People just kept requesting songs from us. The young ones would request alternate rock from us and we just obliged. We then built up an alternate rock repertoire. At one time fathers would bring their songs to listen to us. We found that absolutely amazing. There are different facets to Wildfire. The repertoire that Wildfire has, no other band in this country has. We have an amazing variety of music which has a lot to do with our experience,” pointed out Wikramanayake.
When Wildfire started in 2000, there were hardly any live bands in Sri Lanka. They were like a breath of fresh air in Sri Lanka, because theirs was handmade music in Sri Lanka which was raw. People liked it because there was a vacuum. There was a need for that kind of music in Sri Lanka.
“When Chris Dhason brought an Acoustic Drum kit to Sri Lanka, people were asking him where he was going to use it. Chris said he would use it everywhere! It was the sincerity and the rawness of the music of Wildfire that appealed to people. It is fun for me to play in the band. Making people happy through my music motivates me, and I get excited about that. That is common to all our members, and we all feel this way about our job. We look forward to going to work. For me it is the best job in the world playing with these guys. We have no stress,” added Wikramanayake.
Wikramanayake also stressed the importance of learning to play an instrument well. You should know other instruments in addition to the instrument of your choice. Half way is no good. You need to learn your instrument as best as you can.
