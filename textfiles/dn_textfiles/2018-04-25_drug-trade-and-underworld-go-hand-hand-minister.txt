Drug trade and underworld go hand in hand - Minister

Drugs is a major issue that plagues the country with around 63 percent of drugs coming into the country through various harbours and 25 percent being smuggled through the southern and western sea areas, Law and Order Minister Ranjith Madduma Bandara said.
“The drug trade and underworld go hand in hand and one cannot be resolved without the other being addressed,” the Minister said.
Minister Badduma Bandara speaking at a press conference yesterdaym, urged journalists not to idolise criminals through the media. “Sometimes the media highlights these criminals and portray them as heroes or victims, while making the Police look like villains. I therefore urge the media to report these cases in a responsible manner by helping the Police control and enforce law and order in the country,” he said.
He noted that some police officers are facing threats to their lives having been involved in such high profile cases.
However,IGP Pujith Jayasundara said he has taken all measures to ensure the safety of such Police officers and their families.
He said that it is the duty of the Police Department to guarantee the safety of their officers, so that they can perform their duties without the fear of being targets of these criminals.
