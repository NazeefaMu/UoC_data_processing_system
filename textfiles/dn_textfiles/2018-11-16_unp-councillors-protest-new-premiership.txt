UNP councillors protest new Premiership

United National Party (UNP) councillors of the Agalawatte Urban Council were attired in black at a recent council meeting, in protest of President Maithripala Sirisena’s decision to appoint MP Mahinda Rajapaksa as the new Prime Minister. They alleged that the President had violated the Constitution.
UNP member Chandika Tantrige protested against the alleged assault directed at him by supporters of former Deputy Minister Palitha Thewarapperuma.
