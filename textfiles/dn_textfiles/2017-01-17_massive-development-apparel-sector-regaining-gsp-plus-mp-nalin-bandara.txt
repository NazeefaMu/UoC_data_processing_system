Massive development in apparel sector with regaining of GSP Plus: MP Nalin Bandara

A massive development in the apparel sector is expected with the regaining of the GSP Plus concession to Sri Lanka, Kurunegala MP Nalin Bandara said.
He said Sri Lanka would receive the GSP Plus concession in the next 4 months.
He was addressing a media briefing yesterday at Siri Kota.
“Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe participated in the World Economic Forum in Switzerland. Reputed businessmen all over the world will be participated in this forum. Therefore, we will be able to attract many investors to Sri Lanka which the previous regime failed to do,” he said.
Puttalam UNP MP Hector Appuhamy said 2017 is dedicated for sustainable development and many projects to establish Tourism zones and Industrial zones will be implemented.
He said ‘Yahapalanaya’ regime would mainly focus on developing the country rather than spending more resources on prosecuting offenders.
“Regional resources will be used to develop the country with the aid of human resources,” Appuhamy said.
