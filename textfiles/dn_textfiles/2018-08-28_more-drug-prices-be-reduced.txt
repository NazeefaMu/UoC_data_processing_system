More drug prices to be reduced

The prices of another 26 drugs will be reduced in the near future, Health Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne said.
Minister Senaratne said the gazette notification on regulating private hospital charges will be issued next week. The high prices of 48 drugs have been reduced although there were protests by various drug companies, he said.
“Health should not be a commercial business only. It should be a service too,” he added.
The minister was addressing the 40th anniversary of Sanasa in Colombo, recently.
Minister Senaratne said the people should be given independence in various forms.
They should be given the economic freedom and be saved from poverty. Information technology has developed significantly and communication should be used freely, he added.
The co-operative system was created in Sri Lanka in 1906 and Sanasa was established in 1978.
“It has become a grown tree today and serves the underprivileged in Sri Lanka. According to the founder of Sanasa Dr. P. A. Kiriwandeniya, today Sanasa owns only 30 percent because the rich had invested in it,” the minister said.
