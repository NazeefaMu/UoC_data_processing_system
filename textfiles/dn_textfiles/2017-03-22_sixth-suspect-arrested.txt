Sixth suspect arrested

The CID arrested a corporal, and the sixth suspect attached to the Army Intelligence Unit, yesterday, in connection with the assault on journalist Keith Noyahr in 2008.
He was arrested for colluding with the team which abducted the journalist. The suspect was remanded until March 30 by the Mt. Lavinia Magistrate’s Court yesterday. The corporal is attached to the Tripoli Army Camp in Maradana.
The CID which re-opened the case of the abduction and assault on Noyahr, in 2015, have already arrested five army intelligence personnel in connection with the case; the arrests were made early this year. Field Marshal Sarath Fonseka in his evidence to the CID had earlier stated that a special unit which operated under former Head of Intelligence Services Kapila Hendawitharana carried out several attacks in Colombo. It has also become increasingly clear that the same group which carried out the attack on former Sunday Leader Editor Lasantha Wickrematunga was connected to the attack on Noyahr.
“This crime too has been committed using the army,” confirmed CID Inspector Nishantha Silva.
Inspector Silva also explained that technical evidence obtained from the mobile phones of the suspect showed that all of them were in contact with each other when the attack took place . The data from the phones also linked them to the house in Dompe which they had taken Noyahr to.
“The group had rented out the house using money from the Army Intelligence Unit,” added Silva.
Investigations since 2015 revealed that the Army Intelligence Unit had rented two houses in Dompe; one in Lansiyawatte and the other in Baduwatte Walawwa. They had used Dompe Lansiyawatte from the end of 2007 to the beginning of 2008. After vacating it , it had obtained Dompe Baduwatte Walawwa in March 2008 on lease. They had occupied this house from that date to March 2009 for a one-year period. It is believed that this house had been used by a sub-unit of the intelligence unit of the Tripoli Camp of Maradana.
On May 22, 2008, Keith Noyahr was abducted and tortured by unidentified persons over his critical analyses of Sri Lanka’s security situation during the war in his column which he wrote under a pseudonym.
