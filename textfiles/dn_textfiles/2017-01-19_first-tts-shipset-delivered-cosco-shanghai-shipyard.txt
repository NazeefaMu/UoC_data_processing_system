First TTS Shipset delivered to COSCO Shanghai Shipyard

TTS Group announced the delivery of the first of four shipset of TTS deck equipment to COSCO Shanghai Shipyard.
In April 2015, Shanghai Shipyard Co. Ltd., part of the China State Shipbuilding Corporation (CSSC), ordered various TTS deck equipment for four 28.000 DWT Multipurpose Heavy Lift Vessels. The first official hand over took place this week end.
The vessels are part of the ongoing fleet extension program of China Ocean Shipping (Group) Company (COSCO). COSCO already operates eight identically constructed vessels (Da Type 3) with a maximum lifting capacity of 700t in tandem operation - the largest cranes in the fleet, all made by TTS NMF.
Each ship is equipped with two heavy lift cranes of proven TTS NMF type DK II with SWL 350t and one TTS NMF type DK II SWL 100t lifting capacity.
The crane contract was executed through the new Joint Venture TTS SCM Marine and Offshore Machinery Co., Ltd. (TTS SCM), established by TTS NMF GmbH and South China Marine Machinery (SCM) in 2015. SCM is part of the China State Shipbuilding Corporation (CSSC).
In addition the new vessels are equipped with heavy lift hatch covers of trans-folding and pontoon type from TTS HUA Hai Ships Equipment Co., Ltd.
Finally, the TTS deck equipment is completed by two combined windlass / automatic mooring winches and two automatic mooring winches. Both electrically driven winch systems are outfitted with a self-aligned foundation and prepared for remote operation.
