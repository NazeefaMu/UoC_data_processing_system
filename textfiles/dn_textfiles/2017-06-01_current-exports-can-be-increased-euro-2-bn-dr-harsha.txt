Accordingly a Forum to disseminate information on the benefits of regaining the GSP+ facility was conducted by the Chamber on the 22nd of May 2017 in Colombo, following the confirmation of the regaining of the GSP+ concessions by Sri Lanka.Over 200 member exporters of the Chamber, non-members, as well as service providers to exporters participated at the Forum.

They were assisted by Ramal Jasinghe, the President of the NCE and by Shiham Marikar, Secretary General of the Chamber.
Deputy Minister Dr. Harsha De Silva, outlined the success of the Government in regaining the GSP+ facility due to its own efforts related to the improvement of human rights and labor rights etc. and the right to obtain information made as an election promise, and not due to pressure from the EU or any other external agency as perceived by some.
He also stated that the current exports of 2.3 bn Euro can be increased by a further 2 bn Euro by the end of this year with proper effort. His address also highlighted the importance of Sri Lankan Diplomatic Missions focusing on ‘Commercial Diplomacy’and stressed that Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) have been given to related staff in missions to perform, and also that training on market intelligence has been provided to Heads of Missions and Commercial Counsellors to derive optimum benefits from the concessions.
Paul Godfrey in his overview related to the concessions, mentioned that assuming Sri Lanka will reach upper middle income country status by the end of this year, Sri Lanka will have till the end of 2021 (including the grace period of one year) to benefit from the GSP+ facility, and that around 6,000 product lines will benefit under GSP+ with zero import duty.
