Kids IN KITCHEN

 Baking Cookies 
Here are the perfect tips for making your baking time together delightful.
 
Start early 
Schedule baking early in the day when everyone is fresh and well-rested. This is particularly important if you will be working with younger children.
 
Cover up 
Place a plastic drop cloth beneath the table where the baking and decorating will take place. Dress your children in comfortable, washable clothes and roll up their sleeves. Also pull back long hair.
Try a team approach 
Divide the children into two groups. Put one group to work mixing the ingredients for the dough and then rolling and cutting the dough with cookie cutters. Let the second group begin decorating the already baked cookies.
 
Get ready to decorate 
Organize small candies and cookie decorations in muffin pans. Put frosting in small unbreakable bowls and provide small plastic knives for safe spreading. Also set out a variety of ready-to-use decorator icings and gels in tubes.
 
Provide inspiration 
Decorate several cookies in advance and place them in the center of the table to jump start your children’s creativity.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Value of Cooking 
Cooking can be a great way to reinforce subjects being taught at school or introduce new ones. Here are just a few of the skills cooking can help teach your children:
 
Simple math skills 
Many recipes can be doubled or halved, which will require math skills such as dividing and multiplying.
 
Nutrition 
Use your time together in the kitchen to teach your children the importance of good nutrition. Encourage them to try new fruits, vegetables, and other healthy foods.
 
Following directions 
Recipes need to be put together in a specific order. This can help show your children the importance of following directions, whether they are baking a cake or doing a science experiment.
 
Measuring 
Using measuring cups to get the appropriate amounts of ingredients teaches about the importance of careful and accurate measuring.
 
Sensory awareness Cooking and baking can expose your child to new textures, tastes, colours, odours, and more.
Language skills 
Reading food labels and recipes can help your children improve their reading skills and learn the meanings of unfamiliar words.
 
Art 
From making a face out of vegetables on a pizza to decorating cookies with sprinkles and icing, cooking provides endless opportunities for artistic expression!
 
Cultural awareness 
Introducing your children to ethnic dishes may encourage them to learn more about the culture and people that inspired the dish.
Safety in the kitchen is essential at this stage. Be sure that your children do not go near the stove or electric mixers while they are turned on. Keep all sharp knives and other instruments well out of reach.
