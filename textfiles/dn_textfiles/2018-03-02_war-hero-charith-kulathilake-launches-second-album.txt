War hero Charith Kulathilake launches second album

The second music album, Sihinayakse, of the visually impaired war hero Corporal Charith Kularuwan Kulathilake of the 5 Vijayabahu Infantry Regiment (VIR), was presented to Army Commander Lieutenant General Mahesh Senanayake recently at the Defence Services College.
Corporal Kulathilake made a name for himself in the ‘Ranaviru Real Star’ musical talent programme.
For the second time, the assistance lent to him by Lieutenant General Senanayake, and VIR Regiment Colonel Major General Ajith Kariyakarawana, prompted him to produce the album with 16 new songs while spending time at Abimansala-1 in Anuradhapura.
The launch of the Sihinayakse was graced by the Army Commander as Chief Guest, together with his wife, Chandrika, who is President of the Army Seva Vanitha Unit and a host of invitees.
The welcome address was delivered by well-known author Sumithra Godage.
Copies of the album were presented to Wimala Amaradewa, spouse of the late maestro Pandith Amaradewa and Lieutenant General Senanayake, followed by its presentation to other distinguished invitees.
Due to the blessings of late Pandith Amaradewa and Wimala Amaradewa as well as the encouragement and unfailing support he received, Kulathilake made his debut earlier with his first album, Rana Handa Esunawe.
Kulathilake who lost his sight and is physically handicapped as a result of a terrorist explosion at the Muhamalai frontline, succeeded in entering the final round of the ‘Ranaviru Real Star - Mission 3,’ a few years back.
Security Forces – West Commander Major General Sathyapriya Liyanage, senior officers, officers, other ranks, renowned vocalists, lyrics writers, artistes, the spouse of the vocalist, relatives, Abimansala and Mihindu Sethmedura inmates and a large gathering extended their greetings on the occasion.
