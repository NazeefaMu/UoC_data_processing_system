Four Star Rating for SriLankan for second year running

SriLankan Airlines was honoured with a prestigious Four Star Rating in the Major Regional Airline category by the Airline Passenger Experience Association (APEX) for the second year running. APEX (www.apex.aero) is the world’s only non-profit membership trade association dedicated to improving the entire airline passenger experience. The ratings are based on the feedback of passengers from around the world, who rated airlines on overall flight experience; seat comfort; cabin service; food and beverage; entertainment; and Wi-Fi.
The overall passenger ratings were then certified by an external auditing service hired by APEX prior to establishing each airline’s official rating. In addition to a Four Star Rating, APEX nominated SriLankan’s video advertisement “Epic Journey of Sri Lanka on SriLankan in the “Best Original Video” category over major airlines such as Qatar; Emirates; Singapore Airlines; Air New Zealand; and Cathay Pacific.
SriLankan recently won a host of accolades including ‘Asia’s Leading Airline To The Indian Ocean – 2018’ and ‘Asia’s Leading Marketing Campaign-2018’ at the World Travel Awards for Asia and Australasia.
The airline has been rapidly modernizing its fleet with the addition of brand new wide body A330-300 and narrow body A320neo and A321neo aircraft.
Passengers now enjoy a service with comfortable seats, state of the art entertainment systems, excellent in-flight cuisine, on board connectivity and flight attendants famed for their warmth and caring.
SriLankan’s global network covers 104 cities in 47 countries and as a member of the oneworld global airline alliance it also connects its passengers to oneworld’s worldwide network of more than 1,000 destinations in 160 countries.
