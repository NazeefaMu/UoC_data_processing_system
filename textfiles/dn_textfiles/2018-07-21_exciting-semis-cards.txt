UTE Engineering Pin & Pam Fernando Trophy 2018
Exciting semis on the cards

The Match-play excitement gripped the RCGC with a few unexpected results coming through. Zaffar Sikkander who ousted the Top Seed was over hauled by the experienced and consistent Manjula Chandrasoma 2 & 1. Youngest Qualifier looked a leading contender for the Pin Fernando Trophy comfortably beating Rohan J Perera 7 & 6, to set-up a top half semi-final clash
with Manjula Chandrasoma.
In the bottom half of the draw Gihan Siribaddana beat Rohan De Silva in an evenly matched pairing, quite easily 3 & 2. Riahn Peiris another youngster with a solid sporting pedigree brushed aside the 2017 Runner-up Tyronne Weerackody 3 & 2.
It appears that the ‘cousins’ Armand and Riahn may meet in the final to fight –out for supremacy and win the coveted Pin Fernando Trophy 2018.
In the Pam Fernando Trophy 2018, top seeded Niloo was beaten by Anusha Senadira, setting up a semi-final clash with Dr. Praveena Dunuwila, who comfortably beat Anouk Chitty.
In the second half of the Ladies draw Usha De Silva beat Louise Parsons, whilst Kumari Herath won over Eliane Sterchi. The Pam Fernando Trophy, also has a chance of ‘sisters’ meeting in the final but Dr. Praveena Dunuwila, back in the game after a while appears to have the prescription for victory!Nonetheless, awesome golf can be expected in both Semi- final clashes for both trophies.
