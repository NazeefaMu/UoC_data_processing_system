Citizens' Mail

WORK OUT FOR THY SALVATION WITH DILIGENCE
It seems discernible to the rational minded Buddhists in particular and the non-Buddhists in general that it is high time to turn to hermitage Buddhists order to safeguard Theravada Buddhism in Sri Lanka from Buddhists masquerades. Knowingly or unknowingly to the chief prelates, a substantial portion of the Sangha order is involved in nefarious activities bringing utter disgrace to them. The other day, a scoundrel wearing saffron robes that we venerate was caught red handed form is leading some innocent people to earn a quick buck promising them to find employment in Japan.
Some monks are engaged in black arts on a large scale putting huge advertisements in the national press. They appear before the courts for committing the offences of child abuse and sexual harassment. If a thorough survey is conducted, many a glaring instance of gross violation of public decency could be found. At present, more and more monks are reaching very closer to mundane life and their dress code makes the difference. This blatant truth is put under the carpet by people to save the skin from the monks because the political power of the ruling party is always in their hands. The die is cast.
I very recently visited a monastery in Tissamaharama to offer alms in the morning. We spent the previous night there and I had a whale of a chance to observe their way of life. Even though my good parents had accompanied me to such places in my childhood, this is the first time I had the firsthand experience of seeing their exemplary composure with my naked eyes.
Once I had a student at my GELT classes by the name Rex Tharanjan. He entered the Faculty of Science of the University of Ruhuna and later I came to know that at the completion of his degree programme he had ordained in a forest monastery. The Buddha preached us after rationally understood the world to work out for thy salvation with diligence. The aforementioned science graduate ascetic epitomizes true monkhood in my view. I heard from her sister that he discourages visiting him even by his family members.
It is quite palpable to me that our monks are thoroughly disgusted and sick of the status quo of the country now. They have to devote much of their time to advise the government and the general public on each and every matter of mundane existence ranging from cricket even to geology and road engineering. I heard some enthusiastic inventors get advice and blessing from monks even for rocket science. This situation is truly troublesome for them. Some monks are forced to read their horoscopes by laymen. So, they do not have time to work on the temple tea lands for temple expenses. The time for Buddhists activities and spiritual liberation of the laymen and their own have to be lengthened for the betterment of Buddhism in Sri Lanka.
Our dunderheads do not allow our monks to contribute constructively for the uplift of religion. Since independence, our saffron robed venerable monks left no stone unturned to come out of this treacherous bog of spiritual decay. Yet, the monks at hermitages have been rendering a yeoman service for the emancipation of the true Buddhists. They are doing it under trying conditions.
A larger slice of the annual allocations for Buddhists activities could be channeled towards hermitage development and encourage our monks to find refuge in them without involving in breakneck undertakings of the blathering politicians. Their usual way of tilting windmills and dragging the sacred Maha Sangha to mundane matters could be avoided.
