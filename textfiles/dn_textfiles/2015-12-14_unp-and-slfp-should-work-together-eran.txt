UNP and SLFP should work together - Eran

The UNP and SLFP should work together realistically and it is fundamental to the success of Sri Lanka, State Enterprise Development Deputy Minister Eran Wickremaratne making said.
The minister said so delivering the keynote address at the “Mayors’ Forum on Future Cities” organised by the Colombo Municipal Council (CMC) to commemorate the 150th Anniversary.
“In order to develop policies, there has to be a dialogue and understanding within the political establishment, between politicians and the people and amongst the people as well. We can only drive forward the government through discussion. Dialogue and unity are important not just between ethnic communities, different religions, politicians and the people, but also between the UNP and SLFP. ‘Dialogue and unity’ is something we must not just preach but practice. President Maithripala Sirisena and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe are showing the way through example. They have a common vision, they have common values, and they are putting forward a common action programme. It is important to lead by example than just to talk about visions and plans. That is what the new leadership is doing,” he said.
The Deputy Minister also stressed that the public transportation in Sri Lanka is entirely outdated and needs to undergo genuine modernization.
“The previous government poured in millions to build in ports and airports, yet failed to make lives better for the ordinary man who takes an over crowded bus or a train every day to work. By installing the GPS system on buses the public can track the routes, arrival times, and estimated time to destinations.
This would save people the anxieties over bus delays and considerable amount of time wasted. There is much to be done in the area of public transport. The Fort Railway station has not changed since independence. The Government has already identified heavy road congestion as one of the major issues facing Colombo. I don’t think that these kinds of issues should be just left to the central Government, but the city should take its own initiative” he said.
He also noted the development initiatives carried out in the cities must be people-centric.
“According to the Global Innovation Index Sri Lanka is ranked poorly at 85 out of 141 countries. Contrastingly, Singapore is ranked 7th, Hong Kong is ranked 11th.
This highlights the lack of an environment conducive to entrepreneurship and innovation in Sri Lanka and under investment in our human capital. I have a blueprint to develop Moratuwa as an industrial park, knowledge park, and to set up a world class carpentry school. The hospital will be linked digitally to the other hospitals n the country. A public safety network will be set up” he noted.
Central Bank Governor Arjuna Mahendran pointed out the legislation pertaining to the land ownership and the ownership of condominiums etc. must be revised soon as those are “muddied and unclear”.
“The present government set out the creation of a mega polis as a key investment and economic policy platform to take its agenda forward. The idea is that we make Colombo and its environs the most livable city in South Asia. In reaching this target, one critical area that has to be addressed is the issue of land ownership. I believe the new government has plans to address this issue because for any mega city to thrive, there has to be a very clear legal framework in terms of the ownership of property and property rights” he observed.
“We are lucky we are having the investors like the Shangri-la group which opening up a big complex right opposite the port. We have the prospects of the China Harbour Engineering Company coming in and building a three square kilometer port city adjacent to our port which hopefully will become down south business district in the next decade. That I think will crucially link Colombo and indeed the whole Sri Lanka to the global value chain. Colombo has tremendous prospects to go forward and it has all the elements needed to be a great futuristic city. The real issue is can we enact and implement effective policies to make that happen” he commented.
Colombo Mayor A. J. M. Muzammil said his aim is to develop Colombo as the smartest, greenest, and most sustainable city of Asia.
“The city of Colombo has become one of the fastest growing cities in the South Asia. It has built up close international relationships. During the next 10-20 years 70 percent of the population will be moving to the major cities. The cities have to gear to face this challenge” he said.
