Addalaichenai Ayurvedic Base Hospital commences acupuncture treatment

For the first time in the history of the Addalaichenai Ayurvedic Base Hospital, an acupuncture treatment system was inaugurated by the hospital Medical Officer-in-Charge Dr. K. M. Aslam at the Addalaichenai Ayurvedic Base Hospital, recently.
Conditions like arthritis, diabetes, bloating, headache, numbness in limbs, hair fall, stress, and acne, are curable through acupuncture.
The acupuncture clinic would be held twice a month from 9.00 am to 12 noon. About 25 patients could be treated per day, Dr. K. M. Aslam further said.
Appointments for treatment could be granted only on the days mentioned above, and no appointments would be given in advance, he said.
The treatment would be performed only by Dr. K. M. Aslam, Non-Communicable Diseases Doctor-in-charge Dr. Farvin Mohideen, and Dr. Fasmina Aroos.
