Geetha to appeal ruling

Galle District Parliamentarian Geetha Kumarasinghe yesterday, said that she will file an appeal against the Court of Appeal verdict disqualifying her from holding a seat in Parliament.
Kumarasinghe while urging her supporters not to panic stressed that she cannot be barred from Parliament until the verdict is given by the apex court. “That will be an injustice caused to the people who attended the Galle Face May Day rally,” she added.
