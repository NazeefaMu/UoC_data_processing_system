Lotus road closed owing to a protest

 
Lotus road is closed from the Galle Face roundabout owing to a protest led by the Inter University Students Federation (IUSF), Inter University Bikkhu Federation and the Inter Medical Faculty Students' Action Committee.
The protest has reportedly hampered traffic in Maradana.
The Colombo Fort Magistrate ordered university students to stage the demonstration without disrupting pedestrians and vehicle movement in Colombo Fort earlier today.
Furthermore they were ordered to refrain from entering into government establishments forcefully, disrupting peace and order.
The protest is against legalizing the South Asian Institute of Technology and Medicine (SAITM).
