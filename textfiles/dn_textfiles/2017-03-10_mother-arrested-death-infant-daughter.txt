Mother  arrested for death of infant daughter

A woman resident in Wehigala, Negollamada, Matale was arrested on suspicion by the Matale Police for killing her six month old infant daughter Gardi Hewage Seja Niyathya by assaulting her with a mammoty on March 6.
The arrest was made following the post mortem held by Matale Hospitla JMO Dr D L Waidyaratne who reported that death was caused due to an attack with a blunt weapon. Police said that since doctors reported that the suspect mother is suffering from a mental disorder, she was ordered to be hospitalized. She was due to be produced before the Matale Magistrate yesterday.
Investigations are continuing.
