Sharp dip in vehicle registrations in April

Vehicle registrations saw a sharp dip in April 2017 with electric car registration falling by almost 50% from March while both brand-new and pre-owned hybrid registrations too fell.
Brand-new motor cars decreased while the small car segment share jumped to 93% from 58% in the previous month. The financing share for brand-new motor cars increased slightly to 53.8% from 50.8% last month. The two-wheeler segment saw 26,089 registrations, a 12.5% decrease from last month, while two-wheelers less than 130CC saw a drop in segment share from 84% to 78%.
However three-wheelers observed a 12% growth from month to month. Pre-owned motor cars also observed a decline while premium motor cars registrations too declined. Overall vans were down due mostly to the pre-owned segment observing a drop; however brand new vans were slightly up.
