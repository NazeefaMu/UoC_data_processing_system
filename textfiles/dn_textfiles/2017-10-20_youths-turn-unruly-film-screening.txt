Youths turn unruly at film screening

Anuradhapura Police on Wednesday night dispersed a group of unruly youths who had come to watch a special show of a Tamil film which was screened for Deepavali.
Police said that this group comprising 15 members are residents of Medawachchiya, Ikirigollewa and Nachchadoowa. A large crowd watched the 6.30 pm show of the film.
This group who came to watch the 9.30 pm show had an altercation with the cashier resulting in a rumpus when the police arrived at the scene.
However, the youths fled when a senior police officer who had come there ordered his fellow officers to arrest them.
