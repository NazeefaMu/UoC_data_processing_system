N. M. M. Naheem, the Chairman Home Center, said that he started his business when he was 19 years from Kandy, as a jeweler in Kandy for almost two decades ago with his own lapidary. “I saw a great vacuum for need of quality furniture for both households as well as the leisure industry and then diversified in to the furniture business and opened a store in Nawala Road, Nugegoda.

“Today we house the latest furniture models that match houses, hotels, function halls, offices. These handmade furniture was an instant success and today most of the leading hotels especially boutique hotels use my furniture. In addition I also a strong repeater customer base who are satisfied with our price, 30 year guarantee and service.”

Naheem, said that they are different from others since they sell uncommon, impressive designs which I select from Indonesia. I travel four times a year to Indonesia to meet my suppliers.
