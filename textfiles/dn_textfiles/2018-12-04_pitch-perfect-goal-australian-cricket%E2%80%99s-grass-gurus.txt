Pitch perfect goal for Australian cricket’s grass gurus

SYDNEY: Mostly green and often downtrodden, the humble grass on which the highly-anticipated Australia-India Tests will be played doesn't normally attract as many headlines as superstars Virat Kohli and Mitchell Starc.
Yet the turf on Australia's ovals can play a critical role in determining the outcome of the highly-anticipated four-Test series, which begins in Adelaide on Thursday, and is often the subject of fierce debate among players, pundits and fans.
It all serves to turn up the heat on the curators -- the behind-the-scenes gods of the field -- who delve into the depths of horticultural science to engineer the ground carefully for each format of the game.
Adam Lewis joined the exclusive club when he became just the ninth curator of the Sydney Cricket Ground (SCG) a year ago, taking over from Tom Parker who retired after two decades.
Matt Page assumed the prestigious role at the Melbourne Cricket Ground (MCG) late last year after five years at Perth's WACA Ground. Both are aware of the public's high expectations after predecessors came under fire for their pitches.

The world-famous MCG was slammed by critics and received an official “poor” rating from the International Cricket Council -- the first time for an Australian pitch -- after the Ashes Boxing Day Test almost a year ago.
The governing body said it did not change over the five days of the match against England, giving neither batsmen nor bowlers a chance to seize control of the match, which ended in a tedious draw.
The outcry reflected just how important the pitch is to players, fans and administrators who have invested time -- and lots of money -- to watch a dramatic contest. Despite the immense pressure, the curators are focused on the root of their jobs -- nurturing the plants and trying to get the best out of them every time. The 170-year-old SCG, alongside Brisbane's The Gabba, is only one of two major Australian grounds left using a traditional pitch, which remains in the ground and is adjusted for different sports and seasons. By contrast, the MCG uses a drop-in pitch that is tended to and AFP
