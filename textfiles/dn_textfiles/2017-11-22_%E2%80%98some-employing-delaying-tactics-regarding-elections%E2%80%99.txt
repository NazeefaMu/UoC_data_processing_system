‘Some employing delaying tactics regarding elections’

The Collective of Election Monitoring Organizations yesterday charged that the writ petition filed by six electors challenging the legality of the Gazette notification on Local Government delimitations is also a part of the government’s agenda in postponing elections.
Addressing the media yesterday at the Centre for Society and Religion in Maradana, PAFFREL Executive Director Rohana Hettiarachchi said a politically motivated group of six people from different districts had gone to the Court of Appeal and are challenging the delimitation report.
He questioned whether these people give their opinions during the delimitation process, adding that the committee went around the country to obtain people’s views.
He further said the committee has issued its report nine months ago. But none of these individuals had given opinions to the delimitation committee.
Therefore, it is clear why they are challenging the delimitation report at this time, he said.
“The Elections Commission clearly stated that they are going to hold elections in January. That is why this politically motivated group filed a petition with the intention of delaying elections. All political parties, including the UNP, SLFP and JVP claim that they are not opposed to holding elections.
“We respect these individuals’ right to file a petition if they are attempting to seek justice and we are ready to take their side if they are being discriminated,” Hettiarachchi said.
Addressing the gathering, CaFFE Executive Director Keerthi Thennakoon alleged that the five individuals who filed the petition had close connections with some powerful SLFPers and the Local Government Minister is also making various attempts to postpone elections.
This petition is scheduled to take up for hearing at the Court of Appeal today.
