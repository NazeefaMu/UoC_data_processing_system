Biomass Terminal opens in Homagama

A Biomass Terminal was inaugurated last evening in Homagama, Colombo, by Deputy Minister of Power and Renewable Energy Ajith P. Perera.
The Sri Lanka Sustainable Energy Authority of the Ministry of Power and Renewable Energy is implementing the Global Environment Facility (GEF) funded Project on Promoting Sustainable Biomass Energy Production and Modern Bio-Energy Technologies with the support of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) and the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP).
The goal of the project is to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from fossil fuel used for thermal energy generation in the Sri Lankan industrial sector by removing barriers to the realization of sustainable biomass plantation. It also aims to adopt and improve biomass-based energy technologies.
Addressing the gathering at the inauguration of the biomass terminal, Deputy Minister of Power and Renewable Energy Ajith P. Perera stated: “I am confident that through the establishment of this biomass terminal, we can not only ensure that we have clean energy, but also safeguard our forests.”
Speaking on the partnership between the stakeholders to contribute to the biomass energy sector, Ms. Lovita Ramguttee, Deputy Country Director, UNDP Sri Lanka stated, “Over the past 50 years, we have been a key development partner for the Government of Sri Lanka and we remain committed to helping the country achieve sustainable human development. We are working both through UNDP-led initiatives and through inter-agency collaboration within the wider UN system through projects such as this, to help achieve the vision for a greener and sustainable Sri Lanka.”
Also addressing the gathering, Ms. Nina Brandstrup, Sri Lanka Representative, FAO, Sri Lanka stated, “Wood energy can make a worthy contribution to economic growth and create ‘green’ job opportunities, clean enterprises and improve living standards in rural areas. FAO is pleased to be a part of this project to contribute towards a greener Sri Lanka.”
The establishment of the terminal in Homagama is part of this endeavour. With the capacity to generate 40 MT of processed and high-quality biomass fuel per day, this terminal will operate as a collection and distribution centre of biomass energy, even out demand and supply fluctuations, and play an important role in the long-term sustainability of the biomass energy sector, according to a Media release
