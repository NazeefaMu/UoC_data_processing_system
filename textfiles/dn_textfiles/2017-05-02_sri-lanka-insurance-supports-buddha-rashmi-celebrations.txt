Sri Lanka Insurance supports Buddha Rashmi celebrations

Sri Lanka Insurance has come forward to support the Buddha Rashmi Jathika Vesak Mangalya 2017, organised by the Gangarama Temple in Hunupitiya, Colombo 2, at the Prime Minister’s Office.
Sri Lanka Insurance will be a sponsor to the many commemorative activities to be carried out by the Gangarama in connection with the Buddha Rashmi programme which would take place from May 10 to 14.
The sponsorship cheque was handed over to Gangarama by the Buddhist Association and Trade Union members of SLI recently. Ven. Dr. Kirinde Assaji Thera of the Gangarama Temple and Ministers Faiszer Musthapha P.C. and Ranjith Madduma Bandara are seen here on the occasion with the SLI representatives.
Worthy of mention is that Trade Unions of all leading political parties are represented in the delegation and signifies shedding of differences to unite for a good cause.
