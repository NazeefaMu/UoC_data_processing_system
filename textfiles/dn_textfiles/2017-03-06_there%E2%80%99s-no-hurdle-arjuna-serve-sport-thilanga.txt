There’s no hurdle for Arjuna to serve sport - Thilanga

SLC president Thilanga Sumathipala has extended a hand of friendship and invited Arjuna Ranatunga the 1996 World Cup winning captain to provide his services to uplift Sri Lanka cricket.
“I have no objection towards Arjuna coming to help,” said Sumathipala acknowledging Ranatunga’s vast knowledge and experience.
“We have about nine out of 14 of the 1996 World Cup winning team working with us. Aravinda, Sanath, Romesh, Hashan, Vaas, Upul Chandana and now Gurusinha,” said Sumathipala.
“All of them are highly talented. Kumar Dharmasena is an international umpire, Roshan Mahanama was a renowned ICC Match Referee. Even before them players like Ranjith Fernando and Hemantha Devapriya too did a great service,” he said.
“During my previous tenure as SLC president Aravinda and Arjuna both played for the national team. I was the vice president when we won the World Cup. Arjuna has an enormous amount of knowledge and experience. He can do a great service again. I have no objection in inviting him to render his services towards building up the team.
“There is no restriction for that. Lots of cricketers honour him and there is no question about his experience,” Sumathipala stated.
Ranatunga has been a heavy critic of Sumathipala for his alleged connections with the betting industry and has said that he should not hold the post of SLC president. At the last SLC elections Sumathipala was voted in unanimously as president while Ranatunga contesting the post of vice president lost.
