We have been outplayed in  every facet of the game: Smith

 
Australia’s disenchanted captain Steve Smith was at a loss for words to explain his team’s 0-3 whitewash at the hands of seventh ranked Sri Lanka.
“It’s a hard one to grasp really, it’s been a very tough series again, this is our third straight whitewash loss in the subcontinent,” lamented Smith at the post match press conference.
“What we are doing isn’t working, batters aren’t adapting to the conditions, spin bowlers aren’t adapting to the conditions, I can’t fault our quicks, they did a great job, particularly Mitchell Starc, but our batters and spinners are the ones who have to step up and we haven’t been able to do that.
“We have been outplayed in every facet of the game, our plans haven’t worked as individuals or as a collective group, we haven’t been able to put Sri Lanka under as much pressure as we would have liked,” he said.
“In these conditions it is the spinners’ job to get the majority of the wickets as the Sri Lankan spinners did, we just haven’t been able to do that.”
Smith was full of praise for Rangana Herath who took 28 wickets in the series and played an integral part in their defeats.
“He’s a very tough character to face, he’s always at you, he’s always at your stumps, he changes his pace beautifully and bowls from different parts of the crease, changes his angles up.
“You never really get a freebie off him or an easy boundary. You always have to work for your runs, which is important as a left-arm finger spinner to the right handed batsmen in particular. He is a terrific bowler in these conditions and he has had a magnificent series.” – ST
