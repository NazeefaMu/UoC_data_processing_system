Security by Obscurity

Belt Road initiative and cyber security:
After investigation, the police arrested a 17-year old school boy on suspicion of hacking into the President's official website in November last year. The school boy, who made his claim as "The Sri Lankan Youth", posted a message on the website demanding a Presidential election immediately, if Sirisena was unable to address his demand of not changing the examination dates to April, the month most Sri Lankans celebrate traditional New Year.
The Criminal Investigation Department (CID) officials arrested the boy in connection with the hacking and he was produced before the Courts, but later President Maithripala Sirisena, met with the student who hacked into his official website. During his meeting with the schoolboy hacker, the President said: ‘It's our duty to encourage our youngsters to use their talents ethically. If the President had not invited the schoolboy hacker to meet him, perhaps his life would have been ruined and the boy would have had to spend his life in Prison.
Being a young, creative boy, this hacker got away due to the understanding of the President in Colombo, but had it happened anywhere else in the world, he would have been in serious trouble as hackers are dealt with in the most strict manner.
Last week, the world was shocked with a statement apparently made by the government of Qatar. Investigators believe that hackers had breached Qatar's state news agency and planted a fake news report that contributed to the crisis. This sort of incidents happen all over the world. Similarly, Edward Snowden, had leaked documents revealing extensive U.S. government surveillance. Computer hacking often revolves around information. Organisations steal information such as research, financial reports and more from one another through hacking operations. Such loss of information to a small business may cost them dearly as they could lose their competitive edge or result in the complete loss of a client base, effectively ruining the organisation.
A bill giving the UK intelligence agencies and police the most sweeping surveillance powers in the western world was passed into law with barely a whimper, meeting only token resistance over the past year from inside parliament and barely any from outside. The Investigatory Powers Act, passed in 2016, legalizes a whole range of tools for snooping and hacking by the security services unmatched by any other country in Western Europe or even the US. Sri Lankan sectoral experts are highly focused how to control the hacker’s activity. Next week the second conference of the CICA non-Governmental forum will be held in Beijing. Pathfinder Foundation will also participate in this valuable event and representatives will discuss the Asian Security Situation: Assessment and Prospect. The participants will discuss the critically important subject of Digital Gap and Network Security. Belt and Road Initiative, is a development strategy proposed by Chinese President Xi Jinping that focuses on connectivity and cooperation between Eurasian countries, primarily the People's Republic of China, the land-based "Silk Road Economic Belt" and the oceangoing "Maritime Silk Road". The strategy underlines China's push to take a larger role in global affairs, and the desire to coordinate manufacturing capacity with other countries. In this regard, China with Eurasian countries face a backdrop of fears of cyber-attacks.
Digital divide is a term that refers to the gap between demographics and regions that have access to modern information and communication technology. This technology can include the telephone, television, personal computers and the Internet. Before the late 20th century, digital divide referred chiefly to the division between those with and without telephone access; after the late 1990s however, the term began to be used mainly to those with and without Internet access, particularly broadband.
The digital divide typically exists between those in cities and those in rural areas; between the educated and the uneducated; between socioeconomic groups; and, globally, between the more and less industrially developed nations. Even among populations with some access to technology, the digital divide can be evident in the form of lower-performance computers, lower-speed wireless connections, lower-priced connections such as dial-up, and limited access to subscription-based content.
The topic of discussion on the world clearly admits the fact that there is a digital gap in countries where economic and technological development has been progressing in the past at a slower pace. And therefore, the issue of cyber security is critically important to such developing countries including Sri Lanka. Although we believe that cyber security is more of an issue of lack of technological or economic development, sometimes it not only a problem in the developed countries. Recent highly publicized claims in USA and a few other developed countries demonstrate the vulnerability of even the most advanced countries and their highly sensitive digital infrastructure. If the Americans and the British cannot defend or protect their most crucial internet related structures almost all other developing and even developed countries are most likely vulnerable to the cyber security related breaches.
The Hiscox Cyber Readiness Report 2017, published recently surveyed 3,000 companies across three countries to assess their readiness to deal with cyber-crime in terms of strategy, resourcing, technology and process. The report found 53 percent of the companies assessed were ill-prepared to deal with an attack, and just 30 percent were rated "expert" in their overall cyber readiness. In 2016, "cyber-crime cost the global economy over $450 billion, where over 2 billion personal records were stolen and in the U.S. alone, over 100 million Americans had their medical records stolen,". Global statistics indicate that 75 percent of cyber incidents against critical infrastructure is all international. More interestingly, this data identifies that the most advanced G20 countries lose 1 percent of their GDP per annum due to cyber-crimes.
Therefore, the vulnerability of less developed economies needs no exaggeration. What do we mean by cyber security? As per one definition, Cyber security or information technology security are the techniques of protecting computers, networks, programmes and data from unauthorized access or attacks that are aimed for exploitation.
The major areas covered in cyber security are: Application Security, Information Security, Disaster recovery and Network Security. In this regard, we have to remember that where ever cyber security aspects are to be addressed solutions must address both software and hardware issues. In countries like Sri Lanka, at the current level of economic and technological development, it is hard to assume that we can ourselves manage at an individual country level. We need international expertise, a high standard of digital technology and above all structures so that immediate action can be implemented when and where security breaches take place.
Belt and Road Initiative and The Belt and Road, is a development strategy proposed land-based "Silk Road Economic Belt" and the oceangoing "Maritime Silk Road". The strategy underlines China's push to take a larger role in global affairs, and the desire to coordinate manufacturing capacity with other countries.The One Belt One Road Initiative offers a great opportunity for China and regional countries to deepen economic trade and cooperation, cultural and personnel communication and connectivity. However, the security risks could impact the implementation of the Initiative. Meanwhile, the Chinese leadership and leaderships of all connected countries interacted frequently, which injected new impetus into the friendly bilateral relations. Importantly, people-to-people exchanges could serve as a cornerstone for bilateral relations between China and these countries. Therefore we need to strengthen contact, relationship and human interest of every citizen.
The Pathfinder Foundation in Colombo carried out a productive business and people friendly promotion mission to China with the establishment of the Eminent Persons’ Advisory Council comprising senior personalities from both countries. The council has set up technical sub-committees to realize the spirit of the MoU in such areas as strengthening economic, political, strategic and cultural relations. Taking the above situation into consideration, we have to propose that the countries that have come together as well as others involved in the Think Tank Network, identify cyber security as an area to work together. In this effort China as a technologically and economically most advanced nation in the world, could extend its technological support backed by experts in the cyber security field.
