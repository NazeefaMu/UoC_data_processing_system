New heart valves, tissue bank at LRH opened

The new bank of heart valves and tissues constructed at the Lady Ridgeway Hospital for Children at Borella at a cost of Rs. 100 million was opened by Health Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne recently.
Minister Senaratne speaking at the ceremony thanked the Rotary Club for assisting the project. Heart surgeries at the hospital commenced in 2007 but the hospital faced difficulties in finding heart valves to carry out transplants and an artificial heart valve cost it Rs. 300,000.
Minister Senaratne said the tissue bank was proposed to construct in 2012 but it did not happen due to lack of funds. In 2014, the Cabinet approval was granted to build the tissue bank.
Now children undergoing heart surgeries at the hospital would receive human heart valves free of charge. Ven. Bandagiriye Somawansha Thera, officials from the Rotary Club, Health Ministry and others were present.
