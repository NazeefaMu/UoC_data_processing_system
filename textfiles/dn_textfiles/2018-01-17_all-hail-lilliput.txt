All hail Lilliput!

Cute Lilliput is one little dog who certainly has the bow-wow factor. The Maltese has become a supermodel of the canine world and huge on ­social media.
Since her talents came to light at a dog show seven years ago, the eight-year-old pooch has amassed more than 100,000 ­followers on Instagram .
She has a ­nutritionist, chef, ­homeopath and trainer on hand to take care of her every need. Lilliput works with top brands such as River Island and celebs ­including the Pet Shop Boys.
Her owner Marianne, from North London, said: “I was searching for a Maltese puppy and was offered one from a top breeder who won the breed’s category at Crufts every year.
“When I got her as a puppy, little did I know Lills had ideas about making me fit round her vanity and self-promotional needs.”
Although the posts are tongue-in-cheek, Lilliput has had hours of careful training.
She can sit, down, stay, come, high-5, gimme-10, raise a paw and kick a ball. She has perfected her head-over-the-shoulder modelling look and can count to 10 in woofs.
Lilliput holds poses to have her ­picture taken and works happily with humans she doesn’t know. Marianne says: “Her followers increased when people began to appreciate it’s all a social media ­commentary spoof. Lilliput would say her posts are random ­ moments in her perfect glamorous life which she just happened to capture off the cuff. The reality is she puts in more effort than the Beckhams and Kardashians combined.”
Lilliput’s followers are mainly women of all ages and are known as Lilliputians. They are mostly American but she also has fans in the UK, Europe, Australia and Singapore.
Marianne says: “Most followers understand the humour and enjoy laughing at the parody.
“Behind every manufactured ­moment are hours of filtering, airbrushing, cropping and bribing with fish treats to set unrealistic ­standards of cuteness for her followers in the artificial world of social media.”
