SLC president’s visit to Kandy

The newly elected president of Sri Lanka Cricket Thilanga Sumathipala was in Kandy last Sunday. He first paid homage to the Sri Dalada Maligawa, where he was received by the Diyawadene Nilame and undertook religious observation. Thereafter, he drove to the Pallekelle International. Cricket Stadium and looked around the facilities that were available and that needed improvement.
On his inspection he first wanted to stop all work on the indoor net which is being built in the center of the car park. What cricket lovers can see are only the pillars and all other work is at a halt. This indoor net commenced during the term of the interim committee without a proper plan or a constructive proposal. Further they had failed to obtain authority for the land acquired from the state. It appeared that everything was virtually disorganized and without proper authority.
If one sees the amount of funds spent on this ground, it would seem very high, and a colossal amount of funds has been spent without justification to what has been undertaken. Everything that has been done at this venue has been at a very high financial expense, even the chairs supplied for this venue for the tiers are of a poor quality but priced very high. So, the new president has pledged that he is all out to put things in order, and has promised his best in due course.
He said that Sri Lanka Cricket is in the red right now, but was confident that he was capable of putting everything in place as soon as possible for the betterment of Sri Lanka Cricket.
Sumathipala also met a few of the Kandy District Cricket Association officials and some club representatives. He had talks with them too. Later he visited the Old Trinitians Sports Club at Asgiriya, which is housed at the Trinity College International Stadium.
Today, what the cricket lovers of Kandy need is club cricket to be brought back to where it was, and also give a helping hand to the clubs to play domestic cricket.
Kandy needs a good ground for school matches - only three schools out of ten have grounds to play matches and for practices.
However the schools are doing well at cricket because the game is promoted in the right way whereas the clubs have failed.
Cricket has a long history in Kandy, a game which has been played over here since 1863. It was mainly played in the Knuckes/Rangala areas and the Kandy city had the Kandy Dancing, Boating, and Rowing Club. In 1896 this club became the Kandy Sports Club.
The country’s first unofficial test was played in Kandy at Bogambara grounds in 1889. In August 1946 saw the revival of the Kandy District Association. Shortly after the Central Province Cricket Association was formed and that is the year Dr V.H.L. Anthonisz Shield was established for competition amongst clubs in the Kandy District.
Asgiriya Stadium is the private property of Trinity College Kandy and it became Sri Lanka's second Test venue after the P Sara Oval, when it hosted Greg Chappell’s’ Australian team in 1983. Then came the Pallekele Stadium which is owned by Sri Lanka Cricket.
The Pallekele International Stadium was the brainchild of former Minister of Sports & Tourism and present Minister of Highways and Higher education Lakshman Kiriella. He initiated it when he was the Sports Minister.
