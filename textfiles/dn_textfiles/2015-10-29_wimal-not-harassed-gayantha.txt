Wimal not harassed - Gayantha

UPFA MP Wimal Weerawansa was not subjected to any political harassment over his passport controversy, Parliamentary Reforms and Media Minister and Cabinet Spokesman Gayantha Karunathilake said.
He was responding to a question by a journalist at the Cabinet press briefing at the Information Department yesterday.
The minister observed the way the government handled the passport issue of MP Weerawansa was a proof that it did not take revenge on political opponents.
"We have seen that this kind of affair had been used by previous governments to restrain the activities of political opponents. In contrast, MP Weerawansa had even thanked the Prime Minister for looking into the matter immediately after it was raised in Parliament by MP Dinesh Gunawardena. However, the Prime Minister's involvement was limited to the privilege matter of the MP, and he did not meddle in the legal process with regard to the matter," he said.
