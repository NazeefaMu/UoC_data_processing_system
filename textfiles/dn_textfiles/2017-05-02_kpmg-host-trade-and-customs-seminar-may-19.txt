Customs valuation of imported goods, impacts the liability of border taxes and also the importers’ compliance with statutory requirements.
The strategic focus of the seminar is to provide an overview of Customs valuation rules, provisions on enforcement, practical applications and valuation dispute settlement. Customs valuation rules are based on General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) for purposes of Customs. Sri Lankan importers have experienced many dynamics in relation to motor vehicle imports.
The world’s global standard for classifying goods in international trade i.e. the H.S Nomenclature; 2017 Edition will enter into force in May 2017 in Sri Lanka.
The main objective of the seminar is to create awareness on the recent amendments to H.S Code classifications and its impact on admissibility of goods, duties payable and eligibility for differential treatment under different Trade Agreements. The 2017 Edition of H.S Nomenclature includes amendments to the agricultural, construction and transport sectors.
Foreign exchange impact on international trade has been changing over the years in Sri Lanka. Foreign exchange was introduced in Sri Lanka by the Colonial rulers before the country gained its independence and since then many developments have taken place in the Exchange Control regime impacting importers, exporters and authorized dealers including banks. The seminar will cover current implications and recent developments in relation to foreign exchange rules.
