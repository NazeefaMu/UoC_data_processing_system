Contemporary Management Techniques for Local Film Industry

The famous film director, producer Stephen Spielberg once described Sri Lanka as a hidden treasure and a paradise isle consisting of varied climatic conditions, greenery, breathtaking beaches, waterfalls, mountains and plantations.
He was also convinced that Sri Lanka could be tagged as an ideal film location at a relatively lower cost. The international film producers, directors selected Sri Lanka as their film production location for films like Mother Theresa, Water and Bombay Velvet ahead of other countries.
In much earlier times, Bridge over river Kwai, Indiana Jones and the temple of doom, Jungle book, Sooryawansham, Pilot Premnath and more films were produced here on exotic locations.
Talking about Bridge over River Kwai, the film was based on a story in world war 2and was an academy award winning film. The great film director David Lean selected the location of Kitulgala close to Avissawella in Sri Lanka.
The film also shows Mount Lavinia Hotel which was a hospital to treat injured British soldiers in Sri Lanka during the war times. Those films also had leading actors/actresses in the likes of William Holden(Bridge over river Kwai), Amitabh Bachchan (Sooryawansham),Harrison Ford (Indiana jones), Sivaji Ganeshan(Pilot Premnath),Ranbir Kapoor, the grand son of Raj Kapoor (Bombay Velvet) and other Indian idols like Rajendra Kumar, Amrish Puri, Gulshan Grover to name a few.
Bombay Velvet was shot in Ranminitenna, Colombo, Galle and also in Passikudah which also starred the present Bollywood actress Anoushka Sharma.
The film locations in Sri Lanka have still not been fully tapped by the international film production companies. We have breathtaking mountains, sandy beaches, caves, green paddy fields, forests, colonial and modern hotels, ancient buildings and railway stations, religious places of worship, wild life and bird parks, gardens, domestic international airports, universities educational establishments, horse racing and golf tracks, sports grounds, shopping malls and almost all types of other locations to suit the needs of any film production company in the world.
Our own local film production companies need be given incentives to attract foreign based production teams for film production in Sri Lanka.
Development of studios
International film production could be turned into a top foreign currency earning avenue for Sri Lanka tourism if handled efficiently. We have more film production studios other than Ranminitenna. Development of those studios with latest equipment and facilities will lure great demand for international film shooting units as we have more outdoor locations as well. Our own actors actresses, film production companies, music directors, sound recordists, cameramen, makeup artistes and even our directors will find gainful employment and earning avenues with international film production companies coming to Sri Lanka for film production. Many Sri Lankan artistes found opportunities to act in foreign films, namely, Iranganie Serasinghe, Malini Fonseka, D.R. Nanayakkara, Denawaka Hamine and many others. Our film, directors and artistes have won many awards in the recent past at international film festivals held at prestigious locations.
Our own Jaqueline Fernandez took the Bollywood by storm with her stunning appearances. We have plenty of film artistes who are fluent in English and in other languages. Our film artistes who have returned from their long stays abroad can contribute to the cause of attracting overseas film directors and production companies or could enter into joint venture productions with them. International actors of Sri Lankan origin include Albert Moses who played the role of Ranjeet in the “Mind your language” series in UK, M.G. Ramachandran, A.E. Manoharan and Alston Koch comes to my mind. Jaqueline Fernandez is a cut above the rest and is a mega Bollywood star.
Pooja Umashankar from South India has now secured a permanent place in the Sri Lanka cinema.
A film could be easily shot in Sri Lanka in its entirety making use of all facilities available within a period of 30 to 45 days if any producer/director wishes. Our latest film production studio Ranminitenna located in Hambantota possess all facilities to make different sets for different scenes. Film production is an area which the tourism authorities could tap to bring in high net worth spenders to the country as international film budgets are quite high and the producers can save substantial funds by shooting the film in Sri Lanka.
This will be a win situation for both Sri Lanka and the film producer. Major Western film producing groups include 20th century fox, paramount pictures, united artistes, Columbia pictures, Metro Goldwyn Meyer, Golden Harvest, Sony pictures Entertainment and a number of other new comers. Great North Indian producer groups families include Sippy, Nadiadwala, KaranJohar, Bonny Kapoor, the Roshan family, Dhawans, Amir Khan productions, R.K. Films and a host of others. I strongly believe that direct approaches to above named would bring in fruitful results. We must send out the message to the world film production companies that Sri Lanka is a top film shooting location in the world. In addition to Ranminitenna two other film production villages could be set up in two other locations, ideally in the hill country and a destination closer to Colombo like Avissawella or Negombo on a joint venture basis with a foreign film production company.
In the sixtees many North Indian film stars visited Sri Lanka for premiere show of many Hindi films in which they acted. Some of them include Dev Anand and Nutan . Nutan’s sister and a top actress in the sixties and seventies Tanuja even acted in a Sinhala film. Tanuja is the mother of top Bollywood actress Kajol. The IIFFA event, the pinnacle festival of North Indian cinema was held in 2010 in Colombo drawing many Bollywood artistes both young and old into our country. This event created the gate opening for many Hindi films to be shot in Sri Lanka.
Sri Lanka artistes won many international awards very specially in the last decade at international film festivals held. All these award winning actors, actresses, directors and others entered the hall of fame of Sri Lankan cinema by bagging international awards.
The pioneers of Sri Lankan film production include Lester James Pieris, Sumithra Pieris, K. Gunaratnam of cinemas fame, Robin Tampoe, K.A.W. Perera, E.A.P. Edirisinghe,Titus Thotawatte and Herbert M. Seneviratne. At the maturity stage value addition was done by Chandran Ratnam, Soma Edirisinghe, Milina Sumathipala, Sunil Ariyaratne, Robin Fernando, Asoka Perera, Prasanna Vithanage, Somaratne Dissanayake and a host of others. Sri Lanka now boast of an advanced film industry which could match any international production. Chandran Ratnam’s contribution in bringing foreign production units to Sri Lanka during the last three decades is commendable. Our film industry is in need of more private and state sector assistance. Our corporate conglomerates should venture out into local and international film production which would pay rich dividends in time to come.
Types of films range from Adventure, religious, historical, war, sciencefiction, comedy, horror, country and western, action and so on. The sky is the limit for the film industry. However, the story and cast are of paramount importance. The state film corporation is required to assist all producers and directors who produced award winning films for Sri Lanka at international festivals. In this respect it is prudent to appoint a few corporate sector magnates to the director board of state film corporation. At least one film hall in every major city of this country be brought to international standards. Even foreigners will come and watch local movies for relaxation, provided the films have English subtitles. Cinema owners could provide a separate box for foreigners at least in major screening halls at a higher price may be at 10 us dollars so that they need not mix with locals.
Entertainment taxes
The travel agents and hoteliers could prepare their itineraries to enable visitors to watch a local film at comfort in between tired journeys. All entertainment taxes should be reduced for film exhibitors to enable them to earn higher profits.
The film corporation should have regular monthly meetings with local film producers and directors for reaching mutual agreements on dates of screening, government taxes, incentives and facilities required, welfare of all film artistes and the proposals of film producers conducive to the advancement of our film industry. The pricing of tickets for the public is another matter for discussion as ticket prices have soared over the years depriving the common man to see a film at a cinema hall like the good old days to at least stay away from their day to day troubles at least for a few hours. There is another school of thought that the outstanding teledramas of the eighties should be turned into films. Good examples are teledramas like Palingu Menike, Yashorawaya, Baladevagelokaya, Tharadevi, Meniknadiya Gala Basi, Ellalangawalauwa and many others. These teledramas have powerful stories and true to life situations. I am sure once converted into films these teledrama will hit the international platform in no time.
For the benefit of all film producers, directors and others who wish to produce films, given below is a list of pre requisites for making a successful film both in terms of revenue earning capacity and popularity.
1. The story of the film
2. Dynamic cast
3. Film locations
4. Efficient, skilled and punctual production crew
5. Use of Latest production equipment
6. Uninterrupted production schedules
7. A network of shooting schedule for completion of film in time
8. Preparation of an accurate overall budget with breakup of costs for different phases
9. Establishment of cost centres
10. Establishment of responsibility centres
11. Strong dialogue to suit the individual scenes
12. Methodical screenplay
13. A Skilled and visionary director
14. Rigid budgetary control with accounting, financial and costing systems
15. An internal audit to checkon the progress of the film every fortnight
16. Accurate weather forecasting
17. Eye catching costumes and attire to match the individual scenes
18. Background music to the scenes and scintillating songs if required
19. Good facilities for the film crew and artistes and proper medical and transport, food and lodging
20. Selection of reputed guest artistes
21. Proper legally binding contracts with all involved in the production of the film
22. Local and Worldwide film distribution network
23. Timing of film release
24. Media coverage before, on and after film launch
25. Identification of audience before the film story/cast/location and other features are decided.
26. Marketing and promotional techniques
27. Simultaneous parallel screening releasing of films of other producers
28. Effecting progress payments to all as stipulated in contracts
29. Compliance with environmentallaws local by-laws at film locations
30. Efficient editing of the film
The above are only some criteria for a successful film. The acceptance and public rating of the film depends on a number of other factors such as social norms, film exhibition cinema halls and their quality and the variety fare offered. Disputes with film artistes and crew be avoided at all times as they form the nucleus of the film. Film script should be read by all artistes, production crew and others prior to signing of contracts and engaging them.
The film artistes and production units may require amendments to the script, scenes and locations to suit their performance. These amendments should be discussed with them in order to avoid misunderstandings and also to augment performance enhancement. Inter personal and inter group disputes be settled amicably with the view of early and successful completion of the film and also to save costs. Repeat shooting of scenes be avoided at all times as this will be a time consuming and costly exercise. Insurance cover to all artistes, film crew, equipment, vehicles, studios and other items is also important to minimize losses on mishaps during shooting, travelling and lodging at different places. External support staff should be carefully selected after auditions for individual scenes.
The returns from the contemporary film industry is quite high when compared to that of decades ago. Unlike a trading or manufacturing venture, experienced directors and producers know how to handle their films and procure above average returns. The Hollywood, Bollywood and Kollywood films are usually mega productions. The main actors and actresses are paid lavishly. They have a trying task of saving their taxes. They continually engage in sourcing investments which would offer them handsome returns. For example take the case of IPL franchises .Two main teams, namely, Kolkata Knightriders and Kings xi Punjab are controlled by actor Sharukh Khan and Preity Zinta respectively. They physically visit match venues and cheer for their teams. They now have the option of continuing with the franchise or selling them at a lucrative profit as it is extremely difficult to field a new team as most prominent states of India are in the competition. Along with above normal profits film producers in India face threats from extortionists or the so called “Gundahs” for protection money for which some producers secretly oblige while others ignore them and beef up their security. The film artistes especially the main actors and actresses are well aware that they can earn lavishly for a few years only as the film industry sources out a large number of film artistes for a year.
Some achieve the celebrity status from their first film itself while others will have to wait and bank on a good film. Local awards will be the first target for any film artiste before venturing out into international awards. Indian movie “Slumdog Millionaire” bagged a number of international awards rating highly in the overseas film circuit. Another Indian movie “Krrish” was requested by a number of American universities due to the story being associated with a human acquiring super powers through an alien.
International Awards
Some film idols enter the political scene once they quit acting while some others stars contest elections while they are still in the limelight. Good examples from Sri Lanka are Gamini Fonseka, Malini Fonseka, Niel Rupasinghe, Geetha Kumarasinghe and Ranjan Ramanayake. Due to their screen popularity they obtain votes of all sections of public, namely, youth, middle aged and elderly voters. When we look at India the following names comes to our mind. They are M.G. Ramachandran, Jayalalitha, Dharmendra, Sunil Dutt, Shatrughan Sinha, Vyjayanthimala and many others. From the Hollywood we find Ronald Reagan, Clint Eastwood and Arnold Schwarzenegger at the top. Even the present President Donald Trump has appeared in a few guest roles for a couple of films. It is the popularity of the artiste and their personality that would lead them to politics.
Talking about the film industry itself, the US film industry is over 120 years old while the Indian film industry is 103 years old. India is the largest producer of films in the world for a calendar year. Nigeria comes second and they resort to produce films in neighbouring African countries conducive for film production mainly for cost control and also for security reasons.
Collections wise the largest box office countries are USA, China, U.K., South Korea and India. The worldwide theatrical market has a box office of nearly us$ 40 billion for a year. Some producers receive various incentives and support to augment the revenue from films. For e ample, the recent release of “Kabali” starring famous actor Rajni Kanth received enhanced promotion through the corporate sector when some establishments permitted their staff to watch the film on the first day itself in Chennai and Bangalore. Some even declared a holiday on the day of release of the film. Unfortunately, in Sri Lanka our film releases are not supported by the state and private sector in any worthwhile assistance to boost the production of quality films in Sri Lanka.
State Film Corporation should include a couple of directors and the chairman from the blue chip private sector companies rather than the political appointees at all times since this is an industry where Sri Lanka receives global attention, promotion and recognition through high quality films with powerful stories and dynamic cast. I am sure these corporate sector directors will render voluntary services for the promotion of film industry in Sri Lanka.
Lastly, I wish to add that film production should not be aimed at hurting the feelings of followers of any religion or any section of the community. It is good to see Sri Lanka still following the restrictions on tobacco and alcohol. The film censoring board should consist of veterans in the industry and a few senior citizens of the society to maintain our religious, cultural and social norms. What we expect from a film is entertainment to take away the day to day blues of our people and not to instill fear, shame, humiliation and frustration which would further aggravate their daily life pattern.
