From crisis to sustenance – Part 21: Find a common purpose, to help others see themselves in the picture

Last week we began discussing Five Practices of Exemplary Leadership and the corresponding ten commitments of leadership. We analysed the first three in details. Today we continue with commitment numbers 4, 5 and 6.
Commitment no-04
Enlist others in a common vision by appealing to their interests, hopes, and dreams
Leadership is a relationship between those who aspire to lead and those who choose to follow. Leaders must master the dynamics of this relationship. They must learn how to mobilize others to want to struggle for shared aspirations. This means that leaders need to acquire the understanding, skills, and experience to collaborate successfully. Within this context, leaders move away from being the sole decision maker to involving others such as staff, and community members in the decision-making process.
Motivation is what drives individuals to work in the way they do to fulfil goals, needs or expectations. These are numerous, varied and changing.
Leaders can uplift people's spirits with an ennobling perspective about why they should strive to be better than they are today. This means that to create an organised movement as well as significant change, leaders need to enlist others. They also must appeal a shared aspiration because people will not follow until the vision is accepted as their own.
Leaders must speak others’ language to enlist them in a vision. Leaders not only understand people's needs but also have their interests at heart when they are to sign up for journeys into the future. Leaders breathe life into visions through vivid language and an effective style. Their own enthusiasm and excitement are contagious and spread from the leader to constituents. Their belief in and enthusiasm for the vision are the sparks that ignite the flame of inspiration.
In order to make their visions become true, leaders need to keep people focused and excited about the meaning and significance of their work. Leaders have to animate the vision and make manifest the purpose so that others can see it, hear it and feel it. It is not leader's dream alone but is the people's vision.
In order to accomplish this ideal, the leader needs to: foster collaboration by building trust and facilitating relationships, show trust to build trust, get people interacting to facilitate relationship, strengthen others by increasing self-determination and developing competence, increase individual accountability to enhance self-determination andoffer training support to develop competence.
Commitment no-05
Strengthen people by giving power away, providing choice, developing competence, assigning critical tasks, and offering visible support
Highly effective leaders do not get things done by issuing orders and directives to obedient underlings. Rather, they achieve success by unleashing the energy of the organization by creating an environment that generates a sense of commitment and engagement in their people. And they do this by giving away – not hoarding – the power and authority of their own positions.
Effective leaders recognize that people are motivated to work hard when they feel a sense of personal responsibility for effectively performing activities that they care about. But a sense of personal responsibility is impossible without a significant degree of autonomy. Effective leaders recognize this by empowering their subordinates – giving them plenty of room to exercise judgment and make decisions about how they get their work done.
But while delegation and empowerment are necessary conditions for effective leadership, they don't tell the whole story. Empowerment can actually lead to chaos if it is not accompanied by clarity from the leader regarding:
(1). Where we are going – the vision; 2. How we will get there – the strategy; (3). How we will conduct ourselves – the organization's core values
An effective leader must also ensure that people possess the knowledge and skills necessary to achieve what is expected of them. This in turn requires leaders to carefully select the right people, assign them to roles to which they're suited, and to ensure they have the right training, development and coaching to accomplish what is asked of them.
So, effective leaders realize that their role is to create the context for effective performance by those reporting to them. That means leaders must work hard to remove ambiguity for their subordinates regarding what they are trying to accomplish together (their vision), how they are going to move toward that vision (their strategy), and how they will conduct themselves on their journey together (their values). Leaders must also ensure that each member of their team also clearly understands their specific role and responsibilities. Once these factors are in place, effective leaders release the latent energy of the team by giving up formal power and authority by clearly delegating it to their team members.
Thinking of leadership effectiveness as giving up power and authority also provides insights regarding the downsides of charismatic leadership. While charismatic leaders can often be effective in the short run, they are rarely successful in creating teams and organizations that endure. Charismatic leaders create energy and enthusiasm based on their personal strengths and magnetism, but they often leave little room for others to exercise initiative or take responsibility for results.
Commitment no-06
Set the example by behaving in ways that are consistent with shared values
Exemplary leaders have strong beliefs about matters of principle. People expect their leaders to speak out on matters of values and conscience. Nevertheless, how can you speak out if you don’t know what’s important to you? How can you show you care if you don’t know what you care about? To earn and sustain personal credibility, you must find your voice by clarifying your personal values and expressing them in your own style. By finding your voice, you take the first step in the journey to becoming a leader. By asking yourself what value you bring to your constituents, you stay at the leading edge.
Leaders are clear about the values and motivations that drive them. Values serve as guides. By identifying your values, you find your voice. The clearer you are about your values, the easier it is for you to stay on the path you have chosen. Values inform your decisions about what to do, when to say “yes” and when to say “no,” and why you make those decisions.
Learn to express your values in a way that is genuinely and authentically you. You must authentically communicate your beliefs in ways that uniquely represent who you are. You must interpret the lyrics and shape them into your own presentation so that others recognize that you’re the one who’s singing.
Set the example
Clarity about personal values is part of modelling the way for others. If you stand for some personal set of values, then the only person you’ll be leading will be yourself. When you lead a group or organization, you have to move from “what I believe” to “what we believe.”
We can’t impose values from the top. It either leads to compliance or rebellion. Values cannot be forced. They must be forged. Being clear about personal values allows us to detect where there are shared values in the community.
Discovering values that can be shared is the foundation for building productivity and genuine working relationships. Although leaders honour the diversity of their constituencies, they also stress their common values. Leaders build on agreement. They don’t worry about getting everyone to be in accord.
Tremendous energy is generated when individual, group, and institutional values are aligned. Commitment, enthusiasm, and drive are intensified, as people have reasons for caring about their work. When we care about what we are doing, we are more effective and satisfied. We experience less stress. Shared values are the internal compasses that enable us to act independently and interdependently—simultaneously.
Align personal actions with shared values
The most powerful thing a leader can do to mobilize others is to set the example by aligning personal actions with shared values. Leaders show up, pay attention, and participate directly in getting extraordinary things done. They show others by their own example that they are deeply committed to the values and aspirations they espouse. Leaders are measured by the consistency of their deeds and words—by walking the talk. Leading by example is how leaders make visions and values tangible. It is how they provide the evidence that they are committed and competent.
Leaders enact the meaning of the organization in every decision they make and in every step they take. Leaders understand that they bring shared values to life in a variety of settings—in staff meetings, one-on-one conferences, telephone calls, e-mails, sermons, and in visits with colleagues and constituents.
Show people what’s important by how you spend your time
How you spend your time is the single clearest indicator, especially to other people, about what’s important to you. Critical incidents chance occurrences, particularly at a time of stress and challenge, offer significant moments of learning for leaders. They are often the most dramatic sources of moral lessons about what we should value and how we should behave. They become stories that are passed down in the workplace.
Therefore, you might use an organizer or journal to assess your alignment with your principles. Every evening, ask, “What have I done today to demonstrates that this value is near and dear to me? What have I done inadvertently to demonstrate this is not a value for me? What do I need to do to more fully express my values?”
