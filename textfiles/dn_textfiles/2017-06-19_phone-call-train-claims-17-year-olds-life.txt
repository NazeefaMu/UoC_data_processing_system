Phone call on train claims 17-year-old's life

A youth travelling on the foot board of the Colombo – Talaimannar express train engaged in an animated conversation on his mobile phone on June 17 died on the spot after falling off his perch as the train neared the Ganegoda railway station in Mirigama.
He was identified as H. M. Kasun Lakmal Herath (17) of Konewegama Yahapauwa, a labourer at a construction site at Yakkala. He had boarded the train from the Ragama station enroute to Mahawa from where he had planned to go home on leave.
Although he was seated in the train with two other colleagues he had got up from his seat and gone to the foot board to answer a call on his mobile phone when he met with this tragedy.
Other passengers who saw a man falling from the train had alerted the guard by pulling the emergency chain. The guards had picked the body after halting the train and handed it over to the Mirigama station on the way. On the orders of the Veyangoda inquire into sudden deaths Chandrasiri Marasinghe the body was sent to the Wathupitiwala hospital for a post-mortem examination and report. Pallewela police are investigating.
