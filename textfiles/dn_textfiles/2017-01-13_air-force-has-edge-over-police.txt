Air Force has edge over Police

The high-riding Air Force Sports Club will go out favourites against Police Sports Club in their Dialog ‘A’ Division League return game at Air Force grounds in Ratmalana today commencing 4.00pm.
The Airmen played a superb game against Navy SC last week at Welisara losing after a close fight. Hence they will have to come up with a similar performance if they hope to overcome the Cops with a bonus point victory.

The forte of the Air Force side have been their power-packed forwards and along with their speedy three quarter line they should come up with another blockbuster display with skipper Gayantha Iddamalgoda, Ashok Wijeyjumar, Saraka Weralla, lanky Thilina Bandara, Medagedara brothers, Dimithri Patabandi, Ranindu Padmasanka, Nuwan Perera, Sooriya Krishan along with their ever green centre Charith Seneviratne likely to give of their best.
Meanwhile the unpredictable Police lads who nearly turned tables on CR & FC in the first round game at Longden Place will try their level best to create a shock victory against the formidable Airmen.
