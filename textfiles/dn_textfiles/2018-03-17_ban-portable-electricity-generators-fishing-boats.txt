Ban on portable electricity generators in fishing boats

The Fisheries and Aquatic Resources Development Ministry has decided to impose a ban on carrying portable electricity generators in fishing boats.
The decision was taken after considering the findings of a research conducted by the Ministry, which revealed some negative impacts on certain fishing gear due to the use of electricity generations in non-electric traditional boats, one-day boats, etc. During a meeting held recently at the Fisheries and Aquatic Resources Development Ministry, Minister Mahinda Amaraweera instructed Ministry officials to take necessary measures to add new regulations to the Fisheries and Aquatic Resources Act No. 2 of 1996 in order to ban the use of portable electricity generators on boats for night fishing.
