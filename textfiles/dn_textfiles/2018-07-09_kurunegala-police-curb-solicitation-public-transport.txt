Kurunegala Police to curb solicitation on public transport

Kurunegala Police had made arrangements to curb solicitation on public transport, in both private and Sri Lanka Transport Board (SLTB) buses that ply long-distance journeys through the Kurunegala town.
Commuters had complained that they were inconvenienced due to such salespersons. Some passengers had even fallen off buses and sustained injuries due to such individuals.
“We have planned to stop such activities with immediate effect in order to ensure the safety of passengers,” Kurunegala Assistant Superintendent of Police Mahinda Dissanayake said when he was contacted by the Daily News on Saturday (6).
