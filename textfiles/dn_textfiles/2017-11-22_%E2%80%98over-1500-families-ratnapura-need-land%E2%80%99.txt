‘Over 1,500 families in Ratnapura need land’

“We need to provide alternative land for 1,676 families in Ratnapura and 215 acres were already identified for the purpose. We cannot easily take over land owned by plantation companies. We have to follow a certain procedure. The government will take every step possible to provide relief to the affected people,” Ratnapura District Secretary Malani Lokupothgama said.
She was speaking at an awareness programme conducted at the Ratnapura Weralupa, Diamond Restaurant on Monday (20) for the media on the disaster management mechanism and the need to prepare for challenges posed by climate change.
“Many ask for land in the medium risk areas. We need to make people get used to living with disasters. Otherwise, we will have to evacuate the whole of Ratnapura,” Lokupothagama said.
She said it was necessary to have trained volunteer organisations at the village level to mobilise people at times of disaster to minimise harm.
The damage caused to houses, buildings and roads with the recent floods and landslides cost Rs. 17,200 million to the government. Lokupothgama said Rs. 1,376 million was allocated to rehabilitate 312 roads and to reconstruct 79 schools and the work on them were in progress. She said canals and waterways should not be blocked when constructing houses and the relevant government institutions should not give permission for such construction.
“If everyone fulfilled their responsibilities, we would not have such problems. People implement their plans on holidays thinking that there are no government officers to stop them,” she said.
“Certain people provoked the displaced due to floods and landslides saying that the government was unable to provide them with land. But as government officials, we have certain procedures to follow,” she said.
Ratnapura District Disaster Management Centre Assistant Director Muditha Manjula, District Coordinating Officer Hemantha Abeywardena, National Building and Research Organization Director Abeetha Wanasundara, officials and journalists participated.
