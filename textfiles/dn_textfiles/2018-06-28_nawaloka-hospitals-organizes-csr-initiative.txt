Nawaloka Hospitals organizes CSR initiative

Prioritizing its responsibilities of assisting communities during difficult times, Sri Lanka’s premier private healthcare service provider Nawaloka Hospitals organized a special CSR initiative on June 12, to provide free medicine and medical services, including investigations like blood sugar checkup, for flood victims in the Rathnapura District.
Over 300 participants benefited from this timely CSR initiative which was organized with the help of Rathnapura Divisional Secretariat’s Disaster Management Unit. Free medicine and other medical services were delivered with the help of doctors, nurses and phlebotomists of Nawaloka Hospitals, where a number of local cinema and television stars assisted hospital staff in this endavour.
Commenting about the initiative, Nawaloka Hospitals PLC Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Dr. Jayantha Dharmadasa said, “At Nawaloka Hospitals, we always pledge to help alleviate grief and distress experienced by people during a disastrous period through many initiatives. Helping flood victims in Rathnapura District was part of that initiative. I thank the entire Nawaloka Hospitals’ team who worked tirelessly to make our latest CSR initiative a huge success, where we had the opportunity to provide proper medication and other medical services to people who got heavily affected by the floods.”
Nawaloka entered the state dominated healthcare sector in 1985 and was set up to mirror reputed hospitals in the region which offered advanced medical technology and expert medical care.
