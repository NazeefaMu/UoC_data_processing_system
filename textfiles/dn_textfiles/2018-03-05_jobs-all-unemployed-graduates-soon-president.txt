A batch of 200 graduates and 40 diploma holders received teacher appointment letters at the ceremony. The President presented the appointment letters to 21 graduates and diploma holders to symbolise the event.
President Sirisena who said that the government's attention had been drawn towards implementing certain changes in the education system through new education policies and plans, remarked that graduates who were a valuable asset to the nation had been induced to participate in protest demonstrations due to various shortcomings and drawbacks in the education system.
The President said graduates would be recruited to the teaching profession as well as to fill vacancies in state and local institutions in the Eastern Province on an urgent basis.
The President said he would appoint two separate Presidential Task Forces to reactivate all development activities stalled due to the war situation in the North and East and he desired the active support and cooperation for this endeavour from MPs and ministers representing all political parties.
