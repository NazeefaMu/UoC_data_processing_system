Dragons ignite the screen

A re-imagining of Disney’s cherished family film, ‘ Pete’s Dragon’ is the adventure of an orphaned boy named Pete and his best friend Elliott, who just so happens to be a dragon. ‘Pete’s Dragon’ stars Bryce Dallas Howard (Jurassic World), Oakes Fegley (This is where I leave you) Wes Bentley (The Hunger Games), Karl Urban (Star Trek), Oona Laurence (Southpaw), and Oscar winner Robert Redford (Captain America). For years, old wood carver Mr. Meacham (Robert Redford) has delighted local children with his tales of the fierce dragon that resides deep in the woods of the Pacific Northwest. To his daughter, Grace (Bryce Dallas Howard), who works as a forest ranger, these stories are little more than tall tales… until she meets Pete (Oakes Fegley). Pete is a mysterious 10-year old with no family and no home who claims to live in the woods with a giant, a green dragon named Elliott. From Pete’s descriptions, Elliott seems remarkably similar to the dragon from Mr. Meacham’s stories. Grace sets out to determine where Pete came from, where he belongs and the truth about this dragon.
