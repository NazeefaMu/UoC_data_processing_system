Case against Sarath Kumara Gunaratne to be heard in HC

The magisterial inquiry into former Deputy Minister Sarath Kumara Gunaratne and five others for allegedly misappropriating Rs. 12 million of public funds allocated to the Negombo Lagoon Development Project, was yesterday terminated by the Colombo Chief Magistrate since the Attorney General has already filed indictments against them in the High Court.
When the case came up before Colombo Chief Magistrate Lal Ranasinghe Bandara, the CID informed Court that the Attorney General has filed indictments against the accused in the Colombo High Court and they have been noticed to appear there on April 25. Meanwhile, the Chief Magistrate permitted former Deputy Minister to travel overseas until April 25.
Six accused, including former Fisheries Deputy Minister Sarath Kumara Gunaratne, his son-in-law Upul Chaminda Kumarasinghe and four other officials at the Ceylon Fisheries Harbour Corporation (CFHC) were arrested by the CID for the alleged misappropriation of Rs. 12 million belonging to the CFHC during the last Presidential election.
In this case, the CID had named six individuals, including Gunaratne, as suspects following the instructions of the Attorney General. The Special Presidential Investigation Commission had recommended that the Attorney General’s advice be sought to institute legal action against the persons responsible for the alleged financial fraud.
Senior Counsel Lal Kularatne with Counsel Sampath Mendis appeared for the accused.
