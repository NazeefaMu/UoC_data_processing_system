Eastern farmers prosper

The Agriculture Department will encourage farmers in the Eastern Province to grow fruits and other supplementary crops.
Paddy, maize, banana, mangoes, papaw, green gram, crown nut, kurakkan, cowpea and other supplementary crops will be grown.
Many farmers now grow many of these crops in the Eastern Province and they earn a good income now.
The Agriculture Department supplies the seeds to the farmers at low rates with proper instructions and guidance. They received a bumper maize harvest these days. They sell them along either side of the main road in Ampara.
The farmers, however, claimed that wild elephants destroy their crops and requested authorities to take steps to prevent them from invading their cultivation.
