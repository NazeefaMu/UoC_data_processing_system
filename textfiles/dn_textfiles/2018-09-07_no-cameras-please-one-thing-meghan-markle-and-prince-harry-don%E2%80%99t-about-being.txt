No cameras please! one thing Meghan Markle and Prince Harry don’t like about being royal

MEGHAN MARKLE is adapting to royal life seamlessly, graciously appearing at public events all over the country and impeccably representing the Royal Family. But Meghan just revealed the one thing she doesn’t like about being royal.
Meghan Markle, 37, seems to be perfect for royal life, having her fair share of fame and publicity even before marrying Prince Harry.
She has slotted seamlessly into a life of glamorous events, global travelling, glittering jewellery and one of the most enviable wardrobes in the world.
However, it seems there is one thing that Meghan isn’t quite liking about her new like as the Duchess of Sussex.
At the WellChild awards last night, Meghan let slip that she doesn’t like the cameras being around her. Meghan and Harry spent the night talking to recipients of the awards, including four-year-old Mckenzie Brackley.
The little boy, who won an Inspirational Child award for strength following his battle with acute flaccid paralysis, told the Duke and Duchess that he didn’t like the cameras being around.
Meghan and Harry, who are used to being surrounded by cameras, then told Mckenzie that they completely agreed.
Talking to reporters on the night, Mckenzie’s mother Amy said: "They were so lovely. They knew [Mckenzie] was scared of the cameras and they said they didn’t like the cameras either so they turned around.”
It is known that Meghan and Harry haven’t had the easiest of times when it comes to cameras and publicity. Harry reportedly has tried to scale back public appearances in recent weeks, to try and tone down and control the media frenzy around his wife.
The couple also had issues with the media and cameras at the start of their relationship, so much so that Kensington Palace had to issue a formal statement.
The statement addressed the harassment and abuse that Meghan had faced by certain publications, writing that Harry has "never been comfortable" with the "significant curiosity about his private life”.
The letter, which addressed the “formal action” the Royal Family had had to taken in order to protect their private life and said the media had taken their coverage of Meghan a step too far.
However, it seems the couple do appreciate the power of the media in other ways, with the statement also addressing how the media can raise awareness of "the issues he cares about".
Despite the clicking and flashing cameras at the WellChild event, Meghan still managed to look calm and collected, dressed to the nines in a stylish black power suit.
