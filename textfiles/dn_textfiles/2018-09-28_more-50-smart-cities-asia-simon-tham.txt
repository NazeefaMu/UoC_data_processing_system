More than 50% of smart cities in Asia - Simon Tham

Chief Sales and Marketing Officer- CHEC Port City, Colombo, Simon Tham said that Colombo port city will be developed as a world class city for South Asia and also sought the support of the Sri Lankan government as well as the general public to help realize this vision to create much needed economic benefits in the long run.
“Concept behind this project is to create a city for all and also the project will be executed based on two pillars; livability and sustainability,” he said.
He said the port city land reclamation is scheduled to be completed by mid -2019 and subsequently, they intend to commence work on international financial centre during the same year.
He said so at the 31st annual conference of the Organization of Professional Association of Sri Lanka under the theme, ‘Innovative Digitalization’ held at Cinnamon Grand Hotel, Colombo yesterday.
Making a presentation on ‘towards a digitalized new business era’ at the event, he stressed the need to create more inclusive, integrated and intelligent cities to engage citizens and provide them with better services. He added further that smart cities are anticipated to create huge business opportunities with a market value of over $ 2 trillion by 2025.
Artificial Intelligence (AI), personalized healthcare, robotics, advanced driver assistance systems, distributed energy generation and other technologies will drive smart cities of the future.
In addition, the Asia Pacific region is anticipated to be the fastest growing region in the smart energy space by 2025. More than 50% of smart cities will be in Asia.
Meanwhile Jiffry Zulfer, Chief Executive Officer of PickMe speaking at the event said emerging technologies today are likely to reshape all steps of business activities and the government as well as policymakers need to understand this situation and take immediate actions to develop both ICT sector and start up culture in Sri Lanka.
“Today computers are impacting our day to day lives in a bigger way and will continually disrupt every industry you can think of. And many jobs that we have today will not exist in another 10 years time and we need to be aware of what’s coming in the future,” he said. He said Sri Lanka needs to recognize these emerging trends and take necessary steps to stay relevant in the market place. According to him, the world’s most valuable resource is no longer oil, but technology and data.
