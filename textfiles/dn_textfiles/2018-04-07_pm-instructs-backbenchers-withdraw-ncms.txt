PM INSTRUCTS BACKBENCHERS TO WITHDRAW NCMs

Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe has stated that the No-confidence motions handed over by the backbencher UNP MPs was not a decision of the UNP but are the views of a few MPs.
Accordingly the Prime Minister, in his capacity as the leader of the UNP, while noting that any decision regarding a No-Confidence motion must be taken at a UNP parliamentary group meeting, has instructed the UNP backbencher parliamentarians to withdraw the No-Confidence motions.
Further decisions on the matter will be taken at a UNP group meeting, soon.
He has asserted that the issues arisen with SLFP would be resolved through negotiations, a press release of the Government Information Department said yesterday.
