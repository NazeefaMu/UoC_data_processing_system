EDEX, Chairman Mahinda Galagedara highlighted that EDEX has been regarded as the country's one and only educational and career guidance programme, conducting continuously for a long period of 15 years. He said EDEX has come a long way since the inaugural exhibition launched in 2004 as a multi-stakeholder social enterprise initiative.
He also said the 15th anniversary in 2018 will be a momentous occasion .
Galagedara said most of the present day urban students and parents are better aware of choices, options and opportunities in post-secondary education which is leading to gainful employment.
Chairman Galagedara also mentioned that students who are pursuing higher education will get credit facilities on concessionary terms and said both state owned and many private sector banks including the EDEX official banker National Development Bank have introduced long term educational loan facilities for students
“It is also happy to see most universities and Educational Institutes offer full and partial scholarships to youth engaged in higher studies, he said.
