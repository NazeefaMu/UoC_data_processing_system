'I have nothing to do with the Rajapaksas''

President Maithripala Sirisena has informed the UNP back benchers that he had nothing to do with the Rajapaksas and that he would not have any form of transaction with them, Health Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne said.
According to Minister Dr. Senaratne, President Sirisena had told them to inquire about some UNP MPs who have had connections with the Rajapaksas. The minister expressed those views during a ceremony held at his political office in Kalutara to commence work for 2017.
Minister Dr. Senaratne also stated that no one would be able to topple this Government. The year 2017 would be a victorious year for the Government and all investigations into acts of corruption, malpractices and murder, would be completed and stern legal action would be taken against all culprits.
There are racists in all ethnicities and they destroy the country. There are some intellectuals who do not think about the country. Some lawyers formulate bills without a proper knowledge of the law of the land. Devolution of power takes place throughout the world. The Mattala Airport and Hambantota Harbour areas would be developed with the assistance of China and it would provide employment opportunities for millions of Sri Lankan youth, he said.
Employments would alleviate poverty in districts such as Hambantota and Moneragala. The former President only opened projects under his name to celebrate his birthdays, but he was not concerned about their existence in the long run, he added.
