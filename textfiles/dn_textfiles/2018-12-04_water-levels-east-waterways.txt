Water levels up in East waterways

Water levels of tanks, rivers and wells in the Eastern Province have increased due to the North East monsoon rains. Therefore, officials advise villagers to be vigilant.
Tourists are prohibited to bathe at dangerous waterways. Sea bath should also be curtailed due to strong currents. A few deaths were reported due to bathing in unsafe places. Parents have been asked to take care when children bathe in unsafe places.
The crocodile population had risen in some catchment areas. The Irrigation Department has put up noticeboards in places where crocodiles are found.
