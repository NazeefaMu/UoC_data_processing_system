Parliamentary select committee for Rathupaswela shooting

 
President Sirisena, in Parliament today, said a parliamentary select committee should be appointed to look into the Rathupaswela shooting.
Three people were killed and dozens injured when the military clashed with residents demanding clean water in 2006, during the former regime.
