Hope for Tomorrow- 2015

The Rotaract Club of American National College together with the Interact Club of D S Senanayake College organized the project 'Hope for Tomorrow 2015' on November 1, where they took measures to donate essential items to the 'All Island Buddhist Association Jayanthi Male Kids Developing Center'.
The child care centre Jayanthi is situated in the village of Pambe close to Kalutara, which consists of 11 orphaned boys. This is one of the 17 Child Care centers owned by All Ceylon Buddhist Congress and they are situated all over the country. Comparatively this orphanage is one of the poorest which goes through a lot of circumstances due to poverty.
"These children are truly desperate in every way as they are not able to fulfill their needs and desires as they wish. In such an instance, a group of children from the Rotaract Club of American National College and the Interact Club of D S Senanayake College stepped forward to ponder over this miserable situation and made themselves achieve one biggest blessing by offering a fund to this particular child care center.
It was truly amazing to experience the moment that the youngsters who are able to fulfill most of their needs took a chance to understand and provide these innocent children. I truly believe that these deeds will help you all to benefit yourselves and lead you all to a successful future. May you all have a bright future", Secretary of the National Council for Child Welfare K W Sandya Gunathilaka stated.
The parent club of the Rotaract Club of American National College, that is the Rotary Club of Colombo West has been their standing pillars of strength having had contributed a significant amount of donations to make this project a success.
