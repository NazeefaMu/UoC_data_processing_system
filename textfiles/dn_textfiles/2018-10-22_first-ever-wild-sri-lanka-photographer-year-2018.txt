The first ever WILD SRI LANKA Photographer of the year 2018

Wild Sri Lanka organizes the first ever “WILD SRI LANKA Photographer of the year 2018”
Wildlife photography is a significant part of photography, and living in an island with a rich and diverse wildlife gives us the privilege of enjoying and experiencing wildlife photography at its best. The team Wild Sri Lanka is on a unique endeavor to muse the art of wildlife photography with the very important cause of conserving the wildlife through a photographic exhibition: “Wild Sri Lanka Photographer of the year 2018”. The exhibition will be held at Temple Trees in Colombo.
Living in an age where wildlife conservation is crucial for the world, the exhibition “Wild Sri Lanka Photographer of the year 2018” intends to explore the beauty and the value imprinted on wildlife through the age old yet ever transforming medium of photography. The main goal of this Exhibition is to bring together photographers or wild life enthusiasts, who possess a keen passion towards Wildlife photography and provide them an apt platform to display their skills and abilities, in order to create a wildlife conservation social movement, it deserves.
Lakshitha Karunarathna, Organizing Committee Member of Wild Sri Lanka commented on the event, “Through Wild Sri Lanka, we hope to create awareness and inspire the general public about the magnificent fauna and flora of this country, so they yield sincere initiatives to conservation of Sri Lankan wildlife. On one hand we believe that this initiative will create a platform for all the wildlife and nature lovers, conservationists, and researchers to share knowledge and inspire many to follow their paths and protect the world.
And on the other hand we believe the exhibition will allow the photographers in Sri Lanka to expose themselves into a competition of international standards to share each other’s knowledge and interests to improve their skills and knowledge”.
The event is organized by Wild Sri Lanka; a movement managed by the Team Wild Unlimited in dedication for all who loves and respects the Nature and Wild Life photography.
The exhibition is partnered with CameraLK as the Platinum partner, PR Wire as the PR partner and Lakseyaas the print partner.
The entries will be inspected by an experienced panel of national and international judges including some experts in the field, which will allow the Sri Lankan photographers to reach out for the recognition from international competitions.
The event which is due to be held on November 24-25 will include several exciting features including open workshops based on wildlife photography and conservation for all the winners.
This work shop will be conducted by award winning wildlife photographer Lakshitha Karunarathna.
In addition, all the participants would receive Valuable certificates and gifts will include prize money worth LKR 200,000/=, 100,000/= and 50,000/= for the 1st , 2nd and 3rd winners.
