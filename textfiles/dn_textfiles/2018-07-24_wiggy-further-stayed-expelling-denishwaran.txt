Wiggy further stayed from expelling Denishwaran

The Court of Appeal yesterday further extended its Interim Order till August 9, preventing the decision of Northern Province Chief Minister C.V. Wigneswaran to expel B. Denishwaran from functioning as the Minister of Fisheries and Transport in the province. The Court of Appeal Bench comprised Justice Kumuduni Wickremesinghe and Justice Janak de Silva.
The petitioner B. Denishwaran had challenged Northern Province Chief Minister C. V. Wigneswaran in the Court of Appeal, complaining that the Chief Minister has no power to appoint or remove any provincial council minister. The petitioner cited Chief Minister Wigneswaran, K. Sarveswaran, Ananthi Sasitharan, G. Gunaseelan, K.Sivanesan and P. Sathiyalingam as well as Governor Reginald Cooray as respondents. Chief Minister C. V. Wigneswaran was given further time to file objections against the Interim Order.
The petitioner claims he was one of the members of the Northern Province Board of Ministers. He states that in October 2016, a dispute arose with respect to the conduct of ministers, following which the Chief Minister appointed an inquiry panel.
Counsel Suren Fernando appeared for the petitioner.
