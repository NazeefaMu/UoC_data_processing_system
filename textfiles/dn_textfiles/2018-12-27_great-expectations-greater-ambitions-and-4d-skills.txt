Great expectations, greater ambitions and 4D skills

Blessings to one and all this special season for giving... especially those who believe in and live by our Union code.
ItÌs a marvel in itself and truly the phenomenon of Christmas that binds the world.
All clubs take a good break ...for itís time for rehab and contemplating.
Coaches can afford some grey matter indulgence.... possibly even some lateral fixing..?
Good time for options and understanding real pressure.
Sean Wijeysinghe is away and Fazil back under the kosh despite their 30 game winning streak.
Remarkable phenomenon this ..hard to beat ..let alone match.
Martis and Lakala need some specifics in place to stamp their brand of rugby.
CR and Nilufers have had some horrible luck... which is tough to counter in the middle...round 2 should free their running game and plenty for Tarinda Ratwatte to glide through... almost the Midas touch this year...... much to the dismay of opposition plans to nail him.
Nawaz and Rodda really shaping the police boys for some inspired rugby next year. They have a decent balance and potential to upset form.
What Navy coach Motilal could not do.....was beat defending champions Kandy...despite leading to the wire.
Just good instincts lacking. Thatís the magic champions carry.
Even on a mundane home grubby days....they finish better.
Tough pill to neck it down and Havelocks running out of petrol...and patience.
Ronny is best under pressure and lateral ability his fall back.
CH certainly the glam team by fault on paper.
Results quiz that fact...names got little to offer...unless team÷the sprint so much a vital stretch to counter thinking.
CH has been my island home...and a family drama that is still beyond convention.
If they find their stripes and finishing, the league is open ...and between challenges÷ so needed to spice up and encourage waffles of fresh tropical island rugby.
Their passion will now be tested. Their passion exploring the ocean of options... Big wins with domestic weekends beyond seal and cement Kandy ...as the top.
The change is harsh and massive ....some therapy to survive the super league format will separate contenders...in the 2 games they play in 2019.
Equally horrified by news of the national U19 skipper compromising everything.
His behaviour needs careful scrutiny and practical steps to educate and penance.....he must be singled out for discipline and punishment.
The union is fundamental, decide quickly and eradicate the source.
Apart from losing ...we have horrid humiliation of looking unprofessional as a stakeholder of Asian rugby.
I hope action is swift and surgical.
The fear of not setting a proper example on and off the field ...absolutely fundamental to all our futures.
That the game is in need of solid protection ...so that players, fans and administration can execute their tasks, devoid of fear and recriminations.
Sri Lanka rugby have huge responsibility to stamp out unacceptable behaviour at all levels.
The future must shine, shine, shine.
Blessings to all rugby hearts once again and strength to our guiding executive of officials to ensure fair play and natural justice at all times.
That is the axis on which we rotate and planet rugby demands nothing short of maximum
Enjoy the holidays ...absorb some international rugby, catch up with Setanta replays at leisure.
Love it ... live it ... be 1 with the game.
Bula bula Sri Island life!
