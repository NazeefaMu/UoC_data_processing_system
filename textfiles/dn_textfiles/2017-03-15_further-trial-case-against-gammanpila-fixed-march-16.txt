Further trial into case against Gammanpila fixed for March 16

Australian businessman Brian Shaddick, 74, a key witness in the alleged financial fraud case filed against Pivithuru Hela Urumaya (PHU) leader MP Udaya Gammanpila, yesterday denied the claims and suggestions made by defence that he was giving false evidence in Court.
Australian businessman Brian Shaddick and his wife were yesterday present before Colombo High Court Judge R. Gurusinghe, in connection with an indictment filed against MP Udaya Gammanpila for allegedly misappropriating Rs. 20 million, following his alleged fraudulent share transaction that had taken place in 2000.
On one occasion, the witness accepted a suggestion made by defence counsel Savindra Fernando PC that he never came to Sri Lanka between 1992 and 2015 in fear of his life, following information he received from Gammanpila that the son of Sydney Jayasinghe was conspiring to kill him. However, the defence tabled in Court a document to prove the fact that Australian businessman Shaddick had come to Sri Lanka in 1996 to sign as an attesting witness of the wedding of Muditha Jayasinghe, a son of Sydney Jayasinghe.
Witness Shaddick further said yesterday that he never had signed a document executing a Power-of-Attorney to Udaya Gammanpila. Meanwhile, the defence counsel Jayantha Weerasing PC informed Court that his client Gammanpila was not having in his possession the original Power-of-Attorney in question. Further trial was fixed for March 16.
The Attorney General (AG) alleged that MP Udaya Gammanpila has misappropriated Rs. 20 million when selling shares of Digital Nominees to businessman Dhammika Perera. The AG further charged that the alleged business transaction had taken place using a fraudulent Power-of-Attorney to sell the shares belonging to Australian businessman Brian Shaddick.
The AG has listed 20 persons as witnesses in the case and named 16 documents as production items of the case. MP Gammanpila was arrested in this regard on June 18, 2016. He is currently out on bail. Deputy Solicitor General Dilan Ratnayake, with Senior State Counsel Nayana Seneviratne appeared for the Attorney General. President’s Counsel Shavindra Fernando with Jayantha Weerasinghe PC and Senior Counsel Nalinda Indatissa appeared for MP Gammanpila.
