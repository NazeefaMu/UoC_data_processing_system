Govt. turning into military regime: Amarasekara

The government is turning into a fascist military regime. It manoeuvres the Inspector General of Police and the Attorney General by mis-employing them for its own advantage, Jathika Sanvidana Ekamuthuwa Convener, Gunadasa Amarasekara said.
He said so speaking on the arrest of former Minister Wimal Weerawansa. Amarasekara said that it was a fruitless attempt by the government to silence a leading figure against the new federal Constitution.
“If we are to take former President Chandrika Bandaranaike’s remarks on hate-speech into consideration, the government may arrest us as well,” Amarasekara pointed out.
Amarasekara also condemned Ven. Athuraeliye Rathana Thera’s decision to stay independent and attempt to correct the Yahapalana government on certain decisions. Rathana thero’s attempt is to weaken the nationalistic movement against the government by producing a movement of their own, Amarasekara said.
“Ven. Rathana thera is also behind a master plan to bring Patali Champika Ranawaka into power,” Amarasekara alleged.
He also said that the UNP and the SLFP in the joint government are like two thieves who act as enemies by day and go around stealing by night.
“The government is not interested in abolishing the executive presidency, changing the electoral system or solving ethnic issue,” he further said.
Attorney-at-Law, Kalyananda Thiranagamage said the government is meddling with the judiciary of the country.
“The cases filed by the FCID are not legal. Implementing national policies for the right or wrong, cannot be considered a crime, it can only be an irregularity. It is the responsibility of the Auditor General to look into irregularities connected with national policy implementations,” Thiranagamage said.
“Every individual has the freedom of expression. So how does a court issue an order prohibiting demonstrations for 14 days?” Thiranagamage questioned. Speaking on regaining the GSP+ facility, Dr. Wasantha Bandara said it is but a trap to fall prey.
