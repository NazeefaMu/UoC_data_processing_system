CFASL holds charter award ceremony

The CFA Society of Sri Lanka (CFASL) recognised 40 individuals, the highest number to date, who successfully completed the CFA program at its 2017 Charter Award Ceremony and Annual Oration held at HNB Towers.
Director and Chief Executive Office of Nations Trust Bank, Renuka Fernando was the Chief Guest and Orator at the event.
CFASL President Rachini Rajapaksa, while congratulating the new batch of charter holders and Level III passed finalists, urged them to measure up and reiterated that the duty of all society member is to live up to the CFA Institute’s mission “to lead the investment profession globally by promoting the highest standards of ethics, education, and professional excellence for the ultimate benefit of society.”
Rachini stressed on the importance of professional excellence and ethics in the light of the ongoing investigation of financial scandals, and that it is one's own actions that will shape or destroy not only one's destiny but also the integrity of the Finance profession and the CFA designation.
Rachini advised the new batch of charterholders and passed finalists to develop a strong character that the others can be proud of and not be swayed by inappropriate influences.
The CFA Institute has processes such as an easy to use whistle blowing process coupled with a strict disciplinary process to investigate and take action against members who are found to have violated the principles of ethics and integrity. Rachini called upon all charterholders to make use of the tools provided by CFA Institute in order to report any violations and incidents.
Renuka Fernando in delivering her oration spoke on the topic of “Women in Investment Management” which is one of the themes currently promoted by CFA Institute. She emphasized the importance of this topic given the shortage of quality people in the financial sector and hence the need of the day is to mobilize the entire talent pool in order to meet this challenge. She underlined the seriousness of the problem by quoting a recent news article where the average board representation of the top 30 listed corporates in Sri Lanka is at a mere 10.5%.
Speaking based on her own experience in the banking sector, she identified two main reasons for this situation to arise. The first is due to a lack of confidence where this issue has been exacerbated given Sri Lanka’s education system which is not conducive for confidence building.
These sentiments which have been cultivated at a younger age is carried over to the workplace which stymie’s one’s ability to advance up the corporate ladder. Given this she stated that one must make a conscious effort to overcome these mental barriers when entering the workforce.
The second reason she highlighted was the difficulties faced by professional women to balance their roles at home and in the office. She advised those who are just starting on their professional careers to come to the realization that “you simply cannot be super mum and super career woman at the same time, every day, 24 hours of the day”. While there were no easy solutions to this, she nevertheless stressed that it is doable if you are determined and not afraid to step up to a challenge.
