Cancer unit at Ambalantota hospital a boon

The cancer unit at the Ambalantota base hospital has become a boon to cancer patients in the Hambantota District. Prior to setting up of the cancer unit at this hospital, cancer patients had to be admitted to the cancer hospital in Karapitiya, Galle, which is about 50 kilometres away from Hambantota District. It is the only cancer hospital in the South.
Dr. Danushka Perera said the cancer unit at Ambalantota hospital was opened in December 2017 and patients began to be admitted in January. He said that in 2015 there were cancer clinics at the general hospital in Hambantota.There was an oncologist but he was given facilities only for a clinic.
Dr. Perera said this cancer unit was set up on the instructions of Director General Health Services, Dr Anil Jasinha. The unit started with eight beds but now has 16 beds. From January, 42 patients have already been treated here. This unit at the Ambalantota base hospital is being managed by the Hambantota general hospital.
