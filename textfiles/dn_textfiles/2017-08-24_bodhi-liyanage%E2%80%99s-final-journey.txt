Many mourners lined the cemetery with his wife, two daughters, two granddaughters, two sons- in-law and other family members who joined in his last journey. It is customary for Bodhi to visit his home in Kandy once a month and do some cleaning. It was while coming down the stairway that he is said to have suffered the accident when he tripped and knocked his head. The cause of his death was due to brain stem.
There were emotional scenes on the streets as the sports promoter’s coffin was brought after 4.00 p.m. with full Police honors. The funeral was given a police escort, where top police officers like IGP Pujith Jayasundara, Senior DIG M.R Latheef, STF Commandant and many top police officers both present and past were present at his last journey.

At the time of his death, he was a retired senior Deputy Inspector General of Police, who was dedicated to all Sri Lankans. He started his police career as an ASP and ended up as a senior DIG and the first STF big boss.
When Bodhi became the president of Kandy Association Football League he had a very clear mission. He wanted Kandy football to hit the top. It was under his presidency for the first time Kandy Association Football League won the Inter league tournament in 1992, and when Kandy won he was in the UK on a mission. The winning team was given a chance to tour Nepal for a tournament that was the first time a Kandy team flew overseas for football.
