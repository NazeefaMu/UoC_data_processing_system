Ambalantota town development plans still a dream

There were mighty plans by the previous regime to develop the town of Ambalantota town under a plan mooted by the UDA, but even foundation stones were not laid for the development.
As such, the development plan still remains at the planning stage, the citizens of Ambalantota said. Under the development plan, the following projects were to be implemented which included setting up of a bus stand, a play ground, renovation of Ridiyagama Wadurupa road and Beragama road, the renovation of the circular road in close proximity to the clock tower in the heart of the town.
The roads in the heart of the town are narrow and as such the vehicular traffic is greatly obstructed. The Ambalantota is a main commercial city but the town remains congested.
