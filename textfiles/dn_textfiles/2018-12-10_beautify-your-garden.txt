Beautify  your  garden

If you want to stamp your signature on your garden there is no better way than designing soft landscaping features. Today, continuing from last week’s article on Soft Landscaping features we touch on landscaping features like Hedges, Lawns and Vines and Creepers. Green Thumbs speaks to Deputy Provincial Director of Agriculture Office Ratmalana, District Agriculture Instructor K. N. K. Jayathilake on these features that really bring out ones individuality.
Hedges 
Hedges are actually a collection of plants diverse in colors creating a contrast in the garden. Hedges serve as organic walls, living and natural walls. Seeing a plant can subconsciously make you feel calm and relaxed and plants can remove the carbon dioxide in the air. Plants with flowers have an immediate impact upon ones overall feeling of wellbeing. There is sufficient evidence to point out that, plants have therapeutic benefits and that plants contribute to good health. So when growing hedges you are able to create your kind of environment and an atmosphere that is very positive. Rather than creating cement walls that separates your garden from the neighbors, living walls are more friendly, and create the ‘good neighbour feeling’, but at the same time maintain that ‘firmness’ that will deter intruders.
“Soft Landscaping features like hedges enable one to bring out ones individuality. It also gives one protection, as it acts as living walls and the placement of hedges allows you greater control in your garden. By dividing your plot of land into different sections while concealing undesirable features you are protected from intense sunlight and animals threats. It also brings out that all important naturalness in the garden as cement walls can be stifling,” said Jayathilake.

Different shapes of hedges contribute to the beauty in a garden. Examples for hedges are Croton, Acalypha and bamboos. However, maintaining these hedges require a lot of time and energy. They need to be pruned and cared for properly. Otherwise if they are allowed to grow without pruning then your garden will not look very nice. There is evidence to point out that the practice of growing hedges dates back to the Neolithic Age (4000–6000 years ago), where they were used to enclose land for crops.
Borders 
“Another feature of Soft Landscaping is borders. They are used to define what is within the garden while hedges are around the garden. Borders are used to create that sense of discipline in the garden while protecting garden features. If you take the lawns, borders create barriers within the lawns and also are grown around flower beds, bushes, ponds and shrubs. It is also used on either side of pathways. Borders vary in size and place. Borders on either side of the pathways are usually 1 – 1 ½ feet in size. If the pathways and hedges are big then the borders should be around 2 ½ - 3 feet. Around flower beds they should be around 6 – 8 inches,” explained Jayathilake.
Flower beds (sub head) 
Flower beds are indispensable to a garden. Blooming flowers are like the rainbow and are wonderful to look at. Flower beds of different shapes create an effect backed up by stunning colors. For this you need to remember that annual flower plants must be used. Otherwise it will be harrowing growing and replanting all the time. Flower beds can be created on either side of the pathways making your garden, like a garden in a fairytale. The sizes of the flower beds need to be structured according to the size of the pathways. If the pathway is small, the flower beds need to be small in size and short in height. According to your sense of individuality you can decide whether the flowers need to be of the same color or different colors. Small flower beds can be used around the lawns. They can even be placed in the center of the lawn.
Lawns
“Lawns are another feature of soft landscaping that covers a large percentage of the garden. It is pleasing to the eye and gives an effect of coolness. It gives you a feeling of rest and relaxation. It also gives you mental satisfaction when you look at a beautiful lawn. It is a play area for children, decreasing soil erosion and contributes to greenery. Types of lawns are luxurious lawns and normal lawns. Luxurious lawns are for special purposes. Normal lawns are for normal needs,” stated Jayathilake.
Now a good example for luxurious lawns is the White House Lawn. It is created to give that sense of power. That sense of imperiousness. Some of the trees on the South Lawn include the earliest remaining trees on the grounds planted by United States President Andrew Jackson. Types of lawns are Bord Leaf Carpet Grass, Bermuda Grass and Narrow Leaf Carpet Grass.
“In maintaining lawns there need to be some essential conditions. There has to be good drainage, and the ground needs to be level ground and the grass needs to be cut regularly,” added Jayathilake.
Vines and Creepers 
Vines and Creepers are features that really beautifies the garden. They are used for Arches and Pergolas. This garden feature adds charm to any garden. Garden arches are ideal for marking the entrance to a path or area of your garden, or as a beautiful support for your climbing plants. When the vines are flowering vines the effect is very beautiful. One example is when the vines hang down like a curtain. When choosing vines you need to select the right color which could be a combination of different flowering vines or vines of one color. Some good examples are Thunbergia Alata, Garlic Vine and White Jasmine.
