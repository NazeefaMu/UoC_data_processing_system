JO cannot challenge government - Ruwan

 
The Joint Opposition cannot pose any challenge to the government which comprises the country’s two main political parties while holding Paada Yathra, Defence State Minister Ruwan Wijewardene said.
“Misdeeds by the previous regime cannot be pardoned. We remember the way they acted in Rathupaswela and Katunayake incidents and the way they behaved when we protested. They arrested General Sarath Fonseka in 2010. How can they solve public issues through a Paada Yathra which they used for entertainment and making criticism against the government,” the State Minister questioned. “They set up a shadow cabinet. We saw the way its foreign minister acted in the Paada Yathra which was said to address the common issues of the public.
The only thing they have pointed out throughout their march is the necessity of a family rule.
A group comprising bankrupt politicians is trying to break up the Sri Lanka Freedom Party into two groups. They are using Mahinda Rajapaksa as a tool to fulfill their needs, he said.
“A government is usually opposed by holding protests during the final phase of its ruling period. But the Joint Opposition has began to show their opposition towards the Yaha Palana government just after a year. We can correct our mistakes and go forward if they point out our failures in a correct manner,” Wijewardene said.
