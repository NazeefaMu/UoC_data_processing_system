AIA commemorates World Environment Day

AIA employees joined hands with ReForest Sri Lanka and the Road Development Authority (RDA) Sri Lanka, in an initiative to expand forest coverage in Sri Lanka.
Volunteers from AIA Head Office and branch offices planted 500 saplings along the Southern expressway in Gelanigama, in an endeavour to make Sri Lanka greener.
This was part of AIA’s ‘Go Green 2018’ efforts and was done in commemoration of World Environment Day, which falls in June.
