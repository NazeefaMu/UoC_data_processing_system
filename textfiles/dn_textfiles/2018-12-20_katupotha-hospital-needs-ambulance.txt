Katupotha Hospital needs ambulance

Residential patients of the Katupotha Government Hospital in the Kurunegala district are facing difficulties as the hospital has no proper ambulance service to be used during an emergency.
‘There is an ambulance at the hospital which is out of commission, Hospital Development Committee President Sarath S. Rathnayake, told the Daily News, yesterday. Accordingly, a number of appeals had been submitted to higher authorities of the North Western Province Health Ministry requesting a new ambulance, but, we had not received any positive response for past two years, he added.
