Corruption: over 180 complaints

The Voice Against Corruption Organisation yesterday requested a Central Bank and Inland Revenue Department to intervene the implementation of the law with regard to moneys illegally repatriated abroad as disclosed by the Panama papers and US-based Global Financial Integrity organisation.
Convener of Voice Against Corruption Wasantha Samarasinghe addressing a media briefing yesterday said the ‘Panama Papers’ exposure may help divulge important information regarding local politicians and their friends and relatives whose accounts were circulated through several banks in other countries.
"Special investigation should be conducted to take legal action against Sri Lankans who figure in the ‘Panama papers'', he said.
He said that the Maithripala-Ranil government has failed the people, just like the previous government.
"At the time of the election, President Sirisena made many promises to the people, but today he is silent. When this government came into power they promised to investigate and bring those guilty to book. However, what is now happening is that President Sirisena is looking the other way and minding his own business and Ranil Wickremesinghe is also doing the same," he said.
"It is very evident that this government too is protecting the fraudsters and culprits and has only cheated the people in order to come into power.
We have also discovered that this government is protecting the deal makers and now they are also in the government.
The UNP is also now working towards releasing political figures by sacrificing some lower ranking officers in order to hoodwink the people," he said.
"We ask that President Sirisena keep his promise to the people and punish the wrong doers. If not this government cannot go forward. In order to protect the party, thePresident has even added wrong doers to his
party. Prime Minister Wickremesinghe too add people those who are responsible for the bribery and corruption to the government," he said.
"We have already lodged 180 detailed complaints to the FCID, CID and the Anti-Corruption Secretariat with regard to the large corruption and malpractices of the previous government. But the actions are pending. If they are not going to enforce the law of the country and take action, they there is no doubt that this government too is acting against the law. We will not let off and we will continue to fight to expose the wrong doers of this country and push for justice," he said.
"This government also engaged in nepotism like the previous government," he also alleged. "One example is the payment of Rs. 700,000 as rent for the official residence of SLT and Mobitel Chairman who is the brother of President. His own allowance has also been raised from Rs.500, 000 to Rs.1million. A sonin-law of one of the powerful ruling party politicians has an Advertising Agency which handles all government related advertisement jobs. There have been many corrupt deals at the Lanka Transforms Limited which are not second to the transactions done by the Avant-Garde. Most of the people at the Lanka Transforms Limited are past employees of the CEB. People who have benefited from this are blocking the COPE investigations now. We have a doubt whether FCID is also have a connection to this as the FCID officials are dragging the investigations for long time," he said.
