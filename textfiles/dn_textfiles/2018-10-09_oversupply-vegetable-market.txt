Oversupply in the vegetable market

Vegetables and fruits were reported to be in oversupply at the Dambulla Market. Farmers who brought their produce from long distances failed to find buyers. It was said that 50 tonnes of the produce were thrown to elephants and other animals for their consumption (A modest compensation for encroaching upon their habitat!).
This is not the first time it happened. Some time ago there was an excessive supply of pumpkins. An irregularly recurring incidence has been the mismatch between demand and supply reaching extremes. Producers fail to recover the cost of production and fall into debt.
Pauperization of the poor peasant continues quicker.
Lack of planning
Why did it happen? Was it inevitable and unavoidable? Lack of planning is the principal reason. Discarding planning as a “socialistic” practice and dismantling the excellent planning apparatus that existed, we have laid the ground for such oversupply.
In the absence of reliable and timely information the peasant is guided by his personal experience to plan his future crop. For example, if he finds that others who have planted a crop X have made better profits this season he is also tempted to switch over to the production of that crop instead of what he had done earlier. If considerable producers act like him it could produce an oversupply of X.
Introduction of superior seeds and new varieties also could cause an excess. The case for an islandwide agricultural extension service cannot be therefore overestimated. Such a service could have provided timely and correct information about optimum numbers of acres under different crops that could be grown. It is unpardonable to allow a situation to develop where the producers are denied the opportunity to obtain such information in time.
Let us look at this phenomenon further and try to find out the strengths and weaknesses of our agriculture that lie hidden beneath such phenomena. Naturally climatic conditions have been conducive for the surplus crop. But it was achieved with the same old technology. If new technology is introduced it would make the surplus still more.
The surplus product could be either exported or kept in cold storage to be released to the market when prices escalate. This brings to the fore the question of building large cold storage plants in agricultural districts. Sri Lanka is behind other developing countries in agricultural product preservation. It is necessary to embrace high technology driven food preservation methods besides developing native traditional methods.
Land fragmentation
From the foregoing it is apparent that Sri Lanka has a positive potential for food security, if necessary managerial and policy decisions are taken in time. Two factors are important here.
One is the need for a modern communication set up linking the markets and producers. Other is to maintain rational proportions between subsistence agriculture and commercial agriculture, our food security. While the latter is more profitable the former is the backbone of our food security.
There have been attempts to persuade farmers to abandon subsistence agriculture and engage in commercial agriculture by interested parties including the World Bank. Such an action would endanger the food security of the people.
Problems of subsistence agriculture such as land tenure, the fragmentation of land, the huge debt burden of the peasantry, low productivity of land and oflabour, huge cost of inputs including fertilizer, shortage of labour and poor water management need to be resolved urgently.
Unlike in industry, agriculture, especially the production of fruits and vegetables has the potential of mobilizing the masses. Home gardening, including urban home gardening could assist the food production drive in a big way. This has not been pursued with interest.
Sri Lanka’s agricultural research is minimal. Even the once thriving plantation agriculture research institutes lack staff and facilities. In view of climate change and regularly occurring or alternating floods and droughts we need to find new varieties of rice that could withstand flood waters or that need minimal water such as drip irrigation. Even such simple solutions as rainwater harvesting are not practiced on a scale.
Even in commercial agriculture our performance is not healthy. Tea, rubber and coconut industries are in a state of neglect. Obsolete technology and lack of value addition plague them.
