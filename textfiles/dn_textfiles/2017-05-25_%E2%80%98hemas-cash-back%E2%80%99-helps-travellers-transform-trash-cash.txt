‘Hemas Cash Back’ helps travellers transform trash into cash

Hemas Travels, the local representative for Hogg Robinson Group (HRG), the global travel management company with representation in over 120 countries, has been appointed the official representative for the Cash Back, the VAT reclaim organisation with its Head Office in Switzerland. 
“Hemas is delighted to have been given the rights to market and sell the Cash Back VAT reclaim services in the local market in order to significantly reduce our clients travel costs”, said Amila Gunawardana, Manager in Charge of Hemas Cash Back.
Each year, businesses in the region spend millions in VAT on services supplied in UK, Europe, Canada and Australia. It includes VAT charged on hotel accommodation, entertainment, telephone calls, travel, transportation, training, conferences, meetings and events, exhibitions, as well as other services. Recovering VAT on these types of services represents a significant cost saving when it is refunded to companies by Hemas Cash Back.
With the Hemas Cash Back tie-up, corporate organisations based in Sri Lanka can reclaim what is rightfully theirs in terms of VAT refunds for all travel and related costs incurred during business trips made in the above markets.
“Cash Back is proud to be associated with Hemas, one of Sri Lanka’s largest award winning, IATA accredited travel agencies”, said Jane Holmberg, Head of United Cash Back Operations.
“As HRG’s representative in Sri Lanka, Hemas Travels has always set the local benchmark for corporate travellers to experience the best of what any global business travel agent has to offer. This partnership is further testimony to this as HRG Sri Lanka adds to the list of reasons why they should be the corporate travel agent of choice in Sri Lanka”, said Fahim Jalali, Regional Head for HRG and Cash Back across Middle East, West Asia and North Africa.
The process is simple, Hemas Cash Back simply registers each client and collects their original invoices for submission to the relevant tax authorities, providing regular updates on the status of each claim, all working to ensure that maximum refunds are reclaimed for the client’s business.
