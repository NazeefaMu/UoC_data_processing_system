Depression likely in next 48 hours

The low pressure area in the South Bay of Bengal to the southeast of Sri Lanka is likely to develop into a depression during the next 48 hours and to move north–northwestwards, towards the Tamil Nadu coast.
There is high possibility of heavy rainfall and sudden roughness associated with the sudden increase of wind speed (up to 70–80 kmph) in the deep sea areas off the coast, extending from Hambantota to Trincomalee via Batticaloa and Pottuvil.
The Naval and fishing communities are requested to be attentive about advisories issued by the Meteorology Department in this regard.
Wind speed will be 50–60 kmph over the sea areas and the wind speed can increase up to 70–80 kmph at times.
The sea areas can be rough to very rough at times.
Rough seas can be expected during thundershowers too.
