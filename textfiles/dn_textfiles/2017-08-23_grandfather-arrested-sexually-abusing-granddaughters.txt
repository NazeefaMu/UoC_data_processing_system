Grandfather arrested for sexually abusing granddaughters

 
The Anuradhapura Women and Children’s Bureau arrested a sixty-one-year-old man last evening for sexually abusing his two granddaughters.
The children - aged fourteen and seven – were abused several times when they were left under his care at his residence.
The parents of the two granddaughters had lodged the complaint with the Police after the children complained to their mother about the abuse after attending an awareness programme on child protection.
The parents allege the suspect to have sexually abused their daughters for a long period of time and said that the children have also refused to be left under their grand-father’s care at previous instances.
The suspect will be produced before the Anuradhapura Magistrate courts today.
Anuradhapura Police is investigating.
