Meeting on measures to brace for drought

A special meeting presided by President Maithripala Sirisena will be held today to discuss arrangements to face the prolonged dry spell in the country, State Minister Lakshman Yapa Abeywardena said.
State Minister Abeywardena addressing a press conference at his ministry yesterday said the country was heading towards the worst drought in 40 years.
“The government should find US $ 1.5 billion to face the drought condition. The maximum amount of foreign aids we can expect is about US $ 500 million. About 600 new water bowsers are required to the country. The President has said he would speak to several countries to procure rice and equipment to face the adverse situation,” the State Minister said. “The water in our irrigation tanks and reservoirs are enough only until March. If there is no rain in April, we will be in a trouble.
The World Farmers' Organisation (WFO) has predicted that many families in Chennai would have to survive with one meal per day. The situation here would not be that worse, but our economy will be affected. Our production and export income will go down and various diseases could spread. We must use water and electricity sparingly,” he said.
The State Minister said the Finance Ministry has asked the Disaster Management Centre to inform the amount of money needed to provide relief measures to the people in affected areas.
