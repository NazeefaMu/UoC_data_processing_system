Seylan Bank showcases staff talents at ‘Seylan’s Got Talent’

A highly successful ‘Seylan’s Got Talent’ reverberated in the rafters of Nelum Pokuna recently, showcasing the talented staff of Seylan Bank, as they demonstrated their singing, drama, dance, martial arts and magic acts. Organized by Seylan Bank’s Welfare Association, ‘Seylan’s Got Talent’ was a sold-out event and an outright success.
Seylan Bank Chairman Mr. Ravi Dias, Director and CEO Kapila Ariyaratne, Members of the Board of Directors, Senior Management, Staff, their families and the Bank’s customers were present at the event. During the spectacular evening, 10 talent appreciation awards and five main awards including a grand award were awarded to winning contestants from amongst 28 performances.
This event was open for participation by staff from the bank’s island wide branch network and as a result, many rounds of auditions were held to accommodate the best talent. Yashoda Wimaladharma, Nirosha Virajini and Kevin Nugara made up the eminent panel of judges.
Chathuranga Dilshan of Matara branch was adjudged the overall winner whilst the dance troupe comprising of Vindya Perera, Poorni Wanigasekara, Chethani Wanigasekara and Sanduni Ganegama emerged runners up. Joseph Jayamenan of Batticaloa branch was adjudged Overall 3rd. The winners received glamourous trophies and cash rewards as well.
Rewarding employees for their performance in the workplace is common, but at Seylan Bank, staff appreciation extends across all facets of their personalities and talents, including sports, with staff being recognized at the annual sports felicitation ceremony.
Jayantha Amarasinghe Deputy General Manager Human Resources and President of the Seylan Bank Welfare Association, Seylan Bank, says, “Seylan Bank has an employee pool it can be proud of!
