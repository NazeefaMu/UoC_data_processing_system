Cabinet nod for amending Judicature Act

The Cabinet yesterday approved to amend the Judicature Act to accept the administrative district as the judicial area of a Justice of Peace whose appointments have been made to a judicial division, Justice and Buddhasasana Minister Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe said.
The Minister explained that some of the Justices of Peace have been appointed to a Judicial division, which is generally smaller than an administrative district. He said issues were created when new judicial divisions were formed by dividing the existing ones.
He was speaking at a function yesterday to award appointments of Justice of Peace (JP) to 350 persons at the Buddhasasana Ministry. He said he presented a Cabinet paper yesterday for amending the Judicature Act and the same was approved by the Cabinet. "Those who had been appointed already as JPs for a Judicial Division would automatically be appointed as JPs in the administrative district they are living in after the Act is amended in Parliament in near future," he said. The Minister's Coordinating Secretary and National Youth Council Director Dasun Nagashena addressing the gathering said that the persons rendering a commendable service to society were appointed as the Justices of Peace. He said they could play a pivotal role in society as mediators to bring about peace and harmony in society.
