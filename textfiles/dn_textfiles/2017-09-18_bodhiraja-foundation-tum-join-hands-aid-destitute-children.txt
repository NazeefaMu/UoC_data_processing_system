Bodhiraja Foundation, TUM join hands to aid destitute children

Being in a safe, suitable and stable accommodation is critical all the way from the basics of a child’s development, to the exercising of their cultural worlds. Moving multiple times to temporary accommodations, not having the right space to develop and become autonomous and not having a home at all significantly impact children’s development in a physical, emotional, social and cultural sense. A home is a vital component in the development of children, a starting base if you will and to deny a child that fundamental rights for whatever reason, threatens the good development and outcome for each child who is subject to it.
Ensuring equal opportunities while safeguarding the rights of children who are turned destitute, abandoned and helpless and other children confronted with legal issues as per national policies and international standards is the aim of the Department of Probation and Child Care Services. However, even the department is facing issues to give safe and viable shelter to all destitute children who come under their care due to lack of resources and facilities and third party help at times has been immensely beneficial and most welcoming.
Since 1993, the Sri Bodhiraja Foundation in Embilipitiya, Sri Lanka, has been doing social projects in the poorest areas of Sri Lanka, addressing basic needs of the people and all living beings. More than 10,000 people benefit from the foundation every month. The newest Social Service venture launched by the Bodhiraja Foundation is helping destitute children in the country, those too Tamil speaking ones who have come under the care of Department of Probation and Child Care Services from the Sabaragamuwa province.
Most Ven. Dr. Omalpe Sobhitha Thera, the head of the Foundation, speaking about the latest programme by his organization said, “Recently, we were faced with a wonderful, yet stressful problem. Two years ago, the Commissioner of Probation and Child Care Services asked the foundation whether we could build a Children’s home for destitute Tamil children in Rakwana, Ratnapura District.
This idea had been close to our hearts for a long time. We didn’t have the money to build yet. Despite obstacles we were determined to do this worthy endeavor.”According to Ven. Sobhitha Thera, his foundation had tapped into both local and international contacts for help to make this endeavor a success. “Then we received a call from a university professor in Germany whose summer project for his students was suddenly canceled. He was wondering if we had a social project where they can plan and build a building that his group of 35 developing architects can complete by September 22. Our desire to build the Tamil Children’s home immediately came to mind,” Dr. Omalpe Sobhitha Thera added.
Sobhitha Thera did not hesitate and invited the Professor and his team of budding architects from the Technical University of Munich in Germany to come here and help build a shelter for 25 Tamil-speaking boys under the care of Probation and Child Care Services. A land on a mountaintop in Rakwana was chosen as the children were from Sabaragamuwa province.
The team from the Munich University was headed by Prof. Hermann Kaufmann, Prof. Matthis Kestel, Prof. Hubert Anneser, Prof. Anne Karina Voeikel and included around 27 developing architects under their command.
Ven. Sobhitha Thera, after contacting the team from the Munich, went ahead with the plans to build the children’s home. “We had already spent two years struggling to get all the building permits, legal permissions and community acceptance. So, we were ready to move forward. The Commissioner of Probation and Child Care services was thrilled. Now we are underway with a commitment to finish the project by the end of September and celebrate the building on International Children’s Day on the 1st of October. The home will open in early November,” the Thera says.
The team from Germany came in early August and currently, they are putting the finishing touches to the main building and other facilities in the complex. The German team of around 30 not only came up with the design but put in hard labour as well voluntarily for this endeavour.
This writer recently visited the site for the children’s home in Rakwana and spoke with the team from the Technical University of Munich. Prof. Voeikel, speaking on behalf of her team members, said that after receiving the invitation to implement the project, the budding architects were asked to come up with a viable design and one of the designs was chosen.
She said that this programme is called designer build project and the team had designed an enclosed structure with an open area in the middle which will be used as a courtyard.
According to the Professor, the project for the team is half volunteering to realize a worthy endeavour and half study.
The Professor says that her team tried to use less concrete and use natural products as much as possible and the oval shape will ensure maximum ventilation.
Professror Voeikel added that the land the home is being built is beautiful with healing views, moderate weather in the hills, a playground and natural areas for the boys to grow with a community of loving and caring caretakers to help them.
According Sobhitha Thera, the 25 children will be sent to the nearby school and when they finish school, they will be able to choose what they want next in their lives.
They will be able go on to further higher education that the foundation will sponsor, job training, return to their villages, raise families, or whatever choices they make for themselves. They will be ready to support the next generation with love.
However, the Bodhiraja Foundation also need funds to sustain this worthy endeavour and thus, is seeking public help. Those who want to contribute to make these children’s lives happy and prosperous in the future can contact Sri Bodhiraja Temple in Embilipitiya on 0474931725.
