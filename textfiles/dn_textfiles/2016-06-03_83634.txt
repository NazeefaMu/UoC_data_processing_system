Ireland name uncapped pacer McCarthy for Sri Lanka series

 
 
Barry McCarthy, the 23-year-old uncapped fast bowler, has been included in Ireland's 13-man squad for the two-match One-Day International series against Sri Lanka, to be played in Malahide on June 16 and 18.
McCarthy, who has been plying his trade for Durham in the English county, has been rewarded for his recent form as he bagged his maiden first-class five-wicket haul last month. "It has been a great last couple of weeks and this news has really put the icing on the cake for me. Its been brilliant to play first-team cricket at Durham and to achieve success too, which has given me great confidence should I get a chance against Sri Lanka," the elated youngster gushed.
"Barry has been in tremendous form with Durham and deserves his opportunity. Hes a powerful cricketer who will fit in well with the squad," John Bracewell, the head coach said.
William Porterfield will lead a fairly experienced squad into the series, with seven of the 13 having made more than 100 appearances for Ireland.
"Whilst we as selectors are not afraid to take a punt, continuity is also important. The side selected are proven performers at this level and with a busy summer of cricket we believe starting the season with a strong core of hardened internationals is the place to start," Bracewell explained.
Ireland endured a disappointing campaign in the ICC World T20 as defeats to Oman and Netherlands denied them the chance to advance to the tournament proper. Alan Lewis, the chairman of selectors, however is upbeat ahead of an encouraging fixtures lined-up for the summer.
"After the disappointment of the World T20 it will be great to get back on the horse as it were. Its fantastic that we have so many fixtures this summer, which will put real heat on all to perform," Lewis said.
Full squad: William Porterfield (capt), George Dockrell, Ed Joyce, Tim Murtagh, Andrew McBrine, Barry McCarthy, Kevin OBrien, Niall OBrien, Stuart Poynter, Boyd Rankin, Paul Stirling, Stuart Thompson , Gary Wilson.
