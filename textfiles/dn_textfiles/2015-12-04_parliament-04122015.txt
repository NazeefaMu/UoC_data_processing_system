[Parliament] -04.12.2015

Lanka made history by reducing powers of executive presidency'
Sri Lanka has created a historic revolution unsurpassed by any other country in the South Asian Region by curtailing the powers of the Executive President and transferring them to a strong Parliamentary system, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said yesterday in parliament.
He also said that such a strong Parliament could not be found in South Asia and it was an achievement made without protest or shedding a drop of blood.
The Premier made these observations yesterday joining the committee stage debate on the budget under 22 financial heads including the President, the Prime Minister's office, etc.
He said the new change - the strong parliament - was effected by a National Unity Government and not solely by the UNP. The credit should go to the two main parties although a certain faction attempts to portray this as a UNP achievement.
This change was initiated with the introduction of SLFP Secretary General Maithripala Sirisena as the Common Candidate to fulfill the aspirations of the people. "He reduced his own powers. His view was to reduce more powers but the Supreme Court ruled that it should be carried out under a referendum," the Prime Minister said.
He said the new government set up Independent Public Service Commission, Independent Judicial Service Commission, National Police Commission, Human Rights Commission, Election Commission, Financial Commission, Commission to Investigate Allegations of Bribery or corruption, etc. - which former President Mahinda Rajapaksa refused to set up.
"As all have got together, let us work in the Constitutional Council. All members and ministers should attend sittings to answer the questions" the Premier said. He said if the members including ministers don't attend parliament we can amend the standing orders and make it compulsory to attend Parliament. The Prime Minister also said the Parliament could be made stronger by formulating standing orders to inform the Speaker if a member is being absent.
"We will set up oversight committees chaired by an opposition member, which is a mechanism that can influence the government," the Premier said. "The controlling of finance comes under the Parliament. But earlier all these powers were under the President. This situation was changed after January 8," he said.
"The Cabinet yesterday approved the Right to Information Bill. The Bill to increase female representation upto 25 percent within local government institutions will be presented in Parliament," the Premier said. "The National Audit Bill, the District Development Board Bill and Bill to set up Gramarajya centres are being formulated," he said.
Prime Minister Wickremesinghe said each Gramaseva Division would be given Rs. 1.5 million for its development.
"We will discuss from next Monday with experts to change the electoral system which will be a blend of the proportionate system and the first past the post system to create a stable government," he said.
"In European countries, the election advertisements cannot be telecast during election time. It is banned. We too can follow that system. Even we can make arrangements to provide money through parliament for parties carry out their election campaigns. The members only have to give the bank account details. We can go for this new age. I know some will not agree with these proposals," Prime Minister Wickremesinghe said.
"We can make this country a high income earning country by 2032. A place should be set up in the Parliament for members to meet heir voters. We have only one place - it is this Parliament. We have decided to utilise the Agriculture Ministry building," the Premier said.
He said the members should be granted money and facilities to render their services to the people.
"The expenditure on ceremonies at the President's House in 2014 was Rs. 335 million. It could be reduced to Rs. 34 million in 2015. Expenditure to convey condolence messages in 2014 was Rs. 15 million while it came down to Rs. 300,000 in 2015. Water bills in the buildings of the President's House in 2014 was Rs 44 million and it was reduced to Rs. 24 million in 2015 while Rs. 227 million 2014 electricity bill was reduced to Rs. 91 million in 2015. The expenses for telephone usage in 2014 were Rs. 69 million was reduced to Rs 45 million in 2015 while the miscellaneous expenses at the President's House were at Rs. 732 million and it was reduced to Rs 22 million in 2015.
The Prime Minister said the total amount that could be saved including vehicles, building maintenance, etc. is Rs. 1,476 million. The number of vehicles in the President's vehicle pool was 553 in 2014 and it was reduced to 223 in 2015. He said 158 vehicles had been used by the Presidential Secretariat in 2014 while that figure could be reduced to 116 this year. About 103 vehicles were rented in 2014 while none in 2015.
"A member is given Rs. 15 million through the decentralized budget. With those savings we can allocate more funds through the decentralized budget to the members."
At this stage opposition member Bandula Gunawardena inquired of the pension of the public servants.
"If we speak the truth when we took over the government, there was no mechanism introduced to pay the pensions. If we recruit public servants there should be a way to pay their pensions."
"So we have to develop the economy. When we develop economy the public servants would get more facilities. Today public the servants don't get a good salary," Prime Minister said. He said the country could reach a position to pay a high salary to public servants as in other developed countries.
President's simplicity reflects in budgetary allocation for his office - Rajitha
Health Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratna told Parliament yesterday that it is for the first time in the history that a son of a farmer family has become the President of this country.
The minister said so, while participating at the Committee stage debate of the Budget 2016 for the first allotted day.
"We have elected a pro-people President for the first time. Following the Bandaranaike era, the SLFP entered a family centred era. After the Bandaranaike family, another ruling family was created from Madamulana. The result was the nepotism ruling for a number of years in the SLFP. This was changed after President Sirisena came to power. The simplicity of the President is reflected in the budgetary allocation for the President. Compared to the allocations to the President during the previous regime, this allocation is minimal," Senaratne said.
Transport Minister Nimal Siripala de Silva said the allocation made to the President through this budget is very low compared to the previous budgetary allocations. This shows President Sirisena's simplicity to the world.
"There is a need to change the Preferential Voting system. Therefore, we must introduce the new electoral system with the support of all political parties," he said.
UPFA MP Dinesh Gunawardene said that there is a need to introduce a new electoral system which is responsible to the Parliament. Necessary legislation for electoral reforms need to be presented in parliament soon.
City Planning and Water Supply Minister Rauff Hakeem said it is very important to receive a 2/3 majority for the vote on Second Reading debate of the budget 2016. This can be described as a result of the political consensus.
Skills Development and Vocational Training Minister Mahinda Samarasinghe said that investments will flow into the country if there is a political stability.
Today, the political stability has created in the unity government formed by the two major political parties.
President Maithripala Sirisena goes in the annuls of the history as the Executive President who voluntary reduced his powers.
The made the world to praise and accept him. It is significant that the TNA voted for the vote on second reading of the budget 2016 for the first time in the history.
JVP MP Bimal Ratnayake said that there was a huge number of complaints of massive financial misappropriation by former President Mahinda Rajapaksa.
But no MP in the Opposition countered those allegations. They only made use of former President to come to Parliament.
No good governance in the country - Dinesh
MP Dinesh Gunawardena yesterday said that there is no good governance in the country.
He made this observation joining the Committee Stage Debate on the Budget proposals under 22 financial heads including the President, the Prime Minister's office, etc.
MP Gunawardane said that the government is asking them to support the budget without providing necessary information.
He also said that election laws should be amended and urged to bring laws to change the country's electoral system before Ven. Maduluwawe Sobhitha Thera's three months' alms giving as the President promised delivering a speech at the funeral of the Nayake Thera.
He also urged the government to announce local government election by December 31 after changing the electoral system.
"A total of 335 local government bodies are being administered by special commissioners after their terms expired. How can the government ensure the democracy of the country by keeping local government bodies under the administration of special commissioners,? he asked.
Employment for graduates under one million job programme
National Policy and Economic Affairs State Minister Niroshan Perera told Parliament yesterday the government is formulating a programme to provide employment for graduates who have appealed from 2012.
The minister made these observations in response to a question raised by UPFA MP Dullas Alahapperuma on unemployed graduates.
He said that Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe had given prority to the graduates under the one million job programme.
"We have focused on increasing the income levels when creating one million jobs. Initial steps have already been taken to achieve this goal.

He also said that if there is information relating to new secret detention centres, keep the government informed about them so that an independent investigation could be initiated.
Minister Samaraweera made this observation in response to a special statement made by Douglas Devananda under standing order 23 (2) on Wednesday.
"The government is taking the matter of Tamil detainees seriously," the minister adding that President Maithripala Sirisena and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe would look into ways and means of granting an amnesty to them.
He also said that as mentioned by Devananda, there are instances in the past when detainees were pardoned by respective governments in 1970s and late 80s. Devananda also was one of them, he said. The minister also said that the President and the Prime Minister are already discussing the matter.
Samaraweera said that out of 48 detainees who were arrested under Prevention of Terrorism Act, 39 have already been bailed out.

The minister said that the UN team visited the country following an invitation from the previous government in 2013 and they visited the Trincomalee Navy Camp.
Samaraweera said former Defence Secretary Gotabhaya Rajapaksa had informed in writing to then External Affairs Ministry that he had no issue about such team visiting Sri Lanka. Based on it the UN team visited the country. He said the government informed that there was nothing to hide from them. The minister also said they were allowed to visit the Navy Camp in Trincomalee to prove that there is no secret camps in the area.
He also said that the visiting UN team had alleged that the families of disappeared have complained to them that they have been subjected to harassment by the police. He said the government had informed the UN team to name the policemen involved in the harassment issue. The government said it wouldn't condone them and would punish the offenders.
"We know the attempt taken by our security forces to create a peaceful environment for us to live without any fear", the minister said. "It is the government's responsibility get them rid of the allegations leveled against them".
He said the UN team had thanked the government and added that by these moves the victims, their families and international community would build up confidence on our security forces.
"If there are allegations against previous government or the military, best would be to investigate those allegations thoroughly and prove their innocence," the Foreign Minister said.
The land issues in the North are also being looked into and as part of the moves to release those lands held by the military, a Cabinet paper will be presented. It was to release 6,000 acres of land and hand them back to the rightful owners.
"The government has already released 47,000 acres of lands to their rightful owners," Minister Samaraweera said. "We accept that the release of lands was a slow process. But we would expedite this process,"he said.
The Foreign Minister said that the military will remain at locations in the North where it is absolutely necessary.
"We have just begun our journey. We accept that those people have undergone many hardships. We like and committed to solve all their problems by means of reconciliation," he said.
He added that it was a pathetic situation that a student committed suicide on the matter of the detainees.
The minister also said Jayapalan was not allowed to come to Sri Lanka to attend a literary ceremony held in Jaffna. He said an official had acted in an unacceptable manner in this incident and added that they have forgotten that there is a new era in the country.
The minister also said their traditional mindset has to be changed and added that the flaws in the past should not be repeated.
