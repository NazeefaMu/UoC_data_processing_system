Fifth consecutive win for Tissa Central

The Battle of the Mangosteen limited overs encounter between Tissa Central College and Kalutara Vidyalaya was concluded with Tissa Central completing a comfortable four wicket victory at the Panadura Cricket Cloub Ground and this was their fifth consecutive win in this limited over match history.
The Kalutara Vidyalaya skipper won the toss and elected to bat first on a good batting surface but their batsmen were struggling with Tissa powerful balling attack and they kept losing wickets at regular intervals until the side was dismissed for just 161 runs in 49th over. Tharaka Sandaruwan, who spearheaded the Tissa bowling attack with 4 wickets for Chasing 161 to win, was an easy task for Tissa Central with their strong batting line up. Nilupul Darshana 43 batted superbly and Rohan Sanjaya was unbeaten on 41 runs at the crease and guided his team to a comprehensive victory and they chased down the target in 33.2 overs with 4 wickets remaining.
Kalutara Vidyalaya – 161 (49.3 Overs) (Anushka Lakshan 31, Ravindu Jayawikrama 24 Tharaka Sandaruwan 4/35)
Tissa Central College – 166/6 (33.2 overs) Nilupul Darshana 43, Rohan Sanjaya 41 no, Ramesh Manushanka 34 Anushka Laksha 3/27
