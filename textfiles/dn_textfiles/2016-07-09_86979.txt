Welcome the ICC Test Champions AUSTRALIA

Sri Lanka will be privileged to have the number one ranked Test-playing nation in the world Australia making a full tour playing a series of three Tests, five One-Day Internationals and two Twenty20 Internationals.
Australia will be arriving in Sri Lanka today with their tails up after being awarded with the ICC Test Championship mace as well as a cash prize of US$ one million in acknowledgement of their top ranking.
Steve Smith’s Australians will try to emulate what all past teams from Down Under to Sri Lanka have done by trying to win the Test and ODI series which they have done so successfully on their last two tours here in 2004 and in 2011.
Australia are touring Sri Lanka after five years, the last tour in 2011 saw Michael Clarke’s men win the three-Test series 1-0, the ODI series 3-2 but fail to repeat that success in the T20I format losing to Sri Lanka 0-2.
Ricky Ponting’s side in 2004 made a clean sweep of the Test series 3-0 and won the ODI series 3-2.
So dominant has Australia been both at home and away that Sri Lanka has beaten them only once in a Test match in 26 outings with Australia winning 17 and the rest ending in draws. The one rare occasion was in 1999 when Sri Lanka won by six wickets at Asgiriya Stadium in Kandy and went onto win the three-match series 1-0.
The upcoming Test series will be the fourth to be played for the Warne-Muralitharan trophy which was inaugurated during the 2007 series in Australia honouring two of the greatest spinners the game has ever seen Shane Warne and Muthiah Muralitharan, the only two bowlers to take more than 700 Test wickets in their careers.
Australia has held onto the trophy since its inauguration winning by margins of 2-0, 1-0 and 3-0.
The chances of Sri Lanka laying their hands on that wonderful piece of craftsmanship in the upcoming series will be asking a lot from a team that is in transition. Sri Lanka have just returned from a disastrous tour of England where they were beaten across all formats and had only two wins against associate members Ireland to show for their efforts.
Although they have home advantage past records show that Sri Lanka even at full strength (2004 and 2011) has not been able to ward off the challenges posed by the Aussies.
Thus it is a gigantic task for Angelo Mathews’ inexperienced line-up to try and topple the number one Test side unless the batsmen put enough runs on the board which is something they have fallen short of following the retirements of Mahela Jayawardene and Kumar Sangakkara, the two most prolific run-getters in the country’s cricketing history.
It is not easy to fill those big shoes and Sri Lanka although having a talented side are short of experience to give established teams like Australia a tough contest. Maybe with time they will.
Sri Lanka’s current Test ranking at number seven is a clear indication of where the team is at present.
Since the retirement of Jayawardene at the end of the home series against Pakistan in 2014, Sri Lanka’s fortunes as a Test playing nation has been on a downward trend – losing five of their last six Test series (only win being against West Indies at home in 2015). Overall they have lost 10 of their last 15 Tests (winning four).
Since Smith’s permanent ascension to the Test captaincy last year Australia have won three series (two against New Zealand and one against West Indies).
The Lankan tour will be a real test of skill and nerve for the 27-year-old from New South Wales who like Sri Lanka captain Mathews has a high Test batting average as captain – 87.46 from 11 Tests compared to his overall Test batting average of 60.18. Mathews averages 57.48 as captain and has an overall batting average of 48.70.
The most startling fact is that Smith who made his Test debut in 2010 and has represented Australia in 41 Tests has never played a Test match against Sri Lanka. The upcoming series will see him make his debut in the first Test at Pallekele starting on July 26. The main question that arises when teams like Australia tour the subcontinent is how quickly they can adapt to the conditions and the pitches. Australia is one team that has done so successfully on past tours of Sri Lanka as the results show.
As reports from Australia have revealed the Aussies are not leaving any stone unturned in trying to gather as much information on Lankan conditions having roped in former Test batsman Thilan Samaraweera to provide them with some inside information and on the type of pitches they are bound to encounter and how they could tackle spin on slow and spinning tracks.
Using the expertise of past cricketers on areas of concern has now become a new fad with touring teams. Past Sri Lankan greats like Muralitharan, Chaminda Vaas and Mahela Jayawardene have been used by teams like Australia, New Zealand and England in recent times with success.
