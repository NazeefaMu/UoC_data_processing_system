Oldest  woman

Koku Istambulova defended her title as the oldest woman in the world as she turned 129 recently.
Istambulova's birth certificate says she was born on June 1, 1889. She grew up in Chechnya where she worked the fields harvesting cotton, wheat and corn. Most of her family was killed in central Asia when Joseph Stalin exiled the Chechens, including her two sons.
Istambulova now lives with her grandson after she lost her husband 10 years ago. Her husband also lived to see his 120s.
