Misuse of public assets must be thwarted - Governor

Newly appointed Sabaragamuwa Governor, Niluka Ekanayake yesterday said that the media in the country should work hard to prevent the misuse of public assets in the country by various parties. The Governor was attending a religious ceremony held at the historic Sri Sumana Saman Devalaya in Ratnapura.
Governor Ekanayake further said that in accordance with President Maithripala Sirisena’s policy, she would ensure that all in the Sabaragamuwa province are treated equally.
“No position is permanent and until I am here I hope to use my powers for social justice”, she added.
