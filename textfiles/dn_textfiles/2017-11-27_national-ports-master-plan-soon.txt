National Ports Master Plan soon

A National Ports Master Plan would be put in place very soon, said Managing Director of the Sri Lanka Ports Authority, (SLPA) H. D. A. S. Premachandra.
Speaking at the Sri Lanka Ship Suppliers Association (SLSSA) Annual General Meeting at Kingsbury last Friday he said that this is in addition to the new Maritime policy. He said that these new policies along with the shipping sector liberalization proposal spelled out in the budget would take Sri Lanka towards a true regional shipping hub.
Premachandra said plans were also under way for the launch of the North Port development project of which a section would be extended up to the Kelani River as well. He added that even today several mega infrastructure development projects in the Colombo Port including the laying of new LMG pipe line and rail track is going on. “These are being done to make the Colombo Port more efficient and increase its competitiveness,” he said.

Deputy Master, Capt. Athula Hewavitharana and Managing Director of Sri Lanka Ports Authority, H. D. A. S. Premachandra addressing the event.
Meanwhile Deputy Master, Capt. Athula Hewavitharana said that the ship suppliers sector is rather lethargic in exploiting opportunities that were available in regional ports of Sri Lanka especially in Galle. He said that there are around 600 ships that anchor in the Galle harbour monthly. “Out of this, around 80% of vessels patronize the Galle harbour for weapons and crew changes to provide security for ships operating in areas that have threats from Somali pirates. However it’s sad to note that only around 20% of these ships are serviced by Sri Lankan companies.”
He said that the Somalian pirate issue is now a major focus of the global maritime industry and the issue would be solved permanently very soon. “When the Somalia issue is sorted-out the Galle harbour would lose a lot of opportunities. Hence now is the time that local ship supply companies should come forward and have more dealings with vessels that are engaged in providing security.”
He also said that the association should also look at as to why most of the ships by pass Sri Lanka and obtain supplies from Singapore and Dubai ports. “Is it because local ship supplies have an issue with their pricing, delay in executing the supplier or red tape issues at the Colombo Port,” he asked.
He said that if the delay is with the SLPA they are ready to talk and iron out any grey areas.
Meanwhile Oshan Fernando was elected as the President of SLSSA replacing Hussain Mohamed.
A website to promote activities of the Sri Lanka Ship Suppliers Association (SLSSA) was also launched.
