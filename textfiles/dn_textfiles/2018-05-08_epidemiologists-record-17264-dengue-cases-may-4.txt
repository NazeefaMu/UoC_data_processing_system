Epidemiologists record 17,264 dengue cases up to May 4

A total of 17,264 dengue cases and 14 confirmed dengue deaths had been reported up to May 4, the Health Ministry Epidemiology Unit said.
According to epidemiologists, the highest number of dengue cases, 2,665, had been reported from the Colombo district, while the second highest number, 2,208, had been reported from the Batticaloa district. The third highest number of dengue cases, 1,510, had been reported from the Gampaha district.
The Colombo Municipal Council reported a total of 727 dengue cases during the same period. The other parts of the Colombo district recorded a total of 1,938 dengue cases. The total number of such cases reported from the Western Province was 5,344, they added.
Meanwhile, medical experts and consultants advise the public to seek medical treatment without delay for any type of fever prior to using home remedies. All fever patients need rest and as such, should not attend to work or school.
Such patients should take only Paracetamol; all other medications, especially non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) such as Ibuprofen, could cause Dengue Hemorrhagic Fever (DHF), which could be fatal, they said.
