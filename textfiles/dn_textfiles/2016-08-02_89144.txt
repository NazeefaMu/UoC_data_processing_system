Shivanya to get killed in ‘Naagin’?

The main protagonist of Colors’ top show ‘Naagin’ is all set to die in the coming weeks. Yes, you guessed it right. Shivanya, played by Mouni Roy, will be stabbed by her on-screen mother-in-law Yamini (Sudha Chandran). In a shocking twist, her sister and most trusted accomplice Sesha (Adaa Khan) will expose her true face in front of Ritik (Arjun Bijlani). Her doting husband will see Shivanya’s Naagin avatar while Ankit Raheja is being killed. While he will think that Shivanya is the killer, it is Sesha who has killed Ankit Raheja in Shivanya’s disguise. Ritik will then do the unthinkable.
He will decide to kill his beloved wife. But he’ll not be able to do the same eventually. Ultimately, Yamini (Sudha Chandran) will kill Shivanya in the presence of Ritik by stabbing her. She will also bury her body. So, will Shivanya return in season 2? Only time will tell. India Today
