Bus fares reduced from today

Bus fares will be reduced by 4 percent from today, but the minimum fare of Rs 12 will not change, Transport Ministry sources said.
The Sri Lanka Private Bus Owners' Association agreed to reduce bus fares by 4 percent following a discussion held on Sunday with Transport and Civil Aviation Minister Arjuna Ranatunga.
The price of a litre of petrol had come down by Rs.24 in the past two months and a litre of diesel by Rs.32.
According to the new bus fare revision, the maximum fare of Rs 965 will come down to Rs 924.
The minimum charge of three wheelers raised due to the fuel price hike to Rs.60 has also been reduced by Rs.10 to Rs. 50 in the light of fuel price revisions. It has also been agreed to reduce school vehicle fares by 3 percent.
The government has taken steps to provide these concessions to the public after discussions with public transport organisations.
