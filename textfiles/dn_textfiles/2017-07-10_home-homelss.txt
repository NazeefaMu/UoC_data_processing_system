Home for the homelss

Visakha Vidyalaya, Colombo, is celebrating its centenary year and the calendar is dotted with many events in commemoration and celebration of the journey of a hundred years.
One of the most significant undertakings was by the Senior Prefects’ Guild to build a house for a homeless family who had lost their breadwinner to forces of nature.
Thirty four-year-old Thamara Priyanka Kumari was expecting her third daughter and was living with her husband in Hemmathagama, Mawanella. In a cruel turn of fate, she lost her husband on June 21, 2014. She battled her sorrows and continued to live in a ramshackle hut atop of a rock, while bearing her unborn child. Her older daughter Chanchala Kumari was 14 years old and the second daughter Paboda Kumari was seven years old.
Seventy one-year-old Ranso Hami came to know of her widowed daughter’s plight. Amidst disapproval from her married son’s and daughter’s families occupying Ranso Hami’s dilapidated and crowded house, she took Thamara and her two the daughters into her humble home. She had nothing to offer but her immense love and blessings to her distressed child.
Thamara had nothing to call her own. Existence was on a Samurdhi payment of Rs 3,000 a month. Mawanella AGA Priyangani Pethangoda was their only pillar of strength.
It was the Senior Prefects’ Guild that brought a ray of hope to their meager existence which was well below the poverty line. With the blessings and guidance of their Principal Sandamali Aviruppola and Deputy Principal Kalani Suriyapperuma, the Prefects rallied around this family to shine a beam of light.
They worked tirelessly to raise funds, find sponsors and donors and finance this community service project. They travelled to Hemmathagama to lay the foundation stone on March 15. There they saw the dire needs of the three girls and accelerated the programme.
Within three months, the house was completed. This was made possible by the West Security Forces Commander Major General Sudantha Ranasinghe, along with the Commander 583 Brigade Brigadier Nihal Amarasekara and the war heroes who contributed tirelessly to build this dream home, brick by brick.
The kindness of the prefects did not end there. The beautifully tiled and completed home was fully furnished by them giving these needy children everything to make their home.
These children, who slept on a rock, now have comfortable beds with blankets, sheets and soft pillows to sleep on. They have carved wooden chairs to watch TV or listen to their music on their own radio.
There is also a beautiful, fully-equipped pantry to cook their meals on a gas cooker with all the utensils they would need. They have a modern attached toilet and a traditional one with pipe-borne water and three-phase electricity. They can now study on tables with all the stationary, learning aids and a shelf full of books to excel in their academics. All these are gifted with smiles and hearts full of compassion, hoping they will end the poverty cycle and reach higher echelons to serve our motherland in the near future.
