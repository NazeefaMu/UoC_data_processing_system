Sancharaka Udawa seventh edition begins in May

The seventh edition of ‘Sancharaka Udawa’ will be held at the Sirimavo Bandaranaike Memorial Exhibition Centre at BMICH on May 5 and 6.
This exhibition was first organized on a small scale seven years ago, by the Sri Lanka Association of Inbound Tour Operators (SLAITO), with the intention of providing a platform to showcase products and services offered by the smaller stake holders in the tourism industry.
Though it has has grown significantly over the years the focus still remains the same, and is still the only platform available to the small and medium service providers, from all regions, to exhibit and meet their buyers under one roof. The success of the exhibition, is amply displayed by the demand for stalls which currently stands at around 190 and growing.
Last year ‘Sancharaka Udawa’ had over 160 Companies and individuals participating, with over 230 stalls at the exhibition grounds.
Due to the success of the seminars that were held last year during the exhibition on various topics related to the tourism industry, the organizers are planning to add more seminars to this years’ exhibition too. These seminars will be open to all visitors free of charge.
The primary focus of the seminars this year will be to give young school leavers, an opportunity to learn more about the industry and explore the variety of career opportunities available to them within the industry.
