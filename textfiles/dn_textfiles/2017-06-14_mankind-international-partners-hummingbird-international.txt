Mankind International partners with Hummingbird International

Mankind International recently joined with Hummingbird International to use Mettl ®,a cutting-edge psychometric tool for the assessment of leadership competencies in their recruitment consultancy.
Mettl ® will be exclusively used by Mankind International on their recruitment assignments at the request of their prestigious clientele, to ensure their clients identify the right talent when it comes to their hiring needs.
Mankind International, leaders in recruitment since 1978, stated that their most recent move in tying up with Hummingbird for psychometric testing is a progressive one in the Sri Lankan recruitment industry.
Psychometric refers to ‘measurement of the mind’, and as such will prove to be an invaluable tool for mankind’s current and future clients. It enables employers to conduct a deeper assessment of potential candidates, based on their behavioral competencies resulting in long-term hiring decisions.
