SLFP not opposed to devolution: Nimal

The SLFP is not opposed to devolution of power through a new Constitution, SLFP Senior Vice President and Transport Minister Nimal Siripala de Silva said.
“However, the attention of the SLFP had been drawn towards a new constitution which safeguarded the country’s unitary status of the country and retained the powers of the Executive Presidenty to a certain extent,” he added. Adding that the party had already forwarded its stance on this issue to Parliament, Minister de Silva said the SLFP would express its stand in more detail when the Steering Committee report is debated in Parliament.
