‘Pohottuwa voters abandoned’

At the last local government election, people voted for the Pohottuwa party expecting some change. But those who obtained the people's mandate are not doing any service to the village, Public Administration and Management, and Law and Order Minister Ranjith Maddumabandara said.
The fate that has befallen the people who voted for Pohottuwa can be described by the pithy Sinhala saying ‘Watta Baddata Deela, Essata Datha Niyawanawa Wage”.(Grinning at the fruit after leasing out the land), he said.
The minister was addressing a series of meetings after launching several road development projects in the Madulla Divisional Secretariat Division on October 6.
Minister Maddumabandara said the period of the previous administration could be described as an era of robbery. In his capacity as Law and Order Minister, he said he was aware of the colossal weight of files relating to acts of fraud and corruption committed by the previous regime.
But the time the government took to bring the perpetrators of those acts of fraud and corruption to book was far too long, he said.
He said as a responsible and law abiding government, they could not intervene to expedite the cases as they respected the independence of the judiciary. They would, however, try to expedite these cases and get those guilty punished by trying to expedite these cases.
Minister Maddumabandara said those who spoke about toppling the government had forgotten that it was elected to power by UNPers as well as smaller communities including social activist groups and they would never allow anyone to reverse that mandate.
Uva Provincial Council member Harendra Dharmadasa Banda also spoke.
