For a high-yield vegetable garden

Yields are easier to achieve than you may think. The secret to super-productive gardening is taking the time to plan strategies that will work for your garden. Here are seven high-yield strategies gleaned from gardeners who have learned to make the most of their garden space.
Plant in raised beds with rich soil
Expert gardeners agree that building up the soil is the single most important factor in pumping up yields. A deep, organically rich soil encourages the growth of healthy, extensive roots able to reach more nutrients and water. The result: extra-lush, extra-productive growth above ground.
The fastest way to get that deep layer of fertile soil is to make raised beds. Raised beds yield up to four times more than the same amount of space planted in rows. That’s due not only to their loose, fertile soil but also to efficient spacing. By using less space for paths, you have more room to grow plants.
Round out the soil in your beds
The shape of your beds can make a difference, too. Raised beds become more space-efficient by gently rounding the soil to form an arc.
A rounded bed that is five feet wide across its base, for instance, could give you a six-foot-wide arc above it. That foot might not seem like much, but multiply it by the length of your bed and you’ll see that it can make a big difference in total planting area.
Plant crops in triangles instead of rows
To get the maximum yields from each bed, pay attention to how you arrange your plants. Avoid planting in square patterns or rows. Instead, stagger the plants by planting in triangles. By doing so, you can fit 10 to 14 per cent more plants in each bed. Just be careful not to space your plants too tightly. Some plants won’t reach their full size — or yield — when crowded. Overly tight spacing can also stress plants, making them more susceptible to diseases and insect attack.
Grow climbing plants to capitalize on space
No matter how small your garden, you can grow more by going vertical. Grow space-hungry vining crops—such as tomatoes, pole beans, peas, melons straight up, supported by trellises, fences, cages, or stakes.
Growing vegetables vertically also saves time. Harvest and maintenance go faster because you can see exactly where the fruits are. Fungal diseases are also less likely to affect upward-bound plants thanks to the improved air circulation around the foliage.
Time your crops carefully
Succession planting allows you to grow more than one crop in a given space over the course of a growing season. That way, many gardeners can harvest three or even four crops from a single area.
Stretch your season by covering the beds.
Adding a few weeks to each end of the growing season can buy you enough time to grow yet another succession crop or to harvest more end-of-the-season tomatoes. To get those extra weeks of production, you need to keep the air around your plants warm by using mulches, cloches, row covers, or cold frames. goodhousekeeping
