Azath Salley complains over false allegations

UPFA Mayoral candidate Azath Salley said he had met the Elections Commissioner to complain regarding false propaganda being spread that he had allegedly organised to distribute dry rations to people as a bribe to obtain their votes.
“This is utter lies being spread to tarnish my reputation. I have complained to the Elections Commissioner about this and he requested me to forward my complaint in writing which I will do,” he told the Daily News.
Convening a press briefing earlier yesterday, he said he had nothing to do with the distribution of these goods and said certain parties were clearly seen prompting the women there to say the goods were being distributed by Salley.
