Keells, Cargills purchases vegetables direct from farmers

The two biggest consumer products trading organizations in Sri Lanka, Keells and Cargills Food City have commenced the purchase of vegetables direct from farmers as an immediate solution to the serious problem that vegetable farmers in the vegetable growing areas in the hill country and other areas like Polonnaruwa, Anuradhapura and Dambulla were facing in recent weeks.
This is through an initiative of Minister for Minister of Science, Technology, Research, Skills Development and Hill Country Heritage, Dr. Sarath Amunugama.
A meeting was held recently at the Presidential Secretariat under the chairmanship of Minister Dr. Amunugama, to discuss the problem faced by vegetable farmers. The Secretary to the President, relevant Ministry Secretaries and Government Agents participated at this discussion. The Minister went into this problem in detail at this conference.
The Minister directed the Government Agents regarding the course of action they should take in regard to this matter.
During the course of the discussion the Minister contacted the Heads of the two biggest consumer trading chains, Keells and Cargills Food City and requested them to begin purchasing vegetables direct from the farmers.
Accordingly these organizations have now started purchasing vegetables from the farmers. This way farmers who were faced with the serious problem of not being able to market their crop have received a quick and successful solution.
