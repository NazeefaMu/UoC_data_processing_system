ENVOY TOLD: DON’T OBSTRUCT WORK IN DOHA SCHOOL

President Maithripala Sirisena has ordered Sri Lanka’s Ambassador in Qatar A.S.P. Liyanage not to obstruct work in the Stafford Sri Lanka School in Doha for any reason, Higher Education and Cultural Minister Dr Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe said.
MP Wimal Weerawansa charged that the school administration had been taken over by the Sri Lankan Ambassador in Qatar because it had a fund of Rs 450 million.
The minister said the President intervened into the matter after receiving complaints from parents living in Qatar.
“The President ordered the Ambassador to continue the work of the school without any interruption, and that he will negotiate and settle the other pertaining matters.
The Ambassador promised the President to run the school in a manner that does not affect the children,” he briefed the House.
MP Weerawansa called on the Government to safeguard the only school for Sri Lankan students in Doha. Deputy Minister Buddhika Pathirana joined in stating that this sorry state of affairs was a result of appointing an unsuitable person as a diplomat. He said an adjournment motion on the same issue will be moved in Parliament on Friday by UNP MP Asoka Priyantha.
