Royal S. Thomas’expect a cliff-hanger

The Royal-Thomian semi-final clash in the Milo inter-school Division 1 President’s trophy knockout rugby tournament is expected to be a cliff-hanger at the CR & FC grounds, Longden Place today at 4.30 pm.
S. Thomas’ has brought in young Hans Walpola to play in the pivotal position of fly half at the expense of Bumindra Dissanayaka who is expected to be on the bench and will most probably play in the second half if needed.
In the pack, seasoned campaigner Dhanuja Wijeratne will play as number eight alongside their cracking flankers Shaniv Ahangama and Cristian Dilleal in the third row. Tehan Perera and vice captain Malinda Deshapriya has been moved up to the front row to bind down with hooker and captain Pandula de Silva.
The forte of both teams has been their power-packed forwards. The Royal ‘eight’ especially Ayesh Maduranga, Hamza Hassan, Azmir Fajudeen, Harith Lokugamage, Hisham Barrie, Pasindu Amarasinghe, Ashen Fernando, Maleesha Madumewan and captain Nikhila Gunadheera are expected to give a terrific display in the loose and secure ball position.
If they deliver and get their act together to proceed with the famous rolling maul then the Royalist will have a chance of pulling off this game.
However they face a huge challenge from the Thomian forwards spearheaded by their cracking number eight Wijeratne who will be ably supported by Tehan Perera, Pandula de Silva, vice-captain Deshapriya, Senanayake, Mack, Ahangama and Dilleal.
In the set scrums experienced Royal hooker Fajudeen should get the better of his vis-a-vis de Silva, while the line outs should be shared between the Royal duo of Lokugamage together with Madumewan and Thomian line out jumpers Senanayake and Mack.
Royal’s new halves combination comprising Wijekumar and Calyanaratne are playing really well in the latter stages even though they are playing together for the first time this season. Everything will depend on how they will click as a pair in this crucial match. Meantime the S. Thomas’ will hope that their highly talented scrum half cum play maker Shenal de Silva will pair off well with his new fly half Hans Walpola.
In all probability, Shenal de Silva should try to set his speedy three quarters in motion at every given opportunity, as they have two hard running wing three quarters in Praveen Ferdinando and Naveen Heenakankanamge who has stood out with his powerful runs down the flank together with their experienced centres Ashwantha Herath and Sarith Nanayakkara. This is in addition to their speedy full back Gayan Wickramaratne who is there to join the line and form the overlap.
