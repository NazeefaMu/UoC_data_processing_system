Decisions on expressways taken after careful study: RDA Chairman

The decisions regarding the construction of the expressways, especially whether those expressways should be built on the concrete columns or on the filling lands, were taken after a series of careful studies and researches. They were carried out by engineers, environmentalists, surveyors, scientists and technicians attached to the Road Development Authority, Ministry of Higher Education and Highways, Central Environmental Authority, Land Reclamation Cooperation, and Geological Department, a statement issued by Road Development Authority Chairman Nihal R. Suriyaarachchi said.
The statement added that these officers are being considered as highly reputed government officers and veterans of that particular study fields. They had taken those decisions considering one hundred years of past and future weather patterns, floods, and natural disasters etc.
At present, the Road Development Authority makes arrangements to construct the Central Expressway according to the recommendations especially on concrete columns and filling lands made by the experts. The RDA will implement the most suitable and optimum costs system to build the Central Expressway under the instructions of the Ministry of Higher Education and Highways, the statement said.
“In the meantime, we have noticed that some parties who have no proper understanding or proper knowledge are attempting to mislead the people. Although the correct facts of the Central Expressway were revealed by me with a group of officials at a meeting at Kurunegala, incorrect information is being circulated by those parties,” Suriyaarachchi said.
“Further, I wish to request any organization or parties to propose a better plan to construct the Central expressway than the plan prepared by the RDA.
The costs for those studies can be paid by the RDA,” he added.
