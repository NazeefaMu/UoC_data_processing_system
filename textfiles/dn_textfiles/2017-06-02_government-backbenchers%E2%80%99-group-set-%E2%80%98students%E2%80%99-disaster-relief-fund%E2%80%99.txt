Government Backbenchers’ Group set up ‘Students’ Disaster Relief Fund’

A special fund has been set up by the Backbenchers’ Group in the Government to help the flood and landslide affected schoolchildren, UNP MP Prof. Ashu Marasinghe said.
Addressing a press conference at Sirikotha yesterday, he requested all Parliamentarians to donate a month’s basic salary to the ‘Students’ Disaster Relief Fund’.
“Account number 809123012 of the BOC Parliament branch has been opened for this purpose.
The fund is open to anybody who is willing to contribute. The money collected to this fund will be utilized to provide for the needs of the disaster affected children in a very transparent manner,” he said.
“To begin with we request all MPs to donate one month’s salary that amounts to Rs 54,285.
However, many have already expressed their willingness to donate more than that,” he said.
Education Minister Akila Viraj Kariyawasam said he has ordered a report on the schools affected by the recent disaster situation, adding that a decision on re-opening them would be taken following the receipt of this report on Friday.
He said as identified about 25,000 students have been affected, adding that all of them would be provided with a relief pack that includes uniform materials, text books and exercise books.
“We will also provide a pair of shoes to them, but it will take more time as we have to follow the tender procedure,” he said.
MP Prof. Marasinghe said in addition to providing for the needs of school children, they would also initiate student counseling to help disaster affected children to recover from the post disaster trauma. Moreover, the MP said the Backbenchers in the Government would also launch ground level campaign to raise public awareness on recycling of solid waste and Dengue control.
