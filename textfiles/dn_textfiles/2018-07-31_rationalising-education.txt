Rationalising education

A confrontation over appointments of Principals and other Grade appointments have become a subject of contention between the Teachers’ Unions and the Ministry of Education. Fortunately, a strike was averted by the intervention of President Maithripala Sirisena, which however is a temporary stop-gap solution. This is not the only issue in education management.
There are many more and even far more basic problems such as school admissions, shortage of physical and social infrastructure etc. Hence, it is time opportune for a public dialogue on what ails our education system. The trade union dispute is only a symptom of a much more basic problem.
Education is a multi-stakeholder function in the society. A human being’s education starts with birth and ends only with death. It is a life-long pursuit. The family, school and society all play significant roles in education. As such it is much more than formal schooling, which is limited to a relatively shorter period of a man’s life - 10 to 13 years at the most. This means that the society has a wider responsibility for education and a greater role to play in its development.
Quality education
While it is the task of educationists to decide on content and mode of delivery of education, ordinary citizens could and should be concerned about them. The present writer is no exception. He is also a layman and has only his personal experience as a student, teacher and parent in presenting these comments. However, everybody has an idea what education is and what it should be. Hence, paraphrasing Anatolio Gramsci we could say “every man is an educationist while those who call themselves as such are those who specialize in it”. Whether an educationist or not, “everyone has a role to play in improving education”, says Irina Bokova, Director General of UNESCO.
According to UNESCO, a good quality education is one that provides all learners with capabilities they require to become economically productive, develop sustainable livelihoods, contribute to peaceful and democratic societies and enhance individual well-being.
Democracy contributes to ensuring equity in providing education opportunities to everybody irrespective of social, ethnic or religious differences. On the other hand, education equips citizens with the civic knowledge to manage modern societies with equity and well-being.
The Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR) and other international human rights instruments recognize education as a fundamental human right. They declare that it is the duty of the State to provide education to all. According to the United Nations, governments should spend at least 4 percent of the GDP or 15 percent of its expenditure on education.
Though the private sector has entered the field of education in a big way the responsibility of the state regarding education does not diminish or gets reduced. It is responsible for its content and standards. UNESCO notes that the private sector would be very vital supplementing what the government is doing but they are too expensive for the common man. However, it also notes that since education is incompatible with market competition private education increases inequality.
There have also been various conceptions of the content of education too. From early days education was considered to be the acquisition of knowledge about the three R’s – Reading, (W) riting and (A) rithmetic. Later it was found to be inadequate to produce productive citizens and a wide range of functions was added. Even this limited the scope of education to acquiring knowledge with no emphasis on personality development or the need to produce persons who would be capable of making rational decisions in managing their personal and social lives.
Nowadays too there is a school of thought that education should be oriented towards jobs or employment. This leaves out the valuable aspect of knowledge for knowledge’s sake. Such an approach often tends to neglect humanities with resultant drawbacks in culture.
It has also been found that such knowledge alone tends to produce “conformists” rather than creative individuals who could face new challenges in life. Hence creativity has been added to knowledge as a content of education. For example, a strategy report for primary schools in the United Kingdom says: “As well as giving them essential tools for learning, primary education is about children experiencing the joy of discovery, solving problems, being creative in writing, art, music, developing self-confidence as learners and maturing socially and emotionally”.
Creative and innovative human capital
Sweden’s national education development plan states that schools shall provide “conditions for developing creative schools”. In Germany “developing creative abilities” in children is emphasized. Educational reform in Japan has identified creativity as the most important objective of education for the 21st Century.
Thus developed nations have already taken a step forward in realizing futuristic economic development for it requires a more creative and innovative human capital. However, most developing nations are yet to appreciate the value and necessity of creativity and innovation. It is evident from the paltry sums they spend on Research and Development. As one commentator has noted Asians are consumers of “Western products” and as a result, they have lost “self-identity” and “self-independence”. Therefore, he prescribes creativity and productivity in education as an essential requirement for Asia.
It has to be seen how far distant Sri Lankan education system is from these modern objectives. The latter is an objective necessity in the socio-economic and political context of our time. Hence, those calls that demand a retreat to ancient educational practices are reactionary in nature though some of their positive traits could be assimilated.
Our education system needs change. The present emphasis on rote learning should be replaced by a student-centric system where the emphasis should be to promote original thinking, creativity, entrepreneurship and innovation among learners. Similarly, the present torturous examination system where students are surprised with riddles instead of verifying their knowledge and abilities should be replaced with a student-friendly system. Students as the main stakeholders should also receive democratic representation in taking decision affecting their lives.
