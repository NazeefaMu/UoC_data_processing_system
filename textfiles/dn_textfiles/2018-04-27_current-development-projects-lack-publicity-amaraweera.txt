Current development projects lack publicity: Amaraweera

Owing to poor publicity networks, people are unaware of current development projects being carried out by the government. The country's TV channels do not provide necessary coverage for such projects, Fisheries and Aquatic Resources Minister Mahinda Amaraweera said.
He was addressing a gathering following the opening of the new jetty, accompanied by Fisheries and Aquatic Resources State Minister Dilip Wedaarachchi at the Tangalle Fisheries Harbor.
The jetty covers a 1,000-square metre area [100 m (length) x 10 m (breadth)] and would enable the docking/mooring of eighty fishing crafts.
The minister said there was a plea for his removal from the United Peoples' Freedom Alliance General Secretary post and added that he would resign when President Maithripala Sirisena provides his consent.
He said that the 16-member group of ministers who forwarded the No-Confidence Motion against Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe, was making allegations against him and other ministers.
