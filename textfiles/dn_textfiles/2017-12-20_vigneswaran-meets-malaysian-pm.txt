Vigneswaran meets Malaysian PM

Malaysian Prime Minister Najeeb Razak yesterday met Northern Province Chief Minister C.V. Vigneswaran. The Malaysian PM tweeted, “Had a very fruitful meeting with His Excellency C.V. Wigneswaran, Chief Minister of Sri Lanka’s Northern Province. We have agreed to work together towards supporting the redevelopment of the province and uplifting the Tamil community there”. The Chief Minister in turn had briefed the PM on militarization of the North and the issue of civilian land being held by the military, the plight and livelihood issues of widows and ex-cadres and the lack of funds available to the Provincial Council to carry out development work.
