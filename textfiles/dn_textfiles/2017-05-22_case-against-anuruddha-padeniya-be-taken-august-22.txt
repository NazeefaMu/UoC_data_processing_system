Case against Anuruddha Padeniya to be taken up on August 22

 
The case against Government Medical Officers Association’s (GMOA) President Dr. Anuruddha Padeniya will be taken up on August 22, the Appeal Courts said today.
Two civil society activists filed a Contempt of Court action in the Court of Appeal on May 4, seeking Court’s Constitutional jurisdiction against Dr. Padeniya for allegedly undermining the Court of Appeal judgement to register South Asian Institute of Technology and Medicine (SAITM) MBBS graduates at the Lanka Medical Council (SLMC) as medical practitioners in terms of the Medical Ordinance.
