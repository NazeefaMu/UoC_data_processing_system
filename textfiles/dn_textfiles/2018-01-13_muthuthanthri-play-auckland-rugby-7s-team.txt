Muthu has opened the door for others to follow and brought great honour to our country. As the first Sri lankan to represent a top Provincial side in New Zealand , Sri Lanka Rugby wishes him the Very Best and will continue to support his progress.
He have given us all great hope, that nothing is impossible and to see him go from a young man playing at S’ Thomas’ College Mount Lavinia to the National team and now to New Zealand Provincial representation, is simply outstanding” concluded Seneviratne.
