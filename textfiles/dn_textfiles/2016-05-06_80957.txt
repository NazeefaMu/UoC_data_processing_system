Parliament adjourned amidst tense situation

Parliament was adjourned for a short while amidst a tense situation when the passing of the Supplementary Appropriation Bill was being discussed.
 
Yesterday a tense situation prevailed during the last few minutes in Parliament when Joint Opposition and JVP members claimed the results of vote on the Supplementary Estimate of Rs. 55 million were incorrect.
 
Declaring the results, presiding member Lucky Jayawardena said 33 voted for while 31 voted against. However, after scrutinising CCTV camera footage, it was decided that the result was incorrect. According to the investigation, 31 had voted for and 31 had voted against. Due to this situation, the vote would have to be taken up some other day.
 
The debate on the Supplementary Estimate commenced at 10.00 a.m. and lasted until 6.00 p.m.
 
At 5.45 p.m. JVP Parliamentarian Anura Kumara Dissanayake asked for a division and the quorum bell was rung for five minutes. Once the vote was about to be completed some members were heard saying a few other members had come to the House and needed them to be counted. They were also added and the decision was declared. However, when the decision was declared, Joint Opposition and JVP member shouted in protest of the results alleging it was incorrect. Some were seen walking into the Well of the House.
 
Meanwhile, presiding member Lucky Jayawardena adjourned Parliament until 9.30 a.m.
