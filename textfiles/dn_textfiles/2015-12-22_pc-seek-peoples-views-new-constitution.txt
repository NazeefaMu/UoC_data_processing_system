PC to seek people's views for new constitution

A Parliamentary Committee will be appointed soon to entertain ideas and views from the people to formulate a new constitution that would enshrine the hopes and aspirations of the people, Justice and Buddha Sasana Minister Dr. Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe said.
This Parliamentary Committee would accept public ideas and views from January 9 to March next year. The proposed new constitution would be a constitution framed by the people. Its significance would be that all policies, principles and decisions included in it would be based on people's ideas, views and aspirations, he said.
