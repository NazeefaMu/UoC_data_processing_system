Expatriate worker defrauded of earnings by sister’s paramour

A man who allegedly defrauded a 37-year old Muslim woman working in Kuwait of the money she had earned overseas, was arrested by officers of the Anuradhapura Police crimes division recently.
This follows a complaint made by the woman expatriate worker, on her return to Sri Lanka for a brief holiday. In her complaint, she said that she had remitted her salary to her sister’s bank account for the last five years. She had remitted cash amounting to nearly Rs. 2 million in this manner. Her sister lives in the Kadathiha area in Anuradhapura.
When she returned home and asked her sister for her money, she found that there was hardly any cash balance lying to her credit in the account.
When she asked her sister what happened to the money, her sister told her that her paramour had used the money at his will, since she had handed over the relevant ATM card to him for his use.
The expatriate worker also said her sister had fallen out with her due to her complaint to the police and expelled her from her house.
Police said investigations revealed that the expatriate woman’s sister had been living with her paramour since her lawful husband was paralysed and bedridden. Further investigations are continuing.
