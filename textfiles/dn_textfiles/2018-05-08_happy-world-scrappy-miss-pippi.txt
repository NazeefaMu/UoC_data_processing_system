Happy world of the scrappy Miss Pippi!

Some names, both fictional and real are unforgettable. Why do female literary characters stay with readers long after they’ve finished the books these personalities are featured in? Often, it’s due to the intimacy with which readers have come to know a character.
Take Jane Eyre , for example, who becomes so real to readers that they feel as if they’ve met and understood this amazing female personality. Also, Scarlett O'Hara the central character in Margaret Mitchell's 1936 novel ‘Gone with the Wind,’ Mary Poppins, the magical British nanny and George Bernard Shaw’s Eliza Doolittle are all fictional protagonists unlikely to be forgotten.
My kid sister Ann must have been around 14 when I was a young adult journalist. As all ‘nangas’ usually do she made some telling demands on both my time and my rather impoverished financial portfolio at the time. She once insisted on my buying her favourite books for leisure reading. Being in an altruistic mood I queried whether she would fancy a set of Enid Blyton paperbacks.
She spun around eyes blazing and fired: “Enid Blyton! Enid Blyton! That’s just kids’-stuff! What do you take me for! A baby? ” Taken aback I apologised and said in my most appeasing tone that she could choose her own literature. You see, my diminutive baby sis, growing up under the shadow of three rough-and-tumble older brothers was as the Yanks would describe ‘quite a tough cookie’.
She said that her mind was set on books by Swedish author Astrid Lindgren. I conceded that I had never heard of her and inquired what the books were about. She eyed me with what seemed a pitying look reserved for a moron and exclaimed: “The books are a rage all over the world. Everyone knows the name of the famous character Lindgren writes about. She is more famous than your wicked James Bond!”
Feeling a total ignoramus, I sought enlightenment . “And what is the name of this renowned character?” The answer sounded like a thunderclap in my ear. “Why, Pippi! Pippi Longstocking!” Stunned, I asked her to repeat the name and she did with a tuneful rendition of her fictional heroine’s theme song: “I am Pip-pi Longgggstocking, how I love my funny na-ame-o!”
That did it! The name sounded so darned suggestive, particularly from a Sri Lankan perspective and I believe in the French lingo as well. I inquired whether the books contained some sort of coarse toilet humour. I imagined the contents would include gross jokes replete with repugnant allusions to bathroom fittings. I mean those unmentionable fixtures such as urinals and arsenals. The latter description is credited to a former Kandy municipal councillor while referring to commodes.
Towering over my pint-sized sibling I drawled in my most menacing manner: “Sorry, but I am not going to buy you crude reading material. And that’s the end of it!” She looked at me in a compound of astonishment and anger and remonstrated: “Crude! You must be off your flipping nut! Pippi is an angel compared to your dirty James Bond with his farmyard morals and his killer instinct. Just glance through one of Pippi’s adventures and see for yourself what a heroine she is.”
So I strode into a leading Colombo bookshop. The young female sales assistant sported a ‘trainee’ tag pinned to her blouse. I casually inquired where we could find Pippi Longstocking books. She looked at me in bewilderment and approached two young colleagues chuckling nervously all the way. I repeated my request clearly enunciating the words P-i-p-p-i Longstocking. The trio began tittering fit to die.
An elderly woman supervisor wondering what the amusement was about appeared from the aisle with a no-nonsense glower. One of the trainees, her composure totally out of control, tried to explain between hysterical giggles: “He wants ... Pip ... Pip ...Pippi!” I repeated my request to the glaring presence as she eyed the giggly gaggle. She smiled benignly saying: “Children’s section, Sir. And sorry for the inconvenience.” Inconvenience indeed! Relieved I told her that I was not, decidedly not, seeking any sort of other convenience.
I later learned to my utter embarrassment that my initial suspicions about the character Pippi Longstocking did not hold water. She was in truth an unusual young girl. She is financially independent since she owns a sackful of gold pieces. She can shoot a revolver with the skill of a Calamity Jane and sail the seven seas with piratical intent. She is both defiant and kind and can out-lift the strongest man in the world. .
How the heck was I to know that Pippi Longstocking was indeed a girl rebel, who supposedly helped liberate children all over the globe? In her storybook world, she has stood up for the weak and oppressed. So it is not strange that the anti-authoritarian Pippi is censored in dictatorships and conservative states and that she has aroused the fury of many tyrannical adults.
I also learned from my chatty sibling that Pippi was the strongest girl in the world. She also dispenses with a burglar by simply lifting him up onto the top of the wardrobe. Naturally, many young readers, especially girls, envy her jolly life and secretly wish they could behave as she does. How the devil was I to know that Pippi girl had for years become a source of inspiration in the struggle for gender equality? As far as little sis was concerned Pippi was still the hero of the day.
Subsequently I did read one of the books to be enlightened that she frequently pokes fun at and hoodwinks adults she encounters, and her stance is likely to appeal to young readers. However, Pippi usually reserves her worst behaviour for the most pompous and condescending adults.
One might be constrained to believe that she is a direct descendent of the ageless Peter Pan. And in similarity to that captivating mythological character her life has been an outstanding and wondrous adventure in an escapist ‘Never Never Land’ of child-like imagination. Throughout the world, girls have been encouraged to have fun, to be a bit more daring and to have faith in their own ability. Pippi Longstocking has performed wonders.
Walking into the pantry I found my sister helping the maid make pancakes. Ann asked me whether I had read the adventures of her heroine. I said I did and enjoyed it thoroughly. If you question why I ran for my life it is because she pursued me with the hot saucepan. And just because I added the amendment: “But a girl named Pippi! Surely, it sounds like a brand name more suitable for a sprinkle-tinkle fountain!”
So until next week let me bid you farewell in true Brit-style. Cheerio and pip-pip hooray!
