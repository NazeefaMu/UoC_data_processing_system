It is allege that a fraud has been committed in identifying lands supposed to be get submerged to the Horowpotana Yan Oya reservoir which is under construction. The fraud has been detected at a special investigation by the Forest Conservation Department.

He had complained that an outsider was to dig sand from the land belonged to him. According to the Forest Conservation Officials, it was found that no permit or grant had been issued to such a landscape and the president’s land grant was issued only for 1.856 hectares whereas this figure was fraudulently altered as 4.85 hectares having amended two boundaries deceitfully.
