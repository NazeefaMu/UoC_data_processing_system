Restraining order on garbage dumping extended

Batticaloa Magistrate M. Ganesharaja extended the restraining order for another 14 days when the request of the Batticaloa Municipal Council to allow them to dump garbage at the Thiruperunthurai Solid Waste Management Centre was taken up for hearing recently.
The case is to be heard on September 29. Dumping garbage in the Batticaloa town is causing serious health and sanitation concerns. The recent fires at the centre has worsened the situation. Residents of the area have filed a court case requesting a restraining order on the garbage dumping.
Thirty families were resettled in the area from distant places like Sammanthurai in 1990 by then Rehabilitation and Resettlement Minister A.H.M. Ashraff.
They are to be shifted to another place by authorities. But they oppose the suggestion saying that they would lose their residences as a result.
Civil organisations and residents of the area protest urging the authorities to resolve the issue.
