Why Should an exporter apply for an Export Award

Recognition and reward of exporters by the State in many developed and developing countries which accord priority for exports for their economic development, has become an important approach.
This approach is stated to have commenced originally in South Korea several years ago, long before the World Trade Organization (WTO) came into being and imposed rules and regulations for the conduct of international trade between countries. At that time South Korea is stated to have heavily subsidized exports of her enterprises by the State, to be competitive in international markets. Accordingly the Presidential Export Awards which came into being in South Korea is stated to have been patronized by the President himself. However, since then rules and regulations related to international trade under the WTO does not permit subsidizing of exports in an indiscriminate manner.
Japanese products
It has also come to be known that all potential exporters, as well as established export enterprises, who participate at events which accord recognition to their achievements are “winners”. In this respect it is stated that following the devastation caused by World War II, European countries had been averse to import Japanese products due to their inferior quality and standards. However, Japanese entrepreneurs through their participation at events which recognizes and benchmarks their achievements related to exports, had been able to make vast strides in the improvement of the quality of their products, so much so that in the years that followed, European countries had been reluctant to import Japanese products due to their relatively higher quality, and low cost, which affected the domestic enterprises of those countries.
In Sri Lanka too, following the liberalization of the economy in the late 1970s, the Government commenced under its patronage, through the Export Development Board, “The Annual Presidential Export Awards” to recognize and reward the achievements of the Sri Lankan exporters, to give them enhanced exposure and compete effectively in the international market place, to accelerate the economic development of the country. This event was given patronage by the State at least at the subject Ministerial level, if not by the Head of State.
Reward achievements of lankan exporters
Thereafter the National Chamber of Exporters (NCE) which is the only private sector chamber that exclusively serves the Sri Lankan exporters’, and represents them with the relevant state authorities, stepped into fill this void to recognize and reward the achievements of Sri Lankan exporters. This event conducted by the Chamber which had humble beginnings, with the conferment of a few awards under low key, has grown over the years to achieve national significance, as the most looked forward to Business Event in Sri Lanka. The event which is the only event of its kind that has been conducted over the past 25 years without a break, has been attended by over 750 participants comprising the cream of the business community in Sri Lanka, especially exporters and service providers to exporters, the political leadership, members of the diplomatic Community, high level state officials and special invitees. It is conducted with much glitter and glamour at a five star hotel, and has achieved a high standard of professionalism, credibility, transparency, and recognition, due to its high quality judging process by an independent professional panel of judges who are competent in the various aspects related to exports, assisted by a separate technical panel of experts, and professional inputs provided by the well-known multinational audit firm Ernst & Young.
Theme
The organization and conduct of the event each year is under a “theme” based on the history of Sri Lanka related to international trade, and current trends. Accordingly the event last year was conducted under the “Theme” related to the “Polonnaruwa era” of Sri Lanka’s international trade.
The event this year will be conducted on the 28th of September in the Main Ballroom of the Shangrila Hotel Colombo, based on the conduct of the “Oscars” in the USA. A question that would naturally arise in the minds of many is, why should an entrepreneur, potential exporter or an established exporter apply for recognition at this event, and what are the benefits that would accrue to a participant.
The main benefit that would accrue to a participant enterprise, is the recognition and exposure related to its achievements and standard of business in the international market place, to attract the attention of potential buyers of Products and Services, to enable enhancing of exports, and long term sustainability of the enterprise through the expansion of business activities. In this respect, participating enterprises and exporters are accorded the opportunity to showcase their achievements through market promotion activities conducted overseas, by bench-marking the products and services related to their quality and standards. Such market promotion activities also facilitates the attraction of joint venture partners as well as investors, to infuse capital, technology, and know-how as well as access to markets for overall benefit.
Specially designed logo
Award winners under the various product and service categories which are comprehensively covered by the event, are also accorded opportunities under all four categories of enterprises, namely small, medium, large and extra large, depending on their export turnover, to incorporate a specially designed logo for three years from the date of receipt of awards in their promotional material.
In the above context it is also pertinent to mention that in addition to the General Export Awards conferred in respect Products and Services, based on their volume and value as well as export growth, and other aspects related to international trade based on modern trends, “Special Awards” are conferred to recognize the achievements of exporters related to the other aspects, to give them additional exposure and benefits in the international market place.
Special awards
These special awards cover achievements in value addition, impacts on the environment which includes Waste Recycling and the use of Renewable Sources of Energy, Innovation and Differentiation of Products and Services, Branding related to the achievements of registered Sri Lankan brands, as well as achievements in Emerging Markets. Special awards are also conferred to the best SME exporter and the Best Woman Exporter benefitting these special categories. Further, the event this year will include special awards to export oriented enterprises which recognize the contribution and skills of “Disabled Persons”, which aspect receives increasing international recognition according to the criteria established by the United Nations.
Award winners at the event also receive immense publicity to their achievements, through the award winning website of the Chamber www.nce.lk to invite the attention of a vast international clientele.
Sri Lanka Exporter magazine
Further wide publicity is also accorded to award winners through the quarterly Sri Lanka Exporter magazine published by the Chamber and distributed to all important trade points both locally and especially overseas, including the Chambers of Commerce and industry in overseas markets and Foreign Trade Missions. The magazine particularly highlights the success stories of award winners related to their achievements in all important aspects of international trade, which comprise in addition to the special features mentioned above, issues related to the General and Financial Management of an enterprise, long term sustainability of the enterprise, Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) activities which impact positively on society, as well as Quality Systems and Standards and Management Development Systems installed and implemented within an enterprise, which undoubtedly would have pointed impact on prospective buyers.
The Award Winning Trophy is itself designed to depict the sustainability aspects of an enterprise related to the triple bottom line of Profitability, People (Human Resources) and the Planet (the environment), which focusses on the achievements of the awarded enterprise related to these three aspects.
In addition to the features outlined above, which serves to attract buyers as well as benefit businesses and in export expansion; winning an award also facilitates enterprises to motivate their employees, by enabling them to witness the fruits of their labour, hard work, and commitment, to achieve further improvements in productivity, thereby ensuring the overall competitiveness of an enterprise in the international market place.The event also benefits all participating enterprises to benchmark their standards against the related international standards, to enable improvement of their weak areas under the guidance of the Chamber. This aspect particularly benefits not only award winners to improve further, but especially those who fail to win an award, to grow, and achieve recognition in the international market place.
All in all winning an export award at the NCE Export Awards, makes an exporter an ‘Icon’ in the field of exports, in the eyes of all stakeholders; especially in the eyes of existing buyers of products & services, and particularly in the eyes of ‘prospective buyers’.
