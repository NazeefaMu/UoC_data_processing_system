Every Tamil in Sri Lanka affected by violence: Sampanthan

Opposition Leader R. Sampanthan yesterday said every Tamil in the country was affected by violence and deprived of rights.
The Opposition Leader said 1.5 million Tamil people fled the country because they were deprived of their rights.
“We want the remain to live with dignity and those who have left the country to return,” he said.
Sampanthan was discussing the issues with visiting US Assistant Secretary of State, Ambassador Alice Wells at the residence of the US Ambassador to Sri Lanka Atul Keshap.
Sampanthan apprised the Ambassador on the political situation in the country and the matters pertaining to the Constitution making process.
He highlighted the need to draft a new Constitution which will preserve and protect the dignity of all people in Sri Lanka.
“Unlike previous times, this time much ground work has been done to draft the new Constitution and we cannot afford to allow the process to fail,” he said.
Speaking on the power sharing arrangements in the new Constitution, Sampanthan said genuine power sharing arrangement was vital, and people should be able to decide on things that matter to their day-to-day life.
