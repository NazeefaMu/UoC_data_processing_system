Mustapha differs on Mirissa issue

Provincial Councils and Local Government Minister Faizer Mustapha yesterday expressed concerns regarding the decision to remove illegal business places in the Mirissa coastal area.
Musthapha said illegal business places along the beach should be removed, but that it should not affect the livelihood of small time businesses and shops.
He was commenting on the recent statement made by the Coast Conservation Department of a plan to remove all illegal business places in the Mirissa coastal area.
Minister Mustapha said the tourism industry has seen a considerable growth in the Mirissa area.
He noted that such action should not let the people engaged in tourism industry lose their sources of income.
“It is not good governance to let average people be affected by certain decisions.I will look into the people’s side of the story and inform the authorities,” Mustapha said.
