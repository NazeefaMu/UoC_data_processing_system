‘Prime Minister provided Rs. 500 million for  development of Galle’

Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe has provided Rs. 500 million for development work in the Galle District, said Home Affairs Minister Vajira Abeywardena.
The Minister was addressing a United National Party (UNP) election meeting in Samagi Mawatha, Galle.
He said they are taking steps to further improve the Karapitiya Hospital in Galle, which at present is the third largest hospital in the island.
The dental, haepatology, and lung units for children are currently being planned to be built there.
“We have laid the foundation stone for a Rs. 250-million, seven-storeyed children’s hospital complex, and we will complete it in 2019,” the minister said.
The Home Affairs Ministry, he said, has relieved many grants from the Asian Development Bank and added that those funds would be used to develop dilapidated religious places (Buddhist, Hindu, Islam, and Christian) around Galle. “I came into politics to work for the people, not to fill my pockets. To this day, I do not even own a Tikiri account in any bank.
After entering politics, many politicians purchase petrol sheds, hotels, and tea estates, but I will help the general public purchase hotels and petrol sheds,” he added.
He asked that the public vote for the UNP and ensure their majority in Galle at the upcoming local government polls.
