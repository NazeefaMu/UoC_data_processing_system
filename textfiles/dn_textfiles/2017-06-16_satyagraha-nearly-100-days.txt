SATYAGRAHA FOR NEARLY 100 DAYS

Some of the relatives of missing persons engaged in a Satyagraha campaign for nearly 100 days opposite the Governor’s office in Trincomalee protesting over the failure by the authorities to provide information about their loved ones jumped into the sea saying it was pointless for them to live any longer but they were rescued by another group engaged in the Satyagraha yesterday morning. The group of relatives waded into the water and began to hurl abuse against the government for its failure to heed their request.
But the other group insisted that they should continue living for the sake of their remaining children.
Sandya Ekneligoda, wife of missing journalist Prageeth Eknelgoda were among the group which jumped into the sea with the objective of ending their lives. Some Intelligence officers who were taking video photographs of the relatives’ association secretary Mrs. Nagendran Jeyalakshmi alias ‘Asha’ left the scene when she abused them. She said they objected to outsiders covering the event other than media personnel.
