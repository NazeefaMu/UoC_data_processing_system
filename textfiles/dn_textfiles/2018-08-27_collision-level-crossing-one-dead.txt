Collision at level crossing; one dead

A trishaw which tried to cross a level crossing ignoring railway signals collided with a train at Wanawasala, Kelaniya killing one and injuring two others.
The trishaw collided with a Colombo-bound train at the Hanson Town railway crossing close to the Wanawasala Railway Station at 5.50 a.m. causing one death and injuring two.
The injured have been admitted to the National Hospital and are said to be in a critical condition.
The deceased has been identified as Mohandas Prabhakaran, a 31-year-old male from Bogawanthalawa.
The Main Control Room of the Railway Department stated that the train service in the main line resumed shortly after cleaning of the debris of the three wheeler.
Last week Transport and Civil Aviation Minister Nimal Siripala de Silva said a Rs.25,000 fine will be imposed on errant drivers who ignore railway level crossing signals in order to minimise accidents.
According to the minister, there around 75 fatal accidents at railway level crossings annually due to motorists ignoring the signals.
The minister also said that CCTV cameras will be set up near busy railway crossings to identify errant drivers who violate railway crossing signals.
The minister said strict legal action will be taken and hefty fines will be imposed on those who violate the signal rules.
