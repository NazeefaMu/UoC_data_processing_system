US withdraws fromI UNHRC

The United States said it was withdrawing from the United Nations Human Rights Council on Tuesday, dismissing it as a “cesspool of political bias” for its anti-Israel stance.
Meanwhile, US Ambassador to Sri Lanka Atul Keshap met with senior Sri Lankan officials yesterday to convey the assurance of the US Government that it will remain fully engaged with the Sri Lankan Government to help it meet its continuing and standing commitments to the international community to advance the cause of reconciliation and lasting peace for all Sri Lankans, the US Embassy in Colombo said.
“We will follow Sri Lanka’s progress closely and look ahead to engaging with Sri Lanka between now and March 2019 in the spirit of friendship that has marked our recent relations. As Sri Lanka takes further steps outlined in the Geneva resolution, the United States will also support and expand our bilateral partnership.
“Sri Lanka co-sponsored with the United States two UN Human Rights Commission Resolutions: 30/1 in 2015 and Resolution 34/1 in 2017, and the United States continues to extend its support to Sri Lanka to fulfill these important commitments and obligations as articulated and reaffirmed in these resolutions. Sri Lanka’s continued progress toward fulfillment of these international commitments will facilitate further growth of our bilateral relations and enhance Sri Lanka’s ability to engage with friends and partners around the world,” a statement issued by the US embassy said.
The US withdrawal marks the latest rejection of multilateral engagement by the Trump administration - following its exit from the Paris climate accords and the Iran nuclear deal - and comes a day after the UN’s most senior human rights official condemned the US for separating children from parents at the border with Mexico.
Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and US Ambassador to the UN Nikki Haley issued the announcement, with Haley saying the Geneva-based organisation was “not worthy of its name”.
Haley described the council as a “protector of human rights abusers” and accused the body of “politicising and scapegoating countries with positive human rights records”.
She said the decision had not been taken lightly, and added: “We take this step because our commitment does not allow us to remain a part of a hypocritical and self-serving organisation that makes a mockery of human rights.”
