Hidden language of the soul

 Today in the Indian classical dance forms face a lot of confusion about the style differences about the existing styles of Kathak and Bharatha Natyam. Especially among the Indian classical dance forms Bharatha Natyam and Kathak dances have different styles. It is a must that there should be a proper understanding and knowledge about the styles of Indian classical dances among the audience, and the Fine Arts faculties of the universities of Sri Lanka about the styles of Indian Classical dances.
Bharatha Natyam is one topmost outstanding classical dances of India. It preserves its own identity in the international spheres. Whatever it is, in the international spheres Bharatha Natyam has its own identity with its glamour. In practical Bharatha Natyam field, two main existing popular styles are facing severe cold war within the dance field itself.
Different styles
It is a pity to note that most of the followers of these styles criticise one another. Originally there were four different well-known styles existed. Those were Pantha Nallur, Vazhuvuoor, Thanjavur and Kanchipuram. Thanjavur and Kanchipuram have virtually disappeared.
Bharatha Natyam is basically divided into Nirtha, Nirthya and Natya. Nirtha dance is firmly based on pure Adavus (steps) and poses. Adavus (steps) are fundamental in any dance, and these Adavus are generally common to all dances. Adavus are executed with selective Thala (rhythm), Laya, and Kala (tempo). In Bharatha Natyam the category of adavus is same for both the styles. But in the way of execution of Adavus, reflect slight and certain variations.
These slight variations came into being, due to the approaches of different teachers stationed in different areas.
These slight differences have given a popular misconception that there are different types of Bharatha Natyam. It is wrong to say that Bhartha Natyam could be divided into two different types of Bharatha Natyam. It is more appropriate and correct to say that Bharatha Natyam has two different styles or two different schools in Bharatha Natyam instead of saying two different types of Bharatha Natyam or two different categories of Bharatha Natyam.
There is a vast difference between the two terminologies of style and type. The word style is different from the word type.
The word style reveals the methodology of execution. The term type reveals the nature or character of one. Hence one must understand the basic differences between the two terminologies. Among the two existing styles of Bharatha Natyam, the Vazhuvoor style of Bharatha Natyam gives more preference and importance to the facial expression, bava and rasas. The execution of adavus in Vazhuvoor style is gentle rather than that of the Pantha Nallur style.
Practical performance
Pantha Nallur gives more importance to the Nirtha especially it emphasises the firm and stiff way of execution of adavus (steps). Anyhow, outwardly it is said that Bharatha Natyam has no style differences.
But practically in the performing field, it is noticeable that Bharatha Natyam has certain differences between the two existing styles. Vazhuvoor style and Pantha Nallur style are the main existing style in the Bharatha Natyam field with their certain identity.
 
Theoretically, Bharatha Natyam styles have no differences. Both the styles of Bharatha Natyam follow the same theory. Basically, History, origin, development, a number of Adavus and category of adavus remain the same for these two existing styles.
The eye movements, neck movements, body positions, leg positions, leg movements, hand positions, hand movements, hand gestures, divisions of Abinayas, are same for both styles.
Generally, style is a framework of individual teachers but it has not changed the basic concept or aspect or format of the selective dance form. Bharatha Natyam remains as Bharatha Natyam whatever the styles it is.
Pantha Nallur style has an exceptional beauty in the way of performing the pure Nirtha; meanwhile, Vazhuvoor style has an excellent beauty in the way of execution of Nirthtya aspects such as facial expression, Bava and rasa.
It gives more room for the imaginative creativity. In the Pantha Nallur style, the scope of expressions is limited. But both the styles have their own excellence and their own footing, despite certain differences.
Mediocre artistes
But unfortunately, the present dance world of Sri Lanka has missed the capability of comparing and analysing the differences, of these two outstanding and existing Bharatha Natya styles with a broad mind and manner. Followers of each style are always projecting and praising their own selective style as the best style and ridicule the other style. All these occur due to the ignorance of the mediocre artistes.
Similarly, four main styles also exist in the other Indian classical dance Kathak. Those are Lucknow style, Banaras style, Jaipur style and Varanasi style. But the two main and major popular styles or schools in Kathak are Lucknow and Jaipur styles. Kathak originates from the tradition known as Katha. The Sanskrit lexicon defines Kathak as ‘storyteller or narrator of drama'. According to certain historical evidence, Kathak dance came into being from a particular social community named kathaka, who were the custodians of this dance form. Professional storytellers of this caste dramatised the epic and religious stories with full expression, miming and acting.
Kathak also originated in temples. Later, it developed in the royal courts. During the 19th century, Kathak faced a new era. Kathak is considered as an outstanding classical dance form of India. It is proud to be a fusion of Indo-Moghal cultural trends. Especially, this particular dance form flourished under the Moghul Empire. Kathak is the only classical dance form of India closely linked with Muslim culture and Muslim traditions.
Thakur Prasad and his two sons Kalka Prasad and Binda Din served in Wajid Ali Shah’s royal court. They are fully responsible for the development of Lucknow Gharana (style).With the passage of time, under their guidance beautiful verses, rhythmic syllabus and melodious musical compositions were introduced. This gave birth to the Lucknow Gharana.
Dance movements
Graceful and expressive Bhava, are the predominating characters of this Gharana. Yet, this Gharana also uses maximum footwork. A special feature of Kathak is that the dance movements even in high tempo are enriched with bhava, rasa, and abhinaya. It is generally believed that the Jaipur Gharana, originated in Rajasthan. The credit for developing this style goes to Iswari Prasad Misra who himself belonged to a traditional Kathak family. After his death, his family members continued his work. Kathak was also preserved in the royal courts by another ruler in Madhya Pradesh named by Raja Charander Singh. He wanted to bring the two different styles together. As all other styles of classical dance forms, two different styles of Kathak do not have rigid differences in the basic concept of Kathak.
As in classical Bharatha Natyam, the so-called styles were developed by the gurus stationed in different areas. The styles are imaginary creations of the masters who developed certain aspects in the dance. It is worthy to mention that the martial arts such as Karate, Khufu and Judo also have their own different styles. Simply it could be said that these differences arose due to the adoption of certain different techniques.
