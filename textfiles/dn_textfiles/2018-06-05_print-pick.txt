Print  pick!

Of all genres, poetry should be the most neglected genre in this country. Composing poetry is not proper investment even in the aesthetic market. Using English medium is even worse. When a certain community neglects poetry, it tends to miss so much. That is happening in Sri Lanka now.
With internationally acclaimed poet Jean Arasanayagam bagging the 2017 Gratiaen Award, we can rest content: poetry has attracted some attention.
English literature of this country has been a cornered subject mostly confined to an elitist class who speaks in that language. When the majority shies away from a certain language, its literature cannot reach for the upper ledges. Circumstances attendant on Sri Lanka’s English literature are no different.
Things are changing, thankfully. If there was a time when bookish customers scoured the bookshops for Jane Austen, Nicholas Sparks, Ian McEwan and the like, that phenomenon is witnessing a gradual about-face. Shehan Karunatilleke, Lal Medawattegedara, Vihanga Perera, Malinda Seneviratne, Elmo Jayawardane and the like have launched moving the bookshelves.
And who deserves kudos for this trend?
No one in particular. But the Gratiaen Prize has played some part in that mission. The Prize has grown up over the years with a substantial amount of criticism levelled against it adding up to its maturity. What the State Literary Award, with its share for English fiction, could not achieve for years, the Gratiaen could accomplish single-handedly.
That is something that the Gratiaen Founder, Michael Ondaatje, could rejoice over especially as the Prize celebrates its 25th anniversary this year. Incidentally, Ondaatje’s initial source of inspiration, Man Booker Prize, celebrates its 50th milepost this year as well. Unlike the Gratiaen, the Man Booker Prize has a tough competition in Britain, of course, with a host of other literary prizes.
Why a literary prize, after all? Are they an essential requirement for the growth of the literary landscape? Or are they an impediment to the literary growth? Whatever the answer is, we cannot control the existence of literary prizes.
Popular fiction hardly needs any market push. The classics need a push with some force. How do you differentiate between classics and popular fiction? Popular fiction could not be always the pulp fiction, while classics should not be always the Jane Austen type. The popular/classics division should not bar our reading habit. But we require that to justify the literary awards, especially as both the Gratiaen and the Man Booker Prize have chosen the classical works. As for the definition of modern classical work, a hint of definition comes from an interview with Shehan Karunatilleke published in Roar.lk.
The question is posed to Karunatilleke: Speaking of Anthony Burgess, it was he who came up with this division of the A writer and the B writer. The A writer is primarily a storyteller. The B novelist is a language stylist. Where would you fall?
Karunatilleke responds: You’d like to fall in the overlap. But I think I’m guilty of being a B novelist, a language novelist. I do spend a lot of time crafting prose. I mean, it’s a difficult thing to do, and I do enjoy beautiful writing which doesn’t necessarily have a plot. But the storytelling, the plot, I find harder. The beautiful sentences come easily to me. I revise all the time. Sometimes too much. I’ll first write it to the end. For example, I wrote this in the morning, got to the end of it. It’s a mess, but I got the main purpose of that scene down. I’ll probably spend this week, as a procrastination method almost, and go back and do the editing and revising. Then I’ll leave it and move on.
Sometime back in these columns, Ashok Ferrey expressed a similar sentiment with the term ‘overwrought’ to describe the similar writing exercise.
Most classics are an offshoot such overwrought or overwritten exercises. They may not reach a wider audience like the popular books since the latter is more given to plots and storytelling. That’s where they need some encouragement like a literary award.
Founded by Michael Ondaatje, a Sri Lankan-born Canadian novelist in 1992, had the first award ceremony in 1993. That Ondaatje set up the Gratiaen Prize with the money he received as the Booker Prize for The English Patient is now known to almost everyone.
The Gratiaen Prize accepts printed books and manuscripts in a range of genres including fiction, poetry, drama, creative prose and literary memoir. Entries can be submitted between December 1 and 31 every year. These are assessed by a panel of three judges appointed by the Trust who are required to short-list three to five entries. The short-list event (open to the public) is usually held in April and hosted by the British Council, Colombo. A cash prize of Rs 200,000 is awarded in recognition of the best work of creative English writing.
When Tissa Abeysekara received the Gratiaen Prize for ‘Bringing Tony Home’ it did not receive much public attention. Abeysekara passed away leaving his legacy as an eminent artiste but least known for his English novel. But the situation was different when his daughter, Charulatha Abeysekara, bagged the award. That was subject to the more public limelight.
The prize money of the Booker Prize was originally £21,000, though it was raised to £50,000 later in 2002 under the sponsorship of the Man Group, making it one of the world’s richest literary prizes. Bernice Rubens was the first female author to secure the Booker Prize for The Elected Member. Alice Munro’s The Beggar Maid, shortlisted in 1980, is the only short story collection that remains to be shortlisted. Before 2001, the long list of nominees was not publicly revealed.
Whether the English language has a particular word for those who buy books but not read them or not, we are yet to know. But the language can certainly borrow a word from Japanese: Tsundoku. That is the fate usually prevalent with the classics. You buy the book for its cover and to show off the status, but hardly interested in reading. If the literary prizes will change that trend will remain a question.
