Weird rugby rituals

Stevie Wonder penned the line "very superstitious" as a hit song and it seems the world's rugby players have been listening.
A number of current oval ball (and a heap of former) stars - and even coaches like Steve Hansen - are clearly obsessed with pre-match and during match rituals and superstitions.
One recent survey of top sportsmen and women found that 13 per cent of them thought that touching the tunnel ceiling in the entrance to the playing field was key to their performance. Others revealed they would deliberately vomit to settle their nerves. We scoured the files and found nine unusual examples of past and present Rugby World Cup players and the strange rituals used to help give them a psychological edge.
Dan Biggar (Wales)
It was England's 2003 Rugby World Cup hero Jonny Wilkinson who is largely credited with rewriting the book when it comes to the lead-up to his goalkicking attempts. The recently retired Wilkinson is famous for his meticulous pre-kicking routine which included grasping his hands together and raising them up to his chest. Wilkinson's sequence has been mimicked ever since but Welshman Dan Biggar has taken it to a new level. The match-winner against England when he nailed a penalty goal from halfway in Wales' 28-25 win last Sunday, Biggar's pre-kick routine was tagged as the "Biggarena" by London's Daily Telegraph. His idiosyncratic routine has proved an internet sensation.
Steve Hansen (New Zealand)
He won't reveal why he does it but next time the TV cameras focus on the All Blacks coach during a game, watch him rub his nose with his finger. It's a deliberate act but Hansen won't say if it's a superstition or a signal. Some have speculated the nose-rubbing is an in-joke with Sky TV's commentary team and a signal to let them know that Hansen believes the All Blacks have the match under control no matter what the scoreline might say. Whatever, keep it up Steve...it's working!
Mike Catt (England)
He's better known by New Zealanders as Jonah Lomu's doormat in the 1995 World Cup but Englishman Catt was a RWC 2003 winner and is currently in charge of coaching England's backs. He has a similar "tic" to Hansen in that he touches his ear during the singing of England's national anthem ahead of matches. It was originally intended as a way of sending a visual message to his family, watching from home. But the routine is now a ritual for Catt.
David Campese (Australia)
The unpredictable Aussie winger had one noticeable foible. He had to be the last player to run out on the pitch in any game he played. Leaving the dressing room last seemed to work well for 'Campo' but it did blow up in 1996 at Wellington's Athletic Park when he turned his back on the haka, kicking a ball to himself under the goalposts. The All Blacks were unimpressed, with Jonah Lomu running rampant as New Zealand racked up a 43-6 scoreline in the last test ever played at the famous ground in the capital.
Alan Whetton (All Blacks)
The World Cup-winning All Black loosie from the 1987 squad was surprisingly superstitious in his playing days. "I used to have a little ritual in the changing shed," Whetton said. "I would put the jersey on a peg by itself - it would command a lot of respect. So I would look at it. I used to have my togs, boots and mouthguard in a bag below - they didn't quite warrant being together with the shirt. Also, 40 minutes before a game at Eden Park, I would go round to each corner and would imagine myself dotting down in that corner. I used to pat the grass thinking: 'That could be AJ's spot.'"
John Smit (South Africa)
The World Cup-winning Springbok skipper of 2007 has a dark secret - and one loosely associated with the All Blacks. Throughout his entire illustrious career which included leading South Africa 82 times in a 110-test career, Smit only ever wore black underpants when he played. He believed wearing any other colour would jinx him and his team. -NZHERALD
