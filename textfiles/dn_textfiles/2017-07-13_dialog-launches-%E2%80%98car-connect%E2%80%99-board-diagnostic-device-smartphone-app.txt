Dialog launches ‘Car Connect,’ on-board diagnostic device, Smartphone app

Dialog Axiata recently announced the launch of Car Connect, an advanced Vehicle On-Board Diagnostics (OBD) device and smartphone app providing vehicle performance and driving diagnostics.
Car Connect is to be one of the many revolutionary solutions introduced under Dialog Smartlife, the digital lifestyle and Internet of Things (IoT) platform of Dialog.
Car Connect differentiates itself from other GPS providers by offering a wider range of services than just location based information. It is a cloud based diagnostic platform that offers vehicle owners feedback on the status of their vehicles; allowing users to make sense of all the data generated by their vehicles such as vehicle health, driving habits assistance, engine performance, fuel economy, trip analytics and many more.
Explaining the intricacies of the Car Connect solution by Dialog Smartlife, Asanga Priyadarshana Head of Business Mobile Telecommunication said, “The launch of Car Connect makes it possible for vehicle owners to monitor information and statistics on vehicles with complete accuracy.
The solution offers a host of reports and makes it possible for an individual or businesses to manage multiple vehicles with ease.”
Car Connect can be used in any vehicle that supports OBD II (vehicles manufactured after 2005) by connecting to the OBD port.
The solution also features a speeding alarm that will alert drivers once a preset speed limit is exceeded, a Geofence alarm which will alert users when the vehicle leaves a designated area, a towing alarm for when the vehicle is being towed and an Idling alarm that will alert the user when the vehicle engine is switched on for a set period but does not move.
Explaining the safety diagnostics included in Car Connect Chris Fraser Director of Inno3 and partners of CarIQ Technologies explained, “Car Connect comes with Driving Diagnostics, offering information on hard breaking and rush acceleration, gear usage ratio, harsh turns and high RPM, as well as alerts to stay under speed limits. “
The device will be available at Dialog Iconic, Mega Centre, Negombo, Kandy and Kurunegala Customer Care Centres. Car Connect smartphone app can be downloaded from the Google Play.
