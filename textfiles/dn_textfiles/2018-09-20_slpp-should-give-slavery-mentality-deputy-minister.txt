SLPP should give up slavery mentality - Deputy Minister

Mahaweli Development and Environment Deputy Minister Ajith Mannapperuma said yesterday that the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) has become a party of Rajapaksa’s slaves today.
“We urge the SLPP members to give up this slavery mentality and put forward a candidate who can compete with us and who will be accepted by all in the party,” he added.
“Former President Mahinda Rajapaksa has said since his son is not yet 35 years old, he will try to nominate one of his brothers as the next Presidential candidate.
“We wonder whether there is no one else in the Pohottuwa party other than Namal Rajapaksa,” he added.
“So far this year the government had released Rs.2,104 million to provide drought relief for the people,” the Minister said.
“In addition, the government had also provided 11,000 water tanks which cost about Rs.91 million together with 407 water bowsers,” he added.
