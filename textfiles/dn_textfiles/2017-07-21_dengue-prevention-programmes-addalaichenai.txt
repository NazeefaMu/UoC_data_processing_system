Dengue prevention programmes in Addalaichenai

The Addalaichenai MOH Office, Divisional Secretariat, Akkaraipattu Police and Pradeshiya Sabha launched a dengue prevention programme in Addalaichenai Divisional Secretariat areas.
Following this, programmes are being carried out to eradicate dengue in all Grama Niladhari Divisions. The coastal cleaning programme was held at Addalaichenai, recently. The government departmental officials, traders, residents and students participated.
Dengue fever is on the rise again in the Ampara district coastal areas. Awareness programmes on dengue prevention are being conducted.
Due to rains, low-lying areas along the coastal belt are inundated which are breeding grounds for mosquitoes.
Residents who have mosquito breeding locations were identified and were warned to clean their premises.
Garbage kept for a long time is another cause for the spread of dengue, officials said. Residents were warned that legal action will be taken against offenders.
The main drainages along trunk roads and internal drainages are being cleaned and distilled to prevent the spread of the disease. Bare lands are also cleaned.
Those who suffer from fever for over two days should seek immediate medical attention from a qualified doctor or a State hospital, officials warned.
