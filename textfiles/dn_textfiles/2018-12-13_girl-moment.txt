Girl of the moment

The month of December belongs to Sara Ali Khan. At long last, after a stretch of three years and some more, the daughter of Saif Ali Khan and his former wife Amrita Singh, is being launched with two high-profile films: Abhishek Kapoor’s ‘Kedarnath’ and Rohit Shetty’s ‘Simmba’.
In fact, 2018 may well be remarkable for introducing two Bollywood family talents: Sara and Janhvi Kapoor, daughter of the late Sridevi and Boney Kapoor. The latter made her debut with the well-liked ‘Dhadak’, opposite Ishaan Khatter, which was produced by Karan Johar. Both in terms of personality and attitude, the debutantes seem to have what it takes to become quintessential Bollywood heroines.
Indeed, from the moment Sara was in her teenage years, she had been noticed by filmmakers who wished to cast her in their films as soon as she was ready to take the plunge into show business.
As for the incessantly watchful Bollywood grapevine, so far they have linked her with Anil Kapoor’s son Harshvardhan and one Veer Pahariya, who comes from a political family. However, right now it is being said that she is unattached, and is focusing on her career.
