Coconut cultivation boosted in A’pura

Coconut cultivation is in progress in the Anuradhapura district.
Coconut Cultivation Board Anuradhapura Regional Manager W.M.S.W. Bandara said the acreage of coconut in the district has expanded by 16,000 acres during the last few years.
He said the acreage of 36,000 a few years ago has increased up to 52,000 acres. The Regional Manager said coconut will be grown in minimum 500 acres in every year to achieve the target of 100,000 acres of coconut in the Anuradhapura district by 2020. Bandara said DC mill owners and vegetable oil businessmen were the deciding factor of coconut prices in the market. The trend will be changed for the benefit of consumers, he said. The Regional Manager said a programme to provide water supply systems to small scale plantations is underway. Dolomite is introduced to coconut lands to avoid the scarcity of magnesium and keep the wetness in the soil, he said.
A programme is promoted to enhance the coconut harvest. Small scale plantations below 2 1/2 acres are issued fertilizer subsidy. The "Kapruka" micro interest loan facility scheme is implemented in addition to "Kaprukai - Parapurai" project to encourage farmers, Bandara said.
Coconut plants are provided to parents free on behalf of a newly born child under the "Kaprukai - Parapurai" project.
"We have taken steps to prevent mite and red beetle menace from spreading in coconut plantations in 22 Divisional Secretariat division level. We suffer from lack of staff, he said.
Bandara said Rs. 25 million has been allocated for coconut development activities for 2017 in addition to Rs. 34 million to provide fertilizer subsidy for small holdings.
