‘Displaced by NWPCP to receive alternative lands’

People who would be displaced in the Kandapalla-Korale area of the Matale district under the North Western Province Canal Project (NWPCP), would be provided with alternative lands and compensation, Matale District Parliamentarian and District Co-ordination Committee Chairman Ranjith Aluvihare said.
He was addressing an awareness programme on displacement due to projects such as the NWPCP.
Under the project, 350 tanks in the Kurunegala and Matale districts are to be supplied with Mahaweli water.
The water scarcity in the areas near the tanks would be quelled with the completion of the project within the next five years, Project Director Neil Bandara said.
The Wayamba Ela Project is funded jointly by the Asian Development Bank and the government. Rs. 16 million would be spent on the project, while about 13,500 families would be benefitted. Over 30,000 acres would also be developed, NWPCP director Asoka Perera said.
"We appreciate these development activities, but it should be carried out sans partiality. The activities of certain officials are unfair. We have not yet been provided with information regarding our compensations. Some officers said the government would pay Rs. 6,000 per perch. It is unfair,” Ranwediyawa Mahasen Farmer Organisation Chairman D. G. Pabilis said.
