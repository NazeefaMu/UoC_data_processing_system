President, the real target of NCM - Mangala

Finance and Mass Media Minister Mangala Samaraweera yesterday said the real target of the No Confidence Motion (NCM) was the President.
In an interview with ITN, he said this NCM was not against the Prime Minister but a means to come into power through the back door by politically bankrupt forces that have been defeated in elections twice. Though the NCM is against the Prime Minister, the real target is the President.
The President is protected by the UNP and the PM, and those who are against the President know this very well, he explained.
He stressed that the NCM tried to remove that protective layer, bring in a new Prime Minister, they can manipulate, change the Speaker and finally make Mahinda Rajapaksa Prime Minister though the back door.
“Thereafter, they will bring in an impeachment motion against the President-that is their true aim,” Minister Samaraweera said.
“This is what they are attempting to do but this attempt too will be defeated and it will only remain as just another attempt,” he added.
