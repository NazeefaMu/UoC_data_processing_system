Savour the season!

‘Ceylon Olive locally known as Veralu is a species indigenous to Sri Lanka. Veralu grows on medium sized trees that are naturally grown in home gardens across the country. The green oval shaped unripe fruit is boiled and seasoned with salt and chili powder and sold as pickles known as Veralu Achcharu which is a popular street food in Sri Lanka. The ripe fruit can be eaten with sugar or jaggery. In addition to its addictive taste it also has important medical benefits. Garden Talk speaks to Director of Institute of Indigenous Medicine, Swarna Hapuarachchi to discover the many benefits of Veralu.
"Veralu is a tropical plant. You can see it in the Indian Sub-Continent, Indo China and South East Asia. It is a medium-sized tree. The leaves of the tree have medicinal value while the fruit also has various health benefits," said Hapuaracchchi.
Veralu which has the botanical name of Elaeocarpus Serratus comes from the Elaeocarpaceae family. "Veralu fruit is smooth, green and oval shaped and is very similar to the Olive externally. The tree is very attractive with red and yellow leaves among the green. It has an astringent quality and after ripening it is sweet and acidic. Actually it has a very peculiar taste," stated Hapuarachchi.
Preparation
Veralu can be prepared in many ways. It can be prepared as Veralu Achcharu or as a curry or it can be eaten as a fruit.
"Boil unripe or slightly ripe Veralu in salted water, then drain it and place it in a bowl. Add pepper, Chili flakes, some sugar and a little Vinegar and mix it thoroughly. The result is a delicious dish! You have a super Achcharu!" she says about pickles made of the fruit.
