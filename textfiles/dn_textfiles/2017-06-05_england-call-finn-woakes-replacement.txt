England call up Finn as Woakes replacement

London: Steven Finn will replaced injured fellow paceman Chris Woakes in England's Champions Trophy squad, the International Cricket Council confirmed Sunday.
Woakes was ruled out of the rest of the 50-over tournament, which features the world's top eight one-day international teams, with a side strain suffered while bowling just two overs at the start of England's opening Group A win over Bangladesh at the Oval on Thursday.
The experienced Finn, 28, will join the England squad ahead of their second match of the tournament, against New Zealand in Cardiff on Tuesday. AFP
