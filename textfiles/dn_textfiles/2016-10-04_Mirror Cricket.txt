Mirror Cricket

Harping back to my cricketing days in England, the month of March heralds, The Spring and this glorious day, the first truly beautiful day of spring. You can feel the adrenalin surging through your veins. For, as Tennyson so sagely wrote (and was subsequently misquoted), in the spring a young man’s fancy turns lightly to thoughts of cricket. The World is waking up after the long winter, and so are you. You stare out of the window, dreaming of battling half-centuries and instinctive diving catches at deep gulley. /
Bright sunny March days is one of God’s cruelest tricks for they promise so much and deliver so little. From within it all looks so inviting. But should you make the mistake of venturing outside with thermal long johns and four pairs of socks, you will surely suffer the consequences, as local authority workmen have to be called to chip you from the pavement.
Playing cricket therefore is out of the question, unless you fancy a new carrier as an ice sculptor. So confused by the deceitful gleam of the chilly March sun, you grab your trusty ruler and you play the first of the thousands of forward defensives in front of your bedroom mirror. /
All things considered, it’s remarkably easy to time the ball with a ruler. Suddenly you hear a distant rumble and you are at the crease, padded, helmeted ruler in hand, as Curtly Ambrose storms in from the horizon and the Sabina Park crowd bay for Anglo Saxon blood. Typical that the sights screen should be too low at that end. How are you supposed to see the ball coming out of your hand? But then you can blame yourself if he is a little fired up. You shouldn’t have hit his last ball for four. Three slips and two gullies wait as he roars in towards the crease. He bowls. You can barely see it, its viciously swift, but hang on, it’s a little short----------and wide--------- and luckily the pitch has eased a little this morning, and you are seeing the ball like a base ball, so you rock back, watching it all the way to the sweet spot, and you don’t feel a thing, and it rockets away to the point boundary. A huge cheer from the crowd-they love a good contest. The man down there did not have a chance. You glanced round. Richie Richardson is shaking his head in despair. They had the match virtually won before you came in. You must feel sorry for him. But don’t get cocky. Your fifty may be on the board, but the team needs a big hundred from you. Concentrate don’t relax for a moment. Ambrose is back and this time he over pitches and you lean effortlessly into the ball-zing. Lots of red marks ,on the centre of your bat today. Whoosh through extra cover, past the fielders’ outstretched hands, and straight into the advertising hoarding before you finish your first run. And all this after you dismissed Brian Lara with your first ball of the day. Man of the match? man of the series---------
Then you wake up, and it’s March again. Richie Benaud is always droning about light bats, but perhaps someone should tell him how potent a well balanced ruler can be in the right hands. It’s just a shame you are not so fluent holding a real bat. Mirror cricket has these advantages and more over the normal game. There is little chance of injury. I have fantasized a complete test match in little over twenty minutes. Cricket may be realer than real life, but never underestimate the power of imagination. In real life I am a deeply pedestrian right handed batsman, slow of reaction, limited of shot (forward defensive) and liable to get out for one. In the mirror I am a dashing left hander, not unlike David Gower, elegant and unflappable. Once the real cricket season starts, the unstoppable momentum of real life failure renders all such fantasies impossible. Only in March can you enjoy so vivid and productive a cricketing carrier. Only in March can you dream that you have taken 6 for 34 on the following morning of a Test against Australia, and then wake up deliriously happy at four o’clock in the morning, convinced for five or even six seconds that it actually happened. /
And you potter cheerfully about digging up rank smelling old kit from wherever you buried it for environmental reasons last September.
My own favorite ritual is the cleaning of the box, which has almost certainly lain untouched for months at the bottom of the miniature ecosystem otherwise known as my cricket bag. This small and undistinguished implement is going to protect my reproductive organs for the next five months, so it seems only fair to keep in good nick. Lovingly I soap it and rinse it, perhaps adding a layer of Pledge for that all weather shine. You can overdue it of course: one year I used so many different detergents and fluids on it that the damn thing started to melt.
