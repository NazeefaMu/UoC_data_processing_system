President orders speedy relief to the affected

President Maithripala Sirisena yesterday directed the relevant authorities to provide immediate relief to the people affected by the adverse weather conditions throughout the country.
The President said funding should not be considered a problem in this endeavour and as such the relevant authorities should find out the relief which should be given by the government and provide it without any delay.
A press release by the Presidents Media Unit said the President made this directive after reviewing the relief work in progress to assist affected people and seeking information from the relevant District Secretaries and Divisional Secretaries.
President Sirisena who has also directed that Armed Forces and Police assistance should be sought to evacuate people affected by floods, has informed all parties concerned about the need to provide uninterrupted relief and welfare measures to the affected people.
