The Girls’ category combined Gold and Silver Division saw a keen tussle to the very end between Taniya Minel Balasuriya and Kayla Perera. Locked together as joint leaders, both Taniya and Kayla were off to a great start in the final round birdieing the 1st hole! Kayla dropped a shot at the 2nd to give Taniya the lead, which Taniya maintained extending the lead to 2 strokes at the 9th hole. Taniya’s birdie on the 10th to Kayla’s double bogey established a 5-stroke lead.
Kayla showed tremendous resolve to fight back with a birdie on the 11th and par on the 12th to pull back 2 strokes. Taniya fired back with birdies on the 13th and 14th to lead by five strokes again. Kayla pulled back a stroke on the 15th when Taniya made a bogey and then finished with much grit making pars on 16th, 17th and birdieing the 18th hole, whilst Taniya made a double bogey on the 17th and just about held on to win by 2 strokes.
