World currencies have depreciated against US dollar - Governor

Though the Sri Lankan rupee depreciated against the US dollar by 2.9 per cent during the year, the Indian rupee has depreciated by 4.8% against the US dollar, Central Bank Governor Dr.Indrajit Coomaraswamy said.
Speaking at the launch of the annual report, he said the US dollar depreciated 4.4% in Philippines and 2.7% in Australia and 2.4% in Indonesia. He predicted that the market sources will soon step to lower it.
He also said there is a myth created that due to the depreciation on the dollar against the Sri Lankan rupee, the government would have to pay huge additional amounts when it comes to foreign debt settlements.
“This is not as we are paying foreign debt in US dollars and not in rupees.”
Central Bank Deputy Governor Dr. P. Nandalal Weerasinghe said these kind of misleading statements are being told by people who don’t understand economics and mathematics.(SS)
