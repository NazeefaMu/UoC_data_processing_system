Unbeaten Peterites host Kingswood today

Unbeaten St. Peter’s College Bambalapitiya will play host to Kingswood College Kandy in their second round Singer ‘A’ Division inter-schools league rugby match at Havelock Park today at 4.00pm.
The Peterites after their morale boosting win against Trinity College Kandy (28- 21) in Pallekelle have only two more hurdles to clear - Kingswood and St Joseph’s (next week) to get closer to the league title.
Their final match will be against the only other unbeaten side for the season Royal College which will be the decider.
If the Peterites manage to win all three games, they will be crowned as the unbeaten school’s league rugby champs for the year.
The Peterires are packed with some outstanding players in their ranks, who are match winners. But they should get their act together if they are to pull off their sixth consecutive win for the season against unpredictable Kingswood outfit.
St. Peter’s are coached by veteran rugby coach Sanath Martis.
Meanwhile Kingswood under the watchful eyes of their consultant coach Ronny Ibrahim, will know that losing their third consecutive game could also could mean a setback for them in the league tournament as they have lost to Isipathana College (5-10) in their last outing in Nittawela last week.
Hence they will come out with their best outfit for this game and will go out with all guns blazing to try and topple the Peterites.
