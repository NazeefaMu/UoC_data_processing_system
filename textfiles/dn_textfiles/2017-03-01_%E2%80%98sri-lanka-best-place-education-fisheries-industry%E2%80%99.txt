‘Sri Lanka, best place for education in fisheries industry’

Fisheries Minister of Seychelles Michael Benstrong said the Government of Seychelles expects to send its citizens in the fisheries industry to Sri Lanka for further studies.
He met Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayake at the Finance Ministry on February 28.
Minister Benstrong said the fishing industry in Sri Lanka is maintained at high standards and his country needs to develop the industry to such standards. He said he appreciated the assistance given by Sri Lanka to Seychelles in this regard.
The economy of Seychelles, an archipelago, is based on tourism and fisheries industry. It has a lot of models to be adopted from Sri Lanka, Minister Benstrong said.
