BOND COMMISSION C350 REPORT CD AVAILABLE NOW

The National Archives Department yesterday announced that Section C350 of the Bond Commission report, containing call records of COPE members and the Finance Minister, has been made available to the public.
National Archives Director General Nadeera Rupasinghe told the Daily News yesterday that one party has already taken a scanned copy of the document after paying scan charges and therefore others who wish to buy a copy need not pay the scanning charges.
“Those who wish to obtain a copy could buy it by paying only the CD charge of Rs 175,”the DG said. The Attorney General had informed the Secretary to the President to release section C350 of the Bond Commission report claiming that it will not impact the ongoing investigations on the Central Bank Treasury bond scam.
