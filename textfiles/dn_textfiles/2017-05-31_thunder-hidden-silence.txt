Thunder hidden in silence

Come, all of Humanity, Irrespective of cast, creed or religion, and awaken to taste Rumi's religion of love. The world is whirling to the beat of love. Learn the secrets of the whirling dervishes.
You who possess not Love, it is lawful to you-sleep on;
Be gone, for Love and Love's sorrow is our portion – sleep on.
We have become motes of the sun of sorrow for the Beloved;
You in whose heart this passion has never arisen, sleep on.
You who are not anguished by the question “Where is He?” – sleep on.
(Jalaluddin Rumi)
Have, the mesmerizing drumbeats of war, hatred and terror, of a fanatic fringe, that spares no border, entranced the rest of mankind into a languid stupor of apathy and fear?
Have, we forgotten God's joyous pronouncement:
“O Mankind, we created you from a single pair of a male and a female, and made you in to tribes and nations so that you may know each other (not that you despise each other). (Al-Quran, from Chapter 49, Verse 13).
Have these words been confined to scriptures?
I look upon all creatures equally; none are less dear to me and none more dear (Bhagavad Gita 9.29’).
‘There is a neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither slave nor free, there is neither male nor female, for you are all one in Christ Jesus'.
(Bible, Galatians 3.28) and;
‘So what of all these titles, names, and races? They are mere worldly conventions” (Buddhism. Sutta Nipata 648).
Is it not time for the silent masses, to wake up from their slumber to celebrate the joy of creation and reach out to God in love and ardour?
What better way to do so than to swirl in the whirlpool of Jalaluddin Rumi!
“At every instant and from every side, resounds the call of Love:
We are going to sky, who wants to come with us?
We have gone to heaven, we have been the friends of the angels, and now we will go back there, for there is our country.
We are higher than heaven, more noble that the angels:
Why not go beyond them? Our goal is the Supreme Majesty”
(The above verse is from the Sufi Poetry of Jalaludin Rumi)
Awaken Sri Lanka, as we will soon have amongst us, in our very own shores, the renowned Ahamed Dede Pattisahusiwa, teacher of the Whirling Dervish Meditation, who is one of the most devoted followers of Jalaluddin Rumi the great Sufi, Saint, Poet, Mystic and Scholar.
Ahmad Dede Pattisahusiwa, with eastern roots and a western upbringing (Indonesia and Netherlands respectively), presently leads the Haqqani-Mevlevi Suif Order. He has made it his life's mission to propagate the teaching of Jalaluddin Rumi. He travels the world, preaching the spirituality of love and conducting workshops in the art of meditation through whirling. Spreading Rumi's ‘Religion of Love’, he strives to repose in the hearts of the discerning seeker the secrets of meditation though whirling.
He is guided by Rumi's vision of love that transcends the bounds of cast, creed and colour:
“What can I do, Muslims? I do not know myself. I am neither Christian nor Jew, neither Magian nor Muslim,
I am not from east or west, not from land or sea, not from the shafts of nature nor from the spheres of the firmament,
Not of the earth, not of water, not of air, not of fire. I am not from the highest heaven, not from this world.
Not from existence, not from being. I am not from India, not from China, not from Bulgar, not from Saqsin,
Not from the realm of the two Iraqs, not from the land of Khurasan. I am not from the world, not from beyond, not from heaven and not from hell.
I am not from Adam, not from Eve, not from paradise and not from Ridwan.
My place is placeless, my trace is traceless, no body, no soul, I am from the soul of souls.
(The above verse is from the Sufi Poetry of Jalaluddin Rumi).
Whirling is not just a technique, whirling is not just a dance or simply a meditation. Whirling is learning about Love and connecting the heart with heavens. I reality, behind the ‘veil’ of whirling there is a spiritual opening. Whirling becomes a ‘door’ in the form of an active meditation that aims to help the Lord's servants to experience unity and annihilation so that only God's beauty manifests through them.
So:
“Come, come whoever you may be, come again,
And be you non believer, Magian or idolater, Come again,
For Ours is not a Dergah of despair!
Though you may have broken Your repentance a hundred times
Come Again and Again”
