Request to revoke order  to confiscate bank accounts: Court turns downs Dhanuna’s request

Colombo Fort Magistrate Lanka Jayaratne yesterday turned down a request by Dhanuna Tillekaratne to revoke an order made to confiscate bank accounts belonging to him in connection with the HiCorp case.
While refusing to issue an order, the magistrate observed that such a request should have been made by the accused within a year following the order of the Magistrate’s Court to confiscate the properties. On June 30, 2010, the Colombo Fort Magistrate ordered to confiscate Rs. 15 million and US $1251 deposited in seven bank accounts belonging to Dhanuna Tillekaratne.
On October 15, 2015, the Colombo High Court ordered to acquit and release Dhanuna Tillekaratne from the HiCorp case, on the basis that the prosecution has failed to prove the accused’s guilty beyond reasonable doubt.
Danuna Tillekaratne had been charged under the Public Property Act for aiding and abetting to cheat US$ 299,061.25 of public funds through the HiCorp Private Company Ltd by forwarding forged bid documents to the Army for certain supplies to the Defence Ministry 2007-2008 after convincing the Army to deposit the money, while appearing as an agent of the British Borneo Defence Company in Australia.
