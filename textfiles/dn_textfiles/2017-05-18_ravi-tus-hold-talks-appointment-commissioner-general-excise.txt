Ravi, TUs hold talks on appointment of Commissioner General of Excise

Trade Union representatives stated that an internal appointment, by promoting a senior officer to the position would benefit the government’s ongoing program that targeted increased tax revenue.
The trade union representatives pointed out senior administrative officers were appointed as Commissioner Generals of the Department of Excise on political whims during the last 20 years.

He said that Excise duty has been increased by 400% to Rs.138 billion today from Rs.39 billion in 2014 thereby making it a reality within the Excise Department as well.
The minister further said that the prime target of President Maithripala Sirisena and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe is to furthering that humble change.
