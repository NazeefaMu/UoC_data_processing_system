"The United National Party (UNP) is campaigning in Moneragala to win 10 local government institutions in the district," Public Administration and Management Minister Ranjith Madduma Bandara said.
He said the UNP would secure a victory over the other parties including the 'lotus bud', betel, and hand among others.
He was addressing a rally in Ethimale in Moneragala.
Minister Bandara said that during the previous regime, politicians made an environment for the haves to flourish. "For this reason, the people brought about a change three year ago. Now we are working to enhance the economy of the rural people," he said.
He said the Pradeshiya Sabha members during the previous regime worked for contracts. not for the people. "The villages were not developed because of this reason. Those who were in the lotus bud and the betel leaf engaged in corruption during the previous regime," he said.
"Since the UNP government's Gam Uda project, people of Monaragala have not received anything," Minister Bandara said "Neither Sumeada nor Vijayamuni Zoysa has done nothing to Monaragala. But during the last three years, the area developed," he said.
He said the government reduced the prices of goods, medicine, and increased Samurdhi benefit. "No government granted those relief. The paddy and the maze farmers get a considerable price for their crops.
The UNP government will win 10 local government institutions in the Moneragala district since people appreciate government's efforts," he said.
