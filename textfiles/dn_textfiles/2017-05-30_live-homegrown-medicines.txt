To live by homegrown medicines

The World Health Organization estimates that over two third of rural population of developing countries rely on traditional medicines, mostly plant drugs, for their primary health care needs. Also, modern pharmacopoeia contains over 25% drugs derived from plants and many others which are synthetic parallels built on prototype compounds isolated from plants.
If we take Sri Lanka, we find four systems of traditional medicine have been adopted: Ayurveda, Siddha, Unani and Deshiya Chikitsa. The Ayurveda and Deshiya Chikitsa systems use mainly plant and herbal preparations for the treatment of diseases - the former uses about 2,000 species, the latter about 500. The plants are used singly or as mixtures.
We also witness a rapid growth of interest in traditional medicine in Sri Lanka due to two major reasons: first, the interest shown by both rural and urban people in complementary medicine and secondly, the interest shown by both local and foreign pharmaceutical industry for their input requirements. At the same time, the overharvesting of medicinal plants to serve national and international markets, raise the need for new national policies which should integrate health, environmental and economic perspectives.
Therefore, investments are needed for the development of appropriate cultivation and harvesting strategies which will simultaneously meet the demand for locally available medicinal plants. Simultaneously, there must be immediate effort to ensure the conservation of diverse biological resources and the preservation and application of local cultural knowledge on the use of these resources.
Survey
This writer believes that any systematic conservation and harvesting of local medicinal plants should start from basics. First, we should have a clear understanding of both the supply issues and the factors driving the demand. We also should find out the extent of the current and future medicinal plant market. Without this basic knowledge, we cannot plan for both the conservation and sustainable use of the habitats of the medicinal plants.
In early 2014, a group of four Sri Lankan experts investigated the current situation of country’s medicinal plant industry by gathering up-to-date information on the types of raw materials required, their aggregate quantities, heavily used and rare materials, family wise distribution, challenges faced by stakeholders as well as other pertinent issues. Their report was issued under the caption – “A survey on medicinal materials used in traditional systems of medicine in Sri Lanka.”
The result of their report was very revealing. They listed a total of 302 plant species belonging to 95 families, dominated by Leguminosae family. Out of these, 46 species belonging to 35 families were used intensively. A large portion of herbal materials was of completely local origin (71.13%) while 26% were imported and the rest (2.87%) can be obtained by both routes. Leaves were the most highly used part of the plant (22.2%). High price, poor quality, insufficient or totally absence of continuous supply and adulteration were the main constraints faced by the stakeholders. The unavailability of systematic cultivation and processing protocols, incorrect identification, and lack of proper quality control methodologies were identified as major challenges of the industry.
Their conclusion was that the scenario of the medicinal material industry in Sri Lanka was bleak. The results clearly demonstrated the need to implement a national strategy to address the major challenges faced by different stakeholders.
One reason why the development of existing conservation systems has been hindered was due to the non-availability of up-to-date information on medicinal materials and other related issues. The writer believes that this information could be effectively incorporated for the formulation of a sustainable development strategy for this industry.
Constraints
While addressing the policy issues, there is a need to highlight various factors like constraints, traditional knowledge and indigenous uses, marketing and trade, patent, quality control/standards etc.
Our medicinal plants sector is facing many constraints:- (1) Rapid depletion of the resource-base, due to many reasons, mostly man inflicted (2) Impoverishment of rural people, (who are stewards of the resource base and the holders of traditional ecological and medical knowledge), due to inequitable marketing channels, (3) Inefficient, imperfect and opportunistic medicinal plant trade, (4) Exploitative and adulterated drugs supply situation, (5) Deficient toxicology studies and standard preparations to improve the quality, efficacy and effectiveness of the traditional drugs, (6) Unsustainable wild-harvesting. (7) Lack of coordination amongst various stakeholders, particularly, Ministries of Health, Agriculture, Environment, Forestry, Science and Technology, and also Provincial Governments, private traditional medicine sector, research institutes, NGOs etc.
Any National Policy should give serious thought to settle these basic issues.
Benefits
Given the present bleak situation, it is advisable for the Government to develop a strong commitment to develop a National Policy on Traditional Medicine and Regulation of Herbal Medicines. In fact, some time ago, a policy dialogue was initiated regarding medicinal plant conservation and statements of support for such a policy were forthcoming from many of the stakeholders in the sector, including the private companies which depend upon a continuous source of raw material supply.
This dialogue needs to be continued more vigorously so that with the joint support of governmental, non-governmental and private sector, the process of developing and enacting a national policy on medicinal plants can be completed.
In this writer’s opinion, any national policy for sustainable development of medicinal plants resource should aim to:- (a) Conserve medicinal plants in protected areas, herbal gardens, sacred groves, preserve plots and forest areas rich in medicinal plants, (b) Conserve through cultivation, Joint Forest Management, gene banks etc, (c) Develop medicinal plant conservation areas inside as well as outside protected areas, (d) Research and development efforts for developing agro-techniques, extension and dissemination of information on cultivation of super genotypes. (e) Establish linkages between farmers and pharmaceutical industries for promotion of organic and contract farming, (f) Formalise efficient marketing techniques by providing information and possible interventions at various levels. (g) Formalise systems to resolve the problems of exploitation.
Marketing
The policy should intensively cover the field of marketing. In the medicinal plant industry, the various actions needed include: setting up of a national level authority, responsive marketing cooperatives, organisation of formal market, dissemination of market information, creation of international market opportunity etc.
Quality Control/Standards
Another important factor is quality control and standards. This constitutes an area where policy should be very specific. A nationally recognised set of quality control standards should be developed for the preparation of traditional medicine. This step would pose serious challenges as traditional medicine often contains a number of constituent plants, unlike allopathic medicines.
Some of the unique aspects of traditional medicinal preparation that would need to be considered include specific means of identifying and collecting constituent plants, including seasons for collections and appropriate age of plants, ecological origins, cleanliness in processing and adherence to documented procedures in the ancient texts of relevance.
It is important to ensure that the plants used as medicines are not toxic in any way. This is therefore, one area in which modern technology can be of great service. In addition, standard preparations need to be developed to make quality efficacy and effectiveness of the traditional drugs.
Institutional framework
All these suggestions look nice on paper. But, in order to make them effective there should be a solid institutional framework. This writer firmly believes that we should have a separate Ministry to administer traditional medicine. In this aspect, we can learn a lesson from India.
India has a separate ministry called The Ministry of AYUSH to ensure the optimal development and propagation of Ayurveda, Yoga and Naturopathy, Unani, Siddha and Homoeopathy healthcare systems. It was formed in November 2014. The Ministry focuses its attention for development of Education and Research in all five healthcare systems.
The Ministry is in the process of drafting a new National Policy on AYUSH, incorporating National AYUSH Mission, bringing out Minimum Standard Requirements on Ayurveda, amendments in various Acts concerning AYUSH, enhancing quality of traditional medical education through Regulatory Bodies, provision of infrastructural facilities for drug industry to ensure safety and efficacy of AYUSH drugs etc.
Vacuum
Medicinal plants sector in Sri Lanka today is operating in policy vacuum. Immediate action is therefore needed to produce clearly defined policies to regulate medicinal plants conservation, cultivation, marketing and trade, exports, domestic drug production and coordination efforts and information.
While it is true that indigenous healing does not have all the answers that Western medical science is perceived to have, it is also true that Western medicine does not have all the answers for diseases found among Asian and African peoples.
Any National Policy, therefore, should focus on unlocking the indigenous knowledge imbedded in the practice of indigenous healing and on the interaction of the two medical systems (Western and indigenous) for the benefit of the people.
