“There is so much knowledge available, yet the need is to act and create fashion products which are green conscious and earth sensitive, everyone knows that the fashion industry has a negative impact on the environment, can Sri Lanka take the lead through the Responsible Fashion Movement and show the region how knowledge can be converted into green thinking solutions. My heart is to involve more and more students into this program.”
