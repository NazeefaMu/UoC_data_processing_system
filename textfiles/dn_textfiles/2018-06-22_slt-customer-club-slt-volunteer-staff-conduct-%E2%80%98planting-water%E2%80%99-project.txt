SLT Customer Club, SLT volunteer  staff conduct ‘Planting for  Water’ project

SLT Customer Club Ratnapura together with the SLT volunteer team has organized a mission, “Planting for Water”, which is a “reforestation project” conducted at Rakwana Palamkotte mountain range, bordering the world heritage Sinharaja rain forest.
This program was greatly supported and guided by the regional authorities from the Department of National Community Water Supply, Forest Department Sri Lanka and volunteers from the community living in the area.
A major challenge faced by villagers in the Rakwana Palamkotte area is the lack of suitable drinking water. This water shortage is directly linked to the deforestation that took place in the area many years ago. In fact, one of the most serious challenges that our country will have to face in the near future is the inadequacy of clean drinking water.
“I am proud to work with the SLT team from their Headquarters and Ratnapura branch office together with members of the SLT Customer Club Ratnapura for the protection and the future survival of the Sinharaja Rain Forest which is considered a World Heritage. We are glad that SLT has recognized the sense of urgency of protecting our environment and embarked on this truly noble endeavour. We hope that others also will support us for these types of worthy projects in the future as every citizen in Sri Lanka only stands to benefit from the protection of the environment.” said by Yehiya M. Iflar, President of the SLT Customer Club – Ratnapura.
Members of the SLT Customer Club – Ratnapura, the team of volunteers from Regional Telecom Office of Ratnapura and Corporate Relations Division of SLT with the support of the customers and people living in the area joined hands for this worthy cause in order to carry out reforestation in 5 acres of land in this area and contribute towards preserving our natural heritage for the future generations.
“Through this reforestation project, the team expects to help build a “protection buffer-zone”, between the World heritage site, Sinharaja Forest Reserve and connected mountain forests. Natural water resources are becoming highly endangered. So we all as citizens of this country, need to act fast on this critical issue.” Rohana Ellawala, General Manager (Corporate relations) of Sri Lanka Telecom expressing his views on this voluntary program said.
The ecosystems of the world heritage Sinharaja rain forest and connected mountain forests need to be protected and every citizen of Sri Lanka can be a part of it. It is important to understand that the Sinharaja rain forest is one of the most important forests in the world, and it has been recognized as such by the UN due to the diverse varieties of endemic and rare species of wildlife found at the rain forest.
