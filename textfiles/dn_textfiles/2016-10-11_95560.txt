SLC suspends financial grants to 9 clubs/associations

Nine clubs and associations who have defaulted in submitting their audit reports for the past year have been suspended from getting any financial grants by Sri Lanka Cricket.
The nine member clubs are: Baduraliya Cricket Club, Bloomfield Cricket and Athletic Club, Southern Province Cricket Association, Negombo Cricket Club, Matara District Cricket Association, Puttalam District Cricket Association, Kollupitiya Sports Club, Normads Sports Club and Peterson Lane Sports Club.
“From the month of January we have informed the clubs and associations to have their audit reports and to hold their AGM in time. They have not complied with our request and so we have to suspend funding them,” said SLC president Thilanga Sumathipala.
“We are not funding any money until they rectify their administration. But for the sake of cricket they will be allowed to play in SLC conducted tournaments. Until they get their accounts up and running and they submit the audit reports the SLC has decided not to grant them any money,” he said.
