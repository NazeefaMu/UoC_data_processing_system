Rohan Fernando to ‘blow’ at Bradby second leg

Rohan Fernando has been confirmed as the referee for the second leg of the Bradby Shield rugby encounter between Royal and Trinity to be played at the Royal College Complex on Saturday. Fernando (38) is widely regarded as one of the top referees today. He is attached to the Sri Lanka Air Force and played for the Air Force team. The chief guest at the second leg will be Royal College’s 1980 skipper S. Sujanthakumar who will present the Bradby Shield to the winning team. Under Sujanthakumar’s leadership Royal won both legs of the Bradby (7-3 and 16-6).
