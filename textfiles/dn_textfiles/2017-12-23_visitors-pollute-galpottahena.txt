Visitors pollute Galpottahena

Galpottahena wewa or Merekele tank that supplies water to nearly 200 acres of paddy fields in the Deheragoda and Paranagama villages about seven kms off the Eheliyagoda town has become a playground for mischief makers, villagers said.
Visitors who come here during holidays scatter empty beer cans, liquor bottles, lunch boxes, biscuit wrappers and other wastage along the banks.
As a result, aquatic life and the environment of the tank are in jeopardy, they said.
Surrounding of the tank boast a variety of wild flowers and birds including wild pigeons, horn bills and king fishers, they said.
