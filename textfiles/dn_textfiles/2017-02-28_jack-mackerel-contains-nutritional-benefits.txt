Jack Mackerel contains nutritional benefits

Gayan Caldera, Marketing Manager FMCG Cluster of Renuka Foods said, “Jack Mackerel contains nutritional benefits that makes it special. There is a higher content of Omega 3 fats in the oily meat found in Jack Mackerel.
Omega 3 is a type of polyunsaturated fat that offers great health benefits. Canned jack mackerel is the highest in omega-3 fats of all mackerel fish. One ounce of canned jack mackerel, drained, solids only, provides 385 mg of omega-3 fats. “
Omega-3 fats benefit the heart of both healthy as well as those at high risk of—or who have—heart disease, according to the American Heart Association. It is true that all fish contain some omega-3 fatty acids, but varieties such as Jack Mackerel are particularly rich sources. Jack Mackerel is less expensive than salmon that also contains Omega 3 fats. So therefore the preferred choice in Sri Lanka is Captain Jack Mackerel.
COO of FMCG Cluster of Renuka Foods, Dinesh Nalliah commented “as a company marketing Jack Mackerel we take pride in offering housewives in Sri Lanka a popular choice of fish that is both healthy and delicious, which young families readily enjoy.” Jack Mackerel has been the most important commercial fish in the world for the past 50 years because it is considered to be better than other Mackerel. Its texture, chunkiness and higher nutritional value has greater appeal among housewives
The versatility of Jack Mackerel is greatly appreciated by Sri Lankan housewives who find it enormously convenient when preparing curries and short-eats, especially Sri Lanka’s party favourite cutlets.
