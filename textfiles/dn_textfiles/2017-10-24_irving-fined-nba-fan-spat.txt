Irving fined for NBA fan spat

New York: Kyrie Irving is off to a rocky start with the Boston Celtics after the league slapped the point guard with a $25,000 fine on Sunday for verbally abusing a Philadelphia 76ers fan.The exchange took place at halftime of the Celtics 102-92 win on Friday over the 76ers when a fan made a reference to Irving's former teammate LeBron James as the teams were heading to the locker rooms at the Wells Fargo Center arena. "Boston Celtics guard Kyrie Irving has been fined $25,000 for using inappropriate language when responding to a fan," league vice president Kiki VanDeWeghe said in a statement.
The Celtics aquired Irving in an offseason move after he demanded a trade from the NBA finals runner-up Cleveland Cavaliers. It is the second time in as many days the NBA has fined one of its players for an incident with a fan. On Saturday VanDeWeghe announced that DeMarcus Cousins had been fined $25,000 after the New Orleans Pelican player got into a heated exchange with a female fan during a game in Memphis. AFP
