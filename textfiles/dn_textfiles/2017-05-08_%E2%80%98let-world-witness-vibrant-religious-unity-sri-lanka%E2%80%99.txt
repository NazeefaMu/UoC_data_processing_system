‘Let the world witness vibrant religious unity in Sri Lanka’

The UN sponsored International Vesak Day in Sri Lanka from May 12 to 14, gives all Sri Lankans a wonderful opportunity to show the world the existence of live and vibrant religious unity in the country, Ven. Yatimalagala Sumanasara Thera said.
Executive Director of the Pattivila Dhamma Voice International Buddhist Centre,( (Dhaham Handa) and Help International, Adviser to the Qing Liang Temple, Singapore and Executive Director of the South East Asian Buddhist Forum (SEABFO), the Thera said in a message congratulating those behind the scene that the event including the World Buddhist Conference on the theme “Buddhist Teachings Show the Path to Social Justice and Sustainable World Peace,” during the International Vesak Day celebration in Sri Lanka opens new vistas to Sri Lanka and gives the world humanity to grasp the spirit of the teachings of the Buddha to a world struggling to live in peace and harmony.
“Let this UN sponsored Vesak Day be a show of gratitude of the World Buddhists Fraternity towards the late Sri Lanka Foreign Affairs Minister Lakshman Kadirgamar by recalling the pioneering role played by him in making a dream come true, by the proposal he made way back in 1999, and letting the United Nation declared the Vesak Poya Day an international holiday of great religious significance, the message said.
The message also highlights what the late Sri Lanka Foreign Affairs Minister Lakshman Kadirgamar had said tabling the proposal at the UNGA in September 1999: ‘It would be fitting to recall the immense contribution to the understanding of the human condition that the teachings of the Buddha made 2,500 ago and that it would be appropriate to honour the Buddha by declaring that Vesak, the sacred day for Buddhists the world over, be observed as a special day by the United Nations’.
“We are glad over the opportunity Sri Lanka has got to host the UN sponsored Vesak Day this year as the country that proposed ‘let the Vesak Day be a international day of observance’ almost 13 years after the first UN sponsored Vesak Day held in 2004 in the country,” the message added.
