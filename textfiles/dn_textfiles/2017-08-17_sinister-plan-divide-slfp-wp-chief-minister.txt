Sinister plan to divide SLFP - WP Chief Minister

The main intention behind bringing former first lady and her two sons before the FCID, CID is to divide the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP), Western Province Chief Minister Isura Devapriya said.
Addressing a press conference held at the Shravasthi in Colombo yesterday, he said efforts are being made to divide the SLFP using the issues faced by the Rajapaksa family."Basil Rajapaksa still thinks that he is the current Economic Development Minister and acts like one. It was the UNP which promised people good governance in January 2015, but now it is the SLFP not the UNP that practices it," Devapriya said.
According to the Chief Minister, Buddhasasana and Justice Minister Wijeyedasa Rajapakshe is being criticised because he speaks and acts straight and he did during the previous regime. The Chief Minister said President Maithripala Sirisena can work till 2021.He is people's President and he will fulfil people's wishes. He is clearly practicing good governance.The people have received benefits through this National Government, he added.
