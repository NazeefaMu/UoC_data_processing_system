Hilton's annual Thrive Sabbatical 2019 winners announced

Hilton has announced the ten global winners selected for its annual Thrive Sabbatical 2019. The program awards each winner an all-expenses paid four-week sabbatical to pursue a cause that is closest to their hearts; a stipend of US$ 5,000 and a travel camera to document their memories.
This year, Hilton announces two winners from the Asia Pacific region, both hailing from South East Asia: Hilton Garden Inn Singapore Serangoon’s Angel Hu and Hilton Colombo Residences’ Minoli Senanayake.
Paul Hutton, vice president, operations for Hilton in South East Asia said, “In 2018, Hilton was recognized as the Best Multinational Workplace in Asia, and a Great Place to Work in nine countries including India, Saudi Arabia, the United Kingdom and the United States. We are constantly looking for the best ways to provide our Team Members with meaningful opportunities that will allow them to live their best every day and the Thrive Sabbatical program enables 10 of them each year to grow and flourish as individuals as we provide the resources and time they need to fulfil what might be a lifelong dream.”
