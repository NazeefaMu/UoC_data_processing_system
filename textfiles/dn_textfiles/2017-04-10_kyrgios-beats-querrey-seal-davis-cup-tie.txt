Kyrgios beats Querrey to seal Davis Cup tie

BRISBANE AFP April9, 2017 : Nick Kyrgios sent Australia into the Davis Cup semi-finals when he beat American Sam Querrey in the first of the reverse singles in Brisbane on Sunday.
Kyrgios's 7-6 (7/4), 6-3, 6-4 win gave the Australians an unassailable 3-1 lead over the US.
Kyrgios and Jordan Thompson put Australia in the box seat when they won the opening singles on Friday.
The Americans hit back in the doubles on Saturday but Kyrgios, who has been in superb form this week, was too good for Querrey and wrapped up the match in two hours, five minutes.
The manner of the victory will go a long way to winning over an Australian sporting public who have grown tired of the world number 16's on-court behaviour.
His past was all but forgotten by the packed crowd at Pat Rafter Arena, who chanted his name as he ran to captain Lleyton Hewitt and carried him around the court in delight.
Australia will now play either Belgium away or Italy at home in September's semi-finals.
Belgium lead Italy 2-1 in their quarter-final in Charleroi.
