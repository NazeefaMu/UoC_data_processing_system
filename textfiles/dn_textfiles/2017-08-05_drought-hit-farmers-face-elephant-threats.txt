Drought-hit farmers face elephant threats

Farmer organization representatives complain that farmers in difficulty due the prevailing drought have to face threats from wild elephants who invade villages in search of food and water.
Farmers in Kahatagollewa and Ihala Puliyankulama in Kebithigollewa DS Division had complained to President Maithripala Sirisena as well when he toured the area recently. They had told him that the electrified fences recommended to be constructed in their villages are not erected yet.
The setting up of an electrified fence of about 850 km covering 22 Divisional Secretaries in Anuradhapura had been stalled. Proposals submitted to the Anuradhapura government agent have been forwarded to wildlife conservation authorities for further action.
When inquired from wildlife officials, they said that a majority of proposals by Divisional Secretaries on electrified fences were lacking vital information. Also, the proposed tracks for fences were either blocking elephant corridors or the distance is extravagant. Under these circumstances, the proposals are to be revised which takes time, they pointed out.
Anuradhapura government agent R. M. Wanninayaka said on the directions of the President, he would discuss with Divisional Secretaries and wildlife conservation officials immediately to implement the electric fence project on a priority basis.
