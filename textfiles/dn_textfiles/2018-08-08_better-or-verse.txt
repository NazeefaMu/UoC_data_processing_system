For better or verse

Engineering and penning poetry, prose and other creative works may not go hand in hand but young scribe and engineer Tharindu Weerasinghe manages to include both in his life. The 34-year-old past pupil of Maliyadeva College, Kurunegala, and Peradeniya University has produced a collection of articles in two books: one in Sinhala and one in English titled ‘Mata Penena Hati’ and ‘Life, As I See It!’
Speaking about what inspired him to write the collections Thartindu says, “I look at life from different perspectives and I identify the aspects of living in black, white and grey shades. I believe and follow the teachings in Buddhism. This motivated me to write about life from my perspective. It includes tips to improve the quality of laymen life.”
He says that no sooner had he written the articles, he felt the need to share them with others through print. He contacted local newspapers and sent his work to be published. His writings have been carried in many Sinhala and English newspapers.
“It was satisfying seeing my ideas in print and read by many. That kind of lease cannot be purchased through money. After 15 years I went through my work once again and thought of bringing them forth in two books,” he said.
Tharindu is the Head of Operations at Seebo Networks Lanka. He says that he thinks of himself as a ‘time-waster’. Therefore he tries to make the maximum use of it by engaging in meaningful deeds.
“There is a saying that "if you want something to get done - then give it to a busy person". That means an occupied, organised person can always find some time for everything. I am not very good in that sense but I think I have done some worthwhile things apart from my professional work,” Tharindu expressed. He has touched topics like human behaviour, cultural degradation, technical development, emotional development etc in his writing.
Speaking about another pet project of his – writing poetry – Tharindu says that he can dub himself as a ‘small-scale lyricist’.
“I am still a beginner. I have written a few songs during my university days and when I moved to Colombo. Whenever I get an idea and am in a creative mood, I let my pen flow. Writing poetry has never been for monetary gains. It is a passion I enjoy indulging in,” Tharindu explained adding that his lyrics are available on http://www.tharinduweerasinghe.com/the-lyricist and see my songs for anyone to read.
“we cannot influence to make people good overnight. But the least we can do is share our experience and let them shine better than us. This gives a sense of satisfaction to me. I am not saying that I am a perfect person. But I believe that if I could influence someone through my writing then it will be less suffering for mother Lanka,” he said adding that he had gotten positive feedback to his articles and some have even requested to read more of his work.
Speaking about his vision for the future Tharindu says that Sri Lanka has a great potential to become a knowledge hub because Sri Lankans are smart.
“National policies need to be implemented. Moving forward should not boil down to government policies. A country should move forward even though governments change. We need to protect our identity and culture as well as our environment and develop. As professionals, we need to give our maximum in building up the nation. You need to have the correct mindset first to make a big change,” he opined.
Tharindu has two Masters Degrees, a Charter in Engineering, Bachelors in Engineering. He has penned five books up to now. His latest books ‘Mata Penena Hati’ and ‘Life, As I See It!’ are dedicated to his six-year-old daughter. They are available at Sarasavi Bookshop.
