Ajith pledges to bring justice to victimised UNPers

The main reason for the three-year delay in meting out justice to UNPers subjected to political victimisation during the previous regime was that certain members of committees appointed at ministerial level to submit recommendations were either the very perpetrators of such victimisation or those who catered to the needs of people responsible for such acts of victimisation, UNP Trade Union Secretary and Power and Renewable Energy State Minister Ajith P Perera said.
The State Minister said in his capacity as the Ombudsman of the UNP-oriented Jathika Sevaka Sangamaya, he would take steps to bring justice to victimised UNPers after holding discussions at trade union level.
The State Minister who assumed duties as the UNP Trade Union Secretary yesterday, said he called on Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe the previous night and informed him about the assumption of his new post and sought instructions about the new duties vested in him.
He said the Prime Minister advised him to coordinate party trade union activities. He said he in turn pledged to perform the vital responsibilities cast on him by the new post in an efficient manner.
State Minister Perera who added that he would hold discussions with the party trade unions to ascertain the political injustices caused to them, said he would take action to correct them, in close collaboration with UNP General Secretary and Minister Akila Viraj Kariyawasam and Parliamentarian Sirinal de Mel. Earlier State Minister Ajith P. Perera visited the Jathika Sevaka Sangamaya headquarters at Pita Kotte and assumed duties as UNP Trade Union Secretary after receiving his appointment letter from UNP Parliamentarian Sirinal de Mel. JSS Media Secretary Sunil de Silva made the welcome speech.
Other UNP trade union representatives were also present in the occasion.
