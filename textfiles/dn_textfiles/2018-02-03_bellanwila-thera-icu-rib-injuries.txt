Bellanwila Thera in ICU with rib injuries

Venerable Prof. Bellanwila Wimalarathana Thera has been admitted to the Kalubowila hospital's Intensive Care Unit following fractures to his ribs sustained in a fall.
The Thera had gone to feed a baby elephant at the Bellanwila Temple named Milan Kumar this morning, and had tripped and fallen while returning back.
A source close to the monk told the Daily News that there was no serious threat to the thera’s life, but he was expected to undergo surgery last night. He said the monk’s condition was stable.
