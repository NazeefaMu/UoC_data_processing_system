Hopeful world of disaster

We have come a long way in the subject area of narratology. Over the years, the creative writers have been engaged in the art of expression as well as the extent to which the contents should be waylaid as human experiences, worthy of expression.
At a period in history where technology and the impact of it on the globalisation is felt both as necessities as well as evil forces, the creative writers have enjoyed the freedom of expression superseding the past narrative forms.
The modern Sinhala narrative writer has accepted these social changes to the point that there arise various controversies as well as tributes paid to them. One such example is the award-winning Sinhala novel by Katyana Amarasinghe titled as Vanna Dasi (Suriya 2017).
Moralities undermined
The narrative embraces almost all the aspects of complexities of the modern human. It if is to be translated well, I am sure it will win the hearts of many a reader around the globe. Katyana, a fiction writer, does not undermine the moralities of the social sphere in her narrative when she creates the character of Ama, the protagonist who narrates the experiences of herself and her mother. She presents the portrait of her mother as a sex worker disclaiming her as a whore.
Ama’s mother, though is the pivotal character in the work, Ama too faces the same situation as she traverses the struggle to exist as a skilled painter, designer and above all a beautician commending off from being a makeup artist attached to a commercial tv channel surrounded by all the nuances of the so-called popular visual culture. The pomp and pageantry repel her.
This happens as a result of her intimacies with another skilled young man named Sasha. Both of them who leave the popular TV channel attempt to build their own salon that excels both in value and attraction.
They build their business knowing each other as humans and not as business dealers. The narrative explores the nature of Sasha’s behaviour as a homosexual not so much clamouring for the same. Katyana, the creator does not make a sensation issue out of the subject. Instead allows the reader to justify what it means by living as co-partners in a well-planned business deal, while the business flourishes the overwhelming calamities arises from the antagonists as well as jealous folks who so desire to bring about destructions.
Destructible enemies
The evil forces of the world built by Ama and Sasha react to the climax when hidden political forces to emerge as destructible enemies. Their business firm is ultimately burnt down to ashes before their own eyes.
Then all these disasters are followed by the advent of a suggestive saviour of the souls. He is named as Malan, a friend who comes from abroad with all the qualifications of changing the existing social forces. Malan who perceives the ins and outs of the social situation are seen as the liberator who carves out a new political party.
This helps both Ama and Sasha to attract themselves to him closer and closer. The trio, Ama, Sasaha and Malan are seen attempting to b build a new world. This is a narrative which spans over a period of roughly 20 years or so.
Perhaps the reader of my calibre may be seen as feeling a sense of puzzle to what the socio ideology of Malan that could change the existing pattern of evil forces. This may look perhaps a construction and conflict of ideas born in the mind. But then all is said ‘Vanna Dasi’ the page-moving resourceful narrative embracing spiritualism as a thread in the content.
Katyana Amarasinghe attempts to show the world of Ama, makeup artist cum designer through packed with disaster is yet hopeful of betterment. The term Vannadasi is symbolic as it is alluded to the facial makeup female servant who had lived in the harems of ancient kings thus suggestive of a facelift for the entire calamitous world of humans.
