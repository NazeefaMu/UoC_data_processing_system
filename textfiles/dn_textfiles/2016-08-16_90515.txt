Thrilling murder mystery in ‘Rustom’

Akshay Kumar has already played an Indian intelligence officer (Baby), Armyman (Holiday: A Soldier is Never Off-Duty) and a patriotic do-gooder minus a designation (Airlift, Gabbar etc.). With ‘Rustom’, the Bollywood star is back as a Decorated Officer and Devoted Family Man.
‘Rustom’ will have all the trappings to provide you with an edge-of-the-seat thriller. While the movie is being billed as a romantic one, it also provides a twist to the tale with a thrilling murder mystery to keep the audience riveted and puzzled with interesting twists and turns.
Rustom’ is imported by Ceylon Theatres and is screening at Majestic Cineplex 10.30 am, 1.30 pm, 4.30 pm, 7.30 pm Fri/Sat 10.30 pm.
