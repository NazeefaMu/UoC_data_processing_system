Organs airlifted to save three lives

Prompt action taken by Health Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne saved three lives when three patients quickly received the organs they required, a Health Ministry spokesman said.
According to the spokesman, a 35-year-old youth was admitted to the Polonnaruwa General Hospital for treatment for internal bleeding in the head.
The youth had fallen into a brain dead condition. His liver and two kidneys were transplanted to three other patients.
The organs were transplanted at the Colombo General Hospital and Kandy General Hospital after airlifting them to Colombo and Kandy with the assistance of Air Force aircraft. The organs were transported by a team of consultant doctors.
A 56-year-old patient received the liver and is now being treated at the Colombo General Hospital Intensive Care Unit while two other patients warded at the Kandy General Hospital received the two kidneys, the spokesman said.
After a quick discussion with the Air Force Commander, Health Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne made arrangements to send an aircraft to Polonnaruwa to airlift the organs and the team of doctors.
Minister Senaratne stated that organs will be airlifted in future whenever required, he added.
