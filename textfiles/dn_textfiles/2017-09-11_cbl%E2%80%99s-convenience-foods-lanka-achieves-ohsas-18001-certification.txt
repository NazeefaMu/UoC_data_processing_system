OHSAS 18001 is the International Occupational Health and Safety (OH&S) Management Standard. It provides a framework for the effective management of OH&S including all aspects of risk management and legal compliance.
The most important aspect of an OHSAS 18001 OH&S management system is the requirement to identify workplace hazards that could adversely impact the health and safety of the organization’s employees and of other people who may be affected by the organization’s activities.
