Which records got shattered in 2018 FIFA World Cup?

The 2018 FIFA World Cup is almost nearing its climax.
With just 6 more games left, before the final, the excitement is surely heating up.
Several records have been broken in this edition of the tournament including the longest start without a goalless draw which came in the 37th game.
Here we take a look at the records that were shattered in this edition.
MOST PENALTY GOALS IN A SINGLE WORLD CUP 21 GOALS
The introduction of the controversial technology 'Video Assistant Referee' has seen the increase in the number of penalty goals scored in this edition of the World Cup.
In the 2014 FIFA World Cup, in Brazil, 13 penalties were awarded.
However, this time around, in first 56 matches that have been played so far, a total of 21 goals have been scored via penalties.
FIRST MANAGER TO APPEAR IN FOUR EDITIONS WITH SAME TEAM OSCAR TABAREZ
Uruguay boss Oscar Tabarez created his own piece of history by becoming the first manager to appear in four World Cups with the same team.
The 2018 edition in Russia is Tabarez's fourth as the manager of Uruguay and third consecutive tournament.
The 71-year-old master tactician is also the oldest manager at the 2018 FIFA World Cup.
OLDEST PLAYER IN A WORLD CUP GAME ESSAM EL-HADARY
At 45 years and 161 days, Egypt's goal-keeper Essam El-Hadary became the oldest player to feature in a World Cup fixture when he took the field against Saudi Arabia. This is also his debut tournament.
He broke the record, which was earlier held by 43-year-old Colombian custodian Faryd Mondragon.
Faryd had achieved this feat during the 2014 FIFA World Cup.
OLDEST PLAYER TO SCORE A HAT-TRICK CRISTIANO RONALDO
Cristiano Ronaldo made sure he etched his name in the history books when he scored a hat-trick in Portugal's opener against Spain.
Ronaldo's feat ensured he became the oldest player to score 3 goals in a single game, at the premier tournament. He achieved the feat aged 33 years and 131 days breaking Rob Rensenbrink record of 30 years and 336 days.
