Proposed new Constitution: Interim Report of Steering Committee Negated JO's Propaganda

The Interim Report of the Steering Committee which was presented to Parliament has defeated many of the false propaganda spread by the Joint Opposition (JO), National Co-existence, Dialogue and Official Languages Mano Ganesan said. He said the report had disproved claims that Buddhism would lose its prominence,
that a Federal government would be created and that the North and East would be merged.
“The new Constitution is not Federal, the place granted to Buddhism has been secured and the North and East will not be merged.
Such matters have been clearly explained in the Interim Report and the JO will now have to weave new lies in future”, said the minister. The Minister was speaking at a function at Pushpadana hall in Kandy on Sunday (24). He said that the JO which engaged in politics through the spread of racism and religious conflict will now have to find a new topic to harp on.
Ganesan further said that though the majority of lawyers in the country were law abiding and act in the best interest of the country, there were among them certain corrupt individuals, like in any other profession.
Thus, he said, it was up to the lawyers to identify the corrupt and those who protect the corrupt and remove them from the legal profession.
