U.S.-South Korea quarrel over trade

U.S. Commerce Ministry announced plans last week to impose high import tariffs, as high as 53 percent, on steel and aluminum products from countries, including South Korea.
Earlier, the U.S. administration decided on January 23 to slap safeguards against washing machines and solar cell imports from countries, including South Korea, by levying high import tariffs on them.
Meanwhile, the bilateral US-South Korea FTA, which took effect in 2012, has been under negotiations to amend as U.S. President Donald Trump called it a “horrible” deal.
Last Monday South Korean President Moon Jae-in on Monday ordered resolute measures against U.S. protectionist moves in bilateral trade, taking a two-track approach to the trade issue by separating it from security issues.
“Regarding unfair trade protectionist actions, (the government) should take confident and resolute measures, such as the filing (of a complaint) with the World Trade Organization (WTO) and the review over whether (the U.S. action) violates the (South) Korea-U.S. free trade agreement (FTA),” Moon said.
He also instructed officials to actively point out the unfairness of the U.S. safeguards against South Korean products in negotiations with the United States to revise the South Korea-U.S. free trade pact.
President Trump also hinted at a two-track approach to trade and security issues, saying last week that he will push for a “reciprocal tax” on countries, including its allies such as South Korea. Trump said the so-called allies were not allies on trade.
During the meeting with his senior aides, Moon stressed the importance of the diversification of his country's trade partners to reduce dependence on the United States in trade.
Moon told his aides that the U.S. import restrictions on South Korean exports, including steel, electronics, solar cell and washing machines were feared to disrupt the country's export that has an international competitiveness.
South Korea's export expanded 15.8 percent in 2017, marking the fastest export growth among the world's top 10 exporting countries. The country's export ranking was raised by two notches to the sixth in the world last year.
Moon ordered a close review and a comprehensive policy package to tackle the recent moves that affect the export of South Korea, while rapidly pushing for innovative growth to improve the country's export competitiveness.
DAVOS calls for reform of market capitalism
Last year’s Global Risks Report published by the DAVOS World Economic Forum has called for “fundamental reforms to market capitalism” and a rebuilding of solidarity within and between countries.
The Report says environmental risks have grown in prominence in recent years, with all five risks in the environmental category being ranked higher than average for both likelihood and impact over a 10-year horizon. Characteristics of the preceding year were high-impact hurricanes, extreme temperatures and the first rise in CO2 emissions. It also said that “biodiversity is being lost at mass-extinction rates, agricultural systems are under strain and pollution of the air and sea has become an increasingly pressing threat to human health.” The situation was worsened by unilateral action of some states which shunned away from multi-national initiatives.
The Report also notes the alarming increase of cyber security threats in which the targets were businesses as well as critical infrastructure and strategic industries.
Geopolitically the world has become more unstable with multi-lateral rule-based approaches deteriorating resulting in military tensions, economic and commercial disruptions, the Report notes with concern.
Elaborating further the Report clarifies, thus: “Four related developments stand out as potential sources of disruption over the short and medium term. The intensification of strong-state politics is affecting both large and small states, while global norms are eroding and tensions growing between major powers. These two trends fuel two others: increasingly aggressive geo-economic agendas and the mounting pressures faced by small states.”
Refugees defy death seeking greener pastures
A total of 2,583 migrants and refugees have reached Europe by the sea so far in 2018, according to the UN's International Organization for Migration (IOM).
In mid-January, the crew of the Dutch NGO boat, Sea Watch 3, saved 165 people on board a rubber vessel north Libya.
Most refugees, who had fled Libya, were trying to reach European shores. They included eight children and 28 women, three of whom were pregnant.
An Italian rescue mission Sea Watch 3 had saved more than 400 people from possible death by drowning or cold.
Tens of thousands of people from Africa and the Middle East leave the Libyan coast for Europe dangerously traversing the Mediterranean Sea defying death.
Reportedly 199 people died attempting to cross the Mediterranean between January 1 and January 17.
Less than half the arrivals, or 1,093 people, were registered in Italy, 847 in Greece and 653 in Spain.
