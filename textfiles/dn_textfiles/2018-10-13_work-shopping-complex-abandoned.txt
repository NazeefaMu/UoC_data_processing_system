Work on shopping complex abandoned

The construction work of two storey shopping complex at Agunakolapelessa has been abandoned and many illegal activities are taking place at the location now, residents of the area complained.
They said the work commenced several years ago by the Urban Development Authority.
Agunakolapelessa Pradesheeya Sabha Chairman Gamini Weerabaddana said market is inundated even after a a shower.
He said the UDA set up the shopping complex on a land suitable for a bus stand. Now the residents have neither a bus stand nor a shopping complex, he said.
