National govt. should have been formed in 2009: Devapriya

A national government should have been formed immediately after the war in 2009. But, the former leader did not do this. It if was done, Sri Lanka would have gone much forward today, Western Province Chief Minister Isura Devapriya said.
The Chief Minister was addressing a workshop organised by the Information Department in collaboration with the Western Provincial Council and the Institute for Constitutional Studies to educate senior state officials in the Western Province on the implementation of the Right to Information (RTI) Bill yesterday. The RTI which was ratified into law by the Speaker yesterday, was one of the main pledges of the Yahapalana government, Devapriya said.
He said the right to information is often described as the fourth basic right of the people.
"Today, we have been able to reaffirm this right and the people can now obtain the information they require from all government institutions," he said.
"There are certain people in the Opposition engaged in useless frolics which have no benefits and importance to the people. But they have forgotten that they cannot topple this government until 2020 by force," Devapriya said.
The Chief Minister said due to these childish activities, Sri Lanka will be stagnant without going forward.
Devapriya said since non of the two major political parties got a clear majority at previous elections, they could not bring any useful legislation such as the RTI.
"We will be able to pass such important Bills in the future to ensure the people's rights further,” he added.
Government Information Department Director General Dr. Ranga Kalansooriya said the main purpose of the Bill is to provide for the Right of Access to Information, to specify grounds on which access may be denied, to establish the Right to Information commission, to appoint Information Officers and to set out the procedure and for matters connected with it.
It is expected to foster a culture of transparency and accountability in public authorities by giving effect to the right of access to information and thereby promote a society in which the people would be able to more fully participate in public life through combating corruption and promoting accountability and good governance, he said.
He said that plans are afoot to educate senior state officials on the implementation of this Bill in Provincial level in due course.
Dr. Kalansooriya said with the implementation of the RTI, state offices are under obligation to provide information as soon as they get requests from the public.
It will take at least six months to implement the RTI and there should be an early preparedness by training information officers in every Department, he said.
"There should also be an information service such as management service and accountancy service. Although we were the last in South Asia to bring in the RTI legislation, ours has been recognised as the seventh best RTI law in the world," he added.
