Honduras elections: Controversial results spark mass protests

With no official results of last Sunday’s Presidential election being announced even by yesterday controversy over the winner has made Opposition supporters take to the streets in a mass protest alleging vote rigging and computer glitches.
Though President Juan Orlando Hernandez of the ruling National Party claimed victory, the first result of the Supreme Electoral Tribunal (TSE) of Honduras released Thursday (27) stated that the presidential candidate of the Opposition Alliance, Salvador Nasralla, is ahead by almost five points.
Judge David Matamoros said that Nasralla adds 855,847 votes, representing 45.17 percent, with 57 percent of the polling stations counted. Hernandez, on the other hand, accumulates 761,872 votes, equivalent to 40.21 percent of the tables, he added.
However, 36 hours later the tribunal’s latest tally showed that with 92.62 percent of ballots counted, the center-right Hernandez had secured 42.92 percent of the vote, with Nasralla on 41.43 percent.
Although the Constitution of Honduras prohibits an incumbent President to run for office for a Second term, a controversial Court ruling which said that clause violates the fundamental rights of the President allowed Hernandez to contest the Presidency again. He came to power after elections held following a Washington inspired military coup against elected President Manuel Zelaya in 2009. He was accused of being a dictator.
On November 25th The Economist published an article suggesting that Honduras’s ruling party may have had plans to distort the results of a general election to be held the next day. It presented excerpts and transcripts from a tape of what appears to be a training session for National Party poll workers, on which the article was based.
In addition to the presidency of the country, Hondurans voted for some 3,000 public offices, including the 128 deputies to the National Congress and 20 to the Central American Parliament, as well as the municipal councils of 298 mayoralties.
Columbian Congress approves peace accord
Columbian Congress approved a revised peace accord with the FARC rebel group on Wednesday night, a vote that was most likely the final hurdle in ratifying the troubled agreement whose earlier version had been rejected in a referendum earlier on October 2.
Both the Senate and House of Representatives, controlled by President Juan Manuel Santos’s governing coalition, voted overwhelmingly for the agreement. But congressional opponents of the deal had walked out of the chamber in protest before the vote took place.
After years of talks in Havana, rebel and government negotiators announced in August they had reached a deal to end a half century of war which left more than 200,000 people dead. The next month, the rebels arrived to the port city of Cartagena, where the signing ceremony was held before world leaders and televised to the nation.
The agreement also guarantees former rebels representation in Congress, but it bans them from running in newly created districts in former conflict zones.
The two sides have said in coming weeks the rebels will leave their camps, relocating to a set number of sites throughout the country.
Brexit financial deal nearly completed
Reports from Britain confirm that the British Government has offered an improved financial compensation package to the European Union which would perhaps find approval at the next round of Brexit negotiations between British Prime Minister Theresa May and European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker scheduled for December 4.
The BBC, The Financial Times, The Guardian and several other British newspapers and media outlets are reporting that following a UK government Cabinet meeting last week, the British significantly upped their offer to Brussels, coming much closer than they previously had to the EU’s estimate of the UK’s financial obligations.
When May and Juncker meet in five days’ time, all three of the big issues will be on the table, namely: the ‘divorce bill’, EU citizens’ rights and the border between Ireland and Northern Ireland.
If the EU’s chief negotiator Michel Barnier is satisfied that sufficient progress to have been made on all three issues talks may progress the Brexit talks into the next stage, with the final decision on that to be made at a European council meeting of the bloc’s leaders on December 14 and 15.
As the Irish Government is unhappy with the way the British Government has handled the border issue it may use its veto further stalling the negotiations.
China proposes three-stage solution to Rohingyan issue
Xinhua news agency reported that Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi has proposed a three-stage solution to help resolve the Rakhine, Myanmar issue.
“China believes that the Rakhine issue can be addressed with an acceptable solution for both Myanmar and Bangladesh through consultations between the two neighbouring countries”, Wang said at a press conference with the State Councillor and Myanmar’s Foreign Minister, Aung San Suu Kyi.
The international community and the UN Security Council should encourage such efforts by creating conditions and a good atmosphere for consultations, he added.
The Chinese proposal envisages, first, to reach a ceasefire so that local residents are no longer displaced.
Second, the international community should encourage Myanmar and Bangladesh to maintain communication to find a viable solution to the issue. The two countries reached an initial agreement to repatriate refugees who fled Myanmar to Bangladesh.
The third stage is to find a long-term solution. The Chinese minister stressed that poverty is the root cause of the conflict and called on the international community to support poverty alleviation efforts in Rakhine, Myanmar.
