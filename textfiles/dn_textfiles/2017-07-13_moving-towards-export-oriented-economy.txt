Moving towards export-oriented economy

Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe, recently said that the Government plans to create an export-oriented economy to promote economic growth. Obviously, he wanted to avoid the failure of the Latin American economies and to apply the lessons learnt from the success of the newly industrialised economies (NIEs) of East Asia. Prime Minister also added that several industrial and technology development areas specialised in various sectors will be created soon.
According to the Global Competitiveness Report 2016/2017 released by the Geneva-based World Economic Forum, Sri Lanka ranks 71st among 138 countries in the index of global competitiveness index with a score of 4.19 out of 7. India emerged as the top rank in South Asia at 39th place. Vietnam is positioned at 60.
The report shows that our most problematic factors for doing business were policy instability followed by access to financing, inefficient government bureaucracy and tax rates.
Sri Lanka’s short-term target, therefore, should be to reach the top half of the rankings within the next three to five years. There is only one path leading to the target - the more robust growth of the industry. Without that, Sri Lanka’s long-term development prospects may be at risk.
Vietnam experience
Unfortunately, the variety of economic policy reform agendas pursued by us over the past two decades has not put the industrialisation challenge centre stage. We should have looked at East Asian success stories to seek what is needed for our country to prosper in the global economy.
Vietnam is a case in point. It appears that Sri Lanka has a lot to learn from Vietnam when it comes to the formulation and implementation of trade and industrial development policy.
Vietnam’s industrial policy framework is governed by a national Socioeconomic Development Strategy (SEDS) projected for a ten-year period. This is complemented with five-year socio-economic development plans as well as sectoral and industrial strategies and master plans.
The Ministry of Industry and Trade is responsible for conducting and supervising industrial strategies and plans, while the Ministry of Planning and Investment undertakes the implementation of five-year plans. Their portfolio also includes coordination with the private sector through its Foreign Investment Agency (FIA), Enterprise Development Agency and Department of Economic Zones.
During the initial period (1991-95), the main objective of the industrial policy was to facilitate structural change, particularly for key sectors and regions. The two main key sectors being singled out in the five-year plan were heavy industry and natural resource exploitation.
In addition, other goals included the development of the agricultural, forestry and fishery sectors in close coordination with the manufacturing sector; consumption good production and labour-intensive and export-oriented industries. The 1991-95 plan also prioritised the construction of infrastructure and transportation networks, and the modernization of the post and telecom networks.
Second five-year plan for 1996-2000 outlined the projected economic development figures. The annual growth rate for agriculture-forestry and fishery sector was, on average, 4.5-5 per cent, 14-15 per cent for the industry, 12-13 per cent for services. The structural shift that followed was mainly aimed at quickly increasing the share of industry in the economy. The Socio-economic Development Strategy for the years 2001-10 sought to achieve the country’s 10-year development targets through the acceleration of growth and development, improvements in quality both quantitatively and qualitatively, and a strong emphasis on the efficiency and sustainability of growth and development. These objectives guided Vietnam’s strategy, as implemented according to the two-five-year plan: 2001-05 and 2006-10.
The third Socio-economic Development Strategy for 2011-20 period focussed, in addition to maintaining the vision of an industrialised Vietnam by 2020, emphasising knowledge-based intensive industrial production and higher local content in products. Although heavy industries and manufacturing industries are encouraged, support is limited to those competitively advantaged to be able to join higher positions in the global value chain.
Open economy
The main lesson we can learn from Vietnam experience is that industrial development can only be achieved by restructuring industrial production. In Sri Lanka, we never had a proper long-term industrial strategy to provide adequate guidelines to the industrialists. At least now, we need a master development strategy and/or master plan setting out realisable targets/objectives and broad implementation measures with sufficient detail and feasibility assessments.
Sri Lanka is regarded as a relatively open economy. Industrial policy should, therefore, aim to facilitate the productivity gain from export activities rather than simply endorse export expansion for ensuring long-term growth of the economy. The policy should also include plans to improve the firm structure and build linkages between domestic and foreign-invested firms.
Transparency
It is a sad fact that Sri Lankan industrialists are still not prepared to take full advantage of trade and investment liberalisation for economic development even after decades of international integration. The fact that international integration comes with both challenges and opportunities is generally well understood, but in our country, concrete action to raise international competitiveness is slow to emerge. Various measures such as industrial promotion, enterprise reform, FDI absorption, and trade and investment policy are not properly integrated. Our lack of transparency and certainty in policy environment remains the most serious obstacle for domestic firms to reach the foreign counterparts. Providing clear industrial vision and stable policy environment requires the collection and analysis of detailed and up-to-date information on key domestic industries as well as global market trends, and a realistic policy-making based on such information.
Flying geese model
What Sri Lanka needs today is policy response with concrete numbers and timetables to the imminent industrial problems that the country faces today.
When we study East Asian fast-track growth, we find that those countries as a group have exhibited a unique developing pattern. One by one, countries in different development stages have achieved economic growth by participating in the production network created by private multinational corporations. Linked by trade and investment and targeting the markets of the developed countries, a system of international division of labour with clear order and structure exists in the region.
Under this system, industrialisation has proceeded through geographic widening on the one hand, and structural deepening within each country on the other. This supply-side dynamism is sometimes called the “flying geese” pattern of development.
The flying geese model intends to explain the catching-up process of industrialization of latecomer economies from three aspects: (1) Intra-industry aspect: product development within a particular developing country, with a single industry growing over three time-series curves, i.e., import, production, and export; (2) Inter-industry aspect: sequential appearance and development of industries in a particular developing country, with industries being diversified and upgraded from consumer goods to capital goods and/or from simple to more sophisticated products; (3) International aspect: subsequent relocation process of industries from advanced to developing countries during the latter's catching-up process.
The flying geese model shows us that the national goal of industrialisation and modernization cannot be achieved except through a successful linking with this regional network.
Domestic firms alone cannot compete squarely with rivals from Japan, US, EU, China, Korea or the neighbouring countries. The only practical way is to attract a large number of FDI by bold policy action and encourage local firms to link up with their activities and improve competitiveness, step by step.
However, Sri Lanka’s reality at present falls far short of this potentiality. Many foreign firms cite Sri Lanka as a favoured destination, but only a few actually come to invest.
The absorption of FDI by Sri Lanka so far remains minuscule by the Asian standard. The main reason is that the speed of systemic improvement in Sri Lanka lags behind the speed at which the outside world is changing. As a consequence, Sri Lanka continues to stay in a relatively disadvantaged position in Asian dynamism.
Strategy
We urgently need a comprehensive and long-term industrialisation strategy coupled with master plans for individual key industries. The strategy’s contents need to be consistent with Sri Lanka’s current capability, global trends, external economic policy and systemic transition policy. If the government does not clarify where the country is heading with respect to the economic regime and industrial structure, no firm will invest with confidence. The compilation of these strategies and master plans will require up-to-date information on domestic and foreign economies. Such information must be continuously analysed among concerned policy-makers and business leaders.
The outdated ideas such as the maximum use of domestic raw materials, self-sufficient industrialisation, desire for vertically integrated industrial structure and compulsion for upstream investment, cannot activate domestic or foreign investment in the age of globalisation.
Unfortunately, in Sri Lanka, very few government and business leaders adequately grasp the dynamism of the global market or Sri Lanka’s true position in it. As a result, policies and business strategies based on false hope detached from reality are often formulated.
