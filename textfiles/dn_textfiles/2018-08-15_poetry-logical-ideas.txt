Poetry of  logical ideas

My Choice, the Tamil Poetry collection in English was compiled and translated by Dr K Shriganeshan, Senior Lecturer attached to the English language Teaching Centre, an experienced and prolific writer for years. It is one of the best collections of English poems in the form of a book. This collection comprises thirty poems. The readers can recall the scars of the war in most of the poems. The struggles and agonies of human life are skillfully portrayed.
Most importantly, the readers can observe that many of the poems were penned by the women writers. This type of translation work brings the hidden talents of female poets’ name and fame to the world from the nook and corner of the nation. It’s the great opportunity for them to continue their service to their community by the words and the verses and pull out the inner struggles in an authentic manner.
Modern trend
The translations in the book are beautiful and it inspires the readers turning over the pages without feeling bored. In fact, translation has become worthy in the modern trend, which helps reach the non-native language readers. Translating a poem into another language, that is, its content, its form, its tone, its nuance, is, as almost everyone who has done it knows, a difficult task.
Eventually, it gives enormous rewards for the translator, the reader and poetry itself. Meticulously, the translator of the book ‘my choice’ has overcome the challenges with his language expertise. Be that as it may, translation is a daunting task because the translator has the immense responsibility and the goal in maintaining the meaning, the feel and liveliness of the poems when they are translated into another language. To succeed in the effort, the translator should have sufficient collection of vocabulary to give the original effect on them without changing the meanings of the poems, a merit to the translator.
Moreover, there are two main types of translations: one is the word to word translation, a strenuous task, and the other is absorbing the concept of the poem and translating into the target language. The translator of this book successfully handled the meanings of the poems using the strategies and language techniques.
Real meaning
For instance, in the poem My Choice the lines are on neither beauty nor youth, in using the word neither, the lines are shortened and the real meaning of Tamil has been simply brought out by the translator. Using the conjunctions and the punctuations in the appropriate context are very much important in the use of the English language. It has been absolutely done by the translator.
Adding to it, in the poem Paled East, the line of the second stanza, ‘malarkalai illantha malarkal,’ is very deep in meaning, clearly translated as ‘women who lost their flowers’. This shows the translator’s competency in both the languages, Tamil and English. Many of the original poems in Tamil express the human sufferings, struggles between life and death, sorrowful situations, stained and bloody experiences the people and the society underwent in the past and they were effectively and efficiently reflected in the translated versions. The apt use of metaphors and simile are very much appreciable.
For instance, in the poem, Understanding You, Unnudaiya paarvai oru neruppu, oru olipilumbuoodam, uthayam and oru uyirkolii are translated in the following way:
Your gaze is a fire
Your gaze is blaze
Your gaze is dawn
Your gaze is boat
Your gaze is killer
Using the transitional signals in writing is one of the techniques which link the sentences and paragraphs smoothly together so that they have a flow and there are no abrupt jumps or breaks between ideas. This can be noticed in the poem ‘Burdens’ where the transitional signals such as on the one hand and on the other are applied in two different stanzas.
Oru puram is on the one hand
Marupuram is on the other
Further, this collection of poems has a dramatic effect by using direct speech which adds more nativity and naturalness to the readers. As a result, the specific scene flashes in the mind of the readers.
Example 1: Burdens
I am hungry, mum (amma pasikirathu)
Example 2: Dumb Grief
Look here, open the window...
The maiden banana dances...
In Dumb Grief, the lines Are you crazy? Close the window the chill is bad... are noteworthy.
The interrogative form gives an impact to poetic verse. The translator has used various grammatical elements to keep up the originality of the poems. All in all, this book consists of poems with deeper meaning and the language used to compose the poems is concrete and thought-provoking. The readers can enjoy reading them. The themes of the poems are very dynamic and making sense. This is a very interesting application and it will be great to see what the future holds for this application in terms of additional content and features. In a nutshell, it is a very comprehensive work done by Dr K. Shriganeshan.
