Allowance for pregnant mothers to be digitized

 
The Telecommunication and Digital infrastructure Ministry together with Child Development and Women’s Affairs Ministry has taken the initiative to digitise pregnant mother’s nutritional allowance paying system.
The allowance worth Rs. 20,000, allocated per pregnant mother is paid in monthly instalments of Rs. 2000.
Currently, pregnant mothers entitled to the allowance collect their voucher from Provincial Secretariat and produces it to vendors to receive goods worth the amount mentioned.
The new system enables these women to obtain their allowance at home though any network service and transfer the voucher to the vendor, online.
Tests are still underway.
