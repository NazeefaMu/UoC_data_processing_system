Alfred Dias passes away

The sweet taste of success by the Old Bens soccer rites suddenly turned to tears when their team mate Alfred Dias suddenly collapsed and died in the dressing room moments after receiving the EdawardJayawardena Memorial Trophy after beating Old Mazenodians 5-1 in the inaugural soccer match played at Kandana last Sunday before an appreciative gathering of Old Bens and Old Mazenodians.
It is said that death comes like a thief in the night and that in life we are in death. And these sayings rang true of Dias who played his heart out in steering the Old Bens to victory over their rivals suddenly departed from this world much to the shock and grief of his team mates who stood dumbfounded.
At the inquest held at the Ragama Hospital it was revealed that Dias died after suffering a massive heart attack.
“Dias Malli” as he was fondly called by his numerous friends was just 53 at the time he was called by his creator.
Dias started and learnt his fundamentals in the game under that coach par excellence the late Edward Jayawardena at the green, white and green school at Kotahena in the late 1970’s.
Incidentally the game on Sunday where Dias bid good bye was played for the Edward Jayawardena Memorial Trophy. Jayawardena who coached St. Benedict’s and De Mazenod Colleges passed away last year.
Dias served notice of his prowess as a defendant. He captained the school in 1980 when Bens won the Brazil Cup. He was like a rock in defense and not many opposing strikers would get past him. He sported Old Bens colours and later played for the glamour boys of Sri Lanka soccer Saunders that won many F.A. Cups under the coaching of the great striker P. D. Sirisena. He played for the national team for many years. He also coached many Clubs.
After his retirement from serious soccer he turned out for the Old Bens in the veteran’s tournament and in the recently held tournament sponsored by another former Benedictine captain ThilakPeeris helped them emerge champions beating the Kurunegala team.
Dias was a lively and loveable character and would always stand up for what is right. He would not fear to call a spade a spade and not some other implement.
Sporting a crew cut and with his bonhomie was a stand out in any company. His team mates are still unable to believe that Dias who was a bundle of energy at the game he loved has passed away without a murmur. That is life. He was too young to die.
He leaves his wife Prasanthi and daughters Natasha and Theekshana.
Cortege will leave his Goonesinghepura residence at 4.00 p.m. today for burial at the General Cemetery, Borella at 5.00 p.m.
May His Soul Rest In Peace.(MGV)
