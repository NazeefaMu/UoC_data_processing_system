Kandy may be absolutely football mad, but most of its die-hard fans have rarely come closer to bringing the game back to the position where it once enjoyed. Recent weeks have seen several former footballers make the unexpected move of relocating football. Kandy football league has had a rocky history. But today it is allegedly marred by corruption, weak management, poor promotion, which at times leaves supporters wondering. To make matters worse the 2016 tournaments have still not been concluded. The 2017 AGM has not been held. It was nice to see, last Sunday veterans of Kandy and Mawanella in action. The two teams were called as Masters XI. Kandy Masters edged out Mawanella Masters by 2 goals to 1.
