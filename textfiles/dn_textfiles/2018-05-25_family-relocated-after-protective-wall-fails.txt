Family relocated after  protective wall fails

As a protective concrete wall erected in the Payagala-Gorekaduwawatta Tsunami Housing Scheme to support a loosened mound of earth had slid due to incessant rains, a family living beside it had been evacuated to an alternative house at a safe location, Beruwala Divisional Secretary Chathura Malraj said.
He said steps would be taken to restore the wall as soon as rains ceased, adding that other families living in the area too had been advised to be alert about any emergency situation.
