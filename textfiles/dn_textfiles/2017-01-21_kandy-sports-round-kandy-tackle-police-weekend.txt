KANDY SPORTS ROUND-UP: Kandy to tackle Police this weekend

Following Kandy's big win against the sailors last week this weekend's second leg Dialog league match doesn't have the same sense of anticipation as last week. Kandy is clearly an organized side that is only improving while the Cops will be struggling to break the shackles in today's game. It will take something really special from the Policemen, or some sudden reversal of poor play from Kandy to overturn the result. Several of the Police players are fighting for their future while the Kandy side wants to maintain their dominance. Hopefully no matter what the outcome but a good game of rugby should be showcased, not ending one sided. So, the stronger, smarter, and fitter Kandy rugby team who are gearing up having won all three second round games will be at Police Park to scrum down with the Policemen who went down to Airmen. Irshad Cader in charge of the whistle. In this game Kandy will try some new ploys to manacle the policemen in their own den.
Football and hockey not encouraged in Kandy? 
Can someone please tell us what on earth has happened to Kandy's club Football and Hockey? Both these sports at club level have failed once again to complete their inter club tournaments in the bygone year. Club level rugby football and hockey was the top sport in Kandy. But today the local controlling bodies are not keen in conducting tournaments, but come alive only at Annual General Meetings.
CPRFU all out to promote the game 
The Central Province Rugby Football Union which is under the leadership of a top rugger player and administrator Iswan Omar have received good response from the Girl's schools in Kandy namely - Girl's High School, Good Shepherd Convent, Mahamaya MV, Hillwood College, Pushpadana MV, Seetha Devi MV, St. Anthony's Convent, Hamamalee MV, Sumangala MV, Poramadulla MV Matale to promote rugby. To further help in the promotion they need rugby balls and coaches. Initially Tag Rugby will be introduced for the age groups of U/14, U/16, and U/18 in non-contact version. They are planning to have tournaments for age groups of U/8 to U/18; the main set back is the CPRFU has no funds.
