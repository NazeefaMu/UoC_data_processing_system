Former Import and Export Controller remanded

Former Import and Export Controller Mahagamage Gamini, who was arrested for allegedly demanding a bribe of Rs.200,000 from a businessman, was remanded till September 18 by Colombo Chief Magistrate Ranga Dissanayake yesterday.
Officers of the Commission to Investigate Allegations of Bribery or Corruption (CIABOC) told the Magistrate that investigations have not been complete. Gamini had allegedly solicited a bribe of Rs.200,000 from a businessman in Weligama to provide a report containing recommendations necessary to import two vehicles from Japan, which are around 10 years old, through legal channels.
The Magistrate ordered the Bribery Commission to submit the report on the progress of the investigation at the next hearing.
