Grace period for Lankan illegal immigrants in Israel

Sri Lanka has given its citizens working illegally in Israel a grace period till September to return to the country and legal action will be taken against those who do not return during that period, , Deputy Telecommunication, Digital Infrastructure and Foreign Employment Minister Manusha Nanayakkara said.
The deputy minister was speaking to family members of Sri Lankans working illegally in Israel yesterday. “We got a lot of opportunities for Sri Lankans to work in Israeli firms, but now we don’t get that opportunity. This is because around 150 out of 500 have not returned. We have spoken to the Israeli government and they have agreed to take back people who returned after the expiry of their work visa,” he said.
The deputy minister said that some Sri Lankans who were living in Israel illegally had lodged false human rights complaints with the Israeli authorities.
“They said that they been assaulted in Sri Lanka and that they can’t return to the country because they fear for their lives. They are alleging that there is no human security in Sri Lanka and this is tarnishing our image internationally. This is what happened to us during the war. A lot of people who never had any threats lied to get asylum in Western countries. I’m sure they benefitted personally, but millions of people living here suffer because of the consequences of such allegations,” he said. He urged the family members of Sri Lankans who are working in Israel illegally to bring their loved ones back.
He warned that they had taken steps to issue warrants to those who have violated immigration laws.
