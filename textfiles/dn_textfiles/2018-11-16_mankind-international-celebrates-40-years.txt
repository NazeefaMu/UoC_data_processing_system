Mankind International celebrates 40 years

Mankind International Limited, one of Sri Lanka’s leaders and pioneers in employment placement celebrates 40 years in operation this year. Launched in 1978 as Maritime International Ltd, the company was rebranded as Mankind International Limited in 2015.
Maritime International carries one of the oldest active license numbers from the Foreign Employment Bureau, “With Maritime International starting to focus more on foreign employment placements, we did our first diversification by launching Maritime Placements (Pvt.) Ltd. to handle all local placements,” commented Fayaz Saleem, Chairman. Further development resulted in establishing Executive Search Limited, to specialize in overseas placements.
Mankind also introduced headhunting to Sri Lanka, through its subsidiary, AIMS. To date Mankind International Limited has placed individuals at many management, higher management positions in leading organizations in the country.With employment placement as its core business, Mankind commenced a Corporate Sustainability activity under HR Solutions, a training programme for young executives and managers.
The revolutionary spirit continues witnessed by the latest venture, Mankind IT, specializing in IT placements. Mankind IT will specifically speak to the IT professional, identifying, recruiting and creating careers within the country for an industry which suffers much brain drain due to the lack of proper placement.
Mankind International Limited will continue to specialize further according to the needs of the clientele and the changes in the industry.
The organization will always seek newer and better ways to create the best possible careers for Sri Lankans at all levels.
