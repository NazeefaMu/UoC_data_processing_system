Fresh perspective, new blood and Sri Lanka Rugby realities

All hail the end of a busy and match specific month on planet Sri Rugby.
Schoolboy rugby particularly fabulous and really a great potential of winning new hearts, plus a new generation of adoring fans, who will follow these young gladiators, to the ends of our remarkable earth..rain or shine.
Sri islanders rugby certainly glamorous enough and defiantly making a comeback as the island’s most successful and popular sport.
Naturally Sri cricket...and only international limited overs format, command the fans and fanatical following.
Domestically rugby is miles ahead both at school and club levels...with the singular exception of the traditional big match phenomenon.
This season club rugby was a Kandy story and sincere graft from Havelocks, CR, Navy, plus a resurgent CH.
But Kandy were bottom line ...professional, consistent and oozing with talent from prop to full back.
The Kandy bench depth too strong and hard to match all through the intense, unforgiving Dialog league and knockouts.
All told, bar a few errors, the team to beat led by the upcountry champ the much chastised, but still sharp Gayan Weeraratne was Kandy all season long.
Looking forward to that performance pendulum swinging between CR, Havies and CH for sure.
Sri Lanka Rugby, former SLRFU, carries our resilient elephant forward, contemplating a massive integrated pro active team buzzing with ideas and plenty of inherited rugby acumen.
Lasitha Bonsa Gunaratne, definitely has some XXXL shoes to fill after Asanga really set our island code on the right path.
Investment and brand partnerships breaking and breathing a new lease of life from the ground up.
This formidable rugby union edifice has to be acknowledged as the future and sustainability at all costs.
The new era demands maximum from administration and players alike.
Expectations bubbling past phenomenal, whichever angle you approach it from.
Time for our spanking new rugby executive to set the bar at a maximum unheard of in Sri Paradise.
Achievement and high performance the significant signature tune at Independence Square. My belief is a simple ambition to be the most competitive, most dynamic and biggest heart in Asia.
With that defined silk route...we must harness all the rugby Intel and IQ possible...Priyantha E, Rohan G, Rizly I, Nazeem M, Dilroy F, Tony A, Michael Jaya, Rohan Abey, Rohantha P, Hisham Abd, Nalin de S, Marso H, Duminda de S, Saman Jaya, Jamaldeen, Marikkar Imt, plus pure adrenaline experience in the middle for Sri Lanka the best qualifying status going.
Arguably a little out of the box and just outside our 22m, but still good ball to carry forward for Chief Bonsa.
