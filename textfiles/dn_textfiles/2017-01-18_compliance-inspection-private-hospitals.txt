Compliance inspection on private hospitals

A gazette notification will be issued next week to authorise officials attached to the Health Ministry Raid Unit to inspect all private hospitals, sources said. According to the sources, Health Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne ordered health officials to complete the private hospital regulation system and the report within two months. The report will be prepared by an international company called K.P.M.G.
The Health Ministry will inspect medical tests, surgeries, OPD treatment, sale of drugs and all the other sections and functions of all private hospitals. The gazette notification will grant powers to the Senior Assistant Secretary, Assistant Secretary and other officials of the Raid Unit of the Ministry to inspect private hospitals, the sources said.
Minister Dr. Senaratne ordered the Chief Executive Officer of the National Medicines Regulatory Authority to make arrangements to introduce rules and regulations to make sure that all pharmacies issue a bill for every customer for purchasing drugs, the sources added.
