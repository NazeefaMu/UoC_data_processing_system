GMOA to take action if provincial health charters signed

The Government Medical Officers' Association (GMOA) would take stern trade union action if governors attempt to sign and implement provincial health charters, GMOA Secretary Dr. Haritha Aluthge said.
Addressing a press conference held at the GMOA Headquarters in Colombo yesterday, he said governors had not yet signed it. At the moment, the health service of the country is an island- wide service. Former President Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga issued a gazette notification and declared the health service an island-wide service after the GMOA launched a two-week strike in 1990.
According to Dr. Aluthge, at present, efforts are being made to segment the health service and bring it under the power of provincial councils. Letters had been sent to doctors to enroll themselves in the provincial health service. This is an attempt to divide the country.
The GMOA requested the President to use his powers to stop this procedure. The entire health service would be devastated and all health professionals would have to leave the country if this comes to pass, Dr. Aluthge said.
