Watering holes
A landmark Indian Supreme Court decision in December 2016 somehow missed out on being reported in our mainstream media. The judgement banned the sale of liquor along all highways and roads throughout India including those that fell within municipal limits. Inter alia the petition contended that 400 deaths take place every single day on Indian roads caused mostly by drunken driving.
Evidence of the earliest use of alcohol in the form of fermented grain spirals back to 7000BC and there’s no disputing the fact that alcohol will be consumed by mankind till the end of time. But it is indeed sad that, manufacturers of spirits never wholeheartedly promote responsible consumption nor do they issue warnings that, their products should not be used as a crutch for poor coping skills. Or, where one can seek help if you are unlucky to become dependent on their product! Is it asking for too much?
Millions of people enjoy social interaction glass in hand or a pre-dinner tot (or two) at home somewhat comfortably. But there are millions who are either tottering at the edge or engulfed already in the throes of addiction causing misery and destroying the fabric and souls of their families. It is then left to the very few low key organisations to attempt to rescue, counsel and rehabilitate them.
Sri Lankan roads are dotted with “Wine Stores” but what worries me is why they open at 9 a.m.? Do such opening times promote the use of alcohol as a crutch to those who are vulnerable? It certainly does, and it is plain to see if you care to observe the two legged traffic to and fro, pre noon and early post noon.
Some checks and balances could be initiated even though it will cause an uproar, strikes by wine store owners and immediate condemnation from the Joint Opposition. I propose the shutters should open at 5 p.m. and promise not to petition the Supreme Court.
