H’tota incident: 32 further remanded: 16-year-old boy among suspects

 Thirty two suspects, including a Buddhist monk arrested on charges of violating a court order and damaging public property during a protest in Ambalantota on Saturday, were further remanded till January 16 by the Hambantota Magistrate’s Court yesterday.
A 16-year-old boy who was among the suspects was ordered to be kept under custody at a facility run by the National Child Protection Authority in Galle.
Police on Saturday arrested at least 40 people over the clash in Hambantota when crowds gathered to protest the opening of the Sri Lanka – China Industrial Zone.
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe and Chinese Ambassador Yi Xianliang opened the zone and security was stepped up in the area.
A court order was also issued barring demonstration or protests in selected areas. Despite these measures, protesters converged in Hambantota and clashed with each other and the Police, hurling rocks and injuring over 20.
Tear gas and water cannons were used to ease the situation.
