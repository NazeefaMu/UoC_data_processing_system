Kalu Ganga irrigation project nearing completion

Work on the Kalu Ganga project of the Moragahakanda – Kalu Ganga Irrigation Project is now in its last stages of completion, a spokesman for the project’s public relations unit said.
This project once completed will provide irrigation for 8,200 hectares of farmland in the Matale, Anuradhapura and Polonnaruwa districts, ending their irrigation problems.
The project will also help add a harvest of 300 metric tons of inland fish to the national economy, public relations officer P.G. Dayananda said.
The project will also ensure the sustainable economic development of nearly 13,000 farmer families and solve the flood problem in Manampitiya and Somawatiya areas, he said.
