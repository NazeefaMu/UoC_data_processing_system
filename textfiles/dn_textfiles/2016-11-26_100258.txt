We shine the ball the same way: Smith

South Africa captain Faf du Plessis doesn’t expect to be sledged over theball-tampering controversy during the ongoing third Test in Adelaide -because the Australians shine the cricket ball the same way.
But former Australia skipper Ricky Ponting says du Plessis is lucky to escape the saga without a ban for a clear breach of International Cricket Council regulations.
The Proteas skipper was fined his entire match fee by the ICC after he was found guilty of ball tampering during the Hobart Test, but avoided being banned for the third match of the series.
On Thursday, du Plessis again pleaded his innocence and said the ruling “opens up a can of worms”.
And he doesn’t believe the Australians will use the scandal against him during the Adelaide Test because shining the ball is part of the game.
“The Aussies won’t talk about it at all because they know its part of their team as well,” du Plessis told reporters.
“(The controversy) has not been driven by the (Australian) cricketers at all. There’s been no comment whatsoever from them, in fact it’s all been positive comments.
“I even read a comment from Darren Lehmann supporting and backing me, which was really good to see.”
Australia Test captain Steve Smith didn’t reject du Plessis’ comments and said his side shines the ball “the same way”.
“Every team around the world shines the cricket ball,” Smith said. “I have seen Faf’s comments in his press conference. And I make it veryclear that we haven’t come out and said anything about Faf or about how he was shining the ball or anything like that.
“We along with every other team around the world shine the ball the same way.”
Ponting, however, said Du Plessis was lucky to be cleared to play the match in Adelaide.
“I’ve been a little bit disappointed with the way they’ve acted, to tell you the truth,” the former Aussie skipper said in Melbourne.
“As has been shown, he’s been proven guilty. They’ve made out that it was all a storm in a teacup when he’s actually broken an ICC (rule).
“He’s got a 100 per cent match fee (fine) — he was probably lucky not to get a game (suspension). It’s not the first time he’s done it, either. But the game goes on.
“These things happen in the game all the time and you move on. - CA
