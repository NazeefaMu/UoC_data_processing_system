NCPA launches probe into 582 child abuse complaints

The National Child Protection Authority (NCPA) has commenced investigations into 582 complaints of incidents within the first quarter of 2018 on child abuses, NCPA chairperson Marini de Livera said.
She said the majority of the incidents were reported from the Colombo, Gampaha and Kalutara districts. Incidents of cruelty experienced by children in schools and within their homes were also included among the complaints. These complaints were reported to the NCPA through the hotline 1929. The NCPA has commenced speedy inquiries on these complaints with the NCPA Special Police Investigation Unit connecting with relevant police stations across the island. Some complaints were directed to the Labour Department as well, the statement said
“The NCPA will work towards ensuring that the perpetrators will receive maximum punishments and conducting special awareness programmes centered around the entire society and schools to prevent such crimes from taking place in the future.
When children experience cruelty their entire personality gets destroyed.
