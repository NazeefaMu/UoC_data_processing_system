Making Lanka great

Rationalists say that the average human tendency is to ‘copy’ one way or the other, when one desires an immediate answer or an outcome but have not worked for it. Obviously Lankans are no exceptions. It’s often a kind of automatic sharing of a ‘free’ environment.
Equality of humans and acceptance of common ethical beliefs morally entitles us to use each other’s outcomes as our own. Since the arising of the Buddha, various religious leaders emerged among humans showed the equality of all humans. Hence, such belief based ethical outcomes belong to a common pool. When others’ moral outcomes are ‘taken’, without accepting the common belief of human identity, then naturally that will be challenged and leads to conflict and war. A system without equality of humans and such regulations, we tend to develop human jungles.
President Mahinda Rajapaksa brought his brother Gotabhaya Rajapaksa from USA to eliminate the LTTE – not to follow rules but to break them where needed by his side. Their argument was Premier Ranil Wickremesinghe made a blunder by signing a peace agreement on the basis of equality of humans. ‘Such Buddhist principles are fraudulent’ they said. They needed to invoke the animal in their army to defeat the LTTE who freed themselves from the limits of Common Laws of Sri Lanka.
Human ethics
Mahinda forgot that laws are not ethics of humans but social agreements. To that extent they became animalistic. The awareness of this challenge faced by Mahinda Rajapaksa was strongly indicated by Norwegian Minister Erik Solheim who quoted Mahinda Rajapaksa in reference to the LTTE Leader ‘He is from the jungles of the North. I am from the jungles of the South. Let’s see who will win!’
Laws do not represent human ethics, the need to act based on meththa, karuna, muditha and upekka. But Laws do restrict our cleverness. They also help us ‘share’ our wealth through our common values. Such sharing is important in development of heirs who would carry forward and laterally spread our humanistic experience. Heritage and teachings confirm this commonness.
While Mahinda, as said above, violated ethical way forward, LTTE also violated the connection to heritage by method of terror, excluding mass participation, oppressing helpless kith and kin. However the peace agreement with Prime Minister Wickremesinghe compelled them to come out and make proposal for open participation in an appointed government. Mahinda and his gang by violent action in the south removed the possibility of implementation of this peace agreement. During this period TNA supported the peace agreement thus making LTTE indirectly the sole representative of Tamils.
The above is the only argument for the LTTE’s claim that they were the sole-representatives of the Tamil Community, while claiming to oppose the elected government accepted by world community. In Marxist terms too struggle of the oppressed should be open to the proletariat and the oppressed. That is why Tamils too say the above is a lie because the author does not have a position that represents a whole nation. In formal democracy, the entire nation can question only through a referendum or through Lawful Policy carried out unanimously by all their elected members.
Violence against minorities
The above confirms the existence of latent terrorism in media and political campaigns in the Sinhala society. Time to time this latent power burst out with violence against minorities in Lanka. If LTTE were terrorists for doing so– then so is the media and the political campaigns that are terrorizing Democracy. It is therefore disappointing to note the lack of depth demonstrated by private media and Sinhala hegemonistic political campaigns. However, now Tamils generally say that in selection of officers for powerful positions in the state, the Yahapalanaya has shown commonness to all Lankans. That is how natural structures should be shared.
Yahapalanaya as a government elected by the democratic people had to represent their true aim as Lankan oppressed and confirm that they could win even in a disorderly environment; disturbed by racism. Through this natural selection – Yahapalanaya also invoked all those who have invested in multi-culturalism from various parts of the world and in Lanka from the past too. It is common understanding among Tamils that had the LTTE not sold out their voting rights – Ranil Wickremesinghe would have become President in 2005 and all together would have prevented the 2009 tragedy which has now become a dark global picture.
The Good Governance
In Sri Lanka, it is still possible the government we elect paving for the triumph of tribalism and the return of the strong man. Like The Donald of US, we too have Mahinda and Gotabhaya, promising to make Lanka Great again, by making it a Rajapaksa- Regime, again.
The Good Governance government is not so good! Still, the right to criticize, to oppose remain, and occasionally achieves something worthwhile – like parliamentarians deciding not to avail themselves of a pay hike. Ven. Galagoda Aththe Gnanasara Thera has been sentenced to prison, because judicial independence has been restored to some degree.
If the Rajapaksas return, one of their first tasks will be to cow the judiciary into submission again.
The independent audit commission has finally being sworn in. That was thanks to the 19th Amendment, which will be thrown aside, if the Rajapaksas return.
We do not want fascistic governance again.
