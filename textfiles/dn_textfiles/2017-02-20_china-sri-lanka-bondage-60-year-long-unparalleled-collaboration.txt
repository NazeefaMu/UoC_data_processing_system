China, Sri Lanka bondage: 60-year-long unparalleled collaboration

On February 7, a historical day dawned for Sri Lanka. The Embassy of Sri Lanka in Beijing and the Embassy of the People’s Republic of China in Colombo were opened on February 7, 1957.
Chinese Premier Zhou Enlai visited Sri Lanka on January 31, 1957 and met Sri Lankan Prime Minister S.W.R.D. Bandaranaike on February 7, 1957 and laid the foundation of the bilateral diplomatic relationship. During the past 60 years, the relationship has grown very much.
Whatever administration came into power in Colombo, they did not waive their Chinese connection. Chinese unshakable political stand for the Governments of Sri Lanka during the past 60 years too has been unique.
The global policy of the People’s Republic of China on inter-state relations has always been on five noble principles of the peaceful co-existence. China supports Sri Lanka on these principles; mutual respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity, non aggression, non interference in internal affairs, equality and mutual co-operation, and peaceful co-existence of both countries.
China objected several occasions at the UN Security Council when Western imperialist interfered in the internal affairs of Sri Lanka.
During the prolonged war against terrorism, while many powerful countries overtly and covertly supported the LTTE, China openly stood by Sri Lanka. The victory against separatists in 2009 was possible because of Chinese unshakable support towards Sri Lanka.
Sri Lanka too have contributed to the People’s Republic of China and China always appreciate Sri Lanka in this regard.
On January 6, 1950, Sri Lanka supported China as the 13th country to recognise the new People’s Republic as an independent and sovereign state. When China was economically isolated and blocked by the Western imperialists and their puppets, Sri Lanka went ahead to sign the famous Rubber-Rice Pact with China in 1952. While China’s legitimate position in the United Nations was blocked by the USA and its allies, while Taiwan was illegally placed in the UNO, Sri Lanka upheld the One China Policy and insisted that the People’s Republic should be unconditionally placed in the UNO General Assembly and the Security Council.
The Anniversary of 60-year-old diplomatic relations scheduled for this February is not just another event. It strengthens almost all fields of bilateral necessities and would definitely reach a nonparallel position through implementing the Maritime Silk Road International Project. The proposal is expected to flourish during the next decade as the next golden chapter of Sri Lanka-China diplomatic relationship.
