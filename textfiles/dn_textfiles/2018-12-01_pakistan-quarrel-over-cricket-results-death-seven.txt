Pakistan: Quarrel over cricket results in death of seven

Seven people died in a shootout between two groups after a dispute erupted over a cricket match in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province of Pakistan.
The exchange of fire took place after the two parties reached to a police post in Abbottabad for registering a case against each other.
A quarrel had occurred between their children while the kids were playing cricket. As both the involved rivals exchanged bullets, at least seven persons lost their lives. As quoted by PTI one police said, “One party opened fire to which the other party, which was also armed, retaliated and responded with gun fires”.
Three deaths took place from one party and four from the second.
