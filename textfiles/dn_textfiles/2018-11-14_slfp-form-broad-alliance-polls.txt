“We are currently having discussions on creating a common symbol for us. Many other parties and alliances will join hands with us. Therefore, we would like to contest under a common symbol”, he said. Dr. Piyadasa further said that they are also currently formulating the manifesto for the party with the support of professionals and academics.He said they are planning the election campaign and the measures that need to be immediately taken to face it successfully.
