Ports Authority clarifies allegations against Magampura Port

The Sri Lanka Ports Authority yesterday refuted allegations that a group of workers of the Magampura Port Management Company (Pvt.) Limited (MPMC) were terminated and their salaries were not paid for several months.
The Ports Authority stated that several inaccurate and misconceived reports relating to the MPMC and the Sri Lanka Ports Authority (SLPA) were circulating in the recent past.
"The allegation that the employment of the workers of MPMC has been terminated is false and SLPA categorically rejects it. The salaries of all employees for November were paid despite attempts by some workers to cause delays in the payment by sabotaging the administrative functions of the MPMC," the Authority says in a statement.
"We understand the MPMC will continue to pay salaries till further notice and further steps are taken according to law. The MPMC has clearly and repeatedly given the employees these assurances, however, the workers for reasons best known to them have continued to engage in illegal and wrongful activities that prejudice the security of the Magampura Port and the general need for law and order in the area," the statement says.
"There are proceedings before an Industrial Court to decide what relief the employees of MPMC are entitled to upon MPMC's closure. The SLPA and MPMC will continue to participate in these proceedings. MPMC has also offered to all its employees a “voluntary resignation scheme” with substantially higher compensation than what is required in teams of the law, which a group of employees has already accepted," the statement says.
"The Magampura port in its present state is economically non viable and the State is saddled with heavy debt and debt servicing costs. The Government took a policy decision to enter into a Public Private Partnership to infuse needed investments to the Magampura port to make it financially viable and to reduce public debt.
"It is in these circumstances the MPMC asked its employees not to report to work from November 30. The MPMC has no work to offer but has nonetheless assured employees that their salaries will continued to be paid.
