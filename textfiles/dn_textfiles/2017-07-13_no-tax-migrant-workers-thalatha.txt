No tax on migrant workers: Thalatha

Foreign Employment Minister Thalatha Athukorala yesterday, assured that she would be the first to oppose any move to charge a tax on migrant workers.
She was participating at a function held recently to distribute self employment aids for 25 beneficiaries who have been registered with the ‘Shramika Surekuma’ programme.
The Minister said that around 1.5 million Sri Lankans are currently engaged in overseas employment. But, none of these workers work happily and they have selected this path to fulfil the basic needs of their family members since they haven’t any other way to do so.
“Sri Lankan migrant workers form the largest source of income in terms of foreign exchange brought into the country. So as a responsible government, we accept that we can never neglect the service of migrant works and we also pledge to extend our fullest support whenever necessary,” she said.
President Maithripala Sirisena included pledges and proposals for the benefit and welfare of Sri Lankan migrant workers in his Presidential election campaign manifesto for the first time in Sri Lanka and measures have already been taken to fulfil these pledges.
She said the ‘Shramika Surekuma’ programme was the first to be introduced by the President in January 2016 and around 300,000 migrant workers have already registered with this programme.
