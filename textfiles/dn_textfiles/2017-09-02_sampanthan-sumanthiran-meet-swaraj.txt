Sampanthan, Sumanthiran meet Swaraj

Tamil National Alliance Leader and Opposition Leader R. Sampanthan along with TNA Jaffna District Parliamentarian Sumanthiran met with the Indian External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj today.
Sampanthan briefed the Minister on the present status of the Constitutional making process and cautioned that it must be given priority.
He said that given the fact that there had been a lot of work done on the matter, it could not be delayed any longer and the drafted Constitution must be approved by Parliament before the year end and the referendum must be held thereafter.
He urged the Foreign Minister to exert their good offices to ensure that this is delivered as per the promise given by the Government of Sri Lanka to the people of the country and to the International community.
The Indian External Affairs Minister reaffirmed the support of Indian Government in this regard and assured the continuous support to see an end to the process.
