More benefits  for journalists

Measures will be taken to increase the Asi Disi Media Scholarship payment from this year and to upgrade Sri Lanka Media Training with the intention of encouraging and providing opportunities for journalists to improve their professional skills, said Finance and Mass Media Ministry Secretary Dr. R.H.S. Samaratunga.
He was addressing the award ceremony of Asi Disi Media Scholarships held yesterday at the Finance and Mass Media Ministry Auditorium.
The Ministry has started various programmes to make the public aware of the Right to Information Act, said the Secretary.
Finance and Mass Media Ministry Director (Media) K. P. Jayantha said the selection of beneficiaries was conducted in a transparent manner without any political intervention.
Having both Finance and Mass Media under one ministry is an additional advantage for us to make these programmes a success, he said.
He said the objective of this annual scholarship programme is to assist media personnel to improve their knowledge to be better media personnel.
A total of 60 journalists serving in recognized electronic and print media institutions on full-time or part-time basis as well as freelance journalists were awarded scholarships at the ceremony, he said.
He added that the payments for course fees to follow postgraduate courses, short and long-term certificate courses and diploma courses conducted by local universities and government higher education and training institutions will be made by the ministry subject to a maximum of Rs. 100,000 on the basis of non-recovery.
Additional Secretary (Administration and Finance) Ramani Gunawardhana and Additional Secretary (Development and Planning) J. M. Thilaka Jayasundara also participated.
