‘True identities of illegal vehicles submitted to courts’

True identities of nearly 300 illegal and suspicious vehicles were submitted to courts, Government Analyst's Department Director General A. Welianga said. These include vehicles with forged chassis numbers and assembled ones, he said.
Welianga said true status of suspicious vehicles could be established by subjecting them to analysis by his department.
