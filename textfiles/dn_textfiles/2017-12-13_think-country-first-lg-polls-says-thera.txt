Thera also urged the public to divide politicians as patriotic and non patriotic without considering their colours and cast their votes only for the patriotic politicians.
Ven. Abhayatissa Thera said that the voters should cast their votes only for the patriotic politicians those who come in to an agreement with the public on certain principles such as not to support any attempt of bringing a new Constitution or hunting war heroes and not to sell public property.
"If the politicians do not come to a written agreement on these facts, they will definitely lead to the total destruction of the country and all the politicians should be responsible for that,the thera said. Former MP Sarath Weerasekara said that public should consider the upcoming local government election as a referendum and cast their votes against the government.
