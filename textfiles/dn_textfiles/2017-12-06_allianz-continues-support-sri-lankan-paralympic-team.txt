Allianz continues to Support Sri Lankan Paralympic team

Allianz Lanka has extended its support to the Sri Lankan Paralympic team by another two years. Allianz, which has been a partner of the International Paralympic Committee (IPC) since 2006 and became its first International Partner in 2011, has supported the Sri Lankan team since 2013. The new sponsorship agreement was signed at Allianz Insurance Lanka Ltd, Head Office, Colombo by Surekha Alles, Managing Director, Allianz Insurance Lanka and U.R. Rodrigo, President, National Paralympic Committee.
Commenting on this strong partnership, Surekha Alles, “Allianz is committed to promoting inclusion, diversity, and
excellence, both in the workplace and in the world of competitive sports. And through this partnership, we support the athletes’ passion for what they do, their ambitions to achieve their goals and their remarkable ability to believe in themselves, which mirror Allianz’s own values.”
At the 2012 summer Paralympics in London Sri Lanka won their first medal when Pradeep Sanjaya placed third in the men’s 400m T46 to clinch the bronze. The Rio 2016 summer Paralympics saw Sri Lanka take home their second medal when Dinesh Priyantha Herath placed third in the men’s javelin throw F46.
“We are happy to have the continued financial and technical support of Allianz Lanka. Their active promotion of Paralympics and their shared commitment to the core values of the Paralympics – courage, determination, inspiration, and equality – have brought greater prominence to the event,” said U. R. Rodrigo.
Allianz Insurance Lanka Ltd. and Allianz Life Insurance Lanka Ltd., known together as Allianz Lanka, are fully-owned subsidiaries of Allianz SE, Germany, a world leader in integrated financial services. Having started out as a Greenfield operation in 2005, it has emerged as one of the fastest growing insurance service providers in Sri Lanka.
