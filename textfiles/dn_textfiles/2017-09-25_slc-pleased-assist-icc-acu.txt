SLC pleased to assist ICC ACU

Sri Lanka Cricket yesterday confirmed that the ICC ACU has commenced a preliminary inquiry in Colombo with regard to various allegations that had been circulating in the recent past.
At a meeting held on Saturday at SLC headquarters the Executive Committee issued a directive to all SLC officials and employees to extend their fullest cooperation providing any and all information required in order to assist the ACU in a thorough inquiry.
Commenting on the inquiry, SLC Chief Executive Officer Ashley de Silva stated: “We are most pleased that the ICC ACU has decided to initiate this inquiry. We request all those who have any information to come forward and help with this inquiry by declaring all their information and evidence rather than casting aspersions from the sidelines and damaging the reputation of our players, our cricket and our nation.
“We believe this will exonerate our national players, who themselves have requested an inquiry. We are committed to working closely with the ICC to complete this inquiry expeditiously and give our players the freedom to concentrate on playing their cricket without the cloud of these various allegations, which no doubt affect their game, hanging over them.”
