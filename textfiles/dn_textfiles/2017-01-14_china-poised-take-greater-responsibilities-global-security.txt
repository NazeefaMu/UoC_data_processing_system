China poised to take greater responsibilities on global security

China in a white paper on policies related to Asia Pacific security on Friday said that the country is prepared to take on greater responsibilities for regional and global security, and provide more public security services to the Asia- Pacific region and the world at large.
The white paper said China will increase military exchanges and cooperation, which would support peace and stability in the Asia-Pacific region. China will build a strong national defense force that is commensurate with China’s international standing.
The white paper on policies related to Asia-Pacific security cooperation, which also clarified the nation’s stance on issues of regional concern.
The white paper was released by the State Council Information Office.
Outlining China’s concept of common, comprehensive, cooperative and sustainable security, the white paper explained the Chinese approach to achieving peace and stability in the Asia-Pacific region.
The policy package includes the promotion of common development; the building of partnerships; improvement of existing multilateral frameworks; rule-setting; military exchanges; and proper settlement of differences.
Noting the role that major countries in the region play in maintaining peace and development, the white paper urged them to reject the Cold War mentality, respect others’ legitimate interests and concerns and to pursue positive interactions.
Small and medium-size countries need not and should not take sides among big countries, the white paper said. All countries should work toward a new dialogue system instead of confrontation, and pursue partnerships rather than alliances, according to the white paper.
China said it supported the creation of international and regional rules set through discussion with all countries concerned rather than being dictated by any particular country.
Rules of individual countries should not automatically become international rules; and countries should not be allowed to violate the lawful rights and interests of others under the pretext of rule of law, according to the white paper.
China is prepared to take on greater responsibilities for regional and global security, and provide more public security services to the Asia-Pacific region and the world at large, it said.
