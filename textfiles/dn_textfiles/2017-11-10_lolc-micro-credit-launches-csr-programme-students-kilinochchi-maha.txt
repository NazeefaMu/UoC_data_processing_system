LOLC Micro Credit launches CSR Programme  for students of  Kilinochchi Maha Vidyalam

LOLC Micro Credit Limited (LOMC), Sri Lanka’s largest and only microfinance provider to have received the prestigious certification for Client Protection Principles, is a subsidiary of the LOLC Group.
The company recently launched a social responsibility initiative to uplift the facilities of Kilinochchi Maha Vidyalam in the Northern Province. Kilinochchi Maha Vidyalam is the largest school in the Wanni, known also as the heartland region of Sri Lanka.
As part of its social responsibility agenda, LOMC refurbished the computer laboratory of Kilinochchi Maha Vidyalam and donated twenty (20) desktop computers with a view to making ICT accessible to the students of the school. As phase one of the CSR project, the playground of Kilinochchi Maha Vidyalam was redeveloped and trees were planted under LOMC’s island-wide tree planting programme.
Sharing his sentiments about this worthy cause, Ravi Tissera, Director and CEO of LOLC Micro Credit Limited said, “LOMC has been active in the Northern province since 2009 and strong bonds have been forged between our borrowers since then. We continue to uphold these relationships by going beyond the customer perspective, through many livelihood support programs and this CSR project is a demonstration of our continuous support to the communities in which our customers live in.”
Speaking about LOMC’s CSR initiative, the Principal of Kilinochchi Maha Vidyalam, Jeyanthy Thanapalasingam said, “We can clearly see that LOMC is not a company that has limited itself to being a mere microcredit provider with financial targets.”
