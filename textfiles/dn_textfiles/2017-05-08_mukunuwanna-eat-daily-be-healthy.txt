Mukunuwanna : Eat daily, be healthy!

Mukunuwanna is another ‘must have’ inclusion when it comes to Sri Lankan Cuisine and is one of the main courses in a meal in Sri Lanka. Garden Talk speaks to Deputy Provincial Director of Agriculture, District Agriculture Instructor K.N.K Jayathilake on this highly popular leafy vegetable which is delicious and nutritious.
“Nowadays Sri Lankan consumers are very concerned about eating leafy vegetables and consume them on a daily basis. One reason is that it is highly appetizing and contains quantities of Vitamin, Calcium and Iron. Mukunuwanna can easily be grown in a home garden and has been cultivated in a village or urban home garden since days of old,” said Jayathilake.
Mukunuwannna over the years has become so popular when it comes to Sri Lanka gastronomy alongside so many other vegetables.
“When it comes to Mukunuwanna it can be used as a curry. It can be used as ‘Kola Kanda’. It can also be used as a Salad. It has also value as a medicinal herb. This is because of the high quantities of Vitamin, Calcium and Iron in Mukunuwanna. This is why it is highly recommended to be eaten on a daily basis,” stated Jayathilake.
When it comes to Mukunuwanna, it is easy to find planting material and can be easily grown in a home garden. Also it does not take much capital to grow Mukunuwanna.
Commercial value
“It also has great commercial value and is cultivated on a commercial basis in Colombo. It can be harvested every month up to a period of two years - which means that every month the farmer can get a good income. After two years you have to cultivate anew. That is a significant feature of Mukunuwanna. This means the cultivator can receive a good income from an acre commercially. When starting to cultivate, it has to be done during the rainy season,” pointed out Jayathilake.
l When it comes to cultivation, low country wet zone is ideal, however it needs to be irrigated throughout the year when it comes to the highlands.
l When it comes to the soil, it has to be wet soil with a good drainage system. The soil has to be PH 6.0 – 7.0.
l The temperature needs to be around 28 Celsius.
l The soil must be fertile and needs organic manure. If the claylike quality in the soil is there, then there needs to be a good drainage system. Also if it is clay you need to include a lot of organic manure.
l When there is less rainfall you need to irrigate – add water. When there is too much rainfall you need a drainage system.
“Of course since there is no adequate rainfall during all times of the year, growing Mukunuwanna must be started during the rainy season. When there is inadequate rainfall during the year we irrigate. This is when we are doing it on a commercial basis. In a home garden we can cultivate any time of the year since it is done on a small scale. They can be grown in pots and beds. The soil needs to be fertile. It needs organic manure. In a drought period you need irrigation,” explained Jayathilake.
Varieties
“There are many varieties of Mukunuwanna. There is the Bush type. Then there is the creeper. When it comes to Creeper it can be further divided when it comes to the shape of the leaf and the color of the stem. One is the
Piliyandala variety. It is a recommended variety. The leaf has an ovate shape and the stem is light green. There is another variety with an ovate leaf, and the stem is brown and green. Then there is another variety which is
Lanceolate in shape with a green or brown stem,” explained Jayathilake. The
Bush type is mainly used as an ornamental plant coming in many colors –
Red Mukunuwanna, Green Mukunuwanna and Green and Yellow Mukunuwanna. It is divided according to colors. The Green variety is edible. The other two varieties are not normally consumed by people. These bush type plants can be kept for a length of time by pruning. “Mukunuwanna is cultivated by stems/ a cutting. The stem is the planting material. The stem can be 10 – 12 cm. It can also be grown through seeds. From the flowers the seeds fall to the ground and get planted. They fall naturally to the ground and give rise to the plant,” added Jayathilake · Before planting, the soil must be prepared. The weeds must be removed. The weeds cause the harvest to suffer. The quality is low. They cause disease. They suck the nutrients in the soil. It causes competition with the plants. · For a good drainage system you need to make drains (in case of too much rainfall) · The soil must be leveled · You need to irrigate and then only can the cuttings be planted. (In case of drought season) · Also you need to cover with coconut leaves – mulching. · There needs to be a distance between the plants – 10cm or 20cm. · There needs to be daily irrigation · Organic manure must be applied –
Poultry Manure and Cow Dung – 1 hectare – 10 tons of Organic Manure. · Even after planting, you can apply Organic Manure. There are many dangers to the plants by caterpillars that eat the leaves. Since the leaves are lush they are attacked. After planting, in four weeks it can be harvested. Then every month you can reap the harvest.
