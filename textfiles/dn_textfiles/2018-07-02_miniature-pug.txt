Miniature Pug

As you can see, tiny Otis-Woody’s head is about the size of a tennis ball. This sweet little guy is four months old and only four inches tall.
The Cleethorpes-based pup may just be the smallest pug in the country – weighing in at just a couple of pounds – and may just pick up the title in the Guinness World Record books.
His owner Rachel East thinks he could be in with a shot, and that he may actually be the smallest example of the breed worldwide.
Otis has five sisters who are more than three times his size, but due to the fact he was the runt of the litter, he never quite caught up growing. Rachel calls the happy boy her ‘cheeky little monkey’ because he is so energetic and ‘a little bit mischievous’. Apparently, he loves to chew on everything from tennis balls to feet and socks.
Whenever Rachel walks Otis, she ends up getting accosted by tons of people who (understandably) want cuddles and pictures.
She said, “Every time I take him for a walk with his little kitten lead people are constantly stopping me and telling me how adorable he is and that he is so cute, and all I am really able to tell them is that I know, he is just wonderful. He is brilliant with my children Sienna and Brinley who just adore him. The only problem is that we have to be so careful whenever we walk around the house because he is so tiny we are worried that we might stand on him as he darts about between our feet.”
Rachel will likely need to wait until Otis-Woody is fully grown before they enter him into the record books, but he doesn’t seem to be showing any signs of a growth spurt just yet.Metro
