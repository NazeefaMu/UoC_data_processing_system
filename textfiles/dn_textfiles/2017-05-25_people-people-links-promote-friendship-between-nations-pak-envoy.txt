People-to-people links promote friendship between nations: Pak Envoy

An eight-member student delegation, along with their teachers from The City School, Lahore, led by Shazia Zahid, is visiting Sri Lanka from May 24 to 28 under a Student Exchange Programme with Harcourts International School.
The students visited the High Commission of Pakistan today for a briefing.
The Acting Pakistani High Commissioner to Sri Lanka Dr. Sarfraz Ahmed Khan Sipra, while briefing the students, highlighted that Pakistan and Sri Lanka enjoy excellent relations and there is a strong will on both sides to further develop and promote these ties.
Dr. Sarfraz Sipra emphasized that such visits and people-to-people contacts are an excellent way to promote understanding and friendship between the two nations. He added that more frequent people-to-people contacts through enhanced student and faculty exchanges between learning institutions of the two countries would further stimulate this relationship. He assured that the High Commission would continue to patronize and support such initiatives.
During their stay in Sri Lanka, the students’ delegation would also visit Kandy and Galle.
