GMOA to strike again over SAITM

A joint islandwide strike will be launched by the Government Medical Officers' Association (GMOA) along with the Anti SAITM People's Barricade on September 21, if the Government fails to offer a real solution to the SAITM issue, GMOA Secretary Dr. Haritha Aluthge said.
Addressing a press conference held at the GMOA Head Quarters in Colombo yesterday, he said the GMOA along with the anti SAITM Organization request the President and Prime Minister to offer a practical solution to the SAITM issue that could be acceptable to the entire country and not only to Dr. Neville Fernando.
According to Dr. Aluthge, the GMOA received information that a 'committee' is to be appointed to regulate medical education.
