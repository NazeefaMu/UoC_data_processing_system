President recollects Tsunami tragedy

Today (26), let us be reminded of humanity’s duty towards nature and the need to build and sustain a safe environment, tweeted President Maithripala Sirisena yesterday.
“It has been 13 years since a deadly Tsunami claimed the lives of thousands of unsuspecting people, rich and the poor alike”, read the President’s tweet further.
The 2004 Tsunami claimed close to 40,000 lives as it caught a nation unawares on Boxing Day.
