SLFP to announce alliance by weekend

SLFP General Secretary Prof. Rohana Lakshman Piyadasa yesterday said the SLFP will be contesting the upcoming General Election under a broad national alliance that will include all leftist, nationalist, and patriotic political parties.
Speaking to the media yesterday at the SLFP Headquarters, the General Secretary said discussions have already started with all parties and the final decision on the alliance would be taken by the end of this week. He said that the symbol of the new alliance is yet to be decided.
Responding to a question by a journalist with regard to the SLFPers who joined the SLPP, the General Secretary said that these type of incidents are common to the SLFP and rather than paying attention to these incidents, the SLFP and other coalition partners will focus on the defeat of the common enemy at the upcoming election. There were issues within the party since the 1950s, but the SLFP overcame all these issues and never went into total political oblivion, he said.
