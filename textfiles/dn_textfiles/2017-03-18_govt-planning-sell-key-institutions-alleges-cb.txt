Govt. planning to sell key institutions, alleges C.B.

Former Minister and MP C.B. Rathnayake yesterday alleged that the government was planning to sell key government institutions such as SriLankan Airlines, Colombo Port, the CEB, Ceylon Petroleum Corporation and the National Water Supply and Drainage Board citing they were inefficient and suffering losses.
Addressing a media briefing in Colombo yesterday, Rathnayake said it was an utter lie to claim that they were being sold due to their inefficiency and losses. The CPC earned a profit of Rs.9 billion last year while the Sri Lanka Ports Authority earned a profit of Rs.10 billion.
Therefore, why does the government want to sell these profit earning institutions?
“The government should be held responsible for any losses incurred by government institutions. We know most of the state institutions are inefficient at present. Are they going to sell them too?” Rathnayake asked.
