Glorious uncertainties

The realignment of political forces continues in the aftermath of the failed motion of no-confidence against Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe with all eyes now on the much-expected Cabinet reshuffle, which is due shortly.
Ironically, even though the motion of no-confidence was aimed at destabilising the United National Party (UNP) by inviting dissent within the party and encouraging UNP Parliamentarians to vote against their leader, its net result has been the exact opposite, a destabilisation of the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP).
Parliamentarians of the SLFP are now scattered in three camps: those who remain loyal to President Maithripala Sirisena and remain in the Cabinet because they abstained from voting in support of the no-confidence motion, those who still profess loyalty to the President but voted in support of the no-confidence motion and will therefore now sit in the Opposition and those loyal to former President Mahinda Rajapaksa.
The first group has now dwindled to about twenty-five MPs. Most of them will be in line for Cabinet portfolios when the Cabinet is reshuffled. They would have to however first overcome resistance from the party’s highest decision-making body, the Central Committee.
Failed no-confidence motion
When the SLFP’s Central Committee met following the failed motion of no-confidence, there was a strong sentiment that the party should quit the government and then let the UNP form a minority government. Only a few opposed this but among them were party heavyweights President Sirisena and former President Chandrika Kumaratunga.
There has been growing speculation that the ‘group of sixteen’- SLFP ministers, deputy ministers, state ministers and the Deputy Speaker- who voted for the motion of no-confidence- will eventually join President Rajapaksa’s camp and the Joint Opposition (JO).
These MPs have in public refused to comment on such a plan and insist that they will function as an ‘independent’ opposition group within Parliament while still maintaining their loyalty to the President. However, Rajapaksa has publicly declared that it is only a matter of time before they join the JO and has said that he would warmly welcome them because “they are not strangers”.
On Monday, SLFP veteran, former party General Secretary and former Minister S. B. Dissanayake said that “the group of sixteen” was trying to prevail upon the entire Central Committee of the SLFP to take a common stand to leave the government. “If the President decides that the SLFP should leave, that will virtually be the decision of the Central Committee,” Dissanayake said.
In fact, there have been moves by sections of the JO and the renegade SLFPers to try and wrest the post of Leader of the Opposition from Tamil National Alliance (TNA) leader R. Sampanthan. The JO’s rationale is that if a further sixteen SLFP MPs joining its ranks, it would become the single largest opposition group in Parliament- and therefore be entitled to nominate the Leader of the Opposition.
Unfortunately for the JO, this is an argument that has been mooted before. Even now, the JO, which is still an unofficial entity in Parliament, is the single largest opposition group in Parliament. However, Speaker Karu Jayasuriya has ruled that they are not entitled to nominate the Leader of the Opposition as the party they contested from, the United Peoples’ Freedom Alliance (UPFA), is still part and parcel of the government.
Cabinet portfolios
Thus for the JO’s current plans to nominate the Leader of the Opposition to reach fruition, it must first ensure that all SLFPers leave the government. That, at this point in time, is a tough target to achieve as President Sirisena is quite insistent on carrying the remaining twenty-five SLFP members with him for the rest of the tenure of this government.
The feeling that the UNP should be allowed to form a minority government of its own is not confined to the SLFP. Backbenchers in the UNP too feel the same way and question the leadership as to why they have to burden themselves with the baggage of the SLFP while in government.
The answer to that is that both President Sirisena and Prime Minister Wickremesinghe are keen to have as many MPs as possible working with the government. It was said that the government lost its two-thirds majority when the sixteen SLFPers defected to the opposition, but the government is optimistic that, with about 130 MPs supporting it, it could even muster a two-thirds majority on an issue-by-issue basis, enlisting the support of the TNA as well as the Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP).
In the coming days, there is a need for much give and take between the UNP and the SLFP in allocating Cabinet portfolios. While there is general agreement that the portfolios currently held by both parties will retain their status quo, some changes are likely with a few ministries changing parties. The Samurdhi Ministry and the Ministry of Public Administration have been earmarked for such changes.
While the government is busy finalising these plans, a declaration about the fate of the Executive Presidency from JO parliamentarian and former Minister Bandula Gunawardena has come under fire from within the JO itself.
Gunawardena, a former Minister of Education who once infamously proclaimed that a family of four could sustain itself on two thousand and five hundred rupees a month, has expressed his support for the abolition of the Executive Presidency- a move proposed by the JVP which is sponsoring a 20th Amendment to the Constitution to this effect- provided Parliament is dissolved immediately thereafter.
In reality, Gunawardena’s support for the concept amounts to nothing because his precondition- that of dissolving Parliament immediately- will never be passed by the current Parliament which has a constitutional mandate to govern until August 2020. Nevertheless, his comments have raised a hornet’s nest with some sections of the JO opposing the idea.
In the extremely unlikely event that the abolition of the Executive Presidency becomes a reality before 2020, the JO would stand to gain, though. That is because there would then be no barrier for its leader, former President Mahinda Rajapaksa to lead its campaign.
Next presidential election
At present, Rajapaksa cannot run for President again and there is speculation that his brother, former Defence Secretary Gotabhaya Rajapaksa will be the JO candidate at the next presidential election. The younger Rajapaksa would, of course, have to run as the nominee from the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP), the newly set up political party of the JO which recently emerged victorious at the local government elections.
The SLPP is not the only party which has its sights set on the next presidential elections. General Secretary of the SLFP, Duminda Dissanayake was to proclaim last week that President Maithripala Sirisena would be the SLFP’s candidate in the next presidential elections. “President Sirisena is the one and the only politician who had the capability to win the 2020 Presidential election and therefore, he would be the indisputable Presidential candidate of the SLFP”, Dissanayake said.
That statement is noteworthy because President Sirisena, during his presidential election campaign and on several occasions thereafter has pledged not to run for President again. However, it must also be noted that since those pledges were made, the political landscape in the country has undergone several seismic shifts, the most notable of which is the emergence of a new political entity, the SLPP, loyal to the Rajapaksas, as an alternative to the SLFP.
In such circumstances, it could be argued that the President feels an obligation to run for President, given that his first presidential election campaign was aimed at dislodging the Rajapaksa’s from power.
If political currents flow in their predicted direction, the presidential contest in 2020 could, for the first time in the country’s history will be a three-way contest- but the glorious uncertainties of politics in Sri Lanka are such that, with some twenty months more for the election, predictions are best avoided.
