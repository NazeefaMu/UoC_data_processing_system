Medical experts say that anyone suffering from fever for more than two days should seek immediate medical treatment from a state hospital or a qualified doctor without applying home remedies. Only Paracetamol should be taken to control fever. All medications except Paracetamol cause fatal complications such as Dengue Haemorrhagic Fever (DHF), Dengue Shock Syndrome etc. Getting delayed to seek medical treatment can lead to complications and death.
