‘Lanka governed by Buddhist principles’

Petroleum Resources Development Minister Arjuna Ranatunga said Sri Lanka does not require a military dictatorship because it is governed by Buddhist ethics and culture.
He said the development of the country depends on ensuring justice and equality rather than military dictatorship.
He said so during a programme to distribute sports equipment at Mirigama, recently.
“We came to power to govern the country under the ‘Yahapalanaya’ concept. We don’t govern the country by killing and hurting people. No one is allowed to establish a military dictatorship in the country. As a Buddhist country, we have been following Buddhist ethics since birth. We are not in need of a military dictatorship,” he pointed out.
“We should stand against the people attempting to establish a ‘Hitler’ leadership, disregarding races and religions. We should not be afraid to make decisions. When I was the Ports Minister, I was not afraid to sack thieves.
“I followed the same principle in the Petroleum Ministry, too. The President and Prime Minister should take action against culprits. That’s what the country needs rather than a ‘Hitler dictatorship’,” Minister Ranatunga added.
