Introduction of new Constitution, a timely need - UPFA National List MP

It is a timely need to introduce a new Constitution since the foundation of the present Constitution has cracked, President's Counsel and UPFA National List MP Dr. Jayampathy Wickramaratne said.
He was addressing a media workshop on Constitutional reforms yesterday.
"As everyone expects, moves are being taken to introduce a most suitable Constitution to the country," he said.
Dr. Wickramaratne said that the Executive Powers along with the Executive Presidency was further strengthened with the passing of 18th Amendment to the Constitution in Parliament during the Rajapaksa regime. With the 18th Amendment, former President Rajapaksa could create the most powerful Executive Presidency in the world. However, those powers were significantly curtailed by the 19th Amendment to the Constitution, which was introduced in Parliament by this government.
"It is expected to implement the domestic mechanism under the provisions in the present Constitution in Sri Lanka. At this juncture, every political party should actively participate in this Constitutional reforming mechanism," he said.
"There is no point in formulating the third Constitution of Sri Lanka without the participation of all parties, civil society organisations and the public. He pointed out that such participation could not have become a reality when formatting the 1972 and 1978 Constitutions, since they were formulated without their contribution.
He further said the country needs a modern Constitution with a far sighted vision. While refuting allegations of certain politicians, he said the Government has no intention whatsoever to bring a ready-made daft and present it to Parliament.
"With a view to have the ideal and most appropriate Constitution, public opinions, views and suggestions are being sought from around the country through a commission and presented to Parliament.Civil organizations too should have dialogues on the topic," he said.
