Citizens' Mail

Why the former premier failed in his job
There are various ways to analyze why the former Prime Minister failed in his job. This is the way I look at this problem. According to our rules and regulations, President is the chief. The Prime Minister is second in command.
He should have treated President as his boss. There is a way to manage your boss. I have indicated below the important rules to follow when working with your boss:
Be a problem solver. Not a problem creator.
Stay calm even when everything around you is in a state of chaos.
Never make excuses.
Make your boss good look. No one has ever achieved greatness by putting someone else down.
Be a consistently positive force. Discipline yourself to seek the positive in every situation.
Whether you like it or not, this is the correct way to work with your boss. Otherwise there will be confusion and disappointment. Hope this lesson will help the biggest person in an organisation and also the junior officers.
