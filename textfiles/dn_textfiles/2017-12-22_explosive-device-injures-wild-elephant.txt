Explosive device injures wild elephant

An elephant injured from a haka patas explosion was found frail and dying after 15 days when residents of Moragoda informed the relevant Wildlife officials. Although the wildlife officials tried to rescue the elephant, they found out that due to the lack of food, the elephant was malnourished and weak. The elephant had sustained serious injuries to its mouth in the explosion.
The residents in the area complained that their crops were continuously destroyed by elephants. They were however advised not to use such explosives and that the officials would provide a solution.
Hakka Patas’ are improvised explosive devices illegally kept in crops to keep wild animals away and kill smaller ones.
