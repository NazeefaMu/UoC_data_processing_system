Parliament to take up 20th Amendment on Wednesday

The 20th Amendment to the Constitution, which proposes for holding the elections for all provincial councils on the same date, will be taken up for debate in Parliament on September 20 as per the Schedule, UPFA General Secretary and Fisheries Minister Mahinda Amaraweera said.
He said Speaker Karu Jayasuriya will announce the Supreme Court ruling on the legality of the 20th Amendment to the Constitution when Parliament meets on September 19.
“If the SC rules that Parliament needs a two-third majority to pass the amendment, the house will debate the draft bill on the amendment on the following day. But, if it calls for a referendum, the party leaders will discuss and decide a way forward,” he added. (IR)
