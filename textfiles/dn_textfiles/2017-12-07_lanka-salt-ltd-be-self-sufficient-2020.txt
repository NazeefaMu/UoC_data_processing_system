Lanka Salt Ltd. to be self-sufficient by 2020

The management of the Lanka Salt Limited expects to be self-sufficient in salt by 2020 according to the plans drawn up in relation to the present production capacity of salt.
New salt fields have been created at the Hambantota, Bundala and Palatupana salterns. The old machinery and equipment have been replaced with new ones for proper functioning of the salterns. The extent of the salterns is 2,600 acres.
The Lanka Salt Limited chairman said that when the new board of management came into existence in March, 2016, it was found that the salt had been sold under-cost, resulting in a heavy loss.
The new board of management appointed agents island-wide and increased the price of salt to cover this loss. He said that at the moment, there are 66 agents for the distribution of salt. Continuing, the chairman said that the total consumption of salt is 150,000 metric tonnes, where 120,000 metric tonnes are for domestic use, while the rest is used by the industrial sector. He added that by October, 2017, the salt harvest was 85,000 metric tonnes, and by the end of the year 2018, it is expected to be increased up to 110,000 metric tonnes.
