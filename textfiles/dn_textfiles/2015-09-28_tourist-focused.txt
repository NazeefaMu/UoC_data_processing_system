Tourist Focused!

Taking into account, the robust growth of the global tourism industry, this year’s World Tourism Day celebrations, which fell on September 27th was themed ‘One Billion Tourists and One Billion Opportunites’. Taking this theme as an impetus, the students of the first batch of the Executive Diploma In Tourism, Event and Hospitality Management (EDETHM) of the University of Colombo (UOC) organised the Tourism Leaders’ Summit on ‘Billions of tourists, billions of opportunities in MICE tourism and sustainable tourism development in Sri Lanka’, which was successfully concluded at the Bandaranaike Memorial International Conference Hall (BMICH). John Amarathunga, Minister of Tourism Development and Christian Affairs participated as chief guest while many other dignitaries including academics, professionals of the tourism sector and the local business community were also present at the event.
One of the highlights of the event was a demonstration by Sri Lanka’s culinary master Chef (Dr) Publis Silva who presented his expertise on how Sri Lankan culinary could be projected in promoting Sri Lanka tourism. Further, in recognition of his decades of dedicated service in urging people to foster an enthusiastic attitude towards traditional Sri Lankan cuisine, he was felicitated with a token of appreciation, as a mark of respect for his illustrious career.
The summit, organised with the key objectives of identifying new opportunities in order to create diversified MICE and other tourism businesses, and promoting innovative and analytical thinking to develop such business and thereby exploit emerging markets, was an ideal knowledge sharing platform for industry stakeholders, which enabled them to deliberate on stressing issues of Sri Lanka tourism. Moreover, it brought together the public and private sector institutions such as the Sri Lanka Tourism Promotion Bureau (SLTPB), Sri Lanka Tourism Development Authority (SLTDA), Sri Lanka Association of Inbound Tour Operators (SLIATO) and Sri Lanka Association of Professional Conference, Exhibition and Event Organizers (SLAPCEO), paving way for an forum, which gathered the inputs of both these sectors on strategizing the way forward for Sri Lanka Tourism.
In his address, Minister John Amarathunga said that tourism is one of the most dynamic sectors that contribute towards the global economy. It is a leading sector that makes a contribution of 10 percent to the global GDP and six percent of the world’s total exports. “I am extremely thankful to the university of Colombo for organising this event. In order to develop tourism sector of Sri Lanka, it is important to develop synergies between government agencies, academic institutions and industry stakeholders. This gives an immense opportunity to address the challenges we face in tourism industry at present. Sri Lanka is marching towards a new era of prosperity after 30 years of ethnic crisis and civil war. Hence, tourism industry plays a pivotal role in the economic growth of Sri Lanka. Development of this industry is crucial to the country to earn the much needed foreign currency.”
