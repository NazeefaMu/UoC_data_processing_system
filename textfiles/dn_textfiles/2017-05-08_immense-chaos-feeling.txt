Immense chaos of feeling

“I have resolved on an enterprise which has no precedent”, begins Rousseau’s Confessions, “and which, when complete, will have no imitator.” He was right about the lack of precedent and wrong about the rest. Rousseau’s imitators even imitated the terms of his boast: “It is a thing unprecedented in literary history”, wrote Wordsworth of the poem on the growth of his own mind, now known as The Prelude, “that a man should talk so much about himself”. There are “no precedents that I am aware of”, mused Thomas De Quincey in Confessions of an English Opium Eater, for his particular brand of “impassioned prose”. There was, said Evan Charteris, the first biographer of Edmund Gosse, “no model” for Father and Son, “no predecessor in literature”.
Rousseau did not, of course, invent the literary confession, but he was the first, suggests Alex Zwerdling, to unmoor his memory and set it afloat with no helmsman at the tiller: “I will say everything”, Rousseau announced, “the good, the bad, in sum, everything”. How much was “everything”, and how could everything be contained? While St Augustine, Rousseau’s precursor, selected his experiences and shaped his journey, Jean-Jacques courted his own chaos – “this immense chaos of feeling”, as he called it. Rousseau’s Confessions is not the expected career narrative, accounting for how the son of a Swiss watchmaker became the presiding spirit of the age. It presents instead a fevered tale of lies, disloyalty, abscondment, petty theft (an apple, ripe asparagus, drawing paper, a theatre ticket), a false accusation that cost a trusting young servant her job (“Oh Rousseau, I thought you were a good fellow”), and the routine deposit of his illegitimate “brats” – five in all, each wrenched from the breast of their mother, Thérèse Levasseur – to the steps of a foundling hospital.
The generational conflict
Readers search in vain for the insights and humility we now require of autobiographers. “I am made unlike anyone I have ever met”, proclaims Rousseau, removing himself from any sense of communal identity. He plunged into his life and he plunged into the telling of his life: “the further I go into my story, the less order and sequence I can put into it”. Onto this formless and never-to-be-finished mass he imposed no shaping structure or “narrative arc” because he had no interest in, or knowledge of, a narrative self. Rousseau was our first episodic autobiographer. “Looking ahead”, he explained, “always ruins my enjoyment.”
So why did this book, described by Zwerdling as “incoherent, self-indulgent, self-aggrandising, embarrassing [and] often irrational”, exert such power over Wordsworth and De Quincey? Why was Rousseau’s Confessions so beloved by George Eliot and Emerson, why did Virginia Woolf lament that there was no woman’s autobiography to compare with this, and why did John Ruskin, according to Charles Eliot Norton, feel that Rousseau, who was “unlike anyone”, was so like Ruskin himself that he “must have transmigrated into his body”?
The Rise of the Memoir traces, in seven rich and subtle chapters, the influence of Rousseau’s Confessions on Gosse’s Father and Son, Woolf’s “A Sketch of the Past”, George Orwell’s memoir of prep school bed-wetting, “Such, Such Were the Joys”, Nabokov’s Speak, Memory, Primo Levi’s If This Is a Man and The Truce (published in America as Survival in Auschwitz and The Reawakening), and Maxine Hong Kingston’s Warrior Women and China Men. Zwerdling’s catholic selection allows him to move from memoirs that bare the self to those that bear witness; from private exposures to collective experience. Each writer, he argues, transformed the form (memoir is not, Zwerdling insists, a “genre”) to “meet his or her particular ends”. And each writer left behind an archival trove which enables Zwerdling to consider his or her editorial decisions, omissions and silences. Gosse, for example, chose not to include in Father and Son an exchange of letters that take us straight to the heart of the generational conflict he sets out to describe, because they also take us “more deeply into his adult experiences than he wanted to go”. The blending of close reading with contextual analysis is one of the pleasures of Zwerdling’s own enterprise.
Leaving untouched
What Rousseau gave his inheritors, Zwerdling suggests, was a determination to catch those aspects of their lives “associated with loss, solitude, shame, confusion, and discontinuity”. Each of the memoirs discussed here is born of and propelled by loss – of home, of language, or of parents. Rousseau showed how consciousness could triumph over turbulence, how consistency of character – what Gosse called “the hard nut of individuality” and Orwell the “incorruptible inner self” – could master the instability of the past. Rousseau placed, again and again, his “hard nut of individuality” on what Zwerdling calls “the borders of the incomprehensible”. His Confessions might look like the work of an amateur, but it involved risk and required courage. A memoir, Rousseau proved, was the writer’s ultimate challenge. He understood, as Woolf put it, that because “real life has no crisis”, memoirs must equally “lack centre” and “amble on”. Under Rousseau’s tutelage, childhood became, for Woolf, “many bright colours, many distinct sounds; some human beings, caricatures; comic, several violent moments of being . . . and all surrounded by a vast space . . . . Nothing remained stable for long”.
Most importantly, perhaps, Rousseau showed that the confessional “I” must be both exceptional and commonplace. Clarke Blaise puts it like this: “To convince you to read my book, I must convince you of my uniqueness, but to resolve the book, I must conclude with a vision of my lowest common humanity. Otherwise I will be a grotesque, someone memorable and unrepeatable”. If Rousseau was a grotesque, “unlike anyone”, then everyone, including Ruskin, was quite like Rousseau.
With the rise of the memoir comes the demise of the personal pronoun (“the so-called personal pronouns”, noted Barthes in Roland Barthes on Roland Barthes; “everything happens here”). Because Zwerdling vaults from Rousseau in the first chapter to Edmund Gosse in the second, leaving untouched the turbulent adolescence of autobiography, we cannot trace the shift from the first person of the Confessions to the more diffident pronouns employed by Rousseau’s twentieth-century descendants. What we know is that Rousseau’s “unlike anyone” became Primo Levi’s quite like everyone. Levi, who envied Joseph Conrad the invention of Marlow because he “exempted him from the anguish of having to say ‘I’”, preferred to speak of “we” and “our”. Writing collectively gave his memories, Levi hoped, more documentary reality. Gosse, who found “I” impossible, variously appears as “the writer” or “the son”, having introduced himself, in the opening sentence of Father and Son, as one of the “two temperaments, two consciences, and almost two epochs” whose battle he would here narrate. Orwell’s journalistic “I”, Zwerdling notes, is democratic. He wants to record what he has seen without recording himself. Even when confiding his misery at prep school, Orwell shifts to the second person: “At eight years old you were suddenly taken out of this warm nest and flung into a world of force and fraud and secrecy, like goldfish into a tank full of pike”.
Originally published
The memoirs discussed by Zwerdling were born of ambivalence and “fierce resistance”. Witness the gestation periods. “Such, Such Were the Joys”, an essay of 20,000 words, was years in the making and appeared only posthumously; Gosse began Father and Son, which he published anonymously, a full decade after he conceived of the work; Nabokov’s Speak, Memory, originally published as a series of essays for the New Yorker, took three decades to reach its final form. The Truce was finished fifteen years after If This Is a Man, whose story it immediately continues; Virginia Woolf’s “A Sketch of the Past”, in which she recalls her brother’s sexual abuse, was not printed until two decades after her suicide; and China Men went through at least eight drafts. So why, Zwerdling wonders, do these reluctant confessors condemn themselves to print at all? Why make public the perceived shame, guilt, or abjection? This is what bothered Thomas Hardy.
“I knew, of course from cursory remarks of yours”, Hardy wrote to Gosse, having read Father and Son, “that you had had some experiences of the sort . . . . I wonder what finally decided your printing them?” What do memoirs require of their readers? The question is at the heart of The Rise of the Memoir.
